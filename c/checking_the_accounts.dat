The justices of the peace at the quarter sessions {{had a role in}} <b>checking</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounts</b> of the poor rate.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{occurrences of}} book money {{are not known}} exactly. The giro system itself {{can be traced back}} to the [...] "bancherii" [...] in Northern Italy, {{especially}} on the Rialto (a financial center, resembling the modern day Wall Street). Originally these were money changers sitting at their desk ("bancus" [...] = bench) that customers could turn to. They offered an additional service to keep the money and to allow direct transfer from one money store to another by <b>checking</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounts</b> in their storage books. Literally they opened one book, withdrew an amount, opened another book where the amount was added. This handling was naturally a very regional system but it allowed the money to circulate in the books. This led finally to the foundation of the [...] "Banco del Giro" [...] in 1619 (in Venetian language, Banco del Ziro) which gave the blueprint for similar banking systems. The usage in German language can be seen in the Banco del Giro founded in Vienna in 1703 (to extend the financing business that Samuel Oppenheimer had brought from Venice in 1670).|$|E
50|$|According to {{the results}} of Steve Pope's investigation, Tolbert's {{conviction}} {{was the result of a}} lawyer who admitted he failed to read the police reports, witnesses interviews and other discovery material which established Tolbert's innocence. Tolbert's conviction was based in large part that the couple were experiencing severe financial hardship, that Liz Tolbert was bouncing checks and had drained their <b>checking</b> <b>account.</b> <b>The</b> state presented witness testimony at her trial that Tolbert's husband Junior had removed her from <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> shortly before <b>the</b> murder. Documents obtained by Steve Pope during his investigation, yet available to her lawyer before the trial, clearly establish that Liz Tolbert was never removed from <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> <b>account,</b> had bounced one <b>check</b> and <b>the</b> <b>account</b> was not negative prior to the murder.|$|R
50|$|A converged {{charging}} system {{is described as}} having {{the ability to control}} services and manage balances in real-time. This includes, for example, authenticating <b>the</b> subscriber and <b>checking</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> balance before service delivery to the end user. A converged {{charging system}} can also notify users when <b>the</b> <b>account</b> balance threshold set by the operator is reached, or terminate service connectivity when real-time charging indicates that credit has been depleted. This real-time capability can be used to deliver promotions and notifications to service users to stimulate usage.|$|R

It allowed the user to for example look up currency rates, <b>check</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> balance, see <b>the</b> transactions done on <b>the</b> <b>account</b> and receive text messages notifying about actions done on <b>the</b> <b>account.</b> <b>The</b> <b>account</b> holder was able to choose how often those notifications should arrive with the options ranging from monthly up to after each action takes place. It was also noted right away that there are plans to provide a method for doing payments via mobile banking as that was not initially possible saying that this marks {{the start of a}} new generation of services.|$|R
50|$|The Shetab (Interbank Information Transfer Network) {{system is}} an {{electronic}} banking clearance and {{automated payments system}} used in Iran. The system was introduced in 2002 {{with the intention of}} creating a uniform backbone for the Iranian banking system to handle ATM, POS and other card-based transactions. There are no charges for money withdrawal in this network. Transferring money between two accounts in a same bank is free but between different banks costs from 5,000 to 9,000 (for amounts of 50,000 to 30,000,000) per day, and <b>checking</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> balance costs IRR 1000 for other banks' cards. Other services are currently free.|$|R
5000|$|U.S. banks extract {{fees from}} {{automatic}} teller machine transactions that are made at rival banks, even if the customer's home bank has no branch {{in a particular area}} (such as when the customer is on vacation). Customers are sometimes charged twice, both by the bank that owns the ATM, and again by their bank. Bank of America charges a denial fee, literally a fee for refusing service to the customer (if there are insufficient funds or a daily limit), and a fee to simply <b>check</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> balance at a [...] "foreign" [...] (other bank's) ATM.|$|R
50|$|Tang {{retired in}} 1987, handing {{the reins of}} {{corporate}} leadership to the second of his three sons, Tang Wee Sung.

50|$|This is {{particularly}} valuable for taking business checks or company <b>checks</b> because often <b>the</b> {{identity of the}} person writing <b>the</b> <b>check</b> {{has little to do}} with <b>the</b> company <b>check.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>account</b> history database, a good account with no flags would receive full approval, regardless of the status of the employee who writes <b>the</b> <b>check</b> because identity is not verified.|$|R
5000|$|Solomon Male {{campaigns for}} greater {{financial}} accountability in churches. He {{says that the}} practice of giving land, cars or household goods to pastors in exchange for blessings, known as [...] "sowing seeds of faith", is widespread in Uganda, and is generally not included in <b>the</b> churches' <b>accounts.</b> He reports that such donations are not even reported to boards or auditors, but are treated as the personal income of the pastors. Following up his report, the newspaper Sunday Vision <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounts</b> of twelve Pentecostal churches, some of which were known for the practice; none declared any income from [...] "sowing", and despite receiving billions of shillings, only Kampala Pentecostal Church and Redeemed Church had their accounts professionally audited.|$|R
50|$|Besides {{commercial}} and government services, the bank offers a large variety {{of services to}} the consumer including bill payment services (Boleto), ATM loans, and a single package that contains <b>the</b> <b>account</b> numbers for <b>checking,</b> multiple savings accounts, and investment <b>account.</b> <b>The</b> <b>account</b> holder may apply for international MasterCard and Visa debit cards which act as both a credit card on a loan account, and as a debit card on <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> (a little different from the arrangement in many other countries, where both the debit and credit functions of a debit card act on <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> <b>account).</b> <b>The</b> list of services offered encompass many complex automatic functions from ATMs and online such as {{a wide variety of}} loans, automatic payments, Brazilian bill payments, and deposits to other Brazilian accounts. Many merchants routinely accept account-to-account transfers as payment for goods.|$|R
50|$|The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, Charles Masterman {{had been}} the Liberal MP here since gaining the seat from the Conservatives in 1906. However, his December 1910 {{re-election}} was later declared void after his defeated Conservative opponent had petitioned the courts. This meant a repeat election was required. Masterman's agent had been found guilty of corrupt practices. The Counsel for Masterman admitted that the expenses had exceeded the legal limit, and that the agent, who was in bad health, had failed to <b>check</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounts.</b> <b>The</b> counsel for the petitioner (the defeated Conservative candidate), while contending {{that it was impossible}} to avoid bringing the petition, in view of the illegal proceeding which had been shown, publicly stated that no imputation bad been made against Masterman's integrity, honour, or conduct. In giving judgment the Judges fully concurred with these observations, but declared {{that it was impossible to}} give relief and excuse the irregularities disclosed.|$|R

50|$|However, Senator Teofisto Guingona III {{said that}} the AMLC denied having audited Corona's account.

50|$|The {{reasons for}} receipt of bad checks mostly {{relate to the}} party issuing <b>the</b> <b>check</b> not having {{sufficient}} funds available in the amount presented for withdrawal from <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> <b>account.</b> Other reasons that checks may not be honored include <b>the</b> <b>account</b> holder cancelling <b>the</b> <b>check</b> to deliberately withhold payment; <b>the</b> <b>account</b> holder's funds being frozen; <b>the</b> <b>account</b> not actually existing due to a false check being presented; and damage to <b>the</b> <b>check.</b>|$|R

5000|$|... the Comptroller of the Household (nowadays a sinecure, {{invariably}} held by {{a government}} whip in the House of Commons). The office was established {{as part of the}} Wardrobe (a powerful department of household and state) in the 13th century, in order to maintain a <b>check</b> on <b>the</b> <b>accounts</b> of <b>the</b> Treasurer of the Household.

60|$|It is {{confidently}} {{believed that}} {{by limiting the}} offices for receiving subscriptions to less than one tenth of the number authorized by the experiment already tried, and designating the county seat in each county for the purpose, {{the control of the}} department will be rendered satisfactory; particularly as it will be {{in the power of the}} Auditor, who is the officer required by law to <b>check</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounts,</b> to approve or disapprove of the deposits, and to sanction not only the payments, but to point out the place of payment. If these payments should cause a drain on the principal offices of the seaboard, it will be compensated by the accumulation of funds at county seats, where the contractors on those routes can be paid to that extent by the department's drafts, with more local convenience to themselves than by drafts on the seaboard offices.|$|R
5000|$|... 'The Household General' {{is a term}} coined in 1861 by Isabella Beeton in her manual Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management. Here she {{explained}} that the mistress of a household {{is comparable to the}} commander of an army or the leader of an enterprise. To run a respectable household and secure the happiness, comfort and well-being of her family she must perform her duties intelligently and thoroughly. For example, she had to organise, delegate and instruct her servants, which was not an easy task as many of them were not reliable. Isabella Beeton's upper-middle-class readers may also have had a large complement of [...] "domestics", a staff requiring supervision by the mistress of the house. Beeton advises her readers to maintain a [...] "housekeeping account book" [...] to track spending. She recommends daily entries and <b>checking</b> <b>the</b> balance monthly. In addition to tracking servants' wages, the mistress of the house was responsible for tracking payments to tradesmen such as butchers and bakers. If a household had the means to hire a housekeeper, whose duties included keeping <b>the</b> household <b>accounts,</b> Beeton {{goes so far as to}} advise readers to <b>check</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounts</b> of housekeepers regularly to ensure nothing was amiss.|$|R
