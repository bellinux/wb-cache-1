40|$|Recent {{results suggest}} that a <b>crucial</b> <b>crossroad</b> for quantum gravity is the {{characterization}} of the effective dimension of spacetime at short distances, where quantum properties of spacetime become significant. This is relevant in particular for various scenarios of "dynamical dimensional reduction" which have been discussed in the literature. We are here concerned {{with the fact that}} the related research effort has been based mostly on analyses of the "spectral dimension", which involves an unphysical Euclideanization of spacetime and is highly sensitive to the off-shell properties of a theory. As here shown, different formulations of the same physical theory can have wildly different spectral dimension. We propose that dynamical dimensional reduction should be described in terms of the "thermal dimension" which we here introduce, a notion that only depends on the physical content of the theory. We analyze a few models with dynamical reduction both of the spectral dimension and of our thermal dimension, finding in particular some cases where thermal and spectral dimension agree, but also some cases where the spectral dimension has puzzling properties while the thermal dimension gives a different and meaningful picture.

40|$|The {{development}} and commercialisation {{of genetically modified}} (GM) agricultural crops has drawn attention to a complex challenge facing trade diplomacy - the challenge of regulatory regionalism created by social regulatory barriers. Social regulations associated with GM crops have been enacted to ensure food safety, environmental protection and moral, ethical and religious preferences. Regulatory regionalism exists at the transatlantic level where GM crops approved as safe in North America have been delayed or denied market access in the EU because of divergent social regulations. As domestic social regulations have emerged on the trade agenda trade diplomacy is at a <b>crucial</b> <b>crossroads</b> because the traditional integration approach of trade diplomacy fails to acknowledge the endogenous political economy factors responsible for the social regulations within a particular jurisdiction. The research reveals that maintaining the traditional approach will erode public support for trade diplomacy and marginalise it as a viable force in international integration. Given the shortcomings of the traditional trade approach, this study then identifies a regulatory {{development and}} integration framework contributing to regulatory stability and enhancing the potential for transatlantic regulatory integration. This Ideal Regulatory Framework essentially builds social credence into the scientific rationality approach. Social credence is built in by ensuring consumer information, trust and choice. The result is a trade diplomacy approach that contributes to regulatory stability and integration by balancing the competing interests within an operational, dynamic, rules-based approach capable of managing the social concerns associated with advanced technologies such as GM crops...|$|E

In Australia, these skills have been formalised as a set of national academic standards for science graduates that highlight essential skills in inquiry and problem solving. Such scientific thinking skills have been shown to be enhanced by inquiry-based curricula. However, within this curriculum, the extent of student learning gains depends on implementation and how student engage with class activities. We video recorded students undertaking inquiry classes to investigate how students engage with the curricula, and asked students to annotate their videos to highlight instances of scientific thinking, with specific reference to the Australian national academic standards for scientific thinking. Interviews through the semester elucidated the development of students’ critical thinking skills during the classes. This methodology allowed us to unpack which specific experiences within inquiry classes provide the most potent learning experiences and drive the maturation of students’ scientific thinking skills. In particular, when students need to integrate their novel or unexpected findings with the scientific literature, most are prompted to develop a more mature understanding of the contestable nature of scientific knowledge and the role of inquiry and experimentation in knowledge creation. This article reports on the places where student thinking appears to go awry, the indicators that signal that students have reached these <b>crucial</b> <b>crossroads,</b> and potential approaches to inquiry curriculum implementation to propel students toward a more mature, nuanced and critical way of interacting with their data and the primary scientific literature...|$|E

Proponents of the land reform have aggressively called for an expansion of the resettlement program to help redress the unequal distribution of land resources and to rectify acute land scarcity in communal areas. Opponents of rapid and substantial land reform have emphasized the superior efficiency of the commercial farming sector and the adverse consequences that a substantially expanded resettlement sector would have on agricultural output and the balance of trade. Many key questions {{lie at the heart of}} the land policy debate. First, what tenure arrangements might best serve farmers in the different sectors-communal, commercial, and resettlement-and how might they be instituted to provide equitable access, secure tenure, and flexibility in the face of changing economic conditions? Second, what legal framework ought to be instituted to facilitate the movement of land between farmers and enterprises within the system and what outcomes would be expected in terms of the distribution of agricultural landholdings among individuals and groups in society? Third, how would the process of land reform influence output, trade, and income distribution? Specifically, should land reform continue, and if so, what form should it take? What is the comparative efficiency of production in the commercial and communal sectors, and what gains or losses might be anticipated from resettlement? What legislative, institutional, and market reforms are needed to complement resettlement and to resolve the problems of land resource degradation in communal areas?

40|$|Kurdistan {{represents}} a crucial {{region in the}} Middle East for understanding patterns of human evolution {{in the use of}} food plants and especially wild vegetables as well as for assessing the influences of the major, surrounding bio-cultural macro-area. In this research, an ethnobotanical filed study focusing on wild vegetables traditionally gathered and consumed during the spring was conducted in a few villages of the Western Hawraman area, in South Kurdistan (Iraq), both among Sunni Muslims and Yarsanis (Ahl-e Haqq), the latter of which represent followers of a tiny, threatened, ancient monotheistic religion. Through interviews with 25 elderly informants, the folk uses of 34 botanical and mycological taxa were recorded. A few of the recorded species have never, or very rarely, been described in the ethnobotanical literature of the Middle East and for some of them (most notably Allium koelzii, Bongardia chrysogonum, Dorema aucheri, and Johrenia aromatica) their sensory chemistry and nutraceutical properties are largely unknown. No {{differences were found between the}} folk taxa mentioned by Sunni Muslims and those reported by Yarsanis. The high cultural value and consumption of raw young shoots of Imperata cylindrica should be further investigated considering the history of the development of agriculture in the area, as explanations for the domestication of wild grasses have never considered the hypothesis of gastronomic appreciation of their young aerial parts. Moreover, some of the most mentioned vegetables are also considered food-medicines. A comparison with all the pre-existing food ethnobotanical literature of the Middle East shows that the most culturally salient wild vegetables recorded in the Hawraman area are shared with Arabic, Turkish, Caucasian, and especially Persian food heritages. These findings suggest that investigating the ethnobiology of Kurdistan is more than ever urgent in order to document folk plant uses at a <b>crucial</b> <b>crossroad</b> of historical and cultural trajectories in the Middle East...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of plants, {{compared with that}} of animals, is largely post-embryonic and influenced much more by the environment, suggesting that the plants have evolved and distinct mechanisms to control plant development and growth. Cell division plays a vital role in plant development and growth. During the cell division, the G 1 -S transition is a <b>crucial</b> <b>crossroad</b> at the interface between cell proliferation and differentiation. By genetic, physiological, and molecular approaches, we demonstrate that Nicta;CYCA 3; 2 has important functions, analogous to those of cyclin E (an important regulator involved in G 1 -S transition) in animals, in the control of plant cell division and differentiation. Once S phase is initiated, DNA is replicated and chromatin is assembled. The establishment and maintenance of specific chromatin states provides an epigenetic mechanism for inheriting expression states throughout plant development. Our studies show that the tobacco SET domain protein NtSET 1 methylates H 3 K 9, which marks primarily heterochromatin. Ectopic expression of NtSET 1 increases the amount of H 3 K 9 dimethylation and induces chromosome segregation defects in tobacco BY 2 cells. Furthermore, NtSET 1 is shown to bind LHP 1, the only Arabidopsis homologue of animal heterochromatin protein 1. By immunolocalization and in vivo target analysis, it shows that both NtSET 1 -YFP and LHP 1 -YFP bind heterochromatic regions, suggesting a mechanism of function in heterochromatin formation. Study of Arabidopsis SET domain group gene SDG 8 reveals that SDG 8 encodes a major enzyme controlling methylation of H 3 K 36 in Arabidopsis, which positively regulates FLC transcription to prevent early flowering. In conclusion, my thesis work allows me to acquire a better understanding of plant development. The knowledge and techniques acquired in molecular and cellular biology will not only enable me to continue the research in plants but also adapt with the research on other organisms. ...|$|R

40|$|Earlier this term, the United States Supreme Court heard oral {{argument}} in the consolidated case of Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, {{the first of a}} litany of cases in which for-profit business entities are invoking the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (2 ̆ 2 RFRA 2 ̆ 2) in support of their claim that the Affordable Care Act’s HHS Mandate violates their freedom of religion. In particular, these plaintiffs argue that the Mandate’s requirement that employer-provided health insurance covers the costs of contraceptives, the 2 ̆ 2 morning after 2 ̆ 2 pill, and other fertility-related drugs conflicts with their deeply-held religious belief that life begins at conception and is, therefore, unconstitutional. While the Mandate does exempt 2 ̆ 2 religious employers 2 ̆ 2 from this requirement, it does not excuse all secular, for-profit corporations from complying simply because their officers, founders, or directors may have religious beliefs that conflict with the Mandate’s provisions. Authors Day and Diaz were sitting just feet away from the advocates during the riveting Hobby Lobby {{oral argument}}. One question by Justice Kennedy piqued their interest in the nondelegation doctrine and the principle of separation of powers as they apply to the HHS Mandate. In the first academic article authored during the crucial time between oral arguments and the Court’s decision, this paper breaks down the complex legal issues and provides a solid dose of 2 ̆ 2 common sense 2 ̆ 2 in analyzing what will ultimately be a decision with momentous and far-reaching consequences. First, this Article sets the stage for the Court’s forthcoming decision by providing some background and insight into the parties’ arguments, the history of free exercise jurisprudence, and RFRA, the centerpiece of Hobby Lobby’s claim. The Article poses critical and timely questions, such as whether this decision will reinstate or expand the pre-Smith standard for assessing religious exercise claims and whether Hobby Lobby, as a for-profit commercial business, has standing under RFRA to bring a free exercise claim. Second, this Article deconstructs the complexities of RFRA, providing a step-by-step analysis of its legal framework. It first provides a comprehensive overview of the dense 2 ̆ 2 substantial burden 2 ̆ 2 inquiry, which asks whether the government has imposed a substantial burden on the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs. Then, it outlines and analyzes the strict scrutiny standard, which RFRA applies. Next, the Article simplifies the complex and less widely-discussed nondelegation doctrine and addresses the dangerous trend spreading countrywide, in which states are enacting their own RFRA laws to exempt religious employers from complying with public accommodation laws. These exemptions essentially condone a new wave of discrimination, which give license to wedding vendors and other businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples or homosexual patrons. Lastly, the Article cautions that, in the wake of Hobby Lobby and the other RFRA cases, where the clash between religion, politics, and the law have met head-on, this Court must be cautious not to set a dangerous precedent and shield for-profit, secular businesses from liability when they fail to comply with public accommodation laws based on their asserted religious beliefs. Not only do we face a <b>crucial</b> <b>crossroad</b> in this Country’s free exercise jurisprudence, we also risk overlooking an impermissible delegation of legislative authority, which, when coupled with deference to administrative decision-making, threatens the constitutional structure and separation of powers.

2500|$|When the [...] "Army of the North" [...] {{attacked}} {{the forces of}} the Seventh Coalition in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, Kellermann, with Lhéritier's division was placed under the command of Marshal Michel Ney. On 16 June, Ney faced a massed Allied force at the Battle of Quatre Bras. Of Lhéritier's 11th cavalry division, only Guiton's cuirassier brigade was present and available for action. As Ney's situation became increasingly desperate, the Marshal ordered Kellermann to take his cuirassiers in a frontal charge against the enemy. The charge was very well handled and, despite the difficult terrain and the large numbers of the enemy, it did much to relieve the pressure on the French forces. At first, it broke Hugh Halkett's forces, then Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel's German infantry, eventually reaching the <b>crucial</b> Quatre Bras <b>crossroads.</b> However, this breakthrough could not be exploited, as no other units had been sent in immediate support of the heavy cavalry. The cuirassiers endured some murderous close-range musketry before finally turning and retreating at a trot, a manoeuvre during which Kellermann had his horse shot under him and barely escaped capture. Two days later, the entire III Corps was reunited under Kellermann's command and was available for action at the Battle of Waterloo. Lhéritier's division was committed towards 17:30, during the afternoon attacks, as Marshal Ney sent in his cavalry in mass against the Allied centre. A series of charges ensued, but such a cavalry attack, without proper infantry or artillery support was always set to fail on an uneven battlefield such as the one at Waterloo and against an infantry that {{had plenty of time to}} form protective squares. Despite the heroism and self-sacrifice of the French cavalry – Lhéritier's division alone lost six officers dead, three mortally wounded and forty wounded – the battle was lost. During this fateful day, Baron Lhéritier received a bullet wound to the right shoulder.|$|R
5000|$|Following Napoleon's abdication, General Lhéritier swore his {{allegiance}} to the Bourbon Restoration but from 1 June 1814 he was placed on half pay. Towards {{the end of the}} year, he was appointed Inspector General for cavalry in the 16th military division and took charge of this new function at the beginning of 1815. When Napoleon returned from exile and reclaimed power in France, Lhéritier rallied to his cause and was given a first field command on 23 April, namely the cavalry reserve of IV Army Corps. Then, on 3 June 1815, he was named commander of the 11th cavalry division, a mixed force composed of dragoons and cuirassiers. His direct subordinates were Brigadier General Cyrille Simon Picquet, in command of the 1st Brigade (2nd and 7th Dragoons) and none other than his former commander from 1806-1807 and 1809, Brigadier General Guiton, in command of the 2nd Brigade (8th and 11th Cuirassiers). The entire division was a part of François Etienne de Kellermann's III Cavalry Corps of the [...] "Army of the North".When the [...] "Army of the North" [...] attacked the forces of the Seventh Coalition in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, Kellermann, with Lhéritier's division was placed under the command of Marshal Michel Ney. On 16 June, Ney faced a massed Allied force at the Battle of Quatre Bras. Of Lhéritier's 11th cavalry division, only Guiton's cuirassier brigade was present and available for action. As Ney's situation became increasingly desperate, the Marshal ordered Kellermann to take his cuirassiers in a frontal charge against the enemy. The charge was very well handled and, despite the difficult terrain and the large numbers of the enemy, it did much to relieve the pressure on the French forces.
