The UK has a thriving carp angling market.

The new excavations continue to focus on the lithic and faunal assemblages, as well as human remains, but new approaches have also been incorporated into the project: micro-faunal fossil remains (essentially, rodents), the geological context of the [...] "Indusi karst", the geological formation of different layers of rock, palynology (the study of pollen), and <b>carpology</b> (the study of other plant remains), among other disciplines.|$|E

40|$|Pits are {{the most}} common archaeological {{features}} in late prehistoric Europe, yet their function and formation dynamics remain obscure. This paper draws on stratigraphy, contextual observations, and a novel analytical protocol to address such topics. The article presents an interdisciplinary and comparative post-excavation procedure to evaluate some of the most abundant items found in prehistoric pits, combining a taphonomical approach to the analysis of ceramics, charcoal, and <b>carpology.</b> This procedure provided new insights into the use-lives of a selection of five pits from an open-air site in Galicia (NW Iberia), which was occupied intermittently during the second millennium cal. BCE. An early use as silos is posited, and their final closure entailed cultural practices and preferences whose material fingerprint has been identified via multivariate analysis.

En este artículo presentamos las evidencias recuperadas en el yacimiento de San Adrian (Sierra de Aizkorri, Gipuzkoa), cuya excavación ha permitido reconstruir aspectos relativos a los modos de vida, la base económica, la cultura {{material}} y el contexto medioambiental de una serie de ocupaciones de la Edad del Bronce. Los resultados preliminares revelan la existencia de ocupaciones de hábitat periódicas y la explotación de recursos procedentes del Valle del Ebro y de la costa atlántica, contribuyendo a reconstruir los modos de vida y la circulación de bienes cotidianos en el norte de la península ibérica. Abstract: Bronze Age studies {{carried out}} in the Cantabrian Region have traditionally focused on prestige goods and funerary contexts.
