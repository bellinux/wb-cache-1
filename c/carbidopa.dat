5|$|Tolcapone {{inhibits}} {{the activity}} COMT, an enzyme which degrades dopamine. It {{has been used}} to complement levodopa; however, its usefulness is limited by possible complications such as liver damage. A similarly effective drug, entacapone, has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function. Licensed preparations of entacapone contain entacapone alone or in combination with <b>carbidopa</b> and levodopa.|$|E
5|$|Only 5–10% of {{levodopa}} {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier. Much {{of the remainder}} is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety of side effects including nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension. <b>Carbidopa</b> and benserazide are dopa decarboxylase inhibitors which do not cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, reducing side effects and improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One of these drugs is usually taken along with levodopa, often combined with levodopa in the same pill.|$|E
25|$|When {{combined}} with <b>carbidopa</b> (as {{a treatment for}} symptoms of Parkinson's disease), 5-HTP causes nausea and vomiting; however this can be alleviated via administration of granisetron. As mentioned below under pharmacology, cases of scleroderma-like illness {{have been reported in}} patients using <b>carbidopa</b> and 5-HTP.|$|E
25|$|Other {{studies have}} {{indicated}} {{the risk of a}} scleroderma-like condition resulting from the combination of 5-HTP and <b>carbidopa.</b>|$|E

25|$|Controlled, slow-release {{versions}} of Sinemet and Madopar {{spread out the}} effect of the levodopa. Duodopa is a combination of levodopa and <b>carbidopa.</b> Slow-release levodopa preparations have not shown an increased control of motor symptoms or motor complications when compared to immediate-release preparations.|$|E
25|$|Selegiline {{is used to}} {{help control}} the {{symptoms}} of Parkinson's disease in people who are taking levodopa and <b>carbidopa</b> combination (Sinemet). Selegiline may help people with PD by stopping the effects of levodopa/carbidopa from wearing off, and increasing {{the length of time}} levodopa/carbidopa continues to control symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the central}} nervous system, L-DOPA is also {{converted}} into dopamine from within the peripheral nervous system. Excessive peripheral dopamine signaling causes many of the adverse side effects seen with sole L-DOPA administration. To bypass these effects, it is standard clinical practice to coadminister (with L-DOPA) a peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI) such as <b>carbidopa</b> (medicines containing <b>carbidopa,</b> either alone or in combination with L-DOPA, are branded as Lodosyn (Aton Pharma) Sinemet (Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited), Pharmacopa (Jazz Pharmaceuticals), Atamet (UCB), and Stalevo (Orion Corporation) or with a benserazide (combination medicines are branded Madopar or Prolopa), to prevent the peripheral synthesis of dopamine from L-DOPA. Coadministration of pyridoxine without a DDCI accelerates the peripheral decarboxylation of L-DOPA {{to such an extent}} that it negates the effects of L-DOPA administration, a phenomenon that historically caused great confusion.|$|E
25|$|Tolcapone {{inhibits}} the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme, which degrades dopamine and levadopa, thereby prolonging {{the therapeutic}} effects of levodopa. It, alongside inhibitors of peripheral dopa decarboxylase, {{have been used}} to complement levodopa. However, due to its possible side effects such as liver failure, it is limited in its availability. A similar drug, entacapone, has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function and maintains adequate inhibition of COMT over time. Entacapone is available for treatment alone (COMTan) or combined with <b>carbidopa</b> and levodopa (Stalevo).|$|E
500|$|The {{most widely}} used {{treatment}} for parkinsonism is administration of L-DOPA, the metabolic precursor for dopamine. L-DOPA is converted to dopamine {{in the brain and}} various parts of the body by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase. [...] L-DOPA is used rather than dopamine itself because, unlike dopamine, it is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. It is often co-administered with an enzyme inhibitor of peripheral decarboxylation such as <b>carbidopa</b> or benserazide, to reduce the amount converted to dopamine in the periphery and thereby increase the amount of L-DOPA that enters the brain. [...] When L-DOPA is administered regularly over a long time period, a variety of unpleasant side effects such as dyskinesia often begin to appear; even so, it is considered the best available long-term treatment option for most cases of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{shows that}} co-administration with <b>carbidopa</b> greatly {{increases}} plasma 5-HTP levels. [...] However, {{several studies have}} reported that 5-HTP is effective even without a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g. <b>carbidopa).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Only 5–10% of L-DOPA {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier. The {{remainder}} is often metabolised to dopamine elsewhere, causing {{a wide variety}} of side effects including nausea, dyskinesias, and stiffness. <b>Carbidopa</b> and benserazide are [...] peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitors. They inhibit the metabolism of L-DOPA in the periphery, thereby increasing levodopa delivery to the central nervous system. They are generally given as combination preparations with levodopa. Existing preparations are carbidopa/levodopa (co-careldopa, trade names Sinemet, Pharmacopa, Atamet) and benserazide/levodopa (co-beneldopa, trade name Madopar). Levodopa has also been related to a dopamine dysregulation syndrome, which is a compulsive overuse of the medication, and punding.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbidopa</b> is {{also used}} in {{combination}} with 5-HTP, a naturally occurring amino acid which is a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin and an intermediate in tryptophan metabolism. <b>Carbidopa</b> prevents 5-HTP's {{metabolism in the liver}} and the resulting elevated levels of serotonin in the blood. Research shows that co-administration of 5-HTP and <b>carbidopa</b> greatly increases plasma 5-HTP levels. Several cases of scleroderma-like illness have been reported in patients using <b>carbidopa</b> and 5-HTP. In Europe, 5-HTP is prescribed with <b>carbidopa</b> to prevent the conversion of 5-HTP into serotonin until it reaches the brain.|$|E
50|$|When 5-HTP {{is used in}} medicine, it is {{generally}} administered along with <b>carbidopa,</b> which prevents the peripheral decarboxylation of 5-HTP to serotonin and so ensures that only brain serotonin levels are increased without producing peripheral side effects, however 5-HTP is also sold without <b>carbidopa</b> as a dietary supplement, and may have increased risks when taken by itself without <b>carbidopa.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{combined}} with <b>carbidopa</b> (as {{a treatment for}} symptoms of Parkinson's disease), 5-HTP causes nausea and vomiting; however this can be alleviated via administration of granisetron. As mentioned below under pharmacology, cases of scleroderma-like illness {{have been reported in}} patients using <b>carbidopa</b> and 5-HTP.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbidopa</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of, among other diseases, Parkinson's disease (PD), a condition characterized by death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Increased dopamine available may increase the effectiveness of the remaining neurons and alleviate symptoms for a time. The pharmacologic objective is to get an exogenous dopamine-precursor known as levodopa/L-DOPA into the dopamine-deficient brains of PD patients. Levodopa/L-DOPA can cross the blood-brain barrier, but dopamine cannot. The use of <b>carbidopa</b> seems counter-intuitive in Parkinson's disease (PD) in that it prevents DDC conversion of levodopa/L-DOPA to dopamine. However, exogenously provided, levadopa/L-DOPA gets metabolized peripherally to its active metabolite dopamine before reaching the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, the PD brain, which is deficient in dopamine, will not receive as much of its prodrug precursor levodopa/L-DOPA due to peripheral DDC breakdown. However, <b>carbidopa</b> can decrease peripheral DDC conversion of levodopa/L-DOPA before it crosses the blood-brain barrier. <b>Carbidopa</b> acts as a peripheral DDC inhibitor, as <b>carbidopa,</b> itself, cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. In other words, <b>carbidopa</b> has no effect on brain DDC conversion of levodopa/L-DOPA to dopamine. Ultimately, a greater proportion of the exogenously provided levodopa/L-DOPA reaches the brain. Commercially, carbidopa/levodopa combinations are available in {{the treatment}} of central dopamine deficiencies.|$|E
5000|$|Research {{shows that}} co-administration with <b>carbidopa</b> greatly {{increases}} plasma 5-HTP levels.

50|$|Examples of extracerebral decarboxylase inhibitors include <b>Carbidopa</b> and Benserazide.|$|E
50|$|Along with <b>carbidopa,</b> other DDC inhibitors are {{benserazide}} (Ro-4-4602), difluromethyldopa, and α-methyldopa.|$|E
50|$|Entacapone, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Comtan among others, is a {{medication}} commonly used {{in combination with other}} medications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Entacapone together with levodopa and <b>carbidopa</b> allows levodopa to have a longer effect in the brain and reduces Parkinson’s disease signs and symptoms for a greater length of time than levodopa and <b>carbidopa</b> therapy alone.|$|E
50|$|Levodopa is the {{immediate}} precursor to dopamine. Entacapone is a selective, reversible catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor {{that increases the}} bioavailability of levodopa. Entacapone does not cross the blood-brain barrier. <b>Carbidopa</b> is a peripheral aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor. <b>Carbidopa,</b> which also does not cross the blood-brain barrier, is combined with levodopa to prevent its conversion to dopamine in the periphery.|$|E

50|$|Carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone (Stalevo), a {{medication}} developed by Orion Pharma and marketed by Novartis, {{is a single}} tablet formulation that contains levodopa, <b>carbidopa,</b> and entacapone.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of carbidopa/levodopa carries the brand names of Kinson,Sinemet, Pharmacopa and Atamet; while Stalevo {{is a combination}} with entacapone, which enhances the bioavailability of <b>carbidopa</b> and levodopa.|$|E
50|$|SR {{deficiency}} {{is currently}} being treated using a combination therapy of levodopa and <b>carbidopa.</b> These treatments are also used for individuals suffering from Parkinson's. The treatment is noninvasive and only requires the patient to take oral tablets 3 or 4 times a day, where the dosage of levodopa and <b>carbidopa</b> {{is determined by the}} severity of the symptoms. Levodopa is in a class of medications called central nervous system agents where its main function is to become dopamine in the brain. <b>Carbidopa</b> is in a class of medications called decarboxylase inhibitors and it works by preventing levodopa from being broken down before it reaches the brain. This treatment is effective in mitigating motor symptoms, but it does not totally eradicate them and it is not as effective on cognitive problems. Patients who have been diagnosed with SR deficiency and have undergone this treatment have shown improvements with most motor impairments including oculogyric crises, dystonia, balance, and coordination.|$|E
50|$|While {{increase}} of dopamine levels is a desired interaction, tolcapone can theoretically {{also increase the}} levels of other drugs metabolised by COMT, such as the AADC inhibitors <b>carbidopa</b> and benzerazide, as well as methyldopa, dobutamine, apomorphine, adrenaline, and isoprenaline. In studies, a slight interaction with benzerazide was seen, but not with <b>carbidopa.</b> Other interactions with this group of drugs have not been studied. A related type of theoretical interactions is with drugs that increase catecholamine concentrations, such as monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors; these also showed only slight effects in practice. Combination with non-selective MAO inhibitors might be dangerous.|$|E
50|$|With L-DOPA {{identified}} as the active form, Alfred Pletscher {{and his colleagues at}} Hoffman-LaRoche synthesized benserazide, an inhibitor of DOPA decarboxylase, which further reduced the required dose. A drug combining L-DOPA with benserazide was marketed under the brand name of Madopar. Independent work was carried out by Victor Lotti at Merck in West Point, Pennsylvania. Merck had already synthesized and patented <b>carbidopa,</b> another dopa decarboxylase inhibitor in 1962, and in 1971 Lotti showed that the use of the L-form of <b>carbidopa,</b> further reduced the therapeutic dose of L-DOPA. The combination of L-carbidopa and L-DOPA was marketed under the brand name of Sinemet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbidopa</b> is most {{commonly}} used as a method to inhibit the activity of dopamine decarboxylase. This is an enzyme that breaks down L-Dopa in the periphery and converts it to dopamine. This results in the newly formed dopamine being unable to cross the blood-brain barrier {{and the effectiveness of}} L-Dopa treatments is greatly decreased. <b>Carbidopa</b> reduces the amount of levodopa required to produce a given response by about 75% and, when administered with levodopa, increases both plasma levels and the plasma half-life of levodopa, and decreases plasma and urinary dopamine and homovanillic acid. Elimination half-life of levodopa in the presence of <b>carbidopa</b> is about 1.5 hours. Following SINEMET CR, the apparent half-life of levodopa may be prolonged because of continuous absorption. This is extremely useful in the treatment of Parkinsons disease symptoms because the amount of levodopa administered to the patient can be greatly reduced. This reduction in dosage is extremely useful due to the side effects that may occur from an overdose of L-Dopa within the body.|$|E
50|$|Tolcapone {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of Parkinson's disease as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa or levodopa/benserazide medications. Levodopa is a prodrug for dopamine, which reduces Parkinson symptoms; <b>carbidopa</b> and benserazide are aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|Carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Stalevo, is an anti-parkinsonian dopaminergic {{combination}} medication that contains <b>carbidopa,</b> levodopa, and entacapone {{for the treatment of}} Parkinson's disease. It is marketed by Swiss-based Novartis Pharmaceuticals and manufactured by Finnish drugmaker Orion Corporation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbidopa,</b> an {{inhibitor}} of aromatic {{amino acid}} decarboxylation, is a white, crystalline compound, slightly soluble in water, with a molecular weight of 244.3. It is designated chemically as N-amino-α-methyl-3-hydroxy-L-tyrosine monohydrate. Its empirical formula is C10H14N2O4•H2O. Used {{in tandem with}} L-DOPA (also known as levodopa, a dopamine precursor converted in the body to dopamine), it increases the plasma half-life of levodopa from 50 minutes to 1½ hours. <b>CarbiDOPA</b> cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, so it inhibits only peripheral DDC. It thus prevents the conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine peripherally. This reduces the side effects caused by dopamine on the periphery, as well as increasing the concentration of L-DOPA and dopamine in the brain.|$|E
