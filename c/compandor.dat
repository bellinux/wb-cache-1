50|$|In the {{original}} system, {{as applied to}} 625 line analogue TV, the audio signal was sampled twice during each television line and each sample converted to 10-bit PCM. Two such samples were inserted into the next line synchronising pulse. At the destination, the audio samples were converted back to analogue form and the video waveform restored to normal. Compandors operating on the signal before encoding and after decoding enabled the required signal-to-noise ratio to be achieved. As the PCM noise was predominantly high-pitched, the <b>compandor</b> only needed to operate on the high frequencies. Also, the <b>compandor</b> only operated at high audio levels, so that modulation of the noise by the companding would be masked by the relatively loud high-frequency audio components. A pilot tone at half the sampling frequency was transmitted to enable the expander to track the gain adjustment applied by the compressor, even when the latter was limiting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} an exact and {{complete}} analysis of average design complexities of Lloyd-Max's scalar quantizers, scalar <b>compandors</b> and scalar quantizers designed using the hybrid model is carried out. The average design complexity depends on arithmetic complexity, memory complexity and implementation complexity. It is demonstrated {{that for a}} fixed number of quantizaton levels N, scalar <b>compandors</b> have the smallest and the Lloyd-Max's scalar quantizers have the largest complexity. Furthermore, it is shown that for a fixed number of quantizaton levels N the average design complexity of hybrid scalar quantizers is significantly smaller than the average design complexity of Lloyd-Max's scalar quantizers. Combining this result {{with the fact that}} the performances of hybrid scalar quantizers are almost equal to the optimal performances of Lloyd-Max's scalar quantizers, the usability of recently developed hybrid model is confirmed...|$|R

This involves linear electronic circuits as well as non-linear ones. The former are, for instance, passive filters, active filters, additive mixers, integrators and delay lines. Non-linear circuits include <b>compandors,</b> multiplicators (frequency mixers and voltage-controlled amplifiers), voltage-controlled filters, voltage-controlled oscillators and phase-locked loops.|$|R

Each channel has a full-wave rectifier to detect the average value of input signal, a linearized, temperaturecompensated variable gain cell (�G) and a dynamic time constant buffer. The buffer permits independent control of dynamic attack and recovery time with minimum external components and improved low frequency gain control ripple distortion over previous <b>compandors.</b> The SA 572 is intended for noise reduction in high-performance audio systems.

Coefficients {{on which we}} form approximative spline functions are determined by solving equation systems that are formed from treshold conditions. For Gaussian source at the input of the quantizer, using the obtained approximate spline functions a companding quantizer designing is done. On {{the basis of the}} comparison with the SQNR of the optimal <b>compandor</b> it can be noticed that the proposed companding quantizer based on approximate spline functions achieved SQNR arbitrary close to that of the optimal <b>compandor...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{constraints}} on the quantizer model are usually related to how complex the model can be designed and implemented. For the given bit rate, it is desirable to provide the highest possible signal to quantization noise ratio (SQNR) with reasonable complexity of a quantizer model. In {{order to avoid the}} influence of compressor function nonlinearity and the difficulties appearing in implementing and designing, especially in the Gaussian probability density function case, in this paper we linearize the optimal compressor function within the segments. We take advantage of piecewise linearization of the optimal compressor function, as a convenient solution for less complex designing compared to the asymptotically optimal <b>compandor,</b> and we provide performances close to the ones of the asymptotically optimal <b>compandor.</b> This makes our model useful in applications where the design and implementation complexity is a decisive factor. We propose a piecewise linear <b>compandor</b> (PLC) with an equal number of reproduction levels per nonuniformly spaced segments, where the segment thresholds are allotted to the equidistant optimal compressor function values. We study how the number of segments affects SQNR of the PLC. Features of the proposed PLC indicate its theoretical and practical significance in quantization of Gaussian source signals...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel coding {{algorithm}} based on loss compression using scalar quantization switching technique. The algorithm of switching is {{performed by the}} estimating input variance and further coding with Nonuniform Switched Scalar <b>Compandor</b> (NSSC). An accurate estimation of the input signal variance is needed when finding the best compressor function for a <b>compandor</b> implementation. It enables quantizers to be adapted to the maximal amplitudes of input signals. Additionally, we have discussed the performances of coding schemes designed according to waveform G. 711 and G. 712 standards and a novel presented codec standard for wideband speech and audio coding. We have pointed out the benefits {{that can be achieved}} by using our algorithm: raise of quality and compression. The main contribution of this model is reaching the loss compression through reaching the higher quality of the signal-to-quantization noise ratio (SQNR) {{in a wide range of}} signal volumes (variances) with respect to the necessary robustness over a broad range of input variances, and applying possibility for VOIP applications and an effective coding of signals that likewise speech signals follow Gaussian distribution and have the time varying characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes {{the novel}} model of scalar {{quantizer}} that combines two classical models, {{the model of}} scalar <b>compandor</b> and the model of Lloyd-Max’s scalar quantizer. Particularly, the proposed model utilizes {{the advantages of the}} both models while tending to minimize their deficiencies. The performance analysis of the novel quantizer is carried out assuming the Gaussian source of unit variance. It is demonstrated that with the novel model of quantizer near to the Lloyd-Max's optimal performances can be achieved. Moreover, we showed that for a fixed number of quantizaton levels, the average complexity of the novel quantizer is significantly smaller than that of the Lloyd-Max's scalar quantizer...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliography. Two new hybrid {{companding}} delta modulators for speech encoding {{are presented}} here. These modulators {{differ from the}} Hybrid Companding Delta Modulator (HCDM) proposed by Un et al in that the two new encoders employ Song Voice Adaptation {{as the basis of}} the instantaneous <b>compandor,</b> rather than Constant Factor adaptation. A detailed analysis of the performance, both objective and subjective, of these hybrid codecs has been carried out. Results show that overall the two codecs developed as part of this project are better than the HCDM codec. In addition the new codecs offer simpler implementation in digital hardware than the HCDM. A Computer Aided Test (CAT) system has been developed to simplify the design and test processes for speech codecs...|$|E
