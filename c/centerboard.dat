5|$|There {{are many}} {{memorials}} to Sanders, including {{an exhibit of}} photographs and his citations at Takapuna Primary School, which he attended, a bronze tablet in the church at Milford Haven, the home port of Prize, and The Sanders Memorial Scholarship at the University of Auckland for children {{of members of the}} Royal Navy or the Mercantile Marine. The best-known memorial is the Sanders Cup for interprovincial competition between 14-foot (4.3 m) <b>centerboard</b> X-class yachts, still contested to this day.|$|E
25|$|A {{lightning}} protection installation on a watercraft comprises a lightning protector {{mounted on the}} top of a mast or superstructure, and a grounding conductor in contact with the water. Electrical conductors attach to the protector and run down to the conductor. For a vessel with a conducting (iron or steel) hull, the grounding conductor is the hull. For a vessel with a non-conducting hull, the grounding conductor may be retractable, attached to the hull, or attached to a <b>centerboard.</b>|$|E
25|$|Capable of {{conducting}} multidisciplinary oceanographic operations {{in support of}} biological, chemical, and physical process studies, Oscar Dyson was commissioned as {{the first of a}} class of five of the most advanced fisheries research vessels in the world, with a unique capability to conduct both fishing and oceanographic research. She is a stern trawler with fishing capabilities similar to those of commercial fishing vessels. She is rigged for longlining and trap fishing and can conduct trawling operations to depths of 1,800 meters (5,905 feet). Her most advanced feature is the incorporation of acoustic quieting technology to enable NOAA scientists to monitor fish populations without the ships noise altering the behavior of the fish. Her oceanographic hydrophones are mounted on a retractable <b>centerboard,</b> or drop keel, that lowers scientific transducers away from the region of hull-generated flow noise, enhancing the quality of the data collected. To take full advantage of these advanced data-gathering capabilities, she has the Scientific Sonar System, which can accurately measure the biomass of fish in a survey area. She also has an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler with which to collect data on ocean currents and a multibeam sonar system that provides information on the content of the water column and on the type and topography of the seafloor while she is underway, and she can gather hydrographic data at any speed up to 11 knots (20km/hr).|$|E
30|$|Treatment HDC {{resulted}} in {{one pair of}} <b>centerboards</b> from each log, i.e., 96 boards in total. Treatment OPT {{resulted in}} 1458 board pairs for each log, i.e., 139, 968 boards in total.|$|R
50|$|The {{series are}} all small {{recreational}} keelboats, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. They have fractional sloop rigs, transom-hung rudders and retractable <b>centerboards.</b> They are normally fitted with an outboard motor for docking and maneuvering.|$|R
50|$|The Tangaroa Expedition of 2006 closely {{resembled the}} Kon-Tiki {{expedition}} sailing a balsa raft from Peru to Polynesia. Tangaroa outperformed Kon-Tiki by having an improved sail rig and by actively using guaras (<b>centerboards).</b> As such, the expedition represents a scientific continuation of Thor Heyerdahl's experiments in recreated maritime technology.|$|R
500|$|Born in Auckland, Sanders {{took up a}} {{seafaring}} {{career in}} 1899. He initially worked aboard steamships before transferring to sailing ships working around New Zealand waters to enhance his career prospects. After {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, he earned a master's certificate in late 1914. He then served in the Merchant Navy working aboard troopships until April 1916, when he was commissioned in the Royal Naval Reserve. He completed his military training in the United Kingdom after which he served aboard Helgoland, a Q-ship which operated against German submarines. [...] He performed well on his first two patrols and was given his own command, , in February 1917. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions while on his first patrol as captain, when Prize engaged and saw off a German U-boat that had earlier attacked and damaged his own ship. He was killed in action during Prizes fourth patrol when his ship was sunk by a U-boat. His Victoria Cross was presented to his father and is currently held by the Auckland War Memorial Museum. Several memorials exist to Sanders' memory, including the Sanders Cup, a sailing trophy for 14-foot (4.3 m) <b>centerboard</b> X-class yachts.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{advanced}} research vessels ever built, Sikuliaq has extensive scientific facilities. In addition to [...] of built-in laboratories, she can accommodate two to four 20-foot scientific containers on the [...] aft deck. In addition, Sikuliaq is fitted with flexible over-side handling equipment such as an A-frame in the stern {{as well as a}} number of science winches and cranes on the aft deck. She also has a retractable transducer <b>centerboard</b> (drop keel) for deploying various sensors under the vessel.|$|E
2500|$|Turnagain Arm and Knik Arm {{are known}} for large areas of silt. At low tide, {{much of this is}} exposed, making marine {{navigation}} difficult. Historically, ships and boats designed for the area had a relatively flat bottom with a modest <b>centerboard</b> and absence of a large keel because the boats would occasionally become beached at low tide either on purpose or by accident. [...] This design allowed the craft to support its weight on land without sustaining any serious damage to its structure. [...] An example of this design is the Nomad, a much photographed fishing boat once owned by Joe Reddington which has sat on a mudflat near Knik for several decades.|$|E
50|$|Heyerdahl's grandson, Olav Heyerdahl, retraced his grandfather's Kon-Tiki voyage in 2006 {{as part of}} a six-member crew. The voyage, {{organized}} by Torgeir Higraff and called the Tangaroa Expedition, was intended as a tribute to Heyerdahl, an effort to better understand navigation via <b>centerboards</b> ("guara") as well as a means to monitor the Pacific Ocean's environment.|$|R
50|$|The {{schooner}} rig {{dominated the}} lumber trade, since its fore-and-aft rigging permitted sailing {{closer to the}} wind, easier entry to small ports, and smaller crews than square-rigged vessels. These ships needed {{to return to the}} lumber ports without the expense of loading ballast. Shipyards built some smaller schooners with <b>centerboards</b> that retracted. This helped the flat-bottomed vessels to enter shallow water.|$|R
50|$|Sharpies are {{a type of}} hard chined {{sailboat}} with a flat bottom, extremely shallow draft, centreboards and straight, flaring sides. They {{are believed}} to have originated in the New Haven, Connecticut region of Long Island Sound, United States. They were traditional fishing boats used for oystering, and later appeared in other areas. With <b>centerboards</b> and shallow balanced rudders they are well suited to sailing in shallow tidal waters.|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to the incompetent Canadian challenges, the [...] in 1881 to require that challenges be accepted only from yacht clubs on the sea and that challenger yachts must sail to the venue on their own hull. Furthermore, Archibald Cary Smith and the NYYC committee devised a new rating rule that would govern the next races. They included sail area and waterline length into the handicap, with penalties on waterlines longer than [...] Irish yacht designer John Beavor-Webb launched the challengers Genesta (1884) and Galatea (1885), which would define the British [...] "plank-on-edge" [...] design of a heavy, deep and narrow-keel hull, making for very stiff yachts ideal for the British breeze. The boats came to New York in 1885 and 1886 respectively, but neither would best the sloops Puritan or Mayflower, whose success in selection trials against many other candidates proved Boston designer Edward Burgess was {{the master of the}} [...] "compromise sloop" [...] (lightweight, wide and shallow hull with <b>centerboard).</b> This design paradigm proved ideal for the light Yankee airs.|$|E
2500|$|LAMP {{has also}} {{excavated}} two historically significant 19th century wrecks: a wooden-hulled steamship, and a <b>centerboard</b> schooner. [...] The identities of both wrecks remain unknown, but {{the study of}} their remains {{has led to a}} greater understanding of the economic and technological evolution of St. Augustine at the dawn of modernity. [...] The latter shipwreck carried a cargo of cement in barrels which was probably intended for the city's late 19th century building boom, associated with industrialist entrepreneur Henry Flagler. [...] In addition to these and other shipwrecks, LAMP has investigated a wide variety of archaeological sites in St. Augustine and the greater Florida First Coast region representing Florida's French, Spanish, British, and Early American periods. [...] These include British plantation landings, community boatyard foundations, ferry and steamboat landings, ballast dump sites, colonial wharves, and inundated terrestrial sites. Current work includes the implementation of the First Coast Maritime Archaeology Project, a comprehensive program of research and outreach focusing on the waters around St. Augustine and elsewhere in northeast Florida. [...] This project was partially funded from 2007-2009 and 2014-2019 by historic preservation grants awarded by the state of Florida.|$|E
2500|$|Racing {{dinghies}} {{are designed}} for racing, [...] but not all have necessarily the same calibre of performance as the above. [...] However, {{in many cases they}} can still offer equally close competition, [...] at the very highest standards, [...] which for many racing helmsmen and crews is the most important consideration. [...] They cover a wide range, and many are descended from Uffa Fox's seminal International 14. People often [...] "travel" [...] with their dinghies to international races in famous sailing spots such as Lake Garda in Italy. [...] The Snipe International Class still stands as one of the strongest classes, after reaching the status of world's largest fleet of dinghies in July 1936. [...] Other examples include the GP14, Enterprise, Solo, Graduate, Firefly, Lark. [...] A specialized subgroup is the Scow, which typically uses two bilgeboards instead of a <b>centerboard,</b> and may have two rudders. Many racing dinghies require two or more people to sail the boat, the skipper is in charge or steering and the main sail depending on the boat, and the crew {{is in charge of the}} jib, the spinnaker,(which can only be flown while going downwind) and keeping the boat level ...|$|E
50|$|Torgeir Sæverud Higraff is an explorer, {{teacher and}} author with special {{interest}} in prehistoric transoceanic contact. Like Thor Heyerdahl, Higraff combines history, anthropology and traditional knowledge with expeditions. In 2002, the year Heyerdahl died, Higraff decided to recreate the Kon-Tiki expedition, and in 2006 the Tangaroa Expedition sailed from Peru to Raiatea in eastern Polynesia. Tangaroa outperformed Kon-Tiki by using an improved sail rig and active use of the guara <b>centerboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sharpie style hulls {{that are}} {{developed}} in New Zealand {{are made of}} plywood, use water ballast in underseat tanks that empty when trailered, vertical (dagger) ballasted boards (about 80-100 lbs) type <b>centerboards</b> (hoisted with a simple 4:1 block arrangement led back to the cockpit) and are commonly about 20-24 feet LOA. They are not traditionally rigged, instead having conventional fractional sloop rigs. They went through {{a brief period of}} popularity in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|R
30|$|For this study, only logs {{with a top}} {{diameter}} of 156 – 167  mm were used. This corresponds {{to one of the}} sawing classes in the industrial case study described by Broman et al. [21], where two <b>centerboards</b> of dimensions 50  ×  100  mm nominal dimensions were sawn. In the study at hand, the same sawing pattern was used. 47 logs from the stem bank fell into the top diameter interval 156 – 167  mm, and these were subsequently used for this study.|$|R

50|$|Lateral {{force is}} a {{reaction}} {{supplied by the}} underwater shape of a sailboat, the blades of an ice boat and the wheels of a land sailing craft. Sailboats rely on keels, <b>centerboards,</b> and other underwater foils, including rudders, that provide lift in the lateral direction, to provide hydrodynamic lateral force (PLAT) to offset the lateral force component acting on the sail (FLAT) and minimize leeway. Such foils provide hydrodynamic lift and, for keels, ballast to offset heeling. They incorporate {{a wide variety of}} design considerations.|$|R
5000|$|The boat's {{design was}} {{considered}} revolutionary {{at that time}} by bringing aspects of racing design into open ocean cruising yachts which up to then meant heavy and slow traditional boats. The Valiant 40 is credited with birthing the category of the [...] "performance cruiser". It was the first oceangoing cruising monohull to have a modified keel designed to reduce weight and wetted surface while increasing speed and ease of propulsion of the hull shape by the wind. At least three Valiant 40s were built with <b>centerboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Leeboards and <b>centerboards,</b> used to {{stabilize}} the junk and to improve its capability to sail upwind, are documented from a 759 AD book by Li Chuan. The innovation was adopted by Portuguese and Dutch ships around 1570. Junks often employ a daggerboard that is forward on the hull which allows the center section of the hull {{to be free of}} the daggerboard trunk allowing larger cargo compartments. Because the daggerboard is located so far forward, the junk must use a balanced rudder to counteract the imbalance of lateral resistance.|$|R

50|$|Tangaroa's six-man {{crew was}} led by Norwegian Torgeir Higraff and {{included}} Olav Heyerdahl, grandson of Thor Heyerdahl, Bjarne Krekvik (captain), Øyvin Lauten (executive officer), Swedish Anders Berg (photographer) and Peruvian Roberto Sala. Tangaroa was launched {{on the same day}} that Kon-Tiki had been—April 28—and it reached its destination on July 7, which was 30 days faster than Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki which had taken 101 days for the voyage. Tangaroa's speed was credited to the proper use of the quara <b>centerboards</b> in navigation. Heyerdahl had not known how to correctly use them.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, the Tangaroa Expedition recreated the Kon-Tiki voyage using a {{newly built}} raft, the Tangaroa, {{named after the}} Māori sea-god Tangaroa.

2500|$|Munroe, however, was {{a talented}} boat {{designer}} {{who was able}} to work around the problems with the drawings. [...] His adaptations can be seen in successive proas. [...] Rather than the deep, asymmetric hull of a traditional proa, Munroe created flat-bottomed hulls (similar to the fisolera referred to by Pigafetta), with keels or <b>centerboards</b> for lateral resistance. [...] His first iteration had an iron center fin with a half-oval profile. [...] Rather than the traditional crab-claw sail's spars which meet at the front, Munroe's sails used what could be described as a triangular lug sail or spritsail with a boom, similar to the modern lateen sail with a shorter upper spar.|$|R

This was a pleasure that would lose nothing by being deferred; they were satisfied to sit still in the warm cabin and gloat over their success.|$|E
50|$|The Tancook Schooner, {{with its}} counter stern and {{characteristic}} round or 'spoon' bow was a distinctive type of small sailing work boat built primarily on Big Tancook Island, Nova Scotia and the immediate surrounding area on and near Mahone Bay. The design succeeded the earlier double ended Tancook Whaler fishing boats. The Tancook Schooners were usually {{larger than the}} Tancook Whalers and had fixed keels rather than <b>centerboards.</b> The sail plan for the smaller sizes of transom sterned schooners was typically gaff rigged fore and main and one or sometimes two headsails. After about 1930, marconi mains were common {{and a number of}} the smaller schooners were rigged as knockabouts flying a single jib without a bowsprit keeping the head sail rigging on deck.|$|R
5000|$|Navigation. Pre-Columbian rafts were steered by a {{combination}} of adjusting the sails and the use of <b>centerboards,</b> called [...] "guaras." [...] These were boards typically about 60 cm wide inserted vertically into the sea between the balsa logs. On larger rafts there were three sets of the guaras at the front, back, and the middle of the raft. Raising, lowering, or removing some of the guaras or moving them toward the bow or stern reduced or increased sub-surface tension and made it possible to steer the raft. Working in tandem with the sails, the guaras, according to an 1820 report, permitted the crew to undertake [...] "all the maneuvers of a regularly built and well-rigged sailing vessel." [...] The rafts could achieve a speed of 4 to 5 knots.|$|R
50|$|During a death roll, {{the boat}} rolls {{from side to}} side, {{becoming}} gradually more unstable until either it capsizes or the skipper reacts correctly to prevent it. While on the dead run, off the wind, the force exerted by the sail lies almost parallel to the center line of the boat. There {{is little or no}} force causing the boat to heel to leeward, unlike most other points of sailing, and, if the sail is out past perpendicular to the center line, or the sail is incorrectly shaped, there may be a force causing the boat to heel to windward. Instabilities in the wind, and turbulence caused by the sail, which 'fouls' the wind on such a tack, may cause this force to change rapidly. Most sailors also retract the <b>centerboards</b> of their dinghies while on the run, to reduce drag and increase speed. The lack of resistance to the rolling motion can enhance it.|$|R
