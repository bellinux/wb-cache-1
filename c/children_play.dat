Deaf infants and children with hearing problems due to infections are usually delayed in the beginning of vocal babbling.|$|E

25|$|Stop {{signs are}} often used in North America to control {{conflicting}} traffic movements at intersections that are not busy enough to justify the installation of a traffic signal or roundabout. In the United States, the stop sign is not intended {{for use as a}} traffic calming device; it is intended to be installed mainly for safety and/or to assign right-of-way for a certain direction. Nevertheless, in the United States, Mexico and Canada, stop signs are commonly deployed as supposed safety measures in residential areas and near places where <b>children</b> <b>play</b> or walk (such as schoolyards), or that experience frequent automobile collisions, making extra precautions necessary. Stop signs may be erected on all intersecting roads, resulting in three- and four-way stops.

Teachers report a relative ease in holding students accountable to their stated plans.

40|$|The thesis {{entitled}} The Role of Preschool Teacher in Child Structured and Unstructured Play {{focuses on}} play, play {{materials and the}} role of preschool teacher in the preschool period. The theoretical part focuses on the meaning of <b>childâ€™s</b> <b>play</b> and play materials as well as the role of the preschool professionals. Various types, factors and characteristics of <b>childâ€™s</b> <b>play</b> were presented and play materials were defined. Toy quality criteria are also briefly described. The chapter dealing with the play and curriculum contains a detailed study on the meaning of <b>child's</b> <b>play</b> in connection with individual areas of the activity. The theoretical part ends with the important role of preschool teacher in organizing and preparing preschool <b>child's</b> <b>play.</b> The mail goal of the empirical part was an insight into the preschool teachers' point of view on structured and unstructured materials. I wanted to find out how well nursery schools are stocked with such materials, possible problems in organizing <b>childâ€™s</b> <b>play</b> using the abovementioned materials and how often the material is used in <b>childâ€™s</b> <b>play.</b> The focus was put on the meaning of structured and unstructured materials as a means of motivation in childâ€™s play; the child's response and perseverance using a specific type of play material as well as opinion on the meaning and quality of preschool teacher's role in <b>childâ€™s</b> <b>play</b> organization and preparation using child structured and unstructured materials. Based on the research results it was established that nursery schools are well stocked with structured and unstructured materials and that structured material is still mostly used by preschool teachers in organizing the <b>childâ€™s</b> <b>play.</b> I also found out that visually and technically perfected toys do not necessarily mean successful <b>childâ€™s</b> <b>play</b> and development. According to preschool teachers, preschool children prefer unstructured materials, which increase the child's motivation and imagination in different child ages. Preschool teachers often join the <b>child</b> structured material <b>play</b> indirectly acting as a judge, guide and initiator in order to resolve the conflicts. Preschool teaches warn that their role in planning <b>childâ€™s</b> <b>play</b> with structured and unstructured materials is demanding and difficult.
