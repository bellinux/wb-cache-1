40|$|In recent years, much {{progress}} has been made with respect to the unravelling of the functions of peroxisomes in metabolism, and it is now well established that peroxisomes are indispensable organelles, especially in higher eukaryotes. Peroxisomes catalyse a number of essential metabolic functions including fatty acid beta-oxidation, ether phospholipid biosynthesis, fatty acid alpha-oxidation and glyoxylate detoxification.

Although brain damage is the predominant pathophysiological complication of cerebral malaria (CM), respiratory distress, acute lung injury, hydrothorax/pleural effusion are also observed in several cases. Immunological parameters have been assessed in pleural fluid in murine models; however {{there are no}} reports of <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> present in pleural effusion. Methods 1 H NMR of the sera and the pleural effusion of cerebral malaria infected mice were analyzed using principal component analysis, orthogonal partial least square analysis, multiway principal component analysis, and multivariate curve resolution. Results It has been observed that there was 100 % occurrence of pleural effusion (PE) in the mice affected with CM, {{as opposed to those}} are non-cerebral and succumbing to hyperparasitaemia (NCM/HP). An analysis of 1 H NMR and SDS-PAGE profile of PE and serum samples of each of the CM mice exhibited a similar profile in terms of constituents. Multivariate analysis on these two classes of biofluids was performed and significant differences were detected in concentrations of metabolites. Glucose, creatine and glutamine contents were high in the PE and lipids being high in the sera. Multivariate curve resolution between sera and pleural effusion showed that changes in PE co-varied with that of serum in CM mice. The increase of glucose in PE is negatively correlated to the glucose in serum in CM as obtained from the result of multiway principal component analysis. Conclusions This study reports for the first time, the <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> in pleural effusion formed during murine cerebral malaria. The study indicates that the origin of PE metabolites in murine CM may be the serum. The loss of the components like glucose, glutamine and creatine into the PE may worsen the situation of patients, in conjunction with the enhanced glycolysis, glutaminolysis and increased activity of creatine phophokinase which are already reported characteristic pathophysiological features of malaria. </p...|$|E

However, it is of major interest to supplement this with a functional analysis of the microbiota. In this review, the different approaches that have been used to characterize microbial metabolites, yielding information on the functional end products of microbial metabolism, have been summarized. To analyze colonic microbial metabolites, the most conventional way is by application of a hypothesis-driven targeted approach, through quantification <b>of</b> selected <b>metabolites</b> from carbohydrate (e. g., short-chain fatty acids) and protein fermentation (e. g., p-cresol, phenol, ammonia, or H(2) S), secondary bile acids, or colonic enzymes.

Furthermore, the developed approach is exemplified with nine unknown biochemical compounds contained in F. graminearum samples derived from an untargeted metabolomics experiment. The mass difference between the corresponding fragment ions present in the MS/MS spectra of the native and U- 13 C-labeled compound enabled the assignment of the number of carbon atoms to each fragment signal and allowed the generation of meaningful putative molecular formulas for each fragment ion, which in turn also helped determine the elemental composition of the precursor ion.

Successive cycles of dental plaque growth and calcification {{make it an}} unusually wellpreserved, long-term record of host-microbial interaction in the archaeological record. Recent studies have confirmed the survival of authentic ancient DNA and proteins within historic and prehistoric dental calculus, making it a promising substrate for investigating oral microbiome evolution via direct measurement and comparison of modern and ancient specimens. Objective We present the first comprehensive characterization of the human dental calculus metabolome using a multi-platform approach. Methods Ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) quantified 285 metabolites in modern and historic (200 years old) dental calculus, including metabolites of drug and dietary origin. A subset of historic samples was additionally analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography–MS (GC–MS) and UPLC–MS/MS for further <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> and lipids. Metabolite profiles of modern and historic calculus were compared to identify patterns of persistence and loss. Results Dipeptides, free amino acids, free nucleotides, and carbohydrates substantially decrease in abundance and ubiquity in archaeological samples, with some exceptions. Lipids generally persist, and saturated and mono-unsaturated medium and long chain fatty acids appear to be well-preserved, while metabolic derivatives related to oxidation and chemical degradation are found at higher levels in archaeological dental calculus than fresh samples.

In the present study, the <b>metabolite</b> profiling <b>of</b> grapes from the cultivars, Alvarinho, Arinto and Padeiro de Basto, of two Portuguese Controlled Denomination of Origin (DOC) regions (Vinho Verde and Lisboa) was investigated by gas chromatography-coupled time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) and an amino acid analyzer. Primary metabolites, including sugars, organic acids and amino acids, and some secondary metabolites were identified. Tartaric and malic acids and free amino acids accumulated more in grapes from vines of the DOC region of Vinho Verde than DOC Lisboa, but a principal component analysis (PCA) plot showed that besides the DOC region, the grape cultivar also accounted for {{the variance in the}} relative abundance <b>of</b> <b>metabolites.</b> Grapes from the cultivar, Alvarinho, were particularly rich in malic acid and tartaric acids in both DOC regions, but sucrose accumulated more in the DOC region of Vinho Verde...|$|R
40|$|Sponge (Piorifera) are primitive,filter-feeding organisms, {{which is}} single best {{resources}} of marine natural products to-date. About 40 - 70 % of sponge biomass is constituted of microorganism {{with many of}} them playing important roles in the biosynthesis <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> isolated from marine sponges.
