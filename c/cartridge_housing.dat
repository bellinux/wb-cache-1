5000|$|Muntz's {{cartridge}} {{had used}} {{two pairs of}} stereo tracks in the same configuration as then-current [...] "quarter track" [...] reel-to-reel tapes. This format was intended to parallel his source material, which was usually a single LP (long playing) record with two sides. Program switching was achieved by physically moving the head up and down mechanically by a lever. The Stereo 8 version doubled the amount of programming on the tape by providing eight total tracks, usually comprising four programs of two tracks each. Lear touted this as a great improvement, because much more music could be held inside a standard <b>cartridge</b> <b>housing,</b> but in practice {{this resulted in a}} slight loss of sound quality and an increase in background noise from the narrower tape tracks. Unlike the Stereo-Pak, the Stereo 8 could switch between tracks automatically, {{with the use of a}} small length of conductive foil at the splice joint on the tape, which would cause the player to change tracks as it passed the head assembly.|$|E

50|$|The Family Computer (or Famicom), the Japanese {{version of}} the NES, utilize a 60-pin {{cartridge}} design. This yields smaller cartridges than the NES, which utilizes a 72-pin design. Four pins are used for the 10NES lockout chip. Ten pins were added that connect a cartridge directly to the expansion port {{on the bottom of}} the unit. Finally, two pins that allow cartridges to provide their own sound expansion chips were removed. Some early NES <b>cartridges</b> <b>housed</b> the same printed circuit boards as their Famicom counterparts, using a converter (such as the T89 Cartridge Converter) to allow them to fit inside the internally compatible NES hardware.

40|$|The {{function}} of cartridge filter is to separate substance or particle from liquid. Cartridge filter is a media to filtrate substance that flow with liquid. Cartridge filter {{in this project}} focus for water filtration system that usually used at houses and small scale industry. Volume flow rate relate with pressure of the water that flow through pipe system. Cartridge filter function as a media that reduced pressure from the water flow and call pressure drop. Sediment sand particles function as particles that flow with the water and will filtrate with cartridge filter. Sediment sand make contact {{on the surface of}} cartridge filter depend on the volume flow rate of water. Cartridge will clogged because of sediment sand clog on the surface of cartridge filter when tried to enter the cartridge filter. This situation make filtration system has different pressure on the entrance and the exit of <b>cartridge</b> <b>housing.</b> Different pressure call pressure drop represent the pressure drop of the cartridge. From the pressure drop can relate with volume flow rate and determined life span and maximum condition of the cartridge filter.

40|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of cells from urine provides a convenient approach to non-invasive detection of bladder cancer. The practical use of urinary cell-based tests is often hampered by difficulties in handling and analyzing large sample volumes, {{the need for}} rapid sample processing to avoid degradation of cellular content, and low sensitivity due to a high background of normal cells. We present a filtration device, designed for home or point-of-care use, which enables collection, storage and shipment of urinary cells. A special feature of this device is a removable <b>cartridge</b> <b>housing</b> a membrane filter, which after filtration of urine can be transferred to a storage unit containing an appropriate preserving solution. In spiking experiments, {{the use of this}} device provided efficient recovery of bladder cancer cells with elimination of > 99 % of excess smaller-sized cells. The performance of the device was further evaluated by DNA-based {{analysis of}} urinary cells collected from 57 patients subjected to transurethral resection following flexible cystoscopy indicating the presence of a tumor. All samples were tested for FGFR 3 mutations and seven DNA methylation markers (BCL 2, CCNA 1, EOMES, HOXA 9, POU 4 F 2, SALL 3 and VIM). In the group of patients where a transitional cell tumor was confirmed at histopathological evaluation, urine DNA was positive for one or more markers in 29 out of 31 cases (94 %), including 19 with FGFR 3 mutation (61 %). In the group of patients with benign histopathology, urine DNA was positive for methylation markers in 13 out of 26 cases (50 %). Only one patient in this group was positive for a FGFR 3 mutation. This patient had a stage Ta tumor resected 6 months later.

50|$|Early {{engine oil}} filters were of {{cartridge}} (or replaceable element) construction, {{in which a}} permanent housing contains a replaceable filter element or <b>cartridge.</b> The <b>housing</b> is mounted either directly on the engine or remotely with supply and return pipes connecting it to the engine. In the mid-1950s, the spin-on oil filter design was introduced: a self-contained housing and element assembly {{which was to be}} unscrewed from its mount, discarded, and replaced with a new one. This made filter changes more convenient and potentially less messy, and quickly came to be the dominant type of oil filter installed by the world's automakers. Conversion kits were offered for vehicles originally equipped with cartridge-type filters. In the 1990s, European and Asian automakers in particular began to shift back in favor of replaceable-element filter construction, because it generates less waste with each filter change. American automakers have likewise begun to shift to replaceable-cartridge filters, and retrofit kits to convert from spin-on to cartridge-type filters are offered for popular applications. Commercially available automotive oil filters vary in their design, materials, and construction details. Ones that are made from completely synthetic material excepting the metal drain cylinders contained within are far superior and longer lasting than the traditional cardboard/cellulose/paper type that still predominate. These variables affect the efficacy, durability, and cost of the filter.|$|R
40|$|A {{novel and}} {{disposable}} cartridge for chemiluminescent (CL) -lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) with integrated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) photosensors array {{was developed and}} applied to quantitatively detect human serum albumin (HSA) in urine samples. The presented analytical method {{is based on an}} indirect competitive immunoassay using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a tracer, which is detected by adding the luminol/enhancer/hydrogen peroxide CL cocktail. The system comprises an array of a-Si:H photosensors deposited on a glass substrate, on which a PDMS <b>cartridge</b> that <b>houses</b> the LFIA strip and the reagents necessary for the CL immunoassay was optically coupled to obtain an integrated analytical device controlled by a portable read-out electronics. The method is simple and fast with a detection limit of 2. 5 mg L− 1 for HSA in urine and a dynamic range up to 850 mg L− 1, which is suitable for measuring physiological levels of HSA in urine samples and their variation in different diseases (micro- and macroalbuminuria). The use of CL detection allowed accurate and objective analyte quantification in a dynamic range that extends from femtomoles to picomoles. The analytical performances of this integrated device were found to be comparable with those obtained using a charge-coupled device (CCD) as a reference off-chip detector. These results demonstrate that integrating the a-Si:H photosensors array with CL-LFIA technique provides compact, sensitive and low-cost systems for CL-based bioassays {{with a wide range of}} applications for in-field and point-of-care bioanalyses...|$|R
40|$|Early and {{accurate}} disease diagnosis still remains {{a major challenge}} in clinical settings. Biomarkers could potentially provide useful tools for the detection and monitoring of disease progression, treatment safety and efficacy. Recent years have witnessed prodigious advancement in biosensor development with research directed towards rapid, real-time, label-free and sensitive biomarker detection. Among emerging techniques, nanoplasmonic biosensors pose tremendous potential to accelerate clinical diagnosis with real-time multiplexed analysis, rapid and miniaturized assays, low sample consumption and high sensitivity. In order to translate these technologies from the proof-of-principle concept level to point of care clinical diagnosis, integrated, portable devices having small footprint <b>cartridges</b> that <b>house</b> low-cost disposable consumables are sought. Towards this goal, we developed an all-polymeric nanoplasmonic microfluidic (NMF) transmission surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. The device was fabricated in thermoplastics using a simple, single step and cost-effective hot embossing technique amenable to mass production. The novel 3 D hierarchical mold fabrication process enabled monolithic integration of blazed nanogratings within the detection chambers of a multichannel microfluidic system. Consequently, a single hard thermoplastic bottom substrate comprising plasmonic and fluidic features allowed integration of active fluidic elements, such as pneumatic valves, in the top soft thermoplastic cover, increasing device functionality. A simple and compact transmission-based optical setup was employed with multiplexed end-point or dual-channel kinetic detection capability which did not require stringent angular accuracy. The sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of the transmission SPR biosensor was demonstrated through label-free immunodetection of soluble cell-surface glycoprotein sCD 44 at clinically relevant picomolar to nanomolar concentrations.

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{conducted}} {{an evaluation of}} two high efficiency steel filters in the exhaust of an uranium oxide grit blaster at the Y- 12 Plant in Oak Ridge Tennessee. The filters were installed in a specially designed filter housing with a reverse air-pulse cleaning system for automatically cleaning the filters in-place. Previous tests conducted on the same filters and housing at LLNL under controlled conditions using Arizona road dust showed good cleanability with reverse air pulses. Two high efficiency steel filters, containing 64 pleated <b>cartridge</b> elements <b>housed</b> in the standard 2 {prime} x 2 {prime} {times} l{prime} HEPA frame, were evaluated in the filter test housing using a 1, 000 cfm slip stream containing {{a high concentration of}} depleted uranium oxide dust. One filter had the pleated cartridges manufactured to the authors specifications by the Pall Corporation and the other by Memtec Corporation. Test results showed both filters had a rapid increase in pressure drop with time, and reverse air pulses could not decrease the pressure drop. The authors suspected moisture accumulation in the filters was the problem since there were heavy rains during the evaluations, and the pressure drop of the Memtec filter decreased dramatically after passing clean, dry air through the filter and after the filter sat idle for one week. Subsequent laboratory tests on a single filter cartridge confirmed that water accumulation in the filter was responsible for the increase in filter pressure drop and the inability to lower the pressure drop by reverse air pulses. No effort was made to identify the source of the water accumulation and correct the problem because the available funds were exhausted...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} the characteristics {{and performance of}} a camera system, Spectral energy distribution Camera for Quasars in Early Universe (SQUEAN). It was developed to measure SEDs of high redshift quasar candidates (z ≳ 5) and other targets, e. g., young stellar objects, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts, and to trace the time variability of SEDs of objects such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). SQUEAN consists of an on-axis focal plane camera module, an auto-guiding system, and mechanical supporting structures. The science camera module is composed of a focal reducer, a customizable filter wheel, and a CCD camera on the focal plane. The filter wheel uses filter <b>cartridges</b> that can <b>house</b> filters with different shapes and sizes, enabling the filter wheel to hold twenty filters of 50 mm × 50 mm size, ten filters of 86 mm × 86 mm size, or many other combinations. The initial filter mask was applied to calibrate the filter wheel with high accuracy and we verified that the filter position is repeatable at much less than one pixel accuracy. We installed and tested 50 nm medium bandwidth filters of 600 [...] 1, 050 nm and other filters at the commissioning observation in 2015 February.
