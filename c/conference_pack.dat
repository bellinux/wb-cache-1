40|$|BACKGROUND: Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) {{is often}} undetected until complications arise, despite {{it being a}} major healthcare burden and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular death and systemic atherosclerosis. Appropriate diagnostic tools {{are as important as}} clinical knowledge and skill to investigate patients for PAD. Currently, the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) is the recommended diagnostic tool for PAD. PURPOSE: We explore current opinions on ABPI by general practitioners (GPs) and the limitations to its implementation in primary care practice. METHODS: GPs attending a regional 1 -day study event, were surveyed in October 2014. Survey questionnaires were placed at the top of each <b>conference</b> <b>pack</b> for each attendee. The survey questionnaire was modelled from the ankle-brachial index (ABI) usage survey questionnaire used in the PAD Awareness, Risk and Treatment: New Resources for Survival (PARTNERS) preceptorship study. RESULTS: All respondents were GPs, with a survey response rate of 77. 1 %. All respondents regarded ABPI as an important test, that is primarily performed by nursing staff (79. 5 %) in their respective GP surgeries. 70 % and 97 % of GPs found ABPI useful for the diagnosis of asymptomatic and symptomatic PAD, respectively. 69 % of GPs regarded ABPI as a feasible test in primary care practice. Time constraints (84 %), staff availability (89 %) and staff training (72 %) were cited as the main limitations to its use. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted training of nursing staff may improve ABPI usage, although a less time-consuming test for PAD may be another option. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|E

40|$|Introduction - In his paper, Dissent and Dissensus: Making a Difference in the Corporate University, Professor of Nursing at the University of Swansea and Master of Controversy, Gary Rolfe, {{announced}} {{during a}} seminar at the University of Cambridge {{on the occasion}} of this year’s Nurse Education Tomorrow (NET) conference, that the University lies in ‘ruin’. As delegates foraged in their <b>conference</b> <b>packs</b> for disaster survival kits and scanned the nearest exit out of the parlous conﬁne, the presenter fearing abandonment moved swiftly to reassure attendees that the ‘ruin’ was metaphoric and that the University of Cambridge, speciﬁcally, was not being referred to. While calm descended this soon gave way to the nascent discipline being plunged into despair on realising the bleak news that The University; the very fabric of civilised society from which our professional cloth is cut, was actually in tatters. In his paper, Rolfe attacked the state of education provision for nurses at universities, presumably in the UK. First, he bemoaned the fact that educators no longer have any power to effect change in clinical practice. Second, the modern university has developed itself as a corporate business trading in the merchandise of degrees with student consumers content to being administered through an educational system which values student retention and satisfaction above healthcare education needs. Third, Rolfe argued that the role of educators as scholars and researchers is threatened by the need to secure the ‘right’ research grants and to publish in the ‘right’ journals. Finally, in response to these developments he advised educators should stay in the ‘ruin’, but dissent, be subversive...|$|R
2500|$|Since the troika {{controlled}} the Party apparatus through Stalin's Secretariat and Pravda through its editor Bukharin, {{it was able}} to direct the discussion and the process of delegate selection. Although Trotsky's position prevailed within the Red Army and Moscow universities and received about half the votes in the Moscow Party organization, it was defeated elsewhere, and the <b>Conference</b> was <b>packed</b> with pro-troika delegates. In the end, only three delegates voted for Trotsky's position, and the Conference denounced [...] "Trotskyism" [...] as a [...] "petty bourgeois deviation". After the Conference, a number of Trotsky's supporters, especially in the Red Army's Political Directorate, were removed from leading positions or reassigned. Nonetheless, Trotsky kept all of his posts, and the troika was careful to emphasize that the debate was limited to Trotsky's [...] "mistakes" [...] and that removing Trotsky from the leadership was out of the question. In reality, Trotsky had already been cut off from the decision-making process.|$|R

He {{was part of a}} young Nuggets team starring Dikembe Mutombo, LaPhonso Ellis and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf that became the first eighth-seeded team in NBA history to defeat the first-seeded team as the Nuggets defeated the Seattle SuperSonics {{in the first round of}} the 1994 Western <b>Conference</b> Playoffs. <b>Pack</b> was then traded to the Washington Bullets for Doug Overton and Don MacLean on October 30, 1995. Injuries slowed Pack during the prime years of his career, as he never played a full 82-game season. In 31 games for the Bullets, Pack averaged 18.1 ppg, 7.8 apg, 4.3 rpg and 2.00 spg in what was his best season statistically. Prior to the 1996-97 season he was signed by the New Jersey Nets before being traded mid-season to the Dallas Mavericks along with Shawn Bradley, Ed O'Bannon and Khalid Reeves for Sam Cassell, Chris Gatling, Jim Jackson, George McCloud and Eric Montross. Pack remained with the Mavericks through the end of the 1999-00 season, never playing more than the 54 games he played in 1996-97 as injuries slowed his career.|$|R

40|$|House rules {{allow the}} Speaker to choose any conferees he wishes, {{suggesting}} he might use conference delegations to advance partisan goals. In practice, the Speaker nearly always selects {{members of the}} bill’s jurisdictional commit-tee(s). The authors propose a theory of conferee selection that endogenizes both partisan goals and committee partic-ipation. They argue that the Speaker’s incentives lead him to appoint committee members, but he anticipates cases {{in which they would}} produce an outcome unfavorable to the majority party. In these cases, the Speaker appoints other conferees in addition to those from the jurisdictional committee, thereby “packing ” the delegation in favor of the majority party position. The authors derive and test hypotheses regarding when the Speaker <b>packs</b> <b>conference</b> dele-gations, and what delegations look like when packed. The tests support the theory...|$|R

40|$|SummaryMore {{than one}} of my colleagues has cast her eye round the <b>packed</b> <b>conference</b> room and then murmured sotte voce that, well, she was {{suffering}} just a little from Darwin fatigue. So too, more than one commentator has remarked how the bicentenary of his birth and the 150 th anniversary of the Origin have completely outstripped any episode of previous rejoicing. And to play the curmudgeon one might wonder if our obsession with the centential and hemi-centential actually reflects a deeper schadenfreude, a loss of way, an eclipse of confidence. While evolutionary biologists caper round the Darwinian totem, other drum-rolls from Hades remind musicologists that Georg-Friedrich Händel (d. 1759), Joseph Haydn (d. 1809) and Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy (b. 1809) must be dragged from their crepuscular retreats, while enthusiasts for Alfred Tennyson (b. 1809) listen anxiously for the creak of Charon's oars conveying their hero back for a brief exposure in the sunlit pastures...|$|R
5000|$|In 1931, Soviet {{officials}} inquired Le Corbusier’s {{opinion on}} {{the reconstruction of the}} city of Moscow. While in Moscow in 1928, he had taken some quick, hidden (it was prohibited to draw in the streets for fear of espionage) sketches on the city and noted that its plan was “that of the age of the horse.” [...] At the <b>packed</b> <b>conference</b> held at the Polytechnic Museum, he had discussed the significance of city planning and the city’s future, yet at the time Le Corbusier had not been interested in Moscow itself. After his trip, the Soviet Union seemed a central preoccupation. Le Corbusier responded with a 59-page report, “Response to Moscow,” in which he sketched his ideas for the city. Unfortunately, his initial response is not yet available, hidden in private Russian collections. Nevertheless, his response to such inquiry produced the theoretical basis for Ville Radieuse, the Radiant City. That such an important concept for urbanism derived from Le Corbusier’s answer to the Soviet questionnaire suggests the important imprint of the Soviet Union in his career.|$|R
