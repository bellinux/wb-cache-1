500|$|Many {{aspects of}} the Sam & Max comics were {{influenced}} by Purcell's own experiences. Rats and cockroaches are common throughout the franchise, the former inspired by Purcell's pet rat. In another example, Sam and Max are occasionally shown playing a game called [...] "fizzball", in which {{the object of the}} exercise is to hit a <b>can</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> in mid-air with a solid axe handle. Purcell had previously invented the game with his friends, including fellow comic book writers Art Adams and Mike Mignola.|$|E
500|$|A {{scene in}} the episode takes place on the talk show [...] "Afternoon Yak", a parody of The View, with the hosts based on The Views real-life host Barbara Walters and Joy Behar, and former hosts Lisa Ling and Star Jones. The Views {{audience}} members are also referenced, and are depicted in the episode as [...] "giv a huge response" [...] to everything in the program. The play that Bart and Homer are rehearsing {{in the living room}} was written by American playwright Edward Albee. Near the end of the episode, Homer gains strength by drinking a <b>can</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer.</b> The scene parodies the character Popeye, who gained super-strength from eating spinach. Homer also talks {{in a manner similar to}} Popeye after drinking the beer. Marge also resembles Popeye's love interest Olive Oyl in the scene.|$|E
500|$|The dog once {{replaced}} Duffman as the mascot for Duff Beer in {{the episode}} [...] "Old Yeller Belly" [...] (season 14, 2003), {{after he was}} seen drinking from a <b>can</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> by balancing it on his nose. He becomes known as Suds McDuff and boosts sales of Duff Beer, making the family's fortunes explode. However, this prompts his original sleazy owner and racing trainer to visit the Simpsons and prove that he's {{the owner of the}} dog. The family later figures that if they can get Duffman to replace Suds as the Duff mascot, they can get their dog back. They plan to turn Duffman into a hero at a Duff Beer-sponsored beach volleyball event; however, their plan fails and a drunk shark that's discovered at the event becomes the new mascot instead. Santa's Little Helper gladly returns to the Simpson family.|$|E

2500|$|Fellow Miller's Court {{resident}} and prostitute, Mary Ann Cox, who described herself as [...] "a widow and unfortunate", reported seeing Kelly returning home drunk {{in the company}} of a stout ginger-haired man wearing a bowler hat and carrying a <b>can</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> at about 11:45p.m. Cox and Kelly wished each other goodnight. Kelly went into her room with the man and then started singing the song [...] "A Violet I Plucked from Mother's Grave When a Boy."

Elizabeth Prater had the room above Kelly's and when she went to bed at 1:30, the singing had stopped.|$|E

[...] A seventeen-strong DEMS team of RN and Royal Artillery personnel looked after the MAC's substantial defensive armament. [...] To comply with the Board of Trade regulations, all naval and military personnel were signed onto the ship's Articles as supernumerary crew members, for which they received a nominal payment of one shilling per month and the more tangible reward of one <b>can</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> per day. [...] They also received a small 'Merchant Navy' badge, which they apparently wore on their uniforms with cheerful disregard for regulations.|$|E
2500|$|On June 3, {{following}} the dispute with Debra, Austin made his last appearance for WWE on Raw. After Austin no-showed the episode of Raw the following week, his storylines were dropped. Austin walked out again, publicly stating he felt bad storylines {{were presented to}} him by the creative team. This time his departure was for good. McMahon, along with longtime Austin supporter and real-life friend Jim Ross, buried Austin on WWE programming, referring to him as [...] "taking his ball and going home" [...] because he wasn't getting his way, whilst also explaining to the fans that neither he nor Ross were able to persuade Austin to change his mind. McMahon insisted that Austin owed an apology to all the fans across the world, especially those who paid solely to see him that night. McMahon toasted to Austin's career with a beer thanking him for all his hard work nonetheless. The same night, Austin's entrance theme was played during an in-ring segment by Ric Flair, but it was transitioned to Eddie Guerrero's theme and he entered the arena. The Rock also made an appearance on Raw that night, despite being drafted to SmackDown!, and announced his frustrations towards Austin and threw a <b>can</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> at McMahon. Austin's merchandise continued to sell greatly in the weeks following his departure, however with no sign of a return likely to be seen, the company stopped marketing his character, his merchandise, and removed his profile from WWE.com. This period was documented in an episode of WWE Confidential.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No,' {{answered}} Ingiborg,' he rode off {{hunting with}} his father this morning'; {{and going to the}} cupboard she laid the table for her sister.

60|$|While {{he waved}} his hand and muttered that he had done nothing at all, he was obeying her behest by trying to get into a chair.

This was a new experience for him. All his life, up to then, he had been unaware of being either graceful or awkward. Such thoughts of self had never entered his mind. He sat down gingerly {{on the edge of the}} chair, greatly worried by his hands. They were in the way wherever he put them. Arthur was leaving the room, and Martin Eden followed his exit with longing eyes. He felt lost, alone there in the room with that pale spirit of a woman.
