5000|$|IMTS systems {{typically}} had 25 {{watts of}} transmitter {{power at the}} mobile station and 100-250 Watts at the terminal — unlike the older cellular <b>car</b> <b>telephones</b> that had maximum power output of 3 watts and modern cellular handsets with power outputs of 0.6 watts. Mobile installations normally consisted of a [...] "head unit" [...] or the telephone handset which sat in a cradle with a direct dialing keyboard. These looked and functioned much like a landline, or hardwired, telephone. Unlike cellular handsets, these units passed through a dial tone when the receiver was lifted from the cradle {{and in this way}} seemed more like a landline telephone than a cellular handset. There was a separate large radio transceiver chassis, typically measuring at least a foot square and 6 inches high, that was mounted either in the trunk or under the seats of an automobile. These transceivers were connected to the handset cradle with a multi-conductor cable usually around [...]5 inch thick. The mobile antennas almost always required a hole to be drilled {{in the body of the}} car to mount the antenna in; until the 1970s there were no [...] "on-glass" [...] antennas - these were developed later for the cellular car-mounted telephones. The antennas looked much like those used for CB radios and were about 19 in. long (1/4 wavelength at 155 MHz). These mobile telephone systems required a large amount of power (10 to 15 amperes at 12 volts) and this was supplied by thick power cabling connected directly to the automobile's battery. It therefore was quite possible and not uncommon for an IMTS telephone to drain an automobile's battery if used for moderate periods of time without the automobile engine running or if left on overnight. Optionally these units were also connected to the car's horn and were switched to honk the horn as a ringer when receiving an incoming call if the user was away from the car at the time of the call.|$|E

This software {{can be very}} simple, such as lighting controls running on an 8-bit microcontroller with a few kilobytes of memory with the suitable level of processing complexity determined with a Probably Approximately Correct Computation framework (a methodology based on randomized algorithms), or can become very sophisticated in applications such as airplanes, missiles, and process control systems.|$|R
50|$|Farmers {{had already}} applied the profits {{obtained}} with {{coffee in the}} constitution of several types of companies in São Carlos: banks, electricity, cable <b>cars,</b> <b>telephones,</b> water pumps, sewers, theaters, hospitals and schools. This established a foundation for industrialization in the city. With the arrival of immigrants from other urban centers from the 1930s - 1940s, their expertise was used to consolidate industrialization as the main economic activity in the city. Its peak years were the 1950s, when São Carlos became a manufacturing center, with relevant industrial expression in São Paulo state.|$|R
5000|$|Bryden’s {{best known}} works are his {{panoramic}} views, usually from Mt. Holyoke in Hadley, Mass. In this work {{he focuses on}} nature as a paradox. Bryden says, “Nature up close is wild and brutal, but from a distance it is serene and ordered.” In all of his landscapes he emphasizes nature over man. Carl Little in Paintings of New England says “In his landscapes of the Pioneer Valley of Massachusetts Lewis Bryden {{has been known to}} edit out all the accumulated debris of modern life, including <b>cars,</b> <b>telephone</b> poles, and road signs.” ...|$|R

6000|$|The other {{tradition}} {{is that the}} significant features of all villages are whiskers, iron dogs upon lawns, gold bricks, checkers, jars of gilded cat-tails, and shrewd comic old men who are known as [...] "hicks" [...] and who ejaculate [...] "Waal I swan." [...] This altogether admirable tradition rules the vaudeville stage, facetious illustrators, and syndicated newspaper humor, but out of actual life it passed forty years ago. Carol's small town thinks not in hoss-swapping but in cheap motor <b>cars,</b> <b>telephones,</b> ready-made clothes, silos, alfalfa, kodaks, phonographs, leather-upholstered Morris chairs, bridge-prizes, oil-stocks, motion-pictures, land-deals, unread sets of Mark Twain, and a chaste version of national politics.|$|R
5000|$|The {{force of}} the {{explosion}} was powerful enough to launch a mining <b>car,</b> <b>telephone</b> poles, and other equipment across the canyon, a distance of nearly {{a mile from the}} entrance to the mine. [...] The steel gates of the mine were ripped from their concrete foundations. Inside the mine, rails were twisted, roof supports were destroyed, afterdamp and coal dust filled the air, and the lamps of the surviving miners were blown out. As these men attempted to relight their lamps, a second explosion was sparked, killing the remainder of the workers in the mine. A third explosion occurred approximately 20 minutes later, causing a destructive cave-in.|$|R

50|$|The Germania Cornet Band {{folded in}} the early 1920s. Around the nation, {{the heyday of the}} {{community}} brass band was drawing to a close as phonographs, movies, and radio provided new ways to hear music, and the advent of <b>cars,</b> <b>telephones,</b> and better roads reduced the isolation of rural communities. However these same factors eased the creation of rural community clubs, and the newly-formed Germania Community Club took on a key role in local social life. Throughout the 1930s the club sponsored educational lectures, talent shows, and spelling bees at the hall. They also organized a popular annual picnic that typically included music, dancing, speeches, food concessions, and sporting contests such as races, horseshoes, wrestling, boxing, tug-of-war, and baseball.|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{systems for}} linking and {{supporting}} robust social connections between people, {{whether they are}} in close proximity or distributed over longer distances, have included point to point solutions (letters, <b>cars,</b> <b>telephone),</b> task-focused or work-modelling solutions (memos, forms, manuals), and one-to-many broadcast solutions (radio, TV, newspapers). More recently, computationally based systems {{have been designed to}} support various aspects of collaboration, coordination and community: e-mail, newsgroups, bulletin boards, and shared task tools and other examples. However, the key factor for successful utilization of such communication technologies is whether the users recognize the system as an important interaction place.

40|$|Current {{use case}} {{guidelines}} typically recommend a goal-driven process for use case creation and, in many cases, this approach indeed works sufficiently well. Yet, in our experience, this goal-driven approach {{does not seem}} to offer the best fit for every kind of function, e. g. for highly context-sensitive automotive driver assistance systems. For these functions we suggest selecting a context-driven process for use case creation. In this paper we first show the effectiveness of goal-driven use case creation for a usual <b>car</b> <b>telephone</b> function. Then we demonstrate the limits of this approach for an adaptive vehicle cruise control function (the Distronic system). Finally we present our basic ideas of a context-driven use case creation process and evidence its advantages as compared to the goal-driven approach using the example of the Distronic function. 1...|$|R

This note gives an overview of SWOV recommendations which have not yet come into realisation and/or preparation within Dutch road safety policy, but are still of current interest. The overview is based on publications since 1994, and is thematically grouped around `vehicles' and `behaviour of road users'. The vehicle category includes the following: bicycles; mopeds and low-speed mopeds (In Dutch: "snorfietsen"); motorcycles; passenger cars; vans; heavy vehicles; agricultural vehicles; and telematics. The road users' behaviour category contains the following aspects: general and special speed limits; publicity along the road and road safety; alcohol use; drugs; <b>car</b> <b>telephone,</b> older people; traffic education; driver training; and rewarding desired traffic behaviour...|$|R
40|$|What is innovation? How {{important}} is innovation in business? How can {{we use it}} to succeed? In the last 150 years our world has been transformed [...] largely due to innovation. Our parents were born into a world where television {{had yet to be}} invented, and there was no penicillin or frozen food. Our great grandparents began life in a world with no light bulbs, <b>cars,</b> <b>telephones,</b> or airplanes. This Very Short Introduction looks at what innovation is and why it can affect us so profoundly. It examines how it occurs, who stimulates it, how it is pursued, and what its outcomes are, both positive and negative. The book shows that innovation is hugely challenging and failure is common, yet it is essential to our social and economic progress. Mark Dodgson and David Gann also consider the extent to which our understanding of innovation has developed over the past century and how it might be used to interpret the global economy we all face in the future...|$|R
