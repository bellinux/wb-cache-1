40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} a low cost, high gain, low {{cross-polar}} and compact edge feed printed elliptical antenna with a partial ground plane and parasitic patches is proposed and investigated. The proposed antenna is fabricated on a 1. 6 mm thick FR 4 substrate with dielectric constant of 4. 4 and loss tangent of 0. 025. The total planar {{area of the}} proposed antenna (L × W) is 28 × 24 mm 2. Both the simulated and experimental result shows that the proposed antenna provides a frequency range compatible with the ultra-wideband (UWB) standard, i. e., 3. 5 GHz– 12 GHz frequency band. The radiation pattern produced by the proposed antenna is approximately omnidirectional with inphase excitation of Surface waves resulting in less cross-polarization level (less than 20 dB) compared to its <b>co-polar</b> <b>component</b> for the entire impedance band width. The maximum measured gain for the fabricated antenna is around 6. 27 dBi with an average efficiency of above 90 % throughout the bandwidth. A linear phase response (phase of S 21) accompanied by a constant group delay of 1 ns throughout the measured bandwidth makes the proposed antenna {{a good candidate for}} UWB applications. 1...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the polarimetric responses of PALSAR (L-band) data and scattering mechanisms of some tropical forest typologies based on target decomposition. The fundamentals of polarimetric theory related to both SAR topics under development are summarized. For representation of polarimetric signatures, the cross-section {{of the forest}} target was plotted on a bi-dimensional graphic {{as a function of}} the orientation angle, ellipticity angle and the intensity of <b>co-polar</b> <b>components</b> of the radar signal. The analysis of scattering mechanisms was done by the association of entropy and mean alpha values of each sample, plotted in a bi-dimensional classification space. This study improves the understanding of the interaction mechanisms between L-band PALSAR signals and structural parameters supporting the forest inventory in the Brazilian Amazon region.
