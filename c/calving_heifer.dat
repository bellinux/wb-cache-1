40|$|The study {{assessed}} the fertility and purity of sexed semen used for inseminating Holstein-Friesian heifers in commercial dairy herds. Sex-sorted semen from 4 proven Holstein-Friesian bulls and available under commercial conditions was used on nulliparous Hol- stein heifers reared on 61 dairy farms of northern Italy. Data from 536 artificial inseminations with pregnancy diagnosis and 258 calvings {{were analyzed using}} the logistic regression procedure. The effects of year and season of insemination or calving, age at insemination or <b>calving,</b> <b>heifer</b> inbreeding, and the sperm dose used for insemination on {{the probability of a}} positive preg- nancy diagnosis or of the birth of a female calf, respec- tively, were studied. The overall pregnancy rate for sexed semen was 51 % and was affected by year of in- semination and bull. Heifers inseminated with sexed semen from 2 bulls had lower pregnancy rates than heifers inseminated with sexed semen from other bulls. Purity of the sexed sperm, based on the proportion of female calves, was 87 % and this percentage was not affected by explanatory variables included in the logis- tic regression. The results demonstrate that bulls differ in terms of fertility of their sexed semen. Careful selec- tion of the insemination sires used for sorted semen is advisable for avoiding low fertility inseminations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Objectives of {{the study}} were to {{document}} the impact of some management factors on the occurrence of clinical mastitis in primiparous dairy cows and to identify common udder pathogens of clinical mastitis in freshly <b>calved</b> <b>heifers</b> and multiparous cows on the day of calving. Methods A one-year study was conducted during 2004 and 2005 in 11 selected Estonian dairy herds. Data consisted of 68 heifers with clinical mastitis and 995 heifers without clinical mastitis on the day of calving. Multivariable logistic regression with a random herd effect was used to investigate any association between housing system or the time interval from movement of <b>heifers</b> to the <b>calving</b> facility and day of calving on occurrence of clinical mastitis. Milk samples for bacteriological analysis were collected from affected heifers and multiparous cows on the day of calving Results Clinical mastitis occurrence in the study population of freshly <b>calved</b> <b>heifers</b> equalled 6. 1 %. Housing system was not a significant risk factor for clinical mastitis of freshly <b>calved</b> <b>heifers.</b> Moving heifers to the cowbarn less than two weeks before calving in tiestall farms increased risk (OR = 5. 9 p = 0. 001) for clinical mastitis at parturition. The most frequently isolated udder pathogens among heifers were Escherichia coli (22. 1 %), Streptococcus uberis (19. 1 %) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (8. 8 %). In comparison, the main pathogen in multiparous cows with clinical mastitis at parturition was Staphylococcus aureus (11. 2 %). Conclusion Moving <b>heifers</b> to the <b>calving</b> facilities too late in tiestall farms increased risk for clinical mastitis at parturition. The isolated udder pathogens did not differ significantly in tiestall farms compared to freestall farms in heifers, but differences were found between heifers and multiparous cows at parturition. </p...|$|R

In selected breed was monitored process of heifer grow by periodical weighting in three months interval, furthermore was taken for these heifers these reproduction indices: 1 st insemination age, insemination index, 1 st <b>calve</b> age. <b>Heifers</b> are divided by rearing form (graze, stable) and compared differences in grow intesities and reproduction efficiency between particular groups. Subsequently, for cows on first lactation were monitored and compared these indices: level of milk performance, content of milk elements, degree of physical condition, indices of fertility. Dairy cows are divided into groups according to how they were reared as heifers (graze, stable). When comparing growth of heifers, grazed heifers reaches higher values than group of not grazed heifers. Grazed heifers grows more quickly: at age 3 months was their average weight 93, 26 Kg against 88, 30 Kg not grazed heifers. At age 6 months was weight of grazed heifers 169, 51 kg against 161, 80 kg not grazed heifers, At age 9 months was values 236, 47 kg for grazed heifers, 228, 07 kg for not grazed heifers, at age 12 months 326, 62 kg and 299, 87 kg, at age 15 months 366, 11 kg and 359, 98 kg. From reproduction indices have been found statistically significant differences in age at 1 st insemination, when the grazed heifers were flushed in average age of 18, 43 months against not grazed heifers in age of 17, 12 months. In addition, was found statistically significant differences in age at first calving, when the values obtained for the group of grazed heifers was 28. 63 months and for not grazed heifers 27, 73 months.

The objectives of this study were {{to determine the effects of}} precalving Se supplementation and type of supplementation on the blood activity of glutathione peroxidase and measures of udder health immediately after calving and during the first month of lactation in pastured dairy heifers. One hundred forty pregnant Chilean Holstein-Friesian heifers were fed a basal diet containing, on average, 0. 15 mg of Se/kg of dry matter. One month before predicted <b>calving,</b> <b>heifers</b> were allocated to 1 of 3 groups. Group 1 (n = 49) received no supplementary Se, group 2 (n = 46) received a single subcutaneous injection of Se (1 mg/kg of live weight, as barium selenate), and group 3 (n = 45) was fed Se yeast (3 mg/heifer/d until <b>calving).</b> <b>Heifers</b> supplemented with barium selenate had a higher glutathione peroxidase activity from 14 d in milk onwards.

40|$|Dairy farmers often keep {{almost all}} their newborn <b>heifer</b> <b>calves</b> despite {{the high cost}} of rearing. By rearing all <b>heifer</b> <b>calves,</b> farmers have more {{security}} and retain flexibility to cope with the uncertainty in the availability of replacement heifers in time. This uncertainty is due to mortality or infertility during the rearing period and the variation in culling rate of lactating cows. The objective {{of this study is to}} provide insight in the economically optimal number of <b>heifer</b> <b>calves</b> to be reared as replacements. A herd-level stochastic simulation model was developed specific for this purpose with a herd of 100 dairy cows; the biological part of the model consisted of a dairy herd unit and rearing unit for replacement heifers. The dairy herd unit included variation in the number of culled dairy cows. The rearing unit incorporated variation in the number of heifers present in the herd by including uncertainty in mortality and variation in fertility. The dairy herd unit and rearing unit were linked by the number of replacement heifers and culled dairy cows. When not enough replacement heifers were available to replace culled dairy cows, the herd size was temporarily reduced, resulting in an additional cost for the empty slots. When the herd size reached 100 dairy cows, the available replacement heifers that were not needed were sold. It was assumed that no purchase of cows and calves occurred. The optimal percentage of 2 -wk-old <b>heifer</b> <b>calves</b> to be retained was defined as the percentage of <b>heifer</b> <b>calves</b> that minimized the average net costs of rearing replacement heifers. In the default scenario, the optimal retention was 73 % and the total net cost of rearing was estimated at â‚¬ 40, 939 per herd per year.

40|$|Behavioural {{observations}} {{were conducted on}} 20 calves (10 bull <b>calves</b> and 10 <b>heifer</b> <b>calves).</b> The first series of observations {{was made in the}} first 4 days of life, and the second after a month (within 30 to 33 days of calving). Time from birth to first unassisted standing (standing on all extended legs) ranged from 16 minutes (heifers) to 158 minutes (bulls) for normal calving. Calves born from normal parturitions stood up after an average of 81 minutes and those born from difficult parturitions after 302 minutes. Calves that required assistance at calving showed shorter standing and longer lying time. In the first 4 days of life and after a month, both male and female calves were more often in left lateral recumbency when resting. <b>Heifer</b> <b>calves</b> more often visited the feeder while bull calves more often consumed concentrates, water and hay...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the effect of maintenance type and maturity level of bali cattle to the total of non coliform bacteria in bali cattle. A total of 24 samples of bali cattleâ€™s feces were used. This study was a Factorial 2 x 3 of group-randomised design, contained of two type maintenance (TPA Suwung and Sobangan) and three levels of cattle maturity (<b>calves,</b> <b>heifers,</b> and adult). The groups were based on time sampling. The data then analyzed using Analysis of Variance Test and continued by using Least Significant Different test. The results showed that the amount of non-coliform bacteria in adult bali cattle feces were higher then <b>heifers</b> and <b>calves.</b> Total of non coliform bacteria in bali cattle in Â landfill was higher then the cattle that reared in captivity in Bali Cattle Breeding Center, the Sobangan village of Mengwi Badung regency...|$|R
40|$|The 1990 Annual KSU Dairy Day {{is known}} as Dairy Day, 1990 Seventy-three, neonatal, Holstein, <b>heifer</b> <b>calves</b> in one {{experiment}} and 45 neonatal, Holstein, bull calves in another were used to {{study the effects of}} dietary Aspergillus oryzae extract (Amaferm) on calf performance. Forty of the <b>heifer</b> <b>calves</b> were selected to study the effects on ruminal microbial and metabolic development. In general, Amaferm-supplemented calves had greater ruminal microbial activity than the calves fed no Amaferm. For the most part, growth and feed intake were not affected...|$|R
