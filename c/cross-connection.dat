30|$|The <b>cross-connections</b> {{depicted}} in Figs. 3, 4, 7 a, 8, and 9 {{show that the}} underlying concept aims at improving the modeling of the inter-frame correlation, e.g., to increase the robustness of the acoustic model against reverberation. If applied in a straightforward way, such <b>cross-connections</b> would entail a costly modification of the Viterbi decoder. In this paper, we summarized some important approximations that allow for a more efficient decoding of the extended Bayesian network, cf. Subsections 4.5, 4.6, 6.6. 1, and 6.7. Some of these typically empirically motivated or just intuitive approximations, especially neglected statistical dependencies, become obvious from a Bayesian network, as shown in Figs. 4 and 7.|$|R

50|$|A typical {{substation}} {{includes two}} to four 138/12 kV transformers, 138 kV air switches that permit isolation of individual transformers, shutdown {{one of the two}} 138 kV feeders, or <b>cross-connection</b> from one feeder to another.

50|$|Current {{switching}} applications include passive protection switching for service restoration following a disruption, {{such as a}} fiber cut. One common application for switches is in Remote Fiber Test Systems (RFTSs) that can monitor and locate a fault on a fiber transmission line. An emerging application of optical switches is optical <b>cross-connection.</b> Optical cross-connects utilize optical switching fabrics to establish an interconnection between multiple optical inputs and outputs.|$|E
50|$|Back-siphonage {{occurs when}} higher {{pressure}} fluids, gases, or suspended solids move {{to an area}} of lower pressure fluids. For example, when a drinking straw is used to consume a beverage, suction reduces the pressure of fluid inside the straw, causing liquid {{to move from the}} cup to inside the straw and then into the drinker's mouth. This is an example of an indirect <b>cross-connection,</b> undesirable material being pulled into the system.|$|E

40|$|The {{elaborate}} <b>cross-connections</b> among membranous organelles (MO), microtubules (MT), and neurofilaments (NF) {{were demonstrated}} in unifixed axons by the quick-freeze, deep-etch, and rotary-shadowing method. They were categorized into three groups: NF-associated cross-linker, MT-associated cross-bridges, and long cross-links in the subaxolemmal space. Other methods were also employed {{to make sure}} that the observed <b>cross-connections</b> in the unfixed axons were not a result of artifactual condensation or precipitation of soluble components or salt during deep-etching. Axolemma were permeablized either chemically (0. 1 % saponin) or physically (gentle homogenization), to allow egress of their soluble components from the axon; or else the axons were washed with distilled water after fixation. After physical rupture of the axolemma or saponin treatment, most of the MO remained intact. MT were stabilized by adding taxol in the incubation medium. Axons prepared by these methods contained many longitudinally oriented NF connected to each other by numerous fine cross-linkers (4 - 6 nm in diameter, 20 - 50 nm in length). Two specialized regions were apparent within the axons: one composed of fascicles of MT linked with each other by fine cross-bridges; the other was in the subaxolemmal space and consisted of actinlike filaments and a network of long cross-links (50 - 150 nm) which connected axolemma and actinlike filaments with NF and MT. F-actin was localized to the subaxolemmal space by the nitrobenzooxadiazol phallacidin method. MO were located mainly in these two specialized regions and were intimately associated with MT via fine short (10 - 20 nm in length) cross-bridges. Cross-links from NF to MO and MT were also common. All these <b>cross-connections</b> were observed after chemical extraction or physical rupture of the axon; however, these procedures removed granular materials which were attached to the filaments in the fresh unextracted axons. The <b>cross-connections</b> were also found in the axons washed with distilled water after fixation. I conclude that the cross- connections are real structures while the granular material is composed of soluble material, probably protein in nature...|$|R

50|$|In a Wi-Fi P2P group, {{the group}} owner {{operates}} as an access point {{and all other}} devices are clients. There are two main methods to establish a group owner in the Wi-Fi Direct group. In one approach, the user sets up a P2P group owner manually. This method {{is also known as}} Autonomous Group Owner (autonomous GO). In the second method, also called negotiation-based group creation, two devices compete based on the group owner intent value. The device with higher intent value becomes a group owner and the second device becomes a client. Group owner intent value can depend on whether the wireless device performs a <b>cross-connection</b> between an infrastructure WLAN service and a P2P group, remaining power in the wireless device, whether the wireless device is already a group owner in another group and/or a received signal strength of the first wireless device.|$|E

30|$|In OFDM, {{as long as}} {{the channel}} delay spread and the {{possible}} synchronization errors remain within the cyclic prefix time, equalization can simply be done with a complex coefficient multiplication at subcarrier level. This approach is also applicable to FBMC, if the ratio of channel delay spread in samples and number of subchannels is sufficiently low, since the frequency variation within a subchannel is then small enough that it can be considered flat fading. But as this is not the general case, more effective channel equalization methods have been developed for FBMC. The single complex coefficient is usually considered when the FB waveforms are well localized in time and frequency domains to limit the effect on consecutive symbols and neighboring subchannels [5, 29, 30]. Longer finite impulse response (FIR) filters as subcarrier equalizers with <b>cross-connections</b> between the adjacent subchannels to cancel the ICI are studied in [31, 32]. To avoid the <b>cross-connections</b> between subchannels, an oversampled receiver filter bank structure with per-subcarrier FIR equalizers can restore the orthogonality of the subcarrier waveforms. This approach is followed in [33 – 37] and more recently with MMSE equalizers explicitly for FBMC/OQAM in [38].|$|R
