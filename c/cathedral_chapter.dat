5|$|Warelwast's {{relations}} with his <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> were good, and no disputes arose during his episcopate. It {{was not until}} late in his bishopric that the diocese was split into multiple archdeaconries, which appears to have happened in 1133. Warelwast instituted the two offices of treasurer and precentor for the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter,</b> {{as well as the}} first sub-archdeacons, who were under the archdeacons. Sub-archdeacons are not attested again at Exeter until the episcopate of Bartholomew Iscanus, who was bishop from 1161–1184. William of Malmesbury felt that during Warelwast's episcopate the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> relaxed its communal living, which previously had been strong. It is likely that during Warelwast's episcopate the canons of the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> quit living in a communal dormitory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} Middle Ages, {{the text of}} the Libellus was used to support the claims of the monks of the Canterbury <b>Cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> that the chapter had always {{included}} monks, back to the founding of the cathedral by Augustine. But the Libellus does not explicitly say that the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> should be composed of monks, only that the monks that were members of the chapter should live in common and have some other aspects of monastic life.|$|E
5|$|Thomas reorganised the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> {{during his}} archiepiscopate, {{establishing}} {{a group of}} secular canons with individual prebends to provide the clergy with income. The <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> at York had until then lived in a group, but Thomas' reforms allowed the clergy to live in their own houses. Thomas also set up a number of officials within the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter,</b> including a dean, treasurer, and precentor. He {{increased the number of}} clergy in the chapter, increasing it from the three he found at York when he took office, and reorganised the episcopal and chapter's estates, giving a number of estates to the chapter. He introduced the continental system of archdeacons to the Diocese of York, dividing the diocese into territorial units and appointing an archdeacon to each. Archdeacons were responsible for aiding the bishop or archbishop with his episcopal duties, collecting revenues, and presiding over some judicial courts.|$|E

5|$|After Gebhard's expulsion, Ernst assumed full {{charge of}} the Electorate of Cologne. In his later years, a nuncio at Cologne took {{responsibilities}} for the financial administration of the archdiocese, and Ernst's nephew, Ferdinand of Bavaria, {{was elected to the}} <b>Cathedral</b> <b>Chapter,</b> the Wittelsbach heir-apparent. When Ernst died in 1612, the <b>Cathedral</b> <b>Chapter</b> duly elected his nephew to the position and Wittelsbachs held the Electorate until 1761. Ernst's victory, both in winning the election in 1583, and in convincing the assembly of other electors to accept him in 1585, confirmed him as the new archbishop of Cologne and gave the Wittelsbach family a foothold on the northern Rhine.|$|E
5|$|As bishop, de Gray {{settled a}} long-running {{dispute between the}} monks of his <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> and his {{predecessors}} as bishop. He also allowed the monks of his <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> the right to appoint and replace the clergy of the dependent churches of the cathedral. De Gray received a 1203 missive from Innocent III decrying the marriages of some secular clergy, in contravention of canon law. In more secular matters, he granted the town of Bishop's Lynn (now King's Lynn) the right to hold a weekly market and two fairs per year. He also built a palace at Gaywood.|$|E
5|$|Chesney {{was elected}} to the See of Lincoln on 13 December 1148, by his <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter,</b> {{apparently}} without outside interference. He was consecrated by Theobald of Bec at Canterbury Cathedral on 19December, the day after his ordination as a priest.|$|E

5|$|De Lacy gave {{land to the}} <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> of Hereford Cathedral. He {{also gave}} a manor at Guiting to the Knights Templar and two churches, at Weobley and Clodock to Llanthony Priory, which was a monastery founded by his family.|$|E
5|$|Norreis was {{a native}} of {{northern}} England and his family was probably of Norse origin. He was a monk at Christ Church Priory, the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> of Canterbury Cathedral; when he became a monk is unknown. In 1187 he was appointed treasurer of the priory, and in that role was sent by the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> to King Henry II of England to plead their case against Baldwin of Forde, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The archbishop and his monks were in dispute over Baldwin's plan to found a collegiate church at Hackington in honour of Thomas Becket which most of the monks opposed because they feared it would diminish the prestige of their priory.|$|E
5|$|Theobald's <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> was {{composed}} of monks, and he was considered the abbot of the monastery of Christ Church Cathedral. Because of his episcopal duties, the regular running of the cathedral was {{the responsibility of the}} prior. At the time of Theobald's election there were about 140 monks in the chapter, and they seem to have expected that Theobald, being a monk himself, would take their side in disputes and continue to support their needs. Theobald began well, sending a party of monks from the cathedral to St Martin's Priory at Dover, which had been settled with canons instead of monks. Theobald replaced the canons with the monks. Theobald also refounded a collegiate church at South Malling near Lewes to provide benefices for his <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{contemporary}} <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapters,</b> {{the most}} common roles besides dean include precentor, pastor, sub-dean/vice-dean, chancellor, archdeacon, treasurer and missioner, although {{there is also a}} wide variety of roles which each occur only once or twice.|$|R
50|$|He {{was the son}} of Count Franz Anton of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch and {{his wife}} Anna Maria Eusebia of Königsegg-Aulendorf. His elder brother Ferdinand Leopold was also at various times canon of several <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapters,</b> first {{minister}} of Cologne, and ruling Count of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch.|$|R
50|$|He {{was awarded}} degrees in canon law and {{theology}} by the University of Paris. He {{then became a}} canon of the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapters</b> at Amiens and then in Paris. A royal adviser, he travelled to Rome, and was made Auditor of the Rota in 1282.|$|R
5|$|During William's {{last years}} he {{attempted}} to reform St Martin's, Dover. The king had granted the church to the archbishop and the diocese of Canterbury in 1130, and William had a new church building constructed near Dover. The archbishop had planned to install canons regular into the church, and on William's deathbed dispatched a party of canons from Merton Priory to take over St Martin's. However, the party of canons, who had been accompanied by two bishops and some other clergy, were prevented from entering by a monk of Canterbury Cathedral, who claimed that St Martin's belonged to the monks of the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter.</b> The canons from Merton did not press {{the issue in the}} face of the Canterbury chapter's appeal to Rome, and after William's death, the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> sent 12monks to St Martin's instead.|$|E
5|$|Foliot died 7 August 1234, {{after an}} illness {{that began in}} the spring. He was buried in Hereford Cathedral, where his tomb survives. Foliot {{appointed}} his younger brother Thomas to offices in the diocese, first as precentor in the 1220s and then around 1230 as treasurer of the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{had been}} one of three members of the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> from Hereford sent to King Henry III's court to secure {{permission}} for the chapter to hold an election in 1219 Foliot was elected to the see of Hereford in June 1219 and consecrated on 27 October 1219 along with William de Goldcliff, the Bishop of Llandaff, at Canterbury.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title of}} archdeacon is still conferred on a canon of various <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapters,</b> {{and the word}} [...] "archdeacon" [...] has been defined in {{relation}} to the Latin Catholic Church as [...] "a title of honour conferred only on a member of a cathedral chapter".|$|R
40|$|During the {{organisation}} of the Hungarian ecclesiastical {{system at the}} turn of the 11 - 12 th centuries, cathedral monasteries came into being, initially populated by Benedictine monks and canons. The canons of <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapters</b> in Hungary lived in vita communis until the end of the 12 th century. Henceforth, <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapters</b> were regarded as independent legal entities. The 13 th century was a period of expansion for the canons in Hungary. In the first part of the century, canons, with the help of the king and bishops, extended their remarkable influence over the country’s clergy and obtained a considerable share in the tithe income of country churches. In the second half of the 13 th century and having established their wealth and consciousness, the canons also attempted to strengthen their position in opposition to prelates. This period may be characterised by the clashes between bishops and <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapters.</b> The latter were appointed by the king from the ranks of court priests, which seriously limited the social status of canons who were unable to develop a consistent policy against the prelates. A prosopographical analysis of this ecclesiastic group leads to several conclusions, as presented in this paper. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologi...|$|R

5|$|Geoffrey long faced {{opposition}} from {{some members of}} his <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> led by Henry Marshal, Burchard du Puiset, and Roger of London. They objected to his having given {{a large part of}} York's treasury toward Richard's ransom, and to some of his appointments in the church of York. Charges of simony, extortion, and neglect of his duties were lodged against Geoffrey, who in return excommunicated the ringleaders more than once, and locked the canons out of church. Geoffrey also faced difficulties with his appointees to the office of Dean of York; his first choice, his half-brother Peter, was opposed by the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter.</b> Geoffrey's second choice, Simon of Apulia, the chancellor of York, refused to give up the office when Geoffrey decided to award it to a third man, Philip of Poitou. Simon was supported by the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter,</b> who elected him to the office despite Geoffrey's opposition. An appeal was made to the papacy by Geoffrey while Simon travelled to King Richard in Germany. The king refused to allow the appeal and tried to summon Geoffrey to Germany to resolve the issue. Geoffrey was unable to leave York because of disturbances within the cathedral clergy, and Simon managed to secure papal confirmation as Dean of York.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey's {{ordination}} as {{a priest}} took place at Southwell on 23 September 1189, in a ceremony performed by John the Bishop of Whithorn. Geoffrey then went to York, but until his election was ratified by the pope he refused to allow Burchard to take up his office. This stance was supported {{by most of the}} York <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter.</b> Geoffrey then was sent by Richard to escort William the Lion from Scotland to Canterbury. It was at Canterbury that papal assent to Geoffrey's election was secured in December, when Giovanni d'Anagni, the papal legate, not only confirmed the election, but rejected the various appeals made by the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> against Geoffrey. But the king forced Geoffrey to allow the royal appointments, and pay a fine of £2000 before his lands were restored, although Geoffrey was allowed some time to make the full payment.|$|E
5|$|Hugh of Avalon died on 16 November 1200, but no new bishop {{was elected}} {{for over two}} years. King John first tried to impose his own appointee, {{but was unable to}} force his choice on the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter,</b> who were {{responsible}} for electing a new bishop. John then left the see vacant, and some contemporaries accused the king of doing so to secure the revenues of the see for himself because of the regalian right English kings had to receive all the income from a vacant bishopric. Eventually the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> was allowed to perform an election, and Blois was elected about 6 July 1203 and consecrated on 24 August 1203 at Canterbury. The consecration was performed by William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise, the Bishop of London, because Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury was ill and unable to perform the service which would normally have been his right.|$|E

5|$|In 1187 Walter, {{along with}} Glanvill and King Henry II, {{attempted}} to mediate a {{dispute between the}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Baldwin of Forde, and the monks of the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter.</b> Their efforts were fruitless, and Walter was later drawn back into the dispute, in early 1189 and again as archbishop. The dispute centred on the attempt by Baldwin to build a church dedicated to Saint Thomas Becket, just outside the town of Canterbury. The plan was to staff the church with canons instead of monks, which the monks of Canterbury's <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> feared {{was an attempt to}} take away the cathedral chapter's right to elect the archbishop. The attempt in 1189 was settled by Baldwin giving up the site near Canterbury for one further away at Lambeth, which was less threatening to the monks.|$|E
5|$|In December 1582, Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg, the Prince-elector of Cologne, {{converted}} to Protestantism. The principle of ecclesiastical reservation required his resignation. Instead, he declared religious parity for his subjects and, in 1583, married Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben, intending {{to convert the}} ecclesiastical principality into a secular, dynastic duchy.

5|$|John's {{attempt to}} impose de Gray's {{election}} as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1205 {{was the beginning}} of the king's long quarrel with Pope Innocent III. After Hubert Walter's death in July 1205, the selection of a successor was hindered by doubts about what the proper procedure should be, something that commonly happened with elections to Canterbury. John postponed a decision while delegations from the bishops of England and the monks of the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> went to Rome to seek guidance from the pope. The bishops of the province of Canterbury claimed the right to a say in who was elected, as whoever was chosen would be their superior, but according to canon law the monks of the <b>cathedral</b> <b>chapter</b> had the right to elect the new archbishop. The king also had a say in the election, as the archbishop was a major tenant-in-chief and was traditionally one of the principal royal advisers.|$|E
