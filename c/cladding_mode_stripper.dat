40|$|The PhD activity, {{from which}} this thesis is taken, has been aimed at the design and {{development}} of optical components and subsystems for industrial and biomedical laser applications. Industrial-grade high-power laser market, traditionally dominated by gas and solid state lasers, is currently being revolutionized by two new devices, namely fiber and direct diode lasers, which are partly competing and partly complementary. On the one hand, Fiber Lasers (FLs) make use of rare-earth doped specialty fibers to converted the radiation from semiconductor laser modules (the "pump" source) into a high quality beam at an another wavelength; their strong point is the brightness enhancement, although at the expenses of the conversion efficiency. On the other hand, Direct Diode Lasers (DDLs) rely on the combination of semiconductor laser chips, {{similar to those used}} as pump for FLs, to achieve kilowatt-range output power, which is then delivered to the piece under treatment without the need of further conversion or processing; their strong point is the wall-plug efficiency, while the beam quality is typically low. Different applications may privilege one or the other technological approach: for instance, metal sheet cutting and industrial additive manufacturing from metal powders are more suited for FLs, whereas welding and brazing for DDLs. The first part of the PhD activity have been devoted to the design and development of high power laser systems, yielding to the all-fiber realization of a 600 W single-mode Yb-doped FL module and 500 W to 2000 W low-brightness DDLs. First, different architectural solutions have been investigated and optimized, considering feasibility issues, energy consumption and overall ownership costs. Then, key fiber components, such as fused fiber combiners, <b>cladding</b> <b>mode</b> <b>strippers</b> and laser end-caps, which are usually not commercially available being too dependent on the fiber characteristics and other application related constraints, have been designed fabricated and tested. These devices have been later used to assemble demonstrators of fiber and direct diode laser systems for industrial applications. The implemented FL has reached ~ 600 W of nearly single-modeoutput, with Beam Parameter Product (BPP) less than 0. 54 mm mrad. As for the DDL case, two demonstrators (~ 500 W power with BPP 44. 4 mm mrad and ~ 2 kW power with laser BPP 66. 5 mm mrad) have been realized and engineered. In all the cases, the output power has been limited to available diodes only. The second part of the PhD, and thus of the thesis, has been focused on the laser application in the biomedical field, and in particular to the laser ablation of solid tumors in liver and pancreas. Innovative applicators for laser tumor ablation with customized beam irradiation pattern and integrated all-optical temperature sensing capabilities have been designed and manufactured. The prototypes have been validated in liver phantoms (e. g. agar jelly and porcine livers), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solution and encourage further developments toward clinical applications. It is important to highlight that during the PhD the entire chain from design to manufacturing, to applications, has been explored and this has allowed acquiring new skills in different areas, not strictly limited to the main topic of the thesi...|$|R

40|$|Fibre Bragg Gratings (FBGs) {{are known}} to suffer from short-wavelength, {{transmission}} losses due to resonant coupling into backward-propagating <b>cladding</b> <b>modes.</b> Figure 1 shows a typical transmission spectrum of a 10 cm standard FBG. The <b>cladding</b> <b>mode</b> losses increase with grating reflectivity and could eventually impose severe limitations {{in the use of}} FBGs.

For temperature sensitivity, the higher order <b>cladding</b> <b>mode</b> of Ex- TFG exhibited lower temperature sensitivity, quantitatively, the temperature sensitivities of TM <b>cladding</b> <b>modes</b> at the resonance wavelength around 1550 nm are 9 pm/°C, 6. 8 pm/°C, 5. 6 pm/°C and, 4 pm/°C for <b>cladding</b> <b>mode</b> 28 th, 31 st, 35 th, 40 th, respectively, indicating the overall temperature sensitivity of Ex-TFGs were lower than that of normal FBGs.

40|$|The optical {{properties}} of the guided modes {{in the core of}} photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) can be easily manipulated by changing the air-hole structure in the cladding. Special properties can be achieved in this case such as endless singlemode operation. Endlessly single-mode fibers, which enable single-mode guidance over a wide spectral range, are indispensable in the field of fiber technology. A two-dimensional photonic crystal with a silica central core and a micrometer-spaced hexagonal array of air holes is an established method to achieve endless single-mode properties. In addition to the guidance of light in the core, different <b>cladding</b> <b>modes</b> occur. The coupling between the core and the <b>cladding</b> <b>modes</b> can affect the endlessly single-mode guides. There are two possible ways to determine the dispersion: measurement and calculation. We calculate the group velocity dispersion(GVD) of different <b>cladding</b> <b>modes</b> based on the measurement of the fiber structure parameters, the hole diameter and the pitch of a presumed homogeneous hexagonal array. Based on the scanning electron image, a calculation was made of the optical guiding {{properties of the}} microstructured cladding.

40|$|A simple {{mechanism}} {{useful to}} tailor the field profile in single mode optical fibers is proposed. It involves {{the local and}} permanent bend of the fiber with bending radius of few hundred micrometers.

The resultant sub-mm bend leads to a significant power coupling from the fundamental core <b>mode</b> to guided <b>cladding</b> <b>modes.</b> The order and number of the excited <b>cladding</b> <b>modes</b> depend on the geometrical features of the bent region, like angle and curvature rate. Also, since the light propagated by guided <b>cladding</b> <b>modes</b> interacts with the surrounding medium by evanescent wave, the field distribution can be additionally tailored by changing the refractive index of the medium surrounding the straight fiber region after the permanent bend. Here, the effects of permanent bend on the guided mode in single mode fiber is first theoretically introduced and then widely experimentally investigated.

Further, the transmission spectrum of the coated LPFG is investigated while the overlay thickness is located in mode transition and the surrounding region, the amplitude of attenuation peak of the <b>cladding</b> <b>mode</b> which will enter the overlay decreases rapidly and the peak position of adjacent higher <b>cladding</b> <b>mode</b> shift towards the former lower mode.

The dependency of selected <b>cladding</b> <b>mode</b> spectral parameters related with the twist measurement on the influence of temporary bending has been shown. The measurements were performed for two positions of sensing structure refractive index perturbations in relation to the bending direction plane. The experimental results show that the direction of TFBG structure bending has a small influence on the stability of spectral parameters characteristic for twist measurement, assuming that the bending direction is fixed while measurement...|$|R
