5|$|Manhunter {{focuses on}} the {{forensic}} work {{carried out by the}} FBI to track down killers and shows the long-term effects that <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> have on profilers such as Graham, highlighting the similarities between him and his quarry. The film features heavily stylized use of color to convey this sense of duality, {{and the nature of the}} characters' similarity has been explored in academic readings of the film. It was the first film adaptation of Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels, as well as the first adaptation of Red Dragon, which later became the basis for a film of the same name in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In October 1857 the inquisitor of Bologna, a Dominican friar called Father Pier Gaetano Feletti, {{learned of}} rumours {{to the effect}} that a secret baptism had been {{administered}} to one of the city's Jewish children by a Catholic servant. If true, this would make the child a Catholic {{in the eyes of the}} Church—a fact with secular as well as spiritual ramifications since the Church stance was that children they considered to be Christians could not be raised by non-Christians, and should be taken from their parents in such circumstances. <b>Cases</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> were not uncommon in 19th-century Italy, and often revolved around the baptism of a Jewish child by a Christian servant. The official Church position was that Catholics should not baptise Jewish children without the parents' consent, except if a child was on the brink of death—in these cases the Church considered the customary deferment to parental authority to be outweighed by the importance of allowing the child's soul to be saved and go to Heaven, and permitted baptism without the parents' assent. Many Jewish families feared clandestine baptisms by their Christian maids; to counter this perceived threat some households required Christians leaving their employment to sign notarised statements confirming that they had never baptised any of the children.|$|E

In <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> manufacturers specify correction factors for ripple current values at higher frequencies.

25|$|At nine on Thursday morning, April 9, 1931, {{the five}} {{defendants}} in Wednesday's trial were all found guilty. Roy Wright's jury {{could not agree}} on sentencing, and was declared a hung jury that afternoon. All the jurors agreed on his guilt, but seven insisted on the death sentence while five held out for life imprisonment (in <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> that was often {{an indication that the}} jurors believed the suspect was innocent but they were unwilling to go against community norms of conviction). Judge Hawkins declared a mistrial.|$|E
25|$|O'Connor did, however, {{state that}} the Court accepts certain forms of {{categorical}} presumptions of confidentiality. But these categorical presumptions {{are a lot more}} narrowly defined than what the FBI had previously used. Justice O'Connor gave the scenario of a paid informant as an example of an accepted categorical presumption of confidentiality. She stated that a paid informant can expect that his/her cooperation with the FBI will be kept secret, and that this makes documents related to a paid informant subject to being withheld or redacted in accordance with Exemption 7(D). She also stated that, in murder <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> one, informants may also expect to have their interactions with the FBI be confidential. Justice O'Connor said that the Court would accept the FBI's presumption of the confidentiality of any documents related to an informant for a murder case.|$|E
25|$|Some {{independent}} {{cities are}} still grouped with their former provinces {{for the purposes}} of representation in the Congress of the Philippines. While 24 independent cities have their own representative(s) in Congress, some still remain part of the congressional representation of the province to which they previously belonged: Butuan, for example, still forms part of the 1st Congressional District of Agusan del Norte. In <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> independent cities that do not vote for provincial officials are excluded from Sangguniang Panlalawigan (provincial council) districts, and the allotment of SP members is adjusted accordingly by COMELEC with proper consideration of population. For example, Agusan del Norte (being a third income-class province) is entitled to elect eight members to its Sangguniang Panlalawigan, and belongs to two congressional districts. The seats of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan are not evenly distributed (4-4) between the province's first and second congressional districts because its 1st Congressional district contains Butuan, an independent city which does not vote for provincial officials. Rather, the seats are distributed 1-7 to account for the small population of the province's 1st Sangguniang Panlalawigan district (consisting only of Las Nieves) and the bulk of the province's population being in the second district. On the other hand, the city of Lucena, which is eligible to vote for provincial officials, still forms part of the province of Quezon's 2nd Sangguniang Panlalawigan district, which is coterminous with the 2nd congressional district of Quezon.|$|E

500|$|Other {{commentators}} {{suggested the}} case will have broad-ranging impacts for other self-replicating technologies. Tabetha Marie Peavey suggested that the Court [...] "appeared to be alert to the consequences of its ruling, {{not just for the}} value of Monsanto’s soybean patents, but also for technologies like cell lines, software, and vaccines". Likewise, Christopher M. Holman wrote that the case [...] "should be viewed as a bellwether for an oncoming wave of controversy around the patenting of self-replicating technologies that will challenge the ability of the patent system to respond effectively". William J. Simmons also wrote that [...] "more <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> will probably be appealed to [...] as these technologies become more prevalent in society".|$|E
500|$|Black and Horn {{realize that}} the killer will have chosen the {{optician}} as his next victim, and agree to set another trap with her as the bait. Horn, more and more unhinged throughout the case, begins imagining the killer and his van at every turn. As he and Black wait for the killer to make an attempt on the optician's life, Horn admits that he cannot trust himself to be there, and is told to go home. However, he parks his car on the route towards the trap, feigning a flat tyre. When the killer's van attempts to pass, Horn attacks him, but the police arrive in time to stop him beating the killer to death. The attack renders any evidence found in the van inadmissible in court, although Black tells him enough evidence was found at the killer's home to secure a conviction. Later, Horn asks Black how he can deal with <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> on a regular basis. [...] Black does not answer, but later comforts his daughter after another bad dream.|$|E
500|$|Scholars have {{observed}} that Justice Kennedy's majority opinion [...] "embraced Bustamonte's premise that when police request consent to search, the request itself carries the implication that an alternative of refusal exists". Other scholars, such as Ric Simmons, have noted that Drayton reflects [...] "the Court at the midpoint of this evolution, moving from a subjective binary test that focuses {{on whether or not}} the subject acted voluntarily, to a more nuanced objective test that focuses on the amount of compulsion used by the law enforcement officer". Additionally, Matthew Phillips wrote that Drayton [...] "illustrates the metamorphosis of the totality-of-the-circumstances test into a purely objective test" [...] because Justice Kennedy's opinion [...] "did not explicitly consider any subjective factors" [...] with respect to whether Drayton and Brown felt they could deny consent when questioned by the police. Phillips suggested that the decision to abandon subjective factors could lead to [...] "bizarre results" [...] in <b>cases,</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> where [...] "circumstances of the search indicate at least some level of coercion".|$|E

500|$|Davis {{also noted}} the unusual {{situation}} in that [...] "a gang was involved and that two females were the sadistic leaders." [...] Following the convictions of Powell and McNeilly, there was wider press speculation about [...] "girl gangs" [...] {{and the rise}} in violent crime committed by young women, and [...] "the probation service and ex-offender organisations found themselves bombarded with requests from journalists seeking out case histories to illustrate this apparent explosion of LA-style girl-gang culture {{on the streets of}} Britain." [...] Mary Barnish, a senior probation officer at the Inner London Probation Service Women's Centre, dismissed the notion, saying: [...] "One woman does something somewhere and immediately there's a great moral panic. People think there's an epidemic of it." [...] However, statistics and research produced by the National Association of Probation Officers did show [...] "an {{increase in the number of}} women jailed for offences involving violence." [...] The association's assistant general secretary Harry Fletcher said that, like the women involved in the Capper murder, the group is [...] "characterised by neglect, personal abuse, drug or alcohol abuse and low self-esteem. Many have themselves been the victim of violence. The problem needs help rather than incarceration." [...] In one of the [...] "starkest signs of change" [...] there was evidence that [...] "in the 15—17 age group, girls are more likely to take pleasure in violence than boys, an indication we may face far more female violence in the future as these girls grow up." [...] Despite the focus on the female perpetrators around the time of the crime and trial Davis pointed out that, in <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> which involved female and male sadists, [...] "the female's role is invariably forgotten over time. This was apparent when Dudson's appeals were reported in the national press. Manchester newspapers named all of the killers involved, but most less-localised reports simply referred to the 'violent gang' he belonged to, and it probably wouldn't have occurred to newer readers that this gang included two merciless female sadists who thought that an allegedly stolen duffle coat was an excuse to torture someone to death." ...|$|E

2500|$|Isocyanates {{are very}} {{reactive}} materials. This makes them useful in making polymers but also requires special care in handling and use. [...] The aromatic isocyanates, diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) or toluene diisocyanate (TDI) are more reactive than aliphatic isocyanates, such as hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) or isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). Most of the isocyanates are difunctional, that {{is they have}} exactly two isocyanate groups per molecule. An important exception to this is polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate, which {{is a mixture of}} molecules with two, three, and four or more isocyanate groups. In <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> the material has an average functionality greater than two, commonly 2.7.|$|E
2500|$|The court {{dismissed}} the government's position {{that there could}} be no standing because the plaintiffs had not shown that their taxes were increased because general Congressional appropriations to the Executive branch were used to support the activities of the directors. They held that producing a proof that would show how many funds the plaintiffs would save if the situation was different was unnecessary in <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> one as [...] "the tangible harm would often be zero because if the complained-of expenditure was enjoined, the money would probably be used to defray some other public expense that would not benefit the taxpayer, rather than returned to him {{in the form of a}} lower tax rate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hutchinsonian niche framework, on {{the other}} hand, {{directly}} precludes the possibility of there being vacant niches.

In this {{we see that the}} operational definition of his niche rests on the fact that a species is needed in order to rationally define a niche in the first place. This fact didn't stop Hutchinson from making statements inconsistent with this such as: “The question raised by <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> is whether the three Nilghiri Corixinae fill all the available niches...or whether there are really empty niches.[...] [...]The rapid spread of introduced species often gives evidence of empty niches, but such rapid spread in many instances has taken place in disturbed areas.” Hutchinson (1957).|$|E
