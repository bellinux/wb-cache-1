40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{historical}} {{origins of the}} notion of incommensurability in contemporary philosophy of science. The aim is not to establish <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority,</b> but to enhance our understanding of the notion by illuminating the various issues that contributed to its development. Kuhn developed his notion of incommensurability under the influence of Fleck, Polanyi and Köhler. Feyerabend, who had developed his notion more than a decade earlier, drew directly from Duhem, who had developed a notion of incommensurability in 1906. The idea is that in the course of scientific advance, when fundamental theories change, meanings change, which can result in a new conception of the nature of reality. Feyerabend repeatedly used this notion of incommensurability to attack various forms of conceptual conservativism. These include the logical positivists’ foundational use of protocol statements, Heisenberg’s methodological principle that established results must be presupposed by all further research, attempts to separate philosophical accounts of ontology from physics, Bohr’s principle of correspondence, and logical empiricist accounts of reduction and explanation. Focusing on the function {{of the notion of}} incommensurability common to Feyerabend’s various critiques explicates Feyerabend’s early philosophy as a series of challenges to forms of conceptual conservativism.

When asked what equivariant cohomology is, most people would answer Bore 1 cohomology, namely H:(X) = H*(X,). This theory has the <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> and the merit of ready com-putability, and many very beautiful results have been proven with it. However, it suffers from the defects of its virtues. Precisely, it is ‘invariant’, {{in the sense that}} a G-map f: X + Y which is a nonequivariant homotopy equivalence induces an isomorphism on Bore 1 cohomology. A quick way to see this is to observe that 1 x f: EC xX+ EC x Y is a map of principal G-bundles with base map lxof=fo:Xo-‘Y,, so that fc is a weak homotopy equivalence. As explained in [l], this invariance property is the crudest of a hierarchy of such properties that a theory might have. We shall show how to compute all characteristic classes in any invariant equivariant cohomology theory, the conclusion being that no such theory is powerful enough to support a very useful theory of characteristic classes.
