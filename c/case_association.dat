It was determined that all affected individuals must have traits E, F and H (EFH phenotype) and they must also have either trait B (B subtype) or traits C, D, and G (CDG subtype). A genome screen was performed, and linkage peaks were identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 5, and 9 using microsatellite markers. Dense panels of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were ordered for each of the four linkage peaks. In each <b>case,</b> <b>association</b> analyses identified a single SNP that accounted for the linkage evidence. The SNP on chromosome 1 appeared to primarily influence the B subtype, while the SNPs on chromosomes 5 and 9 primarily influenced the CDG subtype. The chromosome 3 SNP had the strongest effect and influenced both subtypes, as well as the requisite EFH phenotype. Recognizing the two subtypes prior to linkage analysis was key to identifying these loci using only a single replicate.

40|$|Submicroscopic {{structural}} genomic variation includes {{copy number}} variation (CNV) {{that can result}} changes in DNA dosage, and the impacts can be observed on common disease, metabolism, and heritable traits such as colour vision and rhesus blood group. Human beta-defensins form a cluster of at least seven genes on human chromosome 8 p 23. 1, with a diploid copy number commonly ranging between 2 and 7 copies. They encode small secreted antimicrobial peptides with cytokine-like properties which are found expressed at high levels in psoriasis patients, and copy number at this locus {{has been found to}} be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly colonic Crohn’s disease. The focus of this thesis has been divided into two studies; looking for the origin of diversity at the human beta-defensins copy number, and development of a multiplex PRT measurement system for accurately typing the beta-defensin region in large <b>case</b> <b>association</b> study. The origin of diversity at the human beta-defensin copy number has been followed by using segregation in CEPH families. Three out of 416 meiotic transmissions changed the copy number by simple allelic recombination between two distinct loci for these genes. Deducing haplotype copy number from microsatellite and multiallelic length polymorphism have allowed this study to map the beta-defensin repeats in two locations at the original location distally REPD and about 5 Mb away at proximally REPP. We have demonstrated our multiplex PRT system is a powerful technique to determine the association of the beta-defensin genes in Crohn’s disease even though we did not produce any convincing support for associations reported from previous studies.

In {{view of the}} possible involvement of ZNF 804 A gene in early neurodevelopment and cellular processes including oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation, we examined the effect of ZNF 804 A on brainWM(WM) integrity in patients with SCZ. Based on extant data in healthy controls (HC), we hypothesized that ZNF 804 A risk variant rs 1344706 is associated with lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in brain regions within cortico-limbic circuits, namely frontal, parietal, medial temporal lobes, and cingulate gyri in SCZ. A total of 200 Chinese participants (125 patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of SCZ and 75 controls) were genotyped using blood samples, a subset of 153 participants (89 patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of SCZ and 64 controls) underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). There are significant effects of diagnosis (left cingulate gyrus: Adjusted F 1, 149 ¼ 9. 36, P¼ 0. 003) and diagnosis–genotype interactions (left parietal lobe: Adjusted F 1, 147 ¼ 7. 39, P¼ 0. 007; right parietal lobe: Adjusted F 1, 147 ¼ 6. 95, P¼ 0. 009; right medial temporal lobe: Adjusted F 1, 147 ¼ 8. 79, P¼ 0. 004; left cingulate gyrus: Adjusted F 1, 147 ¼ 8. 02, P¼ 0. 005).

40|$|The future heavy-ion {{experiment}} CBM (FAIR/GSI, Darmstadt, Germany) {{will focus}} on the measurements of very rare probes, which require the experiment to operate under extreme interaction rates of up to 10 MHz. Due to high multiplicity of charged particles in heavy-ion collisions, this will lead to the data rates of up to 1 TB/s. In order to meet the modern achievable archival rate, this data ow has to be reduced online by more than two orders of magnitude. The rare observables are featured with complicated trigger signatures and require full event topology reconstruction to be performed online. The huge data rates together with the absence of simple hardware triggers make traditional latency limited trigger architectures typical for conventional experiments inapplicable for the case of CBM. Instead, CBM will employ a novel data acquisition concept with autonomous, self-triggered front-end electronics. While in conventional experiments with event-by-event processing the association of detector hits with corresponding physical event is known a priori, it is not true for the CBM experiment, where the reconstruction algorithms should be modified in order to process non-event-associated data. At the highest interaction rates the time difference between hits belonging to the same collision will be larger than the average time difference between two consecutive collisions. Thus, events will overlap in time. Due to a possible overlap of events one needs to analyze time-slices rather than isolated events. The time-stamped data will be shipped and collected into a readout buffer in a form of a time-slice of a certain length. The time-slice data will be delivered to a large computer farm, where the archival decision will be obtained after performing online reconstruction. In this <b>case</b> <b>association</b> of hit information with physical events must be performed in software and requires full online event reconstruction not only in space, but also in time, so-called 4 -dimensional (4 D) track reconstruction.

The 4 D CA track finder is able to reproduce performance and speed of the traditional event-based algorithm. The 4 D CA track finder is both vectorized (using SIMD instructions) and parallelized (between CPU cores). The algorithm shows strong scalability on many-core systems.
