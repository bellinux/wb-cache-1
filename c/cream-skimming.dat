Also, even when separation is uncompleted, we show that a firm could still profitably <b>cream-skim</b> the market so that no pooling equilibrium exits.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the literature and current discussions on the European postal markets and the universal service obligations (USO). It consists of three independent chapters. In chapter one, we investigate the consumers' preferences for various kinds of postal services. As such, we begin by reviewing the market and regulatory conditions for Europe and for our case study, Belgium. Then using data provided by the incumbent provider, the Belgian post (Bpost), we estimate demand price elasticities. The data comprises customer transactional information on letter mail, direct mail, parcels & express services, press delivery and value added services for the 2008 - 2009 period. These categories constitute not only the important lines of services that Bpost offers to its clients but also the main segments that constitute the whole Belgian postal market. As such, and using standard methods, we estimate for each service an equation that explains demand by prices, product varieties (i. e. mixes or combinations of volume, weight, priority and destination, inter alia), income, regulation proxies and other socioeconomic variables. The estimated price elasticities for regulated and partially regulated services are around - 1. 1, whereas for unregulated segments they fluctuate between - 2. 1 and - 2. 8. The lowest price elasticity is obtained for direct mail services (- 1. 0); the highest ones are associated with value added services (- 2. 1) and registered mail (- 3. 3). Price elasticities may be influenced by the cyclical effects during the period of analysis. Therefore, elasticities are higher when compared with the empirical evidence obtained for other countries and through the various methodologies applied over the last decades. The fact that technological substitutes, such as expenditures on telephony and internet access for daily and administrative mail services and, radio and television advertising for direct mail services, could not be accounted for (because there were no data available) may however be considered as a major limitation for the scope of our results. In the second chapter, we explore theoretically the effects of the USO on unregulated markets. In particular, we are interested in investigating its welfare effects when the provision of services cannot be technologically separated. We present a model in which there is an incumbent who provides two services: a universal service and a non-USO service, the latter opened to competition. This is the case of letter mail and direct (or bulk) mail, services which have quite different purposes and regulatory frameworks (i. e. the former is fully regulated whereas the latter is liberalized under the current European Internal Market framework), but are jointly produce at some stages of the postal value chain. The USO is simplified to two dimensions, affordability and quality, implemented as a price cap and a minimum quality standard (MQS) for the provision of letter mail services. The latter involves the technological aspects that we are interested in. We find that the definition of the USO {{plays an important role in}} organizing markets that are open to competition. When it imposes few quality requirements (low MQS), the incumbent is not cost efficient enough to provide the high-quality variant of bulk mail, allowing its competitors to <b>cream-skim</b> the segment. However, because there are cost economies, the firm's participation in the segment yields a higher average quality of mail services at lower prices. When the USO is too comprehensive (high MQS), the incumbent exhibits large cost economies that ensure a dominant position in the provision of bulk mail services. Consumers are worse off as competition induces too much service differentiation in order to make profitable the provision. Relaxing the definition of the USO mitigates the competitive advantage of the USP and so, yields improvements in welfare. In the absence of access costs, firms will find profitable to participate in the bulk mail segment. However, foreclosure happens if the USO induces the incumbent to exhibit significant fixed costs. Therefore, the USP may end up as the sole supplier of bulk mail services if the definition of the USO imposes too many quality requirements (high MQS). In that case, the authority must balance the welfare gains of defining USO with the welfare losses of the consumers of the contested service. Finally, in the third chapter we consider the ownership aspect of the provision of universal services as an incentive to introduce competition. One can further segment the provision between services for customers located in high-cost areas and services for customers located in low-cost areas. Additionally, under the current EU legislation, the supply is divided between upstream activities (e. g. collection and sorting) and downstream activities (i. e. delivery). The provision of upstream activities in high-cost areas remains in hands of the incumbent firm or the owner of the downstream (delivery) network. The upstream provision in low-cost areas is open to competition, but a retailer may be vertically integrated/separated or legally unbundled with the downstream firm. Legal unbundling means, in our model, that the downstream firm and one upstream firm located in the low-cost area belong legally to the same entity entitled to all profits, whom does not have full control rights over the firms' decisions. That is to say, upstream activities and the downstream services will be managed separately under the same ownership. In this framework we analyze the firm's boundaries in terms of competition development and welfare. We implement two criteria to answer questions like, does vertical separation promotes competition (entry of firms) while covers a larger demand than vertical integration? Does vertical integration demand less public funds to cover demand? Does legal unbundling is worse than ownership separation to promote competition? The first criterion is the probability of entry (of the potential upstream firm), which we determine for each modes of ownership. The second criterion is the cost of public funds. It is implemented by defining a loss function as the difference between the expected consumer surplus when the downstream firm chooses an access fee that maximizes its profits and the consumer surplus when access is priced at marginal cost. The use of both criteria let us conclude that efficient entry occurs when the downstream firm is vertically separated or legally unbundled of the retailer providing services in the low-cost area. However, it is under legal unbundling that the access charge takes its lowest value. The highest cost of public transfers is obtained when firms are vertically separated, but the lowest one is attained when firms are legally unbundled. Therefore legal unbundling constitutes the preferred organizational form to induce competition and to reduce the cost of public funds.

Since “high quality ” families may have already sorted themselves, or may represent {{a small fraction of}} the total, this paper will examine whether existing within-school heterogeneity leaves any scope for <b>cream-skimming</b> to operate. The first empirical section shows that the assumptions made by simulation studies over-estimate within-school heterogeneity by at least 20 % to 40 %, thus inflating the <b>cream-skimming</b> effect. The second empirical section asks, “given the current level of within-school heterogeneity, how strong would peer effects have to be to significantly worsen outcomes for those left behind?”. In order for cream skimming to lower math test scores by a decile, the peer effect would have to be larger than the effect of converting both parents from college graduates to high-school dropouts. In order for cream skimming to substantially worsen dropout rates or college attendance rates, the peer effect would have to be two to three times larger than the strongest estimated predictor of these outcomes. The required peer effects would be smaller, but still unreasonably large, if family types started from a uniform distribution.

Using a utility-based simulation model, the insurance market {{is described as a}} composite of sub-markets. The latter are defined by the key parameters of risk, risk aversion and information levels on the insurer and on the consumer side. Numbers of contracts, revenue, adverse selection, <b>cream-skimming,</b> and profits indicate market performance. The impact of key parameters {{as well as that of}} scenarios describing risk and information changes linked with exclusion strategies are analysed. Especially when information levels are low, insurer information must be at least as good as that of the consumer in order to avoid significant losses by adverse selection. <b>Cream-skimming</b> varies by information and risk aversion. Insurer profits increase with the degree of risk dispersion and the market share of low risks. Scenario analyses show that profits may be highly sensitive to changes in key parameters, especially to those affecting <b>cream-skimming.</b> The simulation model explains performance in a wide range of market types and allows the impact of interventions such as marketing campaigns to be analysed. Profit-oriented insurers should aim to empirically understand the key parameters in the SPHI-markets in which they wish to operate. Policymakers in social health insurance who develop exclusion strategies should consider the potential performance of private markets if they intend to rely on supplementary coverage. 1...|$|E

In the second stage, the estimated propensity scores are used in the Battese and Coelli (1995) stochastic efficiency frontier specification. Although cost differences may also be caused by different product characteristics, our main finding is that the instrumental variable approach reveals that foreign ownership has a negative impact on cost efficiency.

We take advantage of variation in contract design over this period, where procured contracts gradually moved from partial performance-contingent pay to contracts with 100 %-performance contingent reward schemes, and analyze the impact of these changes using panel data that allow us to control for cohort types and to develop explicit measures of selection into the programs. We find evidence of <b>cream-skimming</b> and other gaming activities on the part of providers but little impact of these activities on job placement rates.

The {{performance standards}} system created under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) of 1982 is often cited as a successful prototype. Under the JTPA system, local training centers receive monetary rewards based on the employment levels and wage rates attained by their trainees upon completion of the program. Critics of the JTPA performance standards system argue that it creates an incentive for program managers to encourage case workers to `cream-skim' the most employable applicants into the program. We examine this issue by analyzing the determinants of acceptance into JTPA among applicants at a training center for which we have data on everyone who applied over a two year period. We find that case workers prefer to accept the least employable applicants, rather than the most employable as suggested by the <b>cream-skimming</b> story. This evidence indicates that concerns about <b>cream-skimming</b> in JTPA may be exaggerated. Instead, the performance standards system may operate as a countervailing force against the preferences of case workers. Using experimental data from the recent National JTPA Study, we also determine whether or not case workers accept those applicants with higher expected gains from the program.

40|$|Improving {{education}} quality {{is an important}} concern in many countries around the world. Over the last few decades, many governments have introduced market mechanisms in education with the objectives of enhancing choice and encouraging competition. In theory, increased competition between educational establishments should result {{in the provision of}} better quality education services to attract students. These reforms have given rise to fierce debates in political and scientific circles. ^ In the first chapter I study the mechanisms that underlie student sorting in a mixed public-private system using a 2008 education reform implemented in Chile aimed at decreasing education inequality. Specifically, I exploit the shock to schools’ incentives to test for whether schools select students based on socioeconomic characteristics. I show that low-SES parent’s school choices are restricted by private school <b>cream-skimming</b> behavior. I estimate a demand model incorporating these admission restrictions to capture parental preferences for different school characteristics and peer composition. I show that ignoring <b>cream-skimming</b> leads to underestimating poor parents 2 ̆ 7 preferences for school quality. I find that the decrease in <b>cream-skimming</b> induced by the reform led to lower public school enrollment and that strong preferences for high-income peers drove increased enrollment in schools that opted out of the reform. Overall, this led to increased segregation with higher impacts in markets with greater competition. ^ In the second chapter I study the consequences of increased competition and geographic differentiation resulting from the deregulation of the Chilean college market and the increase in government scholarships and loans. We study the effects of these changes in market characteristics on the efficiency of the higher education system and the accessibility and quality of colleges. We estimate a sorting model to account for vertical and horizontal dimensions of differentiation and quantify the quality of public and private colleges. We find that most of the growth in enrollment comes from elite institutions that expand the size of existing programs and private universities that almost doubled their enrollment {{and at the same time}} doubling on average the number of programs offered. We calculate substitution patterns for when a program increase its quality. We find significant substitution between middle tier programs, whereas top tier universities tend to substitute mainly from other programs in that same range. ...|$|E
