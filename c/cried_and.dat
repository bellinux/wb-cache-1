He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, <b>cried</b> <b>and</b> seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E

The Singapore National Pledge was recited by the mourners in honour of Rajaratnam, who penned down the National Pledge {{against the backdrop of}} racial riots in the 1950s and 1960s to inculcate in all Singaporeans his vision of building one united Singapore regardless of race, language or religion.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies in}} {{developmental}} psychology often implicitly presuppose that utterances {{can be divided}} into <b>cry</b> <b>and</b> non-cry utterances (e. g. Masataka, 1992). Our last study (Hayashibe, et al., 1996) hypothesizes that <b>cry</b> <b>and</b> non-cry utterances are the origins of the various functions of language like mand and tact (Skinner, 1957). Obviously we should have criteria to divide child's utterances into some classes including <b>cries</b> <b>and</b> non-cries. Thus we carried out an experiment in which a mother listened to her child's utterances and classified them into certain categories. The results indicate that the mother has a clear criterion to divide the utterances into three categories, i. e. vocalization, <b>cry</b> <b>and</b> faking <b>cry,</b> <b>and</b> that the duration and the pitch of utterances affect the mother's judgment...|$|R

Gan Ning sensed Ling Tong's intention so he also offered to perform with his pair of jis. Lü Meng realised that {{they were about to}} fight, so he drew his sword, carried a shield, and stood between the two men to separate them. When Sun Quan heard about the incident, he came to the banquet hall and everyone put down their weapons. When Sun Quan chided them for fighting, Ling Tong <b>cried</b> <b>and</b> knelt down. Sun Quan had to repeatedly urge him to stop provoking Gan Ning.|$|E
25|$|Also {{referred}} to as Natasha. Natasha is a seventeen-year-old daughter of Dar’ya Mikhailovna. She is observant, well-read and intelligent, but also quite secretive. While her mother thinks {{of her as a}} good-natured and well-mannered girl, she is not of a high opinion about her intelligence, and quite wrongly. She also thinks Natasha is ‘cold’, emotionless, but in the beginning of Chapter Five we are told by the narrator that “Her feelings were strong and deep, but reserved; even as a child she seldom <b>cried,</b> <b>and</b> now she seldom even sighed and only grew slightly pale when anything distressed her.” She engages in intellectual conversations with Rudin (which are not discouraged by her mother because she thinks that these conversations “improve her mind”); Natasha thinks highly of Rudin, who confides to her his ideas and “privately gives her books”, and soon falls in love with him. She also often compels him to apply his talents and act. Natasha is often thought of as the first of 'Turgenev maids' to feature in Turgenev's fiction.|$|E
25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter <b>cried</b> <b>and</b> her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E

40|$|Infant {{excessive}} <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> fussing {{has been}} linked to adverse maternal outcomes such as increased depression and stress, and decreased feelings of parenting self-efficacy. Infant crying has also been identified as the number one trigger caregivers report prior to an abusive action, placing infants who cry excessively at risk. Fathers and male caregivers have been identified as the primary offenders in the majority of infant abuse cases, suggesting a particular risk between fathers <b>and</b> infants who <b>cry</b> excessively. However, the relationship between excessive <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> fathers has not been explored to the same extent as mothers. In an effort to address the identified risks of infant <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> fathers, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate how fathers 2 ̆ 7 well-being is impacted by infant <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> fussing.

500|$|On Good Friday in March 2005, Veitch, Albee and {{six other}} women went to a strip club in Riverside and paid for lap dances. Instead of {{accepting}} the dances, they talked with the strippers, telling {{them that they were}} loved and accepted by God, that churches were composed entirely of sinners, and that they would be welcome there. One of the lap dancers <b>cried</b> <b>and</b> told Albee she had often wanted to go to a church but had never done so because she had thought that she would be rejected. The woman accepted a prayer from Albee and hugged her. Albee would later say that talking with women at the strip club that first day changed her life. Because the volunteers received more positive responses than they had expected, they decided to continue to evangelize at strip clubs. To organize these activities, Veitch and Albee founded JC's Girls, with [...] "JC" [...] standing for Jesus Christ.

500|$|In 1993, {{she won the}} National Film Award for Best Actress for her {{performance}} in Rudaali, a drama directed by Kalpana Lajmi. Kapadia played the central character of Shanichari, a lonely and hardened Assamese village woman who, throughout a lifetime of misfortune, has never <b>cried</b> <b>and</b> is now challenged with a new job as a professional mourner. The citation for the award described {{her performance}} as a [...] "compelling interpretation of the tribulations of a lonely woman ravaged by a cruel society". Chandra Bhushan said of her character, [...] "Shanichari is dry like a desert but even she has a flavour, affection and audacity and courage to reject the enticement of Zamindar (the landlord)." [...] Aside from a third Filmfare nomination for Best Actress for the role, she won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress, and was acknowledged with Best Actress honours at the Asia Pacific Film Festival and the Damascus International Film Festival. In 2010 Filmfare magazine included her work in the film in their list of [...] "80 Iconic Performances". Another Filmfare nomination for Kapadia came that year for her supporting role as Shanti, a street prostitute, in the Priyadarshan-directed drama Gardish.

The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film– all the stuff in the house– was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." [...] "Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why.

Canada, {{a case that}} began in the fall of 2010 when laws against keeping a brothel, communicating in order to facilitate prostitution, and living off the avails of prostitution were struck down by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice as unconstitutional. When Falle first heard about this decision, she <b>cried,</b> <b>and</b> expressed surprise and disappointment. She said that she did not believe that the average Canadian realized the implications of striking down these laws, which she said were that [...] "your next door neighbours can run a brothel right beside you. Your children could be exposed to condoms left on their driveway, johns propositioning them." [...] She also expressed her concern that striking down anti-prostitution laws normalizes prostitution as a career option for children to consider. She also said that, without the laws, [...] "pimps will be legitimate businesspeople [...] billboards advertising brothels could start appearing on roadsides." [...] Ron Marzel, a lawyer attempting to have the anti-prostitution laws declared unconstitutional, said, [...] "the reality is there are consenting adults who want to go into" [...] prostitution. Falle was angered by this statement, and replied that 97% of women in the sex industry are not engaging in prostitution by choice, and that [...] "the voices of the overwhelming majority of women who {{want to get out of}} prostitution are being drowned out by a vocal few." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} was universally panned by critics. Jeff Leeds of The New York Times said that [...] "no one {{was prepared for}} Sunday night’s fiasco, in which a listless Ms. Spears teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words in a wan attempt to lip-synch her new single". Vinay Menon of the Toronto Star commented Spears [...] "looked hopelessly dazed. She was wearing the expression of somebody who had been deposited at the Palms Casino Resort by a tornado, one that promptly twisted away, taking her clothing and sense of purpose. [...] lumbering, in slow motion, as if somebody had poured cement into her streetwalker boots". David Willis of BBC stated her performance would [...] "go down {{in the history books}} as being one of the worst to grace the MTV Awards". The day after the performance, American blogger Chris Crocker posted a video in YouTube titled [...] "Leave Britney alone!", in which he <b>cried</b> <b>and</b> defended Spears's performance, explaining {{that he did not want}} her to spiral out of control like Anna Nicole Smith, who had died in February 2007. Within the first 24 hours of its posting, the video accumulated over 2 million views. [...] "Leave Britney alone!" [...] turned Crocker into an internet celebrity, and was featured on television shows such as The View and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. It was also parodied by dozens of other YouTube users, most famously by actor Seth Green. An editor for YouTube said [...] "the melodramatic two-minute clip made Crocker an instant YouTube star" [...] and named it one of the top videos of 2007. Wired named it the top video of 2007.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{over a number}} of afternoons at the end of 2007, with each day's filming {{beginning}} with a repeat of the last section from the previous day, to help blend each scene into the next. It was filmed with a [...] "single camera mentality" [...] but with up to five cameras running to give Brown a [...] "freedom of performance away from hitting marks or favouring one particular camera position." [...] This also helped in the case of technical problems, meaning that second takes were not necessary. Brown cried when she read the script and though she did not cry during fiming, she had expected to, planning to pause the tape recorder if she did. She stated that {{the most difficult part of}} the script was the line about Jim being [...] "here, but not here" [...] because she felt that way about Bardon. Arnold admitted to [...] " [...] away the tears" [...] many times and noted that several other crew <b>cried,</b> <b>and</b> that one of the toughest things about it was that it mirrored real-life events. Brown found the episode easy to film due to the fact there were no other cast members to make mistakes, and because she [...] "knew the character backwards" [...] and [...] "exactly how she'd behave and what she'd feel and [...] her history." [...] She praised Arnold and the crew, stating that the episode was [...] "lovely" [...] to make and she felt [...] "very fortunate to be given the opportunity." [...] The performance was edited in post production after being committed to tape, where usually all scenes are vision mixed, and the usual EastEnders theme tune was replaced at the end of the episode with Tony Jackson's [...] "Pretty Baby".|$|E
