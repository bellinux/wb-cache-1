5|$|In some serpins, the S to R {{transition}} can activate <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> events. In these cases, a serpin {{that has}} formed a complex with its target protease, is then recognised by a receptor. The binding event then leads to downstream signalling by the receptor. The S to R transition is therefore used to alert cells {{to the presence of}} protease activity. This differs from the usual mechanism whereby serpins affect signalling simply by inhibiting proteases involved in a signalling cascade.|$|E
5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{basis for}} the toxicity of oxygen is the partial reduction of oxygen by one or two electrons to form reactive oxygen species, which are natural by-products of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in <b>cell</b> <b>signalling.</b> One species produced by the body, the superoxide anion (−), is possibly involved in iron acquisition. Higher than normal concentrations of oxygen lead to increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Oxygen is necessary for cell metabolism, and the blood supplies it to {{all parts of the}} body. When oxygen is breathed at high partial pressures, a hyperoxic condition will rapidly spread, with the most vascularised tissues being most vulnerable. During times of environmental stress, levels of reactive oxygen species can increase dramatically, which can damage cell structures and produce oxidative stress.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which different types of flow patterns and other physical cues have different effects on vascular remodelling in the embryo is called mechanotransduction. It is known that turbulent flow, which is commonplace in the developing vasculature, {{plays a role in}} the formation of cardiac valves which prevent backflows associated with turbulence. It has also been shown that heterogeneous flow patterns in large vessels can create asymmetry, perhaps by preferentially activating genes such as PITX2 {{on one side of the}} vessel, or perhaps by inducing circumferential stretch on one side, promoting regression on the other side. Laminar flow also has genetic effects, such as reducing apoptosis, inhibiting proliferation, aligning cells in direction of flow, and regulating many <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> factors. Mechanotransduction may act either by positive or negative feedback loops, which may activate or repress certain genes to respond to the physical stress or strain placed on the vessel.|$|E
25|$|Amastigotes of L. donovani enter macrophages via a Rac1- and Arf6-dependent process, and {{are found}} in {{phagocytic}} vacuoles that interact with endosomes and lysosomes and acquire lysosomal features. During phagocytosis by macrophages, the promastigotes inhibit {{the formation of the}} phagolysosome, a cellular product by which invading pathogens are removed. The promastigote can do this using its glycolipid lipophosphoglycan (LPG) on its cell membrane. LPG causes disorganisation of F-actin and disruption of phagosomal lipid microdomains. They are capable of evading the microbicidal actions of macrophages, which can kill ordinary pathogens using reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates. They effectively subvert the production of reactive oxygen species. In this way the amastigotes are able to survive and replicate inside these primary immune systems. The parasites manipulate the <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> pathway of the macrophages, such as down-regulating of Jak/stat signalling, NO and TNF-α production, and also by blocking the NF-κB-dependent pathway. There are two major mechanisms of immune evasion such as induction of immune suppressive IL-10 responses and the generation of poor and functionally impaired CD8(+) T-cell responses.|$|E

2500|$|By {{looking at}} the genome of the Choanoflagellate, [...] "Monosiga brevicollis", {{scientists}} have inferred that choanoflagellates {{play a key role}} in the development of multicellularity. Nicole King has done work {{looking at the}} genome of Monisiga brevicollis, and has found key protein domains that are shared between metazoans and choanoflagellates. These domains play a role in <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> and adhesion processes in metazoans. The finding that choanoflagellates also have these genes is an incredible discovery because it was previously thought that only metazoans had genes responsible for cell-cell communication and aggregation. This suggests that these domains {{play a key role in}} the origins of multicellularity since it ties a unicellular organism (choanoflagellates) to multicellular organisms (metazoans).

2500|$|Free {{radicals}} play {{an important}} role in a number of biological processes. [...] Many of these are necessary for life, such as the intracellular killing of bacteria by phagocytic cells such as granulocytes and macrophages. Researchers have also implicated free radicals in certain <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> processes, known as redox signaling. [...] Some of these signaling molecules involve the free radical-induce peroxidation of tissue stores of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. [...] For example, free radical attack of linoleic acid produces a series of 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids and 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids which may act to regulate localized tissue inflammatory and/or healing responses, pain perception, and the proliferation of malignant cells. Free radical attacks on arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid produce a similar but broader array of signaling products.|$|E
2500|$|The protein {{ubiquitin}} is a universal, [...] "" [...] {{expressed protein}} common to eukaryotic organisms. Ubiquitin {{plays a role}} in the regulation of other proteins by tagging them for eventual degradation by proteasomes. This process begins when ubiquitin ligase covalently attaches a ubiquitin molecule to the lysine side chain of the target protein substrate (the misfolded, damaged, malfunctioning or unneeded protein that needs to be degraded). This is repeated a number of times in succession forming a chain of ubiquitin molecules, which is a process referred to as polyubiquitination. The polyubiquitination of the target protein signals the proteasome to break it down, which it does via proteolysis. The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays {{a crucial role in the}} non-lysosomal degradation of intracellular proteins, and ubiquitin can also participate in modifying proteins to perform certain tasks. Both degradation and modification of proteins within the cell are part of a broader regulatory scheme, necessary for cellular processes such as cell division, <b>cell</b> <b>signalling,</b> cell surface receptor function, apoptosis, DNA maintenance, inflammatory response and [...] developmental quality control associated with the cell cycle and homeostasis in general.|$|E
