5|$|The Country Wife {{was first}} {{performed}} in January 1675, by the King's Company, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. This luxurious playhouse, designed by Christopher Wren and with room for 2,000 spectators, had opened only the year before. It was of <b>compact</b> <b>design,</b> retaining {{in spite of}} its large seating capacity much of the intimate actor/audience contact of the Elizabethan theatre, still with an almost Elizabethan-size forestage or apron stage, on which actors would come forward for maximum audience contact.|$|E

25|$|Various {{other types}} of {{converter}} have been proposed, combining features of the two-level and Modular Multi-Level Converters. These hybrid VSC systems aim to achieve the low losses and high harmonic performance of the MMC with a more <b>compact</b> <b>design</b> and greater controllability, but these concepts are still at the research stage.|$|E
25|$|The Wankel engine has the {{advantages}} of <b>compact</b> <b>design</b> and low weight over {{the most commonly used}} internal combustion engine employing reciprocating pistons. These advantages have given rotary engine applications in a variety of vehicles and devices, including: automobiles, motorcycles, racing cars, aircraft, go-karts, jet skis, snowmobiles, chainsaws, and auxiliary power units. The point of power to weight has been reached of under one pound weight per horsepower output.|$|E
25|$|The F2002 was {{not only}} a {{development}} of the championship-winning Ferrari F2001, but a completely revolutionary model involving many technologies not seen previously. Since the late 1990s Ferrari had been using the same basic concept and design of gearbox and although this had been used to win drivers and constructors titles from 1999 onwards the technical team pushed ahead with a new version instead. The new replacement gearbox casing was made of ultra lightweight and higher strength titanium, thus reducing its weight by as much as 15% and lowering the car's centre of gravity. The new <b>compact</b> <b>design</b> allowed for great advancement in the bodywork and increasing the car's aerodynamic efficiency at the rear.|$|E

50|$|The C20 {{workstation}} was <b>compact,</b> <b>designed</b> {{to be easy}} {{to mount}} on a rack. This compact size allowed up to 14 workstations to be stacked in a standard 42U rack. It also meant that users who used a single workstation were offered extra space either on or beneath their desk.|$|R
25|$|In 1997 the lithium polymer battery was {{released}} by Sony and Asahi Kasei. These batteries hold their electrolyte in a solid polymer composite instead of in a liquid solvent, and the electrodes and separators are laminated to each other. The latter difference allows the battery to be encased in a flexible wrapping instead of in a rigid metal casing, which means such batteries can be specifically shaped to fit a particular device. This advantage has favored lithium polymer batteries {{in the design of}} portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants, and of radio-controlled aircraft, as such batteries allow for more flexible and <b>compact</b> <b>design.</b> They generally have a lower energy density than normal lithium-ion batteries.|$|E
25|$|In {{the single}} toggle jaw crushers, the swing jaw is {{suspended}} on the eccentric shaft {{which leads to}} a much more <b>compact</b> <b>design</b> than that of the double toggle jaw crusher. The swing jaw, suspended on the eccentric, undergoes two types of motion- swing motion towards the fixed jaw due to the action of toggle plate and vertical movement due the rotation of the eccentric. These two motions, when combined, lead to an elliptical jaw motion. This motion is useful as it assists in pushing the particles through the crushing chamber. This phenomenon leads to higher capacity of the single toggle jaw crushers but it also results in higher wear of the crushing jaws. These type of jaw crushers are preferred for the crushing of softer particles.|$|E
25|$|BMT-72 – Ukrainian T-72 upgrade. The unique <b>compact</b> <b>design</b> of the Ukrainian-developed BMT-72 power pack, {{based on}} that of the T-84, made it {{possible}} not only to considerably increase the power capabilities of the vehicle, but also to introduce into the vehicle design a troop compartment. The troop compartment is located between the fighting compartment and the power pack compartment. In the troop compartment roof there {{is a set of}} three hatches in slightly raised portion of the hull roof behind turret that allow the troops to get in or dismount the vehicle. There are also steps on the end of each catwalk at rear of vehicle. The main visual difference between BMT-72 and T-72 is a seventh pair of roadwheels.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} an {{analysis}} of the digital hardware implementation of two stream ciphers proposed for the eSTREAM project: Salsa 20 and Phelix. Both high speed and <b>compact</b> <b>designs</b> are examined, targeted to both field programmable (FPGA) and application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) technologies. The studied designs are specified using the VHDL hardware description language, and synthesized by using Synopsys CAD tools. The throughput of the <b>compact</b> ASIC <b>design</b> for Phelix is 260 Mbps targeted for 0. 18 µ CMOS technology and the corresponding area is equivalent to about 12, 400 2 -input NAND gates. The throughput of Salsa 20 ranges from 38 Mbps for the <b>compact</b> FPGA <b>design,</b> implemented using 194 CLB slices to 4. 8 Gbps for the high speed ASIC design, implemented with an area equivalent to about 470, 000 2 -input NAND gates. 1...|$|R

25|$|Although the Boeing design {{had been}} the first to enter series production, the 247 proved to have some serious design deficiencies. Air {{carriers}} considered its limited capacity a drawback since it carried only ten passengers, in five rows with a seat {{on each side of the}} aisle, as well as a flight attendant. Compared to the more spacious DC-2 and later DC-3, the passenger count was too few to make it a commercially viable airliner. Another feature influencing passenger comfort was that the 247's main wing spar ran through the cabin, so persons moving through the cabin had to step over it. The Lockheed Model 10 Electra had a similar configuration and while it was a more <b>compact</b> <b>design,</b> the Electra managed to carry the same number of passengers at a slightly better overall performance, and more importantly, at a lower cost-per-mile.|$|E
25|$|It first flew in 1951, and {{although}} 200 units were planned, only 65 were ever built. The Hispano engine was an upright V12 {{in contrast to}} the inverted V12 Daimler-Benz DB 601 & 605 engines used in the Bf 109. Being of <b>compact</b> <b>design,</b> it fitted the airframe of the Bf 109 well, representing it in the German 1957 film Der Stern von Afrika (The Star of Africa) about Luftwaffe ace Hans-Joachim Marseille. In the original design, an asymmetric vertical fin with an airfoiled profile had been introduced starting with the Bf 109F to produce a slight left movement of the tail, which counteracted the left-side torque reaction from the Daimler-Benz engine's counterclockwise rotation. Since this was left unchanged in the Buchón, and the Hispano V12 powered a clockwise-turning propeller instead, the combination of the airfoiled fin and the clockwise-turning propeller created a hard-to-counteract right swing on takeoff, since the fin and the propeller essentially worked in the same direction.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors that have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very <b>compact</b> <b>design</b> if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices, such as food mixers and power tools, that are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor {{can be used to}} agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{monoplane}} supplanted the biplane in {{the late}} 1930s, virtually all fixed-wing aircraft designed for shipboard duty have been equipped with folding wings. Notable exceptions include the SBD Dauntless, F2A Buffalo, and A4D/A-4 Skyhawk (all USN types), the Mitsubishi A5M, and Yokosuka D4Y (Japanese), and the Sea Harrier (British).

500|$|The {{device was}} {{released}} to mostly positive reception; the G2 was universally praised for LG's efforts {{to produce a}} more seamless and <b>compact</b> <b>design,</b> its high performance, {{the quality of its}} display and camera, along with its long-lasting battery. Critics were divided on certain aspects of its design, such as its rear button layout, and its plastic chassis—which was panned for closely resembling recent Samsung Galaxy products and being a regression from the glass-based chassis of the Optimus G. Similarly, while its software and user interface was praised for its usability and large number of customization options, some reviewers felt that the software suffered from feature creep and contained notable usability regressions in comparison to [...] "stock" [...] Android.|$|E
500|$|The {{need for}} {{multi-band}} antennae arises with mobile devices {{that need to}} roam between countries and networks where the frequency bands used can often be different. [...] Perhaps the most conceptually simple design, first reported in 1997, is to nest two PIFA patch antennae one inside the other. [...] Another technique is to insert one or more spur lines into the patch, which {{has the effect of}} coupled resonators broadening the band. [...] Other techniques rely on multiple modes being generated, which makes for a more <b>compact</b> <b>design.</b> [...] Examples of this are the C-slot pattern, which is a similar pattern to the interdigital filter, and the tightly meandered pattern shown as, respectively, C and D in the diagram.|$|E
