5|$|It {{has been}} found that urban populations of common toad occupying small areas and {{isolated}} by development show a lower level of genetic diversity and reduced fitness as compared to nearby rural populations. The researchers demonstrated this by genetic analysis and by noting the greater number of physical abnormalities among urban as against rural tadpoles when raised in a <b>controlled</b> <b>environment.</b> It was considered that long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population persistence in such urban environments.|$|E

Each diorama holds a carefully <b>controlled</b> <b>environment</b> that features select animals. These central displays broadly relate animals to their surrounds. Exhibits featuring more specific biota branch off from the central foyer. Side exhibits center on cotton-top tamarins, meerkats, emerald tree boas, dwarf mongooses, desert monitors, among others.

5|$|Until recently, {{red deer}} and elk were {{considered}} to be one species, Cervus elaphus. However, mitochondrial DNA studies, conducted on hundreds of samples in 2004 from red deer and elk subspecies as well as other species of the Cervus deer family, strongly indicate that elk, or wapiti, should be a distinct species, namely Cervus canadensis. The previous classification had over a dozen subspecies under the C. elaphus species designation; DNA evidence concludes that elk are more closely related to Thorold's deer and even sika deer than they are to the red deer. Though elk and red deer can produce fertile offspring in captivity, geographic isolation between the species in the wild and differences in mating behaviors indicate that reproduction between them outside a <b>controlled</b> <b>environment</b> would be unlikely. However, the two species have freely inter-bred in New Zealand's Fiordland National Park, where the cross-bred animals have all but removed the pure elk blood from the area.|$|E
