40|$|Abstract — The lifting {{structure}} {{has been shown}} to be computationally efficient for implementing filter banks. The hardware implementation of a filter bank requires that the lifting coefficients be quantized. The quantization method determines compression performance, hardware size, hardware speed and energy. We investigate the implementation of two lifting <b>coefficient</b> <b>sets,</b> rational and irrational, for the biorthogonal 9 / 7 wavelet. Six different approaches are used to find optimal quantized lifting <b>coefficients</b> from these <b>sets.</b> We find that the best hardware and PSNR performance is obtained using the rational <b>coefficient</b> <b>set</b> quantized with gain compensation and lumped scaling.

30|$|Wavelet {{transforms}} (WT) [11] based {{image analysis}} {{is a valuable}} tool for image enhancement since {{it can be used}} to highlight scale-specific or sub-band specific image features. In addition, these features remain localized in space, thus many spatial domain image enhancement techniques can be adapted for the WT domain. The WT domain contrast enhancement algorithms can be divided into manipulating the detail <b>coefficient</b> <b>sets</b> or the approximation <b>coefficient</b> <b>sets</b> that result from WT decomposition. The latter manipulation mainly applies global histogram equalization to the approximation <b>coefficient</b> <b>sets</b> and then adds back the image's small-scale high frequency features. Resulting from the phenomenon that the background gray-level concentrates in low intensity, this approach will degrade the image contrast. In order to enhance the intensity difference around the boundaries of the target, an edge-confined wavelet enhancement filter [10] is applied. To achieve this goal, edge detector is first applied on the image to extract the edges and then the wavelet enhancement is selectively applied on the edges near the target boundaries.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{first we}} {{investigate}} {{the principle of}} finding the optimized <b>coefficient</b> <b>set</b> of IntFFT. IntFFT has been regarded as an approximation of original FFT computation since it utilizes lifting scheme and decomposes the complex multiplication of twiddle factor into three lifting steps. Based on the observation of the quantization loss model of lifting operations, we can select an optimized <b>coefficient</b> <b>set</b> and achieve better SQNR and reduce size of coefficient table. Secondly, we analyze the fixed-point effect of arithmetic quantization errors for different FFT algorithms. A general analytic expression is derived to quantitatively compare the overall quantization loss. An operational optimization procedure is also proposed to find the optimal memory setting for short-length FFT architecture. Last, a parallel VLSI architecture based on mixed-radix IntFFT for the upcoming MB-OFDM system is proposed. The periodicity property of lifting coefficients and the concurrent relationship of non-trivial multiplications are both utilized to reduce the hardware cost of complex multiplier...|$|R

The main {{difference between the two}} is that electrical filters act on functions of one variable (time), whereas the geophysical tilters must act on functions of the two space variables (x and y). This paper develops linear filter theory for gravity and magnetic interpreta-tion. As an application of the theory! downward continuation is discussed in some detail. The fre-quency response of upward continuatron is an exponential function decreasing with increasing fre-quency. The inverse process of downward continuation has a frequency response which is the re-ciprocal of the upward continuation response.

40|$|Real-time {{manipulation}} {{of objects in}} micro flows is important due to an ever increasing interest in demanding medical applications. Specialized swimming micro robots are expected to perform minimal invasive surgery consisting of various in vivo tasks. Moreover, fluid forces exerted on moving surfaces are crucial for maneuverability if swimming micro robotic tools are ever to {{play a key role}} in therapeutic applications. Hydrodynamic forces acting on an isolated object of regular blunt shapes immersed in micro flows are calculated by resistive force coefficients based on the Stokes Flow approximation derived by analytical means. However, force coefficients presented in literature often lack the accuracy to predict the hydrodynamic interactions between rotating and translating objects of irregular shapes, and rigid concave surfaces such as a rigid helix moving inside a cylindrical channel. In this study a set of parameterized 3 D CFD simulations are carried out using a novel geometric representation for rigid helical tails of varying sizes and of varying distances with respect to the wall of a cylindrical channel. Furthermore, the complex rigid-body motion of the helix is represented by a series of simple translations and rotations. Each simulation is governed by Stokes equations and carried out by a commercial CFD package. A generic resistive force <b>coefficient</b> <b>set</b> is obtained via surface-fit procedures based on the hydrodynamic forces computed by the CFD simulations along the tangential, normal and binormal directions on the moving and rotating helical surface. Finally, using a reduced-order microhydrodynamic model, the proposed <b>coefficient</b> <b>set</b> is validated with empirical data collated using bio-inspired cm-scale robots autonomously swimming in a cylindrical channel filled with silicone oil of high viscosity.
