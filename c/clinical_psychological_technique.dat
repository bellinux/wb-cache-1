Scholars in this tradition have had their primary training in anthropology or psychiatry (or rarely both) and have conducted ethnographic fieldwork strongly informed by psychodynamic theories (though not necessarily orthodox Freudian theory), some degree of training in psychiatric or <b>clinical</b> <b>psychological</b> interviewing <b>techniques,</b> and attention {{to a set of}} issues including the role of culture in or the cross-cultural study of emotions, sexuality, identity, the experience of self, and mental health. Figures in this larger tradition include but are not limited to: Jean Briggs, George Devereux, Cora DuBois, A. Irving Hallowell, Abram Kardiner, Ralph Linton, Melford Spiro, and at least tangentially Gregory Bateson, Margaret Mead, and Marvin Opler.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that <b>psychological</b> <b>techniques</b> may facilitate injured athletes' rehabilitation, yet {{little is known about}} the <b>psychological</b> <b>techniques</b> trainers currently employ and how they view these interventions. In this study, 206 athletic trainers assigned Likert scale ratings to 11 <b>psychological</b> <b>techniques</b> indicating how much they valued a specific technique, how skillfully they employed it, and how often they utilized it. Trainers also responded to an open ended question asking how they would deal with the psychological aspects of an injury described in a short scenario. Results revealed a tentative model for the way trainers view <b>psychological</b> <b>techniques.</b> Categories of techniques included techniques involving the modification of physical and psychological states (goal setting, pain management, relaxation, imagery, and breathing techniques), techniques involving verbal cognitive techniques (communicating openly, changing negative self talk, emotional counseling, and crisis counseling), and non-recommended techniques (encouraging heroism and screening negative information). The study explored trainers' perceptions of each of the 11 <b>psychological</b> <b>techniques</b> in depth and discussed these findings. The study found that although trainers highly value psychological interventions in their work with injured athletes, they assigned low ratings to the techniques they knew little about. However, as exposure to sport psychology information increased, ratings assigned to the techniques that modify physical and psychological states also increased. Similarly, the longer trainers had worked in their field, the more highly they valued the verbal cognitive interventions. In contrast, neither exposure to sport psychology information or athletic training experience proved predictive of ratings assigned to the non-recommended <b>psychological</b> <b>techniques.</b> These findings suggest the importance of introducing skills training for <b>psychological</b> <b>techniques</b> early in the athletic trainers' educational curriculum so that trainers can gain awareness of the efficacy of certain <b>psychological</b> <b>techniques</b> and skill at using these techniques. Moreover, trainers could benefit from course work explaining potential negative consequences of employing harmful or ineffectual psychological interventions...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To analyze <b>clinical</b> <b>psychological</b> nursing {{research}} hotspots in China and variation {{trends in}} order to provide reference points on the current state of development of <b>clinical</b> <b>psychological</b> nursing and future research hotspots. Method: <b>Clinical</b> <b>psychological</b> nursing research literature sourced from Wanfang Data for the three periods of 2007 â 2009, 2010 â 2012, and 2013 â 2015 were selected as the research sample. A bibliographic co-occurrence analysis system (BICOMB software) was used to perform keyword word frequency analysis and generate a keyword co-occurrence matrix. In addition, Ucinet software's Netdraw tool was used to create visualized network diagrams. Results: A total of 27890 articles were retrieved, and word frequency analysis revealed that the highest-frequency keywords consisted of anxiety, depression, the elderly, expectant women, coronary heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, perioperative period, quality of life, and psychological intervention. Research hotspot analysis revealed that consistent hotspots comprised anxiety, depression, health education, and perioperative period; expectant women became a hotspot during 2010 â 2012, and quality of life and efficacy became hotspots during 2013 â 2015. Conclusions: In addition to the care process, <b>clinical</b> <b>psychological</b> nursing research hotspots in China have increasingly included the effectiveness of psychological nursing and impact on patient quality of life. In addition, research hotspots have been influenced by the incidence of illnesses and people's health consciousness.

The multivariate results support the key role of personal, structural, and medical resources in understanding psychological distress among MLHIV. Interventions that can support the psychological health of MLHIV are discussed...|$|R
