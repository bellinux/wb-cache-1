The experience formulas for the unconfined compressive strength prediction of cement stabilized/solidified heavy metal <b>contaminated</b> <b>soils</b> are studied. The strength data used for analysis are from unconfined compressive tests conducted in the laboratory. The heavy metal <b>contaminated</b> <b>soils</b> are prepared artificially by adding lead nitrate as a source of pollutant at four different lead contents of 1. 0 × 102, 1. 0 × 103, 1. 0 × 104 and 3. 0 × 104 mg/kg (dry soil weight basis) and three different cement contents 5 %, 7. 5 % and 10 %. The results of the unconfined compressive strength tests show that there is a linear relationship between the strength of cement treated lead <b>contaminated</b> <b>soils</b> at different curings, and a power function relationship between the cement content ratios and the ration of strength corresponding to the cement content. The experience formulas are further concluded which can predict the strengths at different curing times or with different cement content.

However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters.

The results indicated that DDT level in the <b>contaminated</b> <b>soils</b> {{was significantly higher than}} that in the reference soils with similar level of other pollutants and soil characters. The mortality, growth inhibition rates, GST and CST activities of earthworms exposed to the <b>contaminated</b> <b>soils</b> were significantly higher than that in reference soils. The contribution of historical DDT in <b>contaminated</b> <b>soils</b> to earthworms was confirmed by the DDT spiked tests. DDT spiked in soils at rates of higher than 200 mg. kg(- 1) was significantly toxic to both the survival and the growth of earthworms. DDT significantly stimulated GST and CAT activity in earthworms after 14 days. The CAT and GST activities were also stimulated by DDT exposure at rates of 100 mg. kg(- 1) after chronic exposure (42 days).
