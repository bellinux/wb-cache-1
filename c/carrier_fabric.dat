Highly flexible polymeric optical fibres (POFs) that react to applied pressure were {{integrated into a}} <b>carrier</b> <b>fabric</b> to form a wearable sensing system.

To demonstrate the feasibility of such a wearable sensor, the setup featuring the best performance {{was placed on the}} human torso, and thus it was possible to measure the respiratory rate. Furthermore, we show that such a wearable system enables {{to keep track of the}} way of breathing (diaphragmatic, upper costal and mixed) when the sensor is placed at different positions of the torso.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an innovative carbon nanotube-based non-woven composite sensor that can be tailored for strain sensing properties and potentially offers a reliable and cost-effective sensing option for structural health monitoring (SHM). This novel strain sensor is fabricated using a readily scalable process of coating Carbon nanotubes (CNT) onto a nonwoven <b>carrier</b> <b>fabric</b> to form an electrically-isotropic conductive network. Epoxy is then infused into the CNT-modified fabric to form a free-standing nanocomposite strain sensor. By measuring the changes in the electrical properties of the sensing composite the deformation can be measured in real-time. The sensors are repeatable and linear up to 0. 4 % strain. Highest elastic strain gage factors of 1. 9 and 4. 0 have been achieved in the longitudinal and transverse direction, respectively. Although the longitudinal gage factor of the newly formed nanocomposite sensor is close to some metallic foil strain gages, the proposed sensing methodology offers spatial coverage, manufacturing customizability, distributed sensing capability as well as transverse sensitivity...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a textile-based sensing {{principle}} for long term photopletysmography (PPG) monitoring is presented. Optical fibers were embroidered into textiles such that out-coupling and in-coupling of light was possible. The "light-in light-out" {{properties of the}} textile enabled the spectroscopic characterization of human tissue. For the optimization of the textile sensor, three different <b>carrier</b> <b>fabrics</b> and different fiber modifications were compared. The sample with best light coupling efficiency was successfully used to measure heart rate and SpO 2 values of a subject. The latter was determined by using a modified Beer-Lambert law and measuring the light attenuation at two different wavelengths (632 nm and 894 nm). Moreover, the system was adapted to work in reflection mode which makes the sensor more versatile. The measurements were additionally compared with commercially available system and showed good correlation...|$|R

40|$|Fibre {{entanglement}} {{provides the}} structural integrity in mechanically-bonded nonwovens by frictional restraints, {{such as that}} produced by hydro entanglement. Unlike many nonwoven assemblies, fibre segment orientations occur in three dimensions {{and this is a}} defining parameter of the structure of mechanically-bonded nonwovens. Hydroentangled fabrics can be produced in single- and multi-layer configurations. This study aims to characterise the dimensional, mechanical and structural characteristics of bi-layer hydroentangled <b>carrier</b> <b>fabric.</b> A 2 ⁴ full-factorial experimental design was followed to study the effect of four key hydro entangling process variables (water jet pressure, conveyor speed, nozzle diameter and number of injectors) on fabric structure and properties. Fabric tensile properties were characterized in three principal directions (machine-, cross- and thickness-direction) and linked to process variables by analysis of covariance. The regression models were constructed for key properties and an approach to select process variables for minimal consumption of specific energy was presented. An adapted testing method was developed for the characterisation of fabric tensile strength in the thickness-direction. Difficulties in applying standard methods of measuring resistance to delamination occurred {{because of the nature of}} inter-layer bonding in hydroentangled fabrics, where there is an absence of a discrete interface between two layers. The developed testing method was found suitable for a variety of nonwoven structures. The subject of fibre orientation distribution in nonwovens has generally been limited to in-plane characterisation but out-of-plane orientations cannot be ignored in mechanically-bonded assemblies. Based on an existing algorithm, fibre segment orientation distribution was determined in- and out-of-plane. The results were validated by physical testing of key dry-laid structures (parallel-, cross- and air-laid), followed by extension to selected bi-layer materials from the 2 ⁴ design to determine the relationships between process, structure and properties. Topological methods were utilised for direct and non-destructive estimation of fibre entanglement. An algorithm was presented to calculate splitting number which in relation to the total number of fibre crossings enabled an estimate of the degree of fibre entanglement. The approach was successfully demonstrated on simulated nonwovens assemblies and a preliminary investigation using real assemblies was also carried out.

40|$|This Thesis {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of replacing, in small craft and recreative boats, {{some of the more}} traditionally made joints (using tabbing) with ones made using structural adhesives (adhesive used where the load applied may cause the separation of the adherends [2]), which have the potential to be quicker to produce and have good fatigue resistance. It also focuses on methods that are available to a small and medium size boatbuilding or boat design company in order to design and produce a general safe, light weight adhesive joint. Several static tests were conducted in order to identify the characteristics of the materials to be joined and the properties of the adhesives investigated. A summary of the analytical theories available {{in order to determine the}} characteristics of the joints are presented and compared, and several finite element models have been investigated in order to determine the suitability of this method when using adhesive materials. This Thesis focuses first on Single-Lap joints, not only as a joint, but also as a way to compare the characteristics of the adhesives to be used. Three types of adhesives have been tested, two commercially available (Plexus MA 550 and Sikaflex 252) and one commonly found on boatbuilding yards, a mixture of vinyl ester and Epiglass HT 120 (a silica based filler). It was found that the Plexus MA 550 adhesive performed well across different substrates (aluminium and composites) followed closely in performance by the vinyl ester/filler mixture. Very promising results were obtained when a <b>carrier</b> <b>fabric</b> was used inside the adhesive layer. Secondly, a very common type of joint, the T-joint, has been anti - symmetrically tested. A comparison has been made between a more traditionally produced joint (using a small fillet made from vinyl ester and microballoons based filler and EU-glass tabbing) with a joint produced using a fillet made from the above adhesives. It was found that the results from samples with the fillet using the vinyl ester/filler mixture are the closest to the benchmark samples and it seems to be the best candidate to replace the traditional joint, given the strength, failure mode, price and the availability. The joint using a Sikaflex 252 fillet has shown the most interesting results such that none of the materials forming the joint suffered any visible damage after deformation. The joint using a R 20 mm Plexus MA 550 fillet has benefited from the stiffness and the good adhesion characteristics of the adhesive but in all the tests the panels joined ware damaged earlier than for the benchmark samples...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of medical fabrics is reflected by increased clinical need and consumption {{over the past}} decade in the health and medical sectors. Medical fabric products, including wound dressings, are currently defined as ‘medical devices’ by European legislation. To ensure effectiveness as a wound dressing, these fabrics should assist the repair process by providing sufficient protection against bacterial spread in the wound bed. Chronic wounds are an increasingly urgent health problem, owing to the rising population of elderly, obese and diabetic patients. When treating such wounds with drug releasing dressings, the immediate release of the drug is a common limitation. Thus, the development of smart drug delivery dressings that release antibacterial agents into the wound bed when required would be a useful aid in medicine. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} develop a wound dressing that was able to release the antibacterial agents only in the presence of bacteria. Medical dressings were treated with pH-responsive, self-assembling peptides as antibacterial carriers that were able to release the loaded drug when stimulated by the bacterial pH. A methodology developed for potential future medical application is presented. The preliminary design consisted of three stages. First, the self-assembled peptide candidates were studied and selected as drug <b>carriers.</b> Second, <b>fabrics</b> were treated with the selected self-assembled peptides using two different methods: (1) coating with the peptides from the outer surface by impregnating in peptide solution and (2) incorporating the self-assembled peptides within the structure by electrospinning. The treatment success of the dressing was investigated using a series of complementary techniques such as FTIR, TEM, SEM and CLSM. Third, potential effectiveness of the dressings was assessed in vitro using two antibiotics model, vancomycin and levofloxacin separately, against a Staphylococcus epidermidis bacterial strain, a species commonly found in infected wounds. The study findings clearly demonstrated the in vitro potential of self-assembling peptide technology in improving the function of medical fabrics. ...|$|R
40|$|Proteolytic enzymes are {{a useful}} class of biomolecules {{due to their}} ubiquity and the plethora of {{physiological}} roles they play in living systems. These enzymes are esponsible for the breakdown of proteins to peptides and have several applications in food, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, photographic, waste treatments, bioremediation, and in the textile industry. Cell-envelope proteinases (CEPs) are a special class of industrially relevant extracellular proteolytic enzymes obtained from lactic acid bacteria. In the food industry, CEPs {{have been known to}} improve the texture and organoleptic characteristics of dairy products and also have the potential to release bioactive peptides encrypted in dairy proteins. However, research is lacking on detailed optimisation of fermentation parameters essential for the generation of CEPs of organisms in the genera Lactobacillus. The proteolytic system and CEPs from lactobacilli are also not fully characterized and further; the use of free CEPs in industrial processes is currently suboptimal and presents certain drawbacks such as poor operational stability. Regulatory requirements such as that of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization demand the separation of enzymes from certain food and pharmaceutical products when enzymes are involved in the production process. This is difficult to do, if not impossible, for soluble enzymes. These make soluble CEP-based process economically unfeasible, especially when combined with the usual challenges {{associated with the use of}} most soluble enzymes, i. e. high cost, poor stability, and lack of multiple utility. This study therefore explored the production of CEPs expressed in Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis 313 (LDL 313) in a cost effective manner. Immobilization techniques were also deployed for the design and production of cheap, reusable and stable biocatalysts of LDL 313 CEPs, for use in protein degradation. LDL 313 was an understudied bacterium, thus, initial work considered it’s growth characterization for the purpose of CEP production. As expected, cell growth was dependent on fermentation conditions such as temperature and initial pH. However, cell growth rates under anaerobic conditions were markedly higher than growth under microaerophilic conditions. The caseinolytic specificity of LDL 313 CEPs was also identified. Being proteolytic for for β -casein and κ-casein, CEPs from LDL 313 were classified as class I CEP (CEPI) of the lactococcal proteinase classification system. Studies were also done to optimize the batch culture conditions that enhance CEPs expression. Using a combination of conventional sequential techniques, the batch growth conditions (inoculum concentration, culture agitation speed, incubation temperature, starting pH, and carbon/nitrogen ratio of production medium) were optimized, for the first time, to ensure profuse CEP production in LDL 313. Moreover, since CEPs are cell-envelope-bound enzymes they are relatively easy to extract from lactic acid bacteria cells. When CEP extraction was studied with different extraction agents, 5 M LiCl was observed to be the most suitable. Sub-cellular localization studies also showed that about 95 % of CEP activity was detected in cell-wall fractions implying that CEPs in LDL 313 are located in the peptidoglycan cell-wall. Together, these results provide insights into conditions and parameters that ensure optimum cell growth, high CEP yields and extraction protocol to release high levels of CEPs. Following this, two different strategies for making stable biocatalysts from CEPs were explored, namely, the immobilization of enzymes onto a <b>fabric</b> <b>carrier,</b> and, cross-linking enzyme aggregates. Firstly, CEPs and trypsin (as a model enzyme in comparison with CEP) were immobilized in a simple, cheap and quick approach onto polyester via support functionalization with ethylene diamine and cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. Secondly, cross-linked enzyme aggregates were prepared from CEPs via coupled precipitation/cross-linking with ammonium sulphate and glutaraldehyde respectively. The immobilized biocatalysts had good activity characteristics and properties. For example, immobilized enzymes had good recovered activity (85 % for CEP immobilized on polyester; and ~ 22 % and ~ 41 % respectively for CLCEPA prepared in the absence and presence of proteic feeders). They also had the ability to be used at other than usual conditions such as high temperatures (40 - 70 °C); and organic solvent conditions (CLCEPA still retained activity in 20 – 100 % ethanol/buffer mixtures). Both immobilized enzymes had the ability to be recycled (CLCEPA retained ~ 22 % initial activity whereas CEPs immobilized on polyester retained ~ 41 % when recycled 5 times. Additionally, both immobilized biocatalyst had proteolytic properties, effectively hydrolysing several macromolecular proteins substrates (casein, bovine serum albumin, whey protein isolate, β-lactoglobulin, skimmed-milk protein and chicken egg albumin). The immobilized CEPs biocatalysts could be utilized for protein degradation to obtain two streams of industrially relevant products namely protein/peptide-rich product mixture from casein; and whey protein/peptide-based surface active foams – both of which can be used for food applications. In summary, the potential of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis 313 to produce cell-envelope proteinases was explored and the development of stable forms of these enzymes was studied, optimized and tested with several food proteins. The outcome is a whole systems approach to developing and establishing an enzyme framework for protein degradation in a cheap cost-effective manner. This therefore has the potential for various industrial applications in protein degradation and/or peptide production...|$|R
