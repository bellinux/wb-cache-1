40|$|The present {{invention}} {{provides a}} clamp that is compact and lightweight, yet provides high holding strength and stiffness or rigidity. The clamp uses a unique double slant interface design which provides mechanical advantages to resist forces {{applied to the}} <b>clamp</b> <b>member</b> as the load increases.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{a simple}} single-bolted-joint under tensile separating loads is analysed using conventional analytical methods, a finite element approach and experimental techniques. The variation in bolt force with external load predicted by the finite element analysis conforms well to the experimental results. It is demonstrated that certain detailed features such thread interaction {{do not need to}} be modelled to ensure useful results. Behaviour during the pre-loading phase of use agrees with previous long-standing studies. However, the pre-loading analysis does not carry over to the stage when external loading is applied, as is normally assumed and it is shown that the current, conventional analytical methods substantially over-predict the proportion of the external load carried by the bolt. The basic reason for this is shown to be related to the non-linear variation in contact conditions between the <b>clamped</b> <b>members</b> during the external loading stage...|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} when describing Chi's character, <b>Clamp</b> <b>member</b> Satsuki Igarashi stated [...] "Lately we've {{been saying that}} the easiest to understand is Chii from 'Chobits.' Errors occur with computers. Things like 'Although it's fine to speak the instructions' and 'Please fix this problem here' might be spoken in a cute voice." [...] In addition, an explanation for Chobitss plot was given by Igarashi who stated: [...] "Back then, when our computer had problems all we would get were these inscrutable error messages. However, {{we had no idea}} what was wrong because it wouldn't tell us any more". Clamp also describes Chobits as a variation of the [...] "boy living with mysterious girl" [...] genre. Chi's design as a personal computer resulted from Ohkawa's wish to increase the sense of [...] "emotional discomfort" [...] around becoming emotionally involved with something considered to be merely a lifeless machine.|$|R
50|$|The art {{style of}} the manga draws on the {{influence}} of ukiyo-e wood prints. When making a chapter composed of about twenty pages, Clamp takes around two days to make the artwork, the time differing with the ones from other series they made. The script of the series made by Nanase Ohkawa, who the other <b>Clamp</b> <b>members</b> ask her about any confusion they have before starting drawing the chapters. The illustrations and character designs are mainly done by Tsubaki Nekoi with assistance from Mokona although Satsuki Igarashi also draws various parts. For the series, they decided to use Japanese and Chinese themes, but avoided using tones. Mokona is mainly in charge of designing the female characters, while Nekoi draws the male ones and all the spirits featured. The artwork is also inspired by Alphonse Mucha who Mokona is a fan of. This leads to all the tankobon covers being gold or silver and then color printed over it. The series was retitled xxxHolic Rō ever since volume 16 because of how Watanuki replaced Yuko as the shop's owner.|$|R

She lives with her mad {{scientist}} grandfather, who is very smart, but has a habit of dressing her up in weird cosplay outfits.Rune was born with a sun-like crest on her wrist (known as the Crest of the Sun), and was told by her grandfather that she was the reincarnated Space Queen. Rune refuses to believe almost anything her grandfather says and tries to live a normal life, {{despite the fact that she}} works part-time as a cybernetic superhuman to ward off alien beings that have invaded the earth. Rune's childhood friends, Masaya and Masato Ibayashi, are also cybernetic warriors who bear the Crest of the Sun, but she doesn't know this until later in volume one. It is also revealed that her other close friend, Aina Hazumi, is also a Crest-bearer.A horde of cybernetic aliens hail from Planet X to dominate the earth, and they ensure that their plans are carried out successfully. Many of them are disguised as humans in order to conceal their identities.These alien forces are under the command of Emperor Gald, the mastermind behind the domination of Earth. In the beginning of the series, Gald is [...] "asleep"—he hasn't been awakened to his full power yet. During this time, the aliens are trying to revive him so that he can lead them to their victory.There are five certain objects needed in order to destroy the aliens' operation. These are the six Elements of the Sun. Each piece resembles one part of Sun Crest (five points and a central core). Each one must be obtained before the aliens are able to steal them.In the meantime, another trio of aliens arrive on earth from Planet X.

40|$|Transcendental {{stiffness}} matrices for vibration (or buckling) {{have been}} derived from exact analytical solutions {{of the governing}} differential equations for many structural members without recourse to the discretization of conventional finite element methods (FEM). Their assembly into the overall dynamic structural stiffness matrix gives a transcendental eigenproblem, whose eigenvalues (natural frequencies or critical load factors) can be found with certainty using the Wittrick–Williams algorithm. A very recently discovered analytical property is the member stiffness determinant, which equals the FEM stiffness matrix determinant of a <b>clamped</b> ended <b>member</b> modelled by infinitely many elements, normalized by dividing by its value at zero frequency (or load factor). Curve following convergence methods for transcendental eigenproblems are greatly simplified by multiplying the transcendental overall stiffness matrix determinant by all the member stiffness determinants to remove its poles. In this paper, the transcendental stiffness matrix for a vibrating, axially loaded, Timoshenko member is expressed in a new, convenient notation, enabling the first ever derivation of its member stiffness determinant to be obtained. Further expressions are derived, also for the first time, for unloaded and for static, loaded Timoshenko members. These new expressions have the advantage that they readily reduce to corresponding expressions for Bernoulli–Euler members when shear rigidity and rotatory inertia are neglected. Additionally, the total equivalence of the normalized transcendental determinant with that of an infinite order FEM formulation aids understanding and evaluation of conventional FEM results. Examples are presented to illustrate {{the use of the}} member stiffness determinant...|$|R
40|$|The plastic {{buckling}} {{of columns}} is explored in a regime where plastic wave propagation and lateral buckling are nonlinearly coupled. Underlying {{the work is}} the motivation to understand and quantify the dynamic crushing resistance of truss cores of all-metal sand-wich plates where each truss <b>member</b> is a <b>clamped</b> column. <b>Members</b> are typically fairly stocky such that they buckle plastically and their load carrying capacity decreases gradu-ally as they buckle, even at slow loading rates. In the range of elevated loading rates of interest here, the columns are significantly stabilized by lateral inertia, resisting lateral motion and delaying buckling and loss of load carrying capacity to relatively large over-all plastic strains. The time scale associated with dynamic axial behavior, wherein defor-mation spreads along the column as a plastic wave, {{is comparable to the}} time scale associated with lateral buckling such that the two phenomena are coupled. Several rel-evant problems are analyzed using a combination of analytical and numerical procedures. Material strain-rate dependence is also taken into account. Detailed finite element analy-ses are performed for axially loaded columns with initial imperfections, as well as for inclined columns in a truss core of a sandwich plate, with the aim of determining the resistance of the column to deformation as dependent on the loading rate and the relevant material and geometric parameters. In the range of loading rates of interest, dynamic effects result in substantial increases in the reaction forces exerted by core members on the faces of the sandwich plate with significant elevation in energy absorption.
