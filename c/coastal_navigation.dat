5|$|Shipbuilding {{business}} in Sibu {{started in the}} 1930s to supply wooden boats for river and <b>coastal</b> <b>navigation.</b> It flourished in 1970s and 1980s along with increase in exports of tropical timber from Sarawak. It later shifted its focus into steel boat building. Some of the vessels in demand are tug boats for towing logs, barges for carrying logs, anchor handlers, Offshore Support Vessels (OSV), ferries, and express boats for carrying passengers. Most of the boats built are of small and medium in size. There are a total of 40 shipyards in Sibu. A majority of the workers are welders. In 2003, 17 of the shipyards were relocated to Rantau Panjang Integrated Shipyard Shipbuilding Industrial Zone, Sibu. This included Yong Chin Kui, Far East, and TuongAik. The boats built in Sibu are often exported to neighbouring state of Sabah, Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and United Arab Emirates. In the year 1991, a total of US$50 million was earned for shipbuilding {{business in}} Sibu. In 2011, Sibu ship exports stood at RM 525 million. Sibu is also the only city in Sarawak to possess a vehicle assembly plant. The plant is operated by N.B. Heavy Industries Sdn. Bhd., {{and it has been}} assembling Ankai, BeiBen, Golden Dragon, Huanghai Bus and JAC commercial vehicles since 2010. Sibu has two industrial areas: Upper Lanang Industrial estate (Mixed Light Industries) and Rantau Panjang Ship Building Industrial Zone.|$|E

25|$|When Queensland {{separated}} from New South Wales in 1859 the new colony {{had only one}} lightstation: Cape Moreton Light on Moreton Island, which had a stone lighthouse erected in 1856. (The Raine Island Beacon constructed in 1844 by the British navy {{was no longer in}} use.) This situation was untenable for a colony that relied heavily on coastal shipping. In the 1860s and 1870s the expansion of pastoral and mining activity in northern Queensland led to the establishment of new coastal ports to service the developing hinterlands and the provision of <b>coastal</b> <b>navigation</b> aids became essential.|$|E

His duties included flying as a navigator and observer, including a sortie navigating over a familiar coastline in the Cuxhaven Raid, an inconclusive bombing attack on the Cuxhaven airship base on Christmas Day 1914, for which he was mentioned in despatches. In 1915 he was transferred in a similar role to , in which he served in the Gallipoli Campaign and the eastern Mediterranean, earning himself a Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E

From construction of the first lighthouse in 1896 through to the decommissioning of the second (1968) lighthouse in 1978 the lights on Caloundra Head guided mariners to the northern entrance to the North West Channel – the safest, most reliable and consequently the most used entry channel to the Port of Brisbane.

25|$|<b>Coastal</b> <b>navigation</b> and {{the export}} of locally-produced goods (salt, wine and fabrics) {{dominated}} the local economy around 1600. During the mid-17th century, the siltation of local salterns and a fall in wine exports compelled Nantes to find other activities. Local shipowners began importing sugar from the French West Indies (Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint-Domingue) in the 1640s, which became very profitable after protectionist reforms implemented by Jean-Baptiste Colbert prevented the import of sugar from Spanish colonies (which had dominated the market). In 1664 Nantes was France's eighth-largest port, {{and it was the}} largest by 1700. Plantations in the colonies needed labour to produce sugar, rum, tobacco, indigo dye, coffee and cocoa, and Nantes shipowners began trading African slaves in 1706. The port was part of the triangular trade: ships went to West Africa to buy slaves, slaves were sold in the French West Indies, and the ships returned to Nantes with sugar and other exotic goods. From 1707 to 1793, Nantes was responsible for 42 percent of the French slave trade; its merchants sold about 450,000 African slaves in the West Indies.|$|E

Seven of the nine seaplanes successfully took off for the attack, but they inflicted little damage. Only three of the aircraft returned to be recovered, but the crews of the other three ditched safely and were recovered by a British submarine and the Dutch trawler Marta van Hattem. A notable member of her crew was Robert Erskine Childers who served an instructor in <b>coastal</b> <b>navigation</b> to newly trained pilots.

40|$|Abstract—Sea clutter {{refers to}} the radar {{backscatter}} from the ocean surface. Accurate modeling of sea clutter and rough sea surface is an important problem in radar signal processing and applications, as it facilitates robust detection of low observable targets within sea clutter, which has significant importance to <b>coastal</b> security, <b>navigation</b> safety and environmental monitoring. Great efforts {{have been made to}} model sea clutter. However, the nature of sea clutter is poorly understood and the important problem of target detection within sea clutter remains a tremendous challenge.
