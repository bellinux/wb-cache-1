5000|$|The {{pioneering}} {{research work}} of the Harvard Psychological Clinic in the 1930s, summarized in Explorations in Personality, provided the start point for future studies of personality, especially those relating to needs and motives. David C. McClelland's and his associates' investigations of achievement motivation have particular relevance {{to the emergence of}} leadership. McClelland was interested in the possibility of deliberately arousing a motive to achieve in an attempt to explain how individuals express their preferences for particular outcomes—a general problem of motivation. In this connection, the need for achievement refers to an individual's preference for success under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition.</b> The vehicle McClelland employed to establish the presence of an achievement motive was the type of fantasy a person expressed on the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), developed by Christiana Morgan and Henry Murray, who note in Explorations in Personality that [...] "...when a person interprets an ambiguous social situation he is apt to expose his own personality as much as the phenomenon to which he is attending... Each picture should suggest some critical situation and be effective in evoking a fantasy relating to it" [...] (p531). The test is composed of a series of pictures that subjects are asked to interpret and describe to the psychologist. The TAT has been widely used to support assessment of needs and motives.|$|E

40|$|Visual {{extinction}} is {{an intriguing}} defect of awareness in stroke patients, {{referring to the}} unsuccessful perception of contra-lesional events under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition.</b> Previous studies have investigated the cortical and subcortical brain structures that, when damaged or inactivated, provoke visual extinction. The present experiment asked how lesions of subcortical struc-tures {{may contribute to the}} appearance of visual extinction. We investigated whether lesions centering on right basal ganglia may induce dysfunction in distant, structurally intact cortical structures. Normalized perfusion-weighted MRI was used to iden-tify structurally intact but abnormally perfused brain tissue, that is, zones that are receiving enough blood supply to remain struc-turally intact but not enough to function normally. We compared patients with right basal ganglia lesions showing versus not show-ing visual extinction. In the extinction patients, the contrast re-vealed cortical malperfusion that clustered around the right TPJ. It seems as if malfunction of this area is a critical aspect in visual extinction not only after cortical lesion but also in the case of subcortical basal ganglia damage. Our results support the idea that a normally functioning TPJ area plays a decisive role for the attentional network involved in detecting of visual stimuli under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition.</b> ...|$|E
