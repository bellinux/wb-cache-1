5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine <b>cowlings.</b> Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E

25|$|Boeing {{considered}} {{safety features}} highly, building in structural strength {{as well as}} incorporating design elements that enhanced customer comfort and well-being, such as the thermostatically-controlled, air conditioned and soundproof cabin. The crew included a pilot and copilot {{as well as a}} flight attendant who could tend to passenger needs. The main landing gear did not fully retract; a portion of the wheels extended below the nacelles, typical of designs of the time, as a means of reducing structural damage in a wheels-up landing. The tailwheel was not retractable. While the Model 247 and 247A had speed-ring engine <b>cowlings</b> and fixed-pitch propellers, the Model 247D incorporated NACA <b>cowlings</b> and variable-pitch propellers.|$|E
25|$|Visibility: Pilot {{visibility}} may be poorer due to {{the width}} of the engine on single-engine aircraft, although tight fitting <b>cowlings</b> helped reduce this factor somewhat.

40|$|Summative Assessment of the Core Module „Theoretical Developments in the Science and Art of Nursing“. The {{purpose of}} this article is to place <b>Cowling’s</b> unitary appreciative inquiry method in the context of nursing science and the {{development}} of unique nursing research methods. Unitary appreciative inquiry is one of a few nursing research and practice methodologies based on Martha Rogers’ theory, the Science of Unitary Human Beings. This article is reflecting the development of the unitary appreciative inquiry method in analyzing articles and literature published by Cowling and other authors that are related to <b>Cowling’s</b> ideas and approaches. A brief overview of the basic concepts, assumptions and principles of Rogers’ theory is given as well as some insights on other major influences on <b>Cowling’s</b> work. The changes that have been made over the past seventeen years from pattern appraisal to pattern appreciation and unitary appreciative inquiry in its current use are mapped and its contribution to current nursing knowledge and practice is critically reviewed. The author of this article strongly beliefs that nursing needs to develop its own research methods based on nursing theories for further development and improvement of nursing science as an independent and accepted discipline in human health care. It is from that perspective that <b>Cowling’s</b> work is reviewed...|$|R

25|$|The Model C90-1 entered {{production}} in 1982 after 507 C90s and 347 E90s had been built, and featured PT6A-21 engines and {{improvements to the}} pressurization system. 54 were built. The following year the F90-1 was put into production with redesigned engine <b>cowlings,</b> upgraded PT6A-135A engines, hydraulic landing gear, and triple-fed electrical bus; only 33 were built by the time production terminated in 1985. The C90-1 was soon followed by the Model C90A, which featured the redesigned engine <b>cowlings</b> of the F90-1. The C90A received an increase in MTOW in 1987, being certified to 10,100lb (4,580kg). The C90A model was in production until 1992, by which time 235 had been built, all but 74 with the increased MTOW.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{claims about}} the {{convergence}} in methodology between ‘high politics’ and the ‘new political history’ remain unclear. The {{first part of this}} review examines two deeply entrenched misunderstandings of key works of high politics from the 1960 s and 1970 s, namely that they proposed elitist arguments about the ‘closed’ nature of the political world, and reductive arguments about the irrelevance of ‘ideas’ to political behaviour. The second part traces the intellectual ancestry of Maurice <b>Cowling's</b> thinking about politics, and places it within an interpretative tradition of social science. The formative influences of R. G. Collingwood and Michael Oakeshott are examined, and Mark Bevir's Logic of the history of ideas is used to highlight how <b>Cowling's</b> approach can be aligned with ‘new political history’...|$|R

25|$|As {{completed}} the Dyott Bomber was a four-bay tractor biplane with equal-span wings. It was powered by two Beardmore 120 hp water-cooled six-cylinder engines which were mounted, without <b>cowlings,</b> between the wings. The aircraft had a fixed nosewheel undercarriage, with the nosewheel balanced {{by a large}} tailskid. It carried a crew of three, with a pilot and two gunners, in nose and dorsal positions.|$|E
25|$|The most {{recognizable}} external change {{was the use}} of the three-panel Erla-Haube clear-view canopy, which filled the entire canopy length behind the four-panel windscreen unit, which eliminated the older, rear fixed canopy section. Internal changes included inheriting the new 2,000W generator and the DB 605 D-2 engine of the 109K. Apart from the standardised streamlined engine <b>cowlings,</b> G-10s with the DB605 D-2 were equipped as standard with the MW-50 booster system (DB 605DM, later 605DB) and had a larger Fo 987 oil cooler housed in a deeper fairing. Also, because of the engine's enlarged crankcase and the oil return lines which ran in front of it, these G-10s had small blister fairings incorporated into the lower engine <b>cowlings,</b> forward of and below the exhaust stacks. The radio antenna mast was also removed from atop the rear fuselage turtledeck, and replaced with {{what appears to be the}} swept-back antenna from the Me 163B Komet rocket fighter, but oriented in reverse from the rocket fighter's mount, in being swept forward instead from its port wing leading edge underside mount on the G-10 subtype.|$|E

Its all-metal monoplane airframe, along with its features of closed cockpits, rotating gun turrets (almost simultaneously to the British Overstrand biplane bomber's own enclosed nose-turret), retractable landing gear, internal bomb bay, and full engine <b>cowlings,</b> would become the standard for bomber designs worldwide for decades. It made all existing bombers completely obsolete. In 1932, Martin received the Collier Trophy for designing the XB-10.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} {{study of the}} magnetic field generated by an axisymmetrically forced flow in a spherical domain. At small enough Reynolds number, Re, the flow is axisymmetric and generates an equatorial dipole above a critical magnetic Reynolds number Rmc. The magnetic field thus breaks axisymmetry, in agreement with <b>Cowling's</b> theorem. This structure of the magnetic field is however replaced by a dominant axial dipole when Re is larger and allows non axisymmetric fluctuations in the flow. We show here {{that even in the}} absence of such fluctuations, an axial dipole can also be generated, at low Re, through a secondary bifurcation, when Rm is increased above the dynamo threshold. The system therefore always find a way to bypass the constraint imposed by <b>Cowling's</b> theorem. We understand the dynamical behaviors that result from the interaction of equatorial and axial dipolar modes using simple model equations for their amplitudes derived from symmetry arguments.

25|$|Based on a {{prototype}} with the factory designation 4A15, the G.I and its successors were built to a conventional bomber design for their time, two-bay biplanes with unstaggered wings of unequal span. The pilot sat {{in an open}} cockpit just forward of the wings, and open positions were provided in the nose and amidships for a gunner and observer. The engines were mounted pusher-fashion in nacelles atop the lower wings and enclosed in streamlined <b>cowlings.</b> Fixed tricycle undercarriage was fitted, with dual wheels on each unit.|$|E
25|$|The Yak-16 was a low-winged, twin-engined {{monoplane}} {{that closely}} resembled the Li-2. The metal-skinned, semi-monocoque fuselage had {{room for a}} two-person cockpit and ten passengers plus a toilet and baggage hold. The control surfaces of the tail were fabric-covered although the tail itself was metal-skinned. The two-spar metal wing was built in three sections, a rectangular center section and two trapezoidal outer panels. The main undercarriage legs retracted forward into the engine nacelles, with the wheels remaining semi-exposed, while the tailwheel was fixed. The ASh-21 engines had NACA <b>cowlings</b> and drove two-bladed variable-pitch VISh-11V-20 propellers.|$|E
