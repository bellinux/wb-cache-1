25|$|The old Key System Piedmont shops {{building}} at Bay Place and Harrison {{is now a}} Whole Foods Market retail store. This building was originally built in 1890 as the powerhouse and <b>car</b> <b>barn</b> of the Piedmont Cable Car Co. In the 1920s, it was substantially remodeled and used as a Cadillac showroom which closed in the mid-1990s. The building sat vacant until 2003, when Whole Foods initiated a radical interior redesign while retaining and restoring much of the facade.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, the Ferries and Cliff House Railway {{opened its}} initial two-line system. The Powell-Mason line is still {{operated}} {{on the same}} route today; their other route was the Powell-Washington-Jackson line, stretches of which are used by today's Powell-Hyde line. The Ferries & Cliff House Railway was also responsible for {{the building of a}} <b>car</b> <b>barn</b> and powerhouse at Washington and Mason, and this site is still in use today. In the same year, it also purchased the original Clay Street Hill Railway, which it incorporated into a new Sacramento-Clay line in 1892.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{building on}} the site was a trolley <b>car</b> <b>barn</b> for the Broadway Railroad's Broadway streetcar line, opened in 1859. The barn began serving buses in 1931, and was acquired by the city during unification in 1940. Construction on the current bus depot began in 1947. The depot was built {{on top of the}} subway tunnel roof of the IND Fulton Street Line, which had been built in the early 1940s. The depot opened on December 17, 1950. The trolley barn was replaced by the current depot on October 30, 1956, when Brooklyn streetcar service ended.|$|E

25|$|Mayor Dianne Feinstein {{took charge}} of the effort, and helped win federal funding for the bulk of the {{rebuilding}} job. In 1982 the cable car system was closed again for a complete rebuild. This involved the complete replacement of 69 city blocks' worth of tracks and cable channels, the complete rebuilding of the <b>car</b> <b>barn</b> and powerhouse within the original outer brick walls, new propulsion equipment, and the repair or rebuild of 37 cable cars. The system reopened on June 21, 1984, in time to benefit from the publicity that accompanied San Francisco's hosting of that year's Democratic National Convention.|$|E
25|$|The site of {{the depot}} was {{initially}} home to the Lenox Avenue Car House, a two-story <b>car</b> <b>barn</b> and power station, built by the Metropolitan Street Railway for their Lenox Avenue Line, the first line {{in the city to}} use conduit electrification. The line and depot began service on July 9, 1895. The New York City Omnibus Corporation, which had replaced the trolley lines with bus routes in 1936, began constructing a new bus garage on the site in 1938. Operations from the new depot began on July 31, 1939. It was rehabilitated in 1990. This depot had capacity for 123 buses. On September 23, 1993 it was renamed the Mother Clara Hale Depot.|$|E
25|$|The Tuskegee Airmen Depot, {{formerly}} named 100th Street Depot, {{is located}} at 1552 Lexington Avenue, filling the block bounded by Park Avenue, Lexington Avenue, and 99th and 100th Streets in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, north of the 96th Street subway station, and near the 97th St portal of the Park Avenue Tunnel. The depot had been a <b>car</b> <b>barn</b> for streetcars on the Lexington Avenue Line, built in 1895. The depot was closed in spring 1998 and was reconstructed, while the Michael J. Quill Depot was opened to replace it. The depot reopened on September 7, 2003, taking {{on a number of}} routes from the Hudson Depot. It became the Tuskegee Airmen Depot on March 23, 2012, in honor of the famous World War II airmen.

25|$|Several {{streetcar}} {{lines and}} interurban railways interchanged passengers in Georgetown. The station {{was located in}} front of the stone wall on Canal Road (currently occupied by a gas station) adjacent to the Exorcist steps, and the former D.C. Transit <b>car</b> <b>barn</b> {{at the end of the}} Key Bridge. Four suburban Virginia lines, connecting through Rosslyn, Virginia, provided links from the D.C. streetcar network to Mount Vernon, Falls Church, Great Falls, Fairfax, Vienna, Leesburg, and Purcellville. Streetcar operations in Washington, D.C. ended January 28, 1962. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad built an 11-mile branch line from Silver Spring, Maryland, to Water Street in Georgetown in an abortive attempt to construct a southern connection to Alexandria, Virginia. The line served as an industrial line, shipping coal to a General Services Administration power plant on K Street (now razed) until 1985. The abandoned right-of-way has since been converted into the Capital Crescent Trail – a rails-to-trails route – and the power plant replaced by a condo.|$|E
25|$|Charles Street {{continues}} through Midtown, which contains the Belvedere Hotel and several historic rowhouses on adjacent Chase Street. The street passes {{along the east}} side of the University of Baltimore and University of Baltimore School of Law before meeting I-83 (Jones Falls Expressway) at the northern end of the neighborhood. The partial interchange with I-83 features ramps from southbound I-83 to Maryland Avenue one block to the west and to Charles Street itself, and an entrance ramp from Charles Street to northbound I-83. Immediately to the east of the I-83 overpass is Pennsylvania Station, the main train station of Baltimore that has intercity service on Amtrak, commuter service on MARC's Penn Line, and light rail service on the Penn Station spur of the Baltimore Light Rail. Charles Street crosses over several tracks of the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and enters the Charles North neighborhood. Between Lanvale and Lafayette streets, which form the east and west components of MD 25 (which becomes Falls Road), the street passes the Charles Theatre and the Baltimore City Passenger Railway Power House and <b>Car</b> <b>Barn.</b> Charles Street continues one more block as an unnumbered highway before reaching the southern terminus of MD 139 at North Avenue, which carries US 1 and US 40 Truck.|$|E
25|$|The West Farms Depot {{was located}} at 1857 Boston Road, {{just north of}} the 174th Street subway station in the Crotona Park East section of the Bronx. The site {{consisted}} of two maintenance buildings, one on a triangular plot bound by East 175th Street, Southern Boulevard, and Boston Road, and the second {{on the north side of}} 175th Street and the Cross Bronx Expressway on the east. Built in 1894 by the Union Railway as a <b>car</b> <b>barn,</b> it was used to store and maintain buses until April 3, 1983, when it was closed and replaced by the Walnut Depot, and later the Gun Hill Depot. Before it closed in early 1983, it serviced the following Bronx Local Routes; Bx3 Prospect/Crotona Av's (now Bx17), Bx11 170 Street/Claremont Pkwy. Crosstown, Bx25 Morris/Jerome Av's (now Bx32), Bx26 Boston Road/Morris Park Av (now Bx21), Bx28 Williamsbridge (now Bx39), Bx29 125 Street X-Town & Willis/Third Av's (now Bx15 & Bx15 LTD), Bx31 145/149 Street X-Town & Southern Blvd (now Bx19), Bx32 Saint Ann's Avenue (discontinued in 1984), Bx34 155/163 Street Crosstown & Hunts Point Av (now Bx6), Bx35 167/169 Street's Crosstown, Bx41 Webster Av-White Plains Road, Bx42 Westchester Avenue (now Bx4/Bx4A), and Bx49 Highbridge (discontinued and combined with Bx13). The buildings continued to stand as recently as 2002, decaying and becoming havens for crime. The depot has since been demolished, replaced by housing developments and a self storage facility. The nearby Coliseum Depot was renamed the West Farms Depot when it reopened in 2003.|$|E

5000|$|The West Ankeny <b>Car</b> <b>Barns</b> Bay E is {{a former}} {{streetcar}} carbarn in Portland, Oregon, that is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Completed in 1911, {{it was one of}} three buildings that collectively made up the Ankeny <b>Car</b> <b>Barns</b> complex [...] of the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company (PRL&P), the owner and operator of Portland's streetcar system at the time. By 1978, the brick building had become the only surviving structure from the Ankeny complex and one of only two surviving remnants of carbarn complexes of the Portland area's large street railway and interurban system of the past, the other being the PRL&P's Sellwood Division Carbarn Office and Clubhouse.|$|R
500|$|Located {{behind the}} company {{headquarters}} building was the railway's <b>car</b> <b>barn,</b> the location where the streetcars were stored and maintained. [...] Though constructed of only leftover rail and corrugated iron, the <b>car</b> <b>barn</b> suited the railway's purpose, and most repair {{work was done}} in shop. [...] The <b>car</b> <b>barn</b> has since become {{the entrance to a}} Greyhound Lines bus station.|$|E
500|$|As of 1920, the C's {{line was}} {{approximately}} [...] long. [...] The line began at its easternmost {{point at the}} C Station and continued west down West Main Street. [...] At the intersection of West Main Street and Ridge Street, a short branch line down Ridge Street was in service to reach the company's <b>car</b> <b>barn.</b> [...] The main street line continued past Ridge Street, the Charlottesville Union Station, and passed over the Southern Railway tracks {{before coming to the}} junction of West Main Street and Jefferson Park Avenue approximately [...] west of the Southern tracks. [...] At this point the line split, with one line following Jefferson Park Avenue south for approximately [...] to Jefferson Park and Fry's Spring. [...] The other line, approximately [...] long, continued west on West Main Street to the University of Virginia, passing the Rotunda, before turning north on Rugby Road where the line ended just before reaching the C mainline.|$|E
500|$|As older {{forms of}} {{transportation}} {{such as the}} canal boat disappeared, new forms arose. One of these, the electric trolley, began operation in Lock Haven in 1894. The Lock Haven Electric Railway, managed by the Lock Haven Traction Company and after 1900 by the Susquehanna Traction Company, ran passenger trolleys between Lock Haven and Mill Hall, about [...] to the west. The trolley line extended from the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad station in Lock Haven to a station of the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania, which served Mill Hall. The route went through Lock Haven's downtown, close to the Normal School, across town to the trolley <b>car</b> <b>barn</b> on the southwest edge of the city, through Flemington, over the Bald Eagle Canal and Bald Eagle Creek, and on to Mill Hall via what was then known as the Lock Haven, Bellefonte, and Nittany Valley Turnpike. Plans to extend the line from Mill Hall to Salona, [...] south of Mill Hall, and to Avis [...] northeast of Lock Haven, were never carried out, and the line remained unconnected to other trolley lines. The system, always financially marginal, declined after World War I. Losing business to automobiles and buses, it ceased operations around 1930.|$|E
50|$|In 1928 at 18 {{years of}} age, Moore {{took a job}} as a {{pinsetter}} at <b>Car</b> <b>Barns,</b> a local bowling alley, earning six cents a line. True to form, Moore was a quick study, for a time carrying a 233 bowling average. Moore first picked up a cue stick at <b>Car</b> <b>Barns,</b> playing on the single 4 x 8 foot pool table the bowling alley had available. According to Moore he immediately fell in love with the game; specifically, with the game of straight pool (14.1 continuous), at which he would chiefly compete during his career, though not to the exclusion of all other billiard disciplines—Moore would become national snooker champion, and would place second at the 1961 First Annual World's One-Pocket Billiards Tournament in Johnston City, Illinois.|$|R
