5|$|In {{addition}} to the expected increase in cargo traffic, the Port of Miami recently stated that October 2010 was its busiest October ever for <b>cruise</b> vacations. The port had a record 346,513 <b>cruise</b> passengers that October, up 29% from October 2009. This follows a record year in <b>cruise</b> traffic, with 4.15 million <b>cruise</b> passengers in the 12 months that ended in September. This is partially due {{to the arrival of}} new <b>cruise</b> ships such as the Norwegian Epic, as well as the <b>cruise</b> line Costa Cruises. Despite this, the Port of Miami has recently been losing <b>cruise</b> and cargo traffic to nearby Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale. In 2010, Royal Caribbean <b>Cruise</b> Lines, which is headquartered in Miami, chose Port Everglades as home for its new <b>cruise</b> ships, Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas, currently the largest <b>cruise</b> ships in the world.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 the 36-year-old QE2 was {{replaced}} on the North Atlantic by Queen Mary 2. Caronia was sold and QE2 continued to <b>cruise</b> {{until she was}} retired in 2008. In 2007 Cunard added a large <b>cruise</b> ship, Queen Victoria. She is not a sister for the QM2, being ordered by Carnival as a Vista class <b>cruise</b> ship for the Holland America Line. To reinforce Cunard traditions, the QV has a small museum on board. Cunard commissioned a second Vista class <b>cruise</b> ship, Queen Elizabeth, in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Pommern was {{assigned}} to the II Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet alongside her sisters. She took part in the annual training cruises and maneuvers {{with the rest of the}} High Seas Fleet between 1908 and 1914. This included fleet training in the Baltic in 1908 and a <b>cruise</b> into the Atlantic the following year. In May 1910 Pommern took part in fleet training in the Kattegat between Denmark and Norway, followed by a <b>cruise</b> to Norway in the summer. At the end of 1910, the fleet conducted another <b>cruise</b> into the Baltic. The next two years followed a similar pattern, though the summer <b>cruise</b> in 1912 was interrupted by the Agadir Crisis. As a result, the <b>cruise</b> was only into the Baltic. Later in the year Pommern took part in maneuvers off the island of Helgoland in the North Sea.|$|E

5|$|Posen {{participated in}} several {{training}} exercises {{with the rest}} of the fleet before the outbreak of war. In late 1910 the fleet conducted a training <b>cruise</b> into the Baltic Sea. The following year the fleet conducted maneuvers in May; the annual summer <b>cruise</b> to Norway followed in July. The fleet participated in another round of fleet exercises in the Baltic in September, followed by another set at the end of the year. The next year followed a similar pattern, though the summer <b>cruise</b> to Norway was interrupted by the Agadir crisis; as a result, the summer <b>cruise</b> only went into the Baltic. The September exercises were conducted off Helgoland in the North Sea; another winter <b>cruise</b> into the Baltic followed at the end of the year. The training schedule returned to normal for 1913 and 1914, and the summer cruises again went to Norway. For the 1914 <b>cruise,</b> the fleet departed for Norwegian waters on 14 July, some two weeks after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. The probability of war cut the <b>cruise</b> short; Posen and the rest of the fleet were back in Wilhelmshaven by 29 July.|$|E

In November 2011 the company made Galveston home port to its 3,960-passenger mega-ships Carnival Magic and Carnival Triumph, as well. Carnival Magic sails a seven-day Caribbean <b>cruise</b> from Galveston, and it is the largest <b>cruise</b> ship based at the Port year-round. Galveston is the home port to Royal Caribbean International's, MS Liberty of the Seas, which is the largest <b>cruise</b> ship ever based here and one of the largest ships in the world.

5|$|After commissioning, Schlesien was {{assigned}} to the I Battle Squadron. Her first year of service, 1909, saw a pattern of fleet maneuvers in the North and Baltic Seas as well as the Atlantic Ocean. Her first <b>cruise</b> into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August. Another round of exercises followed in the autumn. The I Battle Squadron was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven in April 1910. The following month, in May 1910, the fleet conducted training maneuvers in the Kattegat, between Norway and Denmark. For the first time, the annual summer <b>cruise</b> went to Norway. Fleet training followed, and a training <b>cruise</b> into the Baltic took place {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E

Hiei played a minor role in the Russo-Japanese War before she was reclassified as a survey ship in 1906. Hiei was stricken from the Navy List on 1 April 1911 and ordered to be sold on 21 December.

5|$|Following her commissioning, Kaiser Barbarossa was {{assigned}} to the I Squadron of the Heimatflotte (Home Fleet), which shortly thereafter went on a <b>cruise</b> to Spain. While moored in Cádiz, the ships met the four Brandenburg-class ships, which were returning from their expedition to suppress the Boxer Rebellion in China. From 22 August to 21 September, Kaiser Barbarossa participated in the annual autumn maneuvers of the entire fleet. While in the Danzig Bay, the fleet conducted a naval review for the visiting Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, whose wife Alexandra was Wilhelm's cousin. The winter <b>cruise</b> in December went to southern Norway. In April and May 1902, the squadron went on a training <b>cruise</b> to Britain, followed by a tour of the Kiel Week sailing regatta in late June. The ships then took part in another training <b>cruise</b> to Norway in July and then the autumn maneuvers, which began in the Baltic and concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the Jade. During the exercise, which lasted from 17 August to 18 September, Kaiser Barbarossa and the rest of I Squadron were assigned to play the roles of both the German fleet and hostile forces.

5|$|For {{the next}} several years, Elsass {{and the rest of}} the fleet were {{occupied}} with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May, a major fleet <b>cruise</b> during the summer, followed by annual fall maneuvers with the whole fleet in August and September. The year would typically conclude with a winter training <b>cruise.</b> For Elsass, her career began with squadron training in the North Sea and Baltic Sea in May, followed by the summer <b>cruise</b> in July and August. In August, before the annual fleet maneuvers, the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet in Swinemünde. The year 1906 followed the same pattern, concluding with fleet exercises in the North Sea in December before returning to Kiel. Further maneuvers in the North Sea occupied the fleet for much of the first half of 1907, followed by a summer <b>cruise</b> to Norway and the annual autumn maneuvers in August and September.
