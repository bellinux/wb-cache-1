The home owner often shuts off the disconnect to the outdoor condensing unit for the winter, leaving the compressor without crankcase heat.

40|$|Transient {{stress wave}} propagations in a valve due to impact and stress wave {{reflections}} from its free boundaries {{account for the}} fatigue failure near the <b>compressor</b> <b>valve</b> tip. The goals of this research project are to identify {{the characteristics of the}} stress wave propagation and reflections in a valve plate in order to obtain some fundamental understanding of valve failures due to impact. ^ The analytical solution to this problem is based on the method of transformations and the Cagniard method. A Green 2 ̆ 7 s function is formulated for a vertical point load on the elastic half-space (Lamb 2 ̆ 7 s problem) since the mathematical model of the half-space is easier to handle than that of the infinite plate. A numerical solution is obtained by evaluating the complex integral equations of the Green 2 ̆ 7 s function. A simple and efficient convolution scheme is developed for numerically extending this point {{solution to the problem of}} impact pressure distribution. A superposition algorithm is developed for the purpose of obtaining the displacements and stresses of the plate interior by utilizing the half-space solutions. The superposition method consists of two steps to satisfy the free boundary conditions of the plate, which is a unique feature of the algorithm. Several numerical results are presented for the half-space and infinite plate. ^ The three dimensional stress wave solution is compared with the one dimensional solution for certain limiting cases. The agreement of the two solutions is quite excellent. ^ The stress reversal phenomenon at the free boundary of the plate and the stress fluctuation near the S wave front indicate that the plate may fail earlier than expected by using conventional S-N curves. Thus, it is suggested that new S-N curves which incorporate the impact loading be constructed for a better <b>compressor</b> <b>valve</b> life prediction. ...|$|E

An adequate evaluation of vibroactivity of piston machines is provided by the Russian regulative database on vibration parameters.

40|$|Faults {{diagnosis}} in {{air conditioning}} systems is a crucial activity, since malfunctions may induce heavy degradation of performance. Among the available techniques, thermoeconomic diagnosis has played a marginal role due to the difficulties encountered when applying the methodology to refrigeration plants. In this paper a critical analysis on capabilities and limits of thermoeconomic diagnosis is proposed. The reference plant is a 120 kWc air-cooled air conditioning system; a simulator is used to evaluate thermodynamic data under normal and faulty conditions, setting up “virtual experiments” to simulate each fault. Five malfunctions are imposed, either individually or simultaneously: fouling at condenser and evaporator, refrigerant undercharge, <b>compressor</b> <b>valve</b> leakage and extra-superheating along suction line. From a qualitative viewpoint, the examined approach resulted efficient in identifying some faults, although false fault signals eventually emerged.

40|$|Thermoeconomic faults {{diagnosis}} of {{air conditioning units}} is a pioneeristic approach to detect single or multiple faults and quantify their impact in terms of additional energy consumption. The poor reliability of conventional thermoeconomic approaches has been limiting the interest for practical applications of this technique. In this paper an improved thermoeconomic diagnosis is proposed and applied to a reference 120 kWc air-cooled air conditioning system; a simulator is used to evaluate thermodynamic data under normal and faulty conditions. Four faults are individually or simultaneously imposed: fouling at condenser and evaporator, refrigerant undercharge and <b>compressor</b> <b>valve</b> leakage. For setting up the diagnostic tool only a few numerical or experimental tests are required; the results testify the procedure to be sufficiently reliable both when heavy or light faults are considered. Also, {{the performance of the}} diagnostic procedure slightly improves when the effects of “system level” faults like refrigerant undercharge are preliminarily filtered...|$|E
40|$|Effective signal {{processing}} in fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) {{is an important}} measure to prevent failure and accidents of machinery. To address the end distortion and frequency aliasing issues in conventional lifting wavelet transform, a Volterra series assisted undecimated lifting wavelet packet transform (ULWPT) is investigated for machinery incipient fault diagnosis. Undecimated lifting wavelet packet transform is firstly formulated to eliminate the frequency aliasing issue in traditional lifting wavelet packet transform. Next, Volterra series, as a boundary treatment method, is used to preprocess the signal to suppress the end distortion in undecimated lifting wavelet packet transform. Finally, the decomposed wavelet coefficients are trimmed to the original length as the signal of interest for machinery incipient fault detection. Experimental study on a reciprocating compressor is performed to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} presented method.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has been presented that suggests using instantaneous system power measurements {{can be used to}} perform fault detection for rooftop units.

Â This work presents data collected from several rooftop units subjected to different faults and ambient conditions using psychrometric chamber test facilities. Â The results of the testing show that total system power is not very sensitive to many common faults affecting direct-expansion air-conditioning equipment. Â In fact, only condenser fouling faults increase instantaneous power at significant levels. Â Other faults, such as improper refrigerant charge level, liquid-line restriction, or <b>compressor</b> <b>valve</b> leakage, may lead to total power reduction and also, in general, have relatively weak impacts on total system power. Â Virtual sensor measurements of total cooling capacity or coefficient of performance (COP) are more sensitive fault detection indicators than system power...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the testing of a statistical, rule-based fault detection and diagnostic method on a rooftop air conditioning unit. When faults occur in the unit, the measured thermodynamic states differ from the states which are predicted by a model for normal system behavior, generating residuals. The magnitude and statistical uncertainty of the residuals determine the detection sensitivity of the technique. The directional changes in the residuals are statistically compared with a set of rules in order to diagnose a fault. By experimentally introducing faults to the air conditioning unit at five different operating conditions and recording the changes in output states, the detection sensitivity of the technique was quantified and the robustness of the diagnostic rules was verified. Results show that the technique is able to reliably detect refrigerant leakage, condenser fouling, evaporator fouling, liquid line restriction, and <b>compressor</b> <b>valve</b> leakage over a wide range of operating conditions, before a significant decrease in the capacity and COP has occurred. However, the sensitivity of the technique is influenced by the operating conditions of the unit. 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of a reciprocating compressor is {{closely linked to the}} performance of its valves, in terms of both life and efficiency. To better understand the factors that affect reciprocating <b>compressor</b> <b>valve</b> performance and life, a Gas Machinery Research Council (GMRC) program has been initiated to systematically investigate the physical behavior of valve plates during compressor operation. A reciprocating compressor’s valve plate life is generally considered to be a function of the plate’s cyclic kinematics, transient stresses, and material properties. Thus, the valve research program aims to incorporate these fundamental factors into an analysis model that accurately predicts valve life for a given application, geometry, and plate material. The research will benefit users within the gas industry by providing a basis for improvements in applications engineering and operational decision-making related to reciprocating compressor valves. The analysis model developed by the research program is based on results from plate single impact tests, finite element (FE) calculations, optical valve plate 3 -D motion measurements, and material high cycle fatigue testing.
