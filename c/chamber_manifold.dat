This phenomenon manifests as time-dependent decrease of current and resistance and precludes the ability to carry out prolonged experiments aimed at examining the regulation of this transport. We developed methods for prolonged stable recordings of epithelial Na+ transport using modifications of the short-circuit current technique and commercial Ussing-type chambers. We utilize the polarized MDCK cell line expressing the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) to describe these methods. Briefly, existing commercial chambers were modified to allow continuous flow of Ringer solution and precise control of such flow. <b>Chamber</b> <b>manifolds</b> and associated plumbing were modified to allow precise temperature clamp preventing temperature oscillations. Recording electrodes were modified to eliminate the use of KCl and prevent membrane depolarization from KCl leakage. Solutions utilized standard bicarbonate-based buffers, but all gasses were prehydrated to clamp buffer osmolarity. We demonstrate that these modifications result in measurements of current and resistance that are stable for at least 2 h. We further demonstrate that drifts in osmolarity similar to those obtained before prior to our modifications can lead to a decrease of current and resistance similar to those attributed to rundown...|$|R

This paper presents experimental data from a heat-pipe Evacuated Tube Solar Water Heater (ETSWH) subjected to the Northern Maritime Climate at the University of Ulster’s outdoor solar testing facility located at the Jordanstown campus. The thermal performance of this across solar noon (± 30 min) was experimentally determined to be comparable to two physical laboratory 10 pin-fin model manifolds constructed to the same dimensions and geometry as the <b>manifold</b> <b>chamber</b> of the heat-pipe ETSWH when operated under steady laboratory conditions.

It was found that at the pin-fin diameter to pitch used in the model manifold that normalised surface temperatures decrease at certain points in the array due to the action of buoyant flow generated from upstream pin-fins which increased heat transfer.

When required preserve food for a time, a dry or dehydrate alternative is removing the water contained therein. There are several ways to achieve this issue, the simplest is to exposed the food into a stream of air with certain conditions of temperature, humidity and velocity. There are several types of solar dryers to achieve proper product treatment. The two basic elements of a solar dryer are manifold where solar radiation heats the air and the drying chamber where the product is dried by the air passing through it, these elements can be designed to integrate the team in different forms. In an indirect solar dryer the two elements are separated, the air is heated in the manifold so that no solar radiation incident on the product placed inside the opaque drying chamber, in this type of dryers the process control drying is simpler. Having a separate drying <b>chamber</b> <b>manifolds</b> facilitates handling of the product and the work of loading and unloading. Since the drying chamber is opaque, this system conveniently dry products that can be damaged by direct sunlight. This project works with an indirect solar dryer having a solar air heater built into its structure with plywood wood 1 ” thick, both the base and sides, with dimensions of 140 cm long and 60 cm width, a cover glass thickness of 3 mm and an inclination of 17. 5 ° to the horizontal. The main element is a coil of copper foil matt black painted placed inside the structure, isolated base and on all four sides with fiberglass wool, has thirteen channels 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, which means a final length of 5 m in the warm air path, giving a conservative 0. 01 m 3 /s flow and a 1 m/s natural convection speed. The drying chamber is constructed of plywood wood ½” thickness and dimensions of 60 cm long, 40 cm wide and 55 cm high with four nylon mesh trays, allowing initial drying mass about 2 kg. The connection between the solar air heater and the drying chamber is performed by means of a neoprene hose with a very low thermal conductivity in its wall. Thermal efficiency is calculated by evaluating the productivity of the dryer measuring temperature, air flow, solar radiation and loss of product mass.

40|$|Ajay K. PrasadProton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell or Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) is a {{promising}} energy conversion device {{due to its}} clean and efficient operation. Gas Diffusion Layer (GDL), a thin porous material, {{is one of its}} key components. It has been shown that by tailoring the GDL properties one can increase the PEMFC performance significantly. Characterizing the material properties is very important for material selection in a design process. The focus of this work is to experimentally measure an important property of the GDL material: permeability (or more specifically in-plane permeability, since the material is typically not isotropic). Water is the byproduct of the fuel cell reaction. During the PEMFC operation, water often condenses within the GDL pores thus hindering the gas flow and blocking the gas access to the reaction sites (catalyst layers). The main goal of our experiments is to measure the influence of the water content within the porous GDL (or, saturation) on the in-plane permeability. Convection is often a key mode of reactant transport, and its influence varies depending on the channel configuration. As the materials are porous, one can use the porous media theory of Darcy???s law to describe the convective transport for which one should first characterize the permeability of the material which is an input required in Darcy???s law which relates the flow rate through a porous material with the pressure drop experienced by the fluid. So convection is important and to model convection, one needs to measure permeability of the GDL. GDL is anisotropic; hence one must characterize in-plane (and through-plane) permeability. Water condenses in the GDL pores, so one must be able to describe permeability {{as a function of the}} saturation level. For the purpose of this investigation, the in-plane permeability of the dry GDLs was compared to the in-plane permeability of the wet (i. e. water-saturated) GDL???s for different saturation levels.. For future work, different types GDLs are to be compared to each other in addition to the effect of coating GDL with Teflon, to change the hydrophobicity level of the GDL, and its permeability and saturation level. Findings and results of this project include the measurements for plain carbon paper (TGP-H- 060 by Toray Industries, Inc.). Due to several major problems, primarily coming from the complexity of the experimental setup, accruing more reliable data for the above GDL type, as well as comparing the data for different GDL types, has been postponed for the future. During the project, we have encountered several difficulties as follows: Scale malfunction, test stand inaccuracy, a number of hidden leaks in the plumbing of humid air, and condensation of water in the <b>chamber</b> <b>manifolds.</b> All the former problems have been addressed and the only problem left to solve to get very accurate data is to find out where water condenses in the tubes. This would help explaining less water collected at the end of the experiments compare to how much it is put in. The condensation problem is greatly reduced by running experiments with dry inlet air. Exponentially increase of permeability in the beginning of the run could be due to the water being pushed out by force rather than drying over time which is actually desired. Result curves start to smooth out for permeability around 40 % saturation and flatten out until GDLs gets dry. Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the results from the}} analysis of an experimental investigation with the aim to provide insight to the cyclic, instantaneous heat transfer phenomena occurring in both the cylinder head and exhaust manifold wall surfaces of a direct injection (DI), air-cooled diesel engine. The mechanism of cyclic heat transfer is investigated during engine transient events, viz, after a sudden change in engine speed and/or load, both for the combustion <b>chamber</b> and exhaust <b>manifold</b> surfaces. These results are then compared with relevant experimental data from steady state operation which in the present case are used as reference helping to reveal any potential influences of each transient event on cyclic heat transfer. The experimental installation allowed both long- and short-term signal types to be recorded on a common time reference base during the transient event. Processing of experimental data was accomplished using a modified version of one-dimensional heat conduction theory with Fourier analysis, capable to cater for the special characteristics of transient engine operation. Based on this model, the evolution of local surface heat flux during a transient event was calculated. Two engine transient events are examined, which present a key difference in the way the load and speed changes are imposed on each one of them. From the analysis of experimental results it is confirmed that each thermal transient event consists of two distinguished phases the "thermodynamic" and the "structural" one which are appropriately configured and analyzed. In the case of a severe variation, in the first 20 cycles after the beginning of the transient event, the wall surface temperature amplitude on cylinder head was almost three times higher than the one observed at the "normal" temperature oscillations occurring during the steady state operation. At the same time, peak pressure values in the same cycles are increased by almost 15 % above their corresponding values at the final steady state. The same phenomena are valid for the exhaust manifold surfaces but on a moderated scale. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The experimental installation allowed both for long- and short-term signal types to be recorded on a common time reference base during the transient event. Processing of experimental data was accomplished using a modified version of one-dimensional heat conduction theory with Fourier analysis, capable of catering for the special characteristics of transient engine operation. Based on this model, the evolution of local surface heat flux during a transient event was calculated. Two engine transient events are examined, which present a key difference in the way the load and speed changes are imposed on each one of them. It is revealed {{that in the case of}} a 'ramp' transient the amplitude of wall surface temperature and heat flux variation in the combustion chamber during the first 20 engine cycles was increased by almost three times more than the corresponding ones during steady state operation. At the same time, temporal gradients of cylinder pressure and wall surface temperature are also sharply increased in the combustion <b>chamber</b> and exhaust <b>manifold</b> surfaces. The variation of cylinder pressure, surface temperature, and heat flux is altered significantly during the transient event, with their peak values either advanced or retarded compared with those for the corresponding steady state operation. The previous observations are moderated or even vanished in the case of a 'slow pace' transient variation, revealing the significant influence of engine speed and load triggered by the external command, on the response of heat transfer variables. During a ramp transient, the amplitude of wall temperature swing is increased significantly even at a depth of a few millimetres below the surface of the combustion chamber, thereby influencing the dissipation of heat towards its external layers. Under these circumstances, the depth of penetration for temperature oscillations inside the metal volume is also significantly increased...|$|R

It is interesting to remark how momentum equation has been taken into account in all compressor parts and the possibility to solve parallel paths, resonators, etc. Effective flow areas are evaluated considering multidimensional models based on modal analysis of fluid interaction in the valve. Then, second and third order vibration models of valve are also considered. The possibility to use compound bound has been also implemented. The force balances in the crankshaft connecting rod mechanical system are simultaneously solved at each time-step considered in the thermal and fluid dynamic compressor model. It allows to evaluate the instantaneous compression chamber volume and the different forces in the crankshaft connecting rod mechanical system. Mechanical system forces allows to know important information to predict possible over-stresses in piston, piston pin, crankshaft, connecting rod, etc. The thermal analysis of the solid elements is based on global energy balances at each macro volume considered (shell, muffler, tubes, cylinder head, crankcase, motor, etc.). Some improvements can be implemented (shell conduction, heat transfer coefficient evaluation, etc.). The resulting governing equations (fluid flow, valve dynamics, conduction heat transfer in solids, etc.) are discretized by means of a fully implicit control volume formulation. The complete set of algebraic equations are coupled using the segregated he complete set of algebraic equations are coupled using the segregated pressure based algorithm Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equations(SIMPLEC) extended to compressible flow. Second and third time order schemes have been implemented for the transient terms. An extensive hermetic reciprocating compressor experimental validation has been presented and the experimental know-how acquired has been highlighted. Furthermore, two commercial hermetic reciprocating compressor have been instrumented in detail to obtain the thermal temperatures map and the pressure fluid evolutions along compressor for different working conditions. It is interesting to remark as a novelty, the use of very small absolute pressure transducers, instead of the standard relative transducers. They allow to know instantaneous absolute pressure inside compressor chamber, without the necessity of measurement an absolute pressure outside the compression chamber (as is usual in this kind of experimental works). The global comparative results have allowed to check the possibilities of the {{numerical simulation}} presented above and its accuracy compared with experimental data. After that, this work show the capabilities offered by the simulation presented and its final objective, {{a better understanding of the}} thermal and fluid dynamic compressor behaviour to improve the design of these equipments.

Finally, a parametric study of hermetic reciprocating compressors behaviour has been carried out.

Depending on the manufacturer, these head straps may be stapled to the filter media itself. This may cause leakage through the filter media of the respirator, potentially exposing {{the user to}} an unacceptable level of contaminant. In this study, monodisperse polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres were generated to challenge four replicates of a N 95 single use respirator model made by the same manufacturer. Nominal particle sizes of the PSL spheres used to challenge the respirators were 0. 5, 1, and 2 micrometers in diameter. All respirators were sealed onto a custom built testing assembly and tested in a sealed chamber. Particle sizes of interest were generated using a nebulizer, and passed through a diffusion dryer and a Krypton- 85 radioactive source prior to entering the test chamber. The dryer reduces the humidity of the aerosol generating by the nebulizer, while the radioactive source neutralizes the charge of the aerosol cloud. The test chamber was constructed using a glass aquarium measuring 32 x 53 x 122 centimeters. Three stainless steel air diffusers were placed above the testing compartment to evenly distribute the aerosol in the <b>chamber.</b> An exhaust <b>manifold</b> was placed at {{the lower part of}} the chamber beneath another stainless steel diffuser below the area where test respirators were placed. The respirators were challenged as received from the manufacturer with 0. 5, 1 and 2 micrometer-sized (PSL) spheres. The same procedure was repeated for each respirator after sealing the areas where the head straps were stapled with silicon rubber. Testing was conducted at a flow rate of 85 liters per minute, as specified in the NIOSH respirator testing protocol.
