40|$|Toe-clipping, {{the removal}} {{of one or more}} toes, is a common method used to {{individually}} mark free-living animals. Whilst this method is widely used in studies of amphibians, the appropriateness of the method, and its potential detrimental effects {{have been the subject of}} debate. Here, we provide for the first time, evidence that toe-clipping is a stressor in a wild amphibian. We measured urinary corticosterone responses of male cane toads (Rhinella marina) to <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> handling only, and to toe-clipping under field conditions. Urinary testosterone concentrations and white blood cell proportions were also measured. Urinary corticosterone metabolite concentrations increased 6 h after <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> handling only and remained high for 24 h; corticosterone returned to baseline levels after 48 h and remained low at 72 h post <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> handling. Corticosterone concentrations in toads subjected to toe-clipping increased at 6 h to significantly higher concentrations than after <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> handling only, then decreased more slowly than after <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> handling, and were still elevated (approximately double basal level) 72 h after toe-clipping. Testosterone did not change significantly after <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> handling only, whereas after toe-clipping testosterone decreased at 6 h and remained low at 72 h. There were weak short-term effects of toe-clipping compared with <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> handling only on white blood cell proportions. We have clearly shown that toe-clipping is a distinctly stronger stressor than <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> handling alone. This indicates that there is an ethical cost of toe-clipping, and this should be considered when planning studies of amphibians. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|Bio-energy {{with carbon}} <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> storage (BECCS) is a future {{greenhouse}} gas mitigation technology which produces negative {{carbon dioxide emissions}} by combining bioenergy (energy from biomass) use with geologic carbon <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> storage.

There are other non-BECCS forms of carbon dioxide removal and storage that include technologies such as biochar, carbon dioxide air <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> biomass burial.|$|R
