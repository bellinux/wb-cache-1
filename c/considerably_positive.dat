Furthermore, geographically extended clusters, as well as clusters with a large number of LECC-funded organisations, appear on average to have a more sceptical view of the competition’s effects on the region.

40|$|Abstract. A {{series of}} tensile and load {{relaxation}} behaviors in B 2 type -CuZn alloy {{have been examined}} to clarify the strain rate & the temperature dependence of yield stress anomaly. As strain rate increased, the anomalous peak moved to a higher stress and temperature region. The anomalous yielding region below peak temperature (Tp) revealed slightly positive strain rate dependence, while the region above Tp showed <b>considerably</b> <b>positive</b> strain rate dependence. Based on the different tendency of temperature and strain rate dependence of anomalous yielding, two types of deformation modes were suggested and incorporated into the yield stress vs. temperature curve analysis, which was in accord well with the experimental results.

40|$|Abstract- Data path {{connection}} elements, such as multiplexers, {{consume a}} significant amount of area on a VLSI chip, especially for FPGA designs. Multiplexer optimization is a difficult problem because both register binding and port assignment to reduce total multiplexer connectivity during high-level synthesis are NP-complete problems. In this paper, we first formulate a k-cofamily-based register binding algorithm targeting the multiplexer optimization problem. We then further reduce the multiplexer width through an efficient port assignment algorithm. Experimental results show that we are 44 % better overall than the left-edge register binding algorithm on the total usage of multiplexer inputs and 7 % better than a bipartite graph-based algorithm. For large designs, we are able to achieve significantly better results consistently. After technology mapping, placement and routing for an FPGA architecture, it shows <b>considerably</b> <b>positive</b> impacts on chip area, delay and power consumption. I...|$|E

Two hundred and twelve students at various stages in the dental curriculum anonymously completed the Medical Condition Re-gard Scale (MCRS) for these conditions.

The results revealed that the regard of dental students was <b>considerably</b> <b>positive</b> for all the conditions except LGBT, for which it was just borderline positive. Intellectual disability received the highest regard among all the conditions and LGBT the least. An intermediary and comparable regard was noted for acute mental illness and HIV-positive status followed by substance misuse.
