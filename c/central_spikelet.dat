30|$|To {{induce the}} {{production}} of conidia, agar blocks containing mycelia of each isolate were cultured in mung bean broth (40  g of mung beans was steeped in 1  l of just boiled distilled water for 10  min. After beans were removed by cheesecloth, the filtrate was autoclaved for use.) at 25  °C and 100  rpm for 3  days (Wu et al. 2005). Conidia were filtrated through miracloth and counted by hemocytometer. The suspension was centrifuged and adjusted to 105 conidia/ml with sterilized water and used for pathogenicity tests. The local wheat cultivar, Taichung Sel. 2, was used as host plants. A seedling coleoptile inoculation method (Wu et al. 2005) was modified to quickly determine the pathogenicity of all isolates. Briefly, seedling coleoptiles were wounded by a needle, and then immersing in a conidia suspension (105 conidia/ml) for 30  min. Five seedlings were inoculated with each isolate. Inoculated seedlings were placed on wet paper towel in Petri dishes and put in moister chambers at 24  °C with 12  h light cycle. To evaluate the virulence of each isolate, 5  µl conidia suspension (105 conidia/ml) was inoculated at {{the interior of the}} two <b>central</b> <b>spikelets</b> of each head at the anthesis stage (Malbrán et al. 2012). The inoculated wheat heads were covered with plastic bags for 48  h to maintain moisture. Three replicates were conducted for each isolate. Virulence was evaluated by the number of symptomatic spikelets at the 12  days post inoculation (dpi).|$|R
40|$|A typical barley (Hordeum vulgare) floret {{consists}} of reproductive organs three stamens and a pistil, and non-reproductive organs-lodicules and two floral bracts, abaxial called 'lemma' and adaxial 'palea'. The floret is subtended by two additional bracts called outer or empty glumes. Together these organs form the basic structural {{unit of the}} grass inflorescence, a spikelet. There are commonly three spikelets at each rachis (floral stem of the barley spike) node, one central and two lateral spikelets. Rare naturally occurring or induced phenotypic variants that contain a third bract subtending the <b>central</b> <b>spikelets</b> have been described in barley. The gene responsible for this phenotype was called the THIRD OUTER GLUME 1 (Trd 1). The Trd 1 mutants fail to suppress bract growth {{and as a result}} produce leaf-like structures that subtend each rachis node in the basal portion of the spike. Also, floral development at the collar is not always suppressed. In rice and maize, recessive mutations in NECK LEAF 1 (Nl 1) and TASSEL SHEATH 1 (Tsh 1) genes, respectively, {{have been shown to be}} responsible for orthologous phenotypes. Fine mapping of the trd 1 phenotype in an F- 3 recombinant population enabled us to position on the long arm of chromosome 1 H to a 10 cM region. We anchored this to a conserved syntenic region on rice chromosome Os 05 and selected a set of candidate genes for validation by resequencing PCR amplicons from a series of independent mutant alleles. This analysis revealed that a GATA transcription factor, recently proposed to be Trd 1, contained mutations in 10 out of 14 independent trd 1 mutant alleles that would generate non-functional TRD 1 proteins. Together with genetic linkage data, we confirm the identity of Trd 1 as the GATA transcription factor ortholog of rice Nl 1 and maize Tsh 1 genes...|$|R
40|$|Wheat yield {{depends on}} the number of grains per square metre, which in turn is related to the number of fertile florets at anthesis. The {{dynamics}} of floret generation/degeneration were studied in contrasting conditions of nitrogen (N) and water availability of modern, well-adapted, durum wheats in order to understand further the bases for grain number determination. Experiments were carried out during the 2008 - 2009 and 2009 - 2010 growing seasons at Lleida (NE Spain). The first experiment involved four cultivars (Claudio, Donduro, Simeto, and Vitron) and two contrasting N availabilities (50 kgN ha(- 1) and 250 kgN ha(- 1); N 50 and N 250) while experiment 2 included the two cultivars most contrasting in grain setting responsiveness to N in experiment 1, and two levels of N (N 50 and N 250), under irrigated (IR) and rainfed (RF) conditions. In addition, a detillering treatment was imposed on both cultivars under the IR+N 250 condition. The number of fertile florets at anthesis was increased by ~ 30 % in response to N fertilization (averaging across treatments and spikelet positions). The effect of N and water availability was evident on floret developmental rates from the third floret primordium onwards, as these florets in the <b>central</b> <b>spikelets</b> of all genotypes reached the stage of a fertile floret in N 250 while in N 50 they did not. In this study, clear {{differences were found between the}} cultivars in their responsiveness to N by producing more fertile florets at anthesis (through accelerating developmental rates of floret primordia), by increasing the likelihood of particular grains to be set, or by both traits.

50|$|Foxtail barley is a fibrous-rooted, densely tufted {{grass that}} grows from 30 - 100 cm tall and is erect or {{reclining}} at the base. The stems are erect and smooth and the leaf sheaths are split and hairy. The inflorescence of the mature plant is a dense, long-awned nodding spike with greenish or purplish colouring. The jointed rachis breaks into sharply pointed segments with three spikelets composing each segment. Only the <b>central</b> <b>spikelet</b> has one creamy coloured seed while each segment has seven awns with upward pointing barbs.

This is a small annual grass forming petite patches of thin, hairy leaves and erect stems to half a meter in maximum height. The green or reddish green inflorescence is 2 to 6 centimeters long and about half a centimeter wide. Like other barleys the spikelets come in triplets. There is a large fertile <b>central</b> <b>spikelet</b> about a centimeter long and two smaller, often sterile spikelets on pedicels, each 3 to 5 millimeters long.|$|E
40|$|Wheat yield {{is largely}} {{determined}} {{during the period}} prior to flowering, when the final numbers of fertile florets and grains per spike are established. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the dynamics of floret primordia development in winter wheat in response to pre-anthesis application of a synthetic cytokinin, 6 -benzylaminopurine (6 -BA). We conducted an experiment in which two foliar spray treatments were applied (water or 6 -BA) to Chinese winter wheat at 25 days after jointing during two growing seasons (2012 - 2013 and 2013 - 2014). Both the final grain number per spike and grain yield at maturity exhibited remarkable increases in response to the 6 -BA treatment. Application of 6 -BA increased the number of fertile florets in basal spikelets and, to a greater extent, in central spikelets. The mechanism by which 6 -BA application affected the final number of fertile florets primarily involved suppression of the floret abortion rates. Application of 6 -BA considerably reduced the abortion rates of basal, central and apical spikelet florets (by as much as 77 % compared with the control), as well as the degeneration rates of basal and <b>central</b> <b>spikelet</b> florets, albeit to a lesser degree. The effect of 6 -BA application on the likelihood of proximal florets being set was limited to the distal florets in the whole spike, whereas obvious increases in the likelihood of grain set under 6 -BA treatment were observed in distal florets, primarily in <b>central</b> <b>spikelet</b> positions. The results of this study provide important evidence that 6 -BA application to florets (final fertile floret production) results in an increased grain yield...|$|E
40|$|Japanese {{angelica}} (Aralia elata L.) pollens {{were collected}} from the mature <b>central</b> open <b>spikelet</b> having visible anthers and were used for morphological observation. Scanning electron microscope revealed two distinctive types of pollen. One was comparatively larger in size and regular in shape (fertile) while the other was smaller and irregular in shape (sterile). Scanning electron microscope showed that pollen has clearly visible four apertures. It was hypothesized that potassium (K) {{may be involved in}} pollen swelling and the mechanisms underlying the rapid imbibition of water. Scanning electron microscopy with EDX (Energy dispersive X-ray) attachment was used to observe K at aperture area of pollen. It was found the K intensity were higher when the beam was passed through the aperture whereas intensity of K peaks reduced when the beam passed through the area that is between apertures. These results support our hypothesis that if K drives rapid imbibition of water then it should be located in the aperture area of pollen. These results demonstrate that a likely relationship exists between K located at the aperture and the swelling of pollen...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFurther {{increases}} in wheat yield potential {{could be achieved}} through {{a better understanding of}} the dynamics of floret primordia generation/degeneration, a process which has received little attention. We quantified genotypic variation among elite genotypes of the CIMCOG panel assembled by CIMMYT for its usefulness for wheat breeding. Ten genotypes, representing the range of variation for yield and its components of the whole panel, were grown under high-yielding conditions in NW Mexico for two growing seasons. The stage of development of floret primordia was determined 2 – 3 times weekly during stem elongation for apical, <b>central</b> and basal <b>spikelets</b> within the spike. The dynamics of floret initiation/death, and the resulting number of fertile florets, were determined for each spikelet position. We found that the variation in number of fertile florets within this elite germplasm was much more related to the survival of floret primordia than to the maximum number of florets initiated. As the two floret primordia most proximal to the rachis were almost always fertile and most distal florets (florets 6 – 8) were never fertile, the differences in number of fertile florets were clearly attributed to the differential developmental patterns of intermediate florets (floret primordia 3, 4 and 5, counted from the rachis, depending on the spikelet position). We found significant differences among elite germplasm in dynamics of floret development. Differences in floret survival seemed positively related to those in the length of the period of floret development: the longer the duration of floret development the higher the likelihood of that floret becoming fertile. It is proposed that this type of study may be instrumental for identifying prospective parents for further raising yield potential wheat breeding programmes...|$|R

40|$|Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is {{the most}} {{important}} crop grown extensively in the UK. There is a gap between yield production and world demand for wheat. So, {{there is a need to}} fill this gap. The overall objective of the present study is to investigate the physiological determinants of grain yield potential in winter wheat grown in UK conditions using doubled-haploid lines derived from a cross between winter wheat varieties Rialto and Spark. These varieties are known from previous work to contrast for source and sink type traits and for the presence/absence of the 1 BL/ IRS translocation and the Rht-Dl b semi-dwarf allele. Three field experiments (at Sutton Bonington, University of Nottingham 2003 / 4, 2004 / 5 and 2005 / 6) were conducted examining 25 DH lines of the Rialto x Spark population and the two parents. Two post-anthesis shading treatments (with and without shading) were applied to six genotypes (four DII lines and two parents) in 2003 / 4 and 2004 / 5. Two post anthesis de-graining treatments (with and without degraining) were applied to twelve genotypes (ten DH lines and two parents) in 2003 / 4 and 2004 / 5. Detailed measurements of grain growth were carried out on the two parents for five pre-determined grain positions within the ear. A range of physiological traits were measured, including developmental stages, light extinction coefficient, radiation interception, radiation-use efficiency (RUE), green area and biomass, stem water-soluble carbohydrate reserves, floret fertility, potential grain weight, grain filling rate and duration, final grain weight and combine grain yield. A source-sink balance model which quantified the source: sink balance during grain growth indicated that the four DH lines and the two parents were sink-limited during grain growth. The sink manipulation treatment (de-graining) generally confirmed the sink limitation in this population although small positive responses of grain growth to de-graining for a few lines indicated they may have been close to source limitation. Radiation-use efficiency measured as the regression slope of dry matter on accumulated PAR intercepted between onset of stem elongation and anthesis differed amongst genotypes in 2004, 2005 and 2006. Pre-anthesis RUE was positively correlated with each of grains m 2 and specific leaf weight (SLW). The 1 BL/IRS translocation increased RUE significantly. The characterisation of the 25 DH lines in this study showed that the differences in grain yield were positively correlated with grains m' 2 but not individual grain weight. There was positive correlation between stem WSC reserves and yield in one of the experimental seasons, 2006. The ten DH lines and the two parents differed in the length of the period between GS 31 and GS 61 by nine days. There was a positive correlation between the duration from GS 31 to GS 61 and radiation interception during this period which positively affecting grains m ' 2 Rate and duration of grain growth and final grain weight were assessed for five grain positions (G 1 to G 5) for Rialto and Spark under 50 % shading and a control treatment. Rialto had heavier grains associated with a longer grain filling duration than Spark. The five grain positions had similar durations of grain filling but differed in final grain weight and rate of grain growth. Grains in the <b>central</b> <b>spikelet</b> (G 1, G 2 and G 3) were sink-limited as they did not respond to de-graining. However, grains in the basal (G 4) and apical (G 5) spikelets were marginally source-limited since their final weight was increased by de-graining. These results suggest that breeders should consider selecting for extra grains in proximal grain positions in basal spikelets (e. g. G 4) rather than in distal grain positions in central spikelets, because these grains in this position were heavier, had faster filling rate and had the ability to respond to extra assimilates later in the season. Harvest biomass was positively correlated with grain yield amongst the DH lines. So traits to improve biomass whilst maintaining harvest index may be important for future breeding progress. It is suggested that breeders might select for an extended duration between GS 31 and GS 61 and higher RUE (via high SLW) to improve grains M- 2 and yield potential in future years. They also should select for higher stem carbohydrate reserves to increase source size alongside grain sink size. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
