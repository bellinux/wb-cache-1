2500|$|A <b>{{contract}}</b> <b>for</b> <b>difference</b> (CFD) is {{a two-way}} hedge or swap contract {{that allows the}} seller and purchaser to fix {{the price of a}} volatile commodity. Consider a deal between an electricity producer and an electricity retailer, both of whom trade through an electricity market pool. If the producer and the retailer agree to a strike price of $50 per MWh, for 1 MWh in a trading period, and if the actual pool price is $70, then the producer gets $70 from the pool but has to rebate $20 (the [...] "difference" [...] between the strike price and the pool price) to the retailer.|$|E
2500|$|Electricity retailers, who in {{aggregate}} buy from the wholesale market, and generators who {{in aggregate}} {{sell to the}} wholesale market, are exposed to these price and volume effects and {{to protect themselves from}} volatility, they will enter into [...] "hedge contracts" [...] with each other. The structure of these contracts varies by regional market due to different conventions and market structures. However, the two simplest and most common forms are simple fixed price forward contracts for physical delivery and contracts for differences where the parties agree a strike price for defined time periods. In the case of a <b>contract</b> <b>for</b> <b>difference,</b> if a resulting wholesale price index (as referenced in the contract) in any time period is higher than the [...] "strike" [...] price, the generator will refund the difference between the [...] "strike" [...] price and the actual price for that period. Similarly a retailer will refund the difference to the generator when the actual price is less than the [...] "strike price". The actual price index is sometimes referred to as the [...] "spot" [...] or [...] "pool" [...] price, depending on the market.|$|E
