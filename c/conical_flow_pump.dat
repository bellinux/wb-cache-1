40|$|Two-particle {{azimuthal}} correlations {{in central}} Au+Au collisional at RHIC have revealed a broad-ened away-side structure, {{with respect to}} perpherial Au+Au, pp, and d+Au. This could be ex-plained by different physics mechanisms such as: large angle gluon radiation, deflected jets, ˆCerenkov gluon radiation, and <b>conical</b> <b>flow</b> generated by hydrodynamic shock-waves. We can discriminate the scenarios with conical emission, ˆCerenkov radiation and <b>conical</b> <b>flow,</b> from the other mechanisms though three-particle correlations. In addition, the associated particle pT de-pendence {{can be used to}} distinguish <b>conical</b> <b>flow</b> from simple ˆCerenkov gluon radiation. We will discuss three-particle correlation analyses that have been performed at RHIC {{and what can be done}} at the LHC. High-pT physics at LH...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effects of jet {{quenching}} on the hydrodynamical evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) fluid created in a heavy-ion collision. In jet quenching, a hard QCD parton, before fragmenting into a jet of hadrons, deposits a fraction of its energy in the medium, leading to suppressed production of high-pT hadrons. Assuming that the deposited energy quickly thermalizes, we simulate the subsequent hydrodynamic evolution of the QGP fluid. For partons moving at supersonic speed, v_p > c_s, and sufficiently large energy loss, a shock wave forms leading to <b>conical</b> <b>flow</b> [1]. The PHENIX Collaboration recently suggested that observed structures in the azimuthal angle distribution [2] might be caused by <b>conical</b> <b>flow.</b> We show here that <b>conical</b> <b>flow</b> produces different angular structures than predicted in [1] and that, for phenomenologically acceptable values of parton energy loss, <b>conical</b> <b>flow</b> effects are too weak to explain the structures seen by PHENIX [2]. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures. Last figure changed, now showing angular distribution of pions instead of photons. Added comments on "lost jets" and pT-dependence of angular correlation...|$|R

At present China is lack of the system theory and method to design axial <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> above 1400 specific speed. Selection methods of design parameters depend on experience. This paper used the improved lifting method to design axial <b>flow</b> <b>pump.</b> Optimize design of axial <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> from cascade solidity, blade number, ratio hub and the airfoil of impeller. The feasibility of such optimize methods had been validated from theoretical analysis. Put forward new selection methods of design parameters. Design an impeller model.

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of the existence of}} a viscous vortex in a <b>conical</b> <b>flow</b> is discussed. Existence of a viscous vortex is shown to be consistent with a flow-field model where only the velocity components and the total enthalpy behave conically. Existence of a viscous vortex is not consistent with the fully conical, flow-field model; however, far from the nose tip, the physical flow quantities tend to behave asymptotically as a full <b>conical</b> <b>flow.</b> Such a viscous vortex, when it exists, must spiral inwards to the focal point.

Numerical results show that: different flow operating conditions will lead to different Rotor/Stator interaction phenomenon, and also different pressure fluctuation.

40|$|Two-particle {{correlations}} {{have shown}} modification to the away-side shape in central Au+Au collisions relative to pp, d+Au and peripheral Au+Au collisions. Different scenarios can explain this modification including: large angle gluon radiation, jets deflected by transverse flow, path length dependent energy loss, Cerenkov gluon radiation of fast moving particles, and <b>conical</b> <b>flow</b> generated by hydrodynamic Mach-cone shock-waves. Three-particle correlations {{have the power}} to distinguish the scenarios with <b>conical</b> emission, <b>conical</b> <b>flow</b> and Cerenkov radiation, from other scenarios. In addition, the dependence of the observed shapes on the p_T of the associated particles can be used to distinguish conical emission from a sonic boom (Mach-cone) and from QCD-Cerenkov radiation. We present results from STAR on 3 -particle azimuthal correlations for a high p_T trigger particle with two softer particles. Results are shown for pp, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at √(s_NN) = 200 GeV. An important aspect of the analysis is the subtraction of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction and the flow harmonics v 2 and v 4 are investigated in detail. The implications of the results for {{the presence or absence of}} <b>conical</b> <b>flow</b> from Mach-cones are discussed.

40|$|Summary. [...] The {{formation}} of a conical shock and a <b>conical</b> region of <b>flow</b> separation originating {{from the tip of}} a. tifin traversing tube was observed in a supersonic tunnel as a result of interaction of a strong shock with the boundary layer on tile tube surface. The angles of the conical shock and separation surfaces and the static pressure in the sepaiation region are in good agreement with the theoretical <b>conical</b> <b>flow</b> solutions. The extent of the <b>conical</b> <b>flow</b> illustrated should act as a warning against the use of static pressure tubes for measuring pressmes in the regions of strong shocks. 1. Introduction.
