40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess how technology-based {{university}} research drives innovation in Europe and China. Design/methodology/approach – This paper draws on extensive theoretical research and literature reviews, and presents a framework based on theories on networking, knowledge creation and innovation. It then introduces three European cases to illustrate practical applications of the framework, and also links the ﬁndings to three Chinese cases to make comparative observations as well as recommendations related to Triple Helix concepts and their implications in the China context. It addresses the issue of how learning from universities can enhance company ﬂexibility and performance in innovation, and outlines three different models of collaboration. Findings – The framework and empirical research suggests that weak ties are useful for inspiration in exploration, but that strong industry-university (I-U) ties are required to support exploitation. This ﬁnding applies both to Europe and China in the industries covered. Originality/value – This paper provides a new theoretical rationale for I-U learning alliances as a natural way out from the managerial problem of trying to perform both exploration and exploitation within the same company boundaries. Through the theoretical framework, the academic science domain becomes a logical partner to handle the full phase of exploration and support the process of exploitation. The presented European <b>cases</b> of <b>Bang</b> & Olufsen, Combibloc and Porsche offer new insights into how to perform this act in practice, while the three China-related cases allow us to cross analyse empirical ﬁndings and draw initial conclusions with policy implications for China...|$|R

40|$|We study various {{equilibrium}} {{thermodynamic properties}} of blackbody radiation (i. e. a photon gas) with an ultraviolet energy cut-off. We {{find that the}} energy density, specific heat etc. follow usual acoustic phonon dynamics as have been well studied by Debye. Other thermodynamic quantities like pressure, entropy etc. have also been calculated. The usual Stefan-Boltzmann law gets modified. We observe that {{the values of the}} thermodynamic quantities with the energy cut-off is lower than the corresponding values in the theory without any such scale. The phase-space measure is also expected to get modified for an exotic spacetime appearing at Planck scale, which in turn leads to the modification of Planck energy density distribution and the Wien's displacement law. We found that the non-perturbative nature of the thermodynamic quantities in the SR limit (for both the case with ultravilolet cut-off and the modified measure case), due to nonanalyticity of the leading term, is a general feature of the theory accompanied with an ultraviolet energy cut-off. We have also discussed the possible modification in the <b>case</b> of Big <b>Bang</b> and the Stellar objects and have suggested a table top experiment for verification in effective low energy case.

40|$|Based on the {{equivalence}} of the {{two different}} types of measurement protocols and the asymmetry between the Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures, it has been previously proposed that negative sea fills the universe as a nondeterministic computation - a time-reversal process of the irreversible computations presented since the big bang. The goal {{of this paper is to}} extend the proposed subjective universe model, i. e., the universe as a quantum measurement: Motivated by the relationship between quantum theory and classical probability theory with continuity, it is argued that the frame of reference of the observer may be identified with classical probability theory where its choice, along with big bang singularity, should correspond to the quantum observable. That is, the physical version of singularity resolution corresponds to the <b>case,</b> where big <b>bang</b> singularity is equivalent to the continuity of the negative sea, or aether, filling the universe as a frame of reference of the observer. Moreover, based on the holographic principle, we identify the choice of the observer with the degrees of freedom proportional to the Planck area on the horizon. We also discuss that the continuity or infinity present in every formal language of choice acceptable in nondeterministic computation may be associated with the universal grammar proposed by Chomsky in linguistics.

40|$|Urban {{environmental}} depletion {{has been}} a critical problem among industrialized-transformed societies, especially {{at the local level}} where administrative authorities’ capacity lags behind changes. Derived from governance concept, the idea of civil society inclusion is highlighted. Focusing on an agglomerated <b>case</b> study, <b>Bang</b> Plee Community in Thailand, this research investigates on a non-state sector, 201 -Community organization, as an agent for changes to improve urban environments on solid waste collection. Two roles are contested: as an agent for neighborhood internal change and as an intermediary toward governance changes in state-civil society interaction. By employing longitudinal analysis via a project intervention as research experiment, the outcomes of both roles are detected portrayed in three spheres: state, state-civil society interaction, and civil society sphere. It discovers in the research regarding agglomerated context that as an internal changes for environmental betterment, 201 -Community organization operation brings on waste reduction at the minimal level. Community-based organization as an agent for changes – despite capacity input it still limited in efficiency and effectiveness – can mobilize fruitfully only at the individual and network level of civil society sectors, while fails managing at the organizational level. The positive outcomes result by economic waste incentive associated with a limited-bonded group rather than the rise of awareness at large. As an intermediary agent for shared governance, the community-based organization cannot bring on mutual dialogue with state as much as cannot change the state’s operation arena of solid waste management. The findings confine the shared governance concept that it does not applicable in agglomerated locality as an effective outcome, both in terms of being instrumental toward civil society inclusion and being provocative of internal change. Shared environmental governance as summarized in this research can last merely a community development action. It distances significantly from civil society inclusion and empowerment. However, the research proposes that community-based environmental management and shared governance toward civil society inclusion in urban environmental improvement are still an expectable option and reachable if their factors and conditions of key success and failure are intersected with a particular context. Further studies demand more precise on scale, scope, and theses factors of environmental management operation operated by civil society sectors. DAAD, CIDA-AIT Partnershi...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the {{framework}} of superstring compactifications with N= 1 supersymmetry spontaneously broken (by either geometrical fluxes, branes or else), we show the existence of new inflationary solutions. The time-trajectory of the scale factor of the metric a, the supersymmetry breaking scale m≡m(Φ) and the temperature T are such that am and aT remain constant. These solutions request the presence of special moduli-fields: (i) The universal “no-scale-modulus” Φ, which appears in all N= 1 effective supergravity theories and defines the supersymmetry breaking scale m(Φ). (ii) The modulus Φs, which appears in a very large class of string compactifications and has a Φ-dependent kinetic term. During the time evolution, a 4 ρs remains constant as well (ρs being the energy density induced by the motion of Φs). The cosmological term Λ(am), the curvature term k(am,aT) and the radiation term cR=a 4 ρ are dynamically generated in a controllable way by radiative and temperature corrections; they are effectively constant during the time evolution. Depending on Λ, k and cR, either a first or second order phase transition can occur in the cosmological scenario. In the first case, an instantonic Euclidean solution exists and connects via tunneling the inflationary evolution to another cosmological branch. The latter starts with a big bang and, in the case the transition does not occur, ends with a big crunch. In the second <b>case,</b> the big <b>bang</b> and the inflationary phase are smoothly connected...|$|R
40|$|With {{a method}} {{in which the}} Friedmann {{equation}} is written in a form such that evolution of the scale factor can be treated {{as that of a}} particle in a "potential", we classify all possible cosmic evolutions in the DGP braneworld scenario with the dark radiation term retained. By assuming that the energy component is pressureless matter, radiation or vacuum energy, respectively, we find that in the matter or vacuum energy dominated case, the scale factor has a minimum value $a_ 0 $. In the matter dominated <b>case,</b> the big <b>bang</b> singularity can be avoided in some special circumstances, and there may exist an oscillating universe or a bouncing one. If the cosmic scale factor is in the oscillating region initially, the universe may undergo an oscillation. After a number of oscillations, it may evolve to the bounce point through quantum tunneling and then expand. However, if the universe contracts initially from an infinite scale, it can turn around and then expand forever. In the vacuum energy dominated case, there exists a stable Einstein static state to avoid the big bang singularity. However, in certain circumstances in the matter or vacuum energy dominated case, a new kind of singularity may occur at $a_ 0 $ {{as a result of the}} discontinuity of the scale factor. In the radiation dominated case, the universe may originate from the big bang singularity, but a bouncing universe which avoids this singularity is also possible. Comment: 25 pages, 24 figures.

40|$|With {{the primary}} {{ambition}} {{to contribute to}} the brand orientation literature this thesis explores relationships between corporate brand identities and the management of design innovation. The thesis is based partly on a prolonged empirical <b>case</b> study of <b>Bang</b> & Olufsen and partly on a multiple case study of small and medium sized design-oriented firms – all characterised by a strategic focus on managing market-driving innovation. Grounded in an interpretive analytical approach the thesis examines how corporate brand identity as a strategic logic of the firm affects flows of management decisions and the structuring of design innovation strategies and implementation hereof. The thesis’ theoretical foundation is anchored in the competence-based view on firm competitiveness. This foundation is complemented by institutional and organisational culture theories to the purpose of uncovering how organisational decision-makers are affected by corporate brand logics in relation to the management of design innovation processes and capabilities. The thesis presents four papers, which contribute conceptually and empirically to advance the brand orientation literature from a competence-based perspective focused on design and innovation management. Overall, findings suggest that corporate brand identity as a competitive logic in brand- and design-oriented firms can guide innovation strategy and decisions for coordinating management processes and the use of resources to develop brandsupportive innovation capabilities. However, it is also suggested that such brand logics should be complemented by market logics in a dynamic interplay. In this way a more pragmatic approach is achieved to the sustainment of innovation capabilities, which in an integrative manner support firm corporate brand identity and market adaptability as complementary management foci for customer value creation and sustained competitive advantages...|$|R
