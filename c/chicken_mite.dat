50|$|Dermanyssus gallinae (also {{known as}} the red mite, poultry mite, red poultry mite, roost mite and <b>chicken</b> <b>mite)</b> is an {{ectoparasite}} of poultry and other bird species.|$|E
50|$|The dermanyssid mites {{are visible}} to the naked eye and have long {{powerful}} legs that they use to seek their hosts. These mites live in the nest of their hosts or within the fabric of poultry houses. They infest their hosts whilst feeding for short periods. Their mouthparts are long complex organs adapted for piercing their host's skin and sucking blood. Dermanyssus gallinae, the red <b>chicken</b> <b>mite</b> is typical. Dense infestations of a poultry house cause much biting stress and loss of production to the birds, and human workers in the houses are bitten. Originally a parasite centered on the nest of its host, this species has become a major pest in commercial poultry houses. A similar genus is Ornithonyssus; O.bursa, the tropical fowl mite, and O.sylvarium the northern fowl mite cause similar problems in poultry production.|$|E

40|$|Background: Blood sucking mites are {{important}} avian ectoparasites which being found on bird species worldwide. Their presence are problematic for the producers either through potential direct effects on weight gain, egg produc&shy;tion, sperm production in roosters or as nuisance pests on worker handle hens and eggs. The {{aim of this}} study was pointing out of the status of haematophagus mites. "nMethods: Eight caged layer and four breeder flocks were visited, monitoring for the presence of <b>chicken</b> <b>mites</b> per&shy;formed by removing and examining debris from poultry house, infested nesting material collected into zip lock plas&shy;tic bags and at least 20 birds were also randomly selected to examine the presence of <b>chicken</b> <b>mites.</b> Mites obtained from each population were mounted in Hoyer,s medium on microscope slides and identified. All eight caged layer and four breeder flocks were inspected, which were infested with <b>chicken</b> blood feeding <b>mites.</b> "nResults: Massive infestations of Dermanyssus gallinae were common with huge numbers of parasites on birds, cages and the conveyor belts for egg. Only one farm from Mazandaran Province was infested to Ornithonyssus bursa. "nConclusion: Dermanyssus gallinae was the most prevalent blood feeder mite in the breeder and caged layer flocks in Iran, while O. bursa was reported as a first record, which found only in a breeder flock in Mazanderan Province. It seems that its presence is limited into the area which affected by both warm and humid environmental conditions. &nbsp;Keywords: Dermanyssus gallinae, Ornithonyssus bursa, Poultry, Ira...|$|R
40|$|The {{two very}} common parasites, the <b>chicken</b> <b>mite</b> and the chicken louse, arc {{responsible}} for a very {{large part of the}} loss suffered annually by poultry raisers, yet they may be dealt with effectively. The symptoms for these two pests are much alike. In severe cases they are as follows: The head and comb become pale, the bird looks sickly, its feathers become ruined and may drop out, it becomes dumpish and thin, and, if it is a female; It may stop laying. Sitting hens may leave the nest; sometimes they die from the effects of these parasites. Generally, the fowls may be seen picking at their feathers as If to remove the insects. To make sure of the presence of either lice or mites, catch the birds and examine them. The lice may be found on them either day or night; the mites usually attack the chickens at night only and during the day stay In cracks In the poultry house {{as well as in the}} droppings.

40|$|Assessment of ectoparasitic {{infestation}} in chickens raised under {{intensive care}} system was un-dertaken {{to determine their}} prevalence in three poultry farms in the Sunyani West District of Ghana from December, 2011 to April, 2012. With {{the aid of a}} magnifying glass, various body areas of chickens were examined for the presence of ectoparasites. All matured chickens aged 72 to 82 weeks harboured lice species identified to be Menacanthus stramineus and Menopon galli-nae. Co-infestations with <b>chicken</b> <b>mite,</b> Dermanyssusgallinae, in 43. 8 % and 36. 5 % of matured chickens from Farms 2 and 3 respectively were observed. However, lower lice infestation in growers aged 24 to 40 weeks from Farms 1 (72 %), 2 (62. 7 %) and 3 (73. 3 %), and no mite infesta-tion were observed. All growers from the three farms had significantly higher prevalence in the ventral, wing, cloacal and tail areas compared with femoral, head and neck areas of their bodies. In Farm 1, the cloacal and tail areas of chickens had significantly higher prevalence than the head and neck areas (χ (1) = 176. 74, p< 0. 001). The study revealed high prevalence of ectopara-sitic infestation in chickens of all age groups in all the poultry farms. This threatens their health and productive potential as well as the viability of the poultry industry. Regular examination of the highly infested body areas may help poultry farmers detect and control ectoparasitic infesta-tion or re-infestation early to maintain good health and increase the productive potential of chickens in the Sunyani West District...|$|E
40|$|Abstract	The {{present in}} vitro study shows the {{efficacy}} of two antimite products (ByeMite® = phoxim, Mite-Stop® = neem seed extract) against all developing stages of the important red <b>chicken</b> <b>mite</b> Dermanyssus gallinae (obtained at two farms in France and Germany). While permanent contact with the active compound led to an efficacy of 100 % {{in the case of}} Mite-Stop® on mites in both farms, there was only a 96. 2 % killing effect of ByeMite® on the mites of the French farm. Even short contacts of only 4 s killed 100 % of mites in the case of Mite-Stop® at the French farm and only 84. 5 % in the German farm. ByeMite®, on the other hand, killed only 27. 8 % (Germany) and 30 % (France) when mites got the chance to escape from the treated grounds to untreated ones. When using only the half doses of both products, Mite-Stop® still reached, after permanent contact, 100 % activity on the German farm and 98. 2 % in France, while ByeMite® killed 93. 8 % (Germany) and 90. 6 % (France). Short contact to half doses of course reduced the activity of both products (Mite- Stop®= 59. 3 % in France, 22. 1 % in Germany; ByeMite®= 28. 8 % in France, 18. 8 % in Germany). With respect to the fumigant activity of the products, the strains of D. gallinae reacted differently.

40|$|Transmission of {{the virus}} of St. Louis {{encephalitis}} to normal chickens by the bite of infected mites (Dermanyssus gallinae) has been demonstrated. Both experimentally infected and naturally infected mites were shown {{to be capable of}} transferring the virus of St. Louis encephalitis to chickens by bite. Virus is present in the blood of such chickens in small amounts, so that demonstration of viremia was possible only by utilizing chorioallantoic passage in hens' eggs. However, there is sufficient virus present in the blood for uninfected <b>chicken</b> <b>mites</b> to acquire the virus by feeding on chickens in which viremia has resulted from previous bite of infected mites. Thus {{it has been shown that}} the arachnid vector Dermanyssus gallinae is capable of transmitting the virus of St. Louis encephalitis to normal chickens by bite and that such chickens can serve as a source of virus for uninfected mites...|$|R
40|$|A {{colony of}} <b>chicken</b> <b>mites</b> (Dermanyssus gallinae) was {{established}} {{from a single}} adult female mite and her offspring. This colony of mites was shown {{to be free of}} the virus of St. Louis encephalitis. Infection of mites from this homogeneous colony with the virus of St. Louis encephalitis was accomplished by feeding on chickens having viremia. The virus was recovered as readily from mites which had not been allowed to feed for 8 days as from mites freshly engorged, showing that the demonstration of virus in the mites does not depend on the presence of fresh infective chicken blood. Transovarian passage of the St. Louis virus into the second generation has been demonstrated in mites infected experimentally. The female mite infected as an adult can pass the St. Louis virus through eggs laid after additional feeding on normal blood. Persistence of the virus for a period of 6 months has been shown in a colony of mites infected experimentally in the laboratory...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chicken</b> <b>mites</b> (Dermanyssus gallinae) {{collected}} in several localities in St. Louis County have been fbund to be {{infected with the}} virus of St. Louis encephalitis (1, 2). The infection is probably permanent since congenital transfer of the virus in these mites has been demonstrated. Persistence of the virus in nature is indicated likewise by isolation of the virus from mites collected at a single site at intervals of 6, 8, and 16 weeks and by persistence of the virus for many months in laboratory colonies, one established with mites found infected in nature (31 months) and one established with experimentally infected mites (21 months). Experimental infection of mites from a homogeneous colony of uninfected mites derived from a single female, was accomplished by aUowing them to feed on chickens having viremia following subcutaneous inoculation of the virus. Transovarlan passage in these experimentally infected mites has been demonstrated (3). However, before these observations can be considered significant in the epidemiology of St. Louis encephalitis, {{it is necessary to}} show that infected mite...|$|R
40|$|THE {{most widely}} used {{controls}} for <b>chicken</b> lice and <b>mites</b> were de-veloped {{more than two decades}} ago (Bishopp and Wagner, 1931; Cleveland, 1923; Cutright, 1929). These control meas-ures are in part fairly effective but they are by no means completely satisfactory. Experimental data on the effectiveness of certain of these conventional methods is lacking. Likewise, little is known of the efficiency of the new organic insecticides under field conditions. Nearly all the important papers deal with tests con-ducted in the laboratory. This study was conducted for the pur-pose of determining the effectiveness of certain of the more promising synthetic organic insecticides when applied by a convenient method against natural infes-tations of the economically important species of <b>chicken</b> lice and <b>mites.</b> Certain of the insecticides showing promise against lice and certain of those showing promise against mites were combined in an effort to find an all-purpose material.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{northern}} {{fowl mite}} (NFM; Ornithonyssus sylviarum) is a blood-feeding ectoparasite of birds and a major pest of poultry in the United States. Mite populations spread rapidly in commercial flocks, reach peak burdens of > 70, 000 mites per bird and have developed resistance to many pesticides. Despite decades as a pest in the United States, the reproductive biology of NFM remains unclear. Based on karyotypes, the NFM has haplodiploid sex determination, which suggests unmated females could produce male offspring (arrhenotoky). Thus, unmated females could disseminate to a new host and initiate an infestation by producing and mating with sons (oedipal mating). Methods We used small capsules to isolate and recover NFM on host <b>chickens.</b> <b>Mites</b> in capsules could blood feed, develop and reproduce, but could not contact other mites. Individual larvae were matured in isolation to produce known, unmated females. We evaluated reproduction of (I) previously mated females (i) in isolation, or (ii) paired with a male, and (II) unmated (virgin) females in isolation. In each treatment we recorded the number and sexes of offspring produced over time. Results Mated NFM produced female and male offspring in isolation, or when paired with a male. When paired with a male, females produced a female-biased sex ratio of the offspring (F:M ratio ~ 5 : 1). Unmated, female NFM produced exclusively male offspring when in isolation. When paired with their sons that had developed to maturity, the "virgin" females were able to mate and subsequently produce female offspring. Conclusions This study found that females with immediate access to sperm produced mostly female offspring. Virgin female NFM initially produced only male offspring and subsequently used oedipal mating to produce female offspring. Using this reproductive system NFM could successfully colonize new hosts as immature, or unmated females. The strong female-biased sex ratio of NFM populations suggests {{a large proportion of}} the parasite population is capable of disseminating to new hosts, which is essential for an obligate parasite to persist. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceis the causative {{agent of}} {{erysipelas}} in mammals and birds, especially pigs and poultry. In order {{to investigate the}} suitability of different subtyping methods for genetic and phenotypic similarities among Swedish isolates of the organism, 45 isolates from poultry (= 23), pigs (= 17), emus (= 2) and the poultry red mite (= 3) were investigated by serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Sequence analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene was performed on eleven isolates from nine animal species. The results indicated a random scattering of serotypes throughout the dendrogram based on PFGE banding patterns following I digestion. In three cases, isolates with an identical PFGE pattern were of differing serotypes. No differentiation into subgroups by antimicrobial susceptibility testing by broth microdilution was possible as results were similar for all isolates. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations for most antimicrobials, including penicillin and oxytetracycline, were low. The 16 S rRNA gene sequences (1443 nts) from eight of eleven selected isolates of spp. were identical {{to that of the}} type strain ATCC 19414. The other three isolates differed from the type strain by two or three nucleotides. While this method may be useful for identification of spp., it is unsuitable for epidemiological investigations. Similarities in PFGE banding patterns between isolates from <b>chickens</b> and <b>mites</b> supported the hypothesis that may act as a reservoir and vector for.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify different ectoparasites infesting 280 chicken (native breed out door house reared layers, 6 months – 2 years old), from various regions of Mosul city (poultry market, Hadba' Flock, and six flocks at Kogialli village), for one year. Total percentage of ectoparasites in chickens were 19. 3 % of which (54 positive case out of 280 chicken) 81 % were single infections and 19 % mixed infections. Lice infestation (12. 5 %) and four types of chewing lice were classified (Menacanthus stramineus, Cuclotogaster hetrographus, Goniocoteus gallinae, and Columbicola columbae). One species of flies (1. 4 %) (Pseudolynchia canariensis). One species of mites (4. 3 %) (Dermanyssus gallinae) were seen. One species of soft ticks (6. 8 %) (Argas persicus) were seen. Parasitological findings of skin and feathers examination for all types of ectoparasites on chicken showed three degrees of infestation depending on the number of these ectoparasites on each bird (low degree 1 – 50 / bird, moderate degree 51 – 100 / bird, and heavy degree more than 100 / bird). Clinical signs of the infected chicken with ectoparasites especially severe infection were itching, annoyance, loss of sleep, general weakness, loss of appetite, restless, allergy, drop of egg production in layers and anemia. It clear from results of blood examinations the presence of anemia in infected birds blood sucking ectoparasites with significant decrease in PCV %, TRBC and Hb concentration in chicken especially in severe (heavily) infestation with soft ticks and mites.
