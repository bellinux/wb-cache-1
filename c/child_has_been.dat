5|$|Rotavirus A, which {{accounts}} for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide. Each year rotavirus causes millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries, almost 2million of which result in hospitalisation. In 2013, an estimated 215,000 children younger than five died from rotavirus, 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every <b>child</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> infected with rotavirus by age five. Rotavirus is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, is responsible for {{about a third of the}} cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys are twice as likely as girls to be admitted to hospital for rotavirus.|$|E

25|$|In the United States alone—before {{initiation}} of the rotavirus vaccination programme—over 2.7million cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis occurred annually, 60,000 children were hospitalised and around 37 {{died from the}} results of the infection. The major role of rotavirus in causing diarrhoea is not widely recognised within the public health community, particularly in developing countries. Almost every <b>child</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> infected with rotavirus by age five. It is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, being responsible for about 20% of cases, and accounts for 50% of the cases requiring hospitalisation. Rotavirus causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys are twice as likely as girls to be admitted to hospital.|$|E

25|$|Twenty-five of the 34 cases {{listed in}} the {{previous}} Compliance Report have been closed, with approximately one-third resulting in {{the return of the}} children to the United States. There have been ten Hague court hearings since Fall 1999, with all children except one returned to the U.S. In one case, children were returned to the United States only six months after the abduction. In addition, there have been voluntary returns in more than 30 cases, with the existence of a pending Hague case a factor in the voluntary return decision. Once a <b>child</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> located, the taking parent must be notified of the hearing date. Mexico’s new procedure of taking children into custody at that time has been very effective in ensuring that the taking parent does not go into hiding with the children.|$|E
25|$|Traditional phonics {{instruction}} has marked benefits. Early reading {{often involves}} significant expansion of a child's mental lexicon, which includes {{all the words}} the <b>child</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> exposed to and their meanings. By focusing {{on the principle of}} linking specific sounds and characters, the child has the ability to recognize new words and derive meaning from them. Being able to adapt what they know about language to new words they experience is crucial to expanding their mental lexicon; this allows for productive reading that is the ability to read new words. It also produces higher achievement for beginning readers and the difference is the greatest for those at risk of failing to learn to read. While some children are able to infer these rules on their own, some need explicit instructions on phonics rules. Overall, children who are directly taught phonics are better at reading, spelling and comprehension.|$|E

The idea of solo releases emanated from the group's manager, Beyoncé's father, Mathew Knowles. Kelly Rowland further explained {{in an interview that}} Destiny's <b>Child</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> present in the media {{for a long time and}} they wanted to [...] "give the public eye a rest from DC for a minute".

500|$|The {{physical}} effects {{used to create}} the deformed child have been kept secret. The projectionist {{who worked on the}} film's dailies was blindfolded by Lynch to avoid revealing the prop's nature, and he has refused to discuss the effects in subsequent interviews. The prop—which Nance nicknamed [...] "Spike"—featured several working parts; its neck, eyes and mouth were capable of independent operation. Lynch has offered cryptic comments on the prop, at times stating that [...] "it was born nearby" [...] or [...] "maybe it was found". It has been speculated by The Guardian John Patterson that the prop may have been constructed from a skinned rabbit or a lamb fetus. The <b>child</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> seen as a precursor to elements of other Lynch films, such as John Merrick's make-up in 1980's The Elephant Man and the sandworms of 1984's Dune.|$|E

In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought out actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Lea Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening. The role of Rachel was written specifically for Michele. In an interview with The Washington Post, Michele commented on her casting, saying, [...] "I was kind of just thrown into this—this {{is one of the}} first television jobs I've ever had. Of course being able to sing helps bring a sense of comfort. The character I'm playing is really outgoing—she performs in her everyday life as though she's performing in front of a huge audience." ...|$|E

Ciara {{was inspired to}} pursue a career in music after seeing Destiny's Child perform on television. Ariana Grande cited Destiny's Child as one of her vocal inspirations, saying that listening to the group's music is how she discovered her range and [...] "learned about harmonies and runs and ad-libs." [...] Meghan Trainor stated that her single [...] "No" [...] (2016) was inspired by the late 1990s and early 2000s sounds of Destiny's Child, NSYNC, and Britney Spears. Fifth Harmony cited Destiny's Child as their biggest inspiration, and even paid tribute to the group by performing a medley of [...] "Say My Name", [...] "Independent Women", [...] "Bootylicious" [...] and [...] "Survivor" [...] on the television show Greatest Hits. Fifth Harmony also incorporated elements of the intro from [...] "Bootylicious" [...] for the intro to their own song [...] "Brave, Honest, Beautiful" [...] (2015).|$|E

500|$|Bowlby {{used the}} phrase [...] "mother (or {{permanent}} mother substitute)". As it is commonly used, the term maternal deprivation is ambiguous as {{it is unclear whether}} the deprivation is that of the biological mother, of an adoptive or foster mother, a consistent caregiving adult of any gender or relationship to the child, of an emotional relationship, or of the experience of the type of care called [...] "mothering" [...] in many cultures. Questions about the exact meaning of this term are by no means new, as the following statement by Mary Ainsworth in 1962 indicates: [...] "Although in the early months of life it is the mother who almost invariably interacts most with the child ... the role of other figures, especially the father, is acknowledged to be significant ... aternal deprivation ... has received scant attention ... institutionalization ... the term 'parental deprivation' would have been more accurate, for the <b>child</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> ... deprived of interaction with a father-figure as well as a mother-figure ... discourage the use of [...] and encourage the substitution of the terms 'insufficiency', 'discontinuity', and 'distortion' instead." [...] Ainsworth implies, neither the word [...] "maternal" [...] nor the word [...] "deprivation" [...] seems to be a literally correct definition of the phenomenon under consideration.|$|E
