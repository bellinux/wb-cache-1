40|$|By {{algebraic}} group theory, {{there is}} a map from <b>the</b> semisimple conjugacy <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> a finite group of Lie type to <b>the</b> conjugacy <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Weyl group. Picking a semisimple class uniformly at random yields a probability measure on conjugacy <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Weyl group.
