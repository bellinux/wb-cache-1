Despite the {{continuing}} interest in health economic research, {{we could find}} no accessible data set on cost-effectiveness, useful as practical information to decision makers who must allocate scarce resources within the cardiovascular field. The aim {{of this paper was}} to present <b>cost-effectiveness</b> <b>ratios,</b> based on a systematic literature search for the treatment of heart diseases. Design. A comprehensive literature search on cost-effectiveness analyses of intervention strategies for the treatment of heart diseases was conducted. We compiled available <b>cost-effectiveness</b> <b>ratios</b> for different heart conditions and treatment strategies, in a cost-effectiveness ranking table. The <b>cost-effectiveness</b> <b>ratios</b> were expressed as a cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) or life year gained. Results. <b>Cost-effectiveness</b> <b>ratios,</b> ranging from dominant to those costing more than 1, 000, 000 Euros per QALY gained, and bibliographic references are provided for. The table was categorized according to disease group, making the ranking table readily available. Conclusions. Cost-effectiveness ranking tables provide a means of presenting cost-effectiveness evidence.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{cost-effectiveness}} of tobacco control policy for different socioeconomic status (SES) groups. We aimed to evaluate SES-specific <b>cost-effectiveness</b> <b>ratios</b> of policies with known favorable effect in low-SES groups: a tobacco tax increase and reimbursement of cessation support. A computer model of the adult population specified by smoking behavior (never/current/former smoker), age, gender, and SES simulated policy scenarios reflecting the implementation of a € 0. 22 tobacco tax increase or full reimbursement of cessation support, which were compared. Relating differences in costs to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained generated <b>cost-effectiveness</b> <b>ratios</b> for each SES group. In a cohort of 11 million people, the tobacco tax increase resulted in 27, 000 additional quitters after 5 years, who were proportionally divided among the SES groups. Reimbursement led to 59, 000 additional quitters, with relatively more quitters in higher-SES groups. The number of QALYs gained were 3, 400 - 6, 200 among the various SES groups for the tax increase and 6, 300 - 14, 000 for the reimbursement scenario. For both interventions, favorability of the <b>cost-effectiveness</b> <b>ratios</b> increased with SES: costs per QALY decreased from € 6, 100 to € 4, 500 for the tax increase and from € 21, 000 to € 11, 000 for reimbursement. The reimbursement policy produced the greatest overall health gain. Surprisingly, neither tax increase nor reimbursement reduced health disparities.

50|$|Many {{people feel}} that basing health care {{interventions}} on cost-effectiveness {{is a type of}} health care rationing and have expressed concern that using ICER will limit the amount or types of treatments and interventions available to patients. Currently, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) of England's National Health Service (NHS) uses cost-effectiveness studies to determine if new treatments or therapies provide better value relative to the treatment that is currently in use. With the number of cost-effectiveness studies rising, it is expected for a <b>cost-effectiveness</b> <b>ratio</b> threshold to be established for the acceptance of reimbursement or formulary listing. However, there is currently no evidence that health care systems have determined such a threshold; without such a standard, the interpretation of ICER analyses may not be uniform.|$|E
50|$|The {{incremental}} <b>cost-effectiveness</b> <b>ratio</b> (ICER) is {{the ratio}} between {{the difference in}} costs and the difference in benefits of two interventions. The ICER may be stated as (C1 - C0)/(E1 - E0) in a simple example where C0 and E0 represent the cost and gain, respectively, from taking no health intervention action. C1 and E1 would represent the cost and gain, respectively of taking a specific action. So, an example in which the costs and gains, respectively, are $140,000 and 3.5 QALYs, would yield a value of $40,000 per QALY. These values are often used by policy makers and hospital administrators to determine relative priorities when determining treatments for disease conditions.

This study estimated the cost-effectiveness ratios of eight Campylobacter interventions on broiler farms in six European countries: Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and United Kingdom. The <b>cost-effectiveness</b> <b>ratio</b> of an intervention was the estimated costs of the intervention divided by the estimated public health benefits due to the intervention, and was expressed in euro per avoided disability-adjusted life year (DALY).

A deterministic simulation model was developed to estimate the <b>cost-effectiveness</b> <b>ratio</b> of each intervention, if it would be implemented on all broiler farms in a country where it isn't implemented yet and implementation is possible. The model considered differences between countries in number and size of broiler farms and established practices, in import, export and transit of live broilers, broiler meat and meat products, in effect of interventions on Campylobacter prevalence in broilers, in disease burden of Campylobacter related human illness, in national economic factors, such as interest rate and general cost levels, and in technical and economic farm performance. Across interventions, cost-effectiveness ratios were the lowest for Poland and Spain, and highest for Norway and Denmark. Across countries, applying designated tools for each farm house and building an anteroom with hygiene barrier in each farm house had the lowest cost-effectiveness ratios, whereas a ban on thinning (partial depopulation), slaughter at 35 days, replacing old houses by new houses, and applying drink nipples without cup had the highest.
