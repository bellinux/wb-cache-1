5|$|In 1982, {{shortly after}} The Texas <b>Chain</b> <b>Saw</b> Massacre {{established}} {{itself as a}} success on US home video, Wizard Video released a mass-market video game adaptation for the Atari 2600. In the game, the player assumes the role of Leatherface and attempts to murder trespassers while avoiding obstacles such as fences and cow skulls. As {{one of the first}} horror-themed video games, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre caused controversy when it was first released due to its violent nature; it sold poorly as a result, because many game stores refused to stock it.|$|E
5|$|The Texas <b>Chain</b> <b>Saw</b> Massacre {{was mainly}} shot using an Eclair NPR 16mm camera with fine-grain, {{low-speed}} film that required {{four times more}} light than modern digital cameras. Most of the filming {{took place in the}} farmhouse, which was filled with furniture constructed from animal bones and a latex material used as upholstery to give the appearance of human skin. The house was not cooled, and there was little ventilation. The crew covered its walls with drops of animal blood obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Art director Robert A. Burns drove around the countryside and collected the remains of cattle and other animals in various stages of decomposition, with which he littered the floors of the house.|$|E

40|$|Boatbuilding, {{shaping the}} body with {{chainsaws}} About 30 persons gathered in the forest where a large tree had been felled. Using chainsaws men were taking turns shaping the boat body {{out of the tree}} trunk. Meanwhile women were busy cooking for all participants. It takes long time to make a boat. The first step is felling the tree. Next the body is shaped, as recorded here. It takes several full day sessions before that is done. The next major event is pulling the canoe/boat body to the beach. There was no opportunity to record this stage of boat building. Depending on what kind of boat is made, further steps are taken to finish it on the beach (see separate recordings of men working on boat building in Ujir) The media files are concatenated from the following original files: (date; length of recording; short description of sequence) 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 1 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 19 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 2 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 20 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 3 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 4 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 16 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 5 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 16 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 6 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 16 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 7 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 8 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 08 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 9 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 28 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 10 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 26 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 11 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 21 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 12 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 31 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 13 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 45 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 14 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 13 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 15 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 04 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 16 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 25 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing,</b> guys watching 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 17 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 07 women and kids, serving food 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 18 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 women and kids, serving food 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 19 WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 09 women and kids, serving food 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 20 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 13 people, end of the big tree trunk 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 21 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 people, end of the big tree trunk 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 22 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 32 people, end of the big tree trunk 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 23 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 18 people, end of the big tree trunk 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 24 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 14 people, end of the big tree trunk, cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 25 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 26 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 20 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 27 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 16 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 28 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 18 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 29 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 15 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 30 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 25 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 31 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 13 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 32 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 17 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 33 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 34 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 10 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 35 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 13 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 36 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 16 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 37 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 14 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 38 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 13 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 39 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 23 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 40 _WellfeltE 00 : 01 : 00 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 41 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 27 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 42 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 59 chain sawin...|$|R

5|$|The {{concept for}} The Texas <b>Chain</b> <b>Saw</b> Massacre {{arose in the}} early 1970s while Tobe Hooper was working as an {{assistant}} film director at the University of Texas at Austin and as a documentary cameraman. He had already developed a story involving the elements of isolation, the woods, and darkness. He credited the graphic coverage of violence by San Antonio news outlets as one inspiration for the film and based elements of the plot on serial killer Ed Gein in 1950s Wisconsin; Gein inspired other horror films such as Psycho (1960) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991). During development, Hooper used the working titles of Headcheese and Leatherface.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of those}} killed were tortured, beaten using chains and burned. Most {{of the victims were}} killed by gunshots, but the cause of death proved hard to {{establish}} for eight victims whose bodies were severely burned. A couple was bound with chains and burned alive, two women were killed using axes or similar sharp objects, one of them by several axe blows to her head. Another couple was beheaded and their heads were placed in bags. One victim was cut by a <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> while still alive, and another died trapped in her house which was torched by the paramilitaries. The Serb civilian who attempted to protect the others was also beaten, tortured using lighted cigarettes and heated chains, and then flayed.|$|E
5|$|The Texas <b>Chain</b> <b>Saw</b> Massacre is a 1974 American horror film {{directed}} by Tobe Hooper and written and co-produced by Hooper and Kim Henkel. It stars Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow and Gunnar Hansen, who respectively portray Sally Hardesty, Franklin Hardesty, the hitchhiker, the proprietor, and Leatherface. The film follows {{a group of}} friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead. Although it was marketed as a true story to attract a wider audience and as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate, its plot is entirely fictional; however, the character of Leatherface and minor plot details were inspired by the crimes of real-life murderer Ed Gein.|$|E

5|$|Upon its October 1974 release, The Texas <b>Chain</b> <b>Saw</b> Massacre {{was banned}} {{outright}} in several countries, and numerous theaters later stopped showing {{the film in}} response to complaints about its violence. While it initially drew a mixed reception from critics, it was enormously profitable, grossing over $30 million at the domestic box office. It has since received a positive reappraisal and gained {{a reputation as one}} of the best and most influential horror films in cinema history. It is credited with originating several elements common in the slasher genre, including the use of power tools as murder weapons and the characterization of the killer as a large, hulking, faceless figure. The popularity of the film led to a franchise that continued the story of Leatherface and his family through sequels, remakes, one prequel, comic books and video games.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of a leopard with glowing blue eyes (later {{revealed}} to be Kesha) walking down an alleyway. The song's title flashes {{on the screen and}} the video pans to Kesha. She walks down the alleyway with two men who grab another man. Kesha spray-paints a dollar sign on his chest. They come to a party where she and her friends flash their tattooed dollar signs on their wrists and forearms in order to enter. As they enter, everyone starts dancing and the party-goers' faces are shown changing into different animals'. In the following scene, Kesha is seen sitting on a chair with two men by her side. Jeffree Star then approaches Kesha. Kesha and Star engage in a choreographed dance battle; Star then shoots Kesha with a laser <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> which she deflects with her bracelet, Kesha responds by shooting lasers out of her hands, killing Star. After the battle the party-goers crawl around Kesha and she is seen holding a gold cup with a blue foaming liquid spilling {{over the top of the}} glass. As Kesha gives the party goers a drink, their faces turn into different kinds of animals. The video ends with everyone dancing and turning into half animal humans, Kesha however, drinks from the cup and turns back into a leopard.|$|E

In favour of avoiding the convoluted continuity of the previous films whilst going in an unexpected direction, Seth M. Sherwood pitched Leatherface to Millennium Films as a prequel that would follow the titular character in a mentally competent state, enduring trauma that transforms him into the intellectually disabled murderer seen in the previous films. Maury and Bustillo signed on as directors after reading the screenplay, impressed with what they {{found to be a}} unique take on the long-running franchise.

25|$|The {{carving of}} a piece, which is done while the wood is still wet, can last {{anywhere}} from hours to a month, {{depending on the}} size and fineness of the piece. Often the copal wood that is used will influence what is made, both because of the shapes the branches can take and because male and female trees differ in hardness and shape. Carving is done with non-mechanical hand tools such as machetes, chisels and knives. The only time a more sophisticated tool is used is when a <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> is employed to cut off a branch or level a base for the proposed figure. The basic shape of the creature is usually hacked using a machete, then a series of smaller knives used as the final shape is achieved. Certain details such as ears, tails and wings are usually made from pieces separate from the one for the main body.|$|E
40|$|In Ghana, {{majority}} of the rural folk depend on <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> activities for livelihood. <b>Chain</b> <b>sawing</b> is, however, characterized by degradation of the forest and therefore the government has put {{a ban on the}} production of lumber through <b>chain</b> <b>sawing.</b> This action has really affected the livelihood of people living along the fringes of the forest since they depend mostly on <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> activities {{to take care of their}} families. The ban on <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> activities by the government has led to migration of some of the youth from the rural areas to the urban areas to search for jobs which do not exist. Some of the youth get frustrated because of the lack of jobs in the urban areas and resort to some form of social vices. The youth in the rural areas could be gainfully employed if they are assisted to convert into lumber, and in an efficient manner, the large volumes of logging residues that are left in the forest in the form of branches, buttresses and stumps. Another area that is worth mentioning and needs to be addressed urgently to help halt the degradation of the forest is the large volume of oil palm trunks that are left in the forest to rot after tapping the wine in the trees. Thus, enormous quantities of palm trees are discarded in vain, while destruction of the rain forest has been expanding in the same tropical areas by excess cutting of trees. People living along the fringes of the forest could also be gainfully employed if they are assisted to convert the oil palm trunks into lumber using appropriate processing technology. Skill development and training on the use of logging residues and discarded oil palm trunk as raw material for the downstream wood processing sector is a promising venture to promote Technical and Vocational Education and Training 1...|$|R

In 1944, the United States captured the Mariana Islands chain from Japan: the Northern Mariana Islands were desired by the U.S. as bombing bases to reach the Japanese mainland, with the invasion of Saipan being launched for that reason in June before the U.S. even moved to recapture Guam; a month later the U.S. recaptured Guam and captured Tinian. Once captured, the islands of Saipan and Tinian were used extensively by the United States military as they finally put mainland Japan within round-trip range of American B-29 bombers. In response, Japanese forces attacked the bases on Saipan and Tinian from November 1944 to January 1945. At the same time and afterwards, the United States Army Air Forces based out of these islands conducted an intense strategic bombing campaign against the Japanese cities of military and industrial importance, including Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe and others.
