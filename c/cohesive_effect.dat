40|$|Wet {{granulation}} and coating {{are critical}} steps {{in a number of}} industrial processes used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. In these processes, liquid is added to powder and mechanically mixed to uniformly disperse the liquid in the system. The liquids typically form capillary bridges in between particles which significantly changes the physical behavior and dynamic strength of these powders. It is crucial for final product formulations and design to determine the dynamic strength of these wet granular material as well as quantitatively understand the liquid dispersion rate. Currently, most processes involving the dispersion of liquids in particulate beds are designed by trial and error resulting in a significant loss of materials, not to mention time, potential profits, and product effectiveness. At present, there are few models predicting the mixing rate of these powder-liquid mixtures. The objective of this thesis was to develop and validate better predictive models for the dispersion of liquids in granular material. It is vital to understand the microscopic liquid transfer process in order to develop better macroscopic predictive models using the Discrete Element Method (DEM), typically used for analyzing particulate systems. For the microscopic model, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model and Volume of Fluid (VOF) method was utilized to numerically investigate the filling of a liquid bridge when two spherical particles with uniform films touch. A constitutive model for pendular bridge regime was developed to predict the liquid filling rate of a capillary bridge. ^ A macroscopic model was then developed using the open source DEM code, LIGGGHTS. The dynamics of wet granular material differ significantly from dry granular material due to the <b>cohesive</b> <b>effects</b> of the liquid bridges. The <b>cohesive</b> <b>effects</b> of the liquid bridges and liquid transfer was incorporated in the DEM code. The existing liquid transfer models was compared with a new model that spatially tracks the liquid drops on the particle surface. The liquid transfer models were also compared to a population balance model to show an exponential decaying mixing rate. The results show a high dependence of mixing rate on the liquid bridge participation models. Additionally, it was shown that the effects of orientation and roughness affect the liquid transfer rates. ^ Finally, a non-destructive method to experimentally study the liquid transfer rates using X-Ray computed tomography (XRCT) was developed. A shear cell setup was devised to fit inside the XRCT machine and the liquid was tracked using a MATLAB image processing algorithm. The experiment showed qualitatively the liquid transfer from shearing the particulate system. The experiment also showed that cohesion {{is an integral part of}} such systems and cannot be ignored in DEM simulations. ...|$|R

We describe a simple equation for quantifying the <b>cohesive</b> <b>effect</b> of HR on microbial populations as a function of their nucleotide divergence, μ/ρ = πg 10 − 20 πg. The model was verified using a forward-time microbial population simulator that can explore the evolutionary dynamics of sympatric populations in nonoverlapping niche space. The model was also evaluated using multilocus sequence data from a range of microbial species, providing criteria for dividing them into either cohesively recombining or clonally diverging lineages.

40|$|Granular packing {{structures}} of cohesive micro-sized particles with different sizes and size distributions, including mono-sized, uniform and Gaussian distribution, are investigated by using two different history dependent contact models with Discrete Element Method (DEM). The simulation {{is carried out}} in the framework of LIGGGHTS which is a DEM simulation package extended based on branch of granular package of widely used open-source code LAMMPS. Contact force caused by translation and rotation, frictional and damping forces due to collision with other particles or container boundaries, cohesive force, van der Waals force, and gravity are considered. The radial distribution functions (RDFs), force distributions, porosities, and coordination numbers under cohesive and non-cohesive conditions are reported. The results indicate that particle size and size distributions have great influences on the packing density for particle packing under cohesive effect: particles with Gaussian distribution have the lowest packing density, followed by the particles with uniform distribution; the particles with mono-sized distribution have the highest packing density. It is also found that <b>cohesive</b> <b>effect</b> to the system does not significantly affect the coordination number that mainly depends on the particle size and size distribution.

Especially it turned {{the question of}} internal initials that correspond to water rise. Parallel to laboritory tests and field experiments a micromechanical model should be developed, which can reproduce processes in the soil during saturation. In first approximation a partly saturated soil consists of two phases: the soil particles and the pore fluid. For micromechanical modeling a coupling of discontinuum particles) and continuum (fluid) is required. The soil particles can be simulated with the Discrete-Element-Method (DEM). For the pore fluid, which {{is assumed to be}} a mixture of liquid and gaseous fractions, Pore scale model with Finite Volumes (PFV) is used. At low water content liquid bridges (meniscii) arise between the particles that cause an apparent cohesion. The effect of the meniscii is considered by a correspondingly contact law in the DEM model. During the saturation of a soil both, <b>cohesive</b> <b>effect</b> and fluid bulk modulus, are reduced. In addition buoyancy acts on the particles during the process. The micromechanical modeling approach has the advantage, that just a few model parameters are needed. The numerical model shows pore fluid pressures during saturation process, that leads to a reduction of effective stress. It is investigated how much the reduction is regarding porosity, degree of saturation, stress conditions and grain shape. Furthermore the influence of model parameters as well as hydromechanics is investigated.

40|$|Knowledge of spatio-temporal {{dynamics}} of soil water content, groundwater and infiltration processes is of considerable {{importance for the}} understanding and prediction of landslides. Rainfall and consequent water infiltration affect slope stability in various ways, mainly acting on the pore pressure distribution whose increase causes a decrease of the shearing resistance of the soil. For such reasons rainfall and transient changes in the hydrological systems are considered the most common triggers of landslides. So far, the difficulty to monitor groundwater levels or soil moisture contents in unstable terrain have made modeling of landslide a complex issue. At the present, the availability of sophisticated hydrological and physically based models, able to simulate the main hydrological processes, has allowed the development of coupled hydrologicalstability models able to predict when and where a failure could occur. In this study, a slope-failure module, with capability to predict shallow landslides, implemented into an ecohydrological model, tRIBS-VEGGIE (Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) -based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator with VEGetation Generator for Interactive Evolution), is presented. The model evaluates the stability dynamics in term of factor of safety consequent to the soil moisture dynamics, strictly depending on the textural soil characteristics and hillslope geometry. Failure criterion used to derive factor of safety equation accounts for the stabilizing effect of matric suction arising in unsaturated soils.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{conversational}} {{ability of a}} conversing computer program (referred to {{in the community of}} artificial intelligence as a ‘chatbot ’ or ‘bot’). The analysis considers the use of lexical cohesion as a means of creating continuity in a dialogue between the computational system, the bot, and its human conversational partners. Lexical cohesion is a cohesive device which creates unity in a text through the selection of vocabulary. Lexical items are connected to one another to create cohesive ‘ties ’ which hold the sentences together and make them appear as being about ‘the same thing’. This device was chosen for the current analysis as it is related to both lexical and world knowledge that are challenging areas as far as a machine is considered. The system analyzed is a chatbot named ‘Alan ’ which appears on an open Internet site and converses with users who seek information or wish to chat with a computer program. The analysis examined 9 conversations (average of 92. 4 turns) between the bot and random human users. For each conversation the frequencies of 5 different categories of lexical cohesion ties were calculated. Additionally, cohesive ties were further evaluated in terms of their success to connect the bot’s production to what was previously said by the human user. It was hypothesized that ties that demand more lexical or general knowledge would prove to be less frequent in the bot’s productions and more sensitive to conversational breakdowns. The system was found to create a variety of lexical cohesion ties and of different levels of lexical complexity. Frequencies of lexical cohesion categories were partly related to the level of lexical complexity of the tie. The majority of cohesive ties were shown to be successful in connecting the bot’s productions to the human user’s productions. However, some cohesive ties were found to function in a way that ‘cancelled ’ the <b>cohesive</b> <b>effect</b> and broke the flow of the conversation.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 107 - 112) An ancient people, Armenians {{have lived}} in the general area that is now eastern Turkey and northern Iraq for nearly three thousand years. With their acceptance of Christianity in the fourth century, and more importantly their subsequent religious isolation from other Christian sects, Armenians developed a separate and unique culture. Due to the Turkish policy of genocide against Armenians in the later part of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Armenians bade farewell to their homeland in large numbers. American missionaries had gone to Turkey in 1831, and from these evangelists Armenians had learned of America. It was to escape the despotism of the Ottomans, attendant with the knowledge of a better life in America, that Armenians migrated to America. In America two large Armenian colonies developed, the largest one in New England around Boston, and the other colony in the San Joaquin Valley centered on Fresno, California. Armenian settlement in Fresno began in 1881, and by 1920 there were nearly five thousand Armenians living there. Armenians immediately clustered together in an enclave which was located in the blighted residential areas of the c 1 ty. The institution of the family {{and the role of the}} Armenian Churches were two salient forces accounting for their clustered pattern of settlement. The <b>cohesive</b> <b>effect</b> of these two institutions were reinforced appreciably by the prejudice and general suspicion against the Armenians almost immediately encountered upon their arrival to the area. The prejudice against the ethnip group had a spatial character to it, in the numerous restrictive covenants which legally prevented Armenians from living in many localities in Fresno. Hence, the family, the church, and the prejudice against Armenians all helped to shape early Armenian settlement patterns in Fresno. Second-generation Armenians were faced with the transition from an old culture to a new culture, and to many of them Old World values held little value in the American environment. The dispersal of Armenians away from the enclave in the 1940 1 s was, in part, by the second generation. This trend away from the ethnic enclave became significant during the 1950 's, in part due to the outlawing of the restrictive racial covenant as a legal tool for segregation in America. This suburbanization of Armenians in Fresno continued unabated, and by 1960 over one-half of the ethnic group no longer resided in a compact enclave, and many were scattered among the city's general population. Because of the desire to find better housing and an equal, if not stronger desire to escape the progressive encroachment of blacks and Mexicans in Fresno, it is postulated that the trend towards suburbanization among Armenians should continue in the future...|$|E
40|$|Visual and phonotactic {{orientation}} {{often occur}} simultaneously in diurnal cicadas. and these animals generally have their largest sensory elaboration in eyes and hearing organs. Phonotactic orientation occurs principally during flight. Males and females of Magicicada cassini commonly perform low- altitude « 5 m) and short-distance « 15 m) flights {{in their natural}} habitat at flight speeds of 3 to 6 m/s. During flight, the long body axis is tilted 10 ° to Q, head upward. Wing beat frequencies of tethered animals at 24 ° to 26 °C averaged 28. 8 Hz. Body temperature {{in the field for}} flying individuals aver- aged 4. 6 °C above ambient. Compound eyes of females possess about 7 % more facets than males, and the binocular field of view for both is especially expanded dorsa-frontally, frontally, and fronto-ventrally. The role of vision for phonoresponses, and in flight and landing behavior. was studied in nature by comparing controls with cicadas with eyes partly to completely covered with aluminum paint. Cicadas with their three ocelli covered behaved like controls and exhibited low-altitude and short-distance flights with landings on neighboring shrubs, as did cicadas with only both caudal halves or both dorsal halves of the compound eyes covered. Those with both compound eyes covered completely (with or without additionally covering the three ocelli) flew to higher altitudes and for longer distances. Higher and longer flight courses were also seen in cicadas (A) with only one compound eye covered. which in addition circled during walking and flight toward the side of unrestricted vision, (B) with both frontal or both ventral halves of their compound eyes covered. and (C) with either the binocular or monocular fields of the eyes covered. Thus, the paired fronta-antero-ventral regions of the compound eyes provide visual information for habitat-dependent low-altitude flights and landings. Females with intact compound eyes and ocelli responded to playbacks of just the frequency/intensity sweep {{at the end of the}} buzz in calling songs of a male by flying within 1. 2 m above the ground and landing on a nylon screen- covered small bush directly above the loudspeaker from distances of 2 to 8 m. mostly from lower vegetation. Males that were blinded, or blinded and deafened, sang less and flew less than normal males. However. they performed all of those behaviors, and all also walked and fed. Periodical cicadas (Magicicada, Tibicininae) are known for synchronized adult emergence and noisy aggregations of millions of individuals of three intermingled species in each brood population (Alexander and Moore 1962). Broods are isolated geographically and chronologically, such that in some years no periodical cicada adults emerge, and most areas of the eastern United States have only one brood population appearing as adults at intervals of either 13 or 17 years. In all Magicicada species, daily flights affect spacing and aggregation of both sexes during feeding, chorusing, mating, and ovipositing. Flights are mediated by both acoustical and visual cues. Each species in these aggregations establishes mating leks. These aggregations continue to mix, every day and unpredictably, during the emergence period. Toward the end of the reproductive season, males die sooner than females, leading to little or no chorusing, and then females disperse progressively further from the lek sites. The <b>cohesive</b> <b>effect</b> of the acoustical cues of chorusing males on these cicada populations is obvious. Both sexes of all six species of periodical cicadas live and feed on shrubs and trees of different species, sizes, and shapes, and females lay eggs in their living twigs. Their niches overlap almost completely, the three species of 13 ­ year or 17 -year cicadas being separated principally by diurnal acoustic behavior leading to aggregation sites that change every day and are seldom exclusive to a single Magicicada species. Adults frequently change location in these complex visual environments by short-distance and low-altitude flights. which we call bush-hopping. These flights are associated with sound communication and reproductive activities and are most commonly observed during bright sunlight and at ambient temperatures above 25 °C with little wind (Alexander and Moore 1958, 1962; Dunning et al. 1979). Otte (1990) and Toms (1992) discuss the common correlation between hearing and flying in orthop­teroid insects, interactions basically similar to those found in cicadas. The present paper describes the interaction of vision (compound eyes and ocelli) and phonoresponses of males and females of Magicicada cassini (Fisher) in walking, but especially in flight and landing behavior, within a natural habitat...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The X-ray {{spectral}} {{energy distribution}} of isolated neutron stars shows no evi-dence of atmospheric spectral features due to atomic transitions. This unexpected lack of spectral lines, {{together with the}} systematic optical excess (with respect to the X-ray best fit extrapolation) observed in several objects, {{is one of the}} current paradigms in the theoreti-cal understanding of neutron stars. We investigate the thermal emission from neutron star surfaces in which the <b>cohesive</b> <b>effects</b> of a strong magnetic field have produced the con-densation of the atmosphere and the external layers. This may happen for sufficiently cool (T ≤ 106) atmospheres with moderately intense magnetic fields (about 1013 G for Fe at-mospheres). The thermal emission from such a bare surface shows no remarkable spectral features. In addition, since the thermal conductivity is very different in the perpendicular and parallel directions to the magnetic field lines, the presence of the magnetic field is ex-pected to produce a highly anisotropic temperature distribution at the surface of the star, depending on the magnetic field geometry. The observed flux from this objects looks very similar to a blackbody spectrum, but depressed by a nearly constant factor at all energies. More interestingly, if one takes into account the effect of the motion of ions in a crude ap-proximation, combined with the anisotropic thermal distribution, it results in an apparent optical excess. Both facts seem to indicate that some isolated neutron stars are old, cold magnetars...|$|R
40|$|When {{traditional}} linearised {{theory is}} used to study free-surface flows past a surface-piercing object or over an obstruction in a stream, the geometry of the object is usually lost, having been assumed small in one or several of its dimensions. In order to preserve the nonlinear nature of the geometry, asymptotic expansions in the low-Froude or low-Bond limits can be derived, but here, the solution invariably predicts a waveless free-surface at every order. This is because the waves are in fact, exponentially small, and thus beyond-all-orders of regular asymptotics; their formation {{is a consequence of}} the divergence of the asymptotic series and the associated Stokes Phenomenon. In this thesis, we will apply exponential asymptotics to the study of two new problems involving nonlinear geometries. In the first, we examine the case of free-surface flow over a step including the effects of both gravity and surface tension. Here, we shall see that the availability of multiple singularities in the geometry, coupled with the interplay of gravitational and <b>cohesive</b> <b>effects,</b> leads to the discovery of a remarkable new set of solutions. In the second problem, we study the waves produced by bluff-bodied ships in low-Froude flows. We will derive the analytical form of the exponentially small waves {{for a wide range of}} hull geometries, including single-cornered and multi-cornered ships, and then provide comparisons with numerical computations. A particularly significant result is our confirmation of the thirty-year old conjecture by Vanden-Broeck & Tuck (1977) regarding the impossibility of waveless single-cornered ships. </p...|$|R
40|$|The fluidal {{behavior}} of pyroclastic flows is commonly attributed to high gas pore pressures and associated fluidization effects. We carried out experiments on flows of fluidized volcanic ash at 170 degrees C, which is {{hot enough to}} reduce <b>cohesive</b> <b>effects</b> of moisture. The flows were generated in a 3 - m- long, horizontal lock- exchange flume. The ash was fluidized and expanded uniformly in the flume reservoir by up to 43 % above loose packing and was then released. Each flow defluidized progressively down the flume until motion ceased. Initial expansion E and initial height h(0) were varied independently of one another. The flows traveled in a laminar manner. Flow fronts exhibited three main phases of transport: (1) a brief initial phase of gravitational slumping, (2) a dominant, approximately constant velocity phase, and (3) a brief stopping phase. Phase 2 frontal velocities scaled with root gh(0), like other types of dam- break flow. Deposition from initially expanded flows took place by progressive sediment aggradation {{at a rate that}} was independent of distance and varied only with E. Despite rates of shear up to 80 s(- 1), aggradation rates were identical to those determined independently, at the same value of E, in quasi-static collapse tests. Sedimentation caused the flows to thin progressively during transit until they ran out of volume. The dynamics were governed to a first order by two dimensionless parameters: (1) the initial aspect ratio h(0) /x(0) in the lock reservoir and (2) the ratio t(sett) /t(grav) of two timescales: a particle settling time t(sett) and a gravitational acceleration time t(grav) ...|$|R
40|$|This study uses data on {{campaign}} contributions {{and methods of}} network analysis to investigate the significance of interlocking di-rectorates for political cohesion among corporate elites. Using qua-dratic assignment procedure (QAP) regression, the author shows that social ties formed through common membership on corporate boards contribute more to similarity of political behavior than common-alities of economic interests, such as those associated with operating in the same industry or the same geographic region. Moreover, the politically <b>cohesive</b> <b>effects</b> of directorship ties remain robust even as one moves several links down the chain of indirect ties that connect top corporate officers to one another. The study thus pro-vides empirical support for the thesis that social networks among corporate elites facilitate political cohesion within the business community. Interlocking directorates among major U. S. corporations have been a focus of political and scholarly interest since the early 20 th century. In recent decades, advances in computer technology and methods of network analysis {{have led to a}} virtual explosion of empirical studies of interlocking corporate directorates. Despite this extensive body of research, important questions remain as to the meaning and significance of director interlocks. As Mizruchi (1996) notes in his review of the literature, the question What do interlocks do? is perhaps the most crucial question confronting inter-locks research. Critics of the early studies of director interlocks argued that this research was mostly descriptive and that the social, political, and economic effects of interlocking directorates were more often assumed than empirically demonstrated. Partly in response to this criticism, con...|$|R
