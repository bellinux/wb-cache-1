25|$|E. actinophylla is cheiropterophilous (bat-pollinated). E. longiflora has the long, narrow <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> that {{is typical}} of hawkmoth-pollinated flowers.|$|E
25|$|Stamens 5, {{inserted}} on the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube,</b> filaments short, anthers basifixed. Ovary inferior, bi-locular, sometimes 4-locular {{in the upper}} part, style exserted and a spindle-shaped stigma.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the genus}} are small {{perennial}} or annual herbs that reside in oases of deep white sand surrounded by the typical vegetation of the cerrado ecoregion. They {{are no more than}} 26cm tall with 5-10 leaves. Zigzag-shaped racemes are produced from upright stems and account for the height of the species. These monotelic inflorescences are leafless and produce pale blue to lilac flowers (P. goiasensis has a yellow <b>corolla</b> <b>tube).</b> The flowers possess monothecous, glabrous anthers, which are unusual in the family. The upper surface of the leaves are covered with stalked capitate glands that are also seen in many carnivorous plant genera.|$|E
5000|$|X. virginica have unique maxillae {{that are}} {{designed}} to perform perforations on <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes</b> to reach nectaries. Their maxillae are [...] "sharp and wedge-shaped", allowing them to split the side of <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes</b> externally to access the nectar. The Eastern carpenter bees also have galae on their maxillae that are shaped like large, flat blades. Research has shown that individuals with sharp galae can use these to further aid in penetrating the <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{role of the}} corolla {{in plant}} {{evolution}} has been studied extensively since Charles Darwin postulated a theory {{of the origin of}} elongated <b>corollae</b> and <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many bee flies, {{and some}} Tabanidae and Nemestrinidae are {{particularly}} adapted to pollinating fynbos and Karoo plants with narrow, deep <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes,</b> such as Lapeirousia species. Part of the adaptation {{takes the form}} of remarkably long probosces.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Corolla</b> <b>tube</b> {{unlike that}} of most of Bignoniaceae {{in that it is}} not {{differentiated}} into two unlike parts, one above and one below the level of stamen [...] insertion.|$|E
2500|$|The basally curved {{fruit of}} Ekmanianthe is a [...] {{distinguishing}} feature, clearly [...] separating that genus from Tabebuia. The {{edge of the}} corolla is laciniate in a few moth-pollinated and a few bat-pollinated species of Tabebuia, but much less so than in Ekmanianthe. The lenticels of E. longiflora and the [...] costae (ribs) on the fruit of E. actinophylla are more prominent than those of any species of Tabebuia. The <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> of E. longiflora is longer than that of any species of Tabebuia. E. actinophylla has 5 fertile stamens, a [...] trait not seen in Tabebuia.|$|E
2500|$|V. rotundifolia is a {{sprawling}} shrub that can grow {{as tall as}} 1.5 m though it typically ranges from 0.5 to 1 m in height. As a product of its rapid nodal rooting, the plant can form dense mats reaching in excess of 10 m from the parent plant. New stems are green, square and fleshy initially before maturing brown and woody. Older, large-diameter stems are covered with heavily fissured bark. Running horizontal stems produce frequent upright branches. Leaves are strongly aromatic, intensifying when crushed. The majority of leaves are simple, but they can occasionally be palmate trifoliate or 2-leaved. Leaves measure 2 to 6.5cm in length and 1-4.5cm in width. Leaf margins are entire. The leaf shape varies from ovate to obovate with acute bases and obtuse apexes. Occasionally, leaf apexes are acute or emarginate. Upper leaf surfaces are dark green whereas lower leaf surfaces range in color from silver to white to light green; all leaf surfaces are tomentose. Petiole bases are typically somewhat purple and measure 0 to 1cm in length. Blades are cupped downward slightly. Leaf veins are lighter green than surrounding tissue. Flowers are borne in indeterminate panicles that may be terminal or axillary. Infloresences measure 3 to 7cm in length. The calyx is cup-shaped and 4 to 4.5cm long. Flowers are zygomorphic, purple to blue-purple, and short pedunculate. They are two-lipped and funnel-form (measuring 8mm in length). Four stamens are didynamous and extend beyond the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> (measuring 9 to 10mm). The style extends beyond the stamens (total length: 12mm). Pollen is tricolpate. Ovaries consist of two carpels with each containing two single seeded locules. Fruits are globose drupes that are green while immature but turn yellow and red before maturing to bluish black. The fruits are frequently incorrectly characterized in the literature as [...] "seeds or berries". Each drupe contains a maximum of four seeds though there are usually fewer {{as a result of}} seed abortion. Each seed is encapsulated in a separate compartment. Endosperm is absent. Seeds germinate into tender seedlings that bear two cotyledons and quickly develop two red-margined true leaves. Ploidy level is 2n = 32, 34*.|$|E
2500|$|Most adults feed on nectar, {{although}} a few tropical species feed on eye secretions, and the death's-head hawkmoth steals honey from bees. Night-flying sphingids tend to prefer pale flowers with long <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes</b> and a sweet odour, a pollination syndrome known as 'sphingophily'. Some species are quite general in visitations, while others are very specific, with the plant only being successfully pollinated by a particular species of moth. Orchids frequently have such specific relations with hawk moths, and very long <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes.</b> The comet orchid, Angraecum sesquipedale, a rare Malagasy flower with its nectar stored {{at the bottom of}} a 30-cm-long tube, was described in 1822 by Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars, and later, Charles Darwin famously predicted there must be some specialised animal to feed from it: ...|$|R
50|$|Adult horse-flies feed on nectar {{and plant}} exudates, {{and some are}} {{important}} pollinators of certain specialised flowers; several South African and Asian species in the Pangoniinae have spectacularly long proboscises adapted for the extraction of nectar from flowers with long, narrow <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes,</b> such as Lapeirousia, and certain Pelargonium.|$|R
50|$|The vlei ink-flower has {{white or}} rosy-tinged (sometimes purple) flowers that {{open in the}} evening, and have long narrow <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes.</b> These traits all occur in flowers that are pollinated by hawkmoths, {{although}} a clear scent was not observed. Hippotion celerio and Nephele comma have been seen to visit C. tubulosum.|$|R
5000|$|The stamens of Pachypodium brevicaule, with an apex of 4 to 9 mm {{below the}} mouth of the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube,</b> are inserted, meaning they do not extend beyond the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> or mouth of the flower. They measure from the base 3.5 to 4 mm. (Proportionally they are 0.22-0.29 of the length of the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube.)</b> The stamens are the [...] "male reproductive" [...] organ of an angiospermous {{flowering}} plant.|$|E
50|$|There are two varieties: Salvia omeiana var. omeiana has an ovate shaped bract, and no hairs {{inside the}} <b>corolla</b> <b>tube.</b> Salvia omeiana var. grandibracteata {{has a more}} {{lanceolate}} bract, and is slightly hairy inside the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
50|$|Exostema is a genus of neotropical {{trees and}} shrubs. The flowers have a slender <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> with {{recurved}} corolla lobes. The stamens are inserted {{near the base}} of the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> and exserted well beyond its mouth. The anthers are long and basifixed.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} and illustrate {{a new species}} of Calibrachoa (Solanaceae) {{from the state of}} Santa Catarina in southern Brazil. Calibrachoa eglandulata is distinguished by the presence of eglandular trichomes, relatively long stamens and <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes,</b> lobed stigmas, and pendent branches. The eglandular trichomes are unique to this species. We also propose nine new combinations in Calibrachoa...|$|R
50|$|The species resembles R. tibetica, but {{the leaf}} blades are smaller, the <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes</b> much longer, {{exceeding}} the calyx, and the labellum is differently shaped and has white {{lines at the}} base. It was found on hills at elevations of 2,200 to 3,000 m, in open grassy areas, where plants such as Lilium mackliniae were also present.|$|R
50|$|Robynsia is a {{monotypic}} genus {{of flowering}} {{plants in the}} Rubiaceae family. It was described by John Hutchinson and was named after his friend and colleague Walter Robyns. The genus contains only one species, Robynsia glabrata, which is found in Ghana, Ivory Coast and Nigeria. The species is morphologically similar to the genus Cuviera but differs by having long, slender <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There are 12 {{species in}} the genus, 4 having been added recently. The most {{distinctive}} features of the genus are the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> which is conical in the upper half, the tiny corolla lobes and very long anthers which are fully enclosed within the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube.</b> These 3 features {{are thought to be}} adaptations to buzz pollination. [...] The genus is most closely related to Brachyloma and Stenanthera but those genera have saccate corolla tubes, much large corolla lobes and shorter anthers which extend partially beyond the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
50|$|The flowers produce nectar at {{the base}} of the long, narrow <b>corolla</b> <b>tube,</b> and pollen near the end of the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube.</b> Only butterflies, moths, skippers, and long-tongued bees have long enough tongues to drink the nectar. Short-tongued bees and flower flies are unable to reach the nectar, but may gather or feed on pollen.|$|E
50|$|E. actinophylla is cheiropterophilous (bat-pollinated). E. longiflora has the long, narrow <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> that {{is typical}} of hawkmoth-pollinated flowers.|$|E
50|$|The {{last two}} methods of {{protection}} are physical barriers and indirect defence like symbionts. Tightly packed flowers and unfavourably sized <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes,</b> bract liquid moats and toughness of the corolla or sepal are barriers for some nectar robbers. A {{good example of}} an indirect defence is to attract symbiotic predators (like ants) by nectar or other rewards to scare away the robbers.|$|R
50|$|The Grass Demon is a nectar {{lover and}} has a long {{proboscis}} compared to body size. This {{makes it easy to}} get to nectar of flowers with long <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes.</b> In gardens, the Common Periwinkle (Vinca rosea) and Lantana are its favourite flowers. It rarely visits bird or dung droppings. It is fond of water and often seen perched on a stone in a stream-bed.|$|R
50|$|Various midges and thrips are {{comparatively}} minor opportunist pollinators. Ants also pollinate {{some kinds}} of flowers, {{but for the most}} part they are parasites, robbing nectar without conveying useful amounts of pollen to a stigma. Whole groups of plants, such as certain fynbos Moraea and Erica species produce flowers on sticky peduncles or with sticky <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes</b> that only permit access to flying pollinators, whether bird, bat, or insect.|$|R
5000|$|The corolla, {{the inner}} whorl of the perianth, is bright yellow. It {{measures}} 17 to 25 mm {{long in the}} mature bud and forms a comparatively wide broadly ovoid, shaped like an egg, ovate, head measuring 7 to 11 mm long by 5 to 8 mm wide. The apex of the bud is obtuse, having a blunt or rounded tip. Overall the bud is pubescent outside. The corolla lobes are not as hairy; however. Especially where the lobes and tubes are covered in bud, the surface is glabrous. The pubescent belt inside the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> is 2 mm above to 1 mm below where the stamens are inserted, not emerging beyond the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube.</b> Otherwise the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> is glabrous and smooth. It is shaped like a funnel, infundibuliform, at 12 to 18 mm long (1.63 times {{as large as the}} calyx and 1.05 to 1.36 times as long as the lopes) The basal of the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> is almost cylindrical. It is 2 to 3 mm long by 2 to 2.5 mm wide above the base (0.15 to 0.18 times {{the entire length of the}} entire tube.) The upper part of the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> is almost cylindrical. Yet it widens at the throat altering the cylindrical form. The upper part measures 10 to 15 mm long by 5 to 5.7 mm wide at the mouth. The lobes are obliquely obovate, having sides of unequal length or form, which are egg-shaped and flat with the narrow end attached to the stalk. At their apex, the lobe of Pachypodium brevicaule Baker are rounded. They measure 9 to 18 mm in length by 8.5 to 14 mm in width. (That is, in proportion, the lobes are 0.73 to 0.94 times as long as the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> and 1.1 to 1.3 times as long as they are wide.) ...|$|E
50|$|It {{appears that}} the long, narrow <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> evolved only once in Clerodendrum, and {{appeared}} again, among its relatives, in Ovieda.|$|E
50|$|Flowers have a tetradynamous androecium, {{with four}} long and two short stamens. Each flowers contain a {{variable}} number of ovules, ranging between 15 and 30 approx. Flowers have a non-fused <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> {{formed by the}} union of the petals and sepals. Flowers produce minute amount of nectar in four nectaries located {{in the base of}} the <b>corolla</b> <b>tube,</b> around the ovary. Corolla shape is extremely variable, ranging from radially to bilaterally symmetric even in the same population.|$|E
50|$|Buddleja × wardii is a shrub 1-5 m tall, with stellate {{tomentose}} glabrescent branchlets bearing leaves arranged both opposite and alternate, {{the blade}} elliptic to subelliptic, 0.5-5.0 × 0.3-2.0 cm, shortly stellate tomentose, margin repand-crenate, the apex acuminate to acute. The terminal inflorescences are cymose, 1.5-2.0 cm in diameter, comprising pale lilac or white flowers with orange throats; the <b>corolla</b> <b>tubes</b> about 7 × 2 mm.

5000|$|Phacelia covillei has slender weak stems {{which are}} 15 through 30 centimeters (6-12 inches) long, pubescent, and {{branched}} from their bases. Its leaves have 3 through 7 deeply divided lobes. It produces small, light blue-violet flowers in early spring. The flowers are on pedicels 13-17 millimeters (0.52-0.68 inches) long, in racemes of 1-6 flowers. <b>Corolla</b> <b>tubes</b> are about 6 millimeters long.

50|$|Forms with a {{straight}} <b>corolla</b> <b>tube</b> that were previously included within the species were reclassified by Craven in 2002 as R. viriosum. Presently this segregate species is not recognised and its name has been resumed as a synonym of this R. lochiae. Furthermore, those specimens with a curved <b>corolla</b> <b>tube,</b> at one stage known as R. notiale Craven, remain within the present definition of R. lochiae. Therefore, all Australian plants occurring in the wild are, presently, officially known as R. lochiae.|$|E
