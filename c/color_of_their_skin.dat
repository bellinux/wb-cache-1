40|$|International audienceAs he or {{she turns}} {{the pages of the}} works by African American writer William Melvin Kelley, the reader is struck by the {{evolutions}} his characters (black or white) undergo throughout the narratives. These evolutions are not those of characters that are not aware <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> <b>colors</b> in a context that is defined to make them realize it; but that of people who grow to understand the consequences the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> have for themselves and for those around them. As a matter of fact, Kelley’s writings are inscribed in the 1960 s, period of social and political changes in the lives of African Americans. These transformations are naturally transcribed within the author’s opuses. He thus tries to persuade his characters to go from a life of submission to a life fully lived, i. e. without pretense or assimilation. For this is the fact Kelley endeavors to pass on to his reader, the final person he wants to convince into a life without boundary due to the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skins.</b> Indeed, one must keep in mind that Kelley writes as an author of the Black Arts Movement, and that consequently his purpose is to primarily address Black people. In so specific a context his mission is a prominent one: he has to make blackness meaningful again; not for a white audience, but for the black one that has to be confident again as for their own worth. In that sense, Kelley transposes the lives of his fellow African Americans within his works; which, hence, makes them pregnant with a multitude of black identities...|$|R

When Ford learned that the school had capitulated to Georgia Tech, some accounts indicate that he [...] "quit the team" [...] or threatened to quit in order [...] "to make a statement and take a stand because Willis Ward was his friend."

You owe it to the team.’ [...] I decided he was right. That Saturday afternoon, we hit like never before and beat Georgia Tech 9–2.” [...] Years later, Ford wrote that the Ward incident had influenced his thinking about race. Ford noted: “His sacrifice led me to question how educational administrators could capitulate to raw prejudice.” [...] Ford used the story to voice his support for U-M’s affirmative action admissions policy saying, “Do we really want to risk turning back the clock to an era when the Willis Wards were isolated and penalized for the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin,</b> their economic standing or national ancestry?” ...|$|E

5000|$|Pachydactylus rangei {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 13 cm {{including}} a 6 cm tail. The head is quite distinct from the slender body and both are flattened dorsally. The eyes are large, dark-coloured and protuberant and have vertical pupils.The Web-footed gecko is very pale, nearly translucent. It has a salmon-colored undertone and some have light brown stripes or patterns. The <b>coloring</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> allows for very good camouflage among the sand of the Namib Desert. The skin is covered in fine, smooth scales and is translucent, {{and some of the}} internal organs can be seen through it. The legs are thin but the feet are broad, with fully webbed toes, enabling this gecko to burrow easily and to run on loose sand. The gecko developed the webbed feet as an adaptation to help them stay on top of the Namib Desert sand or bury underneath the sand. [...] They have developed this adaptation due to being nocturnal and needing to spend the days in self dug burrows and then spend the night on top of the sand feeding. Their feet also have adhesive pads on the bottom to help them climb. [...] The tail is thicker in males. The females can weigh around 10 grams and the males about 6 grams. The head and dorsal surface are pinkish-brown with darker markings, particularly in two intermittent lateral lines, and the ventral surface is off-white. There is often a bluish band between the eyes. This species is rather similar in appearance to Ptenopus garrulus, another species of gecko found within its range.|$|R
40|$|America’s public {{universities}} {{engage students in}} myriad classroom environments that range from traditional, entirely-in-person classroom environments to entirely-online, virtual classrooms, with every shade of grey in between.

Bollinger, the United States Supreme Court held that “student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions. ” Indeed, student body diversity remains one of the few “compelling interests” that the Court has held satisfies the constitutional imperative that the “government may treat people differently because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> race only for the most compelling reasons. ” Yet, can student body diversity exist when there are no student bodies, as in an online classroom?

50|$|Chromatophores are color pigment {{changing}} {{cells that}} are directly stimulated by central motor neurons. They are primarily used for quick environmental adaptation for camouflaging. The process <b>of</b> changing the <b>color</b> pigment <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> relies on a single highly developed chromatophore cell and many muscles, nerves, glail and sheath cells. Chromatophores contract and contain vesicles that stores three different liquid pigments. Each color is indicated by {{the three types of}} chromatophore cells: erythrophores, melanophores, and xanthophores. The first type is the erythrophores, which contains reddish pigments such as carotenoids and pteridines. The second type is the melanophores, which contains black and brown pigments such as the melanins. The third type is the xanthophores which contains yellow pigments in the forms of carotenoids. The various colors are made by the combination of the different layers of the chromatophores. These cells are usually located beneath the skin or scale the animals. There are two categories <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> generated by the cell - biochrome and schematochromes. Biochromes are colors chemically formed microscopic, natural pigments. Their chemical composition is created to take in some <b>color</b> <b>of</b> light and reflect the rest. In contrast, schematochromes (structural colors) are colors created by light reflections from a colorless surface and refractions by tissues. Schematochromes act like prisms, refracting and dispersing visible light to the surroundings, which will eventually reflect a specific combination <b>of</b> <b>colors.</b> These categories are determined by the movement of pigments within the chromatophores. The physiological color changes are short-term and fast, found in fishes, and are a result from an animal’s response to a change in the environment. In contrast, the morphological color changes are long-term changes, occurs in different stages of the animal, and are due the change of numbers of chromatophores. To change the color pigments, transparency, or opacity, the cells alter in form and size, and stretch or contract their outer covering.|$|R
