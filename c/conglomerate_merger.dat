Conglomerate mergers can serve various purposes, including extending corporate territories and extending a product range. One example of a <b>conglomerate</b> <b>merger</b> was the merger between the Walt Disney Company and the American Broadcasting Company.|$|E
50|$|Because a <b>conglomerate</b> <b>merger</b> is {{one between}} two {{strategically}} unrelated firms, {{it is unlikely}} that the economic benefits will be generated for the target or the bidder. As such, conglomerate mergers seldom occur today. However, conglomerate mergers were popular in the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s. Many conglomerate mergers are divested shortly after they are completed.|$|E
40|$|To condemn a <b>conglomerate</b> <b>merger</b> for the {{foreclosure}} effect of post-merger activities, one {{should examine the}} anticipated conduct against the same liability rules under the law of agreement and the law of abuse of dominance as if the conduct has been materialized.

50|$|There are {{two basic}} forms of non-horizontal mergers: {{vertical}} <b>mergers</b> and <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Conglomerate</b> <b>mergers</b> involve {{firms that}} operate in {{different}} product markets, without a vertical relationship. They may be product extension mergers, i.e., mergers between firms that produce different but related products or pure <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers,</b> i.e., mergers between firms operating in entirely different markets. In practice, {{the focus is}} on mergers between companies that are active in related or neighbouring markets, e.g., mergers involving suppliers of complementary products or of products belonging to a range of products that is generally sold to the same set of customers in a manner that lessens competition.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are the following: (i) To provide a review of the economic literature on vertical and <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers.</b> (ii) To provide a synthesis of this literature that {{can be used as a}} foundation for determining appropriate antitrust enforcement policy towards vertical and <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers.</b> 2. Definitions A horizontal merger occurs when the products of the merging firms are in the same antitrust market, i. e., are significant competitive constraints upon each other pre-merger. Non-horizontal mergers occur when the products of the parties to the transaction are in separate antitrust markets. A useful taxonomy for non-horizontal mergers is to distinguish between vertical and <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers.</b> In a vertical merger, pre-transaction, the firms are located at different stages of production or distribution, with one producing an input used by the other. Post-merger, the result is vertical integration and a single firm now performs both stages of production. <b>Conglomerate</b> <b>mergers</b> are neither horizontal or vertical. It is useful to adopt a three-way classification for <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers</b> based on the relationship of the products involved. These are mergers between complementary products, neighboring products, and unrelated products. In a merger involving complementary products, customers “assemble ” complements into systems that are ultimately consumed. A second type of transaction involving related products occurs when the products of the firms are not complements, but are in “neighboring ” markets.

40|$|A <b>conglomerate</b> <b>merger</b> {{generally}} leads, {{through the}} diversification effect, to reduced {{risk for the}} combined entity. As is well known, in perfect capital markets such risk reduction will not be beneficial to stockholders, since they can achieve on their own the preferred degree of risk in their "homemade" portfolios. What, then, is the motive for the widespread and persisting phenomenon of conglomerate mergers? In this study a "managerial" motive for <b>conglomerate</b> <b>merger</b> is advanced and tested. Specifically, managers, as opposed to investors, are hypothesized to engage in conglomerate mergers to decrease their largely undiversifiable "employment risk" (i. e., risk of losing job, professional reputation, etc.). Such risk-reduction activities are considered here as managerial perquisites {{in the context of}} the agency cost model. This hypothesis about <b>conglomerate</b> <b>merger</b> motivation is empirically examined in two different tests and found to be consistent with the data. ...|$|E

40|$|The article {{offers a}} {{complementary}} theory for conglomerate mergers. The central {{argument is that}} a <b>conglomerate</b> <b>merger</b> may be a vertical merger in disguise. The acquisition of a non-competing firm takes place to achieve control over the target's distribution channel that otherwise {{could be used by}} rival entrants. The analysis shows that an entrant with a very differentiated product is accommodated, and an entrant with a close substitute is foreclosed through a <b>conglomerate</b> <b>merger.</b> There also exist equilibria with partial foreclosure where the entrant is forced onto less efficient distribution channels.

40|$|Abstract: After the Celler-Kefauver Act, {{case law}} evolved for the {{application}} to <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers</b> of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. Given the way that antitrust enforcement procedures have evolved since the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the portions of the Supreme Court decisions that constitute the case law about <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers</b> have been largely dormant. During the same period when enforcement practices turned away from using the case law toward <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers,</b> economists have developed theory and evidence supporting the hypothesis that multimarket contact among diversified sellers can create market power in the individual markets in which the sellers compete – the multimarket contact hypothesis. The hypothesis has implications for Section 7 Clayton Act enforcement actions toward both <b>conglomerate</b> and horizontal <b>mergers.</b> This chapter briefly recaps the case law and the enforcement history, then reviews the theory and evidence supporting the multimarket contact hypothesis, and finally develops {{the implications of the}} hypothesis for the antitrust law toward mergers...|$|R

40|$|This paper takes a {{close look}} at the {{extraordinarily}} high premerger profit rates of target companies during the <b>conglomerate</b> <b>merger</b> wave. Both publicly traded. and privately owned targets were significantly more profitable than other firms in their industries and size classes.

This suggests that managerial discipline may have been important for the few takeovers that involved large publicly traded targets. Copyright 1993 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{develops}} {{a theory of}} mergers and divestitures. The motivation stems from inability to finance marginally profitable projects as stand-alones due to agency problems. A <b>conglomerate</b> <b>merger</b> is a technology that allows these projects to survive a period of distress. If profitability improves, the financing synergy ends and the acquirer divests the assets. The authors' theory reconciles two seemingly contradictory empirical findings.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} relationship between <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers</b> and changes in concentration in 193 manufacturing industries. The theoretical bases suggesting the possibility of such a relationship are explained, as are the theoretical implications of any such relationship. An ordinary least squares multiple regression model is presented for use in analyzing changes in four-firm and eight-firm concentration ratios (CR- 4 and CR- 8, respectively) {{in an attempt to}} infer {{the extent to which the}} practices of reciprocity, cross-subsidization, and/or mutual forbearance are used to affect the market shares of firms acquired in conglomerate mergers;Descriptive statistics for changes in CR- 4 and CR- 8 in the sample industries during the period 1967 - 77 are presented. These statistics show, inter alia, that: (1) concentration in consumer-goods industries has increased and concentration in producer-goods industries has decreased, and (2) the number of <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers</b> seems to be inversely related to changes in concentration. The latter result is referred to as the 2 ̆ 2 dampening relation 2 ̆ 2 between <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers</b> and changes in industry concentration;The results from estimation of the regression model are generally consistent with results from previous studies. They provide no support for theories predicting that <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers</b> result in increases in industry concentration, and they provide only very weak evidence that such mergers lead to decreases in concentration. Thus, the wide-spread use of reciprocity or cross-subsidization to increase the market shares of acquired firms cannot be inferred from this study. However, various further regression analyses support the existence of the dampening relation suggested by the descriptive Statistics and Probability; This result is consistent with the theory of mutual forbearance between large diversified firms...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the stock market response to acquisition announcements during and immediately after the <b>conglomerate</b> <b>merger</b> wave of the late 1960 s. The main finding is that acquirer shareholders benefited from diversification acquisitions, which implies that diversification was not driven by managerial objectives. It is also shown that the market responded positively to bidders who retained the management of target companies and negatively to bidders who replaced target management. This {{is consistent with the}} hypothesis that the market favored acquisitions intended to exploit managerial synergies. It suggests that the market disliked takeovers that were motivated to discipline target management. Evidence on buyer and target price-earnings ratios is presented that is inconsistent with the conjecture that conglomerates were able to mislead investors by earnings-per-share manipulation. ...|$|E

40|$|Issues of multimarket contact have {{recently}} been raised in European merger cases. Coordinated e¤ects have thus been recognized as a potential reason for blocking <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers</b> (or hor-izontal <b>mergers</b> with <b>conglomerate</b> aspects). In this paper we analyze the impacts of incremental <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers</b> on the scope for collusion. In a simple benchmark model we show {{that the ability to}} collude does not depend on the number of 8 ̆ 5 rms that are present in multiple markets. We derive a neutrality benchmark for mergers and show that there is a pivotal merger that creates all of the collusion potential.

We then show the fundamental di¤erence between mergers that link asymmetric markets with symmetric 8 ̆ 5 rms from mergers with symmetric markets but complementary asymmetries between 8 ̆ 5 rms. While in the 8 ̆ 5 rst case the price in one market typically falls as a result of coordinated e¤ects, all prices rise in the latter case. We discuss the consequences for competition policy rules.

40|$|In {{the context}} of <b>conglomerate</b> <b>merger</b> review, {{portfolio}} effects seem {{to refer to the}} pro- and anti-competitive effects possibly arising when: the parties enjoy market power but not necessarily dominance; and the products joined are complementary or have analogous properties. When complementary products are merged, there is a potential for considerable synergies that could benefit buyers. There is also an increased potential for forced tying, pure bundling, or analogous practices (e. g. full line forcing) that could restrict buyer choice but also lower prices. Under certain strict conditions, consumers could gain in the short run but suffer long term harm from such practices if they eventually result in a sufficient reduction of competitors and capacity in a market. The hypothetical nature of such harm has led some to conclude that instead of prohibiting mergers having potentially harmful portfolio effects, competition agencies should instead take a wait and see attitude. That would involve using abuse of dominance or monopolisation prohibitions to control negative effects should they actually materialise. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It {{has long}} been thought that {{government}} antitrust policy {{has an effect on}} aggregate merger and acquisition activity, but the empirical support for this hypothesis has been weak and inconsistent. This paper uses a new empirical specification and a new dataset on mergers and acquisitions to provide support for this conjecture. Regression analysis shows that government policy has a significant influence on mergers and that the nature of the effects depends on the type of merger. Fitting the time series into a two-state Markov switching model shows that conglomerate and horizontal time series follow different dynamics for the last half century, which is most likely caused by the dissimilar treatment of the two types of merger by the government. Only the <b>conglomerate</b> <b>merger</b> and acquisition time series is well described by a two-state Markov switching model. In contrast, the horizontal time series has a break in the early 1980 s that may be attributed to the dramatic change in government policy.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} mergers and divestitures wherein the motivation for mergers stems from the inability to finance marginally profitable, possibly short-horizon projects as stand-alone entities due to agency problems between managers and potential claimholders. A <b>conglomerate</b> <b>merger</b> {{can be viewed as}} a technology that allows a marginally profitable project, which could not obtain financing as a stand-alone, to obtain financing and survive a period of distress. If profitability improves, the financing synergy ends and the acquirer divests assets to avoid coordination costs. Since it is the project's ability to survive as a stand-alone that causes the divestiture, divestiture decisions are interpreted as good news by the market in our model. Further, our theory is able to reconcile two important but seemingly contradictory empirical findings: 1) mergers increase the combined value of the acquirer and target (Jensen and Ruback (1983), Bradley et al. (1988) and Kaplan Weisbach (1992)) : and, 2) diversified firms are less valuable than more focused stand-alone entities (Berger and Ofek (1995), Lang and Stulz (1994), and Servaes (1996)). Diversification adds value in our model by facilitating the financing of positive net present value projects that cannot be financed as stand-alones. At the same time, because these same projects are only marginally profitable, diversified firms are less valuable than stand-alones. ...|$|E
40|$|In an {{increasingly}} competitive market, the corporate sectors in small {{developing countries are}} adopting a number of strategies to deal with raising efficiency and productivity. One such strategy is consolidation, that is, mergers and acquisitions. One of the primary motive to undertake a merger is to gain the synergy that would accrue from more efficient management, economies of scale and scope, removal of duplication of resources, utilization of resources to their full potential, and improved production techniques. This study examines the basis of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and utilizing two recent cases of M & A applications, provides a theoretical and practical basis to decide on whether mergers and acquisitions will be allowed or not. In doing so, we demonstrate the process and methodologies utilized to assess and examine an M & A application. The first case involves a <b>conglomerate</b> <b>merger</b> in the beverage industry while the other involves an acquisition in the same industry.

In the first case, the merger involved two different kinds of beverage activity - alcoholic and soft drinks beverage hence there was {{no effect on the}} market share of the individual products. In the second case, while the acquisition was in the same industry, a detailed financial analysis of the acquired firm reveals that it is a “failing firm”, and therefore, in the public interest, the acquisition needs to be cleared. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Mergers and {{acquisitions}} have gained enormous {{popularity in the}} recent past. There have been five trends in the previous century alone. There is however, a conflict in the literature regarding the impacts of such financial activities. While some researchers support mergers due to the financial profits associated with them, others argue against them as not being very favourable for the shareholders of the companies. This research therefore aims at calculating any abnormal returns to the shareholders of the acquiring companies using statistical model i. e. the event study. For this purpose, the data was divided into sub-samples according to the industry types; intra-industry mergers (horizontal and vertical <b>mergers)</b> and <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers.</b> The overall sample resulted in a CAAR of - 1. 22 % over the 11 day event window; - 5, - 4, - 3, - 2, - 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The data included merger deals including UK public limited companies from 2002 till {{the second quarter of}} 2007. Moreover, <b>conglomerate</b> <b>mergers</b> reported a higher negative CAAR of - 2. 16 % than the intra-industry mergers, which had a negative CAAR of - 0. 52 %. Thus, from the event study, it is evident that mergers tend to result in negative CAAR for the acquiring companies. OLS Regression was then performed to statically choose the better type of merger for the shareholders of the companies involved. It also showed similar results that intra-industry mergers tend to be a better alternative to earn returns for the shareholders, atleast in the short run. These results could not be confirmed as the model used showed some lacking...|$|R
