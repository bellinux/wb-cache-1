500|$|... "Beyond Blunderdome" [...] {{was written}} by then-showrunner Mike Scully and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore, airing {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). It was Scully's first writing credit since he took over as showrunner for the show. In comparison with other episode scripts, the staff writers did not change much of the original writing. The plot revolves around Mel Gibson doing a remake of the 1939 film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay analysed the episode and wrote in the book The Simpsons in the Classroom: Embiggening the Learning Experience with the Wisdom of Springfield that [...] "the episode is able to critique the practice of test screening, violence in film, and one of movies' favorite standards – the car chase", calling it [...] "a ridiculous parody of an action-film violence orgy". Staff writer Tom Gammill {{came up with the idea}} for the violent version of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and Gibson throwing his Senator badge away at the end of the film, is a reference to the ending of the film Dirty Harry from 1971. The idea for the set piece with electric cars at the beginning of the episode came from Kevin Nealon, who was a friend of former showrunner David Mirkin. One day, he <b>came</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> demonstrated his electric car for the writing staff.|$|E
