40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel single-pot synthesis process based on sol–gel {{for the production}} of a highly transparent hybrid matrix containing CdS nanoparticles (NPs). The reaction between <b>cadmium</b> and <b>sulphide</b> ions in the presence of 3 -mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) that originates the formation of quantum confined CdS NPs occurs simultaneously with the condensation and polymerization of the gel precursors that evolves to a macromolecular hybrid organic–inorganic network. The obtained xerogel matrix is based on the reaction of organically modified alkoxysilane (3 -isocyanatepropyltriethoxysilane) and a di-amine functionalized oligopolyoxyethylene (Jeffamine ED- 600). The final material is characterized as highly transparent, homogeneous and flexible xerogel incorporating stabilized and high crystalline CdS NPs that exhibit size-dependent optical properties due to quantum confinement of photogenerated e-h pairs as observed from UV–visible and photoluminescence spectroscopy and HRTEM microscopy measurements. The developed approach has obvious advantages comparatively to the alternative and more complex routes of production of composite materials with embedded semiconductor NPs because of the simplified one-pot preparative procedure used. The developed sol–gel process allows the control of the optical characteristics of the obtained CdS NPs embedded within the network by adjusting the molar ratio between cadmium ion and MPTMS and between <b>cadmium</b> and <b>sulphide</b> ions.

40|$|The {{chemical}} and physical alterations of cadmium yellow (CdS) paints in Henri Matisse’s The Joy of Life (1905 – 1906, The Barnes Foundation) {{have been recognized}} since 2006, when a survey by portable X-ray fluorescence identified this pigment in all altered regions of the monumental painting. This alteration is visible as fading, discoloration, chalking, flaking, and spalling of several regions of light to medium yellow paint. Since that time, synchrotron radiation-based techniques including elemental and spectroscopic imaging, as well as X-ray scattering have been employed to locate and identify the alteration products observed in this and related works by Henri Matisse. This information is necessary to formulate one or multiple mechanisms for degradation of Matisse’s paints from this period, and thus ensure proper environmental conditions for the storage and the display of his works. This paper focuses on 2 D full-field X-ray Near Edge Structure imaging, 2 D micro-X-ray Diffraction, X-ray Fluorescence, and Fourier Transform Infra-red imaging of the altered paint layers to address one of the long-standing questions about cadmium yellow alteration—the roles of cadmium carbonates and cadmium sulphates found in the altered paint layers. These compounds have often been assumed to be photo-oxidation products, but could also be residual starting reagents from an indirect wet process synthesis of CdS. The data presented here allow identifying and mapping the location of cadmium carbonates, cadmium chlorides, cadmium oxalates, cadmium sulphates, and <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphides</b> in thin sections of altered cadmium yellow paints from The Joy of Life and Matisse’s Flower Piece (1906, The Barnes Foundation).

A model {{to describe the}} absoprtion spectra of cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanoplatelets (NPLs) has been developed, which allows the extraction of parameters relating to excitons confined within {{the thickness of the}} NPLs. Giant oscillator strength transitions (GOST) have been observed in NPLs with a lifetime limited dephasing of the ground state excitons at low temperature of about 1 ps, using transient resonant four wave mixing in heterodyne detection. The observation of the GOST effect has been affirmed by a decrease in the low temperature dephasing time with increasing NPL area. In addition, in <b>cadmium</b> selenide/cadmium <b>sulphide</b> (CdSe/CdS) quantum dot in rod (QDR) samples, dephasing dynamics at low temperature have been described by a Gaussian distribution of decay rates. Density dynamics have shown a fast initial decay followed by a signal rise attributed to an interplay between acoustic phonons and fast population dynamics related to the QDR fine structure.

The strains also grew in the presence of cadmium, however variations were observed with respect to cadmium toxicity between the cultures as revealed by their patterns of lactate utilization, acetate production, sulphate-reduction and protein production. Desulfovibrio vulgaris DSM 644 showed the least tolerance while Desulfovibrio desulfuricans DSM 1926 and Desulfococcus multivorans DSM 2059 showed maximum tolerance towards cadmium. Treatments with cadmium in combination of either phenol, benzoic acid or catechol showed no significant effect on growth compared to growth on cadmium alone for three SRB strains tested. However, a mixed SRB culture showed decreased tolerance to cadmium in the presence of phenol, benzoic acid and catechol and Desulfomicrobium norvegicans II showed increased tolerance to cadmium in presence of phenol and benzoic acid. All SRB strains tested were found capable to precipitate <b>cadmium</b> as <b>sulphide</b> from the growth medium.

The research described herein was aimed at developing novel methods to investigate potential roadblocks to the trafficking of non-viral DNA delivery systems and to develop novel and safer non-viral delivery systems. ^ As a novel approach to assessing intracellular DNA stability, plasmid DNA was dual labeled with rhodamine and fluorescein at two different sites. Gel-electrophoresis and time-lapse confocal microscopy confirmed visualization of DNA as a yellow color due to the close proximity of two fluorophores and separation of colors {{in the event of}} strand break. Thus color separation is a probable indication of DNA degradation inside cells. ^ To overcome photo-instability limitations of organic fluorophores, quantum dots (QDs) conjugated plasmid DNA was utilized, for long-term single cell tracking studies. Plasmid DNA-QD labeling via peptide nucleic acid linkers was facilitated by encapsulating <b>cadmium</b> selenide/zinc <b>sulphide</b> QDs in maleimide functionalized PEG lipids. QD-DNA labeling was confirmed by atomic force microscopy and gel electrophoresis. Transfection efficiencies of QD-DNA conjugates were comparable to unconjugated plasmid DNA demonstrating no loss in DNA functionality. Cellular uptake, cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution of QD-DNA conjugates were evaluated using confocal microscopy. QD-DNA conjugates were non-toxic as revealed by cytotoxicity assay and provide a unique tool for investigation of intracellular trafficking. ^ As an approach to develop a safe and efficient DNA delivery system, anionic liposomal systems formed by complexing 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phospho-glycerol/ 1, 2 -dioleoyl- sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine (anionic/zwitterionic lipid) liposomes with plasmid DNA and Ca 2 + were developed and optimized for high transfection efficiency and low cytotoxicity. Particle size analysis, gel electrophoresis, transmission electron microscopy and confocal studies assisted in characterization of optimized formulations. Maximum transfection efficiency occurred at 15 - 20 mM Ca 2 + and 20 / 80 (anionic/zwitterionic lipid) and at high lipid/DNA ratios, 15 – 20 μg/ 0. 8 μg. The transfection efficiency and cell viability of anionic lipoplexes in serum were ∼ 78 % and ∼ 93 %, respectively, which was comparable to cationic lipoplexes, which had transfection efficiency and cell viability values of ∼ 68 % and ∼ 35 %, respectively.

Gweru's sole official waste disposal site is surrounded by numerous plots of land where residents grow staple maize, sweet potatoes and other food crops for subsistence. Ingestion of crop produce from the dumpsite area and its vicinity is likely to put lives at risk. This paper assesses the concentration levels of toxic chemicals lead (pb), <b>cadmium</b> (cd); and <b>sulphides</b> (so 2) within and around Gweru dumpsite. Sampling points for soil were randomly selected using Arcview GIS along each transect on the dumpsite and its environs in order to assess the concentration of each of the chemicals from one point to the adjacent one.; Chemicals concentrations were determined through Leco Machine tests for sulphides and Atomic Absorption Spectrometer for lead and cadmium. Independent t-test results revealed that the concentration levels for the three pollutants are significantly (p< 0, 05) higher within the dump, compared to its surroundings, indicating that the dump is the source of toxic chemicals.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In this work cadmium telluride thin film photovoltaic devices have successfully been produced using a novel closed-field magnetron sputtering technique. This technique offers the possibility of producing cells in an all-in-one vacuum process {{with the potential to}} provide a new lower cost production route. The sputtered cadmium telluride layers were characterised in detail using a range of advanced microscopy based techniques both in the as deposited and after the cadmium chloride treated state, a treatment that is necessary to produce a working cell. In the as deposited condition the cadmium telluride layer was seen to have a fine-grained columnar structure containing a high density of stacking faults. After the cadmium chloride treatment these grains recrystallized and the new grains were equiaxed with a much lower density of intragranular defects. Similar effects were also observed in samples prepared using close space sublimation. To understand this recrystallization behaviour during the cadmium chloride treatment, the key treatment parameters were systematically varied. Chemical analysis in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) showed that chlorine travelled down the cadmium telluride grain boundaries and accumulated adjacent to the <b>cadmium</b> telluride/cadmium <b>sulphide</b> interface. This interface is where the cadmium telluride grains were found to recrystallise first during interrupted cadmium chloride treatments. The nature of the stacking faults was examined using High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM). This showed that in localised regions up to one plane of atoms per sequence was missing based on the expected zinc blende structure. This changed the packing of the atoms such that a local change in crystal structure occurred. This local change in phase was successfully mapped using Electron Backscatter Diffraction in planar section produced using Focused Ion Beam milling. This was subsequently studied in more detail using Transmission Electron Backscatter Diffraction in the Scanning Electron Microscope, where the intra-granular arrangement of the phases was observed. HR-TEM was used to quantitatively measure the linear defects in the cadmium telluride layer after thermal annealing with and without the cadmium chloride present. This showed that annealing alone resulted in only a modest reduction in the density of linear defects and grain recrysallisation only occurred in the presence of cadmium chloride. Cadmium magnesium telluride (CMT) was successfully grown epitaxially onto the cadmium telluride as an electron reflector layer to improve cell performance. During deposition the cell experienced high temperatures and this caused the stacking faults to return in a cell that had been previously cadmium chloride treated.
