25|$|The jacket harness is a {{waistcoat}} (vest) style garment {{with strong}} adjustable webbing straps which are adjustable and securely buckled over the shoulders, across {{the chest and}} waist, and through the crotch or around each thigh, so that the diver can not slide out under any predictable circumstance. The harness is fitted with several heavy duty D-rings, fixed to the webbing {{in such a way}} that the full weight of the diver and all his equipment can be safely supported. A minimum strength of 500kgf is recommended or required by some codes of practice. A jacket harness is usually provided with webbing straps or a <b>cloth</b> <b>pocket</b> on the back to support the bailout cylinder, and may have a variety of pockets to carry tools, and may also carry ditchable or fixed main weights. There are usually several strong D-rings to secure the umbilical and other equipment.|$|E
5000|$|The Ventriloquist is {{an album}} by Ruby Throat, a musical act {{consisting}} of Katiejane Garside (frontwoman of Queen Adreena) and Chris Whittingham. It {{was released on}} 8 November 2007 on a limited run of only 500 copies. This consisted of books bound from Indian vintage red leather, the CD in a <b>cloth</b> <b>pocket</b> {{in the back of}} the book. Another limited version of 400 copies was released on January 16, 2008, this time in a regular jewelled case and a 4-panel CD booklet. There was a worldwide general release later in 2008, but [...] "Marybell" [...] was replaced on this edition by two new tracks, [...] "Consuela's Newt" [...] and [...] "Boat Song." [...] An official limited edition run of 300 gatefold double vinyl LPs were issued in Spring 2010 by Los Angeles-based label, The Lovers' Will Records & Press.|$|E

50|$|When Zalmon G. Simmons II {{took over}} the company after his father’s death in 1910 he {{continued}} the tradition of innovation set by his predecessor. The greatest example came in 1925 {{with the introduction of}} the Beautyrest mattress. This new mass-produced innerspring mattress was made of individual <b>cloth</b> <b>pocketed</b> coils that contoured to the body and led to a new world of sleep comfort. While the younger Simmons did not invent the pocketed coil innerspring mattress he facilitated a way to mass-produce it.|$|R
5000|$|Chemical reaction-based {{garments}} have <b>cloth</b> pouches or <b>pockets</b> where single-use {{packages of}} chemical hand warmers can be inserted. The hand warmers {{are about the}} size of a package of cards, and they contain chemicals which produce heat. One traditional hand warmer is a small metal box containing charcoal which, when lit, burns very slowly and produces a mild heat. Disposable heat packs typically contain cellulose, iron, water, activated carbon, vermiculite, and salt. When these packs are exposed to air, an exothermic chemical reaction occurs, which provides several hours of heat. Another chemical heating pad uses a gel that can be activated by twisting the package, thus triggering a chemical reaction. The pack can be put in a pot of boiling water to convert the chemical reaction back and allow it to be reused. While these products are commonly called [...] "hand warmers", they can be placed in boots or, with special garments such as vests, in <b>cloth</b> <b>pockets</b> on the inside of the garment. The temperature tends to be lowest among above heating methods.|$|R
5000|$|Bandolier: A {{rectangular}} {{piece of}} <b>cloth</b> with 5 <b>pockets</b> and a shoulder strap. Each pocket carried (2) 5-round Mauser-style stripper clips {{for a total}} of 50 rounds. It went through 3 marks and 4 versions during the war (Marks I, II, III, and III/1).|$|R
50|$|In 1901, a {{planning}} mill operator in Canada named James Marshall patented the first innerspring mattress with individual cloth pocketed coils. He produced the inner-springs {{with a machine}} that hand cranked a single coil that was then sewn into a <b>cloth</b> <b>pocket.</b> The process was repeated multiple times to create one mattress. Since the Marshall inner-springs were made by hand they were very expensive, appearing only in few lavish hotels and on luxury ships such as the Titanic and the Lusitania. When Marshall’s patent expired in 1917 the mattress was still unknown {{to the majority of}} the general public. Z.G. Simmons II knew the Marshall innerspring was a quality mattress but the price kept it from being a profitable product. In 1922 he charged a top Simmons engineer named John Franklin Gail with the task of inventing a machine that could mass-produce pocketed coil inner-springs. Gail was sent to Evanston, Illinois, away from the distractions of the Kenosha plant, with instructions to work on no other project until it was completed. After three years of dedication Gail finally returned to “the Chief” with the “Beautyrest Pocket Machine”, a piece of machinery that revolutionized the bedding manufacturing industry. The release of this new mattress, that brought comfort to the Everyman, not only changed the manufacturing industry but also the sales and marketing industries.|$|E
50|$|In World War I and World War II, bandoliers {{were issued}} {{primarily}} to riflemen. They {{were made of}} <b>cloth,</b> stitched into <b>pockets</b> which held clips of rifle ammunition. Today, bandoliers are commonly used to carry multiple grenade rounds. In civilian use, bandoliers are often worn by hunters and recreational shooters using shotguns.|$|R
50|$|A belt or {{ammunition}} belt is a device used to retain and feed cartridges into a firearm commonly used on machine guns. Belts were originally composed of canvas or <b>cloth</b> with <b>pockets</b> spaced evenly {{to allow the}} belt to be mechanically fed into the gun. These designs were prone to malfunctions due {{to the effects of}} oil and other contaminants altering the belt. Later belt designs used permanently connected metal links to retain the cartridges during feeding. These belts were more tolerant to exposure to solvents and oil. Some notable weapons that use belts are the M240, the M249, the M134 Minigun, and the PK Machine Gun.|$|R
50|$|Cue Club 2 expands on the {{original}} game with new artwork, additional characters, table designs, cues and ball sets. Both the size and design of the cues and balls can be modified. The table <b>cloth,</b> <b>pockets</b> and rails can also be customized, along {{with the speed of}} the table. The method of cueing may also be adjusted. Additionally, players are able to choose from a selection of colored chalk. The developers state that the physics engine has been overhauled and the A.I. of the computer opponents significantly improved. Two new bonus games have been added, including a revised Slam mode, where balls can be swung round on a length of cord, and also Detonator mode where the balls explode on impact (which was formerly a cheat option in {{the original}} Cue Club). Players can save shots and replay them at a variety of speeds, and also save their highest snooker breaks and speed pool times in the Hall of Fame, and watch these performances back later. A selection of nine new soundtracks were also composed for the title, serving as background music to complement gameplay. In an attempt to stay true to its roots the developers retained recognizable styling elements from the first game, but made several important technical improvements to enable support for widescreen and touchscreen monitors, and also 1080p High Definition graphics and 4K displays. The software is capable of supporting multiple resolutions depending on the user's current Windows desktop settings, and adaptive scaling ensures that the table fills the screen, irrespective of the aspect ratio, with no stretching or image distortion.|$|R
50|$|Garments {{that use}} gel have <b>cloth</b> pouches or <b>pockets</b> where plastic {{packages}} of the gel can be {{inserted in the}} garment. Prior to going outdoors, the gel is heated up in a microwave. Once outdoors, the gel pack retains its heat for between 30 minutes and two hours, {{depending on the size}} of the gel pack, the thickness of the insulation protecting the gel pack from the outdoor temperatures, and the outdoor temperature and wind conditions.|$|R
5|$|It {{was first}} {{published}} in the United States by W. & S.B. Ives in Salem, Massachusetts on November 25, 1843. Their game was a folding game board with a <b>cloth</b> and cardboard <b>pocket</b> attached {{to the bottom of the}} game board along its edge. In the pocket were the rules, implements, and teetotum. Its teetotum was an ivory dowel sharpened to a point at the bottom end inserted in an octagonal ivory plate. This type of teetotum was referred to as a pin and plate teetotum.|$|R
60|$|Here I should {{state that}} those two metal maps and the ring which I gave to Yva and found again after the catastrophe, were {{absolutely}} the only things connected with her or with Oro that we brought away with us. The former I would never part with, feeling their value as evidence. Therefore, when we descended to the city Nyo and the depths beneath, I took them with me wrapped in <b>cloth</b> in my <b>pocket.</b> Thus they were preserved. Everything else went when the Rock of Offerings and the cave mouth sank beneath {{the waters of the}} lake.|$|R
60|$|The {{path was}} {{becoming}} rocky and {{difficult for the}} wheels of the chariot to pass over, and presently a deep gulf appeared at their feet which was too wide for them to leap. So Ozma took a small square of green <b>cloth</b> from her <b>pocket</b> and threw it upon the ground. At once it became the magic carpet, and unrolled itself far enough for all the cavalcade to walk upon. The chariot now advanced, and the green carpet unrolled before it, crossing the gulf on a level with its banks, so that all passed over in safety.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, Mattel {{redesigned}} Polly Pocket {{and created}} {{a new series of}} collectible items. The new doll is larger and has a more lifelike appearance than the original dolls. That same year, Mattel also introduced Fashion Polly!, which used the same characters from the new Polly Pocket (Polly, Lea, Shani, Lila, etc.), but they {{came in the form of}} 3+3/4 in plastic jointed dolls. They gave a new spin on fashion dolls; instead of traditional <b>cloth</b> clothing, Polly <b>Pockets</b> used unique [...] "Polly Stretch" [...] garments, created by Genie Toys, rubbery plastic clothes that could be put on the dolls and removed. There are also some boy dolls (Rick, Steven, etc.) Like Barbie and Bratz dolls, they also star in Polly Pocket movies, books, and sites.|$|R
5000|$|There is no {{detectable}} {{difference in}} rates of diaper rash in conventional disposable diaper wearers and reusable cloth diaper wearers. [...] "Babies wearing superabsorbent disposable diapers {{with a central}} gelling material have fewer episodes of diaper dermatitis compared with their counterparts wearing cloth diapers. However, {{keep in mind that}} superabsorbent diapers contain dyes that were suspected to cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD)." [...] Whether wearing cloth or disposable diapers they should be changed frequently to prevent diaper rash, even if they don't feel wet. To reduce the incidence of diaper rash, disposable diapers have been engineered to pull moisture away from the baby's skin using synthetic non-biodegradable gel. Today, cloth diapers use newly available superabsorbent microfiber cloth placed in a pocket with a layer of light permeable material that contacts the skin. This design serves to pull moisture away from the skin in to the microfiber cloth. This technology is used in most major <b>pocket</b> <b>cloth</b> diapers brands today.|$|R
50|$|This type of belt {{consists}} of a design that can be reused, as it does not fall apart during function, similar to a feed strip. This is found on only a few types of machine guns, such as the Soviet DShK and RPD, the German MG-42 and the British Vickers, which used a non-disintegrating canvas and brass belt. Arguably, precursors to the belt-fed machine gun were the Cass rifle, patented in 1848, and the Treeby chain gun, patented in the 1850s. Belts were originally composed of canvas or <b>cloth</b> with <b>pockets</b> spaced evenly to allow the belt to be mechanically fed into the gun. These designs were prone to malfunctions due {{to the effects of}} oil and other contaminants altering the belt. Later belt designs used permanently connected metal links to retain the cartridges during feeding, such as on the Vickers Gun. These belts were more tolerant to exposure to solvents and oil. Despite it being a more efficient system, few are still used, possibly due to the added cost and effort. Non-disintegrating belts often come in pieces of limited length connected by disintegrating link, and after being fed through the weapon the piece falls off, limiting the length of the used belt hanging from the weapon to no more than one such piece. Many weapons designed to use non-disintegrating or canvas belts are provided with machines to automatically reload these belts with loose rounds or rounds held in stripper clips. In use during World War I, reloaders allowed ammunition belts to be recycled quickly to allow practically continuous fire.|$|R

60|$|The {{first of}} all English games is making money. That is an all-absorbing game; and we knock each other down oftener in playing at that than at foot-ball, or any other roughest sport; and it is {{absolutely}} without purpose; no one who engages heartily in that game ever knows why. Ask a great money-maker {{what he wants to}} do with his money--he never knows. He doesn't make it to do anything with it. He gets it only that he may get it. 'What will you make of what you have got?' you ask. 'Well, I'll get more,' he says. Just as, at cricket, you get more runs. There's no use in the runs, but to get more of them than other people is the game. And there's no use in the money, but to have more of it than other people is the game. So all that great foul city of London there,--rattling, growling, smoking, stinking,--a ghastly heap of fermenting brick-work, pouring out poison at every pore,--you fancy it is a city of work? Not a street of it! It is a great city of play; very nasty play, and very hard play, but still play. It is only Lord's cricket ground without the turf,--a huge billiard table without the <b>cloth,</b> and with <b>pockets</b> as deep as the bottomless pit; but mainly a billiard table, after all.|$|R
6000|$|In those days, {{now more}} than half a century ago, when Archdeacon Heathcote was Vicar, he or his Curate used to ride over from Hursley on Sunday for the service at Otterbourne. There was only one service, {{alternately}} in the morning and afternoon, at half-past ten or at three, or in the winter at half-past two. The time was not much fixed, for on a new comer asking when the service would take place, the answer was [...] "at half-past two, sir, or at three, or else no time at all," [...] by which was meant no exact hour or half-hour. This uncertainty led to the bells never being rung till the minister was seen turning the corner of Kiln- lane, just where the large boulder stone used to be. The congregation was, however, collecting, almost all the men in white smocks with beautifully worked breasts and backs, the more well-to-do in velveteen; the women in huge bonnets. The elder ones wore black silk or satin bonnets, with high crowns and big fronts, the younger ones, straw with ribbon crossed over, always with a bonnet cap under. A red cloak was the regular old women's dress, or a black or blue one, and sometimes a square shawl, folded so as to make a triangle, over a gown of stuff in winter, print in summer. A blue printed cotton with white or yellow sprays was the regular week day dress, and the poorest wore it on Sundays. The little girls in the aisle had the like big coarse straw bonnets, with a strip of glazed calico hemmed and crossed over for strings, round tippets, and straight print frocks down to their feet. The boys were in small smocks, of either white or green canvas, with fustian or corduroy jackets or trowsers below, never <b>cloth.</b> Gloves and <b>pocket</b> handkerchiefs were hardly known among the children, hardly an umbrella, far less parasols or muffs. Ladies had pelisses for out-of-door wear, fitting close like ulsters, but made of dark green or purple silk or merino, and white worked dresses under them in summer.|$|R
