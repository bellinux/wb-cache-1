25|$|Even {{excluding}} Sussex and London, South-east England {{has been}} one of the key areas of English folk music and collection. It had retained a strong tradition of wassailing, and seafaring songs were important in the coastal counties of Kent and Hampshire. Arguably the published collection of oral material was made in this area by John Broadwood, as Old English Songs, As Now Sung by the Peasantry of the Weald of Surrey and Sussex (1843). When the first revival was at its height in the first decade of the 20th century, George Gardiner and Alice Gillington both collected songs in Hampshire, Lucy Broadwood in Surrey, Hampshire and Oxfordshire, Alfred Williams in Oxfordshire and Berkshire and Cecil Sharp in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Kent. In the second folk revival the region contributed several figures, with probably the most important being Martin Carthy from Hertfordshire. The most significant British folk rock group from the region were the Oyster Band, formed in Canterbury, while guitarist John Martyn came from Surrey and fiddle player Chris Leslie from Banbury in Oxfordshire. From the <b>current</b> <b>crop</b> of young folk musicians probably the most prominent are Spiers and Boden from Oxfordshire and Chris Wood, born in Kent. The region is host to numerous folk clubs, and festivals, including the Oxford festival and Fairport’s Cropredy Convention in Oxfordshire and St Albans in Hertfordshire.|$|E

40|$|Salinity of {{the waters}} from the Red River and its major tributaries has {{virtually}} eliminated its use for irrigation of agricultural crops in Texas and Oklahoma. A chloride control project has been proposed whereby the source salt waters will be captured and diverted to storage facilities. The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate the net direct benefits to agricultural producers attributable to the proposed salinity control project. Further, estimates of project costs, municipal and industrial benefits and benefits from improving the water in Lake Kemp were obtained to complete a benefit-cost analysis. The procedure used to estimate agricultural benefits was to use a FORTRAN program to develop initial tableaus of a recursive linear programming model representing agricultural production in the study area. Alternative scenarios involving profit maximizing behavior on the part of producers, <b>current</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns, and with and without SAR crop yield effects were developed to provide a range of benefit estimates. The basis for benefit evaluation was to use parameters prescribed by the U. S. Water Resources Council's Principles and Standards and recent proposed changes along with those developed in this study to estimate the increase in net returns to producers in the study area between a with project and a without project condition for a 100 year period of analysis. Benefits were discounted to their present value with discount rates of 7 1 / 8 percent and 3 1 / 4 percent for comparative purposes. Benefits estimated herein were used in conjunction with external estimates of project costs and other benefits to evaluate the economic feasibility of the salinity control project. In all scenarios considered, cotton emerged as the major irrigated X crop. Scenarios involving profit maximizing behavior on the part of producers resulted in benefit estimates of over $ 65 million and $ 117 million without and with SAR crop yield effects, respectively, at the 7 1 / 8 percent discount rate. Under a constrained profit maximization scenario where SAR crop yield effects were included and in which producers were assumed to keep <b>current</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns in 1990, adjust to 50 percent of the optimal land use in 2000, and were fully adjusted to optimal land use by 2010, resulted in agricultural benefit estimates of over $ 87 million at the 7 1 / 8 percent discount rate. In a scenario where producers were assumed to maintain <b>current</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns throughout the 100 year period of analysis, benefits were estimated to be $ 28. 8 million and $ 35. 8 million without and with SAR crop yield effects, respectively, at the 7 1 / 8 percent discount rate. Benefit-cost analysis performed in this study indicated that the proposed project was economically feasible under assumptions of all scenarios considered except where <b>current</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns were followed for the entire analysis period. B/C ratios of 1. 068 and 1. 291 resulted for the profit maximization scenarios without and with SAR crop yield effects, respectively.

This enhanced Cd accumulation in crops was attributed to root interactions that alter the rhizosphere environment. Co-cultivation with legumes reduced soil pH, which somewhat increased the exchangeable forms of Cd.
