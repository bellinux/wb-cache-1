50|$|The weather at {{the time}} of the {{accident}} was 15 F with 8 in of recent snow. The train was traveling at 33 mph, below the 50 mph speed limit for the area and a 40 mph speed restriction imposed by CSX due to cold weather. The second car in the train (the first tanker <b>car</b> behind the <b>buffer</b> <b>car),</b> through the 28th car derailed. Shortly after the derailment occurred, the train went into emergency braking as a result of the brake line coming apart. The engines traveled 636 ft after this. The train crew must have seen the damage behind them and moved the engines and the <b>buffer</b> <b>car</b> an additional 999 ft away from the accident.|$|R

50|$|The {{train was}} {{composed}} of two locomotives, a covered hopper car acting as a <b>buffer</b> <b>car,</b> 107 tank cars, and a single trailing end <b>buffer</b> <b>car.</b> The train was carrying volatile Bakken crude, from North Dakota's shale fields at Manitou, North Dakota, to an oil shipping depot in Yorktown, Virginia. All of the cars were DOT-111 tank cars meeting the Casualty Prevention Circular (CPC)-1232 industry standard. These so-called CPC-1232's were introduced by the rail industry in 2011 to increase the safety of carrying flammable liquids. However, several accidents involving the cars have brought their effectiveness into doubt.|$|R

50|$|The {{second car}} in the train (the first tanker <b>car</b> behind the <b>buffer</b> <b>car),</b> through the 28th car derailed. The first five of these cars, {{position}} 2 to 6 turned over on their sides. The next 18 cars at position 7 to 24 piled up in a tight accordion style, while the last four cars that derailed at position 25 to 28 were somewhat in line. Cars 7 to 25 released their oil. Only two of the cars were punctured, four leaked due to valve or fitting damage. The remaining 13 suffered from thermal tears. These thermal tears were likely {{the cause of the}} violent fireball eruptions.|$|R
50|$|The {{top speed}} of these railmotors was about 60 to 70 km/h. All had {{conventional}} couplers on both ends, the standard gauge cars with couples of buffers, the narrow gauge <b>cars</b> with single <b>buffers.</b> Thus they could haul up to two lightweight trailers.|$|R
2500|$|Rainwater {{tanks are}} {{designed}} to conserve potable water by harvesting rain and stormwater to partially meet domestic water demands (e.g. during drought periods). In addition, rainwater tanks can reduce stormwater runoff volumes and stormwater pollutants from reaching downstream waterways. They can be used effectively in domestic households as a potential WSUD element. Rain and stormwater from rooftops of buildings can be collected and accessed specifically for purposes such as toilet flushing, laundry, garden watering and <b>car</b> washing. <b>Buffer</b> Tanks [...] allow rain water collected from hard surfaces to seep into the site helps maintain the aquifer and ground water levels.|$|R
40|$|Carnitine (<b>Car)</b> <b>buffers</b> excess acetyl-CoA {{through the}} {{formation}} of acetylCar (AcCar). AcCar's acetyl group (AG-AcCar) {{gives rise to a}} peak at 2. 13 ppm in ¹H MR spectra of skeletal muscle, whereas the trimethylammonium (TMA) groups of both, AcCar and Car, are thought to contribute to the TMA peak at 3. 23 ppm. Surprisingly, in previous studies both resonances, AG-AcCar and TMA, increased after exercise. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess if the exercise-related TMA increase correlated with AcCar production. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (pulse repetition time/echo time = 1200 / 35 ms) was performed before and after prolonged exercise in the lower leg and thigh of eight runners and eight cyclists, respectively. TMA and AG-AcCar increased after exercise (P < 0. 001). TMA's increase correlated with the AG-AcCar increase (R² = 0. 73, P < 0. 001, lower leg; R² = 0. 28, P < 0. 001, thigh). The correlation of ΔTMA with ΔAG-AcCar suggests that the TMA increase is due to AcCar formation. As total Car (Car + AcCar) remains unchanged with exercise, these findings suggest that the contribution of free Car to the TMA peak is limited and, therefore, is partly invisible in muscle ¹H MR spectra. This indicates that the biochemically relevant cytosolic content of free Car is considerably lower than the overall concentration determined by radioisotopic assays, a potentially important result with respect to regulation of substrate oxidation...|$|R

2500|$|The {{locomotives}} and the VB car {{were found}} intact, {{separated from the}} rest of the train approximately [...] east of the derailment site. The equipment that derailed included 63 of the 72 tank cars as well as the <b>buffer</b> <b>car.</b> Nine tank cars at the rear of the train remained on the track and were pulled away from the derailment site and did not explode. Almost all of the derailed tank cars were damaged, many having large breaches. About six million litres of petroleum crude oil was quickly released; the fire began almost immediately.|$|R
25|$|Harding {{left the}} lead {{locomotive}} No.5017 running to keep air pressure supplied to the train's air brakes and also applied {{a number of}} hand brakes. Yves Bourdon, a member of MMA's Board of Directors, stated that the air brakes of all locomotives and freight cars had been activated, as well as hand brakes on 5 locomotives and 10 of the 72 freight cars. However, the TSB agrees with a July 6 statement to police by the train's engineer that he set hand brakes on just the five locomotive engines, a <b>buffer</b> <b>car,</b> and a car housing the remote control apparatus. The engineer also attempted a brake test but incorrectly left the locomotive air brakes on; this gave the false impression that the hand brakes alone would hold the train.|$|R
5000|$|CP runs several freight {{trains in}} both ways along almost {{the full length}} of the subdivision. They do not run {{the full length of}} the line, as the portion that ran {{south-east}} to Union Station was sold to Metrolinx/GO transit. From Lambton Yard west, freight traffic begins on the Galt Subdivision. More recently around October 2010, unit trains have commenced operation on the Galt sub. These bulk-ethanol (except for a <b>buffer</b> <b>car)</b> trains come in the way of train ID numbers 666 and 642 as eastbound loaded movements, with 667 and 643 being the westbound empty return movements. There are many other trains as well, such as manifests, intermodals, double-stacks, autorackers, and even the almost-weekly Expressway train. Regulated operating speeds on the Galt Subdivision range from 50-60 mph/80-96 km/h.|$|R

[...] About six million litres of petroleum crude oil was quickly released; the fire began almost immediately, generating a ball of fire three times the height of the downtown buildings. [...] Heat from the fires was felt as far as 2 km away. People jumped from the third floor of buildings in the central business district to escape the fire. As the blazing oil flowed over the ground, it entered the town's storm sewer and emerged as huge fires towering from other storm sewer drains, manholes, and even chimneys and basements of buildings in the area.|$|R
30|$|Queensland University of Technology in Australia {{improved}} a movable track stiffness measurement vehicle {{based on}} common TLV. This vehicle {{is composed of}} three cars. The front one is a six-axle towing locomotive (weight of 90  tons) to tow the vehicle to the specified measurement point. The middle one is a <b>buffer</b> <b>car</b> for buffering {{the influence of the}} front car on the rear one during the measurement. The rear car is equipped with measurement instruments and is the key part of the vehicle. The rear car weighs 57  tons totally (each part of 14.3  tons) and is equipped with hydraulic jacks and displacement transducers to exert vertical force and measure track deflection basin. When the vehicle reaches the specified measurement point, the hydraulic jacks extend {{from both sides of the}} rear car and act on the track separately. The deflection basin is recorded by 22 transducers to calculate the track modulus.|$|R
30|$|Having fewer <b>cars</b> in the <b>buffer</b> zone will {{initially}} reduce encounters between vulnerable road users (pedestrians and cyclists) and motorized vehicles. Fewer such encounters will also, {{other things}} being equal, lead to fewer road accidents between vehicles and pedestrians. If vulnerable road users are unwary of motorized vehicles (risk compensation), the advantageous effect (a reduction in road accidents) of fewer cars is reduced. Such risk compensation will, however, probably not entirely eliminate the beneficial effect of decreasing the number of motorized vehicles. An increase of vulnerable road users in the area, however, can increase conflicts between cyclists and pedestrians, which might in turn cause more accidents between such road users. Fortunately, traffic accidents involving only such users usually result in injuries of a less serious nature; therefore, an increase in such accidents will unlikely {{be large enough to}} remove the positive impact on road safety of reducing the number of cars.|$|R

40|$|This study {{deals with}} a very common problem {{encountered}} in many automotive industries. Automotive companies try to level the production of different models over time based on the demands for these models in the market. In order to achieve this, they introduce a leveled stream of cars {{in the beginning of}} the production line. But because of many reasons this leveled stream gets disturbed in its course. In order to re-level the stream, buffers are used between the shops. One such buffer is called as selectivity bank and it sits between paint shop and assembly shop. This buffer receives a disturbed sequence from the paint shop. The thesis tries to develop different algorithms that can be used to discharge <b>cars</b> from this <b>buffer</b> in order to achieve better leveling in the presence of rework and assembly constraints. These algorithms continuously try to steer the system from an undesirable state to a more desirable state by keeping track of current conditions in the plant. A simulation model is developed, which gives a platform for comparing relative performance of these logics under different conditions. The simulation tool is also helpful in designing optimum size of this buffer that will result in desired leveling performance...|$|R

The results show that the hydrophobic interactions of the BChl c esterifying alcohols with themselves and the nonpolar carbon skeleton of Car, or the fatty acid tails of MGDG, are essential driving forces for BChl aggregation in chlorosomes.
