40|$|Americans who {{are caught}} evading taxes {{in one year}} may be audited for prior years. While the IRS does not {{disclose}} its method of selecting tax returns for audit, {{it is widely believed}} that a taxpayer´s probability of being audited is an increasing function of current evasion is a decreasing function of prior evasion, since, if audited and caught evading this year, the taxpayer may incur penalties for past evasions. The paper presents a model that formalizes this notion, and derives its implications for the responsiveness of individual and aggregate tax evasion to changes in the economic environment. The aggregate behavior of American taxpayers over the 1947 - 1993 period is consistent with the implications of this model. Specifically, aggregate tax evasion is higher in years in which past evasions are small relative to <b>current</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> -which is the case when incomes or tax rates rise. Furthermore, aggregate audit-related fines and penalties imposed by the IRS are positively related not only to aggregate current- year evasion but also to evasion in prior years. The estimates imply that the average tax evasion rate in the United States over this period is 42 % lower than it would be if taxpayers were unconcerned about retrospetive audits. ...|$|E

40|$|This study quantifies {{costs that}} firms {{are willing to}} incur to avoid {{violation}} of private debt covenants. The results indicate that as firms approach covenant violation they engage in income-increasing earnings management, which increases their <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> By estimating the extent of income-increasing activities and the additional tax costs incurred, this study arrives at a lower-bound estimate {{of the cost of}} violating private debt covenants.

The magnitude of this estimate indicates that the expected costs of covenant violation are meaningful. Combined with recent evidence that private debt covenant violations occur frequently (Dichev and Skinner, 2002; Roberts and Sufi, 2007 a), this implies debt covenants and expected violations are economically important.

40|$|Several {{recent and}} provocative studies have {{described}} portfolio trading strategies which permit investors to avoid all taxes {{on capital gains}} and to shelter {{a substantial part of}} their ordinary income as well. Other studies adopt the more traditional view that the capital gains tax raises the effective tax burden on capital income. This paper uses capital gain realization data from the 1982 IRS Individual Tax Model in an effort to distinguish between these views. It shows that for about one-fifth of the investors who realize gains or losses, the ordinary income loss-offset limitations are binding constraints. Since additional gain realizations do not affect these investors' <b>current</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liability,</b> they may be effectively untaxed on capital gains. Another significant group escapes taxation by not reporting realized gains. However, the largest group of investors trades in a less elaborate and more honest manner, realizing and reporting gains without offsetting losses. The capital gains tax may reduce the after-tax return earned by these investors. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to {{making sure that}} one pays one's taxes for the year by Tax Day, {{it is also important}} to make sure that one has paid partial taxes throughout the tax year in the form of estimated tax payments of employer tax withholding. If one has not done so, then a tax penalty may be assessed. The minimum amount of estimated taxes that need to be paid to avoid penalties depends on a variety of factors, including one's income in the tax year in question as well as one's income in the previous year (in general, if one pays 90% of the <b>current</b> year's <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> or 100% of the previous year's <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> during the <b>tax</b> year, one is not subject to estimated tax penalty even if this year's taxes are higher, but there are some caveats to that rule). Employer withholding is also treated differently from estimated tax payment, in that for the latter, the time of the year when the payment was made matters, whereas for the former, all that matters is how much has been withheld as of the end of the year (though there are other restrictions on how one can adjust one's withholding pattern that need to be enforced by the employer).|$|R
