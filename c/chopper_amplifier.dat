Both the input referred noise and capacitance of the input transistors are important for capacitive sensitivity. Chopping is an effective technique for signal conditioning circuits because of its capability of reducing circuit noise at low frequencies. The capacitive sensitivity and power consumption of various chopping techniques including the dual <b>chopper</b> <b>amplifier</b> (DCA), single <b>chopper</b> <b>amplifier</b> (SCA) and two-stage single <b>chopper</b> <b>amplifier</b> (TCA) are extracted for different values of total gain and sensor capacitance.

A design procedure for chopper amplifiers that illustrates the steps required to achieve either the best or the desired sensitivity while minimizing power consumption will be presented. It will be shown that for a small sensor capacitance and large total gain, the DCA has the best sensitivity, while for a large sensor capacitance and a lower gain, the SCA is preferable.
