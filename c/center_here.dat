5|$|NY11A begins west of {{the village}} of Tully at an {{intersection}} with NY80 near its exit with Interstate81 (I-81) in the hamlet of Tully <b>Center.</b> <b>Here,</b> the route also connects to Lake Road (unsigned County Route134 or CR134), a local highway leading south to on-ramps for I-81 southbound and a chain of waterbodies known as the Tully Lakes. NY11A proceeds northward from NY80 as a two-lane unnamed road, connecting {{to the end of}} a ramp from I-81 southbound before curving northwestward into a rural area of the town. The highway runs through alternating stretches of open, lightly developed terrain and undeveloped woodlands, meeting Solvay Road (CR238) as it descends into Tully Valley, a wide gully surrounding Onondaga Creek. The route heads north along the eastern edge of the isolated valley, following the creek into the adjacent town of LaFayette.|$|E

Phoenician Tavira existed until the end of 6th century BC, when it was destroyed by conflict.|$|E

25|$|While NY63 {{runs along}} {{the western edge of}} the college, US20A and NY39 follow the eastern edge of SUNY Geneseo northward to the village <b>center.</b> <b>Here,</b> the two routes meet Mary Jemison Drive, an east–west street that serves that the only {{connection}} between NY39 west and NY63 north. At the same intersection, US 20A and NY 39 turn east onto South Street; however, the concurrency terminates just one block later at Main Street. Here, NY39 turns north, leaving US20A to proceed east toward the Finger Lakes.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} civilization in the {{territory}} of the current state was that of the Olmecs. The Olmecs lived in the Coatzacoalcos River region and it became the center of Olmec culture. The main ceremonial <b>center</b> <b>here</b> was San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán. Other major centers in the state include Tres Zapotes in the city of Veracruz and La Venta in Tabasco. The culture reached its height about 2600 years ago, with its best-known artistic expression being the colossal stone heads. These ceremonial sites were the most complex of that early time period. For this reason, many anthropologists consider the Olmec civilization to be the mother culture of the many Mesoamerican cultures that followed it. By 300 BCE, this culture was eclipsed by other emerging civilizations in Mesoamerica.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{accounts of}} Blue Licks {{describe it as}} a place where animals gathered to lick the salt deposits flowing from the springs in the area. The Reverend James Smith provides this account in his 1795–97 diary: As you approach the Licks, at the distance of 4 or 5 miles from it, you begin to perceive the change. The earth seems to be worn away; the roots of the trees lie naked and bare; the rocks forsaken of the earth, that once covered them, lie naked on the neighboring hills, and roads of an amazing size, in all directions, unite at the Licks, as their common <b>center.</b> <b>Here</b> immense herds of buffalo used formerly to meet and with their fighting, scraping etc., have worn away the ground to what it is at present.|$|E

500|$|Roughly [...] {{past the}} {{historic}} district, NY120 makes a gradual {{turn to the}} west to reach a junction with NY133 (Millwood Road). NY120 turns onto NY133, following Millwood Road westward into the hamlet of Millwood and its commercial <b>center.</b> <b>Here,</b> the two routes cross the right-of-way of the former Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad and pass by the site of Millwood's station, which was demolished in May 2012 after years of neglect.

500|$|Past NY286, {{the wooded}} areas become more {{sporadic}} as NY350 turns {{to travel in}} a more northwesterly direction across farmlands and fields. It soon enters the town of Ontario, where development along the road increases as it heads into the hamlet of Ontario <b>Center.</b> <b>Here,</b> it passes Wayne High School of the Wayne Central School District prior to intersecting Ridge Road {{in the center of}} the community. This junction once served as Ontario Center's main business district; however, it has been replaced in purpose by the adjacent four-lane NY104, located just [...] north of Ridge Road. NY350 ends upon intersecting the NY104 divided highway; however, Ontario Center Road continues north of the east–west commercial strip for [...] to Lake Road near the Lake Ontario shoreline.|$|E
500|$|The {{overlap between}} NY13 and NY38 {{ends at the}} {{northern}} village line. At this point, NY13 continues north while NY38 forks to the west, running along the village limits on Freeville Road for about [...] through an area with {{only a handful of}} homes. While doing so, the route passes to the south of the Dryden Middle and High School complex. NY38 heads onward through an open, undeveloped area, curving to the northwest and eventually to the north as it approaches the village of Freeville, where it serves the William George Agency for Children's Services at the southern village line. It remains on Freeville Road until Railroad Street, where it turns west and proceeds into the densely populated village <b>center.</b> <b>Here,</b> it intersects the eastern terminus of NY366 at a junction situated adjacent to Fall Creek.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to television acting, Love collaborated with theater producer Todd Almond, starring in Kansas City Choir Boy, a collaborative [...] "pop opera" [...] which showed at the Manhattan arts <b>center</b> <b>Here</b> during their annual Prototype festival in January 2015. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times praised her performance, noting a [...] "soft-edged and bewitching" [...] stage presence, adding: [...] "Her voice, never the most supple or rangy of instruments, retains the singular sound {{that made her}} an electrifying front woman for the band Hole: a single sustained noted can seem to simultaneously contain a plea, a wound and a threat." [...] The show toured later in the year, with performances in Boston and Los Angeles. In early 2015, Love joined Lana Del Rey on her Endless Summer Tour, performing as an opener on the tour's eight West Coast shows. During her tenure on Del Rey's tour, Love debuted a new single, [...] "Miss Narcissist", released on Wavves' independent label Ghost Ramp.

2500|$|In the {{neighboring}} village of Arcade, NY39 remains Main Street, {{acting as the}} primary eastwest road through town. It crosses two railroad lines, the Buffalo Line that {{is owned by the}} Norfolk Southern Railway and operated by the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad and the Arcade and Attica Railroad (ARA), by way of two grade crossings immediately after entering the village. The route continues on through the lightly developed western half of Arcade, crossing the ARA a second time before both reach the more populated village <b>center.</b> <b>Here,</b> the railroad crosses NY39 a third and final time before connecting to NY98 at Liberty Street. That route overlaps with NY39 for a mere [...] east to Water Street, where NY98 resumes its northward trek toward Batavia.

But Putnam Hall stood up manfully, and Andy got the pigskin in a manner that {{elicited}} much applause. He carried it down the gridiron for eight yards and passed it over to Jack. Then, on the next down, Dale signaled for the trick play. Across the field came the ball and then back to <b>center.</b> <b>Here</b> a quick turn was made that bewildered the Dauntless eleven. On came the pigskin, and almost before anybody knew it, Jack kicked a goal from the field.|$|E
