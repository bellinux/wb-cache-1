40|$|Society is {{becoming}} increasingly {{more aware of the}} environmental consequences of agricultural production. Farmers today are under increasing pressure to adopt more sustainable farm management practices. One method to improve the sustainability of crop production is the use of <b>cover</b> <b>crops.</b> <b>Cover</b> <b>crops</b> are planted 2 ̆ 2 off-season 2 ̆ 2 to provide agronomic and environmental benefits. The objective of this research is to quantify the impacts of <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> and determine where and under which management practices <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> provide the greatest benefit. Management practices include different crop rotations, tillage practices and residue removal rates. This paper will focus on soil erosion, nitrate leaching and soil organic carbon. ^ To quantify the impact of <b>cover</b> <b>crops,</b> a dummy variable model was used to estimate the amount of soil erosion, nitrate leaching and soil organic carbon change for a combination of different management practices on soils with different land capability class ratings. Once the environmental outcomes have been determined, the benefits of <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> can be quantified. Data for the environmental outcomes are simulated by the Landscape Environmental Assessment Framework (LEAF). To determine if <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> are worth the cost, estimates for the price of soil erosion, nitrate leaching and soil organic carbon are combined with the environmental outcomes. ^ From this analysis we find that: (1) <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> improve environmental outcomes (2) reduced till benefits more from <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> than no till (3) continuous corn rotations benefits more from <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> than corn soybean rotations (4) soils with higher land capability class ratings benefit the most from <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> (5) <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> are needed to maintain positive soil organic carbon for medium residue harvest and high residue harvest (6) considering only the nutrient benefits of reduced soil erosion, reduced nitrate leaching and increased soil organic carbon rarely justifies the cost of <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> (7) for high residue harvest, the social benefits of <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> always exceed the cost. ...|$|R

25|$|Since AM fungi are biotrophic, {{they are}} {{dependent}} on plants {{for the growth of}} their hyphal networks. Growing a <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.|$|E

Later in maturity, leaflets are elongated. It has clusters of small purple flowers followed by fruits spiralled in 2 to 3 turns containing 10–20 seeds. Alfalfa is native to warmer temperate climates.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of fertilization and interseeding <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> on the growth of main crops and weeds and the stability of weed suppression over years and main crop species under four-year rotational organic farming. Two <b>cover</b> <b>crops,</b> winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), were interseeded in furrows of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), soybean (Glycine max Merr.) and maize (Zea mays L.) at 3 - 5 weeks after planting the main crops. The number and dry weight of weeds were measured at the maximum plant height stage of main crops and main crop yields were recorded at their physiological maturity. The light competition between main <b>crops,</b> <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> and weeds was analyzed by vertical community structure and vegetation cover ratio (VCR) of each crop. Since light competition of main <b>crops</b> with <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> and weeds was not severe, main crop yields were not suppressed significantly by either <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> or weeds. Weed growth was suppressed significantly by interseeding <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> through increasing the VCR of main <b>crops</b> plus <b>cover</b> <b>crops.</b> This weed suppression by interseeding <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> was stable to the main crop species in rotational cropping systems and to the various environmental conditions, because the <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> compensated the low VCR of main crops alone at early growth stage especially when main crop growth was depressed by unfavorable environmental conditions. In addition, input of compost and fermented organic fertilizer had positive effects on the main crop yield and weed suppression.
