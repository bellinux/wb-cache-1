5|$|The H2-receptor {{antagonist}} cimetidine causes {{an increase}} in the plasma concentration of metformin, by reducing clearance of metformin by the kidneys; both metformin and cimetidine are cleared from the body by tubular secretion, and both, particularly the cationic (positively charged) form of cimetidine, may compete for the same transport mechanism. A small double-blind, randomized study found the antibiotic <b>cephalexin</b> to also increase metformin concentrations by a similar mechanism; theoretically, other cationic medications may produce the same effect.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. <b>Cephalexin</b> or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E

25|$|Prevention is by hand washing, {{avoiding}} {{people who}} are infected, and cleaning injuries. Treatment is typically with antibiotic creams such as mupirocin or fusidic acid.

25|$|Cefalexin, also spelled <b>cephalexin,</b> is an {{antibiotic}} that can treat {{a number of}} bacterial infections. It kills gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria by disrupting {{the growth of the}} bacterial cell wall. Cefalexin is a beta-lactam antibiotic within the class of first-generation cephalosporins. It works similarly to other agents within this class, including intravenous cefazolin, but can be taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is {{typically}} with antibiotics taken by mouth, such as <b>cephalexin,</b> amoxicillin, or cloxacillin. In {{those who are}} seriously allergic to penicillin, erythromycin or clindamycin may be used. When methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a concern, doxycycline or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may, in addition, be recommended. Concern {{is related to the}} presence of pus or previous MRSA infections. Elevating the infected area may be useful, as may pain killers.|$|E
25|$|In {{those cases}} of abscess which do require {{antibiotic}} treatment, Staphylococcus aureus bacteria {{is a common}} cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as flucloxacillin or dicloxacillin is used. The Infectious Diseases Society of America advises that the draining of an abscess {{is not enough to}} address community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective. Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The American College of Emergency Physicians advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment. If the condition is thought to be cellulitis rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or <b>cephalexin</b> in patients able to tolerate penicillin. Antibiotic therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low pH levels.|$|E

In late 2013 she was declared Artist of the Year by MTV. On January 29, 2014, she played an acoustic concert show on MTV Unplugged, performing songs from Bangerz featuring a guest appearance by Madonna. It became the highest rated MTV Unplugged {{in the past decade}} with over 1.7 million streams. Cyrus was also featured in the Marc Jacobs spring 2014 ad campaign along with Natalie Westling and Esmerelda Seay Reynolds. She launched her controversial Bangerz Tour (2014) that year, which received a generally positive reception. During the tour, Cyrus suffered an allergic reaction to the antibiotic <b>cephalexin,</b> prescribed to treat a sinus infection, resulting in her hospitalization in Kansas City. Though some dates had to be rescheduled, the tour resumed days later.|$|E

A variety of antibiotics, including tetracycline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, fluoroquinolones, [...] metronidazole, neomycin, <b>cephalexin,</b> trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and nitazoxanide have been used; however, the best evidence is for the use of rifaximin.|$|E
2500|$|Nitrofurantoin is {{pregnancy}} category B. It {{is one of}} the few drugs {{commonly used}} in pregnancy to treat UTIs. Other drugs used for UTIs in pregnancy include <b>cephalexin,</b> amoxicillin, and pivmecillinam. The drug should not be given to women in late pregnancy due to the potential risk of hemolytic anemia in the newborn, as the newborn has not yet developed the enzymatic pathways necessary for glutathione metabolism and the drug may cause oxidative damage to the red blood cells. [...] Newborns of women given this drug late in pregnancy had a higher risk of developing neonatal jaundice.|$|E
2500|$|Cefalexin is a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic of the cephalosporin family. [...] It is bactericidal {{and acts}} by inhibiting {{synthesis of the}} peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall. As cefalexin closely resembles d-alanyl-d-alanine, an amino acid ending on the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, {{it is able to}} irreversibly bind to the active site of PBP, which is essential for the synthesis of the cell wall. It is most active against gram-positive cocci, and has moderate activity against some gram-negative bacilli. However, some bacterial cells have the enzyme β-lactamase, which hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring, rendering the drug inactive. This contributes to antibacterial resistance towards <b>cephalexin.</b>|$|E
