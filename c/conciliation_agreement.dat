The outcome of its innovative bank-led workout ('conciliation') process, documented {{in this study of}} 62 firms, is decidedly mixed. The EBRP forced banks to confront their problems, helped them to build instituional capacity in their workout units, and furthered the difficult task of weeding out and closing clearly unviable firms. Yet it had limited power to promote needed restructuring or privatization in firms. The <b>conciliation</b> <b>agreements</b> were relatively unsophisticated and include few tangible requirements for operational or management change. The first two years of implementation saw a slowdown (over earlier years) in the rate of layoffs, a decline in average operating profitablility, and very little real privatization.

Due to a concerted effort, the EEOC reduced the pending inventory of private sector charges by 10 percent from fiscal year 2011, bringing the inventory level to 70,312. This inventory reduction is the second consecutive decrease of almost ten percent in charge inventory. Also this fiscal year, the agency obtained the largest amount of monetary recovery from private sector and state and local government employers through its administrative process — $365.4 million. In fiscal year 2012, the EEOC filed 122 lawsuits, including 86 individual suits, 26 multiple-victim suits, with fewer than 20 victims, and 10 systemic suits. The EEOC's legal staff resolved 254 lawsuits for a total monetary recovery of $44.2 million. [...] EEOC also continued its emphasis on eliminating alleged systemic patterns of discrimination in the workplace. In fiscal year 2012, EEOC completed 240 systemic investigations which in part resulted in 46 settlements or <b>conciliation</b> <b>agreements.</b> These settlements, achieved without litigation, secured 36.2 million dollars for the victims of unlawful discrimination.

It specifically develops and tests a theory of unilateral initiatives derived from Osgood 2 ̆ 7 s (1962) notion of Graduated and Reciprocated Initiatives in Tension Reduction (GRIT). The major propositions of the theory indicate that, given a pattern of mutual resistance or hostility, unilateral initiatives and tit-for-tat retaliation in response to punitive action will produce more conciliation and less hostility by an opponent. To test the theory, a bargaining setting was created in a laboratory experiment in which parties exchanged offers and counteroffers on an issue across a number of rounds while also having the option to engage in punitive action against one another. The results indicated that (1) unilateral initiatives produced more concession making and less hostility than a reciprocity strategy, and (2) tit-for-tat retaliation heightened hostility initially but reduced it over time. The article suggests some general, abstract conditions under which two parties in conflict can produce <b>conciliation</b> and reach <b>agreements</b> without the intervention of third parties...|$|R

40|$|This article {{advances}} a new {{conception of}} labour {{history as the}} history of industrial relations, understood broadly as the changing relationships between workers, trade unions, employers and the state. The {{first half of the}} paper examines the major interpretative traditions in British labour history, from the Webbs and the 'Oxford School' to the postwar social historians and the 'rank-and-filists'. It shows that despite their many differences, both institutionalists and social historians explain the development of labour institutions by reference to the objective interests of social groups, and goes on to raise some theoretical objections to this form of explanation. The second half of the paper draws on the findings of recent research on the history of work and industrial relations in late nineteenth and twentieth century Britain to argue that relationships between workers and employers were shaped less by informal groups or spontaneous social and economical processes than by institutional forces: by organizations such as trade unions, shop stewards' committees, business enterprises, employers' associations and the state; and by the rules and procedures governing their interaction such as collective <b>agreements,</b> <b>conciliation</b> and arbitration boards, wages councils and legislati.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. As part of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) 1998 Survey of Employment Tribunal Applications (SETA 98 - held at the UK Data Archive under SN: 4894), a supplementary 'spin-out' survey of professional advisors/representatives was undertaken, thereby providing an opportunity to consider first-hand the views of practitioners. Key issues in the Survey of Representatives (SOR 98) were: to examine the role of these external advisors; their influence {{on the outcome of}} the case; and their relationship with Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) conciliators. SOR 98 was a supplementary component of the main SETA 98 study. The survey was administered (by computer assisted telephone interviewing) in cases where the main jurisdiction was either unfair dismissal, breach of contract, or Wages Act, and where the main survey participant either took advice or used external representation and also gave permission for their representative to be approached. Both the main survey and SOR 98 were conducted by Social and Community Planning Research (SCPR – now the National Centre for Social Research). Sampling resulted in 452 productive interviews, 305 with applicant representatives and 147 with employer representatives (constituting a response rate of 70 per cent of cases deemed eligible). Representatives were found to be influential in determining case outcomes through their role in advising clients on case merits and courses of action. The data provide evidence of the efforts made by ACAS conciliation officers to promote settlement, and their skill in remaining impartial and securing the trust of representatives. High levels of satisfaction were reported both with the Employment Tribunal system and its agents or agencies. Main Topics : In total the data contains 305 productive interviews with applicants and 143 interviews with employers. These cases can be linked to information on the applicant or employer respondent in the main SETA 98 study (see under SN: 4894). Topics covered included background to the dispute, outcome, cash settlements, tribunal orders, employer representation, advisor/representative characteristics, advice given, ACAS individual <b>conciliation</b> officers, compromise <b>agreements,</b> representation on opposing side, satisfaction with ACAS/Employment Tribunal Services (ETS), full tribunal hearings and other issues. Unfortunately several problems with the programming of the computer assisted telephone interviewing software (Blaise) used to collect the data has meant that information is not always of a quality which might be hoped for in such a study. In general however, these problems relate to a small number of variables and cases. Information on the caveats {{can be found in the}} supporting documentation. Users are advised to read the documentation very carefully before using these data. <br...|$|R

The study is conducted {{from the perspective of the}} enterprises implementing BCAs with debt /equity swaps and regular BCAs using data from surveys conducted by the authors during 1994 to 1995. Results of the analysis suggest that bank conciliation agreements did not protect creditors and sometimes supported bad firms at the cost of good ones. However, there are also positive aspects of the restructuring programme including: the improved supervision and control of the banks and creditors over enterprises, banks being mobilised to restructure their bad debt portfolios which provided an impulse for the internal modernisation of bank structures. The BCA also encouraged the emergence of investment banking dealing both with equity investments and co-participation in the management of privatised firms. ...|$|E
40|$|The central {{question}} {{of this research}} is how to conceptualise more rigorously the processes of 'networked expertise' whereby scientists from different backgrounds are brought together to share their knowledge, in order to design innovative products and services. The study focuses on the coordination of collaborative expert teams, a growing issue in both the ongoing debate about the nature ofprofessionalism and the literature on innovation and economic development. The research was based on a longitudinal case study where ethnographic methods were used to document at a micro-genetic level the development of the practices of a multi-. professional research collaboration in the conte'St of the e-Science Programme in the UK. The scientific importance of the study lies in the choice of topic, the methodology @ employed, the context studied, and a synthesis of the literature on expertise from psychology and educational studies to organisational theory and innovation research. Critically engaging with Sociocultural Activity Theory, the main contribution of this research lies in characterising this form of collaborative working as a process of knowledge co-configuration between experts. The term is coined to capture the struggle and identity negotiations involved in knowledge sharing interactions between experts from different institutional backgrounds. This involved a process ofpractice development that enabled the collaborative team of experts to make the transition from uncreative to creative interaction. Engaging with three types of negotiation practices - articulation work, collaborative strategising and practice alignment - fostered the development of a practice platform necessary for knowledge co-configuration to occur. Identifying these three practices led to the theorisation of an emergent concept captured as 'balancing at the boundaries' between one's organisation and the new collaborative team, as an essential capacity that needs to be learned by actors to foster expert performance in this setting. Ultimately this thesis has been concerned with unravelling a paradox: the different experts are brought together to share their domain knowledge filtered through their experiences of work tasks; yet it is their situated understandings of work practices that become a major obstacle to moving the work forward in the collaborative team. The message, therefore, {{is that we need to}} move on from a conception of expertise as 'deliberative rationality' to a conception of expertise as purposeful relationality. Knowing when to act relationally, and when not, to foster productive work, is crucial, a further indication that this form of knowledge work is about engaging in a balancing act at organisational boundaries. Diplomatic Dispute Settlement - The Use of Conciliation and Analogous Methods Sven M. G. Koopmans, M. Jur. Magdalen College Oxford D. Phil. Trinity Term 2007 The diplomatic dispute settlement method of conciliation developed in the early 20 th century with the purpose of preventing wars, especially through settlement of 'political' or 'non-justiciable' disputes. Another rationale for conciliation was the avoidance of adjudication, by a method of assisted compromise. Nowadays it is thought that disputes are not incapable of judicial settlement because of a suppose~ inherent political or non-justiciable character. Further, a hundred years of conciliation has demonstrated that the method rarely prevents wars. Nevertheless, conciliation continues to be included in bilateral and multilateral agreements. It is occasionally used, often as a means to avoid adjudication. Types of conciliation must be distinguished. In the political type, conciliators recommend a settlement on political grounds. In law-based conciliation the commission provides a non-binding legal opinion. In mixed conciliation the conciliators make proposals based on a combination of legal and stipulated other grounds. Whereas conciliation originally was essentially political, in practice it was often law-based or mixed. This has had an effect on its use, and on the legal consequences of its application. Ã‚Â® The suitability of types of conciliation depends on the kind of dispute. In multilateral <b>agreements,</b> <b>conciliation</b> is frequently provided for as an alternative to compulsory adjudication. Aspects of law-based conciliation can then be introduced to promote that the norms of the regime are taken into account in finding a settlement. However, the alternative to conciliation, in the form of a non-compliance procedure, may in certain cases replace the use of conciliation. Inspiration for variations on conciliation can be found in commercial dispute settlement. However, the lack of practice of conciliation, combined with the many variations of existing conciliation mechanisms, indicates that the limited use made of conciliation is not a matter of available procedures, but of demand.

40|$|Prior to {{bringing}} suit {{on behalf of}} an employee, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission must follow specific procedural requirements and must engage in conciliation. The purpose of conciliation is for opposing parties to avoid the court system by encouraging out-of-court settlements. Employers {{in the majority of}} circuits can argue failure to conciliate as an affirmative defense when employers feel the Commission has failed its duty to conciliate. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit recently held that conciliation efforts are not judicially reviewable and as such cannot be raised as an affirmative defense. This Comment will explain why a minimal review of conciliation efforts is necessary, and Congress should amend Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”) to provide courts the power to sanction the Commission or an employer that does not engage in good faith in conciliation. A minimal review of conciliation efforts is the proper standard because it provides the Commission with deference to determine the appropriate <b>conciliation</b> <b>agreement</b> in the circumstances, but also provides an incentive for the parties to conciliate properly the first time. Furthermore, Congress should amend 42 U. S. C. § 2000 e- 5 (f) to provide that a party who has engaged in bad faith conciliation may have to pay the other party’s attorney’s fees or negotiation costs. A minimal review of conciliation procedures and a statutory amendment are the best way to ensure the statutory requirements are meaningfully followed...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper had}} been {{presented}} for promotion at the University of Khartoum. To {{get the full}} text please contact the other at babiker 69 @hotmail. com•	This paper mainly focuses on what the author calls ‘the judiciary of conciliation’ {{and the role of}} the Judiciary in settling disputes in accordance with Sharia Law and Sudanese statutory legislations. The author further highlights similar substantive laws and practices in other jurisdictions such as Egypt, Syria and France. •	The author has argued that conciliation is defined in Article 3 of the 1984 Sudanese Civil Transactions Act and it is main purpose is 'to settle or end a dispute or claims between two parties through consensus’. The author argues that this definition is derived from Hanafi religious school of thought as one of the sources of Sudanese legislations. The author in the Article addresses the elements of ‘conciliation’ which include the following: (a) consent; (b) the existence of a dispute or an expected dispute; (c) mutual concessions to be offered by both parties; (d) the intention or willingness of both parties to settle or end the dispute. The author further highlights the importance of ‘conciliation’ in reducing the burden of litigation on the parties to the dispute in terms of cost involved, effort and time as well as removing from courts huge burden to adjudicate cases. Above all, conciliation is also perceived as realizing justice, create societal peace and security. •	The author further examined the distinction between ‘conciliation’ and ‘pardoning’. The author has also addressed the issue of ‘conciliation’ in criminal cases arguing that ‘conciliation’ as a general rule is not permitted under Sharia law with regard to ‘hudud crimes’ while it is permitted in Qisas crimes. The author has also examined the practice of other jurisdictions such as Egypt, France and Syria where statutory laws in these countries recognize ‘conciliation’ and set up first instance courts or ‘conciliation councils’ to deal with disputes. As far as Sudan is concerned, the author has referred to judicial precedents regarding conciliation. He further argues that court judgements cannot even be subjected to appeals in higher courts according to article 155 of the Civil Procedures Act which prohibits appeals in cases where the parties to the dispute have agreed or consented to the decision reached as a result of ‘conciliation’. The author also argues that 'conciliation' is regarded as the ‘master of all judgements’. However, the High Court in some cases decided that the ‘conciliation’ judgement can be appealed if there are procedural or legal mistakes directly affecting the rights of the parties. •	Regarding the procedural aspects of conciliation in Sudanese laws the author argues that the 1984 Civil Procedures Act does not adequately address the required procedures for reaching consensus or conciliation. However, the case shall be referred to the Judge in order to reach conciliation. The Judge in this case may himself engage in the process of conciliation or delegate his powers. Also, Article 226 (1) of the 1984 Civil Procedures Act provides that at any time and before the court makes a final decision the parties the conflict may reach ‘conciliation’ or settlement outside court and this conciliation may be done inside or outside the court. Sudan’s legal system also recognizes two types of conciliations: (1) judicial conciliation which falls under the jurisdiction of the judicial Council; and (2) non-judicial conciliation which takes place outside the Judicial Council. Article 227 provides that before a court issues a verdict and due to the nature and circumstances of the case and the relationship of the parties to the dispute the court may invite the parties and advice them to reach ‘conciliation’. In this case, the court can issue an order to stop the claim and gives a deadline for the parties to reach a final agreement. •	Regarding the verification of conciliation in front of the court Article 228 (1) provides that once the parties reach conciliation before the court it shall be included and authorized as part of the court proceedings and hence endorsed by the parties to the dispute. The court can also endorse written <b>conciliation</b> <b>agreement</b> reached by the parties outside the court. The court however, shall verify that any <b>conciliation</b> <b>agreement</b> reached by the parties does not contradict the law or ‘good conduct’. Also, agreements reached outside the court under Article 228 (3) requires from the parties to inform the court so as to be formally endorsed and to be part of the legal claims. Article 228 (4) also provides that courts can stop the legal proceedings to enable the parties to reach conciliation within a specific timeframe to decided by the court. If the parties did not reach any conciliation the court will proceed an issue a verdict...|$|E
