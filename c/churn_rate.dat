25|$|Churn or Customer {{attrition}} {{is often}} used {{as an indicator of}} customer satisfaction. However the <b>churn</b> <b>rate</b> can be kept artificially low by making it difficult for the customers to resiliate their services. This can include ignoring resiliations requests, implementing lengthy and complicated resiliation procedures to follow through by an average consumer and various other barriers to resiliation. Thus, churn can improve while customer satisfaction deteriorates. This practice is short sighted and will backfire. However, it was shown to be common in telephone companies and among internet providers.|$|E

However, due to effects of dynamic IP address allocation, such counts tend to overestimate the number of hosts, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In the literature, the rate at which hosts change IP addresses is referred to as DHCP <b>churn.</b> <b>Churn</b> <b>rates</b> vary significantly within and among ISP networks, and such variation poses a challenge to any research that relies upon IP addresses as a metric. We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP <b>churn</b> <b>rates,</b> in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric.

5000|$|Churn {{is closely}} related to the concept of average {{customer}} life time. For example, an annual <b>churn</b> <b>rate</b> of 25 percent implies an average customer life of four years. An annual <b>churn</b> <b>rate</b> of 33 percent implies an average customer life of three years. The <b>churn</b> <b>rate</b> can be minimized by creating barriers which discourage customers to change suppliers (contractual binding periods, use of proprietary technology, value-added services, unique business models, etc.), or through retention activities such as loyalty programs. It is possible to overstate the <b>churn</b> <b>rate,</b> as when a consumer drops the service but then restarts it within the same year. Thus, a clear distinction needs to be made between [...] "gross churn", the total number of absolute disconnections, and [...] "net churn", the overall loss of subscribers or members. The difference between the two measures is the number of new subscribers or members that have joined during the same period. Suppliers may find that if they offer a loss-leader [...] "introductory special", it can lead to a higher <b>churn</b> <b>rate</b> and subscriber abuse, as some subscribers will sign on, let the service lapse, then sign on again to take continuous advantage of current specials.|$|E

On the other hand, it might be the case that the survey data just record the “relevant” churning. “Relevant” in the sense that it appears in the employer’s perception and therefore, enters the decision process. Nevertheless, the main result, i.e. a reduction in employment is above all achieved by a increase of separations.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{characterize}} the structure and the evolution of Finnish regional labour markets in terms of gross job and worker flows using plant-level data. There is no solid evidence that the job creation rate is on average lower in Eastern and Northern Finland. The rapid rise in regional unemployment disparities in the 1990 s can be explained via the rise in the disparities in job destruction rates across regions during the great depression of the 1990 s. There are some interesting differences in the adjustment of labour demand during the great depression of the early 1990 s. For example, the results indicate that the magnitude of structural change measured by the <b>churning</b> <b>rate</b> (i. e. excess worker reallocation) is especially high in Uusimaa. This suggests that the intensity of structural change is high in Uusimaa, where the unemployment rate has been lower than in Finland on average. Kainuu has the lowest level of the <b>churning</b> <b>rate,</b> where the unemployment rate has been highest during the past few decades. Thus, the results suggest that the most important structural features that explain the high unemployment rate of Kainuu is the fact that the structural change within plants does not revitalize the economic activities of the region enough.
