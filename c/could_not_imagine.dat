5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{features}} the first {{appearance of the}} bowling alley Barney's Bowlarama. The original backstory for Barney's Bowlarama {{was that it was}} owned by Barney Gumble. Over time it changed to Barney just being an employee, as the writers <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> Barney owning anything. It was later revealed that Barney's uncle was the owner. The exterior of the Bowlarama was designed by No Doubt member Eric Stefani. The episode also marks the first appearances of Lenny Leonard and Helen Lovejoy.|$|E

5|$|Considering the ICBM problem, {{the study}} {{went on to}} suggest that the system would have to be {{effective}} between 95 and 100% of the time in order to be worthwhile. They considered attacks against the RV while the missile was in the midcourse, just as it reached the highest point in its trajectory and was traveling at its slowest speed. Practical limitations eliminated this possibility, as it required the ABM to be launched {{at about the same time}} as the ICBM in order to meet in the middle, and they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> a way to arrange this. Working at much shorter ranges, during the terminal phase, seemed the only possible solution.|$|E
5|$|Rama Rao's son {{and actor}} Nandamuri Balakrishna {{announced}} Nartanasala remake in 2004. Apart from directing the remake, Balakrishna played a dual {{role in the}} remakethose of Arjuna and Kichaka. Soundarya was signed to play Draupadi with Srihari, Sarath Babu, Uday Kiran and Asin cast in supporting roles. The remake's principal photography commenced on 1 March 2004. The remake was shelved later due {{to the death of}} Soundarya in an accident. In an interview with The Times of India in August 2014, Balakrishna said that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> anyone other than Soundarya for the character and after her death, he called off the film with no intention to revive it.|$|E

Żurawski's company last contacted Urban between 15:00 and 16:00, when Urban {{reported that he had}} arrived a day early to the Berlin warehouse and that he had to wait there overnight to unload his truck the following morning. The last photo of Urban still alive was taken at a kebab shop near the ThyssenKrupp warehouse at about 14:00.|$|E

500|$|Caracciola {{first met}} Adolf Hitler, {{the leader of}} the Nazi Party, in 1931. Hitler had ordered a Mercedes-Benz 770, at that point Mercedes' most {{expensive}} car, but due to {{the amount of time spent}} upgrading the car in line with the Nazi leader's wishes, the delivery was late. To mollify Hitler's anger, Caracciola was dispatched by Mercedes to deliver the car to the Brown House in Munich. Caracciola drove Hitler and his niece Geli Raubal around Munich to demonstrate the car. He later wrote (after the fall of the Nazi Party) that he was not particularly awed by Hitler: [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> that this man would have the requirements for taking over the government someday." ...|$|E
500|$|Heisman {{recalled}} that, when Strupper {{first arrived}} from Riverside Military Academy, Heisman <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> Strupper {{playing on the}} football team: [...] "Too light for the line, I didn't see how he could play in the backfield, because he wouldn't {{be able to get}} the signals. He could have played quarterback fine, but his enunciation wasn't clear enough for him to call the plays." [...] Heisman recalled how Strupper overcame the obstacle posed by his deafness: [...] "He couldn't hear anything but a regular shout. But he could read your lips like a flash. No lad that ever stepped on a football field had keener eyes than Everett had. The enemy found this out the minute he began looking for openings through which to run the ball." [...] He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1869–1919 era team.|$|E

[...] "As a lawyer, I'm all for its review but on whether it should be scrapped, I don't know. You've got a multi-racial society [...] in which emotions can run high very quickly." [...] Interviewed on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio programme PM in April 2001, Hickling agreed with the interviewer, Geoff Thompson, that he supported the law's continued existence and said he was [...] "sorry to say that, in the light of my own experience, I'm inclined to think you couldn't really safely get rid of it at the moment".

500|$|Manson {{began his}} {{long-term}} collaboration with Austrian-Irish artist Gottfried Helnwein in May 2002, collaborating on several projects {{associated with the}} album. In addition to the album artwork, the pair created large-scale multi-media installation art pieces that {{would go on to}} be exhibited in various galleries throughout Europe and the United States. These were also displayed at the album's launch party at The Key Club in Los Angeles. They also worked together on the music video to lead single [...] "Mobscene" [...] (stylized as [...] "mOBSCENE"), as well as images which accompanied Manson's essay for The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Helnwein later expressed disappointment that the latter was not selected as the album cover. Many of the images found in the album artwork were inspired by illustrations found in Mel Gordon's 2000 book Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin. Concerned that Gordon might take issue with use of the book's material, Manson called Gordon, who said he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> a greater compliment than a popular music album based on an academic book. The Golden Age of Grotesque was also the title of Manson's first art exhibition, which took place in September 2002 at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions Center.|$|E
500|$|By 1964, {{the country}} was a {{constitutional}} monarchy ruled by Sultan Jamshid bin Abdullah. Zanzibar had a population of around 230,000 Africans—some of whom claimed Persian ancestry and were known locally as Shirazis—and also contained significant minorities in the 50,000 Arabs and 20,000 South Asians who were prominent in business and trade. The various ethnic groups were becoming mixed and the distinctions between them had blurred; according to one historian, an important reason for the general support for Sultan Carbou was his family's ethnic diversity. However, the island's Arab inhabitants, as the major landowners, were generally wealthier than the Africans; the major political parties were organised largely along ethnic lines, [...] with Arabs dominating the Zanzibar Nationalist Party (ZNP) and Africans the Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP). The ZNP looked towards Egypt as its model, which caused some tensions with the British colonial officials, but Zanzibar had been for centuries dominated by its Arab elite, and the Colonial Office <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> a Zanzibar ruled by the blacks. After Zanzibar had been conquered by the Sultanate of Oman in 1698, all {{of the land in}} the countryside had been given to Omani aristocratic families, whose descendants still owned the land in 1964. Though not all of the Arabs were as wealthy as the families who owned the clove and coconut plantations, the resentment felt by the poor African farmers who worked the plantations acquired a racialized tinge, especially as in a small island like Zanzibar, {{it was easy to see}} the contrast in wealth between the land-owning Arab families and their poor African tenants.|$|E
