5|$|A {{folklore}} {{story is}} {{also associated with}} Sakurai Genbei, who was Ikeda Terumasa's master carpenter {{in the construction of}} the keep. According to the legend, Sakurai was dissatisfied with his construction, feeling that the keep leaned a little to the southeast. Eventually, he became distraught and climbed to the top of the keep, where he jumped to his death with a <b>chisel</b> in his mouth.|$|E

5|$|Another very ancient seat is the {{so-called}} “Chair of Dagobert” in the Louvre. It is of cast bronze, sharpened with the <b>chisel</b> and partially gilt; it is of the curule or faldstool type and supported upon legs terminating in the heads and feet of animals. The seat, which was probably of leather, has disappeared. Its attribution depends entirely upon the statement of Suger, abbot of St Denis in the 12th century, who added a back and arms. Its age has been much discussed, but Viollet-le-Duc dated it to early Merovingian times, and it may in any case be taken as the oldest faldstool in existence.|$|E
5|$|By the Early Dynastic Period in {{the late}} 4th {{millennium}} BC, Egyptian hieroglyphs and their cursive form hieratic were well-established written scripts. Egyptian hieroglyphs are small artistic pictures of natural objects. For example, the hieroglyph for door-bolt, pronounced se, produced the s sound; when this hieroglyph was combined with another or multiple hieroglyphs, it produced a combination of sounds that could represent abstract concepts like sorrow, happiness, beauty, and evil. The Narmer Palette, dated c. 3100 BC during the last phase of Predynastic Egypt, combines the hieroglyphs for catfish and <b>chisel</b> to produce the name of King Narmer.|$|E
5|$|Paul Kelly {{stayed with}} Don Walker (Cold <b>Chisel)</b> in Kings Cross – Walker {{had lived with}} Hilary's sister – and wrote new songs on Walker's piano. Kelly then moved into a flat with Paul Hewson (Dragon) in Elizabeth Bay. Both Walker and Hewson {{encouraged}} Kelly to continue with his song-writing. By January 1985, he recorded the self-funded album—at a cost of $3,500—Post. Session musicians included Michael Barclay (Weddings Parties Anything) on harmonies, guitarist Steve Connolly (The Zimmermen), and bass guitarist Ian Rilen (Rose Tattoo, X). They spent two weeks recording at Clive Shakespeare's studio. Shakespeare engineered the album and co-produced with Kelly. It was released in May 1985 on the independent label White Records, and licensed to Mushroom Records.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Mechanical {{harvesting}} {{has increasingly}} {{been used in}} sugarcane production units, and it has often resulted in reduced structural quality of the soil due to soil compaction caused by machine traffic. Thus, sugarcane ratoon crops have often been <b>chiseled</b> to overcome such a problem. The aim {{of the current study}} is to assess some physical properties of a Latossolo Vermelho Distroférrico (Rhodic Hapludox) that was <b>chiseled</b> after the third harvest in a sugarcane ratoon crop. The study was conducted in a commercial crop area throughout the 2011 / 2012 crop year. A randomized block experimental design was used, with five replications. The treatments consisted of five <b>chiseling</b> operations in sugarcane ratoon crops, namely: T 1 - single-shank ripper with <b>chiseling</b> to a depth of 0. 15 m; T 2 - single-shank ripper with <b>chiseling</b> to a depth of 0. 30 m; T 3 - two-bar ripper with <b>chiseling</b> to a depth of 0. 15 m, T 4 - two-bar ripper with <b>chiseling</b> to a depth of 0. 30 m; and T 5 - control group, with no <b>chiseling.</b> Overall, soil <b>chiseling</b> is effective for improving the physical quality of the soil to a depth of 0. 15 m, regardless of the equipment and the depth. Two-bar-ripper-based soil <b>chiseling</b> to a depth of 0. 30 m provides increased sugarcane yield...|$|R

5|$|A {{thorough}} stylistic {{analysis of}} the ornamentation of the monument, in particular of the figures within the circles of the Battle scene and the Scene of sacrifice reveal a surprising sensitivity to bronze {{on the part of}} Cairano, and considerable scope for reinterpretation and commingling of styles. This stemmed from a sensible response to {{the context in which the}} mausoleum was designed and implemented. Unprecedented in Brescia was the combination of bronze and stone, the former under the supervision of Bernardino delle Croci who certainly had a vast catalogue of references to ancient and contemporary works, all of which are cited in the major and minor rounds on the base. It is difficult to exclude Cairano from the influence of so much classicism, but the sole Scene of sacrifice attests to the sophistication of his <b>chisel</b> and the innovative combination of sculpture and bronzes around 1510, to which date much of the remaining lapidary apparatus can also be placed.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{travels to}} Provo, Utah to meet Calvin Smith (Michael O'Neill), the {{prosecutor}} in a local murder case; and Didi Higgens (Sarah Koskoff), a pathologist for the County Medical Examiner's office. Smith and Higgens {{have been involved in}} the trial of former sheriff William Garry (John Finn), who has been convicted of killing his three children and wife. Garry pleaded guilty to murders, and forensic evidence has linked him to a wood-carving <b>chisel</b> used to commit the murders. Black has been asked to construct an offender profile for Garry, to determine whether the man is sufficiently dangerous to society for a judge to issue a death penalty. Garry himself is asking to be executed.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp incisors. These incisors have thick layers of enamel {{on the front and}} little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a <b>chisel.</b> Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.|$|E

50|$|Alta's rock carvings were {{probably}} created using quartzite <b>chisels</b> that {{were probably}} driven by hammers made from some harder rocks; probable examples of <b>chisels</b> {{have been found}} throughout the area and are on display in Alta Museum.

5|$|The palace {{building}} {{consists of}} four floors built with timber, mud bricks, clay, and soil mortar. A carved wooden gate that Yabgo Raja Hatim Khan took from a fort in Skardu after conquering most of the Baltistan was erected {{at the entrance of}} the palace. The passage beyond the main gate, which formerly housed a stable, leads to the front lawn of the palace, which was used by the musical band during festivities in the reign of Yabgo Rajas. The wooden ceiling of the palace is crafted with designs using <b>chisel</b> and paint, without the use of nail. A hall at the top floor that was used as a leisure room overlooks the Karakoram mountain range and the lawns around the palace. Other notable rooms of the palace include the Royal meeting room (Chogoraftal), Royal balcony (Chogojarokh), Princess dressing room (Lainakhang), and Queen room.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{literature}} was produced {{on a variety}} of media. Along with the <b>chisel,</b> necessary for making inscriptions on stone, the chief writing tool of ancient Egypt was the reed pen, a reed fashioned into a stem with a bruised, brush-like end. With pigments of carbon black and red ochre, the reed pen was used to write on scrolls of papyrus—a thin material made from beating together strips of pith from the Cyperus papyrus plant—as well as on small ceramic or limestone ostraca known as potsherds. It is thought that papyrus rolls were moderately expensive commercial items, since many are palimpsests, manuscripts that have their original contents erased to make room for new written works. This, alongside tearing off pieces of papyrus documents to make smaller letters, suggests that there were seasonal shortages caused by the limited growing season of Cyperus papyrus. It also explains the frequent use of ostraca and limestone flakes as writing media for shorter written works. In addition to stone, ceramic ostraca, and papyrus, writing media also included wood, ivory, and plaster.|$|E
5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a <b>chisel</b> at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E

5|$|Japanese sources universally {{give the}} date for Kongōs keel-laying as 24 September 1875the {{same as that}} for the {{awarding}} of the contractbut historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable, arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. Kongō was launched on 17 April 1877; {{the wife of a}} secretary in the Japanese Legation cut the retaining rope with a hammer and <b>chisel.</b> Completed in January 1878, Kongō sailed for Japan on 18 February under the command of a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. She arrived in Yokohama on 26 April and was classified as a Third Class Warship on 4 May. On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for the receipt of the ship that was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials. The ship was opened for tours by the nobility, their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony. On 14 July, the general public was allowed to tour the ship for a week.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2000, {{the part}} of the {{radiation}} therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. They took it home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless steel casing), which was the unit's source drawer. Using a hammer and <b>chisel,</b> they only managed to crack the welded seam. Two of the men then took the metal piece, along with other scrap metal, to a scrapyard on Soi Wat Mahawong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province. There they asked a worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an oxyacetylene torch. As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard, but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly.|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{construction}} has several stages, including making and shaping of the drum body (or shell), preparing the drum skin, and tuning {{the skin to}} the drumhead. Variations in the construction process often occur in the latter two parts of this process. Historically, byō-uchi-daiko were crafted from trunks of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent splitting. A master carpenter then carved out the rough shape of the drum body with a chisel; {{the texture of the}} wood after carving softened the tone of the drum. In contemporary times, taiko are carved out on a large lathe using wood staves or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes. Drumheads can be left to air-dry over a period of years, but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the drying process. After drying is complete, the inside of the drum is worked with a deep-grooved <b>chisel</b> and sanded. Lastly, handles are placed onto the drum. These are used to carry smaller drums and they serve an ornamental purpose for larger drums.|$|E
40|$|Mechanical <b>chiseling</b> {{has been}} used to {{alleviate}} the effects of compaction in soils under no-tillage (NT). However, its effect on the soil physical properties {{does not seem to have}} a defined duration period. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the behavior of the bulk density (BD) and degree of compaction (DC) at different soil depths, after <b>chiseling</b> in no-tillage, for one year. The experiment was performed in Ponta Grossa, Paraná State, Brazil, using an Oxisol (Rhodic Hapludox). Bulk density and DC were previously measured in an area under NT for 16 years, then immediately after <b>chiseling</b> (CHI) in May 2009, six months after <b>chiseling</b> (CHI 6 M) in October 2009 and one year after <b>chiseling</b> (CHI 12 M) in May 2010. In the layers 0. 0 - 0. 10, 0. 10 - 0. 20 and 0. 20 - 0. 30 m, there was a significant BD reduction CHI and a marked increase CHI 6 M. The BD values measured CHI 12 M were similar to those before tillage. <b>Chiseling</b> reduced the DC in the layers 0. 0 - 0. 10 m and 0. 10 - 0. 20 m, but returned to the initial values one year later. During the evaluation periods CHI, CHI 6 M and CHI 12 M, the BD increased in the layer 0. 30 - 0. 40 m, compared with NT. The highest DC values were observed six months after chiseling; nevertheless the structural recovery of the soil was considerable, possibly due to the high degree of soil resilience and the influence of the wetting and drying cycles detected in the study period. The <b>chiseling</b> effects, evaluated by BD and DC, lasted less than one year, i. e., the beneficial short-term effects of <b>chiseling</b> on the reduction of the surface BD increased the risk of compaction in deeper soil layers...|$|R

5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} eats mainly insects, particularly caterpillar and beetles. In autumn and winter, {{the diet}} is supplemented with nuts and seeds, hazel nuts and beech mast being preferred. The young are fed {{mainly on the}} insects favoured by their parents, with some seeds. Food items are found mainly on tree trunks and large branches, but smaller branches may also be investigated, and food may be taken from the ground, especially outside the breeding season. Nuthatches can forage when descending trees head first, as well as when climbing. Some prey is caught in flight, and a nuthatch will remove bark or rotten wood to reach insects, although it cannot <b>chisel</b> into healthy wood like a woodpecker. A pair may temporarily join a mixed-species foraging flock as it passes near their territory. The Eurasian nuthatch readily visits bird tables and bird feeders in winter, eating human-made food items such as fat, cheese, butter and bread. It has even been recorded as taking slaughterhouse offal. Sizeable hard food items like nuts or large insects are wedged into crevices in tree bark and smashed with the strong bill.|$|E
5|$|The marble was quarried from Mt. Pentelikon {{and transported}} 19km to the acropolis of Athens. A {{persistent}} {{question has been}} whether it was carved in situ. Just below the moulding and above the tenia there is a channel 17mm high that would have served to give access to the sculptor's <b>chisel</b> when finishing the heads or feet on the relief; this scamillus or guide strip is the best evidence there is that the blocks were carved on the wall. Additionally, on practical grounds {{it is easier to}} move a sculptor than a sculpture, and to use a crowbar to put them into place, potentially, could have chipped the edges. No information is recoverable on the workshop, but estimates range from three to 80 sculptors on the basis of style, however, Jenifer Neils suggests nine, on the grounds that this would be the least number necessary to produce the work in the time given. It was finished with metal detailing and painted. No colour, however, survives, but perhaps the background was blue, judging by comparison with grave stelae and the paint remnants on the frieze of the Hephaisteion. Possibly figures held objects that were also rendered in paint such as Poseidon’s trident and the laurel in Apollo’s hand. The many drill holes found in Hera’s and Apollo's heads indicate that a gilded bronze wreath would probably have crowned the deities.|$|E
