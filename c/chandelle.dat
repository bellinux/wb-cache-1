The route comes to an {{intersection}} with the eastern terminus of DE 8 as it leaves Little Creek and becomes Bayside Drive again. The road continues northwest through farmland with some trees and homes, passing to the southwest of Octagonal Schoolhouse before heading through the community of Cowgills Corner. Past this intersection, the route runs southwest of <b>Chandelle</b> Estates Airport. DE 9 curves {{to the north and}} enters the town of Leipsic. At this point, the route turns northwest onto Denny Street and runs past homes and businesses, curving north to intersect the eastern terminus of DE 42.|$|E
25|$|In the 13.2m configuration, the SZD-59 is {{certified}} for unlimited aerobatics, whereas {{with the}} 15m wing-tips only basic aerobatic maneuvers (looping, turn, <b>chandelle,</b> spin) are permitted.|$|E
25|$|During {{his short}} flights, Corrigan {{performed}} aerobatic stunts. His favourite maneuver was the <b>chandelle,</b> in strings {{of up to}} a dozen, spiralling from close to the ground. The company disapproved and prohibited him from performing stunts in the company aircraft. Corrigan simply flew to a field further south where his stunts could not be seen by his employers.|$|E

500|$|While {{his plane}} was being reloaded with the [...]50 cal, {{a flight of}} dive bombers began {{strafing}} Wheeler. Welch took off again (since he had landed {{a few minutes before}} Taylor and was already reloaded). The men who were loading the ammunition on Taylor's plane left the ammunition boxes on his wing as they scattered {{to get away from the}} bombers. Taylor quickly took off, jumping over an armament dolly and the ammunition boxes fell off of his plane's wing. Both pilots realized that if they took off away from the incoming aircraft they would become targets once they were airborne, so both headed directly towards the bombers at take-off. Additionally, if the low-flying bombers attempted to fire at the grounded P-40s at their current elevation, they would risk crashing. Taylor used this hindrance to his advantage and began immediately firing on the Japanese aircraft as he took off, and performed a <b>chandelle.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} dogfight over England on 24 August 1940, Marseille was {{involved}} in a four-minute battle with a skilled opponent. He defeated his opponent by pulling up into a tight <b>chandelle,</b> to gain an altitude advantage before diving and firing. The British fighter was struck in the engine, pitching over and diving into the English Channel; this was Marseille's first victory. Marseille was then engaged from above by more Allied fighters. By pushing his aircraft into a steep dive then pulling up metres above the water, Marseille escaped from the machine gun fire of his opponents: [...] "skipping away over the waves, I made a clean break. No one followed me and I returned to Leeuwarden [...]" [...] The act was not praised by his unit. Marseille was reprimanded when it emerged he had abandoned his wingman, and staffel to engage the opponent alone. In so doing, Marseille had violated a basic rule of air combat. Marseille did not take any pleasure in this victory and found it difficult to accept the realities of aerial combat.|$|E
500|$|In The Shadow of the Templars, American George Stobbart, who is touring Europe, is {{a witness}} and {{victim of a}} bomb attack on a Parisian café [...] "La <b>Chandelle</b> Verte", caused by a clown, later {{revealed}} to be a serial killer named Khan, who steals an old man's briefcase and then sets off a bomb inside the café. Shortly after, he meets a French photo-journalist, Nicole [...] "Nico" [...] Collard, a resident of Rue Jarry in Paris, with whom he tries to discover {{who is responsible for}} the murder of the old man, Plantard, and while doing so, end up unraveling a conspiracy relating to the Knights Templar. The third and fourth game, The Sleeping Dragon and The Angel of Death, also follow the Templar-related story line: The Sleeping Dragon continuing the story from The Shadow of the Templars with a number of returning characters, while in The Angel of Death, George and Nico, with a newly introduced character Anna-Maria, unravel a mystery related to the Catholic Church. Unlike the other installments, in The Smoking Mirror, George and Nico unravel a Mayan mystery, involving the Mayan god Tezcatlipoca. The Serpent's Curse follows a storyline related to the Gnostic Gospels.|$|E

6000|$|The Hindus I {{believe to}} have been the first who symbolised by an {{equilateral}} triangle their peculiar cult, the Yoni-Linga: in their temple architecture, it became either a conoid or a perfect pyramid. Egypt denoted it by the obelisk, peculiar to that country; and the form appeared {{in different parts of the}} world: thus in England it was a mere upright stone, and in Ireland a round tower. This we might expect to see. D'Hancarville and Brotier have successfully traced the worship itself, in its different modifications, to all people: the symbol would therefore be found everywhere. The old Arab minaret is a plain cylindrical or polygonal tower, without balcony or stages, widely different from the Turkish, modern Egyptian, and Hijazi combinations of tube and prism, happily compared by a French traveller to [...] "une <b>chandelle</b> coiffee d'un eteignoir." [...] And finally the ancient minaret, made solid as all Gothic architecture is, and provided with a belfry, became the spire and steeple of our ancestors.|$|E

50|$|The <b>chandelle</b> is an {{aircraft}} control maneuver where the pilot combines a 180° turn with a climb.|$|E
50|$|The Corinthian {{column is}} almost always fluted. If it is not, it is often worth pausing to unravel the reason why ({{sometimes}} simply a tight budget). Even the flutes of a Corinthian column may be enriched. They may be filleted, with rods nestled within the hollow flutes, or stop-fluted, with the rods rising {{a third of the}} way, to where the entasis begins. The French like to call these <b>chandelles</b> and sometimes they end them literally with carved wisps of flame, or with bellflowers. Alternatively, beading or chains of husks may take the place of the fillets in the fluting, for Corinthian is the most playful and flexible of the orders. Its atmosphere is rich and festive, with more opportunities for variation than the other orders.|$|R
5000|$|The wingover is an energy-management maneuver. It {{is often}} used in dogfighting as an {{alternative}} to the split-s, when a fast turn-around is needed but a loss in altitude and a change in airspeed is not. Because the aircraft does not roll, it also has the advantage of keeping the cockpit facing the same direction during the turn, allowing the pilot to maintain sight of the opponent. Wingover-type maneuvers are often used to abruptly end other climbing maneuvers, like <b>chandelles</b> and high Yo-Yos, [...] "kicking over" [...] the nose when the enemy shows signs of falling or trying to dive away. One such maneuver was described by Major Robert S. Johnson, in an account of a battle during World War II: ...|$|R
50|$|In 2003 Service Bulletin 315-64/2 {{reduced the}} maximum {{admissible}} airspeeds and prohibited aerobatic flight. This {{was due to}} reports that {{the design of the}} fuselage may not have been sufficient to sustain limit loads during certain maneuvers and during flight at certain speeds. Grob completed further investigations into the effects of certain flight conditions on the fuselage structure and the development of corrective procedures. Further static strength tests were conducted to verify the safety margin of the fuselage. The results of these tests restored the original flight speed limitations and maneuver operations for the Twin II and allowed the Twin II Acro only basic aerobatic maneuvers (spins, lazy eights, <b>chandelles,</b> stall turns, steep turns, and positive loops). An approved modification, when incorporated, restores full acrobatic status to these sailplanes.|$|R
