500|$|... 2006: Honored with {{a star on}} the Hollywood Walk of Fame on October 16; {{located at}} 6915 Hollywood Boulevard {{and it was the}} 2,321st star awarded in its history; at the reception, he stated, [...] "I used to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> look at these stars and I could never quite figure out what you were {{supposed}} to do to get one...time has passed and now here I am doing this, and I'm still excited. I'm still excited to be an actor." ...|$|E
500|$|Afterward, Johnson began celebrating {{his fifth}} {{consecutive}} Sprint Cup Series championship. During the celebration, Johnson's crew chief, Chad Knaus commented, [...] "I think finally, finally after pulling this off Jimmie {{will get the}} respect that he deserves. Knowing {{what we had to}} do— <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> beat them— and we beat them." [...] Hamlin, the points leader before the race, described his disappointment by saying, [...] "I’m disappointed. Our car was lightning fast until that last wreck. When we hit the 16 (Biffle) that knocked the toe-in out. It wasn’t as fast after that. It’s just circumstances but we had a great year. We won the most races (8) and we contended like we have never contended before but circumstances took us out of this one. I don’t think the 48 (Johnson) showed the strength this year like they did in the past and that opened the door for the rest of us." [...] Harvick, who finished third in points, stated: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe {{they thought}} you would <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> wait for them and so changed their plans and went up the river instead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a lie. I've {{done a lot}} of clever work. But these infernal city girls <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> {{stirred up}} all the trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> I was afeard, and I went back; but I didn't like {{to speak}} to her, because of the gentleman, and I came on here again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And did {{you have}} all that in your mind, papa, when you <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> was that what you and Mr. Dawson wanted to talk about?" [...] said the {{astonished}} Rose.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Tom, every Friday I <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> call up all {{who have}} ill-used little {{children}} and serve {{them as they}} served the children." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, why didn't you?" [...] demanded Sam with {{a strong}} sense of injury. [...] "I might have forgiven you then. But to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> find you singing...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So foolish!" [...] she declared. [...] "He hasn't a {{shilling}} in the world, and {{he never}} wins anything. He {{might just as well}} have <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> made himself agreeable to Lois." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Charmond {{was a rich}} man, {{engaged in}} the iron trade in the north, twenty or thirty years older than she. He married her <b>and</b> retired, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> bought this property, as they do nowadays." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Women expect such {{a lot of}} letter-writing! But I {{have been}} remiss I know. I got out of my {{business}} {{way of doing things}} when I <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> have neglected it. Do you write to her to-morrow, and tell her that she shall hear from me directly I get back to town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} {{explained}} these young people. They're {{the sort of}} young people we are producing over here now in quite enormous quantity. They are the sort of equivalent of the Russian Intelligentsia, an irresponsible middle class with ideas. Teddy, you know, is my secretary. He's the son, I believe, of a Kilburn solicitor. He was recommended to me by Datcher of The Times. He <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> lived in lodgings for a time. Then suddenly appeared the young lady." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{all these}} things trouble me," [...] said he; [...] "for I feel I am sacrificing her for my own sin; and I think of her, and often <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> look at this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some day we {{want you}} to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> go out hunting with us," [...] said Jack. [...] "Can't you show us where we can get a chance at a deer, or {{something}} else that is worth while?" ...|$|E
6000|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. No; but {{you asked}} me to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> talk to you; and you {{mentioned}} casually that if I didnt youd have nobody to talk about me to but Bentley. That was a threat, was it not? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you don't}} know him, Auntie, but I {{hope you will}} soon. His name is Ralph Wylde. Isn't it pretty? I met him last winter, and we became very good friends. But we had a quarrel before I <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and,</b> oh, I have been so unhappy over it. Three weeks ago he wrote me and begged my pardon--so nice of him, because I was really all to blame, you know. And he said he loved me and--all that, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I found Graillot. I cornered him. I {{asked him}} for the truth about you. He put me off with an evasion. I <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> looked at your window. It was {{three o'clock in the}} morning. I dared not come in. A very demon of unrest was in my blood. I stopped at a night-club on my way back. Sophy was there. I asked her plainly to put me out of my agony. She was like Graillot. She fenced with me. And then--the prince came!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing more simple,' said he. 'It was our {{intention}} {{to start at}} early dawn. Feeling chilled after dressing, I thought that a cup of wine would do me no harm, so I <b>came</b> <b>down</b> to see what I could find. As I was rummaging about, the house was suddenly carried by assault so rapidly {{that by the time}} I had climbed the stairs it was all over. It only remained for me to save myself, so I <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> hid myself in the back cellar, where you have found me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{your brother}} {{back to the}} ballroom," [...] Peter Ruff directed. [...] "Make him dance--dance yourself. Don't give yourselves away by looking anxious. When the time is short--say at a quarter to two--he can <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> wait for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{sounds very}} nice, but I don't believe {{a word of}} it. You did it purposely, and you can't make me believe {{anything}} else. <b>Come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> fight. I dare you to!" [...] Jimmy was {{getting more and more}} angry every minute.|$|E
6000|$|From {{your letter}} {{you seem to}} have taken an active feeling, to say the least, in this matter, that I would {{like to talk to you}} about. I could write, but do not want to do so. Why not <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> see me? ...|$|E
5000|$|As Maxey {{recalls the}} episode, [...] "It was {{very early in}} the AIDS crisis, the disease wasn't very well understood, and the {{commissioner}} of health began talking about declaring HIV a 'quarantinable disease.' I was working with AIDS activists, and I went to Mauzy and asked him could we get involved. He answered, as he always did, 'Well, get something organized.' So we called committee hearings, and I contacted Dr. Mathilde Krim, at the time the foremost authority on AIDS and an advocate for patients. She <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> testified against the quarantine.".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} do it now, senor, {{if it makes}} no {{difference}} to you. Then we can have our evening meals at home with our families, <b>and</b> <b>come</b> straight <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> start." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look what {{an example}} he's had, mother," [...] George laughed; [...] "but really {{he has taken}} great pains ever since he knew that you were coming home. He has been asking me to tell him of {{anything}} he does which is not right, especially about eating {{and that sort of}} thing. You see he had never used a fork till we <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> he made me show him directly how it should be held and what to do with it. It has been quite funny to me to see him watching me at meals, and doing exactly the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He did," [...] {{answered}} Lieutenant Carrol, as {{he shook}} hands with both boys. [...] "And your brother and a detachment of Company A have gone out to look for Matt Gilroy and his gang. Benson went with them, and I was asked to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> escort you to the fort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is a grand}} sight," [...] said Mr. Chipperton. [...] "I {{never saw}} {{anything}} to equal it in any transformation scene at a theatre. Some of our theatre people ought to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> study it up, so as to get up something of the kind for exhibition in the cities." ...|$|E
60|$|THE LADY. I can't imagine. But this I know. She made a bet {{with him}} that she would <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> obtain {{possession}} of that list and get clean away into the street with it. He took the bet on condition that she brought it straight back {{to him at the}} War Office.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{and outside}} work among the voters will, to a certainty. I {{want you to}} <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> by <b>and</b> by and work privately among the rag-tag and bobtail. You shall spend money among them; I will furnish it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I rather {{believe he}} will. At any rate {{he has found}} a gentleman, a baronet, who has the same name and bears the same coat of arms as is on the seal which was in my father’s bundle. We are trying now to trace how my father <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> where he lived before he started. You see I must get as clear a story as I can before I go to see this gentleman. Mind, I don’t want {{anything}} from him. He may be as rich as a lord for anything I care, and may refuse {{to have anything to}} do with me, but I want to find out to what family I really belong.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{he went to}} Will's Creek on business. I saw the Indians {{coming and}} I tried to run away. But they shot at me with their arrows and one passed through my left shoulder. Then I pretended {{to go into the}} house and hide, and when they came in I leaped through a back window and ran for this place. I got into the water up to my {{shoulders}} and pulled a bit of a board over my head, to keep out of sight. They <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> I thought sure they'd find me, but they did not. But I am nearly perished with the cold, and the wound from the arrow has made me very faint. You will help me, won't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But Mrs. Peyton was too {{preoccupied with}} her news {{to notice the}} circumstance, and too nervous in her haste to be tactful. [...] "Susy, your father has invited that boy, Clarence Brant,--you know that {{creature}} we picked up and assisted on the plains, {{when you were a}} mere baby,--to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> make us a visit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{somebody}} {{got me to}} <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> then locked that {{trap door}} on me," [...] grumbled the miser. He got up with difficulty and crawled slowly to the kitchen, the boys coming after him {{to see that he}} did not fall back. [...] "Oh, dear, what a time I have had of it!" [...] he whined.|$|E
6000|$|... "About noon. After that {{we decided}} to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> {{at the same time}} look for your father. Philip Lapham said he would remain, to look after Jackson, who was as yet too weak to walk. We left all our {{provisions}} up there and came down here as fast as we could--and here we are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} what, my dear girl," [...] said Richard, [...] "when I get affairs in general settled, I shall <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> I think, <b>and</b> rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It don't {{improve my}} night's rest," [...] I {{answered}} somewhat surlily I fear. [...] "I <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> for peace <b>and</b> quiet. Can't {{you do it}} in the daytime?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then if I marry at all,' said Roger, {{with all}} his {{prejudice}} expressed strongly in his voice, 'I trust I may not marry a lady of her country. She does not think that she is to marry you, <b>and</b> yet she <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> stays with you. Paul, I don't believe it. I believe you, but I don't believe her. She is here with you in order that she may marry you. She is cunning and strong. You are foolish and weak. Believing as I do that marriage with her would be destruction, I should tell her my mind,--and leave her.' Paul at the moment thought of the gentleman in Oregon, and of certain difficulties in leaving. 'That's what I should do. You must go in now, I suppose, and eat your dinner.' ...|$|R
