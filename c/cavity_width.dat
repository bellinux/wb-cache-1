Since typical face-frames are 1+1/2 in {{wide and}} {{frameless}} side panels 3/4 in, {{access to the}} cabinet interior is 1+1/2 in wider for a typical frameless cabinet relative to a face-frame cabinet. A 12 in cabinet accommodates a 10 in drawer in frameless construction or a 8+1/2 in drawer in framed construction. The 1+1/2 in difference is most significant for narrower face-frame cabinets. Hence, the nomenclature [...] "full-access." [...] Custom (higher-cost) face-frame cabinets, which use one 1+1/2 in stile to frame two cabinet openings, can also accommodate wider drawers comparable to frameless cabinets. Frameless wall-oven cabinetry further saves 3 in of wall space {{as compared to the}} same wall-oven installed in a face-frame cabinet, Many, if not most, contemporary ovens (and other cabinet-front-mounted major appliances) have been designed with the space-utilization advantage of frameless cabinets installation in mind. The oven is dimensioned, and thermally insulated, to fit within an industry-standard external width 27 or 30 in cabinet cavity, less two standard 3/4 in cabinet side-wall thicknesses while providing for a small space between the oven box and the internal cabinet wall. In ovens, the bezel is sized to fit the full external <b>cavity</b> <b>width</b> and overlay the cabinet side wall. Such an installation avoids any unused lateral space around the oven. (While, hypothetically, ovens can be installed similarly in face-frame cabinets, such an installation may requires cutting away all but 3/4 in of each 1+1/2 in face-frame - specifically not recommended by vendors as it may weaken the joint between side-wall and face-frame - and buttressing face-frame cabinet side walls accordingly.) ...|$|E

The effects of structure parameters of labyrinth seals on sealing performance were numerically studied by the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The sealing length was considered as a constant, while the <b>cavity</b> <b>width,</b> cavity depth, tooth width and pressure ratio were varied. A large number of models were calculated to study the effects of various variables on leakage of labyrinth seals. Firstly, the results show that the effects of the cavity depth on leakage could be ignored compared with that of the <b>cavity</b> <b>width</b> and sealing length. Secondly, the optimal labyrinth seals with lowest leakage can be obtained with the appropriate values of cavity widths. Furthermore, for a certain pressure ratio, the optimal cavity widths resulting in the lowest leakage were demonstrated to be stable irrespective of the values of cavity depth and sealing length. Finally, increasing pressure ratio gives rise to an increase in the optimal <b>cavity</b> <b>width.</b> It reveals that the higher the pressure ratio is, the longer the <b>cavity</b> <b>width</b> is needed to reduce the leakage...|$|E

The experiments were performed using a recently developed fine-bubble technique in which fine hydrogen bubbles are produced electrolytically in salt solution to simulate the buoyancy effect in the chimney caused by temperature differences. During the experiments, one sidewall of the solar chimney was uniformly "heated", corresponding to a uniformly distributed solar radiation incidence. Velocities at the room inlet were measured by a particle tracking method; in turn, the average flow rate through the solar chimney system was determined. Parameters studied in the experiments were the <b>cavity</b> <b>width</b> of the solar chimney, the solar radiation intensity, the ventilation inlet areas, and the solar chimney height. Results showed that for a given building geometry and inlet areas, there is an optimum <b>cavity</b> <b>width</b> at which maximum ventilation flow rate can be achieved.

The simulations capture the underlying physics of polymer {{flow from the}} nanometer to millimeter length scale and examine geometry and thermophysical process quantities affecting cavity filling. Variations in embossing tool geometry and polymer film thickness during viscous flow distinguish different flow driving mechanisms. Three parameters can predict polymer deformation mode: <b>cavity</b> <b>width</b> to polymer thickness ratio, polymer supply ratio, and Capillary number. The ratio of <b>cavity</b> <b>width</b> to initial polymer film thickness determines vertically or laterally dominant deformation. The ratio of indenter width to residual film thickness measures polymer supply beneath the indenter which determines Stokes or squeeze flow. The local geometry ratios can predict a fill time based on laminar flow between plates, Stokes flow, or squeeze flow. Characteristic NIL capillary number based on geometry-dependent fill time distinguishes between capillary or viscous driven flows.

An experiment facility has been constructed at UW-Madison to measure the leakage rate and pressure drop of S-CO 2 flow through labyrinth seals. Various geometries and conditions have been tested to study the flow characteristic and provide validation data for numerical study. The CFD simulation of this scenario is performed under the framework of an open source CFD code OpenFOAM. Fluid properties of S-CO 2 are implemented into the code.

Optimization of the seal geometry is performed by studying the effects of geometrical parameters like radial clearance, tooth width, cavity depth, <b>cavity</b> <b>width,</b> and the number of teeth.

Conjugate conduction-natural convection heat transfer {{is carried out}} to compute the heat leak / R-Value for different numbers of air-filled cavities and for different cavity layouts. Interaction between conduction and convection at the boundaries is considered rather than the classical isothermal and adiabatic boundary conditions reported in open literature. This is believed to provide more accurate estimation of the heat transfer rate across the walls. Therefore, boundary conditions include a heat balance at the boundaries between the two heat transfer modes. Results show that {{increasing the number of}} cavities can be effective in reducing the heat flux without compromising the building blocks strength. Nevertheless, a considerable reduction in the heat flux or increase in the R-value can be achieved through changing the layout of the cavities within the wall.

In the present work, rarefied hypersonic flows over two- and three-dimensional cavities at an altitude of 80 km in the Earth’s atmosphere are studied numerically. To model flows in the transitional regime, where the validity of the Navier Stokes equations is questionable, the direct simulation Monte Carlo method has been used.
