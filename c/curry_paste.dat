Very popular in Thailand is nam phrik kapi, a spicy condiment made with fresh shrimp paste and most often eaten together with fried pla thu (short mackerel) and fried, steamed or raw vegetables. In Southern Thailand there are three types of shrimp paste: one made only from shrimp, one containing a mixture of shrimp and fish ingredients, and another paste that is sweet. 'Nam prik meng daa' is available in Hat Yai and Satul markets. Meng is a night flying bug and its body fluids are pressed and mixed with 'kapi', quite sweet. 'nam prik makaam' is 'kapi' mixed with tamarind, more sour.|$|R
5000|$|The dish {{known as}} balti {{was invented in}} Birmingham in the 1970s in {{restaurants}} owned {{by members of the}} Pakistani community in Sparkbrook, many of whom had migrated to the city from the Mirpur area of Pakistan in the 1960s. When non-Pakistani customers began to visit their restaurants, they required curries to be cooked more quickly than occurred in traditional Mirpuri cuisine and the restaurateurs consequently developed dishes in which meat was cooked off the bone at higher temperatures in steel dishes with fresh dried spices rather than <b>curry</b> <b>pastes</b> and vegetable oil in place of the traditional ghee. The steel dishes in which the food was cooked were called [...] "baltis" [...] (said to derive from the Hindi word [...] "balty" [...] meaning a bucket) and then the food was served in the steel dishes with naan bread.|$|R

Kroeung is {{traditionally}} made by finely chopping the ingredients and grinding them together using a heavy mortar and pestle although mechanical food processors can be used in modern kitchens. The resulting paste is similar in form and function to Thai <b>curry</b> <b>pastes.</b> Various ingredients, depending on the dish and the taste of the cook, can be pounded into kroeung. The eight most commonly used are Lemon grass, Magrut lime zest and leaves, Galangal, Turmeric, Garlic, Shallots, Dried Red Chillies and various Rhizomes (Lesser Galangal, Boesenbergia rotunda (ខ្ជាយ), Kaempferia galanga, etc.).This herbal paste is essential for preparing Khmer dishes in order to create the authentic flavour.|$|R

50|$|Curry powder is a spice {{mixture of}} widely varying {{composition}} {{developed by the}} British during {{the days of the}} Raj as a means of approximating the taste of Indian cuisine at home. Masala refers to spices, and this is the name given to the thick and pasty sauce based on a combination of spices with ghee (clarified butter), butter, palm oil or coconut milk. Most commercial curry powders available in Britain, the U.S. and Canada rely heavily on ground turmeric, in turn producing a very yellow sauce. Lesser ingredients in these Western yellow curry powders are often coriander, cumin, fenugreek, mustard, chili, black pepper and salt. By contrast, curry powders and <b>curry</b> <b>pastes</b> produced and consumed in India are extremely diverse; some red, some yellow, some brown; some with five spices and some with as many as 20 or more. Besides the previously mentioned spices, other commonly found spices in different curry powders in India are allspice, white pepper, ground mustard, ground ginger, cinnamon, roasted cumin, cloves, nutmeg, mace, green cardamom seeds or black cardamom pods, bay leaves and coriander seeds.|$|R
50|$|An {{ingredient}} {{found in}} many Thai dishes and used in every {{region of the country}} is nam pla, a clear fish sauce that is very aromatic. Fish sauce is a staple ingredient in Thai cuisine and imparts a unique character to Thai food. Fish sauce is prepared with fermented fish that is made into a fragrant condiment and provides a salty flavor. There are many varieties of fish sauce and many variations in the way it is prepared. Some fish may be fermented with shrimp or spices. Another type of sauce made from fermented fish is pla ra. It is more pungent than nam pla, and, in contrast to nam pla, which is a clear liquid, pla ra is opaque and often contains pieces of fish. To add this sauce to a som tam (spicy papaya salad) is a matter of choice. Kapi, Thai shrimp paste, is a combination of fermented ground shrimp and salt. It is used in the famous chili paste called nam phrik kapi, in rice dishes such as khao khluk kapi and it is indispensable for making Thai <b>curry</b> <b>pastes.</b> Tai pla is a pungent sauce used in the southern Thai cuisine, that is made from the fermented innards of the shortbodied mackerel (pla thu). It {{is one of the main}} condiments of kaeng tai pla curry and is also used to make nam phrik tai pla. Far removed from the nearest sea, from northern Thailand comes nam pu, a thick, black paste made by boiling mashed rice-paddy crabs for hours. It is used as an ingredient for certain northern Thai salads, <b>curries,</b> and chili <b>pastes.</b> It too has a strong and pungent flavor.|$|R
