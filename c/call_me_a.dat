25|$|One likely {{reason for}} the {{relatively}} few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, the words for 'fool' have meanings that vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are words like silly goose and at the other end are words like stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are words like kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are words like baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity – Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. If you <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> stupid son-of-a-bitch, I know exactly what you mean. But if you <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> baka-yarō, I cannot be so sure of what you mean. The expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E
25|$|I don't {{know why}} people <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> jazz singer, though I guess people {{associate}} me with jazz because I {{was raised in}} it, from way back. I'm not putting jazz down, but I'm not a jazz singer...I've recorded all kinds of music, but (to them) I'm either a jazz singer or a blues singer. I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but I can put the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song. What I want to do, music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, and I like all kinds of music.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} between the wars, feminists fought {{discrimination}} and establishment opposition. In Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, Woolf describes {{the extent of the}} backlash and her frustration at the waste of so much talent. By now, the word [...] "feminism" [...] was in use, but with a negative connotation from mass media, which discouraged women from self-identifying as such. In 1938, Woolf wrote of the term in Three Guineas, [...] "an old word ... that has much harm in its day and is now obsolete". When Rebecca West, another prominent writer, had been attacked as [...] "a feminist", Woolf defended her. West has been remembered for her comment [...] "I myself {{have never been able to}} find out precisely what feminism is: I only know that people <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat, or a prostitute." [...] Woolf's writing also examined gender constructs and portrayed lesbian sexuality positively.|$|E

Klebold was quoted as saying, [...] "Maybe we should start knifing people, that might be more fun." [...] (Both youths were equipped with knives.) They moved away from the table and went toward the library's main counter. Harris threw a Molotov cocktail toward the southwestern end of the library, but it failed to explode. Harris went around {{the east side of the}} counter and Klebold joined him from the west; they converged close to where Todd had moved after having been wounded. Harris and Klebold mocked Todd, who was wearing a white hat. When the shooters demanded to see his face, Todd partly lifted his hat so his face would remain obscured. When Klebold asked Todd to give him one reason why he should not kill him, Todd said: [...] "I don't want trouble." [...] Klebold said, [...] "You [...] used to <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> fag. Who's a fag now?!" [...] The shooters continued to taunt Todd and debated killing him, but they eventually walked away.|$|E

2500|$|In {{summarizing}} the biographical works on Gandhi, Blema S. Steinberg concluded she was decidedly non-ideological. Only 7.4% (24) {{of the total}} 330 biographical extractions posit ideology {{as a reason for}} her policy choices. Steinberg noted Gandhi's association with socialism was superficial; only having a general and traditional commitment to the ideology, by way of her political and family ties. Gandhi personally had a fuzzy concept of socialism. In one of the early interviews she had given as Prime Minister, Gandhi had ruminated: [...] "I suppose you could <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> socialist, but you have understand what we mean by that term...we used the word [...] because it came closest to {{what we wanted to do}} here – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy, I don't see why we should use it. I don't believe in words at all." [...] Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack of thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon. She has been described by Hindustan Times columnist, Pankaj Vohra as [...] "arguably the greatest mass leader of the last century." [...] Her campaign slogan, Garibi Hatao (Eng: Remove Poverty), has become the iconic motto of the Indian National Congress. To the rural and urban poor, untouchables, minorities and women in India, Gandhi was [...] "Indira Amma or Mother Indira." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soren Anderson of The Seattle Times {{gave the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, saying [...] "It works {{moderately}} well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture." [...] Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times called the film [...] "A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself." [...] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "Tension is one of Home's biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention." [...] Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star gave the film {{two and a half}} stars out of four, saying [...] "Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny." [...] Dana Rose Falcone of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A-, saying [...] "The combination of Homes layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice gave the film a mixed review, saying [...] "If director Tim Johnson -- adapting Adam Rex's book The True Meaning of Smekday -- can't do much with the story's confused, if well-intentioned, agenda, at least he's got some charming, vivid characters to work with." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a C, saying [...] "Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. <b>Call</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded." ...|$|E
