25|$|Smith is also {{responsible}} {{for the majority of}} the band's lyrics, which are written in a cryptic fractured form of English alternately hailed as poetic or nonsensical. He has generally refused to discuss their content, preferring to keep the words and their inspirations shrouded in mystique and allowing for fan interpretations. Smith has also sometimes employed a cut-up lyrical approach drawing on the works of (among others), William Blake, Charles Kingsley, William Shakespeare and T.S. Eliot. Two favourite <b>cut-and-paste</b> sources are Pedro Carolino’s English As She Is Spoke (a failed Victorian English-Portuguese phrasebook once hailed by Mark Twain as a perfect example of absurdity) and the nineteenth-century Irish poet George Darley. Fans have also spotted references to the films The Night of the Hunter and Eraserhead in Smith's words and music videos.|$|E
25|$|Optimal {{substructure}} {{means that}} the solution to a given optimization problem {{can be obtained by}} the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems. Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of recursion. For example, given a graph G=(V,E), the shortest path p from a vertex u to a vertex v exhibits optimal substructure: take any intermediate vertex w on this shortest path p. If p is truly the shortest path, then it can be split into sub-paths p1 from u to w and p2 from w to v such that these, in turn, are indeed the shortest paths between the corresponding vertices (by the simple <b>cut-and-paste</b> argument described in Introduction to Algorithms). Hence, one can easily formulate the solution for finding shortest paths in a recursive manner, which is what the Bellman–Ford algorithm or the Floyd–Warshall algorithm does.|$|E

25|$|Head motion {{correction}} {{is another}} common preprocessing step. When the head moves, the neurons under a voxel move and hence its timecourse now represents largely that {{of some other}} voxel in the past. Hence the timecourse curve is effectively cut and pasted from one voxel to another. Motion correction tries different ways of undoing this to see which undoing of the <b>cut-and-paste</b> produces the smoothest timecourse for all voxels. The undoing is by applying a rigid-body transform to the volume, by shifting and rotating the whole volume data to account for motion. The transformed volume is compared statistically to the volume at the first timepoint {{to see how well}} they match, using a cost function such as correlation or mutual information. The transformation that gives the minimal cost function is chosen as the model for head motion. Since the head can move in a vastly varied number of ways, {{it is not possible to}} search for all possible candidates; nor is there right now an algorithm that provides a globally optimal solution independent of the first transformations we try in a chain.|$|E

500|$|Having {{not been}} in a proper studio since [...] "Deadweight", Beck felt anxious to [...] "go in and just do some stuff real quick", and {{compiled}} several songs he had had for years. Beck and his bandmates hammered out fourteen songs in fourteen days, although just twelve made it onto the album, 1998's Mutations. Beck decided on Nigel Godrich, producer for Radiohead's OK Computer the previous year, to be behind the boards for the project. Godrich was leaving the United States for England in a short time, {{which led to the}} album's quick production schedule—"No looking back, no doctoring anything". The whole point of the record was to capture the performance of the musicians live, an uncharacteristic far-cry from the <b>cut-and-paste</b> aesthetic of Odelay. Though the album was originally slated for release by Bong Load Records, Geffen intervened and issued the record against Beck's wishes. The artist then sought to void his contracts with both record labels, and in turn the labels sued him for breach of contract. The litigation went on for years and it remains unclear to this day if it has ever been completely resolved. Beck was later awarded Best Alternative Music Performance for Mutations at the 42nd Grammy Awards.|$|E
500|$|Beck blends country, blues, rap, {{jazz and}} rock on Odelay, {{the result of}} a year and half of feverish [...] "cutting, pasting, layering, dubbing, and, of course, sampling". Each day, the musicians started from scratch, often working on songs for 16 hours straight. Odelays {{conception}} lies in an unfinished studio album Beck first embarked on following the success of [...] "Loser", chronicling the difficult time he experienced: [...] "There was a cycle of everyone dying around me," [...] he recalled later. He was constantly recording, and eventually put together an album of somber, orchestrated folk tunes; one that, perhaps, [...] "could have been a commercial blockbuster along with similarly themed work by Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and Nirvana". Instead, Beck plucked one song from it—the Odelay album closer [...] "Ramshackle"—and shelved the rest ("Brother" [...] and [...] "Feather In Your Cap" [...] were however later released as B-Sides). Beck was introduced to the Dust Brothers, producers of the Beastie Boys' album Paul's Boutique, whose <b>cut-and-paste,</b> sample-heavy production suited Beck's vision of a more fun, accessible album. After a record executive explained that Odelay would be a [...] "huge mistake", he spent many months thinking [...] "that I'd blown it forever".|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{interactive}} mesh cutting method in this paper, {{which is based}} on a formulation of semi-supervised learning. Users first assign foreground and background seed faces on a given triangular mesh by sketch lines. Then the system computes a scalar field across the mesh. After that a coarse segmentation boundary is computed out respect to a specific iso-value, which leads to a refined boundary by tracing the isoline in the scalar field. Our proposed methods are easy for implementing. The presented computing framework can not only do segmentation for single static mesh models using shape information, but also do segmentation for dynamic mesh models based on deformation information. By integrating the proposed mesh cutout tool, we also demonstrate a simple sketch-based mesh editing system. In our system the cutting results can be further deformed, morphed, or <b>cut-and-pasted.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper offers}} a {{detailed}} account of the encounter of developing countries with antitrust laws. It analyzes the phenomenal spread of these laws in the developing world since the early 1990 s, the reasons why they adopted these laws, the challenges they face and the competition laws that fit their needs. It shows how these laws were initially adopted due to international pressure and treaty conditionality. It also shows that, contrary to prescriptions, the laws adopted are not drafted to address the special needs of developing countries and are simply <b>cut-and-pasted</b> from the laws of advanced nations. It highlights how this reality offers a further challenge to the implementation of these laws. This makes formatting a competition policy that is unique and tailored to the country’s needs a priority that should guide the implementation of these laws. ...|$|R

In his book discussing music of the counterculture era, James Perrone stated that the song represented a type of impressionistic psychedelia, in particular for its cello playing repeated bass notes and its theremin. Professor of American history John Robert Greene named [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] among examples of psychedelic or acid rock. Stebbins wrote that the song was [...] "replete with sunshine [...] psychedelia". Uncut wrote that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] was [...] "three minutes and thirty-six seconds of avant-garde pop". Mixdown described it as a [...] "masterpiece of avant-pop". Steve Valdez says that, like Pet Sounds, Brian was attempting a more experimental rock style. It has since been marketed as pop music, [...] "possibly because it comes across relatively innocent compared with the hard-edged rock we have since come to know", according to historian Lorenzo Candelaria. Sound on Sound argues that the song [...] "has as many dramatic changes in mood as a piece of serious classical music lasting more than half an hour". Tom Roland of American Songwriter described the piece as being [...] "with its interlocking segments—a sort of pop version of the classical sonata, consisting of a series of musical movements". New York Magazine compared it to [...] "a fugue with a rhythmic beat". John Bush compared the track's fragmented <b>cut-and-paste</b> style to 1960s experimentalists such as William S. Burroughs.|$|E
500|$|Apart from {{a change}} in musical style, the band changed the way they recorded. [...] "It {{was the first time}} we sort of jammed," [...] Coxon revealed. [...] "We've never really jammed before. We've been quite white-coaty, overall about recording, like in a laboratory. Yeah, we did {{actually}} feel our way through just playing whatever came to our minds and editing, which was really exciting." [...] "We just played together for two weeks in a way we hadn't done since 1991," [...] Dave recalls. [...] "We wanted to purify the sound, to not have anything there not played by us. We reasoned that if we made small changes at the input end, we could effect large changes in the output." [...] According to producer Stephen Street, [...] "Blur had decided that commercial pressures and writing hit singles wasn't going to be the main consideration any more. The mood in the studio was very different to when I'd first worked with them." [...] "In the studio, once we got past those first few days, where I felt everyone was treading on eggshells, there was a great atmosphere. I think it was because they didn't want to be competing with anyone on this record, they wanted to make a record that would help keep the band together." [...] Street had acquired a new piece of hardware, described as [...] "muso-ish to talk about but really useful" [...] which enabled him to sample loops and otherwise <b>cut-and-paste</b> entire sections of the band's jam sessions.|$|E

40|$|Quoting {{parts of}} a {{document}} is a very common task when writing scientific papers. Usually an author <b>cut-and-pastes</b> a source quote to a new document, which inherently causes problems. Transclusions – invented in 1960 by Ted Nelson – are a possible solution: they {{are a kind of}} function which returns the data to be included in a new document and also adds some links to and from the original context of the quote. This paper presents some ideas and problems when using transclusions in an existing digital journal environment. The creation process of transclusions with LATEX-macros is described and tools supporting this task are listed in this paper. After uploading a special ‘markuped’ document to the server, a serverprocess is responsible for assembling the content. This includes the transfer of up-to-date content to the client, management of changes etc. Additional navigation (i. e. hyperlinks) is also generated on the server side, therefore users are not forced to use a dedicated browser for the journal articles. Authors and readers of a document using transclusions profit from this architecture and the original context of a quote is just a mouse-click away. The paradigm of transclusions is useful for all participants involved in the creation and reading of articles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} a method to identify when a student essay is off-topic, i. e. the essay does {{not respond to the}} test question topic. This task is motivated by a real-world problem: detecting when students using a commercial essay evaluation system, Criterion SM, enter off-topic essays. Sometimes this is done in bad faith to trick the system; other times it is inadvertent, and the student has <b>cut-and-pasted</b> the wrong selection into the system. All previous methods that perform this task require 200 - 300 human scored essays for training purposes. However, there are situations in which no essays are available for training, such as when a user (teacher) wants to spontaneously write a new topic for her students. For these kinds of cases, we need a system that works reliably without training data. This paper describes an algorithm that detects when a student’s essay is offtopic without requiring a set of topic-specific essays for training. The system also distinguishes between two different kinds of off-topic writing. The results of our experiment indicate that the performance of this new system is comparable to the previous system that does require topicspecific essays for training, and conflates different types of off-topic writing...|$|R

However, the Da'wah Centre charged that by omitting the context of Hussein's statements, MEMRI had distorted the actual intent of the speech. While admitting that the Sheikh was emotional and used strong words, the Centre stated that the speech was delivered in relation to rape cases in Iraq, the birth defects due to use of depleted uranium and the Burmese Buddhist massacre.

In this talk, I shall examine parallel algorithms across lì procedure texts of the first-millennium CE to highlight the fluidness of the linguistic representation of algorithms within a very specific subculture of mathematics.
