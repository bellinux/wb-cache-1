40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the insurance responsibility for damage caused in relation with a major accident. The main goal of this task is to evaluate the state intervention {{in the form of}} a <b>compulsory</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> for firms, which can cause a major accident. In my work I will support the thrust of the state intervention and will try to find a premise for that. I will show that the target of <b>compulsory</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> is not to complicate life of new firms or of existing ones. I want to demonstrate that compulsory insurance leads to a better precaution for a major accident and it can also lead to precaution and safety investments. Further, I want to point out that compulsory insurance does not protect only firms, but also their creditors and employees. The protection company is to avoid a pointless risk in case that the firm itself takes too low an aversion towards risk. If the firm employes the <b>compulsory</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance,</b> the insurance company becomes another control body that is responsible for safety. This is consequently a benefit for taxpayers, whose money is not used for some damages caused by insolvent companies. The benefit for creditors and injured employees is also a big security in case of an accident, where an insurance company ensures a company's solvency. There are many other good reasons for compulsory insurance, and we can definitely find bad reasons too. Overall however, I see compulsory insurance as beneficial...|$|E
40|$|Minimum asset and {{liability}} insurance requirements must often be met {{in order for}} parties to participate in potentially harmful activities. Such financial responsibility requirements may improve parties' decisions whether to engage in harmful activities and, if so, their efforts to reduce risk. However, the requirements may undesirably prevent some parties with low assets from engaging in activities. Liability insurance requirements tend to improve parties' incentives to reduce risk when insurers can observe levels of care, but dilute incentives to reduce risk when insurers cannot observe levels of care. In the latter case, <b>compulsory</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> may be inferior to minimum asset requirements. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{treats the}} {{differences}} in terms of insurance between optional and <b>compulsory</b> third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurances.</b> It also treats {{the purpose of the}} <b>compulsory</b> third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurances</b> and their accordance with that purpose. The primary purpose of the optional third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> is to ensure the policyholder financial resources to cover possible claims for damages. The primary purpose of the <b>compulsory</b> third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> is to render possible the compensation of a third party for damage done. The policyholders financial ability to pay damages is of subordinate interest, and the purpose of <b>compulsory</b> third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurances</b> is thus twofold. Estate agents, insurance agents and accountants are required by law to have a third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> linked to their enterprises. The terms of the <b>compulsory</b> third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurances</b> are, unlike the optional insurances, dictated by the legislator. As a result, the compulsory insurance has not been developed at the same pace as the optional. This is a consequence of an unwillingness on behalf of the authorities, to compromise and to adapt the third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> {{in order to make it}} more in accordance with its purpose. Therefore, the insurance companies have also been less inclined to grant insurance on the exposed premises, which has resulted in the above-mentioned enterprise-owners risking insurance distress. The legislation of each trade offers the possibility to leave other security than the holding of a <b>compulsory</b> third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> to protect the third party. According to this paper, this possibility has not been enough emphasised. The conception"third party protection"should, according to the author, be emphasised in each legislation, irrespective of the form chosen. The risk exposure the enterprise-owners are exposed to can cause problems for the insurance companies in determining what liabilities should be covered by the <b>compulsory</b> third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurance.</b> Damage prevention activities are carried out to different extent within each trade organisation, but <b>compulsory</b> third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurances</b> are better suited within legislations where the insurance companies have good control over the proportions of the damages and as a result can assess the risk of damage more easily...|$|R

A distinction is made between first party (victim) insurance and third party (liability) insurance. It is argued that under some circumstances compulsory victim insurance may be valid e. g. when information problems or externalities arise. The major argument in favour of <b>compulsory</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> is insolvency of the potential injurer. His insolvency may lead to underdeterrence. This can be cured through making the purchase of insurance compulsory. However, equally, a few limits and warnings {{with respect to the}} introduction of a duty to ensure are presented. If the moral hazard problem cannot be cured or if insurance is not sufficiently available making insurance compulsory may solve more problems than it cures. Also, it is argued that a major disadvantage of compulsory insurance is that it may make governments too dependant on the insurance market. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{profession}} {{of law is}} an important mediator between the justice and the individual in terms of representing defense {{as a part of}} fair hearing and providing individuals to use their constitutional rights and liberties. If the lawyer causes any damage to his client or the person whom he renders a legal advice, he is confronted with action for damages. The insurance company liberates the lawyer from this liability. In the study, firstly, the place, the principles and field of application of liability insurance in the Turkish insurance law are examined. Especially there have been considerations about the application of theories that are associated with the determination of realization moment of the risk on professional liability insurance. The definition of the {{profession of}} law, the effects of the professional obligations to liability and the relationship between liability and the 'contract and tort relation' were introduced. The subject is also researched in terms of advocacy partnership with the changes that are made in the Law of Advocates which took its place in our country but which is hardly seen in enforcement. It would be useful to make lawful arrangements as soon as possible to make lawyers have the <b>compulsory</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> in the beginning of their profession due to the possible compensation threats that can be caused from act of omission.

The basis for the article was the study of real estate developers in 15 cities with the population over 1 million people. The article presents the data of the types of fund raising for building housing in the cities with the population over 1 million people, the regional differentiation in this parameter is highlighted. The article has explored the implementation of mechanisms ensuring the liability of developers for transfering premises to the shareholders. The main factors considered in the article are the form of registration of the relationship between a developer and an individual — an investor, as well as the mechanisms ensuring the liability of developers. It is shown that in some regions, the level of protection of the participants of shared construction is low. The mechanisms ensuring the liability of developers including the legal requirements for liability insurance and guarantee of credit institution are systematized. In the article, the key term of the liability insurance of builders for default on obligations or improperly performing the obligations on the delivery of residential properties, and also the condition of the guarantee of credit institution on the delivery of residential properties are considered. The regional features of how people participate in the construction of housing are described in the context of mechanisms ensuring the liability of developers. The use of various ensuring mechanisms, the differences in insurance by the commercial organizations and by joining the mutual society are shown. The results of the study can be used at the correction of the state and regional policy in the field of housing construction. In the article, it is shown that in the future, the strengthening of the value of financial mechanisms providing the liability insurance of developers should be expected in the connection of the growth of a number of incomplete housing for which the law provides a <b>compulsory</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> of developers or security of credit organizatio...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} claim relations arises with a damage {{covered by}} a liability insurance. The first claim relation is of course the one between the claimant and the liable as a claim for damages. The other claim relation arises between the liable in his capacity of insured and his insurer as a claim for compensation under the liability insurance. There is a tight {{connection between the two}} claim relations {{because of the fact that}} it is the claimant’s claim for damages that gives rise to the claim for insurance compensation. The insured persons claim for insurance compensation is just a claim to be indemnified for his liability against the claimant. Because of this close connection between the two claim relations one might think that also a third claim relation, i. e. between the claimant and the insurer, should arise. Would it not be suitable to let the claimant direct his claim directly to the liability insurer? Such a right shall be called a direct action. There is a few differences between the applicable law in Sweden and Finland regarding a claimants rights to a direct action against the liable’s insurer. The Swedish Law of Insurance Contracts (FAL) does not give the claimant an explicit right to raise a claim directly against the liable’s insurer. However, the Swedish claimants have been given such a right by the courts when the liable is bankrupt. This right to direct action has in jurisprudence been considered an imperative right, despite the fact that the regulation itself is not imperative. There has been a debate in Sweden about whether the claimant’s right really should be called a direct action. An essential difference between the Swedish and the Finnish direct action is that the insured persons marketing can trigger a direct action in Finland, something that I have questioned the suitability of. I have questioned the suitability of an absolute direct action because it is, in my opinion, not corresponding with the purpose of liability insurance. As an alternative method for ensuring the claimant’s rights of compensation I have suggested an increased use of <b>compulsory</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance,</b> combined with a right to direct action. Such a solution seems more appropriate to me and it avoids the forcing of a claimant’s interest into free relations of contract...|$|E

As such, the DRC insurance market remained largely undeveloped. A clear indication of this is that in 2014 SONAS placed USD 82 million of premium, which is substantially less than the potential insurance market. A simple comparison between Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) and Gross Written Premium (“GWP”) shows this. The DRC generated a GDP of USD 32.69b in 2013, in line with Ivory Coast whose growth was USD 31.06b. While the GWP in Ivory Coast was USD 500m, USD 82m only were generated in the DRC. Common expectation is that an additional $400 million of premiums are bought for the Congo, without Sonas being involved. This is known as the informal insurance sector.|$|R

Basic types of motor insurance, which represent the domestic market, are analyzed. It was found that the share of motor insurance in the insurance market of Ukraine is significant.
