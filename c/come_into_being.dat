Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art...

5|$|The last tenet, '{{socialism}}', did {{not mean}} socialism as it is defined in the West, but rather a unique form of Arab socialism. Aflaq coined the word Arab socialism for his variant of socialism. Socialism, in its original form in the Arab world had, according to Aflaq, first <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> {{under the rule of}} Muhammad. The point of Arab socialism was not to answer questions such as: how much state control was necessary, or economic equality; but instead Arab socialism was a system that freed the Arab people from oppression and enslavement, which in turn created independent individuals.|$|E
40|$|Consider a {{specific}} type of fission where psychological continuity takes a branching form, and one of the offshoots <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> later than the other offshoot. Let us say that the earlier offshoot <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> in the left branch at t, and the later offshoot <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> in the right branch at t+ 1. With regard to the question how many persons are involved in this case, three answers are worth considering: (i) The original subject persists up to t; a distinct person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> immediately after t and continues to exist in the left branch; and the third person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> in the right branch at t+ 1. (ii) The original subject persists up to the moment immediately before t+ 1; a distinct person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> at t+ 1 and continues to exist in the left branch; and the third person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> in the right branch at t+ 1. (iii) The original subject continues to exist in the left branch; a distinct person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> in the right branch at t+ 1. For those who hold that personal identity consists in psychological continuity of some sort, the aforementioned three options exhaust the sensible ways of understanding how one persists in delayed fission. However, I argue that complications arise for each answer. Hence, delayed fission poses a challenge for the psychological approach to personal identity. close...|$|R

The Bovinae are believed to have diverged from the rest of the Bovidae in the early Miocene. The Boselaphini became extinct in Africa in the early Pliocene; their latest fossils were excavated in Langebaanweg (South Africa) and Lothagam (Kenya).|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Jinnah and Gandhi, who had by then been {{released}} from his palatial prison, met formally at the Muslim leader's home on Malabar Hill in Bombay. Two weeks of talks followed between them, which resulted in no agreement. Jinnah insisted on Pakistan being conceded prior to the British departure and to <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> immediately, while Gandhi proposed that plebiscites on partition occur sometime after a united India gained its independence. In early 1945, Liaquat and the Congress leader Bhulabhai Desai met, with Jinnah's approval, and agreed that after the war, the Congress and the League should form an interim government {{with the members of}} the Executive Council of the Viceroy to be nominated by the Congress and the League in equal numbers. When the Congress leadership were released from prison in June 1945, they repudiated the agreement and censured Desai for acting without proper authority.|$|E
5|$|Much of Durkheim's {{work was}} {{concerned}} with how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in modernity; {{an era in which}} traditional social and religious ties are no longer assumed, and in which new social institutions have <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>being.</b> His first major sociological work was The Division of Labour in Society (1893). In 1895, he published The Rules of Sociological Method and set up the first European department of sociology, becoming France's first professor of sociology. In 1898, he established the journal L'Année Sociologique. Durkheim's seminal monograph, Suicide (1897), a study of suicide rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern social research and served to distinguish social science from psychology and political philosophy. The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1912) presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.|$|E

Undeterred, Matsui began planning out new military operations in places like Xuzhou and Zhejiang Province soon after he had returned to Shanghai. The other big task occupying his time in January and February 1938 was his plan {{to establish a new}} Chinese government in Central China. Matsui was bound and determined to press forward with his ambition to found a new regime to rival Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government, and though he did not finish the job before leaving office, the Reformed Government of the Republic of China would eventually <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> in March 1938. However, the leaders of Japan's Army General Staff showed scant interest in his plan to create a new government in China and they also repeatedly refused to approve any new military campaigns under his command. By the beginning of February Matsui was contemplating suicide to protest their lack of enthusiasm.|$|E
