40|$|International audienceThis study {{deals with}} {{microwave}} properties of glass foams prepd. from glass industrial waste. Two types of cullets (one from soda-​lime silicate glasses {{and the other}} from <b>cathodic</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tubes</b> - <b>CRT)</b> have been combined with different foaming agents (C, SiC, AlN) ​. Glass foams electromagnetic properties are primarily detd. by their apparent d. {{as well as by}} the nature of the foaming agent. Foams, blown with carbon as foaming agent, present high dielec. loss and could be used as green electromagnetic absorbent in building industry...|$|R
