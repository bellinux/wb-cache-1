Within three experimental years, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), fall rye (Secale cereale L.), yellow sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were grown as cover crops with cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis), and compared to monoculture cauliflower.

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} the dispersal rate of wild <b>cabbage</b> <b>root</b> <b>flies</b> in agricultural systems, to test a migration hypothesis and the predictions of a computer simulation model. The dispersal rate was determined by a new method, from the age-grouping of wild flies instead of releasing marked culture flies. The mean distance dispersed was calculated from-the slope of density of captured flies on distance; the mean age was calculated from laboratory measurements of development at constant temperatures. A new method of male age determination was developed, based on the changes in pupal fat and testes colour. The published method of female age determination was improved to allow more rapid separation of nulliparous and parous flies. The values of the slope and intercept fitted to the-density- distance data were strongly correlated. A computer simulation demonstrated that random noise causes a progressive underestimation of the slope, as the catch decreases. The slope for gravid females reaches a limiting value of approxiamately 0. 2, indicating a mean distance dispersed of 500 m. A numerical integration suggests that 95 % of the flies move less than 580 m. There {{was no evidence of}} the female migratory phase, proposed by Finch & Skinner(1975), which was probably an artefact of the use of ANCS attractant. The dispersal rate was estimated at 49 - 165 m/day, compared with 29 - 87 m/day predicted by the simulation model. There was little evidence that dispersal alters with agricultural practice.

5000|$|This species {{resembles the}} closely related <b>cabbage</b> <b>root</b> <b>fly</b> in {{appearance}} {{though it is}} slightly larger at seven to eight millimetres long. The body is light gray and the yellowish wings are transparent with yellow veins. Over most of its range, {{there is only one}} generation of this fly each year.

They are white and cigar-shaped and are laid in groups of thirty or forty eggs at the root collar of the host plant or on the ground nearby. Often several females lay eggs on one plant. The glossy white or yellow larvae hatch in five to fourteen days. They feed for about forty days, moulting three times, eating the young roots or tunneling into the main root of the host plant or even penetrating into the basal part of the leaves of hearting cabbage. The pupae are brown and about six millimetres in length. The insect overwinters as a pupa in the ground at a depth of five centimetres or more.

The first generation peaks in late April to early May having overwintered in diapause. Recently, populations have been discovered in which the emergence of first generation flies was protracted, lasting until mid-July. The project aimed to investigate the incidence of late emergence in Devon and to examine the ways in which late emergers differed from early emergers in their progress through diapause. A new emergence trap was developed and used in conjunction with yellow water traps to monitor the emergence of <b>cabbage</b> <b>root</b> <b>fly</b> populations at locations of contrasting agricultural practice. Late emergence was widespread in Devon, occurring later (up to September), and in a greater proportion of some populations than any previously reported. The phenomenon appears to be a response to the planting of brassicas in June, as flies emerging at the normal time {{may not be able to}} locate a host crop. Emergence in a substantial proportion of one population was delayed for a year.

Olfactometry studies carried out under laboratory conditions revealed that plants harbouring the highest number of eggs in the field were also highly attractive, suggesting that olfactory stimuli are responsible, at least partially, for the differential infestation levels observed in the field. In a push-pull' context, this study demonstrates that different brassicaceous plants could be used to redistribute cabbage root flies in broccoli crops without compromising herbivore control by natural enemies. In addition, the importance of plant volatiles for infestation levels suggests a potential for developing a semiochemically assisted push-pull' system in which trap plants would be enhanced by synthetic release of attractive compounds...|$|E
