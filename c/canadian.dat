5|$|Constant {{shelling}} had {{blocked the}} Ravebeek stream, creating an impassable swamp directly between {{the boundary of}} the 3rd <b>Canadian</b> and the 4th <b>Canadian</b> Divisions, necessitating a two-prong attack. The 3rd <b>Canadian</b> Division was assigned the wider advance on the left, which included the sharply rising ground of the Bellevue spur. In the more restricted ground south of the Ravebeek stream, the 4th <b>Canadian</b> Division would occupy advanced positions in no man's land {{before the start of}} the offensive and take Decline Copse, which straddled the Ypres–Roulers railway. Currie planned the attack with extensive depth in resources. The remaining units of the 8th, 9th and 10th <b>Canadian</b> Infantry Brigades were placed in support, while the 7th, 11th and 12th <b>Canadian</b> Infantry Brigades were held in divisional and corps reserve.

5|$|For {{the first}} time all four <b>Canadian</b> {{divisions}} were assembled to participate in a battle. The nature and size of the planned <b>Canadian</b> Corps assault necessitated support and resources beyond its normal operational capabilities. Consequently, the British 5th Infantry Division and supplementary artillery, engineer and labour units reinforced the four <b>Canadian</b> divisions. This brought the nominal strength of the <b>Canadian</b> Corps to about 170,000 men, of whom 97,184 were <b>Canadian.</b>|$|E

It consisted of the British I Corps, responsible for the extreme eastern flank of the Allied lines and II <b>Canadian</b> Corps (Lieutenant General Guy Simonds) south of Caen.
