5|$|When Voyager 1 {{is unable}} to {{communicate}} directly with the Earth, its digital tape recorder (DTR) <b>can</b> <b>record</b> about 64 kilobytes of data for transmission at another time. Signals from Voyager 1 take over 19 hours to reach Earth.|$|E
5|$|In the {{unfolding}} plot, the player learns that Tachikawa and Elaine were killed (by the sabotage of their gun-ships) to procure microchips implanted in their brains. These chips <b>can</b> <b>record</b> a pilot's knowledge and combat skills; Nanosoft desired them {{to power the}} artificial intelligence in their weapons. The G-Police commander Horton is assassinated by Slater's traitorous wingman Ricardo, also to this end. The game ends with {{the destruction of a}} large spacecraft by Slater; the closing sequence reveals that Nanosoft had planned to use this to exert military dominance over other corporations.|$|E

5|$|Information {{about the}} {{structure}} and function {{of the human brain}} comes from a variety of experimental methods, including animals and humans. Information about brain trauma and stroke has provided information about the function of parts of the brain and the effects of brain damage. Neuroimaging is used to visualise the brain and record brain activity. Electrophysiology is used to measure, record and monitor the electrical activity of the cortex. Measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas, or of the activity of a single neuron. An electroencephalogram <b>can</b> <b>record</b> the electrical activity of the cortex using electrodes placed non-invasively on the scalp.|$|E
5|$|The SIII has an 8-megapixel camera {{similar to}} that of the Galaxy SII. It can take 3264×2448-pixel {{resolution}} photos and record videos in 1920×1080-pixel (1080p) resolution. Samsung improved the camera's software over that of its predecessor to include zero shutter lag, and Burst Mode and Best Shot, which work together to quickly take numerous photos before the best-judged frame is selected. The phone can also take pictures while recording videos. The rear-facing camera is complemented by a 1.9-megapixel front-facing camera that <b>can</b> <b>record</b> 720p videos. The phone has LED flash and autofocus.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{added two}} new {{instruments}} to Hubble. The first instrument, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, {{is now the}} most sensitive ultraviolet spectrograph installed on the telescope. Its far-UV channel is 30 times more sensitive than previous instruments and the near-UV is twice as sensitive. The second instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3, is a panchromatic wide-field camera that <b>can</b> <b>record</b> {{a wide range of}} wavelengths, including infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. Atlantis also carried the Soft-Capture Mechanism, which was installed onto the telescope.|$|E

5|$|The {{electron}} microscope directs a focused {{beam of electrons}} at a specimen. Some electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle, and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material. Microscopists <b>can</b> <b>record</b> these changes in the electron beam to produce atomically resolved images of the material. In blue light, conventional optical microscopes have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 200nm. By comparison, {{electron microscope}}s are limited by the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. This wavelength, for example, is equal to 0.0037nm for electrons accelerated across a 100,000-volt potential. The Transmission Electron Aberration-Corrected Microscope is capable of sub-0.05nm resolution, {{which is more than}} enough to resolve individual atoms. This capability makes the electron microscope a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging. However, electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain.|$|E

25|$|Whereas Y-DNA and mtDNA haplogroups {{represent}} {{but a small}} {{component of}} a person’s DNA pool, autosomal DNA {{has the advantage of}} containing hundreds of thousands of examinable genetic loci, thus giving a more complete picture of genetic composition. Descent relationships can only be determined on a statistical basis, because autosomal DNA undergoes recombination. A single chromosome <b>can</b> <b>record</b> a history for each gene. Autosomal studies are much more reliable for showing the relationships between existing populations, but do not offer the possibilities for unravelling their histories {{in the same way as}} mtDNA and NRY DNA studies promise, despite their many complications.|$|E
25|$|Virgin TV branded its {{original}} high-definition (HD) Digital Video Recorder (PVR) service as V+. The service uses a PVR set-top box, with three tuners and a 160GB hard disk {{for up to}} 80 hours' recording. The presence of three tuners means that V+ <b>can</b> <b>record</b> two channels {{at the same time}} while viewers watch a third. This contrasts with most other PVR systems such as Sky+, which supports only two tuners. In December 2010 a 1TB TiVo HD PVR from Cisco was released, with a 500GB model released in May 2011. From late 2011, Samsung Electronics will join Cisco as a second supplier of TiVo STBs for Virgin Media.|$|E
