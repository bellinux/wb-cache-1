5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, {{so that it can}} be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and <b>calcium</b> <b>nitrate.</b> It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E

Other oxidizers can be used as well, like sodium and <b>calcium</b> <b>nitrates</b> as well as mixtures of sodium and potassium nitrate or potassium chlorate (KClO3). KNO3 can be acquired through purchasing a granular “stump remover" [...] from stores that carry garden supplies. Other rarely used oxidizers are ammonium and potassium perchlorate.|$|R
25|$|In the nitro{{phosphate}} {{process or}} Odda process (invented in 1927), phosphate rock {{with up to}} a 20% phosphorus (P) content is dissolved with nitric acid (HNO3) to produce a mixture of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and <b>calcium</b> <b>nitrate</b> (Ca(NO3)2). This mixture can be combined with a potassium fertilizer to produce a compound fertilizer with the three macronutrients N, P and K in easily dissolved form.|$|E
25|$|In July 1812, {{the cave}} was {{purchased}} from Simon and other owners by Charles Wilkins and an investor from Philadelphia named Hyman Gratz. Soon the cave was being mined for <b>calcium</b> <b>nitrate</b> on an industrial scale, utilizing a labor force of 70 slaves {{to build and}} operate the soil leaching apparatus, {{as well as to}} haul the raw soil from deep in the cave to the central processing site.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the logical}} follow through is sound, the corning {{hypothesis}} has been refuted for two reasons. One, the powder makers were probably {{more worried about}} spoilage than the effect of corned gunpowder on guns, and two, corning as a practice had existed in China since the 1370s. In Europe corning arose {{as a response to}} the difficulty of obtaining pure saltpeter, specifically saltpeter consisting of potassium nitrate, rather than sodium nitrate or <b>calcium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> the latter two of which absorb water vapor more readily than potassium nitrate. Thus corning was an imperative to producing reliable weaponized gunpowder. Supposedly this was much less problematic in Asia, where pure saltpeter was more readily available and easily manufactured. In China gunpowder corning had been practiced since the 1370s for the purpose of strengthening the explosive power of mines, since gunpowder corns provided more space required for a rapid combustion. Corned powder might also have been used in guns based on a record of a fire-tube shooting a projectile 457 meters, a feet probably only possible with the aid of corned powder at the time.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{commercial}} molten salt mixture {{was a common}} form of saltpeter, 60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate. Saltpeter melts at 220°C (430°F) and is kept liquid at 290°C (550°F) in an insulated storage tank. <b>Calcium</b> <b>nitrate</b> can reduce the melting point to 131°C, permitting more energy to be extracted before the salt freezes.

The structure {{of the use of}} nitrogen fertilizers, foreign trade and balance of the market of urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium <b>nitrate,</b> <b>calcium</b> ammonium <b>nitrate,</b> ammonium phosphate and UAN were analysed. Geographical directions of foreign trade were specified. The results showed that the domestic fertilizer sector is fully self-sufficient in the area of production of various nitrogen fertilizers. The most commonly used nitrogen fertilizers were: ammonium <b>nitrate,</b> urea and <b>calcium</b> ammonium <b>nitrate</b> while the importance of ammonium nitrate was clearly reduced.

Early stages of processing will tend to produce foul-smelling gases, with hydrogen sulfide being most common in generating complaints. Large process plants in urban areas will often treat the odors with carbon reactors, a contact media with bio-slimes, small doses of chlorine, or circulating fluids to biologically capture and metabolize the noxious gases. Other methods of odor control exist, including addition of iron salts, hydrogen peroxide, <b>calcium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> etc. to manage hydrogen sulfide levels.|$|E
2500|$|The Union Navy {{blockaded}} {{the southern}} Confederate States, which reduced {{the amount of}} gunpowder that could be imported from overseas. The Confederate Nitre and Mining Bureau was formed to produce gunpowder for {{the army and the}} navy from domestic resources. Nitre is the English spelling of [...] "Niter". While carbon and sulfur were readily available throughout the south, potassium nitrate was often produced from the <b>Calcium</b> <b>nitrate</b> found in cave dirt, tobacco barn floors and barn stalls other places.

The trail stretched from Pendleton County to the western terminus of the route {{in the town of}} Union, Monroe County. Nearly half of these caves are on the West Virginia side, including Organ Cave and Haynes Cave. In the late 18th-century, saltpeter miners in Haynes Cave found large animal bones in the deposits. These were sent by a local historian and frontier soldier Colonel John Stuart to Thomas Jefferson. The bones were named Megalonyx jeffersonii, or great-claw, and became known as Jefferson's three-toed sloth. It was declared the official state fossil of West Virginia in 2008. The West Virginia official state rock is bituminous coal, and the official state gemstone is silicified Mississippian fossil Lithostrotionella coral.|$|E
2500|$|Lithography {{works because}} of the mutual {{repulsion}} of oil and water. The image is drawn {{on the surface of}} the print plate with a fat or oil-based medium (hydrophobic) such as a wax crayon, which may be pigmented to make the drawing visible. A wide range of oil-based media is available, but the durability of the image on the stone depends on the lipid content of the material being used, and its ability to withstand water and acid. After the drawing of the image, an aqueous solution of gum arabic, weakly acidified with nitric acid [...] is applied to the stone. The function of this solution is to create a hydrophilic layer of <b>calcium</b> <b>nitrate</b> salt, , and gum arabic on all non-image surfaces. The gum solution penetrates into the pores of the stone, completely surrounding the original image with a hydrophilic layer that will not accept the printing ink. Using lithographic turpentine, the printer then removes any excess of the greasy drawing material, but a hydrophobic molecular film of it remains tightly bonded to the surface of the stone, rejecting the gum arabic and water, but ready to accept the oily ink.|$|E

This was also done to determine abundance, distribution and extent of cohabitation of the anophelines and to identify them to species level. Larval abundance in swamps, drainage channels, a dam and {{a pool of water}} were determined through sampling conducted using the dipping technique. Sampled larvae were then reared to adults and identified to species level using morphological characters. Habitats were characterized based on vegetation, water quality, habitat permanence, pH, conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, total dissolved solids, <b>calcium,</b> <b>nitrates</b> and chlorides. Anophelines were found breeding in swamps primarily populated with Typha species. The water in the breeding sites was dirty and organically polluted with decaying plant and animal waste. Data analysis using variable selection by stepwise regression followed by multiple regressions of larval densities with significant variables showed that the abundance of mosquito larvae was positively correlated with salinity. Larval density was not affected by pH, conductivity, turbidity, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, temperature, <b>calcium,</b> <b>nitrates</b> and chlorides. Three members of the An. gambiae complex were identified: An. arabiensis, An. merus and An. quadriannulatus.
