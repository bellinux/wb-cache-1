The thrust of the NASA SSP {{initiative}} is to develop concepts and demonstrate technology for applying space solar power to NASA missions. Providing power from satellites in space via wireless transmission to a receiving station either on earth, another celestial body or a second satellite is one goal of the SSP initiative. The sandwich design is a satellite design in which the microwave transmitting array is the front face of a thin disk and the back of the disk is populated with solar cells, with the microwave electronics in between. The transmitter remains aimed at the earth in geostationary orbit while a system of mirrors directs sunlight to the photovoltaic cells, regardless of the satellite's orientation to the sun.

40|$|Abstract—As {{the solar}} {{electricity}} market has matured, {{energy conversion efficiency}} and storage have joined installed system cost as significant market drivers. In response, manufacturers of flat-plate silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells have pushed cell efficiencies above 25 %—nearing the 29. 4 % detailed-balance efficiency limit— and both solar thermal and battery storage technologies have been deployed at utility scale. This paper introduces a new tandem so-lar collector employing a “PVMirror ” {{that has the potential}} to both increase energy conversion efficiency and provide thermal storage. A PVMirror is a <b>concentrating</b> <b>mirror,</b> spectrum splitter, and light-to-electricity converter all in one: It consists of a curved arrangement of PV cells that absorb part of the solar spectrum and reflect the remainder to their shared focus, at which a second solar converter is placed. A strength of the design is that the solar converter at the focus can be of a radically different technology than the PV cells in the PVMirror; another is that the PVMirror converts a portion of the diffuse light to electricity in addition to the direct light. We consider two case studies—a PV cell located at the focus of the PVMirror to form a four-terminal PV–PV tandem, and a thermal receiver located at the focus to form a PV–CSP (concen-trating solar thermal power) tandem—and compare the outdoor energy outputs to those of competing technologies. PVMirrors can outperform (idealized) monolithic PV–PV tandems that are under concentration, and they can also generate nearly as much energy as silicon flat-plate PV while simultaneously providing the full energy storage benefit of CSP.

40|$|Reverse osmosis (RO) is a {{well-known}} process for desalinating seawater and brackish groundwater. Desalination is energy-intensive, so using photovoltaic (PV) panels to power the process is an attractive environmentally friendly concept, especially for community-scale systems. Increasing the system efficiency will lower {{the total cost of}} water produced, making the systems more economically competitive for a greater number of geographic locations. The thermal behaviors of PV panels and RO systems are complementary and can be exploited to improve photovoltaic reverse osmosis (PVRO) system efficiency. For a given level of solar radiation, a PV panel produces more electrical power at lower panel temperatures. For a given applied pressure, the flow of clean water across an RO membrane increases with increasing temperature. By using the RO feed water to cool the PV panels and warming the water in the process, more electrical power can be produced and higher flow rates of clean water across the RO membrane can be achieved, increasing total daily water production. The ability to cool the PV panels permits the use of low-cost, flat-plate <b>concentrating</b> <b>mirrors,</b> which further increase electrical power and clean water production. This thesis develops a thermal management system to improve the performance of a small-scale PVRO. Preliminary case studies show that the thermal exploitation concept is feasible and that a 50 % increase in the total daily clean water production of a PVRO system is achievable, with an active thermal controller. A thermal controller is proposed that optimizes the PVRO system performance by minimizing the temperature of the solar panel and maximizing the temperature of the RO feed water. The control system uses a solar panel-mounted heat exchanger, circulator pump and servo valves to maximize water production while operating within the temperature limits of both the solar panel and the reverse osmosis membrane. Preliminary controller simulations show that it can successfully manage the temperatures of both the solar panel and RO feed water. The thermal management concept was experimentally validated on a small-scale, 300 L/day PVRO system. A 57 % increase in clean water production was achieved using thermal management and solar <b>concentrating</b> <b>mirrors,</b> which agrees well with simulated performance predictions. by Leah C.

The realization {{of a system that}} combines photovoltaic modules, solar thermal collectors and <b>concentrating</b> <b>mirrors</b> makes it a complicated system to study. So far, only simple studies have been made on Cogenra’s LCPVT system including a 2 -dimensional model. In this project, the possibility of using a Computational Fluid Dynamics software for analysing the low concentration PV/Thermal system of Cogenra has been studied. The CFD software Ansys Fluent has been used, in which a model was created in accordance to the Cogenra LCPVT system. After validating the results, the model has been used for analysing the system’s performance under various conditions in order to realize the system’s losses. Furthermore, due to the numerous components of the system, the analysis of the LCPVT system becomes a multi-variable problem. For this reason, three main parameters (mass flow rate, optical concentration, PV type) that affect the system’s performance has been chosen and studied in order to improve the system’s overall efficiency. Since the system has both electrical and thermal outputs, an equivalent efficiency was determined to express the two different efficiency terms. For the purpose of comparing the performance of the LCPVT system with the traditional photovoltaic modules, one other simple model was created in Ansys Fluent.

Increasing the system efficiency will lower {{the total cost of}} water produced, making the systems more economically competitive for a greater number of geographic locations. It is noted in this paper that the amount of water produced by a PV-powered RO (PVRO) system can be increased if the temperatures of the solar panel and the reverse osmosis feed water are actively managed. For a given level of solar radiation, a photovoltaic panel produces more power at a lower temperature. Also, for a given power, an RO system produces more clean water at a higher input (feed) water temperature. An active thermal management system is needed to exploit these complementary characteristics by cooling the solar panel and warming the RO feed water, increasing the amount of fresh water produced. This can be accomplished by running the RO feed water through a heat exchanger attached {{to the back of the}} solar panel, cooling it. Furthermore, the ability to cool the solar panels permits the addition of low-cost, flat-plate <b>concentrating</b> <b>mirrors</b> to be used with the PV panels, which further increases the PV power output.

Numerous studies have shown the effects of carbon dioxide emissions on global climate change, and even showing the permanence of high carbon dioxide levels after emissions cease. Current trends away from carbon emitting power facilities are pushing solar energy into a position for many new solar power plants to be constructed. Terrestrial solar energy at AM 1. 5 is generally given at 1 kW/m 2, which is a vast free source of energy that can be be harvested to meet the global demand for electricity. Aside from some areas receiving intermittent levels of solar insolation, one of the largest hindrances to large scale solar power production is obscuration of sunlight on solar collectors caused by dust deposition. In areas with the highest average solar insolation, dust deposition is a major problem for maintaining a constant maximum power output. The southern Negev desert in Israel receives on average 17 g/m 2 per month in dust deposition on solar installations, which in turn causes losses of a third of the total power output of the installation. In these areas, water is a scarce commodity, which can only be used to clean solar installations at a prohibitive cost. To resolve this problem, a cost effective solution would be the application of electrodynamic screens (EDS), which can be implemented by embedding a set of parallel electrodes into the sun facing surface of solar collectors, including <b>concentrating</b> <b>mirrors</b> or photovoltaic (PV) modules, and applying a low frequency pulsed voltage to these electrodes. Three major contributions made {{in the course of this}} research in advancing (EDS) for self-cleaning solar mirrors are: (1) development of non-contact specular reflectometer for solar mirrors that allows measurement of reflectance loss as a function of dust deposition, (2) development of a dust deposition analyzer capable of measuring size distribution of deposited dust and provides mass concentration of dust on the surface of the mirror, and (3) optimization of electrode geometry of EDS film for minimizing optical reflection losses caused by the lamination of the film on the mirror surface while maintaining high reflection efficiency with high dust removal efficiency.

40|$|Solar {{radiation}} {{reflected by}} <b>concentrating</b> <b>mirrors</b> is attenuated due to atmospheric extinction as it {{travels to the}} receiver of a solar tower plant. The lack {{of information on the}} magnitude of extinction increases the uncertainties in yield analysis and tower plant design. In-situ measurements of atmospheric extinction as well as measurement correction methods have been recently performed and developed (Hanrieder et al., 2012, 2015), but specific information is unavailable for individual plant projects. It is well known though that the extinction varies significantly with site and time. To overcome this absence of information a model to derive the attenuation loss between heliostat and receiver from common direct normal irradiance (DNI) measurements was developed by Sengupta and Wagner (2011) (SW 2011 model). We present an updated version of that model and a comparison between the performance of the models using extinction measurements. In the new approach presented here, different precipitable water vapor (PWV) amounts are considered and the model is adjusted to the elevation of the investigated site. The strongest assumption in this approach is the assumption about the aerosol extinction height profile. Three different height profiles are tested for the Plataforma Solar de Almerı´a (PSA) resulting in three different new transmittance models. The SW 2011 as well as the three new models are evaluated with one year of corrected extinction data derived with the ABC (absorption and broadband correction) method of Hanrieder et al. (2015) and a Vaisala FS 11 scatterometer at PSA. The new models show a mean difference to the reference data set of 0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 03 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0. 052, 0. 056 and 0. 049 (compared to a mean bias of � 0. 08 and RMSE of 0. 095 for the SW 2011 model for transmittances through a 1 km slant range). These results indicate the importance of adequate assumptions for the aerosol height profile. Testing the developed TM with the LIVAS height profile (Amiridis et al., 2015) for PSA shows satisfying results and this motivates testing the approach for other sites. By applying an additional correction for the Linke turbidity (TL) derived as in Ineichen and Perez (2002) the mean bias can be further lowered. An uncertainty analysis shows that the absolute uncertainty coincide with the RMSE levels of the evaluation. Performing the additional TL correction promises an improvement of the overall performance of the model. The new models outperform the SW 2011 model due to the PWV and elevation adjustments. The approach can be applied for different sites and incorporated in already existing ray-tracing or plant optimization tools. It is expected to be valuable for reducing uncertainty in power tower design and operations...|$|R
