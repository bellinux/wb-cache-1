5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, <b>celery,</b> <b>and</b> spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.|$|E

40|$|The {{content of}} the {{potentially}} health-defensive and disease-preventive flavonoids quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, apigenin and luteolin of 31 vegetables were determined by RP- HPLC with UV detection. Vegetables were purchased at the local markets in Budapest at a period of their most frequent consumption. Quercetin levels in the edible parts of most vegetables were generally below 10 mg kg- 1, except for onions (67 - 121. 5 mg kg- 1), lettuce (13. 5 - 35. 0 mg kg- 1), dill (74. 5 mg kg- 1), broccoli (15. 5 mg kg- 1) and spinach (272. 2 mg kg- 1). Kaempferol was below 30 mg kg- 1 except for parsnip (66. 4 mg kg- 1) and leek (45. 8 mg kg- 1). Myricetin could only be detected in lettuce, Swedish turnip, parsley <b>and</b> <b>celery</b> leaves, <b>and</b> dill. Detectable amount of luteolin was in radishes, some representatives of Brassica, sweet peppers, <b>celery</b> leaves <b>and</b> spinach while apigenin was only in Swedish turnip, <b>celery</b> root <b>and</b> <b>celery</b> leaves.
