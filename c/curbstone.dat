5000|$|Starting with 2008 Videanu {{is under}} {{corruption}} investigation regarding a business with {{raw materials for}} constructions (i.e. <b>curbstones).</b> His own companies {{were involved in the}} scandalous affair of the [...] "curbstonization" [...] of the Romanian capital city, Bucharest. A large number of streets from Romanian capital were paved with new <b>curbstones</b> imported from China during the period of 2006-2008. The traffic was severely disturbed, rising the dissatisfaction of Bucharest inhabitants. According to some preliminary data Videanu's companies obtained illegally 4 million euros from state funds.|$|R
40|$|The {{high point}} densities {{obtained}} by today’s airborne laser scanners enable {{the extraction of}} various features that are traditionally mapped by photogrammetry or land surveying. While significant {{progress has been made}} in the extraction of buildings and trees from dense point clouds, little research has been performed on the extraction of roads. In this paper it is analysed to what extent road sides can be mapped in point clouds of high point density (20 pts/m 2). In urban areas <b>curbstones</b> often separate the road surface from the adjacent pavement. These <b>curbstones</b> are mapped in a three step procedure. First, the locations with small height jumps near the terrain surface are detected. Second, midpoints of high and low points on either side of the height jump are generated, put in a sequence, and used to fit a smooth curve. Third, small gaps between nearby and collinear line segments are closed. GPS measurements were taken to analyse the performance of the road side detection. The analysis showed that the completeness varied between 50 and 86 %, depending on the amount of parked cars occluding the <b>curbstones.</b> The RMSE in the comparison with the GPS measurements was 0. 18 m...|$|R
25|$|As Kennedy's {{motorcade}} {{passed through}} Dealey Plaza at about 12:30p.m. on November 22, Oswald fired three rifle {{shots from the}} sixth-floor window of the book depository, killing the President and seriously wounding Texas Governor John Connally. One shot apparently missed the presidential limousine entirely, another struck both Kennedy and Connally, and a third bullet struck Kennedy in the head, killing him. Bystander James Tague received a minor facial injury from {{a small piece of}} <b>curbstone</b> that had fragmented after it was struck by one of the bullets.|$|E

In the second season, Wally and Beaver are seen walking home from school with their schoolbooks and entering the house through the front door. In the third through fifth seasons, Wally and Beaver are seen walking towards the Pine Street house. Beaver carries a baseball glove and limps along the <b>curbstone.</b> In the last season, Beaver, arguing with Wally as the two are walking home, pushes Wally {{into the street and}} they start chasing each other around a tree and into the house.|$|E
25|$|Among today's Danish writers, {{probably}} the best-known to international readers is Peter Høeg (Smilla's Sense of Snow; Borderliners). Benny Andersen writes poems, short stories, and music. Poems by both writers have {{been translated into}} English by the <b>Curbstone</b> Press. Klaus Rifbjerg has published over 100 novels as well as poetry, short stories and TV plays. Two of his works have been translated into English: Witness to the Future and War. Kirsten Thorup's novel Baby, winner of the 1980 Pegasus Prize, is published in English by the University of Louisiana Press. The psychological thrillers of Anders Bodelsen also appear in English as {{do some of the}} novels of intrigue by Leif Davidsen. Suzanne Brøgger and Vita Andersen focus largely on the changing roles of women in society.|$|E

50|$|In 1899, {{the present}} Perry Avenue Bridge was constructed. The one-lane stone bridge carries the road over Silvermine River near the Silvermine Tavern grist mill. In {{the flood of}} 1955, water flowed over the bridge. The span {{was put on the}} National Register of Historic Places in October 2006. That year one of the bridge's <b>curbstones</b> fell into the water, and for the six months before Memorial Day weekend in 2008 the span was closed as repairs were made. The bridge is so narrow that when at times when cars try to pass another, <b>curbstones</b> can be hit. The Norwalk city {{government}} spent $350,000 in repairs, which included masonry restoration, new railings, repaving and further narrowing so that drivers would not be tempted to try to pass. A parade with antique cars was held to celebrate the reopening of the bridge.|$|R
25|$|In 1987, {{residents}} {{and others from}} the Aarti Hotel on Leavenworth Street founded the 509 Cultural Center at 509 Ellis Street. After the 1989 earthquake damaged that facility, artists founded The Luggage Store at 1007 Market, {{at the intersection of}} 6th Street, Market, Taylor and Golden Gate Avenue. In 1989 the Tenderloin Reflection and Education Center (TREC) spun off from St Anthony foundation and operated a cultural center including dance, music, writing quilting, and other arts workshops in the St. Boniface Neighborhood Center. Artists and activists such as Eric Ehn from the Iowa Writing Workshop and Theatre Artaud; Miya Masoaka, a recording artist with Asian Improv Records; Lucy Jane Bledsoe, published novelist and writer for the East Bay Express; Pearl Ubungen, choreographer; Ben Clarke, Founding Editor of Freedom Voices; and Maketa Groves, poet and published author at <b>Curbstone</b> Press; and Tenderloin resident and Athabaskan poet Mary TallMountain offered numerous free workshops. TREC and its publishing project Freedom Voices continue to offer workshops on an occasional basis at the Public Library, Hospitality House, the Faithful Fools and other locations in the neighborhood. Tender Leaves, the Center's literary journal was published from 1987 to 2006.|$|E
500|$|The Santa Rosa de la Eminencia castle {{was built}} [...] {{on the site}} of the old San Bernardo fortress; its {{construction}} started on 24 March 1677 and finished , under the command of governor Don Juan Fermín de Huidobro. Construction of the fortress began by order of governor Juan Muñoz de Gadea after a group of French pirates attacked the city in early 1677. The castle is positioned at the top of a hill that overlooks the city of La Asunción, and next to a reservoir. It comprises three defensive fronts, each one with two bastions, two half bastions and three curtains. The castle also includes barracks, a chapel, and a cistern, located at the parade along a <b>curbstone</b> and the ramp leading to the upper level. La Asunción was founded in 1562 by Pedro González Cervantes de Albornoz on the Santa Lucía valley, located at the eastern part of the Margarita island on the state of Nueva Esparta. The city was an important stronghold at the Venezuelan War of Independence.|$|E

2500|$|The House of Atys (2nd century BC) {{was named}} for the {{castrated}} lover of Cybele, because of a marble relief of Atys found in the ruins. [...] It had an atrium with a shallow basin, or impluvium, {{in the center and}} a well with a <b>curbstone</b> lip, stone benches, and was richly built. [...] It was probably a schola, a reception hall for the college of Dendrophores, associated with the neighboring temple.|$|E

60|$|The {{object was}} {{to make it easy}} to wheel and convey the goods from the ships across to the {{warehouses}}. For, as the ships and boats go into almost all the streets in the town, goods have to be wheeled across every where, from the margin of the quay to the warehouses of the merchants, and a range of <b>curbstones</b> and gutter would make an obstacle that would be very much in the way.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1907, Engelhardt {{published}} his contribution on the kilometer stone {{which was to}} replace the milestone, suggesting the use of <b>curbstones</b> which were being replaced by paving flags. The smooth side could be engraved with red-painted Roman figures, marking each kilometer. While still at the Academy, he designed new tramcars for Københavns Sporvogne (Copenhagen Tramways), replacing the usual rectangular profiles with rounded contours both inside and out so as {{to provide a more}} human look for passengers.|$|R

50|$|The {{improvements}} to the canal sufficed {{for only a few}} more years. Demand for Medina sandstone had been declining in the face of competition from Portland cement, and it was desired only for <b>curbstones.</b> In the late 1940s, that ceased as most easily accessible beds of the material had been exhausted. Albion also suffered when the New York State Thruway was opened to the south, near Batavia, displacing both canal and rail as a freight route.|$|R

After {{the cessation of}} LIRR operations, the BRT started passenger service and transferred freight service to a subsidiary, Brooklyn Heights Railroad, which provided freight service with three locomotives, with a fourth delivered in 1907. It carried mail for the United States Postal Service, as well as lumber, cement, sand, stone, ashes, pipe, marble for headstones, and granite for <b>curbstones.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{city itself}} had not changed--to the eye. It had greatly {{increased}} in spread and population, but {{the look of}} the town was not altered. The dust, waste-paper-littered, was still deep in the streets; the deep, trough-like gutters alongside the <b>curbstones</b> were still half full of reposeful water with a dusty surface; the sidewalks were still--in the sugar and bacon region--encumbered by casks and barrels and hogsheads; the great blocks of austerely plain commercial houses were as dusty-looking as ever.|$|R

40|$|Survey {{managers}} are still discovering {{the usefulness of}} digital audio recording for monitoring and managing field staff. Its value {{so far has been}} for confirming the authenticity of interviews, detecting <b>curbstoning,</b> offering a concrete basis for feedback on interviewing performance and giving data collection managers an intimate view of in-person interviews. In addition, computer audio-recorded interviewing (CARI) can improve other aspects of survey data quality, offering corroboration or correction of response coding by field staff. Audio recordings may replace or supplement in-field verbatim transcription of free responses, and speech-to-text technology might make this technique more efficient in the future...|$|R
50|$|The ashlar-constructed bridge had {{originally}} five arches. It was 40 m long and 4 m wide. The main arch span was 12.0 m {{and the others}} 8.5 m in length. It underwent three major reparations, the last two times in 1709 and in 1946. During the last reparation, a staircase was added to {{each end of the}} bridge when the west-most one arch and the east-most two arches were ripped off. Today, the bridge has two arches only. The two original stone alms pots and the <b>curbstones</b> on the bridge are still preserved. Due to its unusual appearance, it is dubbed by the citizens the Hunchback Bridge (Kambur Köprü).|$|R
2500|$|The {{square and}} park began to attract upscale residents, and was {{continually}} upgraded, {{with the addition}} of gaslight and <b>curbstones,</b> the laying out of streets around the square [...] which the church laid out, graded and named, but then ceded to the city, the construction of a fence around the park in 1866 to which residents received keys, and extensive landscaping, including gravel paths and flowerbeds, and trees such as [...] catalpas, cottonwoods, horse chestnuts and silver birches. In addition to serving the local residents, the park was used for church events, including annual festivals for children of the parish. During the coldest winters, the park trustees flooded the park to create a large ice skating rink.|$|R
