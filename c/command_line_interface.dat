The 128–496MB of {{available}} memory on the Raspberry Pi is at least twice the minimum requirement of 64MB needed to run Slackware Linux on an ARM or i386 system. (Whereas the majority of Linux systems boot into a graphical user interface, Slackware's default user environment is the textual shell / <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>interface.)</b> The Fluxbox window manager running under the X Window System requires an additional 48MB of RAM.|$|E

25|$|Older {{mainframe}} databases, and {{the newer}} microcomputer based systems that {{were based on}} them, generally {{did not have a}} SQL-like command processor between the user and the database engine. Instead, the data was accessed directly by the program – a programming library in the case of large mainframe systems, or a <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>interface</b> or interactive forms system in the case of dBASE and similar applications. Data from dBASE could not generally be accessed directly by other programs running on the machine. Those programs may be given a way to access this data, often through libraries, but it would not work with any other database engine, or even different databases in the same engine. In effect, all such systems were static, which presented considerable problems.|$|E
25|$|Currently most {{operating}} systems support {{a variety of}} networking protocols, hardware, and applications for using them. This means that computers running dissimilar {{operating systems}} can participate in a common network for sharing resources such as computing, files, printers, and scanners using either wired or wireless connections. Networks can essentially allow a computer's operating system to access the resources of a remote computer to support the same functions as it could if those resources were connected directly to the local computer. This includes everything from simple communication, to using networked file systems or even sharing another computer's graphics or sound hardware. Some network services allow the resources of a computer to be accessed transparently, such as SSH which allows networked users direct access to a computer's <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>interface.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{first known}} {{graphical}} adventure game was Mystery House (1980), by Sierra On-Line, {{then at the}} time known as On-Line Systems. The game featured static vector graphics atop a simple <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>interface,</b> building on the text adventure model. Sierra would continue to produce similar games under the title Hi-Res Adventure. Vector graphics would give way to bitmap graphics which also enabled for simple animations to show the player-character moving in response to typed commands. Here, Sierra's King's Quest (1984), though not {{the first game of}} its type, is recognized as a commercially successful graphical adventure game, enabling Sierra to expand on more titles. Other examples of early games include Koei's Night Life and Danchi Tsuma no Yuwaku (1982), Sherwood Forest (1982), Yuji Horii's Portopia Serial Murder Case (1983), The Return of Heracles (which faithfully portrayed Greek mythology) by Stuart Smith (1983), Dale Johnson's Masquerade (1983), Antonio Antiochia's Transylvania (1982, re-released in 1984), and Adventure Construction Set (1985), one of the early hits of Electronic Arts.|$|E

This version will also include tweaks to system apps, such as an address bar in the Registry Editor, Windows PowerShell being the default <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>interface</b> instead of the Command Prompt and the Windows Subsystem for Linux being upgraded to support Ubuntu 16.04. This version of Windows 10 was released on 11 April 2017 as a free update.|$|E
2500|$|The Support Element is {{the most}} direct and lowest level way to access a mainframe. It {{circumvents}} even the Hardware Management Console and the operating system running on the mainframe. The HMC is a PC connected to the mainframe and emulates the Support Element. All preceding zSeries mainframes used {{a modified version of}} OS/2 with custom software to provide the interface. System z9's HMC no longer uses OS/2, but instead uses a modified version of Linux with an OS/2 lookalike interface to ease transition as well as a new interface. Unlike the previous HMC application on OS/2, the new HMC is web-based which means that even local access is done via a web browser. Remote HMC access is available, although only over an SSL encrypted HTTP connection. The web-based nature means that {{there is no longer a}} difference between local console access and remote access, which means a remote user potentially has full control if authorized, allowing more flexibility for locating systems within data centers. IBM refers to the new HMC as a [...] "closed platform" [...] which does not allow the user to install software or access the <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>interface</b> to increase security and stability. The HMC is also firewalled by default with a minimal number of open ports for remote access.|$|E

40|$|A hybrid user {{interface}} {{is a new}} type of computer {{user interface}} that achieves high usability by combining features of graphical user <b>interfaces</b> and <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The main goal of a hybrid user interface is to increase the efficiency of a system that is used to perform repetitive tasks. By adopting the string-based input mechanism of <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>interfaces,</b> users of a hybrid user interface are able to populate graphical components using only the keyboard, eliminating the inefficiency of the computer mouse for repetitive tasks. Especially, for applications that require repetitive tasks such as entering multiple data and managing system administration, a hybrid user interface enhances the efficiency of the system significantly. A hybrid user interface can be developed as a new application or can supplement an existing graphical user interface when the efficiency of the system is of major concern. by Sehyun Ahn. Thesis (Civ.
