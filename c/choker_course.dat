40|$|The {{concept of}} {{managing}} storm water with porous or dense graded asphalt pavement {{has been done}} successfully in Minnesota since 2005, and nationally since the 1970 â€™s to provide a solution to storm water runoff and groundwater table recharge. Asphalt pavements {{have been used in}} various climate conditions with the benefits of providing runoff control, aquifer recharge, reduction of drainage structures needed to comply with storm water regulations, and increased skid resistance and safety. The most common locations for use include parking lots and low volume roads, and in high activity recreational areas like basketball and tennis courts or playground lots. Pavement design is also available for heavier load facilities. As shown in Figure 1, a typical pavement section consists of either a porous or a dense graded asphalt pavement layer on top of a <b>choker</b> <b>course</b> layer, a reservoir course (designed for runoff detention frost penetration, and structural capacity), and an non-woven geotextile over the existing soil or subgrade material...|$|E
