5|$|Clements had {{supported}} Bert T. <b>Combs</b> for governor against Chandler in 1955, {{and did so}} again against Harry Lee Waterfield in 1959. <b>Combs</b> defeated Waterfield and rewarded Clements by appointing him state highway commissioner. In 1961, Clements and <b>Combs</b> split over a proposed deal to lease dump trucks from a Louisville car dealer. State newspapers charged that the deal was payback to the dealer, a <b>Combs</b> supporter. When <b>Combs</b> canceled the deal Clements {{took it as a}} public rebuke and soon after resigned to work on the presidential campaign of his friend, Lyndon Johnson. Following his split with <b>Combs,</b> Clements allied himself with the Chandler faction, opposing Combs' lieutenant governor, Wilson Wyatt in his bid to unseat Senator Thruston Morton. Clements' influence declined rapidly after the split with <b>Combs,</b> and by the 1963 gubernatorial race, he was unable to deliver his home county for Chandler in the primary against Edward T.

5|$|In the 1959 gubernatorial primary, Chandler {{threw his}} support to Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield. The anti-Chandler forces {{eventually}} put forth Bert <b>Combs</b> as their nominee again. Having {{learned from his}} previous campaign, <b>Combs</b> now attacked Chandler for allegedly requiring state employees to donate 2% of their salaries to his campaign. According to <b>Combs,</b> Chandler had deposited the money in a Cuban bank, but the money was lost when Fidel Castro overthrew {{the government in the}} Cuban Revolution. Ultimately, <b>Combs</b> prevailed in the primary by a vote of 292,462 to 259,461. Republicans nominated John M. Robsion, Jr. to oppose <b>Combs,</b> and when Democratic President Harry S. Truman came to Paducah to campaign for <b>Combs,</b> Chandler refused to welcome him to the state, a customary duty of the sitting governor. Instead, in a letter to Truman, Chandler launched a blistering attack on his party's nominees, calling <b>Combs</b> a liar and alleging that his running mate, Wilson W. Wyatt, who had previously served in Truman's administration, had actually tried to undermine Truman by helping found Americans for Democratic Action. <b>Combs</b> ultimately won the general election by a wide margin.|$|E

50|$|The {{rectilinear}} <b>comb</b> uses {{a circular}} <b>comb</b> {{mounted on a}} drum to <b>comb</b> out the fringe and remove short fiber (set by a scale so fibers less than, for example, 25 mm are removed) not held by a clamping mechanism. The row of pins known as a top <b>comb</b> is a very fine tooth <b>comb,</b> for example 25 teeth per inch; it is inserted in cylindrical <b>combed</b> fringe {{to act as an}} impediment to contaminates (burr, seed etc.) flow. The top <b>comb</b> acts as an impediment to contamination moving into a <b>combed</b> sliver. On a next circular <b>combing</b> short finer and contaminates are removed. The circular <b>combing</b> without short fibers are placed on a moving belt in an overlapping motion. The circular <b>combing</b> and top <b>comb</b> insertion is repeated and <b>combed</b> fibers - now called tuft are overlapped. The overlapping produces some cohesion allowing the tuft then to be twisted to form a <b>combed</b> sliver. This sliver is weak and unsuitable for spinning. To allow spinning to take place additional gilling is required to introduce fiber end irregularity (Sokolov 1994).|$|R

5|$|Two {{weeks before}} the primary, <b>Combs</b> was {{endorsed}} by former Vice-President and native Kentuckian Alben W.

Chandler defeated <b>Combs</b> in the primary {{by a vote of}} 259,875 to 241,754 and went on to win his second term as governor. <b>Combs</b> returned to Prestonsburg, set up a savings and loan company, and re-established his law practice. During the four years of Chandler's term, <b>Combs</b> accepted a number of speaking engagements, but otherwise remained out of the public eye. Meanwhile, the state's need for funds compelled Chandler to raise the state sales tax and other taxes, despite his campaign promises not to do so. Consequently, Chandler lost credibility and <b>Combs</b> gained a reputation as a courageous, forthright, and honest politician for having acknowledged the state's financial need during the campaign.|$|E

As soon as <b>Combs</b> resigned from the Court of Appeals, Democratic leaders began asking him to seek the party's gubernatorial nomination in 1971, uniting the party behind him rather than splintering it between Ford and Carroll. In June 1970, Carroll announced his intent to run for lieutenant governor, indicating {{that he would like}} to serve under <b>Combs</b> as governor.
