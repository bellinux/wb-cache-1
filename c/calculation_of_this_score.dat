Pre-ECMO SAPS II was also reported to be a predictor of mortality in VA-ECMO; however, vital signs, laboratory data (including serum bicarbonate), and history of chronic disease are necessary for the calculation of SAPS II [24]. SAPS II and SOFA scores are used to predict mortality in the setting of critical illness, such as in the intensive care unit, and are not specific models for patients with ECMO. Most parameters for these scores are not available or cannot be accessed for patients with OHCA or IHCA shortly after admission to the ED.|$|E
40|$|Combinatorial {{optimization}} problems {{occur in}} a wide range of domains, from Bayesian network structure search to questions in neuroscience and biochemistry. However, all of these problems have in common the need to optimize some score, and often the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>score</b> is a significant source of slowness in the search for a solution. Through the use of a carefully calibrated approximation, however, this time can be significantly reduced with little effect on the quality of the results. I demonstrate here how such a proxy function can be used, as well as explore situations where the proxy strategy fails and offer reasons why or why not it might be suited to a particular problem.

BMC Surgery 2014, 14 : 64 [URL] LT, sepsis, injuries, and surgery can be evaluated byFull list of author information {{is available at the}} end of the articlefor patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. The model for end-stage liver disease score (MELD-score) is used for the prioritization of patients awaiting LT [1]. The MELD-score was initially developed to evaluate the prognosis after transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt (TIPS). The laboratory parameters creatinine, biliru-bin, and international normalized ratio (INR) are needed for <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>score</b> [1]. Nowadays, the MELD-tween 6 and 40 [2]. Sawitzki et al. described markers that could be used to determine a patient’s immune status. This would make it possible to tailor the extent of the individual’s immuno-suppression therapy after LT. However, the lowest possible dose of immunosuppressant needs to be determined indi-vidually in order to minimize side effects of immunosup-pression while also avoiding an increase in the rejection rate [3]. The patient’s immune status can be evaluated by the measurement of B-cell sensitization and soluble bio-markers like CD 30 [4, 5]. In addition, the immune statu...|$|E

40|$|Molecular docking is an {{important}} method for the research of protein-protein interaction and recognition. A protein {{can be considered as}} a network when the residues are treated as its nodes. With the contact energy between residues as link weight, a weighted residue network is constructed in this paper. Two weighted parameters (strength and weighted average nearest neighbors’ degree) are introduced into this model at the same time. The stability of a protein is characterized by its strength. The global topological properties of the protein-protein complex are reflected by the weighted average nearest neighbors’ degree. Based on this weighted network model and these two parameters, a new docking scoring function is proposed in <b>this</b> paper. The <b>scoring</b> and ranking for 42 systems’ bound and unbounded docking results are performed with <b>this</b> new <b>scoring</b> function. Comparing the results obtained from <b>this</b> new <b>scoring</b> function with that from the pair potentials scoring function, we found that <b>this</b> new <b>scoring</b> function has a similar performance to the pair potentials on some items, and <b>this</b> new <b>scoring</b> function can get a better success rate.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to present {{possibilities}} and specifications of using the Servqual method in service quality management in hotel industry. The Servqual method works on the definition of five dimensions of a service quality: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy. It is based on so called Gap analysis that crucially {{comes out of the}} discrepancy between a customer’s expectation and perception. Demonstrating the practical application of Servqual in hotel business is also a part of the paper, as well as verifying possibilities of customer satisfaction quantification {{with the help of the}} Gap model, evaluating general applicability and presenting suggestions for possible adaptations and further utilization in the branch of tourism. Input data necessary for the gap analysis have been gained by force of a primary field-research with the help of a quantitative research via questionnaire. The results of Servqual score for individual dimensions of service quality have also been used to calculate a total weighted score that for the examined hotel reached the value of − 0. 07. This shows that the discrepancy between expectations and perceptions of the hotel guests is minimal. However, the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>score</b> would be of a higher importance if we wanted to compare more accommodation facilities mutually or possibly to follow the development of this index in time...|$|E
