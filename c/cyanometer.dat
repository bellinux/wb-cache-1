F.H. Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) [...] "made great use of his instrument on his voyages, and ascertained by the colour the degree of blueness, the accumulation {{and the nature of the}} non-transparent exhalations of the air."--Alexander von Humboldt, by Professor Klencke, translated by Juliette Bauer, 1852, pp. 45, 46.] ...|$|E

50|$|De Saussure is {{credited}} with inventing the <b>cyanometer</b> in 1789. De Saussure's <b>cyanometer</b> had 53 sections, ranging from white to varying shades of blue (dyed with Prussian blue) and then to black, arranged in a circle; he used the device to measure {{the color of the}} sky at Geneva, Chamonix and Mont Blanc. De Saussure concluded, correctly, that the color of the sky was dependent on the amount of suspended particles in the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cyanometer</b> (from cyan and -meter) is an {{instrument}} for measuring 'blueness', specifically the colour intensity of blue sky. It is attributed to Horace-Bénédict de Saussure and Alexander von Humboldt. It consists of squares of paper dyed in graduated shades of blue and arranged in a color circle or square that can be held up and compared {{to the color of}} the sky.|$|E

In 2016 she won the 2015 Radicale Vernieuwer (radical renewer) award from the Dutch newspaper Vrij Nederland and also the Innovation in Product Design award at the first Wired Audi Innovation Awards, for Current Window, a stained glass window incorporating dye-sensitized solar cells. In 2017 she was one of three winners of the Designer of the Future award sponsored by Swarovski; tasked with using crystal, she incorporated portable solar cells within crystals to produce <b>Cyanometer,</b> a set of three objects that store ambient light as they are carried around during the day and also include LEDs to emulate the changing colors of the sky; at night they power a chandelier.|$|E
40|$|Articel in German, Abstracts in English and German. For {{the greater}} part of his life, Alexander von Humboldt was {{interested}} in colour phenomena which he observed in nature. These observations led him to do research into phenomena such as the blue colour of the sky, enigmatic dust and hail, and the colour of plants. Humboldt corresponded with many scientists about the connection between sunlight and the creation of colours, about coloured shadows, the Blue Cave in Capri, the colour of stars, plants etc. Claude-Louis Berthollet developed a model for the composition of a blue colour (Indigo), a technology which was of great importance to the textile industry. The present paper focuses on Humboldt’s interest in the blue colour of the sky, which he shared with artists, writers and scientists like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Christian Gottfried Lichtenberg, Caspar David Friedrich and Horace Bénédict de Saussure. During his travels in South America, Humboldt used Saussure’s <b>cyanometer</b> to determine the intensity of the blue colour of the sky. Later he corresponded about this instrument with his friend François Arago who had invented a <b>cyanometer</b> based on chromatic polarisation. While Humboldt was working on his “Cosmos”, Arago explained to his friend the latest results in physics, especially in polarography. Towards the end of his life, Humboldt corresponded with the painter J. G. Schall and admitted that he had somewhat lost his interest in the physical explanation of the blue colour of the sky...|$|E
