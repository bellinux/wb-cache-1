50|$|Cantaloupe soup is {{prepared}} with cantaloupe {{as a primary}} ingredient. It may be prepared in puréed form and is typically served chilled. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} muskmelon soup. Cantaloupe soup may be served as a first course or starter dish prior to a main course. The use of well-ripened cantaloupe can create an optimal texture and enhance the sweet flavor of the soup. Additional ingredients can include lime juice, lemon juice, apple juice, orange juice, salt, pepper, herbs such as mint or basil, cayenne pepper and balsamic vinegar. Spicy versions may be prepared using chili peppers. A cantaloupe soup recipe using one large cantaloupe melon, one-half <b>cup</b> <b>orange</b> juice and one-quarter cup of honey has 147 calories per one-cup serving.|$|E

5000|$|When {{cardinal}} utility is used, {{the magnitude}} of utility differences is treated as an ethically or behaviorally significant quantity. For example, suppose a <b>cup</b> of <b>orange</b> juice has utility of 120 utils, {{a cup of tea}} has a utility of 80 utils, and a cup of water has a utility of 40 utils. With cardinal utility, it can be concluded that the <b>cup</b> of <b>orange</b> juice is better than the cup of tea by exactly the same amount by which the cup of tea is better than the cup of water. One cannot conclude, however, that the cup of tea is two thirds as good as the cup of juice, because this conclusion would depend not only on magnitudes of utility differences, but also on the [...] "zero" [...] of utility. For example, if the [...] "zero" [...] of utility was located at -40, then a <b>cup</b> of <b>orange</b> juice would be 160 utils more than zero, a cup of tea 120 utils more than zero.|$|R

5000|$|At the Temptation, contestants {{are confronted}} with {{a major source of}} sugar in the American diet: Soda.

Alison tempts them further by telling them that the star is not on a <b>cup</b> of <b>orange</b> soda, reducing the number of possible cups to 190. Still, no one moves.

2500|$|Inuit {{often are}} {{relentless}} in making known {{that they are}} not like Qallunaat {{in the sense that they}} do not eat the same food and they are communal with their food. Qallunaat believe that the person who purchases the food is the owner of the food and is free to decide what happens to the food. Searles describes the Inuit perspective on food by saying that [...] "in the Inuit world of goods, foods as well as other objects associated with hunting, fishing, and gathering are more or less communal property, belonging not to individuals but to a larger group, which can include multiple households." [...] Food in an Inuit household is not meant to be saved for the family who has hunted, fished, gathered, or purchased it, but instead for anyone who is in need of it. Searles and his wife were visiting a family in Iqaluit and he asked for permission to have a <b>cup</b> of <b>orange</b> juice. This small gesture of asking was taken as offensive because Inuit do not consider food belonging to one person.|$|R

50|$|Leptopsammia pruvoti is {{a solitary}} stony coral and superficially resembles a sea anemone. The polyp {{sits in a}} {{calcareous}} cup, wider at the base than the top, which varies in shape from cylindrical and short to conical and long. It grows to a height of about 60 mm and a diameter of 20 mm. The polyp is yellow or orange with about ninety-six long, translucent yellow tentacles. It can retract back into the skeletal cup, so that the tentacles become barely visible. This species can be confused with another yellow or <b>orange</b> <b>cup</b> coral, Balanophyllia regia, but that species never grows so large and has fewer tentacles.|$|R
50|$|At lunch, Abe and Jill overhear a conversation; a {{woman says}} she will lose her {{children}} in a custody battle because of a seemingly unethical judge in family court. Abe is troubled by the injustice and, without telling Jill, decides to help the woman by murdering the judge. Abe reasons he's unlikely to be caught because he isn't {{involved in the case}} and, therefore, won't be suspected. Abe steals a key to the college's chemistry lab from Rita where he procures cyanide. He then discovers one of the judge's routines: an early morning jog followed by sipping a <b>cup</b> of <b>orange</b> juice on a bench in the local park. Abe puts the poison in an identical cup and exchanges the cups surreptitiously on the bench while the judge is reading a newspaper. He subsequently dies from cyanide poisoning. Abe feels reborn upon learning of the judge's death. He tells himself that he has finally done something worthwhile with his life by ridding the world of one evil man. Consequently, his mood improves dramatically. Abe and Jill's friendship then blossoms into a romance but Jill says nothing to her boyfriend, Roy (Jamie Blackley). However, Roy strongly suspects Jill is in love with Abe and breaks up with her.|$|R
