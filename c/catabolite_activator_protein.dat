50|$|The Mal regulon are set {{of genes}} excited by <b>catabolite</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> {{commonly}} known as CAP. The genes code for maltose metabolizing enzymes. The genes encoding the enzymes are non-contiguous, and regulated by multiple promoters. Mal regulon is regulated by <b>catabolite</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> in a novel manner. The Mal promoters are regulated by a protein called MalT that requires ATP and maltotriose to function. Maltotriose is a maltose regulon inducer. MalEp and malKp are examples of mal promoters that depends on both CAP and MalT to function while pulAp, pulCp and malPp are examples of mal promoters that depends on MalT only and malTp is controlled only be CAP.|$|E
50|$|Other {{regulatory}} genes {{code for}} activator proteins. An activator binds {{to a site}} on the DNA molecule and causes an increase in transcription of a nearby gene. In prokaryotes, a well-known activator protein is the <b>catabolite</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> or CAP, involved in positive control of the lac operon.|$|E
5000|$|... cAMP {{receptor}} protein (CRP; {{also known}} as <b>catabolite</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein,</b> CAP) is a regulatory protein in bacteria. CRP protein binds cAMP, which causes a conformational change that allows CRP to bind tightly to a specific DNA site in the promoters of the genes it controls. CRP then activates transcription through direct protein-protein interactions with RNA polymerase.|$|E
40|$|We {{isolated}} three Escherichia coli <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> mutants {{that are}} defective in the positive control of transcription initiation from the lac operon promoter region yet retain negative control of transcription from other promoters. One mutant has a substitution of valine for glutamate at residue 72, which {{lies in the}} cyclic AMP binding domain and contacts cyclic AMP. The other two mutants have substitutions of asparagine and cysteine for glycine 162, which lies in a surface-exposed turn of the DNA-binding domain. Surprisingly, although all three mutants can repress the lacP 2 /P 3 promoters through the <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> target site of lac, none displays strong dominance over the ability of wild-type <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> to stimulate the lacP 1 promoter...|$|R
40|$|In Escherichia coli {{there is}} a large {{increase}} of cAMP synthesis in crp strains, which are deficient in the <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein.</b> In this work it was shown that this increase in cAMP synthesis does not occur in crp crr strains, deficient in both the <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> and enzymeII 1 -glucose, a component of the phosphotransferase system. It was also shown that the other components of the phosphotransferase system are required to obtain the increase of CAMP synthesis in a crp background. Adenylate cyclase mutants were obtained, by random mutagenesis, which had partial adenylate cyclase activity but which did not exhibit increased levels of cAMP in a crp background. For three mutants the mutation was identified as a single point mutation. This allowed the identification of residues arginine 188, aspartic acid 414 and glycine 463 which could be involved in the <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> dependent activation process...|$|R
50|$|The {{recognition}} domain contains three subdomains (D1, D2 and D3) {{that are}} evolutionarily {{related to the}} DNA-binding domain of the <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> which contains a helix-turn-helix.|$|R
50|$|The cya gene encodes adenylate cyclase, which {{produces}} cAMP. In a cya mutant, {{the absence of}} cAMP makes {{the expression of the}} lacZYA genes more than ten times lower than normal. Addition of cAMP corrects the low Lac expression characteristic of cya mutants. The second gene, crp, encodes a protein called <b>catabolite</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> (CAP) or cAMP receptor protein (CRP).|$|E
50|$|The <b>catabolite</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> (CAP; {{also known}} as cAMP {{receptor}} protein, CRP) activates transcription at the lac operon of the bacterium Escherichia coli. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is produced during glucose starvation, binds to CAP, causes a conformational change that allows CAP to bind to a DNA site located adjacent to the lac promoter. CAP then makes a direct protein-protein interaction with RNA polymerase that recruits RNA polymerase to the lac promoter.|$|E
50|$|With the glucose {{phosphotransferase}} system, the phosphorylation {{status of}} EIIA can have regulatory functions. For example, at low glucose concentrations phosphorylated EIIA accumulates and this activates membrane-bound adenylate cyclase. Intracellular cyclic AMP levels rise and this then activates CAP (<b>catabolite</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein),</b> which {{is involved in}} the catabolite repression system, also known as glucose effect. When the glucose concentration is high, EIIA is mostly dephosphorylated and this allows it to inhibit adenylate cyclase, glycerol kinase, lactose permease, and maltose permease. Thus, as well as the PEP group translocation system being an efficient way to import substrates into the bacterium, it also links this transport to regulation of other relevant proteins.|$|E
40|$|The ets {{family of}} {{eukaryotic}} transcription factors {{is characterized by}} a conserved DNA-binding domain of approximately 85 amino acids for which the three-dimensional structure is not known. By using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, we have determined the secondary structure of the ets domain of one member of this gene family, human Fli- 1, both in the free form and in a complex with a 16 -bp cognate DNA site. The secondary structure of the Fli- 1 ets domain consists of three alpha-helices and a short four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. This secondary structure arrangement resembles that of the DNA-binding domain of the <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> of Escherichia coli, {{as well as those of}} several eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins including histone H 5, HNF- 3 /fork head, and the heat shock transcription factor. Differences in chemical shifts of backbone resonances and amide exchange rates between the DNA-bound and free forms of the Fli- 1 ets domain suggest that the third helix is the DNA recognition helix, as in the <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> and other structurally related proteins. These results suggest that the ets domain is structurally similar to the <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> family of helix-turn-helix DNA-binding proteins...|$|R
40|$|The Pasteurella multocida {{adenylate cyclase}} gene has been cloned and {{expressed}} in Escherichia coli. The primary {{structure of the}} protein (838 amino acids) deduced from the corresponding nucleotide sequence was {{compared with that of}} E. coli. The two enzymes have similar molecular sizes and, based on sequence conservation at the protein level, are likely to be organized in two functional domains: the amino-terminal catalytic domain and the carboxy-terminal regulatory domain. It was shown that P. multocida adenylate cyclase synthesizes increased levels of cyclic AMP in E. coli strains deficient in the <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> compared with wild-type strains. This increase does not occur in strains deficient in both the <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> and enzyme HI-glucose, indicating that a protein similar to E. coli enzyme III-glucose is involved in the regulation ofP. multocida adenylate cyclase. It also indicates that the underlying process leading to enterobacterial adenylate cyclase activation has been conserved through evolution. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) in Escherichia coli is known to play a regulatory role in gene transcription via its receptor <b>protein,</b> <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> (CAP) (25).

40|$|The Xanthomonas campestris <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> protein-like <b>protein</b> (CLP) can {{substitute}} for the Escherichia coli <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> (CAP) in transcription activation at the lac promoter (V. de Crecy-Lagard, P. Glaser, P. Lejeune, O. Sismeiro, C. Barber, M. Daniels, and A. Danchin, J. Bacteriol. 172 : 5877 - 5883, 1990). We show that CLP has the same DNA binding specificity as CAP at positions 5, 6, and 7 of the DNA half site. In addition, we show that the amino acids at positions 1 and 2 of the recognition helix of CLP are identical to the amino acids at positions 1 and 2 of the recognition helix of CAP:i. e., Arg at position 1 and Glu at position 2...|$|R
50|$|The second control {{mechanism}} {{is a response}} to glucose, which uses the <b>catabolite</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> (CAP) homodimer to greatly increase production of β-galactosidase in the absence of glucose. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a signal molecule whose prevalence is inversely proportional to that of glucose. It binds to the CAP, which in turn allows the CAP to bind to the CAP binding site (a 16 bp DNA sequence upstream of the promoter on the left in the diagram below, about 60 bp upstream of the transcription start site), which assists the RNAP in binding to the DNA. In the absence of glucose, the cAMP concentration is high and binding of CAP-cAMP to the DNA significantly increases the production of β-galactosidase, enabling the cell to hydrolyse lactose and release galactose and glucose.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of the {{bacterial}} diauxic shift from glucose to lactose metabolism, a proposed mechanism suggested that glucose initially inhibits the ability of the enzyme adenylate cyclase to synthesize cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP, in turn, is required for the <b>catabolite</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> (CAP) to bind to DNA and activate the transcription of the lac operon, which includes genes necessary for lactose metabolism. The presence of allolactose, a metabolic product of lactose, is sensed through the activity of the lac repressor, which inhibits transcription of the lac operon until lactose is present. Thus, if glucose is present, cAMP levels remain low, so CAP is unable to activate transcription of the lac operon, regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} lactose. Upon the exhaustion of the glucose supply, cAMP levels rise, allowing CAP to activate the genes necessary for the metabolism of other food sources, including lactose if it is present.|$|E
50|$|It {{would be}} {{wasteful}} {{to produce the}} enzymes {{when there is no}} lactose available or if there is a more preferable energy source available, such as glucose. The lac operon uses a two-part control mechanism to ensure that the cell expends energy producing the enzymes encoded by the lac operon only when necessary. In the absence of lactose, the lac repressor, lacI, halts production of the enzymes encoded by the lac operon. The lac repressor is always expressed unless a co-inducer binds to it. In other words, it is transcribed only in the presence of small molecule co-inducer. In the presence of glucose, the <b>catabolite</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> (CAP), required for production of the enzymes, remains inactive, and EIIAGlc shuts down lactose permease to prevent transport of lactose into the cell. This dual control mechanism causes the sequential utilization of glucose and lactose in two distinct growth phases, known as diauxie.|$|E
40|$|Sixty-two {{spontaneous}} mutations {{have been}} characterized which reduce {{the level of}} expression of catabolite-sensitive operons. These mutations appear to affect either the crp (<b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein)</b> or cya (adenyl cyclase) loci. No new loci have been discovered.

40|$|The <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> from Klebsiella aerogenes (CAPK) and the {{corresponding}} protein from Escherichia coli (CAPE) were shown to be nearly identical. Both CAPK and CAPE activated transcription from the CAP-dependent promoters derived from E. coli and K. aerogenes. The crp gene from K. aerogenes (encoding CAP) is tightly linked to rpsL. The nucleotide sequence of crp predicts an amino acid sequence for CAPK that differs in only one position from that of CAPE...|$|R
40|$|Colicinogenic factors ColE 1 and ColE 2 are {{bacterial}} plasmids {{that exist}} in Escherichia coli as supercoiled deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and as strand-specific, relaxation complexes of supercoiled DNA and protein. Newly replicated ColE 1 DNA becomes complexed with protein after the replication event. This association of DNA and protein can take place under conditions in which DNA or protein synthesis is arrested. The addition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP) to normal cells growing in glucose medium results in a six- to tenfold stimulation {{in the rate of}} synthesis of the protein component(s) of the complex and a three- to fivefold stimulation in the rate of ColE 1 DNA replication. Employing mutants deficient in <b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> or adenylate cyclase, it was shown that synthesis of both the plasmid-determined protein colicin E 1 and the protein component(s) of the ColE 1 relaxation complex is mediated through the c-AMP-catabolite gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> system. Addition of c-AMP to ColE 2 -containing cells results in the stimulation of synthesis of ColE 2 DNA and relaxation protein(s) {{as well as in the}} production of a protein component of the ColE 2 relaxation complex that renders it sensitive to induced relaxation by heat treatment.

50|$|The glnALG operon is {{regulated}} by an intricate network of repressors and activators. Along with NRI and NRII, there are gene products of glnF and glnD which {{play a key}} role in this network.The expression of the glnALG operon {{is regulated}} by the NRI at three promoters: glnAp1, glnAp2 and glnLp. The initiation of transcription at glnAp1 is stimulated exclusively under carbon starvation conditions and stationary phase during which cAMP accumulates in high concentration in the cell. The binding of cAMP to the <b>catabolite</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> (CAP) causes CAP to bind to a specific DNA site in glnAp1, and glnAp1 is repressed by NRI. Initiation of transcription at glnAp2 requires the activated form of NRI, i.e. NRI-P(phosphorylated NRI), as well as the glnF gene product, σ60 , and it is regulated by NRII. NRII in the presence of ATP, catalyzes the transfer of ϒ-phosphate of ATP to NRI. In the presence of PII, which is encoded by glnB, NRII catalyzes the dephosphorylation of NRI-P.|$|E
5000|$|Once the glucose is {{all used}} up, the second {{preferred}} carbon source (i.e. lactose) {{has to be}} used by bacteria. Absence of glucose will [...] "turn off" [...] catabolite repression. When glucose levels are low the phosphorylated form of EIIA accumulates and consequently activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which will produce high levels of cAMP. cAMP binds to <b>catabolite</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> (CAP) and together they will bind to a promoter sequence on the lac operon. However, this is not enough for the lactose genes to be transcribed. Lactose must be present inside the cell to remove the lactose repressor from the operator sequence (transcriptional regulation). When these two conditions are satisfied, it means for the bacteria that glucose is absent and lactose is available. Next, bacteria start to transcribe the lac operon and produce β-galactosidase enzymes for lactose metabolism. The example above is a simplification of a complex process. Catabolite repression {{is considered to be a}} part of global control system and therefore it affects more genes rather than just lactose gene transcription.|$|E
50|$|The {{central core}} of the protein {{contains}} a Toprim fold and a DNA-binding core that contains a winged helix domain (WHD), {{often referred to as}} a CAP domain, since it was first identified to resemble the WHD of <b>catabolite</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein.</b> The catalytic tyrosine lies on this WHD. The Toprim fold is a Rossmann fold that contains three invariant acidic residues that coordinate magnesium ions involved in DNA cleavage and DNA religation (Avarind, Leipe, Konin, Nucleic Acids Research 1998). The structure of the Toprim fold and DNA-binding core of yeast topoisomerase II was first solved by Berger and Wang (Nature 1996, PDB ID = 1BGW), and the first gyrase DNA-binding core was solved by Morais Cabral et al. (Nature 1997, PDB ID = 1AB4). The structure solved by Berger revealed important insights into the function of the enzyme. The DNA-binding core consists of the WHD, which leads to a tower domain. A coiled-coil region leads to a C-terminal domain that forms the main dimer interface for this crystal state (often termed the C-gate). While the original topoisomerase II structure shows a situation where the WHDs are separated by a large distance, the structure of gyrase shows a closed conformation, where the WHD close.|$|E

50|$|In bacteria, {{the level}} of cAMP varies {{depending}} on the medium used for growth. In particular, cAMP is low when glucose is the carbon source. This occurs through inhibition of the cAMP-producing enzyme, adenylate cyclase, as a side-effect of glucose transport into the cell. The transcription factor cAMP receptor protein (CRP) also called CAP (<b>catabolite</b> gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein)</b> forms a complex with cAMP and thereby is activated to bind to DNA. CRP-cAMP increases expression {{of a large number}} of genes, including some encoding enzymes that can supply energy independent of glucose.|$|R

Order of addition experiments are used to show that the binding of lac repressor to the operator is competitive with that of the RNA polymerase (nucleosidetriphosphate:RNA nucleotidyltransferase, EC 2. 7. 7. 6) to the promoter, thus demonstrating functional overlap of the operator and promoter sites...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Catabolite</b> <b>Activator</b> <b>Protein</b> (CAP; {{also known}} as cAMP {{receptor}} protein, CRP) is a trans-acting transcriptional activator that exists as a homodimer in solution. Each subunit of CAP is composed of a ligand-binding domain at the N-terminus (CAPN, residues 1-138) and a DNA-binding domain at the C-terminus (DBD, residues 139-209). Two cAMP (cyclic AMP) molecules bind dimeric CAP with negative cooperativity. Cyclic AMP functions as an allosteric effector by increasing CAP's affinity for DNA. CAP binds a DNA region upstream from the DNA binding site of RNA Polymerase. CAP activates transcription through protein-protein interactions with the α-subunit of RNA Polymerase. This protein-protein interaction is responsible for (i) catalyzing {{the formation of the}} RNAP-promoter closed complex; and (ii) isomerization of the RNAP-promoter complex to the open confirmation. CAP's interaction with RNA polymerase causes bending of the DNA near the transcription start site, thus effectively catalyzing the transcription initiation process. [...] CAP's name is derived from its ability to affect transcription of genes involved in many catabolic pathways. For example, when the amount of glucose transported into the cell is low, a cascade of events results in the increase of cytosolic cAMP levels. This increase in cAMP levels is sensed by CAP, which goes on to activate the transcription of many other catabolic genes.|$|E
5000|$|Specific {{control of}} the lac genes depends on the {{availability}} of the substrate lactose to the bacterium. The proteins are not produced by the bacterium when lactose is unavailable as a carbon source.The lac genes are organized into an operon; that is, they are oriented in the same direction immediately adjacent on the chromosome and are co-transcribed into a single polycistronic mRNA molecule. Transcription of all genes starts with the binding of the enzyme RNA polymerase (RNAP), a DNA-binding protein, which binds to a specific DNA binding site, the promoter, immediately upstream of the genes. Binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter is aided by the cAMP-bound <b>catabolite</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> (CAP, also known as the cAMP receptor protein). [...] However, the lacI gene (regulatory gene for lac operon) produces a protein that blocks RNAP from binding to the promoter of the operon. This protein can only be removed when allolactose binds to it, and inactivates it. The protein that is formed by the lacI gene is known as the lac repressor. The type of regulation that the lac operon undergoes is referred to as negative inducible, meaning that the gene is turned off by the regulatory factor (lac repressor) unless some molecule (lactose) is added. Because of the presence of the lac repressor protein, genetic engineers who replace the lacZ gene with another gene will have to grow the experimental bacteria on agar with lactose available on it. If they do not, the gene they are trying to express will not be expressed as the repressor protein is still blocking RNAP from binding to the promoter and transcribing the gene. Once the repressor is removed, RNAP then proceeds to transcribe all three genes (lacZYA) into mRNA. Each of the three genes on the mRNA strand has its own Shine-Dalgarno sequence, so the genes are independently translated. The DNA sequence of the E. coli lac operon, the lacZYA mRNA, and the lacI [...] genes are available from GenBank (view).|$|E
