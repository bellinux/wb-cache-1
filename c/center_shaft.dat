5|$|Prinzregent Luitpold was {{equipped}} with two sets of Parsons turbines on the outer shafts. It was intended that a single 12,000bhp Germania 6-cylinder 2-stroke diesel engine would drive the <b>center</b> <b>shaft.</b> However, the diesel power plant was not ready in time to be installed in Prinzregent Luitpold, so the ship sailed with only two shafts.

5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the König-class battleships would be powered by {{two sets of}} turbines on the outer shafts, while the <b>center</b> <b>shaft</b> would have utilized a MAN 6-cylinder 2-stroke diesel engine producing 12,000shp at 150rpm. Development of the diesel was protracted, however, and it was later decided that the diesel would be installed only in Grosser Kurfürst and Markgraf. Ultimately, the diesel was never installed {{in any of the}} König-class battleships. They were instead equipped with three sets of Parsons (König and Kronprinz), AEG-Vulcan (Grosser Kurfürst), or Bergmann (Markgraf) turbines driving 3.8m-wide three-bladed screws. Steam was supplied by three oil-fired and 12 coal-fired Schulz-Thornycroft boilers operating at up to 16atmospheres of pressure.|$|E

The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. At 16:19, Kaiserin was forced to temporarily stop the turbine on the <b>center</b> <b>shaft,</b> as the condenser had started leaking.

By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward {{the main body of the}} High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, the crew of the leading German battleship, , spotted both the IScouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port.
