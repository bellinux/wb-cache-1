Different kinds of immobilization are known. The paper describes the immobilization by dialysis-hollow-fibre-membranes. In this case the substrate flow continuously through the tube-side of the capillary membranes of the membrane reactor and the cut-off of the membrane is choosen so that the enzyme is immobilized in the extracapillary volume of the reactor. The substrate diffuses through the membrane into the enzyme solution caused by the driving concentration difference which is always guaranteed by the enzymatically catalyzed reaction. The products diffuses back into the tube-side of the capillary membrane. So, a simple continuous process is realized by equally favourable relation between membrane area and reactor volume. Especially f or this process developed membrane reactors are presented.

40|$|As {{the ice in}} the Arctic {{region is}} melting, new areas will open for oil {{exploration}} and production. These areas are however remote, with long sailing times from shore. In addition, the main warehouses of the oil companies {{are located in the}} southwestern part of Norway, thus increasing the transportation distances further. To operate, the offshore installations need a lot of equipment, some of which is absolutely necessary for the operation, so called mission critical equipment. This type of equipment have been the main focus in this thesis. When this type of equipment breaks down, or it is no longer needed, it is sent to one of the main warehouses for maintenance and recalibration. By storing spares of this equipment closer to the installation, response time when equipment breaks down is reduced. Three possible supply chain scenarios were created. The first scenario is the current scenario, where equipment is sent by trucks from one of the main warehouses and to the Hammerfest depot, from where it is shipped to the offshore installations by Platform Supply Vessels (PSVs). The two other scenarios utilize a offshore depot. The depot is assumed to be a converted bulk-carrier. In scenario 2 this depot vessel sails from Hammerfest, while in Scenario 3 it sails from one of the main warehouses. For scenario 2, the equipment is transported by truck to Hammerfest. For a <b>continous</b> <b>operation,</b> it was assumed that two vessels are needed. By setting an operability constraint the supply chain could be optimized with respect to costs. Operability is the percentage of time inventory of the equipment is present at the installation. Then, by combining the Genetic Algorithm in MATLAB with queueing theory, this optimization problem was solved. It was created as a closed queueing network, meaning that a finite population of customers travel inside the network. This was chosen {{due to the nature of}} the equipment studied. The steady state probabilities was calculated using Buzen s algorithm. Three demand cases were studied. The first case was low demand, where demand arises twice a year. In the medium demand case, demand arises every month. The final case, high demand, demand arises twice a month. In queueing theory, demand is modelled as arriving customers. In a closed queueing network where there are no customers arriving from outside the system, this arrival rate is equal to the service rate at the offshore installation. By varying the transportation costs for the system, an offshore depot vessel seemed more viable for the high demand case, thus preferring to allocate the inventory closer to the installation...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2013 Genel olarak güç sistemleri incelendiğinde, günümüzdeki teknolojik gelişmelere paralel olarak sisteme entegre olan nonlineer elemanlar aracılığıyla harmoniğin etkileri elektrik enerjisi üretim, iletim ve dağıtımında artarak devam etmektedir. İster nonlineer yük ister nonlineer kaynak olsun, sistem içerisinde doğrusal olmayan elemanın varlığı, elemanın karakteristiğine bağlı olarak akım veya gerilim harmoniklerine sebep olmaktadır. Elektrik mühendisliğinin temeli, verimlilik esasına dayanır ve bu sistem kararlılığı ile doğru orantılıdır. Sistemin kararlı bir Şekilde çalışabilmesi için bir durum da, elektrik sisteminin kabul edilebilir sınırlar içerisinde ve nominal çalışma değerlerinde olmasıdır. İlgili değerleri önemli ölçüde etkileyen ve rastlantısal sürece zemin hazırlayan harmonikler, işletme şartlarında meydana gelen durumlar incelenerek hazırlanan gerek ulusal gerek uluslararası {{standart}} ve yönetmeliklerle sınırlandırılmıştır. Bahse konu limitlere uyulmaması beraberinde cezai yaptırımları da getirmektedir. Sonuçta hem idari boyutuyla hem de teknik anlamda harmoniklerin elektrik güç sisteminden elimine edilmesi gereklidir. Bu kapsamda değerlendirildiğinde, harmonik filtre tasarımı kendi içinde opsiyonları olsa da kararlılık için zorunlu ihtiyaç haline gelmiştir. Bu amaçla, 2012 yılında resmi açılışı yapılarak işletmeye alınan Sarıyer-Çayırbaşı Karayolu Tünelinin elektrik sistemi harmonik analizi yönünden incelenmiştir. Elektrik güç sistemine ilişkin veriler ilgili enerji analizörlerinden elde edilmiş ve ayrıca tünele ait tüm elektromekanik sistemler SCADA sisteminden de incelenmiştir. Ölçüm değerlerinden varılan sonuca göre, düşük mertebeli harmonikler sistemde yer aldığından tek veya çift ayarlı pasif filtre kullanılması uygun görülerek tesise özel pasif filtrenin MATLAB simülasyonu ile tasarımı ve teorik uygulaması yapılmıştır. Tünele ilişkin elektrik sistemi, pasif filtre öncesi ve pasif filtre sonrası durumları karşılaştırılarak son durumun ilgili yönetmeliklere ve standartlara uygunluğu irdelenmiştir. İkinci olarak, tünele ilişkin tüm sistemlerin tek bir yerden kontrol edildiği SCADA sisteminin işletmeye getirdiği kolaylıklar ve özellikleri incelenmiŞtir. Özellikle tünel elektromekanik sistemlerinin tek bir yerden izleme, kontrol, veri toplama ve veri saklanması iŞlemlerinin yapılabilmesi tünel iŞletmesinde oldukça esnek bir çalıŞmaya zemin hazırlamaktadır. Tüm sistemlerin SCADA ile tam entegre çalıŞmasının, özellikle ilgili kontrol bölgesi ile kontrol edilen cihazlar arasındaki mesafenin büyük olduğu tünel iŞletmesinde hem fiziki anlamda enerji ve zaman kaybını azalttığı, hem de iŞletme anlamında pratik ve esnekliği sağladığı görülmüŞtür. Bu sayede personel ihtiyacının ve ilgili personellerin doğru zamanda ve doğru mekanda yer alabilmesi, personellerin etkin kullanımı gibi faydaları da mümkün kıldığı görülmüŞtür. Generally, when we {{search the}} electrical power system, harmonics on electrical systems are spreading and rising {{up because of}} growing usage of nonlinear loads. Harmonics effect not only power generation, transmission but also power distribution systems. Because, if the electrical system include either nonlinear source or nonlinear load, it causes voltage or current harmonics with respect to components characteristics. Firstly, {{one of the main}} topics of electrical engineering is efficiency. Likewise, it has a direct corelation with the power system stability. For the purpose of the power system stability, system components should run on the conditon that nominal process and acceptable workout interval. Harmonics which effect related values tremendously and manifest a stochastic process, limited with respect to related national and international standards. Exceeding standard limits comes with official penalties. As a result, harmonics should be eliminated at acceptable limits from the electrical system not only for administrative obligation but also for technical necessity. Secondly, harmonic filter design is a necessity for power system stability even if it has lots of options. For this purpose, Electrical system of Sarıyer-Çayırbaşı Road Tunnel which was opened at June 2012 is researched with respect to harmonic analysis fundamentals. Measurement values of the electrical power system are received from related energy analyzer. Also, whole tunnel electromechanical systems are researched from SCADA system. According to measurement values, single tuned passive harmonic filter is designed theoretically and simulated with MATLAB simulation program. As a result, comparison with passive filter included system and without filter is done and substantiated availability of the filter with respect to related national regulations and international standards. Moreover, whole existing tunnel electromechanical systems on Sarıyer – Çayırbaşı tunnel were explained, briefly. Especially, tunnel lighting and control system is the main system and have most <b>continous</b> <b>operation</b> with respect to other tunnel electromechanical systems. Technically, A PLC or a special lighting controller gets related and sensed values and it compares them to arrange the luminaries triggering according to required light levels. This system works based on CIE 88 standards to make the lighting level comfortable for the drivers. According to environmental lighting level at the outside the tubes, 5 lighting zones are dynamically arranged. It is accepted to apply 5 switching steps as 100 %; 75 %; 50 %; 25 %; and night time in Sarıyer - Çayırbaşı tunnel. The lighting luminaires can be installed in single roe or as two rows along side the tunnel. In single row application, preliminary calculation results show that uniformity is not as good as two rows application. Furthermore, maintenance of the luminaires is more difficult in single row application, since two of the lanes whole tunnel section must be closed to traffic during the maintenance. As a result it is decided on two rows of application in Sarıyer – Çayırbaşı tunnel. Another lighting system is safety lighting system. Safety lighting system is provided to allow a minimum visibility for tunnel users to evacuate the tunnel in their vehicles {{in the event of a}} breakdown of the power supply. To do this there are some methods. One of them is to connect some or all of the normal lighting luminaries to UPS. This was applied in Sarıyer – Çayırbaşı tunnel. In addition to this, the border line lighting with LED's so called “guidance lighting” is a very effective way of safety lighting. These are also very useful in the case of evacuation if there is smoke in the tunnel. Since their height level is very close to ground, lights cannot be affected by heavy smoke, so uni-colour (red) or bi-colour (red and white) LED road studs are proposed to apply for every 12 or 24 meters (compatible with the section lengths) at the right side of the traffic direction. Moreover, there are also evacuation lighting system. In order to give visual messages in static form to the tunnel users, the internally illuminated information signs are distributed which are named as evacuation along the tunnel tubes. These signs are illuminated always. Most of them are used only in emergency conditions while some of them are required in normal conditions also. Evacuation lighting, such as evacuation marker lights, at a height of no more than 1, 5 meter, is provided to guide tunnel users to evacuate the tunnel on foot, in the event of emergency. Furthermore, another vital tunnel electromechanical system is ventilation system. Longitudinal ventilation system and jetfans are used in the tunnel. Because there are two main aims. First one is to supply fresh air into the tunnel, second one is to smoke-out in the case of fire in the tunnel. There are many techniques and different types of applications of tunnel ventilation systems. The suitable system must be selected according to design criteria. On the other hand, CO (Carbonmonoxide) and VI (Visibility or dust particle) measurement devices are continuously check the levels of CO and dust particles inside the tunnel tube. Based on these dynamic values, if the predefined limits are reached then the related ventilation system will automatically operate to supply fresh air into the tunnel tube. For this process, usually PLC systems are used as a ventilation controller unit. The data collected by CO, Visibility and wind speed and direction devices is sent to the PLC as input to PLC. Then the PLC checks them if they are in the desired range or not. If the level of the toxic gases are higher than the predefined limits or the visibility range is less than to see the desired distance then the ventilation system must automatically start an action to supply fresh air into the tube meanwhile the same system sends away these toxic gases and dust particles outside the tube. By doing this the existing wind speed and direction is another base input to the system so that the system decides to thrust the toxic air to easiest direction. For some emergency cases like fire in the tunnel tubes, there must be an emergency manual control panels. These panels are in the PLC including scenarios. Relevant scenarios and the operations programmed into the PLC must be in contact with main SCADA system via telecontrol and networking system in the tunnel. So SCADA make it possible to operate and control all the system components from the main control centre. The SCADA collects data not only from ventilation sensors but from all other sensors in the tunnel. As a result SCADA scenarios must be detailed studied before the emergency conditions occur and the ventilation control is only one part of the whole control system of the tunnel and it must be fully integrated to SCADA to get better benefits. This is one of the most critical points of the tunnel safety and control: Integration. Moreover, other integrated system is CCTV and Video detection system in the tunnel. In fact CCTV system and AID (Automatic Incident Detection) system are so close and relative systems connected to each other. The most important point for the CCTV system is to cover the whole tunnel tube without leaving any “blind” point in the traffic area in the tunnel. So the exact locations of the cameras must be selected by considering the curves of the tunnel tube in terms of traffic view. According to this approach next camera must be located at just before the end point of the area of the view of the former camera. CCTV sytems camera equipment were located along the Sarıyer – Çayırbaşı tunnel at every 50 - 60 meters. Finally, for all integrated electromechanical systems at SCADA, there should be a control centre for monitoring, controlling and managing of the tunnel and the road connections. It must have modern and technologic features in a separate building or room. All the stuff in the center must have trained for operating and managing to the tunnel systems. Especially to view the CCTV system videos, to see the fire alarms, to run the special scenarios by operator command, whole system confirmations are needed. As a result, SCADA integration is a vital advantage for a road tunnel such as Sarıyer – Çayırbaşı not only to monitor, control, manage the integrated systems, but also to make a flexible operation control with effective usage of technical staff and to achieve electrical analysis.

In addition to the exploration and optimization of efficiency, temperature stability and {{maximum output power of}} multi-mode lasers especially methods for longitudinal and lateral mode stabilization of high power laser diodes have been investigated. Although often the focus of optimization is on the threshold current density, in this work the performance of the laser diode for an operation point around 1 Watt under <b>continous</b> wave <b>operation</b> is regarded as the figure of merit. It turns out that low carrier densities are key for an efficient reduction of the heterobarrier leakage currents. In addition, large optical cavity structures with low internal losses enable high external quantum efficiencies even for long cavities. Finally high laser effiency as well as an efficient cooling leads to a reduced temperature load for the devices.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{dynamics}} of localized structures in an inhomogeneous Swift-Hohenberg model describing pattern formation in the transverse plane of an optical cavity. This real order parameter equation is valid close to the second order critical point associated with bistability. The optical cavity is illuminated by an inhomogeneous spatial gaussian pumping beam, and subjected to time-delayed feedback. The gaussian injection beam breaks the translational symmetry of the system by exerting an attracting force on the localized structure. We show that the localized structure can be pinned {{to the center of}} the inhomogeneity, suppressing the delay-induced drift bifurcation that has been reported in the particular case where the injection is homogeneous, assumming a <b>continous</b> wave <b>operation.</b> Under an inhomogeneous spatial pumping beam, we perform the stability analysis of localized solutions to identify different instability regimes induced by time-delayed feedback. In particular, we predict the formation of two-arm spirals, as well as oscillating and depinning dynamics caused by the interplay of an attracting inhomogeneity and destabilizing time-delayed feedback. The transition from oscillating to depinning solutions is investigated by means of numerical continuation techniques. Analytically, we use two approaches based on either an order parameter equation, describing the dynamics of the localized structure in the vicinity of the Hopf bifurcation or an overdamped dynamics of a particle in a potential well generated by the inhomogeneity. In the later approach, the time-delayed feedback acts as a driving force...|$|R
40|$|Superconducting {{radio-frequency}} resonators {{made from}} niobium {{are an integral}} part ofmany accelerator projects. Their main advantage are the low ohmic losses resulting inthe possibility for a long pulse structure and high duty cycles up to <b>continous</b> wave (cw) <b>operation.</b> The European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL) and the International LinearCollider (ILC) are based on this technology. In some cases the resonators reach acceleratingelectric fields close to the theoretical limit of bulk niobium. Yet most resonatorsare limited at lower fields and mass production for large scale accelerator projects suffersfrom the spread in the achievable gradient per resonator. The main limitations arefield emission and the breakdown of superconductivity (quench). While field emissionis mostly attributed to the overall surface cleanliness of the resonator, quench is usuallyassociated with local defects. Optical inspection of the inner surface of the resonators with unprecedented resolution,accuracy and a special illumination has been established at DESY and used to study suchlocal surface defects. More than 30 resonators have been inspected. Distinctive featuresfrom these inspections have been catalogued and assessed for their potential risk for theperformance of the resonator. Several confirmed quenching defects could be extracted forfurther analysis and could be traced back to likely origins in the production process. A new, automated set-up for optical inspection of large series of resonators, namedOBACHT, has been developed and successfully commissioned. Its design includes theminimal need for operator interference, reproducibility, robustness and versatility, in orderto fit the requirements for application both in a laboratory and in a production environment. To facilitate the comparison of the results obtained during the global R&D effort on resonatorsfor the ILC, the ILC global yield database has been established. The yield andselection rules for the resonators have been defined and the ILC yield database has servedas a tool to monitor the progress of the ILC R&D program...|$|R
