5|$|Photochromic lenses include silver halides, so that {{ultraviolet}} light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films {{are used in}} radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. <b>Colloidal</b> silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it {{has the advantage of}} not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, <b>colloidal</b> silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{compounds}} {{have low}} toxicity {{compared to those}} of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by metallothionein. However, silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, and respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with <b>colloidal</b> silver have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered <b>colloidal</b> silver causes acute silver poisoning. Some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts {{and those of the}} other precious metals; in most situations, however, silver does not pose serious environmental hazards.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam regular {{release and}} orally {{disintegrating}} tablets are available as 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, and 2mg tablets, while extended release tablets are available as 0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg, and 3mg. Alprazolam oral solutions are available as 0.5mg/5 mL and as 1mg/1 mL oral solutions. Inactive ingredients in alprazolam tablets and solutions include microcrystalline cellulose, corn starch, docusate sodium, povidone, sodium starch glycollate, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, <b>colloidal</b> silicon dioxide, and sodium benzoate. In addition, the 0.25mg tablet contains D Yellow No. 10 and the 0.5mg tablet contains FD Yellow No. 6 and D Yellow No. 10.|$|E
5|$|Helium–cadmium lasers are {{a common}} source of blue-ultraviolet laser light. They operate at either 325 or 422nm in {{fluorescence}} microscopes and various laboratory experiments. Cadmium selenide quantum dots emit bright luminescence under UV excitation (He-Cd laser, for example). The color of this luminescence can be green, yellow or red depending on the particle size. <b>Colloidal</b> solutions of those particles are used for imaging of biological tissues and solutions with a fluorescence microscope.|$|E
5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is {{a simple way to}} control the concentration and ionic strength. The concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties, including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased ionic strength reduces the thickness of the electrical double layer around <b>colloidal</b> particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{consists}} of a waxy <b>colloidal</b> emulsion, a substance composed {{of a number of}} partially immiscible liquids and solids mixed together. It is usually made from ingredients including some or all of naphtha, lanolin, turpentine, wax (often Carnauba wax), gum arabic, ethylene glycol, and if required a colourant, such as carbon black or an azo dye (such as aniline yellow). It typically has a specific gravity of 0.8, is negligibly soluble in water, and is made of between 65 and 77% volatile substances—usually naphtha. The high amount of volatile substances means that the shoe polish will dry out and harden after application, while retaining its shine.|$|E
25|$|Condensation {{of small}} {{dissolved}} molecules into larger <b>colloidal</b> particles by precipitation, condensation, or redox reactions. Such processes {{are used in}} the preparation of <b>colloidal</b> silica or gold.|$|E
25|$|Addition of a charged polymer flocculant. Polymer flocculants can bridge {{individual}} <b>colloidal</b> particles by attractive electrostatic interactions. For example, {{negatively charged}} <b>colloidal</b> silica or clay particles can be flocculated {{by the addition}} of a positively charged polymer.|$|E
25|$|Unstable <b>colloidal</b> {{suspensions}} of low-volume fraction form clustered liquid suspensions, wherein individual {{clusters of}} particles {{fall to the}} bottom of the suspension (or float to the top if the particles are less dense than the suspending medium) once the clusters are of sufficient size for the Brownian forces that work to keep the particles in suspension to be overcome by gravitational forces. However, <b>colloidal</b> suspensions of higher-volume fraction form <b>colloidal</b> gels with viscoelastic properties. Viscoelastic <b>colloidal</b> gels, such as bentonite and toothpaste, flow like liquids under shear, but maintain their shape when shear is removed. It is for this reason that toothpaste can be squeezed from a toothpaste tube, but stays on the toothbrush after it is applied.|$|E
25|$|In physics, colloids are an {{interesting}} model system for atoms. Micrometre-scale <b>colloidal</b> particles are {{large enough to be}} observed by optical techniques such as confocal microscopy. Many of the forces that govern the structure and behavior of matter, such as excluded volume interactions or electrostatic forces, govern the structure and behavior of <b>colloidal</b> suspensions. For example, the same techniques used to model ideal gases can be applied to model the behavior of a hard sphere <b>colloidal</b> suspension. In addition, phase transitions in <b>colloidal</b> suspensions can be studied in real time using optical techniques, and are analogous to phase transitions in liquids. In many interesting cases optical fluidity is used to control colloid suspensions.|$|E
25|$|Monodisperse powders of <b>colloidal</b> silica, for example, may {{therefore}} be stabilized sufficiently {{to ensure a}} high degree of order in the <b>colloidal</b> crystal or polycrystalline <b>colloidal</b> solid which results from aggregation. The degree of order appears to be limited by the time and space allowed for longer-range correlations to be established. Such defective polycrystalline structures would appear to be the basic elements of nanoscale materials science, and, therefore, provide the first step in developing a more rigorous understanding of the mechanisms involved in microstructural evolution in inorganic systems such as sintered ceramic nanomaterials.|$|E
25|$|Concentrated <b>colloidal</b> {{suspensions}} may {{exhibit a}} distinct glass transition as function of particle concentration or density.|$|E
25|$|The {{stability}} of a <b>colloidal</b> system {{is defined by}} particles remaining suspended in solution at equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|<b>Colloidal</b> {{suspensions}} are {{the subject}} of interface and colloid science. This field of study was introduced in 1861 by Scottish scientist Thomas Graham.|$|E
25|$|Dispersion {{of large}} {{particles}} or droplets to the <b>colloidal</b> dimensions by milling, spraying, or application of shear (e.g., shaking, mixing, or high shear mixing).|$|E
25|$|Water {{extracts}} of {{this species}} {{have been shown to}} have a potent protective effect on genotoxicity caused by bismuth compounds such as <b>colloidal</b> bismuth subcitrate.|$|E
25|$|Springtails {{commonly}} consume fungal hyphae and spores, {{but also}} {{have been found to}} consume plant material and pollen, animal remains, <b>colloidal</b> materials, minerals and bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Self-organization in {{chemistry}} includes molecular self-assembly, reaction-diffusion systems and oscillating reactions, autocatalytic networks, liquid crystals, grid complexes, <b>colloidal</b> crystals, self-assembled monolayers, micelles, microphase separation of block copolymers, and Langmuir-Blodgett films.|$|E
25|$|The method {{consists}} in {{adding to the}} <b>colloidal</b> suspension a polymer able to form a gel network and characterized by shear thinning properties. Examples of such substances are xanthan and guar gum.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the size}} of the {{dispersed}} phase may be difficult to measure, and because colloids have the appearance of solutions, colloids are sometimes identified and characterized by their physico-chemical and transport properties. For example, if a colloid consists of a solid phase dispersed in a liquid, the solid particles will not diffuse through a membrane, whereas with a true solution the dissolved ions or molecules will diffuse through a membrane. Because of the size exclusion, the <b>colloidal</b> particles are unable to pass through the pores of an ultrafiltration membrane with a size smaller than their own dimension. The smaller {{the size of}} the pore of the ultrafiltration membrane, the lower the concentration of the dispersed <b>colloidal</b> particles remaining in the ultrafiltered liquid. The measured value of the concentration of a truly dissolved species will thus depend on the experimental conditions applied to separate it from the <b>colloidal</b> particles also dispersed in the liquid. This is particularly important for solubility studies of readily hydrolyzed species such as Al, Eu, Am, Cm, or organic matter complexing these species.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{natural process}} of cement {{hydration}} with formation of <b>colloidal</b> globules about 5nm in diameter spreads into the entire volume of cement – water matrix as the energy expended upon the mix approaches and exceeds 5000 joules per kilogram.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{amphotericin}} B desoxycholate (AmB: {{used since}} the 1950s {{as a primary}} agent) {{is known to be}} associated with increased drug-induced Nephrotoxicity (Renal toxicity) impairing Renal function. Other formulations have been developed such as lipid soluble formulations to mitigate such side-effects as direct proximal and distal tubular cytotoxicity. These include liposomal amphotericin B, amphotericin B lipid complex such as Abelcet (brand) amphotericin B phospholipid complex also as AmBisome Intravenous, or Amphotec Intravenous (Generic; Amphotericin B Cholesteryl Sul) and, amphotericin B <b>colloidal</b> dispersion, all shown to exhibit a decrease in nephrotoxicity. The later was not as effective in one study as amphotericin B desoxycholate which had a 50% murine morbidity rate versus zero for the AmB <b>colloidal</b> dispersion.|$|E
25|$|Production of nano-particles can be {{performed}} chemically by taking for example mixtures of FeII and FeIII salts and mixing them with alkali to precipitate <b>colloidal</b> Fe3O4. The reaction conditions are critical to the process and determine the particle size.|$|E
25|$|Electrostatic interaction: <b>Colloidal</b> {{particles}} often {{carry an}} electrical charge and therefore attract or repel each other. The charge {{of both the}} continuous and the dispersed phase, {{as well as the}} mobility of the phases are factors affecting this interaction.|$|E
25|$|Silica is {{a common}} {{additive}} in food production, where it is used primarily as a flow agent in powdered foods, or to adsorb water in hygroscopic applications. It is the primary component of diatomaceous earth. <b>Colloidal</b> silica is also used as a wine, beer, and juice fining agent.|$|E
25|$|In cell biology, {{there is}} recent {{evidence}} suggesting that the cytoplasm behaves like a <b>colloidal</b> glass approaching the liquid-glass transition. During periods of low metabolic activity, as in dormancy, the cytoplasm vitrifies and prohibits the movement to larger cytoplasmic particles while allowing the diffusion of smaller ones throughout the cell.|$|E
25|$|Silver nitrate {{was one of}} {{the widely}} used drugs in the 19th century. However, It became {{replaced}} by Protargol. Arthur Eichengrün invented this type of <b>colloidal</b> silver, which was marketed by Bayer from 1897 on. The silver-based treatment was used until the first antibiotics came into use in the 1940s.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, K. Ladavac et al. used a spatial light {{modulator}} to project an intensity pattern to enable the optical sorting process. K. Xiao and D. G. Grier applied holographic video microscopy to demonstrate that this technique can sort <b>colloidal</b> spheres with part-per-thousand resolution for size and refractive index.|$|E
25|$|Under certain {{chemical}} conditions (typically in base-catalyzed sols), {{the particles}} may grow to sufficient size to become colloids, which are affected both by sedimentation and forces of gravity. Stabilized suspensions of such sub-micrometre spherical particles may eventually result in their self-assembly—yielding highly ordered microstructures {{reminiscent of the}} prototype <b>colloidal</b> crystal: precious opal.|$|E
25|$|Xu, using atomic force microscopy, {{has shown}} that {{formation}} of amyloid fibers is a two-step process in which proteins first aggregate into <b>colloidal</b> spheres of ~20nm diameter. The spheres then join together spontaneously to form linear chains, which evolve into mature amyloid fibers. The formation of these linear chains appears {{to be driven by}} the development of an electrostatic dipole in each of the <b>colloidal</b> spheres strong enough to overcome coulomb repulsion. This suggests a possible mechanism by which alpha sheet may promote amyloid aggregation; the peptide bond has a relatively large intrinsic electrostatic dipole, but normally the dipoles of nearby bonds cancel each other out. In the alpha sheet, unlike other conformations, the peptide bonds are oriented in parallel so that the dipoles of the individual bonds can add up to create a strong overall electrostatic dipole.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{cellulose}} nitrate, B-72 {{does not}} need additives like plasticizers to stabilize its durability. Fumed <b>colloidal</b> silica is a chemical that {{can be added to}} help with the workability of the resin. Additionally research shows that the silica will better distribute stress and strain that occurs during evaporation of the solvent and during the setting of the adhesive film.|$|E
25|$|Alkyl {{naphthalene}} sulfonates (ANS) {{are used}} in many industrial applications as nondetergent wetting agents that effectively disperse <b>colloidal</b> systems in aqueous media. The major commercial applications are in the agricultural chemical industry, which uses ANS for wettable powder and wettable granular (dry-flowable) formulations, and the textile and fabric industry, which utilizes the wetting and defoaming properties of ANS for bleaching and dyeing operations.|$|E
25|$|In {{materials}} science, the {{sol-gel process}} is a method for producing solid materials from small molecules. The method {{is used for the}} fabrication of metal oxides, especially the oxides of silicon and titanium. The process involves conversion of monomers into a <b>colloidal</b> solution (sol) that acts as the precursor for an integrated network (or gel) of either discrete particles or network polymers. Typical precursors are metal alkoxides.|$|E
25|$|Unordered topographies are {{generally}} created by processes that occur spontaneously during other processing; the patterns are random in orientation and organization with imprecise or {{no control over}} feature geometry. The advantage to creating unordered topographies over ordered is that the processes are often less time consuming, less expensive, and do not require great skill and experience. Unordered topographies can be created by polymer demixing, <b>colloidal</b> lithography and chemical etching.|$|E
25|$|A <b>colloidal</b> crystal is {{a highly}} ordered array of {{particles}} that forms over a long range (from a few millimeters to one centimeter in length); <b>colloidal</b> crystals have appearance and properties roughly analogous to their atomic or molecular counterparts. It {{has been known for}} many years that, due to repulsive Coulombic interactions, electrically charged macromolecules in an aqueous environment can exhibit long-range crystal-like correlations, with interparticle separation distances often being considerably greater than the individual particle diameter. Periodic arrays of spherical particles give rise to interstitial voids (the spaces between the particles), which act as a natural diffraction grating for visible light waves, when the interstitial spacing is of the same order of magnitude as the incident lightwave. In these cases in nature, brilliant iridescence (or play of colours) is attributed to the diffraction and constructive interference of visible lightwaves according to Bragg’s law, in a matter analogous to the scattering of X-rays in crystalline solid. The effects occur at visible wavelengths because the separation parameter d is much larger than for true crystals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Colloidal</b> {{suspensions}} of nanoparticles of {{boric acid}} dissolved in petroleum {{or vegetable oil}} can form a remarkable lubricant on ceramic or metal surfaces with a coefficient of sliding friction that decreases with increasing pressure to a value ranging from 0.10 to 0.02. Self-lubricating H3BO3 films result from a spontaneous chemical reaction between water molecules and B2O3 coatings in a humid environment. In bulk-scale, an inverse relationship exists between friction coefficient and Hertzian contact pressure induced by applied load.|$|E
