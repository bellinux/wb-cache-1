5|$|In 1952, the Technicolor Corporation <b>contracted</b> <b>with</b> SRI {{to develop}} a near-instantaneous, {{electro-optical}} alternative to the manual process of timing during film copying. In 1959, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented the Scientific and Engineering Award jointly to SRI and Technicolor for their work on the design {{and development of the}} Technicolor electronic printing timer which greatly benefited the motion picture industry. In 1954, Southern Pacific asked SRI to investigate ways of reducing damage during rail freight shipments by mitigating shock to railroad box cars. This investigation led to William K. MacCurdy's development of the Hydra-Cushion technology, which remains standard today.|$|E

5|$|The Killer was {{not able}} to be filmed until actor Chow Yun-fat stepped in and enlisted the company he was <b>contracted</b> <b>with,</b> Golden Princess Film, to fund part of the project. Chow had worked {{previously}} with Woo on the two A Better Tomorrow films. Woo wanted Danny Lee to play Li Ying, but Lee was under an exclusive contract with Cinema City and was only able to work on The Killer if his production company, Magnum, was involved. John Woo approached his friend, Sally Yeh, asking her to be in a film to play an important female character. Yeh was currently <b>contracted</b> <b>with</b> Tsui Hark and accepted the role but later felt she did not give her best performance. The supporting roles were filled out by friends of the actors and director. Chu Kong was a friend of Chow Yun-fat who had entered retirement and returned to acting in The Killer as a favor. Two of Woo's close friends joined the cast: actor Kenneth Tsang and screenwriter Barry Wong. Wong Wing-Hang was hired to be the director of photography for The Killer but had to leave the set {{for an extended period of}} time, so Peter Pau was added to shoot the rest of the film.|$|E
5|$|Throughout her career, Godwin worked {{consistently}} {{with her}} agent, John Hawkins, but worked with several different publishing houses. Godwin's early books were published by Knopf. After the editor for The Perfectionists, David Segal, died suddenly {{of a heart}} attack, Robert Gottlieb from Knopf became her editor for her next four books. Godwin credits Gottlieb {{for much of the}} success of her early works. Later on, when Godwin's then-recent books were less widely read, USA Today commented that this could be in part because she was no longer working with Gottlieb. After Knopf, Godwin <b>contracted</b> <b>with</b> Viking, who offered larger advances and more publicity for her books.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{experienced}} some tax trouble with federal authorities, concerning the financial relationship {{between himself and}} his company. In November 1918, he <b>contracted</b> <b>with</b> the company {{for the use of}} his trade secrets in the manufacture of the coffee, and a month later gave a four-fifths stake in this to his immediate family. The Washingtons insisted that taxes needn't be paid on the family members' income, and the case went first to the Board of Tax Appeals, and then to the Court of Appeals, which in 1927 ruled against the Washingtons by a two-to-one decision. A petition to the Supreme Court was not accepted.|$|E

5|$|While Roman {{emperors}} {{almost always}} married wives {{who were also}} Roman citizens, the ruling families of the empire's client kingdoms in the Near East and North Africa often contracted marriages with other royal houses to consolidate their position. These marriages were often <b>contracted</b> <b>with</b> the approval, or even at the behest, of the Roman emperors themselves. Rome thought that such marriages promoted stability among their client states and prevented petty local wars that would disturb the Pax Romana. Glaphyra of Cappadocia was known to have contracted three such royal intermarriages: with Juba II, King of Numidia and Mauretania, Alexander of Judea and Herod Archelaus, Ethnarch of Samaria.|$|E
5|$|With this vote-of-confidence in place, BTF <b>contracted</b> <b>with</b> an {{independent}} maritime engineering firm {{to make a}} survey of the ship to determine her condition. If the ship is not structurally sound enough to support herself when permanently resting on keel blocks, then the question of dry berthing would be moot. The survey reflected that, although her hull leaks, her keel and main supporting internal structure is sufficiently strong to support the weight of the ship in a dry berth.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Insight Bowl <b>contracted</b> <b>with</b> the Big East {{conference and}} Pacific-10 conference to select teams for {{participation}} in its annual game. Big East champion Miami was awarded an automatic Bowl Championship Series berth, and second-place Pittsburgh accepted a bid to the Continental Tire Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina. Continental Tire Bowl officials considered inviting Virginia Tech {{to participate in the}} game, but were required to invite Virginia due to the Continental Tire Bowl's contract with the Atlantic Coast Conference. Rather than selecting two teams that faced each other in the final game of the regular season, Continental Bowl officials chose another team. The other possibility for the Hokies was the San Francisco Bowl, whose managers also held a contract with the Big East, but because Tech played in the previous year's San Francisco Bowl, the bowl's organizing committee decided against a second invitation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Disney <b>contracted</b> <b>with</b> the Stratemeyer Syndicate and Grosset & Dunlap to produce two Hardy Boys TV serials, {{starring}} Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk. The {{first of the}} serials, The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure, was aired on The Mickey Mouse Club in 1956 during the show's second season. To appeal to the show's audience, the Hardy Boys were portrayed as younger than in the books, seeming to be twelve or thirteenyears old (Considine was 15 and Kirk was 14 during filming). The script, written by Jackson Gillis, {{was based on the}} first Hardy Boys book, The Tower Treasure, and the serial was aired in 19episodes of fifteen minutes each with production costs of $5,700. A second serial, The Mystery of Ghost Farm, followed in 1957, with an original story by Jackson Gillis. However, for unknown reasons, no more serials were produced.|$|E
5|$|No {{immediate}} action {{had been taken}} after the 1880 act authorizing coins, but King Kalākaua was interested and government officials saw {{a way to get}} out of a financial bind by getting coins issued in exchange for government bonds. Businessman Claus Spreckels was willing to make the arrangements with the United States in exchange for profits from the coin production, and <b>contracted</b> <b>with</b> the US Mint to have $1,000,000 struck. Originally, a 12 cent piece was planned and a few specimens were struck, but it was scrapped in an effort to have uniformity between US and Hawaiian coins, and a dime was substituted. The coins were struck at San Francisco in 1883 and 1884, though all bear the earlier date.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{work had}} begun well before that date, however, and Ericsson's {{consortium}} <b>contracted</b> <b>with</b> Thomas R. Rowland of the Continental Iron Works at Greenpoint, Brooklyn on 25 October {{for construction of}} Monitors hull, with her keel being laid on that same day. The turret was built and assembled at the Novelty Iron Works in Manhattan, disassembled and shipped to Greenpoint where it was reassembled. The ship's steam engines and machinery were constructed at the DeLamater Iron Works, also in Manhattan. Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers, who once served aboard Merrimack, was appointed Superintendent of the ship while she was undergoing construction. Although never formally assigned to the crew, he remained aboard her as an inspector during her maiden voyage and battle.|$|E

5|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) <b>contracted</b> <b>with</b> British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) in 1997 {{to decontaminate}} and {{decommission}} the facilities. Its subsidiary Reactor Sites Management Company Limited (RSMC) {{was acquired by}} EnergySolutions in June 2007. Initially K-29, K-31 and K-33 were to be retained for other uses, but it was subsequently decided to demolish them. Bechtel Jacobs, the environmental management contractor, assumed responsibility for the facility in July 2005. Demolition of K-29 began in January 2006, and was completed in August. Demolition of K-33 began in January 2011, and was completed ahead of schedule in September 2011.

5|$|The {{datalink}} for Malaysia Airline's avionics {{communications at}} the time of the incident was supplied by SITA, which <b>contracted</b> <b>with</b> Inmarsat to provide a satellite communication link using Inmarsat's Classic Aero service. Aeronautical satellite communication (SATCOM) systems are used to transmit messages from the aircraft cockpit as well as automated messages from on-board systems using the ACARS communications protocol, but may also be used to transmit FANS and ATN messages and provide voice, fax, and data links using other protocols. An appropriate comparison of ACARS' relationship to the SATCOM system is that of a messaging application to a smartphone; the smartphone functions and will remain registered on a mobile phone network even if the messaging application is closed.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1984 Winter Olympics, {{a dispute}} formed over what made a player a professional. The IOC had adopted {{a rule that}} made any player who had signed an NHL {{contract}} but played less than ten games in the league eligible. However, the United States Olympic Committee maintained that any player <b>contracted</b> <b>with</b> an NHL team was a professional and therefore not eligible to play. The IOC held an emergency meeting that ruled NHL-contracted players were eligible, {{as long as they}} had not played in any NHL games. This made five players on Olympic rosters—one Austrian, two Italians and two Canadians—ineligible. Players who had played in other professional leagues—such as the World Hockey Association—were allowed to play. Canadian hockey official Alan Eagleson stated that the rule was only applied to the NHL and that professionally contracted players in European leagues were still considered amateurs. Murray Costello of the CAHA suggested that a Canadian withdrawal was possible. In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games starting in 1988, but let the individual sport federations decide if they wanted to allow professionals.|$|E
