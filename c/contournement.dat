5000|$|The <b>Contournement</b> Nîmes-Montpellier (English: [...] "Nîmes - Montpellier Bypass") is a {{high-speed}} railway line under construction, bypassing {{the cities of}} Nîmes and Montpellier in southern France.|$|E
50|$|The A26 will be {{extended}} to Auxerre after 2025. and perhaps to Bourges thereafter {{but that is not}} programmed before 2030. It would, if completed, replace N77 and N151 as part of the second version of the Grand <b>contournement</b> de Paris.|$|E
5000|$|A52 - Grand <b>Contournement</b> de Marseille [...] "Marseilles Bypass". The {{motorway}} {{starts at}} the A8/A52 junction in the Aix Est (La Barque). It is a mountain 2x2 motorway built at 20 km around Marseilles. After the A52/A520 junction and Pont de l'Etoile, it ends at Aubagne, connected with A501 and A50.|$|E
50|$|The LGV Sud Europe Atlantique is a {{high-speed}} railway line planned for construction between the French cities of Montpellier and Perpignan, at which points they will {{link with the}} <b>Contournement</b> Nîmes - Montpellier and LGV Perpignan-Figueres. Two new stations will be constructed {{as part of the}} project in Béziers and Narbonne. Montpellier-Béziers and Rivesaltes-Toulouges will be for mixed traffic, with Béziers-Toulouges being for passenger traffic only.|$|E
50|$|Château Cantemerle, {{particularly}} {{its director}} Philippe Dambrine, were in ardent {{opposition to a}} plan by the French government to build a Grand <b>Contournement</b> road that was {{to pass through the}} Médoc as well as Côtes de Bourg and Blaye. The plan, which was initially approved in 2004, would have included construction that divided Château Cantemerle's vineyards in half. (Some versions of the plan would have called for the demolition of the estate itself) As of March 2007, there have been no further development on the plans.|$|E
50|$|At {{present the}} A35 autoroute, which {{parallels}} the Rhine between Karlsruhe and Basel, and the A4 autoroute, which links Paris with Strasbourg, penetrate {{close to the}} centre of the city. The Grand <b>contournement</b> ouest (GCO) project, programmed since 1999, plans to construct a 24 km highway connection between the junctions of the A4 and the A35 autoroutes in the north and of the A35 and A352 autoroutes in the south. This routes well {{to the west of the}} city and is meant to divest a significant portion of motorized traffic from the unité urbaine.|$|E

L'OBJECTIF DE MA THESE ETAIT D'IDENTIFIER DES RESEAUX FONCTIONNELS CONTRIBUANT A LA RESISTANCE INNEE DES TUMEURS. LES PROFILS D'EXPRESSION D'ECHANTILLONS DE TUMEURS ET METASTASES DE 13 PATIENTS ATTEINTS DE CANCER COLORECTAL AVANCE ONT ETE COLLECTES A L'AIDE DE MICRORESEAUX D'ADNC AVANT LEUR EXPOSITION A UNE CHIMIOTHERAPIE COMBINEE. DES PROCEDURES EXPERIMENTALES ET ANALYTIQUES ONT ETE MISES EN PLACE POUR OBTENIR DES DONNEES PRECISES ET DOCUMENTEES. UN SCHEMA EXPERIMENTAL SOIGNE A PERMIS DE LIMITER LES RESULTATS FAUSSEMENT POSITIFS ET NEGATIFS. 679 GENES DIFFERENTIELLEMENT EXPRIMES EN RELATION AVEC LES REPONSES A LA CHIMIOTHERAPIE ONT ETE SELECTIONNES. LES RESULTATS ONT ETE VERIFIES ET VALIDES PAR RT-PCR QUANTITATIVE SUR LES ECHANTILLONS DE L'ETUDE ET DEUX NOUVEAUX ECHANTILLONS. L'ANNOTATION FONCTIONNELLE DES GENES SELECTIONNES A PERMIS DE DETERMINER LES PROCESSUS BIOLOGIQUES ET COMPOSANTS CELLULAIRES ASSOCIES. UNE CARTE DES RESEAUX FONCTIONNELS A ETE CONSTRUITE A L'AIDE D'UN LANGAGE DE MODELISATION SYSTEMIQUE, PERMETTANT DE FORMULER DES HYPOTHESES SUR LES MECANISMES SOUS-JACENTS. UNE CELLULE RESISTANTE SE DIVISERAIT PEU, REPARERAIT RAPIDEMENT LES DOMMAGES CAUSES A SON ADN, PRESENTERAIT UNE AUGMENTATION DE L'EFFLUX DES DROGUES ET UNE MATRICE EXTRACELLULAIRE FIGEE. DEUX GROUPES DE GENES PREDICTEURS DE LA REPONSE A LA CHIMIOTHERAPIE ONT ETE SELECTIONNES. CES RESULTATS POURRONT SERVIR DE BASE POUR FACILITER LE <b>CONTOURNEMENT</b> DE LA RESISTANCE PAR LE DIAGNOSTIC ET LA MISE EN ŒUVRE DE NOUVELLES STRATEGIES THERAPEUTIQUES. COLORECTAL CANCER IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF DEATH IN WESTERN COUNTRIES. IN SPITE OF THE USE OF NEW MOLECULES, RESISTANCE TO THE TREATMENTS IS IMPORTANT UPON FIRST EXPOSURE TO CHEMOTHERAPY. THE OBJECTIVE OF MY THESIS WAS TO IDENTIFY FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS CONTRIBUTING TO INNATE RESISTANCE OF THE TUMOURS. EXPRESSION PROFILES OF TUMOR AND METASTASIS SAMPLES FROM 13 PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED COLORECTAL CANCER WERE COLLECTED USING CDNA MICROARRAYS BEFORE EXPOSURE OF THE PATIENTS TO A COMBINED CHEMOTHERAPY. EXPERIMENTAL AND ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES WERE ESTABLISHED TO OBTAIN PRECISE AND HIGHLY DOCUMENTED DATA. A CAREFUL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN ALLOWED LIMITING FALSELY POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE DIFFERENTIAL HYBRIDIZATION RESULTS. A LIST OF 679 GENES DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED IN RELATION WITH RESPONSES TO CHEMOTHERAPY WAS ESTABLISHED. THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN VERIFIED AND VALIDATED BY QUANTITATIVE RT-PCR ON THE SAMPLES INVESTIGATED AND TWO NOVEL SAMPLES WHOSE PHENOTYPE WAS CORRECTLY CHARACTERIZED. FUNCTIONAL ANNOTATION OF THE SELECTED GENES MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND CELLULAR COMPONENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. A MAP OF FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS WAS CONSTRUCTED USING A SYSTEMS BIOLOGY LANGUAGE. IT ALLOWED FORMULATION OF HYPOTHESES ON UNDERLYING MECHANISMS. A RESISTANT CELL WOULD DIVIDE POORLY, WOULD RAPIDLY REPAIR DAMAGES CAUSED TO ITS DNA, AND WOULD PRESENT AN INCREASED DRUG EFFLUX AND A FROZEN EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX. TWO GROUPS OF GENES PREDICTORS OF RESPONSE TO CHEMOTHERAPY WERE SELECTED, WHICH WILL HAVE TO BE VALIDATED ON NEW SAMPLES. THESE RESULTS COULD BE USED AS A BASIS TO FACILITATE RESISTANCE BYPASS THROUGH DIAGNOSTICS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NOVEL THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES.
