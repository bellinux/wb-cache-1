They have delivered detailed {{drawings of the}} linear arrays to LANL. They have processed a series of two inch wafers per submitted design. Each two inch wafer contains two 64 element arrays. After spin-coating copolymer onto the arrays, vacuum depositing the top electrodes, and polarizing the copolymer films {{so as to make}} them pyroelectrically active, each wafer was split in half. The authors developed a thicker oxide coating separating the extended gate electrode (beneath the polymer detector) from the silicon. This should reduce its parasitic capacitance and hence improve the S/N. They provided LANL three processed 64 element sensor arrays. Each array was affixed to a <b>connector</b> <b>panel</b> and selected solder pads of the common ground, the common source voltage supply connections, the 64 individual drain connections, and the 64 drain connections (for direct pyroelectric sensing response rather than the MOSFET action) were wire bonded to the <b>connector</b> <b>panel</b> solder pads.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to assess the fire {{performance}} of laminated wall panels comprised of medium density fibreboard (MDF) core sandwiched between two outer layers of a thin sheet Arborite laminates. Both fire retarded (FR) and non-fire-retarded (NFR) versions of each material were tested by themselves and also in various laminated combinations. In this research, the hypothesis is that the fire performance of each individual material will be mirrored layer by layer in the properties of the overall assembly. Important questions then included, how many of the layers need to contain fire retardant additives to achieve a target performance for the <b>panel</b> <b>assembly?</b> In addition, the effect of the glue used in the construction of the panel was unknown, but it was hypothesized that due to the flammability of most glues, the adhesives have a significant impact on the requirement for FR additives in each layer. The main apparatus used in the investigation is a Cone Calorimeter. Testing followed the ASTM E- 1345 protocol, so the time to ignition, mass loss rates, heat release rates (HRR) during open flaming periods, peak heat release rates and time to reach peak heat release rate were measured. These parameters were used to assess the relative fire performance of each base material and assembly, thus deducing the efficacy of the fire retardant additives in each combination. The <b>panel</b> <b>assembly</b> selected for the present study is typical of laminated MDF panels used as elevator cab lining materials. All materials were obtained from Elevator Cab Renovations (ECR), the industrial partner for much of this work. Both front and backer materials were made by Arborite and both regular NFR and FR versions of each were used. Similarly NFR and FR core MDF specimens were used in custom assembled test panels glued together using Permagrip PG 107, a common glue in the industry. In total seven different individual materials, eight unglued <b>panel</b> <b>assemblies</b> and eight fully assembled and glued laminated panels were tested for this research. In most cases, three repeat tests were run for each specimen to determine repeatability and, where necessary, allowing averaging to reduce overall variability in the results. Key performance indicators were determined using the results from each test and the relationships between various combinations of samples were examined. A recommendation is presented that FR additives should be used in the front and core sections of the <b>panel</b> <b>assembly.</b> This is based on the results across all tests and the observations made regarding the effectiveness of FR additives to each individual material, as well as to the <b>panel</b> <b>assembly.</b> It was also concluded that there is no strong evidence to demonstrate that the use of NFR backer materials significantly reduces the fire performance characteristics of the <b>panel</b> <b>assembly</b> when FR additives are used in the other two layers. Finally, there is strong evidence that the glue in a laminated assembly does lead to increased values of measured HRR, and also has a discernible effect on the rate of Carbon Monoxide (CO) production from the assembly...|$|R

Meanwhile, the mathematical relationship between the position errors of measurement points and the positioning errors of frames is also determined, which is then combined with the Monte Carlo simulation and the grey relational analysis to quantitatively analyze the impacts of the positioning error(s) generated by single or multiple frames on fuselage <b>panel</b> <b>assembly</b> deformation...|$|R

40|$|Dimensional {{variation}} in aircraft <b>panel</b> <b>assembly</b> {{is one of}} the most critical issues that affects the aerodynamic performance of aircraft, due to elastic deformation of parts during the positioning and clamping process. This paper proposes an assembly deformation prediction model and a variation propagation model to predict the assembly variation of aircraft panels, and derives consecutive 3 -D deformation expressions which explicitly describe the nonlinear behavior of physical interaction occurring in compliant components assembly. An assembly deformation prediction model is derived from equations of statics of elastic beam to calculate the elastic deformation of panel component resulted from positioning error and clamping force. A variation propagation model is used to describe the relationship between local variations and overall assembly variations. Assembly variations of aircraft panels due to positioning error are obtained by solving differential equations of statics and operating spatial transformations of the coordinate. The calculated results show a good prediction of {{variation in}} the experiment.

Control <b>panel</b> <b>assembly</b> structure used at {{nuclear power plants}} is important because of such reason. Seismic technology can be roughly categorized into analysis and experiment.

In order to conduct seismic analysis, it is necessary to perform modal analysis and calculate response spectrum from the FRS. The primary objective of this project includes evaluating the seismic response of the system under Operation Basis Earthquake (OBE) and Safe shutdown earthquake (SSE) and validating the results as per ASME section-III, sub-section NF for the above load cases.
