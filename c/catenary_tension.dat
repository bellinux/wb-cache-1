The purpose of this research is to better understand the collapse resistance mechanisms of reinforced concrete buildings. Currently, resisting progressive collapse is generally outside the design considerations for ordinary buildings {{due to a lack of}} information on how to economically provide that resistance. Reinforced concrete frame structures, however, may possess inherent structural redundancy and ability to withstand collapse if the structure is properly detailed to provide alternative resistance mechanisms. A more accurate progressive analysis procedure that takes into account alternative collapse resisting mechanisms will lead to the identification of detailing requirements that could be implemented economically on new buildings or retrofit measures for existing buildings to ensure a limited ability to resist collapse and save lives. Collapse resisting mechanisms studied in this research include catenary action, compressive arch action, and contributions from infill walls. This research tested a series of three quarter scale two bay by two story frames. The column between the two bays was removed to simulate a collapse scenario. The design of the three frames consisted of discontinuous reinforcement, continuous reinforcement, and infill walls placed in the bays. The discontinuous reinforcement frame reached a load of 2. 34 kips under compressive arch action and 8. 19 kips under <b>catenary</b> <b>tension.</b> The continuous reinforcement frame reached a load of 5. 81 kips under the flexural action and 8. 30 kips under <b>catenary</b> <b>tension.</b> The frame with the infill wall did not perform significantly different than the discontinuous reinforcement frame. The results show that both compressive arch and catenary action are viable resistance mechanisms in frames under a collapse loading and could reduce the required sizes and reinforcement of structural members...|$|E

Failure of a connection could cause {{collapse of the}} connected beam, {{which could lead to}} further buckling of the column as it loses its lateral support, or to progressive collapse of floor slabs. In performance-based fire design, beams are sometimes allowed both to develop very large deflections and to support the floor by developing large <b>catenary</b> <b>tension</b> forces. The tying capacity of connections to transfer these significant forces to adjacent structure when they are already subject to high rotations is essential to maintain structural stability. Traditionally, connections have been studied in terms of their moment-rotation behaviour alone. Some research has been performed on the tying capacity of connections at ambient temperature, mainly conducted in terms of a pure normal tying force. Recently however, some work has been done to investigate the behaviour of commonly used steel connections subjected to an inclined tying force at elevated temperatures. The effect of co-existent shear force and rotation on the tying capacity has been studied in furnace tests at different temperatures. This paper discusses the results of these tests on four different connection types, and their implications. A key objective is to facilitate the inclusion of the major aspects of joint behaviour into global structural analysis for performance-based structural fire engineering design of steel-framed and composite structures by means of a component approach. The test results have been used to validate models of the principal components of such connections...|$|E
40|$|Steel joints {{have always}} been {{considered}} as important parts of any structural steel building because they provide the strong links between the principal structural members. The properties and behaviour of joints in both steel and composite structures have been widely studied for some time. The focus has recently been on improving the design of structural frames {{by taking advantage of}} realistic connection moment-rotation response. This has necessitated the development of an effective and practicable methodology to describe steel connection behaviour, despite its inherent complexity. Although, the evaluation of steel connections' performance at ambient temperature has been a continuous research topic, the investigation of steel connections at elevated temperatures has only recently been tackled by researchers. However, the determination of the behaviour, available strength and stiffness of moment connections in fire conditions has been a dominant theme in these research works. Moreover, {{over a number of years}} the Component Method has been developed to describe the moment-rotation characteristics of end-plate connections, and the method is now included in Eurocode 3. To date, most of the research conducted on steel connections using the component method has focused on relatively stiff and strong connections - flush end-plates and extended end-plates. The modelling of more flexible ("pinned") connections using the Component Method has not received much attention, since the benefits arising from consideration of their behaviour in overall frame response are usually modest. However, in fire conditions connections are subject to complex force combinations of moment and tying forces, as well as vertical shear forces, and the real behaviour, even of nominally pinned connections, can have a significant effect on the overall response of the frame. To date very little information on the behaviour and the resistance of simple shear connections in fire conditions has been generated. Fin plate shear connections, which are economic to fabricate and easy to use in erection, are among these shear connections which are assumed to act as pins in normal service conditions In this research, the behaviour and robustness of simple fin plate beam-to-column connections has been investigated, under the conditions of <b>catenary</b> <b>tension</b> from highly deflected beams which occurs in fire. In addition, detailed investigations have been made on applying the component method approach to this connection at both ambient and elevated temperatures. ABAQUS software has been selected to create a very detailed 3 D finite element model. This is a complex model accounting for material nonlinearity, large deformation and contact behaviour. The connection model has been analysed through the elastic and plastic ranges up to failure. Bolt shear and bending, plate and web bearing have been observed as failure modes. A comparison between available experimental data at ambient and elevated temperatures and FEA results shows that the model has a high level of accuracy. However, by implementing the FE model the opportunity was then available to explore the connection tying resistance and the application of the Component Method to the fin plate connection. An intensive investigation has been conducted to develop a representation of this connection type via a simplified component model, enabling prediction of the connection response at both ambient and elevated temperatures. The three main components of a fin-plate connection have been identified as plate bearing, bolt shearing and web-to-plate friction. These components have been described in detail at ambient and elevated temperatures via intensive parametric FE analyses, leading to a simplified component model of a fin plate connection. This model has been evaluated against FE models of complete fin plate joints. Eventually, a fin plate connection spring model is proposed and successfully evaluated for tying, rotation, and shear actions. The Component Model presented in this research offers an opportunity to explore complicated behaviour of fin plate shear joints, and can be incorporated into frame analysis in fire conditions.

It {{can be seen that}} major cracks formed {{at the end of the}} side plates, which is 160  mm away from the column face. No major crack was observed within the region covered by the side plates, which is probably due to the confining effect of the plates with stud bolts. It was also observed that due to the <b>catenary</b> force many <b>tension</b> cracks formed along the beam length.|$|R
50|$|An {{additional}} {{issue with}} AT equipment is that, if balance weights {{are attached to}} both ends, the whole tension length will be free to move along track. To avoid this a midpoint anchor (MPA), close to {{the centre of the}} tension length, restricts movement of the messenger/catenary wire by anchoring it; the contact wire and its suspension hangers can move only within the constraints of the MPA. MPAs are sometimes fixed to low bridges, otherwise anchored to vertical catenary poles or portal <b>catenary</b> supports. A <b>tension</b> length {{can be seen as a}} fixed centre point, with the two half tension lengths expanding and contracting with temperature.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of alternative energy {{development has been}} dramatically increased by the dwindling supplies of oil and gas, and our growing efforts to protect our environment. A variety of meaningful steps have been taken in order {{to come up with}} cleaner, healthier and more affordable energy alternatives. Wind energy {{is one of the most}} reliable energy alternatives for countries that have sufficiently large wind sources. Due to the presence of steady and strong winds, and the distance from coastline residential, the offshore wind farm has become highly attractive as an ideal energy crisis solution. Floating wind turbine systems are being considered as a key solution to make the offshore wind farm feasible from an economic viewpoint, and viable as an energy resource. This paper presents the design of a synthetic mooring system for spar buoy floating wind turbines functioning in shallow water depths. Nacelle acceleration, static and dynamic <b>tensions</b> on <b>catenaries,</b> the maximum <b>tension</b> acting on the anchors are considered as design performances, and a stochastic analysis method has been used to evaluate those quantities based on sea state spectral density functions. The performance at a 100 -year hurricane condition is being defined as a limiting case, and a linear wave theory has been the most fundamental theory applied for the present analysis. by Sungho Lee.

40|$|The {{offshore}} pipeline industry are facing more complex design challenges as the oiland gas industry moves into deeper water {{in search for}} hydrocarbons. One of thesechallenges are related to high pressure/high temperature pipelines subjected tofrequent start-up and shut-downs during its? lifetime. One consequence of this kindof load cycles is that the pipeline may move cycle wise and axially towards its? coldend, which may be detrimental for the end connection design. This phenomenonis termed pipeline walking. The SAFEBUCK Joint Industry Project was initiated in 2002 to assess the challengesconnected to pipeline walking, {{in addition to other}} related issues. Throughthis project several aspects affecting the walking behaviour have been established. These factors have, in this thesis, been addressed through a sensitivity analysis,where the seabed conditions ? hereby the equivalent friction factor ? the seabedslope, the effect of a global lateral buckle and the effect of a connected SCR havebeen included. The sensitivity study was performed on a pipeline modelled in SIMLA with 900 beam elements, each connected with a spring to a seabed beam element. Thisoriginal case have here been labelled the base case. Four cases were analysed, wereone factor were changed throughout each of the cases. The pipeline was subjectedto a transient temperature profile in each case, provided by IKM Ocean Design,to simulate the heat transfer in a pipeline. For the seabed conditions case, the walk per load cycle increased with increasingequivalent friction factor up to a certain point, before the walk per load cycledecreased as the equivalent friction factor continued to increase. The seabed slopecase showed that the relationship between walk per cycle and increasing angle isapproximately linear. In addition it was established that when the seabed slope issteep enough, the pipeline will walk towards its? warm end. In the global lateralbuckle case on could observe that the effective axial friction force was relievedin the buckle, and that the walk per cycle increased as the length of the buckleincreased. When a steel <b>catenary</b> riser <b>tension</b> was introduced, the axial movementof the pipeline appeared to fluctuate around the walk per cycle values for the basecase. An analytical analysis was performed, however, the accordance between the numericaland analytical results was not as good as predicted. For this reason animprovement of the analytical model is suggested for further work. An other topicwhich is relevant for further work is an extension of the seabed conditions case toinclude mobilisation length. Additional sub-cases in the steel catenary riser case, aswell as creating a new case by combining the impact from several walking inducingfactors are other possible topics. </p...|$|R
