5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is {{a simple way to}} control the concentration and ionic strength. The concentration of solutes affects many <b>colligative</b> <b>properties,</b> including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased ionic strength reduces the thickness of the electrical double layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E

[...] Since the discovery of evidence for extraterrestrial liquid water, substantial quantities of it are now thought to occur outside the circumstellar habitable zone. The concept of deep biospheres, like Earth's, that exist independently of stellar energy, are now generally accepted in astrobiology given {{the large amount of}} liquid water known to exist within in lithospheres and asthenospheres of the Solar System. Sustained by other energy sources, such as tidal heating or radioactive decay or pressurized by non-atmospheric means, liquid water may be found even on rogue planets, or their moons. Liquid water can also exist at a wider range of temperatures and pressures as a solution, for example with sodium chlorides in seawater on Earth, chlorides and sulphates on equatorial Mars, or ammoniates, due to its different <b>colligative</b> <b>properties.</b> In addition, other circumstellar zones, where non-water solvents favorable to hypothetical life based on alternative biochemistries could exist in liquid form at the surface, have been proposed.|$|E

40|$|The {{generally}} accepted view of osmotic pressure {{is that it}} is a <b>colligative</b> <b>property,</b> along with freezing point depression, boiling point elevation and vapour pressure lowering. These properties ideally depend on the concentration of dissolved solute molecules. Osmotic pressure, however, is also generated, without any solute, at hydrophilic surfaces. Here is presented a rationale and explanation for this phenomenon...|$|R

5000|$|Through cryoscopy, a known {{constant}} {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} an unknown molar mass. The term [...] "cryoscopy" [...] comes from Greek and means [...] "freezing measurement." [...] Freezing point depression is a <b>colligative</b> <b>property,</b> so [...] depends only on the number of solute particles dissolved, not the nature of those particles. Cryoscopy is related to ebullioscopy, which determines the same value from the ebullioscopic constant (of boiling point elevation).|$|R
50|$|Consider {{the problem}} in which the solvent freezes to a very nearly pure crystal, {{regardless}} {{of the presence of}} the nonvolatile solute. This typically occurs simply because the solute molecules do not fit well in the crystal, i.e. substituting a solute for a solvent molecule in the crystal has high enthalpy. In this case, for low solute concentrations, the freezing point depression depends solely on the concentration of solute particles, not on their individual properties. The freezing point depression thus is called a <b>colligative</b> <b>property.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In chemistry, <b>colligative</b> <b>{{properties}}</b> are {{properties of}} solutions {{that depend on}} {{the ratio of the}} number of solute particles to the number of solvent molecules in a solution, and not {{on the nature of the}} chemical species present. The number ratio can be related to the various units for concentration of solutions. The assumption that solution properties are independent of the nature of solute particles is only exact for ideal solutions, and is approximate for dilute real solutions. In other words, <b>colligative</b> <b>properties</b> are a set of solution properties that can be reasonably approximated by assuming that the solution is ideal.|$|E

Osmotic pressure is a <b>colligative</b> <b>property,</b> meaning that the property depends on the concentration of the solute, but not on its identity. It also is involved in facilitated diffusion.|$|R

40|$|Osmolarity is a <b>colligative</b> <b>property</b> of {{solutions}} {{that depends on}} the number ofdissolved particles. The three types of solutes most encountered in biological fluidsare electrolytes, organic non-electrolyte molecules and colloids. The osmolarity ofthe extracellular fluid is about equal to that of the intracellular fluid, although thereare significant differences in the ionic composition of the two compartments. Plasmaosmolarity is a convenient and accurate guide to intracellular osmolarity. There areseveral different formulas for the calculation of human serum osmolarity. The goalof this study is to estimate the plasma osmolarity in chickens from theconcentrations of the main electrolytes and the glucose and urea content, and toestablish the contribution of each osmotic component. Linear regression analysiswas carried out to determine the best predictors of serum osmolarity in chickens. Two equations were also deduced for calculating serum osmolarity using manualregression analysis...|$|R

5000|$|Reverse osmosis (RO) is a water {{purification}} technology {{that uses a}} semipermeable membrane to remove ions, molecules, and larger particles from drinking water. In reverse osmosis, an applied pressure is used to overcome osmotic pressure, a <b>colligative</b> <b>property,</b> that is driven by chemical potential differences of the solvent, a thermodynamic parameter. Reverse osmosis can remove many types of dissolved and suspended species from water, including bacteria, and is used in both industrial processes {{and the production of}} potable water. The result is that the solute is retained on the pressurized side of the membrane and the pure solvent is allowed to pass to the other side. To be [...] "selective", this membrane should not allow large molecules or ions through the pores (holes), but should allow smaller components of the solution (such as solvent molecules) to pass freely.|$|R
50|$|The {{boiling point}} {{elevation}} is a <b>colligative</b> <b>property,</b> {{which means that}} it {{is dependent on the}} presence of dissolved particles and their number, but not their identity. It is an effect of the dilution of the solvent {{in the presence of a}} solute. It is a phenomenon that happens for all solutes in all solutions, even in ideal solutions, and does not depend on any specific solute-solvent interactions. The boiling point elevation happens both when the solute is an electrolyte, such as various salts, and a nonelectrolyte. In thermodynamic terms, the origin of the boiling point elevation is entropic and can be explained in terms of the vapor pressure or chemical potential of the solvent. In both cases, the explanation depends on the fact that many solutes are only present in the liquid phase and do not enter into the gas phase (except at extremely high temperatures).|$|R
5000|$|Jacobus van 't Hoff first {{proposed}} a [...] "law" [...] relating osmotic pressure to solute concentrationwhere [...] is osmotic pressure, csolutes is the molar concentration, {{equal to the}} number of moles of solute in the solution divided by the solution volume, the total molar concentration of all solutes that cannot pass through a water-permeable membrane. T is the temperature in kelvins. This formula states that osmotic pressure is simply proportional to the solute concentration. It applies when the solute concentration is sufficiently low that the solution can be treated as an ideal solution. The proportionality to concentration means that osmotic pressure is a <b>colligative</b> <b>property.</b> Note the similarity of this formula to the ideal gas law in the form [...] where n is the total number of moles of gas molecules in the volume V, and n/V is the molar concentration of gas molecules.|$|R
50|$|An {{antifreeze}} is an additive which {{lowers the}} freezing {{point of a}} water-based liquid. An antifreeze mixture is used to achieve freezing-point depression for cold environments and also achieves boiling-point elevation ("anti-boil") to allow higher coolant temperature.

50|$|Measurement of <b>colligative</b> <b>properties</b> for a dilute {{solution}} of a non-ionized solute such as urea or glucose in water or another solvent {{can lead to}} determinations of relative molar masses, both for small molecules and for polymers which cannot be studied by other means.

50|$|While molar masses {{are almost}} always, in practice, {{calculated}} from atomic weights, {{they can also}} be measured in certain cases. Such measurements are much less precise than modern mass spectrometric measurements of atomic weights and molecular masses, and are of mostly historical interest.

40|$|Since its {{discovery}} as {{a crucial}} cocatalyst in metallocene and post-metallocene olefin polymerizations methylaluminoxane (MAO) has retained commercial and academic status. In spite of continued interest the MAO structure remains ambiguously defined. Because of limited alkane solubility toluene emerged as the MAO solvent of necessity. With time these toluene solutions can develop a gel fraction. The MAO structures proposed include linear, ring, ladder, and cyclic with the latter involving fused four and six membered rings along with cage and drumlike architectures. The linear and ring structures have aluminum and oxygen valences of three and two respectively while the other structures require Al/O co-ordination numbers of four and three. MAO structural information has been gathered from <b>colligative</b> <b>property</b> measurements, various NMR formats and quantum chemical calculations. We have used small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) fortified with static and dynamic light scattering (SLS/DLS) as the primary analysis tool for dilute MAO solutions (phi/phi* <= 0. 6). The main structure assayed is a linear polymer chain consisting of [-Al(CH 3) -O-] monomer units with an M-w of 20 kg/mol and a negative second virial coefficient. The latter fortifies the recognized state of play that toluene is a poor MAO solvent. About 0. 8 wt % of MAO was captured as large-scale three-dimensional aggregates. Elemental analysis results show that in these large-scale aggregates the ratio of O/Al is significantly larger than for the smaller polymer chains. Additionally the large-scale aggregates contain {{only a small fraction}} of CH 3 units. Those structures may be the precursor aggregates to the previously observed macroscopic gel fraction reported to form over time at room temperature. The solutions studied in this work did not show gel formation over an 8 -month period at similar to 0 degrees C...|$|R
40|$|The {{cleavage}} {{specificity of}} the Pvu II and BamHI restriction endonucleases {{is found to}} be dramatically reduced at elevated osmotic pressure. Relaxation in specificity of these otherwise highly accurate and specific enzymes, previously termed "star activity," is uniquely correlated with osmotic pressure between 0 and 100 atmospheres. No other <b>colligative</b> solvent <b>property</b> exhibits a uniform correlation with star activity for all of the compounds tested. Application of hydrostatic pressure counteracts the effects of osmotic pressure and restores the natural selectivity of the enzymes for their canonical recognition sequences. These results indicate that water solvation {{plays an important role in}} the site-specific recognition of DNA by many restriction enzymes. Osmotic pressure did not induce an analogous effect on the specificity of the EcoRV endonuclease, implying that selective hydration effects do not participate in DNA recognition in this system. Hydrostatic pressure was found to have little effect on the star activity induced by changes in ionic strength, pH, or divalent cation, suggesting that distinct mechanisms may exist for these observed alterations in specificity. Recent evidence has indicated that BamHI and EcoRI share similar structural motifs, while Pvu II and EcoRV belong to a different structural family. Evidently, the use of hydration water to assist in site-specific recognition is a motif neither limited to nor defined by structural families...|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{investigate}} whether analytical methods {{based on the}} <b>colligative</b> physical chemical <b>properties</b> of ions or solutes in sweat are less effective than the specific measurement of electrolytes in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF).  METHODS—A single sweat sample was collected (Macroduct) from each of 211 infants and children, of whom 57 had CF, for the measurment of sodium, chloride, osmolality, and conductivity.  RESULTS—The ranges within which CF and non-CF individual values overlapped (equivocal ranges), were wider for sodium and osmolality measurement than for chloride or conductivity. Neither of the latter two measurements provided a discriminatory advantage over the other. The utilisation of broadly based age related ranges for non-CF control subjects served to improve the discriminatory power of all four measurements to an extent that, in this cohort, both chloride and conductivity provided complete discrimination.  CONCLUSION—Sweat conductivity is as effective as chloride measurement in the laboratory diagnosis of CF. ...|$|R
