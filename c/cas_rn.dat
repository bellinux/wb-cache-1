40|$|THE {{effect of}} carnitine, {{a drug that}} plays an {{essential}} role in mitochondria metabolism, on {{some of the most important}} human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) activation steps including modulation of adhesion molecule density, reactive oxygen species production, and tumour necrosis factor- 0 t (TNF 0 t) production was investigated. The capability of carnitine in protecting PMN from deter ioration on storage was also studied. Data shows that carnitine exerts considerable effects on all PMN functions investigated. Although the ultimate effect was often donor dependent, TNF 0 t production was exceptional in that carnitine was able to consistently reduce TNF 0 t production in Staphylococcus aureus stimulated PMN in a clear dose-dependent fashion. It is concluded that carnitine may represent a useful active agent in situations characterized by PMN mobilization/activation.

30|$|An {{additional}} {{issue of}} the out-band relaying is that with fixed carrier sizes (as today assumed in LTE) it does not allow flexible resource partitioning between the backhaul and access links in the frequency domain. In the LTE system, there are only few carrier sizes specified (1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 MHz). A {{solution to this problem}} is the carrier aggregation (CA) technique included in the LTE-Advanced system [44 – 46]. With CA multiple carriers can be used simultaneously for communication on each link, i.e., it can be applied to backhaul, access, and direct links. By enabling the <b>CA</b> technique for <b>RNs</b> proportions of resources assigned to the backhaul and access links can be controlled with higher flexibility.|$|R
30|$|Considering the {{deployment}} of 10 RNs and 25 UEs per DeNB cell area, {{we have seen in}} Section 3.1. 2 that an RN should be assigned with 19 - 34 % of system resources for its access link operation. In case of a system with 100 MHz total bandwidth (maximum allowed in LTE-Advanced Release- 10) and <b>CA</b> enabled, the <b>RN</b> could be assigned with 20 MHz primary access link carrier and 15 MHz secondary access link carrier. Such configuration would enable dynamic scaling of the RN's access link resources in range of 20 - 35 %. Alternatively, the RN could be configured with 2 × 20 MHz carriers for simplicity. At the same time, the remaining 60 MHz of the system bandwidth could be used for allocation of the backhaul link. As estimated in Section 3.1. 1, a single RN should utilize up to 17 % of system resources for its backhaul link. Considering this, the backhaul link could be allocated on a single 20 MHz carrier (up to 20 % of system resources) or distributed on multiple carriers. The later approach can provide higher flexibility for resource sharing at the DeNB (i.e., between backhaul and direct links and between backhaul links of different RNs). This aspect is discussed in more details in Section 4.1.|$|R

40|$|Objetivo: Evaluar la interrelación de índices de resistencia y sensibilidad a la {{insulina}} con variables antropométricas y metabólicas de mujeres del tercer trimestre de embarazo y RN a término. Métodos: Este estudio transversal evaluó 52 mujeres sanas en el tercer trimestre del embarazo y 52 reciénnacidos (RN) a término. Se evaluaron peso corporal pregestacional y ganancia durante el embarazo (?peso). Se estimó el peso fetal (PFE), circunferencia abdominal fetal (CAF) y grosor placentario por ultrasonido. Se registró peso, talla y circunferencia abdominal (<b>CA)</b> del <b>RN</b> y peso placentario. Se realizó lipidograma, glucosa e insulina en ayunas en el suero de la madre y cordón umbilical. Se calcularon los índices lipídicos y de resistencia y sensibilidad a la insulina. Resultados: El ?peso materno se correlacionó positivamente con PFE y peso del RN (r= 0, 32, p< 0, 02; r= 0, 32, p< 0, 05). El HOMA-R del RN se relacionó positivamente con CT (r= 0, 46; p< 0, 01) y TG (r= 0, 52; p< 0, 0001). El índice TG/C-HDL del RN se correlacionó positivamente con índices HOMA-R y TG/C-HDLmat (r= 0, 31, p= 0, 03; r= 0, 35, p= 0, 01). El peso pregestacional, materno final, placentario y TG maternos fueron significativamente más altos en los RN de mayor peso. Los índices TG/C-HDLmat y HOMA-Rmat se relacionaron inversamente con los índices QUICKImat y HOMA-Smat (p< 0, 01). Conclusiones: La cuantificación de los índices TG/C-HDL, HOMA-R, HOMA-S y QUICKI en el tercer trimestre del embarazo, puede tener utilidad potencial para identificar mujeres con riesgo alto para desarrollar complicaciones metabólicas en el embarazo. 146 - 155 lenys@ula. veelsy. velazquez@gmail. com. CuatrimestralObjective: To {{evaluate the}} relationship between insulin resistance and sensibility indexes with anthropometrics and metabolic parameters in third trimester of pregnant women and normal term newborns. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 52 normal pregnant women in third trimester and 52 term born were assessed. Pre-gestational body weight, blood pressure and pregnancy weight gain (?-weight) were registered. Estimated fetal weight (EFW) and abdominal circumference (AFC) and placental gross were evaluated by ultrasound. Placental and newborn body weight, height and abdominal circumference were registered. Serum lipids, glucose and insulin concentrations were measured in fasting women and cord blood. Placental weight was registered. Lipids and insulin resistance and sensibility indexes were calculated. Results: ?-weight was significant and positively correlated with EFW and newborn body weight (r= 0, 32, p< 0, 02; r= 0, 32; p< 0, 05). Newborn HOMA-R {{was positively correlated with}} total cholesterol (TC) (r= 0, 46; p< 0, 01) and triglycerides serum concentration (r= 0, 52; p< 0, 0001). TG/C-HDL index was positively correlated with HOMA-R and maternal TG/C-HDL(r= 0, 31, p= 0, 03; r= 0, 35, p= 0, 01). Pre-gestational weight, term weight, placental and serum maternal triglycerides were significantly higher in newborns with higher body weight group. Maternal TG/C-HDL and HOMA-R were negatively related with maternal QUICKI and HOMA-S (p< 0, 01). Conclusions: The quantification of TG/C-HDL, HOMA-R, HOMA-S QUICKI indexes in pregnant women during third trimester could be potentially useful to identify pregnant women at high risk of developing metabolic complications during pregnancy...|$|R

The need for Registered Nurses (RNs) in the long-term care of older people is being questioned, particularly {{in the context of}} nursing shortages, while suggestions for 'professionalising' Care Assistant (CA) roles are emerging. Despite ongoing debates about the importance of their work, research has so far been unable to provide an evidence-base for the outcomes of the work of either <b>RNs</b> or <b>CAs</b> in UK care homes. Using a multi-method interpretive approach, adopting a structure-process-outcome framework and grounded in the philosophical hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer, this qualitative research sought to illuminate the distinct contributions made by <b>RNs</b> and <b>CAs</b> to outcomes for older people in care homes. <b>RNs</b> and <b>CAs</b> from around the UK contributed 'significant' examples of their work for Phase 1 of the study and Phase 2 comprised researcher fieldwork (observation, interviews and documentary analysis) in three care homes around England. Participants included <b>RNs,</b> <b>CAs,</b> older residents, relatives, home managers and professionals working in the homes. The findings offer a rich and detailed analysis of the realities of the work, much of which takes place 'behind closed doors' and has been described to a limited extent in the literature. They suggest that the CAs' daily support helps residents to function and to feel valued, and that close, reciprocal, family-type relationships develop. The health knowledge and clinical expertise of good RNs is critical in determining residents' health outcomes, particularly in the long-term, and RNs' 24 -hour 'perceptual presence' can make life or death differences in acute or emergency situations.

In the context of the literature, the findings offer new insights into the role and contribution of <b>RNs</b> and <b>CAs,</b> the outcomes of their work and the priorities of residents.
