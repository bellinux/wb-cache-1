25|$|As {{a result}} of the EEF advance to Rafa and their {{lengthening}} of their lines of communication along the <b>coast,</b> <b>flank</b> attacks became a threat. This was because the Ottoman lines of communication further inland overlapped the EEF advance on the coast, and it became important to garrison the region strongly. The EEF right flank would not be in prepared defences, and was potentially vulnerable to an envelopment assault.|$|E
2500|$|The {{southeast}} <b>coast</b> is <b>flanked</b> at {{a distance}} of [...] from the sea by a parallel range of mountains, the Crimean Mountains. These mountains are backed by secondary parallel ranges.|$|R
5000|$|In the African Great Lakes region, Omani and Yemeni traders set up slave-trading posts {{along the}} southeastern {{coast of the}} Indian Ocean; most notably in the {{archipelago}} of Zanzibar, {{along the coast of}} present-day Tanzania. The Zanj region or Swahili <b>Coast</b> <b>flanking</b> the Indian Ocean continued to be an important area for the Oriental slave trade up until the 19th century. Livingstone and Stanley were then the first Europeans to penetrate to the interior of the Congo Basin and to discover the scale of slavery there. The Arab Tippu Tip extended his influence there and captured many people as slaves. After Europeans had settled in the Gulf of Guinea, the trans-Saharan slave trade became less important. In Zanzibar, slavery was abolished late, in 1897, under Sultan Hamoud bin Mohammed.|$|R
5000|$|According to Australian maps, South Australia's south <b>coast</b> is <b>flanked</b> by the Southern Ocean, but {{official}} international consensus {{defines the}} Southern Ocean as extending north from the pole only to 60°S or 55°S, at least 17 degrees of latitude further south {{than the most}} southern point of South Australia. Thus the south coast is officially adjacent to the south-most portion of the Indian Ocean. See Southern Ocean: Existence and definitions ...|$|R
50|$|Satakunta is {{characterized}} by a strong contrast of coast and inland areas. The southernmost part of the <b>coast</b> is <b>flanked</b> by the archipelago of Rauma but towards north, the number of coastal islands decreases markedly. The seabed is flat and due to this, the still-continuing post-glacial rising is perceivable even during a single person's lifetime. The dominating feature of the northern coast of Satakunta is the delta of Kokemäenjoki northeast of the town of Pori.|$|R
50|$|The {{geography}} of South Australia incorporates the south {{central part of}} the continent of Australia. It is one of the six states of Australia. South Australia is bordered on the west by Western Australia, to the north by the Northern Territory, Queensland to the northeast, and both New South Wales and Victoria to the east. South Australia's south <b>coast</b> is <b>flanked</b> by the Great Australian Bight and the Indian Ocean, although it is referred to locally as the Southern Ocean.|$|R
5000|$|John Little State Natural Reserve is a {{state park}} unit of California, United States, {{protecting}} a section of steep, rugged cliffs on the Big Sur <b>coast.</b> The reserve <b>flanks</b> the mouth of Lime Creek and contains the 1917 cabin of Elizabeth K. Livermore, an early conservationist. It is located in Monterey County between California State Route 1 and the Pacific Ocean. [...] The 21 acre park was established in 1953.|$|R
5000|$|Kinnikannanvilai is {{a village}} {{along the west}} <b>coast</b> of Kanyakumari <b>flanked</b> by Muhilankudieruppu {{in the south and}} Koilvilai in the north. Kinnikannanvilai is bound by Pozhiyoor in the east and Arabian Sea in the west. The village is {{connected}} with Kanyakumari Bus Terminus (4 km) and Nagercoil town (16 km) by road. The nearest city is Thiruvananthapuram (Capital of Kerala). The holy capitals, Swamithope and Suchindrum are [...] and [...] away from Kinnikannanvilai respectively.|$|R
5|$|At about 04:30 on May 18, the Syrian 1st Brigade, now {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Husni al-Za'im and consisting of about 30 vehicles, including tanks, advanced west towards Samakh (Tzemah) in two columns—one across the <b>coast,</b> and another <b>flanking</b> from the south. A contingent was allocated further south, {{in order to}} secure the safety of the main force by flanking Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada from the west. It entered a stalemate with a new Israeli position northwest of the two villages.|$|R
5000|$|The Chinookan peoples {{were once}} one of the most {{powerful}} and populous groups of tribes on the southern part of the Northwest <b>Coast.</b> Their territories <b>flank</b> the mouth of the Columbia River and stretch up that river in a narrow band adjacent to that river, as far as Celilo Falls. Their group of dialects are known as Chinookan. It is distinguished from the Chinook Jargon, which was partly based upon it, and is often called [...] "Chinook." [...] Close allies of the Nuu-chah-nulth peoples, they are also a canoe people, and pre-European contact, Chinook Jargon arose as a trading language incorporating both Chinookan and Wakashan vocabulary. The Chinookan peoples practiced slavery, likely learned from the Nuu-chah-nulth as it was more common to the north, and cranial deformation. Those without flattened heads were considered to be beneath or servile to those who had undergone the procedure as infants.|$|R
2500|$|On 21/22 July 1942, Major General Tomitaro Horii's Japanese South Seas Detachment {{landed at}} Buna–Gona on the {{northern}} coast of Papua [...] and subsequently began an advance overland south towards Port Moresby on the southern <b>coast,</b> with a <b>flanking</b> move via the sea towards Milne Bay planned for late August and early September. In order to counter the Japanese designs on the area, the Allied planners developed a hasty operation dubbed [...] "Maroubra", and under the operational command of Major General Basil Morris' New Guinea Force, an ad hoc force called Maroubra Force was established. Initially, only a small force from the Papuan Infantry Battalion (PIB) and the Militia 39th Infantry Battalion stood in their way, fighting a delaying action on 23 July around Awala before falling back {{to the village of}} Kokoda. On the night of 28/29 July, the Australians and Japanese clashed again, with the Japanese seizing control of the village in a see-saw encounter. A counter-attack was made on 8 August, which resulted in heavy losses for both the Japanese and the Australians, but the Japanese retained control of Kokoda and the PIB and the 39th Infantry Battalion, short of ammunition and rations, withdrew further south along the Kokoda Track towards Deniki.|$|R
