With this, a nearly 6-year heroic {{struggle}} has ended. It brought us great victories but also heavy defeats. The Wehrmacht has been honorably defeated by superior forces. The German soldier, in accordance with his oath, has given his unforgettable effort to his people. Till the end the homeland supported him with all its strength, under the heaviest sacrifices. The singular performance of the front and Fatherland shall receive its final honor in the later, fair judgement.

25|$|In some cases, cognate terms {{used for}} {{parallel}} {{practices in the}} early medieval Irish and Welsh laws allow us to assume that these practices were already used in what is referred to by linguists as the 'common Celtic period', which is usually dated to around 1000 BC (e.g. Kelly 1988, 231), although this at best is a very rough estimate. Where parallels for such practices exist, but with non-cognate terminology, in other Indo-European laws, we <b>can</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> consider the cognate practices as specifically Celtic forms of law. Similarly, where such cognate terminology exists for parallel practices in the early medieval Celtic laws, but not in other Indo-European laws, we can consider these to be specifically Celtic laws.|$|E

In 2005 the Romanian Bahá'í community numbered some 7,000, but in January 2007 a law was passed that imposed restrictive requirements on religious communities that wished to be recognized by the government, which Bahá'ís and adherents of other minority religions could not meet.

25|$|Shallow {{landslides}} {{can often}} happen {{in areas that}} have slopes with high permeable soils on top of low permeable bottom soils. The low permeable, bottom soils trap {{the water in the}} shallower, high permeable soils creating high water pressure in the top soils. As the top soils are filled with water and become heavy, slopes can become very unstable and slide over the low permeable bottom soils. Say there is a slope with silt and sand as its top soil and bedrock as its bottom soil. During an intense rainstorm, the bedrock will keep the rain trapped in the top soils of silt and sand. As the topsoil becomes saturated and heavy, it <b>can</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> slide over the bedrock and become a shallow landslide.|$|E
500|$|Incident signals {{containing}} TM modes above {{a certain}} frequency can generate modes which propagate along the longitudinal slots with the slots themselves acting as waveguides.

[...] If this frequency is above the required stopband of the filter the effect is of no consequence. [...] Otherwise, steps outside the filter are needed to suppress these modes and can be incorporated into the end-matching sections.|$|E

[...] In 1982 a cluster of seventeen steam devils was observed when the air temperature was between 17 and 21°C. [...] Although this is much higher than, for instance, the temperature of the air over the Great Lakes, the water temperature is also proportionately higher, being very close to boiling, so the temperature difference is still 79°C.|$|E

500|$|For a {{star with}} at least 0.5 , when the {{hydrogen}} supply in its core is exhausted and it expands to become a red giant, it <b>can</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> fuse helium atoms to form carbon. The energy output of the helium fusion process per unit mass is only about a tenth the energy output of the hydrogen process, and the luminosity of the star increases. This results in a much shorter length of time in this stage compared to the main sequence lifetime. (For example, the Sun is predicted to spend [...] burning helium, compared to about 12 billion years burning hydrogen.) Thus, about 90% of the observed stars above 0.5 [...] {{will be on the}} main sequence. On average, main-sequence stars are known to follow an empirical mass-luminosity relationship.

Following the release of their second album, the Scissor Girls were offered a contract by Atavistic with the stipulation that the band would release two further records for the label. Guitarist Kelly Kuvo declined the offer, but both Youssefi and Melowic agreed to be signed to Atavistic.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{response}} to some early negative reactions to the actress' performance, Jon Lachonis noted {{in a review of}} the first season's seventh episode that [...] "Anna Torv, whose chill portrayal of FBI agent and Pattern investigator Olivia Dunham has come under fire for being too wooden, seems to have reinvented her character to answer the critics. The good news is, Anna's new and more animated Olivia isn't really a departure so much as it is a character who seems to have had a catharsis. She is comfortable in her skin now, and the stillness is pulled back in favor of more humanity. Of course, it is helpful that she reunites with an old beau in this episode - if there is one thing Fringe is totally lacking it is sexual tension." [...] Executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman defended Torv's early Fringe work in a 2011 interview, explaining the character was designed to be [...] "bland, because of her conditioning as a child and everything she's been through. Now, one can argue that maybe that wasn't the best way for us to introduce the main character, but there was a purpose. So Anna had to listen to all these people saying 'She's really doing nothing,' when really it was our issue. We didn't write anything for her because... well, now you know why. But at the time, people were like, 'Wow, this girl really is not much,' which is so not true. Anna was just so professional, and so great. She did it with excellence, and now she's really getting the chance to show people, 'Hey, I'm a really hard worker and a terrific actor.' We're so thankful that people <b>can</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> see her for who she really is. Midway through the second season, Sarah Stegall from SFScope believed Torv [...] "had the most progress and the most satisfying development" [...] of all the main actors, stating she [...] "is now carrying this role with grace and strength". Stegall partly attributed the growth of the actor and character to her recovery early in the second season, the introduction of a sister and niece, the removal of John Scott from her storyline, and the [...] "delicate, reserved flirtation" [...] with Peter.|$|E
