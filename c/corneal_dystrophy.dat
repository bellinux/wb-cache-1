40|$|<b>Corneal</b> <b>dystrophies</b> are a {{heterogeneous}} group of bilateral, inherited, rare diseases characterized by slowly progressive corneal opacities, {{that lead to}} visual impairment. Most of them have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with variable expressivity, but new mutations have been described. Many <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies</b> have been genetically characterized and the specific gene mutations identified, such as for the epithelial-stromal TGFBI dystrophies. Current classification systems identified four main groups of <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies</b> based on clinical, histologic and genetic information. Diagnosis is performed during a routine ophthalmic examination that shows typical cellular abnormalities of the corneal epithelium, stroma or endothelium. Disease progression should be carefully monitored to decide the proper clinical management. The treatment of <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies</b> is variable, depending on symptoms, clinical course, severity and type of dystrophy. Management aimed to reduce symptoms and to improve vision, includes different surgical approaches. Novel cellular and genetic therapeutic approaches are under evaluation.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the phenotype in a large family with autosomal-dominant recurrent corneal erosions, and also to exclude genetic linkage to known autosomal-dominant inherited <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies</b> with clinical resemblance. Methods: We describe the medical history and clinical findings in patients from a six-generation family with recurrent corneal erosions. A total of 28 individuals were evaluated by ophthalmological examination. Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood and analysed with polymorphic microsatellite markers close to known genes causing autosomal-dominant <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies.</b> Results: The patients had erosive symptoms that usually lasted from 1 to 7 days. The symptoms were described as early as at 8 months of age, and by the age of 5 the majority of the affected individuals suffered from recurrent corneal erosions. The attacks generally declined in frequency and intensity with age, and 52 % of the patients developed central keloid-like corneal opacities. Nine patients received corneal grafts, and recurrences were seen in all grafts. The affected patients did not share haplotypes for genetic microsatellite markers surrounding known genes causing autosomal-dominant <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies.</b> Conclusion: We describe a new hereditary disease with recurrent corneal erosions. Attacks of symptoms similar to recurrent erosions dominate the phenotype, but half of those affected also developed corneal, keloid-like, central opacities.

25|$|Cancer, {{the most}} common being hemangiosarcoma, {{followed}} by lymphosarcoma, mast cell tumour, and osteosarcoma, {{was the cause of}} death for 61.4% of American Goldens according to a 1998 health study conducted by the Golden Retriever Club of America, making it the breed's biggest killer. A 2004 survey by the UK Kennel Club puts this number at 38.8%. Although most puppies are screened for the disorders before being sold (by reputable breeders), hip and elbow dysplasia afflict one-fifth of dogs.

40|$|Purpose: To analyze genotype-phenotype {{correlation}} {{in patients}} originating from Polish population with the transforming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI) <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies.</b> Methods: Sixty affected and 31 unaffected individuals from 15 unrelated Polish families {{were included in}} the study. The clinical diagnosis was based on the slit-lamp exam, 1310 nm time domain and 1310 nm swept source spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Histopathologic analysis was performed on 10 available corneal buttons. Exons of the TGFBI gene were screened for mutations with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct DNA sequencing. Results: We found the lattice phenotype dominant compared to the granular one in the Polish population (41 : 16 patients; lattice:granular). We identified five distinct mutations responsible for TGFBI <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies</b> (R 124 R, R 124 H, R 555 W, R 555 Q, and H 626 R). There was a strong genotype-phenotype correlation in the case of R 124 R and R 555 W mutations, while there was a distinct phenotypic heterogeneity {{in the case of the}} H 626 R mutation. OCT analysis revealed that the reflectivity, location and pattern of the corneal deposits were different among the TGFBI <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies.</b> The advantage of spectral swept source OCT over time-domain OCT scans is a more distinct visualization of the Bowman’s layer area and deposits located under the epithelium.

40|$|<b>Corneal</b> <b>dystrophies</b> {{refer to}} a group of corneal {{diseases}} and that are genetically determined. These have been traditionally classified with respect to the layer of cornea involved. We now know that this does not reflect the underlying pathobiology. Most of the <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies</b> are of Mendelian inheritance with some phenotype diversity and a variable degree of penetrance. The dystrophies involving enzymatic processes tend to be of autosomal recessive inheritance. In some cases, such as keratoconus, the inheritance pattern is not always clear and is considered complex. The age of onset of the disease, as in most inherited eye disorders, is variable and does not reflect the underlying pathogenic defect. Few cases are congenital. Our understanding of <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies</b> is undergoing somewhat of a revolution as over 12 chromosomes have been associated with <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies</b> with mutations identified in at least 14 genes if one includes anterior segment dysgenesis in this group of conditions. Several dystrophies remain without a gene or a genetic location (locus) and more familial studies are required. The new molecular information is challenging the traditional thinking about these conditions that was usually guided by the histopathological findings. As this new knowledge becomes more refined, the classification of this group of disorders will eventually be revisited to have a molecular basis. The elucidation of the underlying biochemical pathways may allow us to envisage the possibility of modulating these phenotypes in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{transforming}} {{growth factor}} beta-induced (TGFBI) gene, which was first identified from a cDNA library screening effort in TGFβ- 1 -treated A 549 cells, encodes a secretory extracellular matrix protein (TGFBIp) containing 683 amino acids [1]. The primary sequence analysis reveals that TGFBIp contains an N-terminal signal peptide, a cysteine-rich domain (EMI domain in EMILIN), four fasci-clin- 1 like (FAS- 1) domains, and a C-terminal RGD motif. TGFBIp {{has been shown}} to be expressed widely by various tissues and cell lines [1 - 3], and is implicated in cellular func-tions such as cell attachment, migration, and differentiation [2, 3], as well as in pathological events such as tumorigenesis [4 - 6] or amyloidosis in the cornea [7]. More than 30 missense mutations of TGFBIp in human chromosome 5 q 31 have been linked to a group of stromal <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies</b> characterized by prominent abnormal deposits in the cornea, as either amyloid fibrils and/or amorphous aggregations, and are occasionally associated with chronic epithelial erosion and inflammation [7, 8]. The dystrophic mutations primarily cluster around the first and fourth FAS- 1 domains. Surgical procedures such as corneal transplant or phototherapeutic keratoplasty have been applied to treat these <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies,</b> but are ineffective in preventing the recurrence of the devastating phenotypes. Without proper interventions or treatments, TGFBI-related <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies</b> can lead to vision loss. Although extensive molecular analyses in patient popula-tions have established the genetic etiology of TGFBI-related <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies,</b> the molecular basis of the pathogenic mechanism remains unclear.

25|$|The National Eye Institute reports {{keratoconus}} is {{the most}} common <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophy</b> in the United States, affecting about one in 2,000 Americans, but some reports place the figure as high as one in 500.

A long-term study found a mean incidence rate of 2.0 new cases per 100,000 population per year.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} high-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in determining the depth of corneal pathology in eyes undergoing excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) for primary or recurrent anterior stro-mal <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies.</b> <b>Corneal</b> clarity, visual acuity and refractive changes in eyes with and without an antihyperopia treatment were also analyzed. Methods: Twenty eyes of 14 patients with anterior stromal <b>corneal</b> <b>dystrophies</b> were treated with PTK. Eyes were eval-uated preoperatively and 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively with slit-lamp biomicroscopy, manifest refraction, keratometry, computerized corneal topography, ultrasound pachymetry, and UBM. Results: Nineteen of 20 corneas (95 %) had greatly improved corneal clarity after PTK. Mean uncorrected Snellen vision improved from 20 / 102 to 20 / 69 and best corrected vision improved from 20 / 62 to 20 / 38. Nine eyes (45 %) improved 2 or more lines of uncorrected vision, and 13 eyes (65 %) improved 2 or more lines of best corrected vision. Mean change in spherical equivalent was just – 0. 92 diopters (D); however, the range was large (– 13 to + 3. 88 D). UBM measurement of central corneal pathology did not correlate with the actual PTK ablation depth (P =. 07). The amount of antihyper-opia treatment did not correlate with changes in manifest refraction spherical equivalent, keratometry, or computerized corneal topography readings, but did correlate with length of time until corneal reepithelialization after PTK (P =. 003). Conclusions: PTK resulted in improvements in corneal clarity and visual acuity in most patients with superficial <b>corneal</b> stromal <b>dystrophies.</b> UBM was not an effective tool to accurately measure the depth of corneal pathology preoperatively. The combined approach of minimizing ablation depth and selective use of an antihyperopia treatment resulted in mini-mal mean change in spherical equivalent; however, the range was large.
