5|$|In September 1961, Digital donated a PDP-1 to MIT. Although not an {{expensive}} machine, {{and with a}} tiny (by today's standards) 9K of memory, it had a Type 30 precision <b>CRT</b> <b>display.</b> Dennis oversaw the PDP-1 lab, located {{next door to the}} TX-0. Students from TMRC worked as support staff, programming the new computer.|$|E
5|$|On 24 November 1939, Hanbury Brown wrote a memo on Suggestions for Fighter Control by RDF {{calling for}} {{a new type of}} radar that would {{directly}} display both the target aircraft and the intercepting fighter, allowing ground controllers to directly control the fighter without need for interpretation. The solution was to mount a radar on a motorized platform so it rotated continually, sweeping the entire sky. A motor in the <b>CRT</b> <b>display</b> would rotate the beam deflection plates in synchronicity, so blips seen when the antenna was at a particular angle would be displayed at the same angle on the scope display. Using a phosphor that lasted at least one rotation, blips for all targets within range would be drawn on the display at their correct relative angles, producing a map-like image known as a PPI. With both the bombers and fighters now appearing on the same display, the radar operator could now direct an intercept directly, eliminating all of the delays.|$|E
5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test {{switches on the}} PDP-1 minicomputer, with four switches for each player, but these proved to be awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches. The location of the switches also left one player {{off to one side}} of the <b>CRT</b> <b>display</b> due to the limited space in front of the computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for forward thrust or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a warning that the player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1947 {{invention}} of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game {{as well as the}} first to use an electronic display, the first true video games were created in the early 1950s. Initially created as technology demonstrations, such as the Bertie the Brain and Nimrod computers in 1950 and 1951, video games also became the purview of academic research. A series of games, generally simulating real-world board games, were created at various research institutions to explore programming, human–computer interaction, and computer algorithms. These include OXO and Christopher Strachey's draughts program in 1952, the first software-based games to incorporate a <b>CRT</b> <b>display,</b> and several chess and checkers programs. Possibly the first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958's Tennis for Two, featuring moving graphics on an oscilloscope. As computing technology improved over time, computers became smaller and faster, and the ability to work on them was opened up to university employees and undergraduate students {{by the end of the}} 1950s. These new programmers began to create games for non-academic purposes, leading up to the 1962 release of Spacewar! as one of the earliest known digital computer games to be available outside a single research institute.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Alexander S. Douglas created OXO, a {{software}} program for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC {{was one of the}} first stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human–computer interaction, Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game. The player entered input using a rotary telephone controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer's move would follow. The game was not available to the general public, and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved. Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded. Around the same time, Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer, the Manchester Mark 1, culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a <b>CRT</b> <b>display.</b> Like OXO, the display was mostly static, updating only when a move was made. OXO and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 2000s, <b>CRT</b> <b>display</b> {{technology}} was largely supplanted worldwide by flat-panel displays such as LCD. Flat-panel television, especially LCD, {{has become the}} dominant form of television since the early 2010s.|$|E

50|$|LCDs, {{different}} from {{cathode ray tube}} (<b>CRT)</b> <b>displays,</b> have to use digital signaling to show each pixel. While notebook PCs started replacing <b>CRT</b> <b>displays</b> to LCDs, pixel data were transmitted as parallel data, interface systems found the problem that more than 20 cables were required to transmit data with 18 bits color depth for each 6-bit RGB color as well as lack of space for cables and difficulty of adjusting skews.|$|R
25|$|On December 25, 1926, Kenjiro Takayanagi {{demonstrated}} a TV {{system with a}} 40-line resolution that employed a <b>CRT</b> <b>display</b> at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This was the first working example of a fully electronic television receiver. Takayanagi did not apply for a patent.|$|E
25|$|Complete loss {{of signal}} in an X-Y <b>CRT</b> <b>display</b> means that the beam strikes a small spot, which risks burning the phosphor. Older {{phosphors}} burned more easily. Some dedicated X-Y displays reduce beam current greatly, or blank the display entirely, {{if there are no}} inputs present.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, Kenjiro Takayanagi {{demonstrated}} a CRT television that received images with a 40-line resolution. By 1927, he improved the resolution to 100 lines, which was unrivaled until 1931. By 1928, {{he was the}} first to transmit human faces in half-tones on a <b>CRT</b> <b>display.</b> By 1935, he had invented an early all-electronic CRT television.|$|E

25|$|This {{was to be}} a {{portable}} computer with an integral flat-screen <b>CRT</b> <b>display.</b> Initially to be ZX Spectrum-compatible with a faster Z80 CPU, a built-in ZX Microdrive and a new 512×192-pixel monochrome video mode. Due to the limited size of flat CRT that could be manufactured, a series of folding lenses and mirrors were necessary to magnify the screen image to a usable size. The project was cancelled after the Amstrad take-over, but the Pandora concept eventually transformed into the Cambridge Computer Z88.|$|E
25|$|The {{displays}} {{in the original}} cockpit were all of the traditional analogue/mechanical type {{with the exception of}} an electronic head-up display (HUD), which Saab has claimed makes the Viggen easier to fly, especially at low altitudes during air-to-ground strike missions. Unusually for a 1970s fighter, the JA 37 variant of the Viggen featured three multi-purpose cathode ray tube (<b>CRT)</b> <b>display</b> screens were fitted within the cockpit, in a system called AP-12, developed by Saab and Ericsson. These displays would be used to display processed radar information, computer-generated maps, flight and weapons data, along with steering cues during precision landings.|$|E
25|$|Seven early customers, namely British Airways, Cathay Pacific, KLM, Lufthansa, Northwest, Qantas, and Singapore Airlines, {{formed a}} consultative group to advise Boeing on the 747-400's design process. While the {{aircraft}} was planned as a new-technology upgrade, Boeing originally proposed minimal design changes {{in order to}} reduce development cost and retain commonality with existing models. The airline consultative group sought more advanced changes, including a two-crew glass cockpit. As a result of airline input, the 747-400's new digital cockpit design featured a hybrid of the cathode-ray tube (<b>CRT)</b> <b>display</b> technologies first employed on the 757 and 767, along with carry-over 747 systems such as its autopilot.|$|E

25|$|On December 25, 1925, Kenjiro Takayanagi {{demonstrated}} a television {{system with a}} 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and <b>CRT</b> <b>display</b> at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This prototype is still {{on display at the}} Takayanagi Memorial Museum at Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu Campus. By 1927, Takayanagi improved the resolution to 100 lines, which was unrivaled until 1931. By 1928, {{he was the first to}} transmit human faces in halftones. His work had an influence on the later work of Vladimir K. Zworykin. By 1935, Takayanagi had invented the first all-electronic television. His research toward creating a production model was halted by the US after Japan lost World War II.|$|E
25|$|The Wang was not {{the first}} CRT-based machine nor were all of its {{innovations}} unique to Wang. In the early 1970s Linolex, Lexitron and Vydec introduced pioneering word-processing systems with <b>CRT</b> <b>display</b> editing. A Canadian electronics company, Automatic Electronic Systems, had introduced a product in 1972, but went into receivership a year later. In 1976, refinanced by the Canada Development Corporation, it returned to operation as AES Data, and went on to successfully market its brand of word processors worldwide until its demise in the mid-1980s. Its first office product, the AES-90, combined {{for the first time a}} CRT-screen, a floppy-disk and a microprocessor, that is, the very same winning combination that would be used by IBM for its PC seven years later. The AES-90 software was able to handle French and English typing from the start, displaying and printing the texts side-by-side, a Canadian government requirement. The first eight units were delivered to the office of the then Prime Minister, Pierre Elliot Trudeau, in February 1974.|$|E
25|$|The {{degaussing}} circuit {{is often}} built of a thermo-electric (not electronic) device containing a small ceramic heating element {{and a positive}} thermal coefficient (PTC) resistor, connected directly to the switched AC power line with the resistor in series with the degaussing coil. When the power is switched on, the heating element heats the PTC resistor, increasing its resistance {{to a point where}} degaussing current is minimal, but not actually zero. In older CRT displays, this low-level current (which produces no significant degaussing field) is sustained along with the action of the heating element as long as the display remains switched on. To repeat a degaussing cycle, the <b>CRT</b> <b>display</b> must be switched off and left off for at least several seconds to reset the degaussing circuit by allowing the PTC resistor to cool to the ambient temperature; switching the display-off and immediately back on will result in a weak degaussing cycle or effectively no degaussing cycle.|$|E

500|$|Bowen {{then started}} looking for a {{suitable}} receiver system, and immediately had a stroke of good luck; EMI had recently constructed a prototype receiver for the experimental BBC television broadcasts on 6.7m wavelength (45MHz). The receiver used seven or eight vacuum tubes (valves) on a chassis only [...] in height and about [...] long. Combined with a <b>CRT</b> <b>display,</b> the entire system weighed only [...] Bowen later described it as [...] "far and away better than anything which [...] been achieved in Britain up to that time." ...|$|E
500|$|Production of the Classic was {{prompted}} {{by the success of}} the Macintosh Plus and the Macintosh SE. The system specifications of the Classic were very similar to its predecessors, with the same [...] monochrome <b>CRT</b> <b>display,</b> 512×342pixel resolution, and 4megabyte (MB) memory limit of the older Macintosh computers. Apple's decision to not update the Classic with newer technology such as a 68010 CPU, higher RAM capacity or color display resulted in criticism from reviewers, with MacWorld describing it as having [...] "nothing to gloat about beyond its low price" [...] and [...] "unexceptional". But, it ensured compatibility with the Mac's by-then healthy software base as well as enabled it to fit the lower price Apple intended for it. Nevertheless, the Classic featured several improvements over the aging Macintosh Plus, which it replaced as Apple's low-end Mac computer. It was up to 25percent faster than the Plus and included an Apple SuperDrive [...] floppy disk drive as standard.|$|E
500|$|Douglas {{used the}} EDSAC to {{simulate}} {{a game of}} noughts and crosses, also called tic-tac-toe, and display {{the state of the}} game on the screen. Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded. Douglas did not give the game a name beyond [...] "noughts and crosses"; the name OXO first appeared as the name of the simulation file created by computer historian Martin Campbell-Kelly while creating a simulation of the EDSAC several decades later. Around the same time that OXO was completed, Christopher Strachey expanded a draughts program he had originally written in 1951 and ported it to the Ferranti Mark 1, which showed the state of the game on a <b>CRT</b> <b>display.</b> OXO and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen, though it is unclear which of the two games was displayed first. As it ran on a computing device and used a graphical display, OXO is considered under some definitions to be a contender for the first video game, though under others it does not due to its lack of moving graphics or graphics which update continuously.|$|E
40|$|Experiments, {{including}} our own (Gould et al., 1984; 1986), {{have shown that}} people read more slowly from <b>CRT</b> <b>displays</b> than i'rom paper. A series of exper-iments shows that the explanation centers on the image quality of the characters. Reading speeds, equivalent to those on paper, have been found for <b>CRT</b> <b>displays</b> containing character fonts that resemble those on paper (rather than dot matrix fonts, for example), that have a polarity of dark characters on a light background, that are anti-aliased (i. e., contain grey level), and that are shown on displays with relatively high resolution (e. g., 1000 x 800) ...|$|R
5000|$|CVT timings {{include the}} {{necessary}} pauses in picture data (known as [...] "blanking intervals") to allow <b>CRT</b> <b>displays</b> to reposition their electron beam {{at the end}} of each horizontal scan line, as well as the vertical repositioning necessary {{at the end of}} each frame. CVT also specifies a mode ("CVT-R") which significantly reduces these blanking intervals (to a period insufficient for <b>CRT</b> <b>displays</b> to work correctly) in the interests of saving video signal bandwidth when modern displays such as LCD monitors are being used, since such displays typically do not require these pauses in the picture data.|$|R
