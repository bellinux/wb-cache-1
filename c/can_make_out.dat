5|$|In the foundry, Joule is able {{to analyze}} the {{prismatic}} core. She <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> voices coming from the core – including her father's – thus deducing {{that it is a}} transmission of sorts. Heading to Eden Tower to decrypt the core's transmission, she agrees to meet Kai there. Once reunited, they are ambushed by Victor. Kai stays behind to provide Joule the time to escape. She finds a lost crawler filled with parietal art indicating that Victor had manipulated the other corebots to attack the maintenance habitats. Corebot Duncan enters, lamenting the death of his human companion, and unites with Joule against Victor. Joule approaches Eden Tower to activate it, only to be faced with Victor and his minions. She learns that the ships, once orbiting Far Eden while waiting for its terraforming to complete, are long gone, having been destroyed by Victor. He throws Kai's prosthetic leg to the ground, proclaiming him dead. Finally, Joule bests Victor in combat and activates the terraforming system, materializing a hologram of her father from parts of memories hidden in the cores. In the end, it becomes clear that Kai survived his confrontation with Victor.|$|E

Moving closer, they can see first that it is a ship, then that it is a warship, and then that it is a Dellacondan warship. Finally, they <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> clearly the ship’s insignia – the famous markings of Corsarius, Christoper Sim’s own.|$|E

500|$|Gordimer remarked that, {{more than}} just a story about white communists in South Africa, Burger's Daughter is about [...] "commitment" [...] and what she as a writer does to [...] "make sense of life". After Mandela and Fischer were sentenced in the mid-1960s, Gordimer {{considered}} going into exile, but she changed her mind and later recalled [...] "I wouldn't be accepted as I was here, even in the worst times and even though I'm white". Just as Rosa struggles to find her place as a white in the anti-apartheid liberation movement, so did Gordimer. In an interview in 1980, she said that [...] "when we have got beyond the apartheid situation—there's a tremendous problem for whites, unless whites are allowed in by blacks, and unless we <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> a case for our being accepted and we can forge a common culture together, whites are going to be marginal".|$|E
500|$|The Lake previewed in Washington, D.C., {{where there}} was a large advance sale. Harris's poor {{direction}} had eroded Hepburn's confidence, and she struggled with the performance. Despite this, Harris moved the play to New York without further rehearsal. It opened at the Martin Beck Theatre on December 26, 1933, and Hepburn was roundly panned by the critics. Dorothy Parker quipped, [...] "She runs the gamut of emotions all the way from A to B." [...] Already tied to a ten-week contract, she had to endure the embarrassment of rapidly declining box office sales. Harris decided to take the show to Chicago, saying to Hepburn, [...] "My dear, the only interest I have in you is the money I <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> of you." [...] Hepburn refused, and paid Harris $14,000 to close the production instead. She later referred to Harris as [...] "hands-down the most diabolical person I have ever met", and claimed this experience was important in teaching her to take responsibility for her career.|$|E
500|$|Although her {{research}} was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was {{not satisfied with}} her position at the University. She recalled being excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions. In 1940, she wrote to Charles Burnham, [...] "I have decided that I must look for another job. As far as I <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> {{there is nothing more}} for me here. I am an assistant professor at $3,000 and I feel sure that that is the limit for me." [...] Initially, McClintock's position was created especially for her by Stadler, and might have depended on his presence at the university. McClintock believed she would not gain tenure at Missouri, even though according to some accounts, she knew she would be offered a promotion from Missouri in the spring of 1942. Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the University administration, after discovering that her job would be in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for Caltech, as he had considered doing. The university's retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments.|$|E

This small reptile {{may have}} had long paired feather-like scales on its back, however {{it has been more}} {{recently}} argued that the scales form just a single dorsal frill.

His commentary is also peppered with the statistics and conversations that he has imbibed over the last 20 years.|$|E

2500|$|Stanley Wells {{is one of}} the few biographers {{to comment}} on the poem, saying that it [...] "somewhat cryptically calls on the passer-by to pay tribute to his greatness as a writer", and admitting [...] "the only sense I <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> of the last bit is that his {{compositions}} relegate the sculptor's art to the rank of a mere page – with perhaps a forced pun on the writer's 'pages' – offering service to his genius; or perhaps that all art subsequent to Shakespeare's is a page – servant – to his."

2500|$|Like James, the 1869 article [...] "Table Talk" [...] in Once a Week did {{not view}} the {{characters}} in Our Mutual Friend as realistic.

As far as we <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> no. We have been at some trouble to inquire from men who should know; watermen, who have lived on the river nigh all their lives, if they have seen late at night a dark boat with a solitary occupant, drifting down the river on the 'look out,' plying his frightful trade? The answer has uniformly been 'No, we have never seen such men,' and more, they do not believe in their existence." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} is often asked, how {{the cab and}} omnibus proprietors take to these innovations. Of course not very kindly, but experience shows that these individuals are more frightened than hurt. At first {{there is a little}} loss of revenue to the cabmen, but in the end the result is no worse, as people get educated to riding everywhere, and cabs get a fair share. The railways were said to have struck a death-blow at the ordinary vehicle traffic, but such did not prove to be true, and, wherever tramways have opened there has been no decrease in the numbers of cabs - Leicester for instance. Since the company have been running per timetable, the bus proprietors {{have done the same thing}} along St. Ann's Well-road, and with good result. For the comfort of the shareholders of the company, it may be stated that the directors will no doubt pay in July (with the interim dividend paid in February), a dividend at the rate of six per cent per annum. When this is taken into full consideration - that is to say, when all the difficulties are duly allowed for, and it is remembered that only a portion of the line is as yet opened - the result is most satisfactory. Indeed all the shares are now quoted at two per cent premium with few vendors. As to the character of the company, I think it is not undue flattery to say that it is efficiently and economically managed as the staff is limited to the mere necessary officials, and the directorate is small. Considering the rail employed is one that is sure to result in great saving to the shareholders, seeing that there will be little or no cost of repairs, and taking into consideration also the fact that the tramway route is populous, and the working expenses small, there is every reason to prophecy success to the company [...] [...] [...] As far as we <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the estimated weekly receipts of the Tramway Company amount to about £350, and in Whit week we believe as much as £430 was taken, for which upwards of 50,000 people were carried. Taking £350 as the average weekly receipts gives a total of over £17,000 in a year, which is a very large sum indeed for the present branch of tramway service in a town of such proportions as Nottingham [...] [...] [...] There are 212 cabs in the town, so that estimating the earnings at but £2 per week there is a total of £424 weekly, or £20,000 a year. Taking the above as a very moderate estimate, and making a little allowance for omnibuses, 'carriers' carts, , it is fair to suppose that at least £40,000 a year is spent in Nottingham for passenger traffic.|$|E
