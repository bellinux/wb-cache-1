It is the original work of the author except where indicated by reference. This thesis describes the continuation of the development of Echo Volumar Imaging (EVI) to facilitate snapshot imaging of a volume within the human body. Variants of the technique which have also been investigated include a spin echo version, SE-EVI, and a zoomed version ZEVI. All formats acquired data in a modulus fashion in times ranging from 64 ms to 120 ms. Hardware limitations have restricted the image matrix size to 64 x 32 x 8 voxels and prompted the employment of more efficient gradient driver circuitry. A multi-mode resonant gradient circuit is described for use in both Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) and EVI. The circuit behaves in an overall resonant manner but at a fixed number of discrete frequencies. By choosing the number of resonant modes, the circuit can be used to generate approximations to a square wave or trapezoidal waveform. Because of the energy conserving nature of the circuit design much faster <b>current</b> <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> can be achieved with a given amplifier and gradient coil.

The model in-cludes the entire head geometry, with the large return pole and the soft underlayer. The response of the head to the coil current is de-termined by the current waveform shape and duration, Gilbert damping constant, and presence of soft underlayer and shields. Large damping leads to a large phase shift between the coil current and the head field while small damping causes strong gyromagnetic precession. We find that an intermediate value of the damping con-stant gives the fastest head field rise time. The intrinsic reversal time decreases from 540 to 250 ps by reducing coil-turns from two to one and shortening the yoke length.
