5000|$|Heliotropium arborescens, {{the garden}} heliotrope, {{is a highly}} {{fragrant}} perennial plant, originally from Peru. [...] It is especially notable for its intense, rather vanilla-like fragrance. Common names include cherry pie and <b>common</b> <b>heliotrope.</b> Note that the common name [...] "garden heliotrope" [...] may also refer to Valerian (herb), {{which is not a}} heliotropium variety.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the potential transfer of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), laying hens were fed for 14 days with diets containing 0. 5 % of dried common ragwort, common groundsel, narrow-leaved ragwort or viper’s bugloss, or 0. 1 % of <b>common</b> <b>heliotrope.</b> This resulted in total PA levels in feed of respectively 5. 5, 11. 1, 53. 1, 5. 9 and 21. 7 mg kg – 1, with varying composition. PAs {{were transferred to}} eggs, in particular yolk, with steady-state levels of respectively 12, 21, 216, 2 and 36 µg kg – 1. Overall transfer rates for the sum of PAs were estimated between 0. 02 % and 0. 23 %, {{depending on the type}} of PAs in the feed. In animals slaughtered shortly after the last exposure, levels in meat were slightly lower than those in eggs, levels in livers somewhat higher. When switched to clean feed, levels in eggs gradually decreased, but after 14 days were still above detection limits in the hens exposed to higher PA levels. Similar was the case for meat and especially kidneys and livers. It is concluded that the intake of PA containing herbs by laying hens may result in levels in eggs and meat that could be of concern for consumers, and as such should be avoided. </p...|$|E

50|$|Astragalus montii is a {{rare species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the legume family known by the <b>common</b> name <b>heliotrope</b> milkvetch. It is endemic to Utah in the United States, where {{there are only three}} known populations. It is a federally listed threatened species of the United States. This species is often treated as a variety of Astragalus limnocharis.|$|R
50|$|Heliotropium europaeum is {{a species}} of {{heliotrope}} known by the <b>common</b> names European <b>heliotrope</b> and European turn-sole. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, but it is widely naturalized elsewhere, such as in Australia and North America. It grows as a roadside weed in some places. This is an annual herb growing from a taproot and reaching maximum heights near 40 centimeters. The stem and oval-shaped leaves are covered in soft hairs. The inflorescences are coiled spikes of white flowers with fuzzy or bristly sepals. Each flower {{is just a few}} millimeters wide. The fruit is a bumpy nutlet.|$|R
