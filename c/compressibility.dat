25|$|In {{solving a}} subsonic problem, one {{decision}} {{to be made by}} the aerodynamicist is whether to incorporate the effects of <b>compressibility.</b> <b>Compressibility</b> is a description of the amount of change of density in the flow. When the effects of <b>compressibility</b> on the solution are small, the assumption that density is constant may be made. The problem is then an incompressible low-speed aerodynamics problem. When the density is allowed to vary, the flow is called compressible. In air, <b>compressibility</b> effects are usually ignored when the Mach number in the flow does not exceed 0.3 (about 335 feet (102m) per second or 228 miles (366km) per hour at 60°F (16°C)).
