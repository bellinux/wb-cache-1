6000|$|I {{hope the}} summer's end finds you {{still out of}} the streets, {{and that it has}} all been a {{comfortable}} chapter. I hear of it from my brother as the Great <b>Cool</b> <b>Time,</b> which makes for me a pleasant image, since I generally seem to sear my eyeballs, from June to September, when I steal a glance, across the sea, at the bright American picture. Here, of course, we have been as grey and cold, as [...] "braced" [...] and rheumatic and uncomfortable as you please. But that has little charm of novelty--though (not to blaspheme) we have, since I've been living here, occasionally perspired. I live here, as you see, still, and am by this time, like the dyer's hand, subdued to what I work in, or at least try to economise in. It is pleasant enough, for five or six months of the year, for me to wish immensely that some crowning stroke of fortune may still take the form of driving you over to see me before I fall to pieces. Apropos of which I am forgetting what has been half my reason--no, not half--for writing to you. Many weeks ago there began to be blown about the world--from what fountain of lies proceeding I know not--a rumour that you were staying with me here, a rumour flaunting its little hour as large as life in some of the London papers. It brought me many notes of inquiry, invitations to you, and other tributes to your glory--damn it! (I don't mean damn your glory, but damn the wanton and worrying rumour). Among other things it brought me a fattish letter addressed to you and which I have been so beastly procrastinating as not to forward you till now, when I post it with this. Its aspect somehow denotes insignificance and impertinence, and I haven't wanted to do it, {{as a part of the}} so grossly newspaperistic impudence, too much honour; besides, verily, the intention day after day of writing you at the same time. Well, there it all is. You will think my letter as long as my book. So I add only my benediction, as ever, on your house, beginning with Mrs. Howells, going straight through, and ramifying as far as you permit me.|$|E

40|$|Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play a {{key role}} in {{measuring}} cosmological parameters, in which the Phillips relation is adopted. However, the origin of the relation is still unclear. Several parameters are suggested, e. g. the relative content of carbon to oxygen (C/O) and the central density of the white dwarf (WD) at ignition. These parameters are mainly determined by the WD's initial mass and its <b>cooling</b> <b>time,</b> respectively. Using the progenitor model developed by Meng and Yang, we present the distributions of the initial WD mass and the <b>cooling</b> <b>time.</b> We do not find any correlation between these parameters. However, we notice that the range of the WD's mass decreases, while its average value increases with the <b>cooling</b> <b>time.</b> These results could provide a constraint when simulating the SN Ia explosion, i. e. the WDs with a high C/O ratio usually have a lower central density at ignition, while those having the highest central density at ignition generally have a lower C/O ratio.

40|$|The {{goals of}} this study are to {{increase}} the accuracy and consistency of the simulated results of the Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) cooling analysis software for injection molding and to develop a relative <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> table for commonly used thermoplastics. The CAE cooling analysis software will then be useful in increasing the efficiency of design and manufacturing. The relative <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> table will be useful to selected the appropriate material {{in order to reduce the}} production cost. ^ Due to the lack of knowledge about thermal contact resistance and specification of process parameter inputs of Polycool II [...] a cooling simulation software for injection molding, the simulation data of Polycool II have a very poor agreement with the field or experimental data. This work addresses these issues. This study is comprised of the following components: to obtain the thermal contact resistance (TCR) between the injection molded part and the mold; to determine the ejection temperature of the parts; to study how process parameters affect TCR and ejection temperature; to study the relative <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> of material; and to study the effects of using a specific material on the production cost. ^ Experiments were conducted to obtain temperature distributions, <b>cooling</b> <b>time,</b> part thickness, and the inside cavity pressure distributions for a large number of injection molded parts. The temperature distribution was used as the boundary condition in the thermal analysis for each experiment. The <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> data were used to determine the ejection temperature, to formulate an equation for obtaining the relative <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> for the materials not included in the experiments, and to develop the relative <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> table. The relative <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> is defined as the ratio of the <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> of the material to the <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> of general purpose Polystyrene (PS) where both materials are used to produce the same part. The inside cavity pressure distributions provided the information needed to explain the TCR behavior. ^ Thermal analyses were performed to obtain the bulk temperature distributions of the parts and the thermal contact resistance (TCR) between the parts and the mold. The bulk temperature distribution was used to determine the ejection temperature, which is defined as the bulk temperature of part at the moment when the part is ejected. The TCR data were used in Polycool II and significantly increased the accuracy and consistency of the simulated data. The significant improvement of the simulated results has been demonstrated by using three examples. ...|$|R

5000|$|... "On My Own" [...] {{was written}} by Yasmin, Ian Greenidge and its {{producer}} Andre Williams, {{who goes by the}} stage name of Shy FX. Yasmin's DJ'ing experience enriched her with A&R knowledge which allowed her to choose and meet up with Shy FX to produce [...] "On My Own". She knew Shy FX from her time as a DJ and was a fan of his work, and later phoned him for a studio session. Speaking to Alex Andrews of Gigwise, Yasmin elaborated on her love for Shy FX's production style, [...] "I don't have to say much to him, he just knows exactly what to do." [...] She was then signed to Levels Entertainment and Ministry of Sound on 1 April 2010. She then achieved her first commercial success when she featured on Devlin's 2010 single [...] "Runaway", which peaked at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart. Inspired by these events leading up to the launch of her solo career, Yasmin wrote [...] "On My Own". The song was very personal to Yasmin as it represented her journey in the music industry. Writing about the independence themes of the song, Semper Azeez-Harris of Blues & Soul mentioned that Yasmin's path was not followed by the formulaic [...] "I {{always wanted to be a}} singer" [...] mould, adding, [...] "Whilst a love for music is the prerequisite for wanting to be a singer the fact that she chose the male dominated world of DJ'ing initially as a way to satiate that love of music, epitomises her independence streak." [...] Speaking to Azeez-Harris, Yasmin explained how she was constantly patronised when DJ-ing, [...] "In a lot of scenarios I have been at gigs where people have not heard me before but once I get on the decks people cannot tell me that I do not deserve to be on there." [...] She was also inspired by music of the 1990s during the song's development, naming Massive Attack, Madonna and All Saints as some of the acts which influenced the track. In the Daily Record report, Yasmin mentioned, [...] "1990s was a really <b>cool</b> <b>time,</b> with a lot of mood and vibe in the music, recently a lot music is very samey, it's nice to be able to go back to a mood and groove." [...] She wanted [...] "On My Own" [...] to be [...] "fresh but familiar, new school but old school." [...] Her experience as a DJ in Glasgow is manifested in the song's lyrics. One particular experience was explained by Yasmin, [...] "Because of being there I was not fazed by the flashy London business - champagne, footballers and models, ... you did it because you loved it but here a lot of people get into it because they wanted that lifestyle." [...] Speaking to Live Magazine, Yasmin said that [...] "On My Own" [...] is about being brave, taking risks, looking after yourself and making things happen for yourself. She added: [...] "I think when someone is fine being on their own and being in their own company that's strong. My friend's mum always used to stay stuff to us, because my friend is a stylist and I was doing what I was doing so we would message each other and be like oh my god I'm just sitting for lunch on my own - how embarrassing but my friend's mum would say it takes a very strong person to sit in a restaurant on their own."

We show {{that if the}} filling factor {{is assumed to be}} unity, the calculated conductive <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> are much shorter than the observed flare decay times, which in turn are much shorter than the calculated radiative <b>cooling</b> <b>times.</b> This is likely unphysical, but the contradic- tion can be resolved by assuming the radiative and conductive <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> are comparable, which is valid when the flare loop temperature is a maximum and when external heating can be ignored. We find that resultant radiative and con- ductive <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> are comparable to observed decay times, which has been used as an assumption in some previous studies. The inferred electron densities have a mean value of 10 ^ 11. 6 cm^- 3 and filling factors have a mean of 10 ^- 3. 7.

40|$|We derive X-ray mass, luminosity, and {{temperature}} profiles for 45 galaxy clusters to explore relationships between halo mass, AGN feedback, and central <b>cooling</b> <b>time.</b> We find that radio [...] mechanical feedback power (referred to here as "AGN power") in central cluster galaxies correlates with halo mass as P_ mech ∝ M^ 1. 55 ± 0. 26, {{but only in}} halos with central atmospheric <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> shorter than 1 Gyr. The trend of AGN power with halo mass {{is consistent with the}} scaling expected from a self-regulating AGN feedback loop, as well as with galaxy and central black hole co-evolution along the M_ BH - σ relation. AGN power in clusters with central atmospheric <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> longer than ∼ 1 Gyr typically lies two orders of magnitude below those with shorter central <b>cooling</b> <b>times.</b> Galaxies centred in clusters with long central <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> nevertheless experience ongoing and occasionally powerful AGN outbursts. We further investigate the impact of feedback on cluster scaling relations. We find L-T, and M-T relations in clusters with direct evidence of feedback which are steeper than self-similar, but not atypical compared to previous studies of the full cluster population. While the gas mass rises, the stellar mass remains nearly constant with rising total mass, consistent with earlier studies. This trend is found regardless of central <b>cooling</b> <b>time,</b> implying tight regulation of star formation in central galaxies as their halos grew, and long-term balance between AGN heating and atmospheric cooling. Our scaling relations are presented in forms that can be incorporated easily into galaxy evolution models. Comment: 26 pages, 13 figures, accepted in MNRA...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{reported}} results (Konn et al. [14]) on the collisional cooling {{of atmospheric}} pressure matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (AP-MALDI) and nano-electrospray ionization (nano-ESI) generated ions in a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (QITMS) are inconsistent with measured collisional cooling rates. The work reported here presents a re-examination of those previous results. Collision induced dissociation (CID) {{has been used}} to probe various properties of ions contained in a QITMS. It is shown experimentally that when trapping large numbers of ions, an effective dc trapping voltage is induced that varies with changes {{in the size of the}} ion cloud. A decrease in the resonant frequency for maximum CID efficiency is observed as the <b>cool</b> <b>time</b> between parent ion isolation and CID is increased. Ion trajectories in a QITMS are simulated to demonstrate how ion density changes over the course of parent ion isolation. The effect of space charge on ion motion is simulated, and Fourier transformations of ion axial motion plus simple calculations corroborate the experimentally observed transient frequency shifts. The relative stability of ions formed by AP-MALDI and nano-ESI is compared under low charge density conditions. These data show that the ions have reached equilibrium internal energy and, thus, that differences in dissociation onsets and “ 50 % fragmentation efficiency points” between the ionization mechanisms are due to the formation of distinct ion conformations as previously shown in reference [28]. The conclusions of Konn et al. [14] are based on invalid experimental procedures as well as inappropriate comparisons of QITMS data to low-pressure FT-ICR data...|$|E
40|$|Radio lobes {{inflated}} by active galactic nuclei at {{the centers}} of clusters are a promising candidate for halting condensation in clusters with short central <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> because they are common in such clusters. In order to test the AGNheating hypothesis, we obtained Chandra observations of two clusters with short central <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> yet no evidence for AGN activity: Abell 1650 and Abell 2244. The cores of these clusters indeed appear systematically different from cores with more prominent radio emission. They do not have significant central temperature gradients, and their central entropy levels are markedly higher than in clusters with stronger radio emission, corresponding to central <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> ∼ 1 Gyr. Also, {{there is no evidence}} for fossil X-ray cavities produced by an earlier episode of AGN heating. We suggest that either (1) the central gas has not yet cooled to the point at which feedback is necessary to prevent it from condensing, possibly because it is conductively stabilized, or (2) the gas experienced a major heating event � 1 Gyr in the past and has not required feedback since then. The fact that these clusters with no evident feedback have higher central entropy and therefore longer central <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> than clusters with obvious AGN feedback strongly suggests that AGNs supply the feedback necessary to suppress condensation in clusters with short central <b>cooling</b> <b>times.</b> – 2...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of 20 galaxy clusters observed with the Chandra X-ray satellite, focussing on the temperature structure of the intracluster medium and the <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> of the gas. Our sample is drawn from a flux-limited catalogue but excludes the Fornax, Coma and Centaurus clusters, owing to their large angular size compared to the Chandra field-of-view. We describe a quantitative measure {{of the impact of}} central cooling, and find that the sample comprises 9 clusters possessing cool cores and 11 without. The properties of these two types differ markedly, but there is a high degree of uniformity amongst the cool core clusters, which obey a nearly universal radial scaling in temperature of the form T ∝ r^ 0. 4, within the core. This uniformity persists in the gas <b>cooling</b> <b>time,</b> which varies more strongly with radius in cool core clusters (t_cool ∝ r^ 1. 3), reaching t_cool < 1 Gyr in all cases, although surprisingly low central <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> (< 5 Gyr) are found in many of the non-cool core systems. The scatter between the <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> profiles of all the clusters is found to be remarkably small, implying a universal form for the <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> of gas at a given physical radius in virialized systems, in agreement with recent previous work.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of recent {{numerical}} simulations of the head-on merger of a cooling flow cluster with an infalling subcluster of galaxies. These simulations {{examined the effects of}} different types of cluster mergers (with 16 : 1 and 4 : 1 mass ratios) on the evolution of cluster cooling flows (mass accretion rates of 100 and 400 M/year. The 2 -dimensional simulations were performed with a Hydro/N-body code on a uniform grid with a resolution of 20 kpc. We find that the ram-pressure of the infalling gas is crucial in determining the fate of the cooling flow as disruption occurs when a substantial amount of subcluster gas reaches the primary's core. In such cases, the subcluster gas can increase the central <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> by displacing the high-density cooling gas and by heating it via shocks and turbulent gas motions. Moreover, the fate of a merging cooling flow is also dependent on its initial <b>cooling</b> <b>time.</b> In cases where the initial <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> is very small then, even if the flow is disrupted, the central <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> will remain less than a Hubble time and the flow will likely re-establish itself. This has an important observational consequence because such clusters will be classified as cooling flows even though they have experienced a significant merger. In addition, there is a time delay (1 - 2 Gyrs) between core-crossing and {{the point at which the}} central <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> of a disrupted flow becomes of order a Hubble time (abridged) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Accurate <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> {{calculation}} {{is needed}} for cost estimation of injection moulded parts. Many <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> formulae for injection moulding contain errors, though {{they may have been}} used and accepted for decades. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review the available formulae and to clarify correctness from a theoretical standpoint. Ejection criteria may be based either on mid-plane or average temperature. Deviation from the assumptions of the theory for both thin and thick parts is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{investigation}} of weldability of ultra-high strength steel has been presented. The thermal simulated samples were used to investigate the effect of welding <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> t 8 / 5 on microstructure and mechanical properties of heat affected zone (HAZ) for a Weldox 1300 ultra-high strength steel. In the frame of these investigation the microstructure was studied by light and transmission electron microscopies. Mechanical properties of parent material were analysed by tensile, impact and hardness tests. In details the influence of <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> {{in the range of}} 2, 5 ÷ 300 sec. on hardness, impact toughness and microstructure of simulated HAZ was studied by using welding thermal simulation test. The microstructure of ultra-high strength steel is mainly composed of tempered martensite. The results show that the impact toughness and hardness decrease with increase of t 8 / 5 under condition of a single thermal cycle in simulated HAZ. The increase of <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> to 300 s causes that the microstructure consists of ferrite and bainite mixture. Lower hardness, for t 8 / 5 ≥ 60 s indicated that low risk of cold cracking in HAZ for longer <b>cooling</b> <b>time,</b> exists...|$|R
