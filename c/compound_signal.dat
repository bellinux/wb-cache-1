Specifically, {{this article focuses}} on more complex and realistic scenarios than our previous study in [10]. In this article, we consider the coordination of not only the transmitters’ carrier phase offsets but also their transmit power levels. In this system, a receiver with MPR capability performs multiuser detection and then estimates the symbol energy and the carrier phase offset for each transmitter’s <b>signal</b> from the <b>compound</b> <b>signals.</b> Next, the receiver piggybacks the optimal transmit power level and carrier phase shift, which is the difference between the estimated carrier phase offset and an optimal carrier phase offset, to the corresponding transmitters so that they can adjust their transmit power and carrier phase offset to the optimal value when transmitting signals. To determine the optimal transmit power level and carrier phase shift, we formulate an optimization problem in order to maximize the minimum Euclidean distance between the constellation coordinates of the <b>compound</b> <b>signals.</b> We subsequently evaluate the performance of the proposed transmit power level and carrier phase adjustment scheme and compare it to that of the no adjustment case for QPSK and 8 PSK with 2 – 4 transmitters. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the error probability for all cases investigated in our simulation scenarios.|$|R

30|$|In both {{scenarios}} {{considered in}} this paper, {{in the primary}} system—DVB-T broadcast system on the one hand, IEEE 802.11 a/g networks on the other—the signal is modulated using Orthogonal Frequency Digital Multiplexing (OFDM); see, for example, [16]. The OFDM signal is a <b>compound</b> <b>signal</b> consisting of multiple frequency carriers, also called subcarriers or tones, that are each modulated in phase or in phase and amplitude. From a practical outlook, the modulated tones are multiplexed at the transmitter using an inverse FFT. Conversely, the subcarriers are de-multiplexed at the receiver end by an FFT. The size of the FFT N, which defines that of the OFDM symbols, depends on the system. In the case of IEEE 802.11 a/g systems, 64 subcarriers are used whereas the DVB-T signal uses 1024, 2048, 4096, or 8192 tones. In order to avoid intersymbol interference, a Guard Interval (GI) is introduced. In the case of OFDM, this GI is designed as {{a copy of the}} last samples of the OFDM symbol. This approach provides the symbol with a cyclic nature which simplifies the receiver. For this reason, this D long GI is called the Cyclic Prefix (CP).|$|E

Traditionally, the operator’s attention is drawn to the reduction in dynamic range and the sonic signature imposed by the envelope (settings) of the device, and the resulting distortions are familiar to studio practitioners.

Comparative quantitative analysis of compressed simple and <b>compound</b> <b>signal</b> structures shows the products of this distortion to be realignment of harmonic structure, reduction of spectral and temporal clarity, and rearrangement of dynamic variances related to the rhythmic structure of musical signals.

40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a novel technique {{that can be}} used as an indicator of the number of active signal sources in convolutive signal mixtures. The technique is designed so that the number of sources is estimated using only recorded signals and some marginal information, such as possible minimum and maximum triggering frequencies of sources, but no information on mixing matrix, other parameters of signal sources, etc. Our research is based on the convolution kernel compensation method (CKC), which is a blind source separation method. First, a correlation matrix of the recorded signals is estimated. Next, a measure of the global activity of the signal sources, called activity index, is introduced. The exact analytical model of the activity index variance was derived for the purpose of the estimation of the number of signal sources. Using the analytical model, the number of active signal sources can be estimated if some a priori marginal information is available. We evaluated these marginal parameter values in extensive simulations of <b>compound</b> <b>signals.</b> The number of sources, their lengths, signal-to-noise ratio, source triggerings, and the number of measurements were randomly combined in preselected ranges. By using the established marginal parameter values and increasing extension factors, the model of the activity index variance was deployed to estimate the number of signal sources. The estimation results using synthetic signal mixtures are very promising.

Signal features of a few uV amplitude and less than 5 milliseconds (ms) duration could be reliably distinguished. Measured P waves had 4 to 5 separate peaks that were reproducible between recordings. Simulated P waves demonstrated similar complexity, which was related to structural discontinuities in the computer model of the atria.

Such a measurement consists in digitizing a <b>compound</b> <b>signal,</b> performing windowing of the signal samples and computing their discrete magnitude spectrum, usually by means of the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. Frequencies of individual components can be evaluated from their locations in the discrete spectrum with a resolution depending on the number of samples. However, the frequency of a sinusoidal component can be determined with improved resolution by fitting an interpolating parabola through the three largest consecutive spectrum bins corresponding to the component. The abscissa of its maximum constitutes a better frequency approximation. Such a method has been used for tune measurement systems in circular accelerators. This paper describes the efficiency of the method, depending on the windowing function applied to the signal samples. A typical interpolation gain is one order of magnitude. Better results are obtained with Gaussian interpolation, offering frequency resolution improvement by more than two orders of magnitude when used with windows having fast sidelobe decay. An improvement beyond three orders of magnitude is possible with steep Gaussian windows. These results are confirmed by laboratory measurements.
