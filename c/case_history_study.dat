The aim of the present work is to perform a retrospective <b>case</b> <b>history</b> <b>study</b> to assess patients with con papillary ca. who have been treated surgically over the last 17 years and {{have been subjected to}} periodic checks. A sample of patients was therefore extrapolated who had all undergone total thyroidectomy for papillary ca. of the thyroid. The incidence of local recurrence of the disease was verified, together with the results at distance. Furthermore, the assessments performed were evaluated and compared. From the sample of patients observed we inferred that papillary carcinoma of the thyroid can have a good prognosis over time provided periodic random checks are carried out...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{discrimination}} {{refers to}} discrimination directed against {{an individual or}} family based solely on an apparent or perceived genetic variation from the "normal" human genotype. We describe here {{the results of a}} <b>case</b> <b>history</b> <b>study</b> designed to assess whether or not genetic discrimination exists. Using the above definition of genetic discrimination and applying stringent criteria for case selection, we find that genetic discrimination exists and is manifested in many social institutions, especially in the health and life insurance industries. Stigmatization, and denial of services or entitlements to individuals who have a genetic diagnosis but who are asymptomatic or who will never become significantly impaired, is noted. Follow-up comprehensive studies on the significance and varieties of genetic discrimination are needed. In order to avoid creating a new social underclass based on genetic discrimination (the "asymptomatic ill"), existing and future genetic testing or screening programs need review by medical, scientific, legal, and social policy experts, as well as the public, and may require modification...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of a positive family history as a primary risk factor for coronary heart disease was examined in a <b>case</b> <b>history</b> <b>study.</b> Of 792 consecutive male patients aged under 60 years who survived a first episode of unstable angina or myocardial infarction, 326 had a negative family history, 298 had a positive history, and in 168 a family history could not be established with certainty. There {{was no significant difference}} in the distribution of the three primary coronary risk factors [...] cigarette smoking, hypertension, and hypercholesterolaemia [...] between those with and those without a positive family history. The 133 subjects with a positive family history of premature coronary heart disease (occurrence in near relatives under 60 years) were significantly younger than those with a negative family history. It is concluded that there is little evidence to confirm a positive family history as an important independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, although there may be familial aggregation of subjects with a high susceptibility to the effects of the three primary risk factors, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Aims: Disulfiram {{is widely}} used to prevent {{alcoholic}} relapse. However, due to the intended adverse reaction with ethanol, some believe that its use is dangerous for patients with personality disorders or psychiatric comorbidities because of their increased risk of impulsivity or suicidal behaviour. We examined the safety and efficacy in relapse prevention {{of a series of}} alcoholics with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Methods: <b>Case</b> <b>history</b> <b>study</b> of patients diagnosed with BPD, prescribed disulfiram in a dose of 1. 5 – 2. 5 g/ week, supervised by a physician in up to three brief contacts per week. Results: Two out of eight patients remained completely ab-stinent during the supervised disulfiram therapy over a mean period of 9. 25 months. Adherence to treatment was 18. 44 ± 21. 78 months. The first relapse occurred after 1. 38 ± 1. 41 months. The cumulated time of abstinence was 16. 88 ± 20. 48 months. The overall toler-ability was considered to be high; dizziness and fatigue appeared in all patients {{at the beginning of the}} therapy but did not persist. No serious adverse events or ethanol–disulfiram interactions were observed. No suicidal behaviour was reported. Conclusions: Although case observations should be interpreted with caution, supervised disulfiram seems to deserve further investigation in patients with comorbid BPD, for whom it appears to help prevent alcoholic relapse...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a <b>case</b> <b>history</b> <b>study</b> on the geologic investigation and numerical modeling of a reactivated landslide in the County of Santa Clara, California {{to identify the}} failure mechanism. The landslide occurred on an approximately 18. 3 -m high, north-facing slope during March 2011. The landslide measured about 33. 5  m in width and about 51. 8  m in length. Along the toe of the slope, a residential structure with a swimming pool was built on a cut and fill pad {{and there are several}} other structures present along the western side of the pad. The landslide occurred immediately to the south of the residential building and moved northward between the County Road A and the house's side yard. The movement of the landslide resulted in damaging the west-bound traffic lane of County Road A and encroached onto the paved driveway for the residential property. An investigation was performed to identify the failure mechanism of the landslide to conclude whether Road A re-alignment by the County or prominent cutting performed along the lower portion of the slope by the homeowner during 2000 through 2004 contributed to the reactivation of the old landslide deposit. The investigation included site reconnaissance, reviewing available published geologic information, reviewing site-specific geologic and geotechnical data developed by other consultants, and performing numerical modeling. The outcomes of the investigation indicate that the primary causation for the reactivation and failure of the subject pre-existing landslide is the prominent cutting performed along the lower portion of the slope during 2000 through 2004 and water tank cut bench. The Road A re-alignment did not contribute to the reactivation of the old landslide deposit...|$|E

40|$|An {{association}} between malarial infections and nephropathies {{has been suggested}} for a long time.

The nephrotic syndrome of African children and adults was well characterized from the clinical and pathologic viewpoints, and its association with Plasmodium malariae also was documented quite well [2 – 8]. The etiology and pathogenesis of the renal lesions, however, was not understood perfectly, and the possibility that persons with the nephrotic condition have a lower resistance to P. malariae infection was not disproved completely [1, 8]. For these reasons, more detailed studies were undertaken to establish the factors responsible for the initiation and perpetuation of renal lesions, to provide additional evidence of their association with malarial infections and, especially, to investigate whether these lesions are compatible with an immune-complex pathogenesis as described in other diseases...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 33 Anti-friction {{bearings}} {{in process}} pumps, by design frequently utilize oil sump lubrication technology. For many years, {{it was an}} accepted condition that the lubricating oil used in oil sump bearing lubrication needed to be changed {{on a regular basis}} to prevent high levels of contamination that can lead to premature bearing failure, contributing to equipment downtime. Often, the indicators used to determine change intervals were based on visual elements of oil, such as color. As simple as this method is there are many critical elements that will degrade the overall performance of the lubricant, resulting in premature component failure. Understanding how these elements work together to provide reliable lubrication and, more importantly, increased equipment life and performance are explained.

40|$|Unexpected {{failure of}} subaqueous {{excavated}} slopes {{in the form}} of flow slides is considered in this graduate study. Excavated slopes {{are not the same as}} slopes constructed by means of hydraulic fill. Several recent flow slide failures in sand borrow pits, together with qualms in engineering practice about not knowing exactly what fundamental mechanism causes flow slide failure, gave cause for this study. The knowledge that flow slide failure may be caused by either static liquefaction of (part of) a sloping body (also called spontaneous collapse), or by the development of active banks, is taken as a point of departure. Liquefaction due to dynamic loading will be left out of consideration. Special attention will be paid to the geological circumstances of The Netherlands. Herewith, the central problem of this flow slide study becomes: "How, from an engineering point of view, can we understand and predict flow slide failure of excavated (or being excavated) slopes, better?". To be able to answer the question at issue, we need to understand the fundamental mechanisms, leading to flow slide failure. Then, the soil properties may be related to the mechanisms and specific circumstances may be taken into account. The main aim of this graduate study is to obtain insight in different mechanisms, possibly triggering flow slide failure and causing its retrogressive nature. Since the extent of a flow slide can be very large, and seems hard to predict, the prediction of the potential for failure will be the pith of the study, not the consequences of failure (Volume 1 : Literature Review). The possible ways to model failure potential are investigated and their prediction values are evaluated on the basis of case histories (Volume 3 : <b>Case</b> <b>History</b> <b>Study</b> / Appendix). With the insights obtained, an effort has been made to formulate a practical guideline for flow slide analyses, which should lead to improvements in engineering practice (this Volume 2 : Directive for Engineering Practice).

40|$|Objectives: Evaluation of {{improvement}} in communicative abilities {{in children with}} nonsyndromic cleft palate. Methods: Longitudinal retrospective <b>case</b> <b>history</b> <b>Study.</b> Out of 117 children with cleft lip and/or cleft palate born in 1998, 1999 and 2000 and enrolled in the cleft palate team of the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG), 63 children {{were included in the}} study; 29 (46 %) boys and 34 (54 %) girls. From these 63 Dutch speaking children communicative abilities were measured when toddlers and at early school age. Cleft types were cleft lip with or without cleft alveolus (CL +/- A; n = 10, 5 %), unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP; n = 23, 37 %), bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP: n = 9, 14 %) and isolated cleft palate (CP; n = 21, 33 %). The percentage of problems in language comprehension, language production, articulation, hearing and hypernasality, present when toddlers, were compared with the percentage of problems found at early school age. The treatments executed were also analysed. Results: Except for hearing problems, problems in all other communicative fields improved significantly. In the total group language comprehension problems decreased from 23 % to 2 % (p = 0. 00), language production problems from 21 % to 6 % (p = 0. 01), articulation problems from 57 % to 25 % (p = 0. 00) and hypernasality from 38 % to 10 % (p = 0. 04). Hearing problems appeared more difficult to treat effectively, they decreased from 42 % to 31 % (p = 0. 29). Children with BCLP appeared to have the most problems, followed by children with UCLP and then children with CP. Children with CL A show the least problems. In the intervening period, often a combination of treatments was performed. Pharyngoplasty appeared to be very successful in treating hypernasality, with a Success rate of 86 %. Conclusions: At early school age, in children with clefts, speech and language problems were significantly improved following a Multidisciplinary approach to treatment and resemble their peers without clefts. Hearing problems were more difficult to treat. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{coloured}} {{population in}} Britain tend {{to settle in}} her main ports and form distinct social groupings. Their origin and development are similar in most cases. The core of these settlements was established by coloured seamen and their population grew by gradual increases during normal periods and by large influxes of various categories of coloured men, resulting from two world wars. The groups also increased in size and were stabilized by miscegenation between the immigrants and white women or British born coloured women. Only during the last twenty-five years has interest been aroused in sociological studies of {{this section of the}} British population. Little's survey of the Cardiff Negro community is the first comprehensive study {{of its kind in the}} United Kingdom. Since then, studies have been made by Richmond, Silberman and Spice; and others are in progress. Little traced the historical development of colour prejudice in Britain from 1660 A. D. to the present time. He pointed out the social and cultural factors giving rise to these attitudes, and how they operate against coloured people resident in Britain to-day. Silberman and Spice made a study of the relationship between coloured and white children in six Liverpool schools by applying the 'Friendship and Rejection' psychological tests. From the results obtained, they concluded that prejudice is not generally experienced by mixed racial groups of children. Richmond was concerned with the adjustment and assimilation of West Indian workers into British society. He calls his investigation a <b>case</b> <b>history</b> <b>study</b> based mainly on records of individual case files and other reports and documents. A number of interviews were also made. He has shown how economic insecurity and 'stereotype' influence racial prejudice. His main thesis, however, is to show the correlation between the high degree of skill in the West Indian worker and his adjustment to British society. The relevance of these studies to the problem of social integration is obvious. As Little has shown, colour prejudice is one of the principal obstacles to the assimilation of coloured minorities into British society. His work is a major contribution to the field of race relations as it establishes a base from which other racial problems may be investigated. Richmond's research is concerned with one category of coloured people only, that is, selected West Indians who were skilled men. The data is of value to this this study for purposes of comparison with the adjustment of other categories and groups of coloured persons, such as workers who are unskilled or are of other ethnic groups. The findings of Silberman and Spice would have been more convincing had the data been more adequate. Nevertheless, the study sheds light on an important aspect of race relations. These studies, with the exception of the last mentioned, are concerned primarily with Negroes. The Moslem population had still to be examined...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{formulation}} {{and implementation of}} a finite element model, {{which is based on}} the so called Hybrid Stress Finite Element Method. The proposed formulation is based on stress as the primary unknown and is radically different from displacement-based finite element models.

Verification tests carried out on problems in elasticity with closed form solutions show that the proposed method is accurate and that it requires relatively fewer elements than displacement-based finite element method to achieve the same accuracy.
