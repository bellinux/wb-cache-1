5|$|Gambira started {{attending}} school at age five, but the 1988 pro-democracy protests caused school closings that interrupted Gambira's schooling. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), {{he ran away}} from home at age 12 and was recruited as a <b>child</b> <b>soldier</b> by a military unit in Yangon. Once his parents located him, they removed him from the unit and returned with him to their home in Pauk Township. When the authorities came to investigate, Gambira's parents enrolled him in a local monastery to protect him from arrest or conscription into further military service.|$|E
5|$|Apollo tells Veronica that he {{actually}} does want the paternity test. Dick’s father, {{who was involved in}} a corporate crime, appears and berates him for going on the surfing trip in the summer. Apollo takes the paternity test, but the father doesn’t appear. However, Apollo informs Veronica that {{he actually}} was a <b>child</b> <b>soldier,</b> enlisting his former roommate to tell her that he wasn’t so that he could ensure his father was genuinely loving. The only reason the father did not show up to the paternity test was that he was detained for having the wrong license plates. Apollo and the father meet at the Sheriff’s office, where they have an emotional reunion. Dick angrily confronts his father, but the next time he is seen, he calls off his trip with Logan. Logan tells Parker this news, and she is disappointed.|$|E

This paper discusses {{the problem of}} <b>child</b> <b>soldiering,</b> specifically the <b>child</b> <b>soldiering</b> occurring on the continent of Africa. It gives a detailed overview of all aspects of <b>child</b> <b>soldiering</b> and the conflicts involving <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> in African countries. This paper explores the push-pull factors that lead children to become <b>child</b> <b>soldiers.</b> It follows these <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> from life within the armed group to life upon leaving the armed group, where upon these children enter rehabilitation centers, and finally seek reintegration back into society. It also looks at the reasons {{for some of the}} conflicts involving <b>child</b> <b>soldiers,</b> pointing out how part of this crisis stems from colonialism. This paper also asks {{the question of how to}} stop this crisis, and examines what developed nations are doing to stop <b>child</b> <b>soldiering</b> while claiming that the ultimate responsibility for the issue lies within Africa...|$|R
40|$|The {{humanitarian}} discourse defines <b>children</b> and <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{along with}} women {{as the main}} victims of conflicts. They view <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> as helpless and deprived of their rights, but this view does not always add up with reality. The anthropological discourse describes <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> as a tactic actor who is capable of making logical choices in order to survive. The reality {{is more complex than}} the humanitarian discourse portrays. The purpose of this thesis is to examine how <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> are portrayed by the humanitarian discourse and how that in turn reproduces a certain picture of <b>child</b> <b>soldiers?</b> How does that portrayal fit into the anthropological discussion of <b>child</b> <b>soldiers?</b> I want to investigate how anthropological research can contribute with an understanding of how the portrayal of <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> affect the comprehension of <b>child</b> <b>soldiering.</b> To do this, several analytical tools will be developed based on Anthony Giddens theory of structure and agent and on a discourse analysis method. To answer the research questions, an analysis will be conducted on three humanitarian organisations and three anthropological studies. The organisations and the anthropological studies were chosen based on their involvement and relevance in the discussion and work with <b>child</b> <b>soldiers.</b> The result shows that the main difference between the humanitarian and the anthropological discourses is that the humanitarian discourse portrays <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> in a more constricted way. The anthropological discourse explains how <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> act according to their own agency and they act based on their existing structure...|$|R
40|$|There are an {{estimated}} 250, 000 child soldiers—boys and girls {{under the age of}} eighteen—who are being compelled to serve in more than fifteen conflicts worldwide. <b>Child</b> <b>soldiers</b> are forcibly recruited or abducted and are used as combatants, messengers, porters, cooks, and to provide sexual services. International law now recognizes <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> as victims of war crimes, deserving of state compassion. The U. S. Department of Homeland Security, however, has opposed asylum for <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> on the grounds that their military service subjects them to the “persecutor bar. ” Barring <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> from asylum protection penalizes them for having been the victims of a crime and undercuts all efforts to protect them. This Article argues that a per se bar of <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> from asylum contradicts the United States’ adherence to the international view that the use of <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> constitutes a violation of human rights, domestic laws declaring recruitment of <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> a crime, and active support of the eradication of the use of <b>child</b> <b>soldiers.</b> Instead, <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> should be able to argue that their conduct falls beyond the scope and intent of the persecutor bar. This Article concludes by offering an approach to determine when a child solider should be subjected to the persecutor bar that balances the seriousness of the <b>child</b> <b>soldier’s</b> actions against the circumstances under which he or she was recruited...|$|R
5|$|Logan tells Parker that he {{will not}} be seeing her in the summer because he will be on a surfing trip with Dick. Mac (Tina Majorino) and Max (Adam Rose) spend all their time together. Piz tells Veronica about another {{internship}} in Neptune, but she dodges his attempts to ask which one he should take. Keith meets Liam Fitzpatrick (Rod Rowland), who states that the robberies will not stop. Apollo learns that Veronica was not assigned by the school paper, and Veronica tells him the truth, but he refuses a paternity test. Some people begin to grow dissatisfied with Keith’s handling of the robberies, while Apollo’s father claimant appears in Neptune. Veronica searches for Apollo, learning from his former roommate that Apollo did not actually write the book, and he was never a <b>child</b> <b>soldier.</b> However, Wallace (Percy Daggs III) urges her not to expose him as a hoax, as his book as actually helping charities that aid child soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Piz {{hang out}} at her house. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) tests Veronica on her {{upcoming}} private investigator exam, and Piz states that he is interviewing a former <b>child</b> <b>soldier,</b> Apollo, and Hearst student for his radio show. Keith informs his deputies that a robbery wave has been occurring. Piz interviews the student before telling Veronica {{that he has been}} offered an internship by Pitchfork Media. Veronica receives a 95% on the PI exam before being called by a man stating that Apollo is his son. Keith speaks to a suspect in some of the robberies and discovers that he is connected to the Fitzpatricks. Logan meets Parker’s (Julie Gonzalo) parents, who are very uptight. Veronica speaks to Apollo, posing as a reporter for the school newspaper, finding that Apollo’s mother’s handwriting is very similar to the letter his father claimed to have from his mother.|$|E

Taking into consideration how <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> affect conflict and how important their reintegration is to sustainable peace and post-conflict development, we analyse whether the presence of <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> in a civil war increases the likelihood of the presence of a PKO. We argue that the UN deems a conflict with <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> as a difficult case for conflict resolution, necessitating a response from the international community. This is in line with our empirical results confirming that the use of <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> significantly increases the likelihood of peacekeeping...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Child</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{are often}} both victims and {{perpetrators}} of horrendous acts of violence. Research with former <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> has consistently shown {{that exposure to}} violence is linked to trauma-related disorders and that living in a violent environment is correlated with enhanced levels of aggression. Objective: To gain more insight into the experiences and the mental health status of former <b>child</b> <b>soldiers,</b> we conducted a survey with N 200 former <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> and adult combatants in the DR Congo. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews concerning military experiences, experienced and perpetrated violence, and mental health. Results: Former <b>child</b> <b>soldiers</b> reported more experienced and perpetrated violence, a greater severity of trauma-related suffering, as well as higher appetitive aggression than adult ex-combatants. Appetitive aggression was related to more perpetrated violence, higher military ranks, voluntary recruitment and higher rates of reenlistments in former <b>child</b> <b>soldiers.</b> Conclusions: Our results indicate that growing up in an armed group is related {{to higher levels of}} trauma-related disorders and aggressive behavior. This may explain the challenge of reintegrating former <b>child</b> <b>soldiers.</b> It is thus important to consider mental health problems, particularly trauma-related disorders an...|$|R
