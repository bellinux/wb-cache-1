In this study, we introduce a novel procedure for preparing a bifunctional activated carbon nanocomposite in which nanoscale-sized magnetic magnetite and antimicrobial silver nanoparticles are incorporated (MACAg). The antimicrobial efficacy of the nanocomposite was tested against Escherichia coli (E. coli). MACAg (0. 5 g, 0. 04 % Ag) was found to remove and kill 106 – 107 <b>CFU</b> (<b>colony-forming</b> <b>units)</b> in 30 min via a shaking test and the removing and killing rate of the nanocomposites increased with increasing silver content and decreased with increasing CFU. The inhibition zone tests revealed, among the relevant components, only Ag nanoparticles and Ag+ ions showed antimicrobial activities. The MACAg was easily recoverable from treated water due to its magnetic properties and was able to remove and kill 106 CFU after multiple-repeated use. The MACAg nanocomposite also demonstrated its feasibility and applicability for treating a surface water containing 105 CFU. Combining low cost due to easy synthesis, recoverability, and reusability with high antimicrobial efficiency, MACAg may provide a promising water disinfection technology that will find wide applications...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of three water point mapping (WPM) studies carried out in three rural districts of Tanzania covering 3, 363 water points. The methodology was designed to estimate the influence that consideration {{of the quality of}} the water supplied and the year-round functionality of each water point would have on each district's coverage figures. To this end, the study included measurements of basic quality parameters (692 analyses) and characterisation of the year-round continuity of service, in addition to the data collected in standard WPM campaigns. Both the quality and year-round continuity results were analysed in a disaggregated form by water point technology. The results show that 22 % of the improved water points analysed had more than 10 <b>CFU</b> (<b>colony-forming</b> <b>units)</b> / 100 ml of water and 19 % were seasonal. Moreover, water service coverage in the districts studied fell 40 % on average when quality and year-round continuity were considered. There is a strong need to include these basic factors in the minimum standards to be delivered and monitored in rural areas. Simple and efficient methodologies for including quality and year-round continuity measurements in the information routines, such as the one presented here, are a necessary step to this end.

However, {{the role of}} the PapG II adhesin in {{enhancing}} the establishment and persistence of E. coli infection in the kidney is controversial. A pyelonephritogenic strain, EC 114, which possesses one copy of the papG II gene, but without other virulence factors (such as S/F 1 C-fimbriae, hemolysin, and cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1) was selected {{for the construction of a}} papG II mutant. The resulting papG II mutant was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, Southern hybridization, and agglutination assay, and designated as MEC 114. We compared MEC 114 with the parental strain (EC 114) for colonization ability in the bladder and kidney of female BALB/c mice, which were challenged transurethrally with 50 μl of a low (5 × 104 <b>CFU</b> (<b>colony-forming</b> <b>unit))</b> or high (5 × 108 CFU) dose of EC 114 or MEC 114 and assessed 1, 3, and 7 days after inoculation.

On the seventh day, both strains were mainly cleared from the kidney. Renal biopsy showed a similar degree of inflammatory response to both strains 1, 3, and 7 days after inoculation. In brief, the PapG II adhesin can enhance the early establishment of E. coli infection in the kidney, but the bacteria do not maintain infection owing to the host immune response...|$|R
40|$|Cartilage lesion is {{a fairly}} common problem in {{orthopaedic}} practise. It is often a consequence of traumas, inflammatory conditions, and biomechanics alterations. However, as an avascular and aneural tissue, articular cartilage has minimal healing ability. Over the past decades, surgeons and scientists have proposed a nubmer of treatment strategies to promote restoration of articular cartilage, like arthroscopic lavage, microfracture surgery, osteochoncral autografts and allografts, autologous chondrocyte implantation, and other cell-based repairs. Nevertheless, these solutions often result in fibrocartilage, which has inferior mechanical and biochemical properties, with increased susceptibility to injury, which usually ultimately leads to osteoarthritis (OA). Stem cell therapy techniques are widely applied in treating disease or injury. Many medical researchers have proposed stem cell transplantation treatment for enhancing cartilage repair by using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) along with biocompatible scaffolds. In addition to that, chondrogenic progenitor cells (CPCs) have also been discovered in OA patients and healthy articular cartilage. However, neither the method for isolating CPCs is not well established, nor the origin and function is not fully understood. Stem cells may be measured in <b>CFUs</b> (<b>Colony-forming</b> <b>units).</b> Ideally, adult stem cells should be clonogenic.

A, salmonicida subsp, salmonicida was isolated from cod, halibut and wrasse, but only occasionally. The injection challenge studies with A, salmonicida subsp. salmonicida were carried out on cod and halibut. Despite challenge with 4. 6 x 10 (3), 4. 6 x 10 (4) and 4. 6 x 10 (5) <b>CFU</b> (<b>colony-forming</b> <b>units)</b> of the bacterium, only 1 halibut died, whereas no mortality occurred in the cod groups.

Nevertheless, the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) in oral oncological surgery is relatively high, especially in major surgery with reconstruction and tracheotomy. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the perioperative condition related to microorganisms in the oral cavity and to examine the efficacy of the topical administration of tetracycline in reducing the number of bacteria in the oropharyngeal fluid during intubation. The number of oral bacteria was measured during intubation in patients undergoing major oral cancer surgery. The efficacy of the topical administration of tetracycline or povidone iodine gel in reducing the bacteria was then investigated. Bacteria in the oropharyngeal fluid grew from 106 CFU/ml to 108 CFU/ml during the 3 h after intubation (<b>CFU,</b> <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units).</b> When tetracycline was applied to the dorsum of the tongue, oral bacteria decreased immediately to 105 CFU/ml, and the number of bacteria in the oropharyngeal fluid was maintained below 107 CFU/ml for 7 h. The concentration of tetracycline in the oropharyngeal fluid was extremely high for several hours after topical administration. The topical administration of tetracycline could reduce oral bacteria in patients undergoing clean-contaminated oral cancer surgery.

40|$|AbstractBrucella ovis is {{considered}} the most important infectious cause of reproductive disorders in sheep. The disease is characterized by epididymitis, subfertility and infertility in rams. B. ovis occasionally results in abortion in ewes, as well. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate kinetic changes in the reproductive organs of rams experimentally infected with B. ovis. Nine rams were experimentally inoculated intrapreputially with 2 mL of a suspension containing 1. 2 × 109 <b>CFU</b> (<b>colony-forming</b> <b>units)</b> /mL of B. ovis (strain ATCC 25840). In addition, 50 μL of a suspension containing 1. 2 × 1010 CFU/mL of the same B. ovis strain was inoculated into each conjunctival sac, resulting in 3. 6 × 109 CFU total per ram. Six of nine infected rams had developed clinical changes in the tail of the epididymis at 30 days post-infection (dpi), but these changes regressed in 50 % of these rams. Ultrasound demonstrated an increase in the area of the tail of the epididymis (P< 0. 001), reduction in the area of the testes (P< 0. 001), and an increased length and width of the seminal vesicles (P< 0. 001) during the course of infection. A sperm granuloma was diagnosed on the basis of ultrasonography findings. Microscopically, there was epididymitis, testicular degeneration, and seminal vesiculitis. Inflammatory cells were detected in the semen even before the development of epididymitis. Moreover, inflammatory cells were also found in the semen of asymptomatic rams, indicating that the presence of leukocytes in the ejaculate is a valuable method for screening potential carriers of infections in the genital tract...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{role of the}} inter-hospital non-living {{environment}} in spreading of some infections is not universally accepted attitude, but still there is a proof {{that in some cases}} it is a risk factor for causing infections with some pathogenic microorganisms. Isolation of microorganisms from the non-living environment can significantly vary in reproducibility and sensitivity of different methods of collecting specimen and its cultivation. Aim: In aim to develop and assess hygienic control strategies with incorporating better monitoring and improved cleaning, we have undertaken this survey in microbiological labs to offer better approach in infection control procedures for sampling specimens from inanimate {{environment in}} health care facilities. Material and Methods: Three issues might have influence on isolation rates of the mircroorganisms:sampling technique, cultivation methods and professional behaviour of the staff regarding the recommendations and guidelines for hygiene of the workplace. Staphylococcus aureus was almost the only isolated opportunistic microorganism from the surfaces of the workplaces (five from ten), beside Enterococcus, and there was no obvious differentiation in isolation capability between both used swabs. Semi-quantitative method was used for cultivation of saprophytic bacteria. Average of cfu from all used nutrient media was used to estimate bio-mass. Results: Mann-Whitney U test has confirmed statistically significant differentiation between average of <b>cfu</b> (<b>colony-forming</b> <b>unit)</b> (p = 0. 0215) sampled with Quanti swab in comparison with wet traditional cotton swab. Plating with swab on trypticase soy agar showed a statistically significant difference between the number of cfu after 24 h and 48 h (Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Test: Z = 2. 66; p = 0. 0076).

40|$|Salmonella Typhimurium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{dangerous}} foodborne pathogens and poses a significant threat to human health. The objective of this study was to develop a portable impedance immunosensing system for rapid and sensitive detection of S. Typhimurium in poultry. The developed portable impedance immunosensing system consisted of a gold interdigitated array microelectrode (IDAM), a signal acquisitive interface and a laptop computer with LabVIEW software. The IDAM was first functionalized with 16 -Mercaptohexadecanoic acid, and streptavidin was immobilized onto the electrode surface through covalent bonding. Then, biotin-labelled S. Typhimurium-antibody was immobilized onto the IDAM surface. Samples were dropped on the surface of the IDAM and the S. Typhimurium cells in the samples were captured by the antibody on the IDAM. This resulted in impedance changes that were measured and displayed with the LabVIEW software. An equivalent circuit of the immunosensor demonstrated that the largest change in impedance was due to the electron-transfer resistance. The equivalent circuit showed an increase of 35 % for the electron-transfer resistance value compared to the negative control. The calibration result indicated that the portable impedance immunosensing system could be used to measure the standard impedance elements, and it had a maximum error of measurement of approximately 13 %. For pure culture detection, the system had a linear relationship between the impedance change and the logarithmic value of S. Typhimurium cells ranging from 76 to 7. 6 × 106 <b>CFU</b> (<b>colony-forming</b> <b>unit)</b> (50 μL) − 1. The immunosensor also had a correlation coefficient of 0. 98, and a high specificity for detection of S. Typhimurium cells with a limit of detection (LOD) of 102 CFU (50 μL) − 1. The detection time from the moment a sample was introduced to the display of the results was 1 h. To conclude, the portable impedance immunosensing system for detection of S. Typhimurium achieved an LOD that is comparable with commercial electrochemical impedance instruments. The developed impedance immunosensor has advantages in portability, low cost, rapid detection and label-free features showing a great potential for in-field detection of foodborne pathogens...|$|R

The average total concentration of particles in the sand filter effluent during a filter cycle was 148 particles/mL, 27 of which were larger than 2 µm in size. The concentration in the GAC effluent (561 particles/mL) was significantly greater than that in the sand filter effluent. The concentration of particles larger than 2 µm in the GAC filter effluent reached 201 particles/mL, {{with the amount of}} particles with sizes between 2 µm and 15 µm increasing. The most probable number (MPN) of carbon fines reached 43 unit/L after six hours and fines between 0. 45 µm and 8. 0 µm accounted for more than 50 %. The total concentration of outflowing bacteria in the GAC filter effluent, 350 <b>CFU</b> (<b>colony-forming</b> <b>units)</b> /mL, was greater than that in the sand filter effluent, 210 CFU/mL. The desorbed bacteria concentration reached an average of 310 CFU/mg fines. The disinfection efficiency of desorbed bacteria was lower than 40 % with 1. 5 mg/L of chlorine. The disinfection effect showed that the inactivation rate with 2. 0 mg/L of chloramine (90 %) was higher than that with chlorine (70 %). Experimental results indicated that the high particle concentration in raw water and sedimentation effluent led to high levels of outflowing particles in the sand filter effluent. The activated carbon fines in the effluent accounted for a small proportion of the total particle amount, but the existing bacteria attached to carbon fines may influence the drinking water safety.

40|$|A {{collaborative}} {{evaluation of}} the MS- 2 urine screening system indicated that the automated method could successfully identify at least 84 % of urine specimens that contained {{greater than or equal}} to 10 (5) <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units</b> per ml. Most specimens not detected as positive by the system contained primarily diphtheroids and yeasts. Excluding those specimens which contained diphtheroids and yeasts, the MS- 2 system correctly identified as positive 94. 8 % of specimens that contained {{greater than or equal to}} 10 (5) <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units</b> per ml and as negative 96. 1 % of specimens that contained less than 10 (4) <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units</b> per ml.

40|$|Cystatin (CST) 11, a novel {{member of}} the CST type 2 family of {{cysteine}} protease inhibitors, was identified in Macaca mulatta epididymis by subtractive hybridization cloning. The human CST 11 gene on chromosome 20 p 11. 2 is located near three other CST genes expressed predominantly in the male reproductive tract. The CST 11 gene spans three exons, a structure {{similar to that of}} other CST family 2 genes. An exon 2 -deleted alternative transcript (CST 11 � 2) was also identified. CST 11 mRNA is expressed only in the epididymis as judged by Northern blot hybridization and is androgen regulated. The protein is most abundant in the initial segment, Abbreviations: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; <b>CFU,</b> <b>colony-forming</b> unit; CST, cystatin; EST, expressed sequence tag; h, human; LCN, lipocalin; NF-�B, nuclear factor �B; PEA, polyomavirus enhancer activator 3; TEV, tobacco etch virus. but is detected throughout the epididymis and on ejaculated human sperm. The calculated tertiary structure of CST 11 reveals that the three regions corresponding to the protease inhibitory wedge of CST 3 are similarly juxtaposed in CST 11, consistent with protease inhibitor function. Intact and exon 2 -deleted CST 11 recombinant proteins were tested for antibacterial activity. After a 2 -h incubation of Escherichia coli with 50 �g/ml recombinant CST 11 or CST 11 � 2, bacterial <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units</b> were reduced to 30 % of control, indicating that both forms have antimicrobial activity.

40|$|Charcoal-yeast extract agar {{is a new}} {{bacteriological}} {{medium that}} supports excellent growth of the Legionella pneumophila. It results from modifications made in an existing L. pneumophila medium, F-G agar. Yeast extract, instead of an acid hydrolysate of casein, serves as the protein source. Beef extractives and starch are not added. Activated charcoal (Norit A or Norit SG) is included at 0. 20 % (wt/vol). Comparison of charcoal-yeast extract and F-G agars showed that {{a greater number of}} <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units</b> of L. pneumophila was recovered from a standardized tissue inoculum on charcoal-yeast extract agar (4. 35 x 10 (6) <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units)</b> than on F-G agar (4. 85 x 10 (4) <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units).</b> Macroscopic colonies of L. pneumophila were visible on the new medium within 3 days, whereas 4 days of growth was required on F-G agar...|$|R

40|$|Systemic and {{gastrointestinal}} infection can {{be established}} in infant mice after intragastric challenge with Candida albicans. Differences in virulence of the six strains tested were noted. As early as 3 h after infection, some but not all livers, spleens, and kidneys contained C. albicans, but the peak number of <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units</b> in these organs was seen at 6 h. The early colonization of the organs could not be attributed to aspiration of the inoculum since about 90 % of lungs and livers tested yielded no <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units</b> at 10 to 15 min postinfection. In animals with systemic infections, lungs, livers, kidneys, and spleens showed similar numbers of <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units</b> within the organs during the first 6 h postinfection- and then the number declined progressively up to 72 h. The gastrointestinal tract was colonized throughout a 20 -day period of study. Counts made at intervals beyond day 1 yielded between 10 (5) and 10 (6) <b>colony-forming</b> <b>units</b> in the stomach, ileum, and cecum.
