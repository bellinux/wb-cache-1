2500|$|Stuyt {{was born}} {{as the son}} of a <b>cattle</b> <b>farmer.</b> Due to the {{headmaster}} of his school, he was employed in 1883 at the office of Adrianus Bleijs (1842-1912), whose neo-Romanesque style would become of great influence on Stuyt. In 1891 Stuyt joined the Cuypers office in Amsterdam, where he became an overseer of the building of the Cathedral of Saint Bavo in Haarlem between 1895 and 1898. In 1899, after a short career as an independent architect in which he built his first church, he formed a partnership with Joseph Cuypers, son of Pierre Cuypers, which lasted until 1908. It seems that the architects in this period mostly worked on their own. Jan Stuyt mostly designed neo-Romanesque churches, often decorated with chessboard-like tile-decorations, which are present in many of the churches both during and after the partnership. [...] Cuypers chose a more neo-Gothic approach, closely related to the work of his father.|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} the {{research}} is “Possibility of introducing smallholder Beef <b>Cattle</b> <b>Farmers</b> Association {{as a starting point}} to develop the beef chain and improve their income in Arua district, Uganda”. The study was carried out in two Sub Counties of Arua district, Uganda. The objective was to investigate the possibility of forming beef <b>cattle</b> <b>farmers</b> association for smallholders to improve their bargaining position and the beef supply chain. The research examined the current status of the beef chain and the interventions for establishing smallholder farmers association. Survey questionnaires were administered to sixty smallholder beef <b>cattle</b> <b>farmers</b> in two Sub Counties (30 farmers per Sub County). Ten beef cattle traders and the district cooperative officer were interviewed to get additional information for the research. The results revealed that about seventy percent of the beef <b>cattle</b> <b>farmers</b> in Pajulu Sub County and about seventy seven percent from Rigbo Sub County support the idea of forming smallholder beef <b>cattle</b> <b>farmers</b> association. Seven beef cattle traders supported the idea of introducing the smallholder farmers association. The structure of beef chain showed that there are two channels from the farmers to the Urban and rural consumers. It can be concluded that the idea of introducing smallholder farmers association is supported by the majority of the smallholder beef <b>cattle</b> <b>farmers</b> and traders in Arua district. The farmers expect the association once formed to improve their access to inputs/financial credits, extension services. The association would help them (farmers) share experience and information on issues related to beef cattle enterprise on price, quality and quantity of the cattle needed by the potential buyers. The Cattle traders’ expectation from the association was to meet the required number of beef cattle in terms of volume hence reducing their transaction costs There should be a deliberate effort by Arua district local government to help smallholder farmers organise themselves and create awareness on the process of forming smallholder farmers association...|$|R
