For this the maximum demand and diversity is taken into consideration based on which the probable current is calculated.

From this the maximum demand is calculated and the currents are added to determine the load current and hence the rating of the circuit breaker.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the study of}} the behaviour of a real MV public distribution network in a mid-size in Italy, characterized by a very large amount of distributed generation (DG), reaching 100 % of supplied network load. A parametric steady-state analysis of operating regimes was carried out, considering different load and DG scenarios (maximum and minimum load, maximum and minimum DG). The deterministic study did not evidence any operational problem, such as overloads and violation of voltage constraints. Occasional voltage violations (high MV voltages at full DG output) are easily overcome by tap-changer operation on the HV/MV transformers. Although feeder voltage profiles are actually improved by DG, a drastic power factor reduction is found at the utility supply points, as well as the possible active power flow inversion, entailing contractual and regulatory issues. Extensive short-circuit studies were also carried out, showing that DG fault contribution in the studied network is far from negligible, but does not dictate changes of either <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>rating</b> or overcurrent relaying coordination...|$|E

40|$|Auto-expansion <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> {{utilize the}} arc’s energy to {{generate}} the flow conditions required for current interruption. The operation {{of this type of}} <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> is extremely complex and its interruption capability depends on the whole arcing history {{as well as a number}} of geometric factors. On the other hand, <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> development based on test is extremely expensive and time consuming. The accumulated understanding of the underlying physical processes so far enables arc models be used as a tool for optimum design of switchgear product such as high voltage <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers.</b> For academic research, there is often a need to study the performance of a newly developed arc model by inspecting the distribution of relevant physical quantities during a simulation and their sensitivity to model parameters in an efficient and convenient approach. However the effective use of computer simulation by design engineers has been hindered by the complexity encountered in model implementation. This thesis presents the development and structure of an automated simulation tool, the Integrated Simulation and Evaluation Environment (ISEE), for the arcing process in gas-blast <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers.</b> The functionalities of ISEE are identified and developed based on the experience in real product design, which include visual creation and definition of components, automatic setup of arc models based on a commercial CFD software package as equation solver, simulation task management, and visualization of computational results in “real-time” mode. This is the first automated simulation platform in the community of switching arc simulation. Using ISEE as the simulation tool, different designs of auto-expansion <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> have been investigated to reveal the fundamental characteristics of the arcing process under different test duties. Before attempting to investigate the capability of an auto-expansion <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker,</b> the fundamental issue of determining the turbulence parameter of the Prandtl mixing length model is addressed. Previous studies on turbulence arcs were mostly concerned with simple converging-diverging nozzles. There has been little work on real <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> nozzles. In order to calibrate the turbulence parameter, real arcing conditions including interrupting currents, contact travels, and transient recovery voltages of two commercial <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers,</b> with <b>rated</b> voltage of 145 kV and 245 kV, have been used together with the geometry of the <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> to calibrate the range of the turbulence parameter. The effect of nozzle ablation has been considered. All together 6 cases have been used for three <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> with each pair of cases corresponding to a success and failure in its thermal recovery process. It has been found that a single parameter of 0. 35 is applicable to all three <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> with an auxiliary nozzle and a main nozzle of converge-flat throat-diverge shape. It must be noted that this value is obtained with the definition of thermal radius introduced in Chapter 3 and the assumption that the parameter linearly changes with the interrupting current from 0. 05 at 15 kA to 0. 35 at current zero. Using the calibrated turbulence model, a computational study of the thermal interruption performance of a 145 kV, 60 Hz auto-expansion <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> with different arc durations has been carried out in Chapter 4. The relation between pressure peak and current peak in the auto-expansion <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> is discussed. It has been found that a larger average mass flux in the main nozzle indicates a better interruption environment, enabling the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> to withstand a larger rate of rise of recovery voltage after current zero. Another important finding is that the auxiliary nozzle plays an important role in an auto-expansion <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> both at the high current phase and during the current zero period. Therefore, the proper design and use of an auxiliary nozzle is a key factor to enhance the thermal interruption capability of high voltage auto-expansion <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers.</b> In Chapter 5 of the thesis, the transient pressure variation in auto-expansion <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> was studied. The pressure variation has an extremely complex pattern and the pressure changes in different ways depending on the location in the arcing chamber. It is shown, for the first time, that the time lag between the current peak and pressure peak in the expansion volume can be explained by using an energy flow rate balance method, that is flow reversal occurs when the enthalpy exhaustion rate from the contact space equals the electrical power input. Following the flow reversal, a high enthalpy flow rate from the expansion volume into the contact gap first occurs for a short while (1 ms), which is followed by a high mass flow rate of relatively cool gas at less than 2000 K. This high mass flow rate causes a surplus in mass flow rate into the contact gap and results in the last temporary pressure peak in the contact space before the pressure and flow field finally settle down for arc quenching at current zero. The pressure change under different conditions, i. e. different arc durations, different current levels and different length of the heating channel, has also been studied in details. In summary the present research leads to original findings in three aspects of the operation of auto-expansion <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers,</b> i. e. the calibration of the turbulence parameter for the Prandtl mixing length model, interruption performance with different arc durations, and the transient pressure variation in the arcing process. The results are expected to provide useful information for the optimum design of auto-expansion <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers...</b>|$|R
