Their {{dwellings}} were {{restricted to}} immediate family members, and were constructed of mud-brick designed to remain <b>cool</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heat of the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread. Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised {{from the floor and}} individual tables comprised the furniture.|$|E
5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{period of}} rapid deepening began early on September30 as a well-defined eye became clearly visible on satellite imagery. Ophelia intensified into a Category2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (155km/h) by 0600UTC {{and became the}} season's third major hurricane—a Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale—twelve hours later. Cloud tops continued to <b>cool</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system's eyewall late on October1, with cloud tops {{in the eye of}} the system warming. Ophelia intensified into a Category4 hurricane at 0000UTC on October2 and simultaneously attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 940mb (hPa; 27.76inHg) as it passed east of Bermuda. Weakening ensued the following day as the hurricane entered cooler sea surface temperatures and an environment characterized by significantly more stable air. Ophelia weakened below major hurricane intensity by 1800UTC and became a tropical storm for the final time by 0600UTC on October3. The system lost its tropical characteristics and was subsequently declared an extratropical cyclone four hours later while positioned just southwest of Newfoundland. The extratropical low was absorbed by a larger weather system by the afternoon hours of the following day.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Argentina {{is a complex}} subject: the vast size {{of the country and}} {{considerable}} variation in altitude make {{for a wide range of}} climate types. Argentina has four seasons: winter (June–August), spring (September–November), summer (December–February) and autumn (March–May), all featuring different weather conditions. Summers are the warmest and wettest season in most of the country except in most of Patagonia where it is the driest season. Winters are normally mild in the north, <b>cool</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center and cold in the southern parts with the latter experiencing frequent frost and snow. Because southern parts of the country are moderated by the surrounding oceans, the cold is less intense and prolonged than areas at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. Spring and autumn are transition seasons that generally feature mild weather.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} of inclusions and components states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or clasts) {{are found in}} a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. For example, in sedimentary rocks, {{it is common for}} gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found. These foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to <b>cool</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> matrix. As a result, xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them.|$|E

These spring-operated balancing mechanisms also typically permit the top of the windows to swing inward, permitting cleaning of the exterior of the IG window from inside the building.|$|E

25|$|His {{retirement}} {{at the end}} of {{that year}} did not mark the close of Geary's involvement with cricket. For over twenty years after that he was cricket coach at Charterhouse and in that time was seen as one of the best coaches any school has ever had. Most notably, the brilliant batsman Peter May admitted that Geary's coaching played a vital role in his development. After he left Charterhouse in 1959, Geary went to Rugby School, who were desperate for assistance to develop young players and improved their fortunes. Geary, as always, served them whole-heartedly, and he bowled, without the sweater to keep him <b>cool,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nets until he was about seventy-seven, a testimony to his amazing endurance despite many injuries and other setbacks. He died after gradually failing health in 1981 at the age of eighty-seven.|$|E
25|$|The Coptic Church {{broke from}} the other Eastern Orthodox Churches in 451 AD. After that date, the Copts, then a great {{majority}} of the Egyptian population, were shunned and often persecuted by their Byzantine rulers until the conquest of Egypt by Islam, after which the slowly declining Coptic population was in a rather precarious position. Coptic architecture therefore lacked the lavish patronage of rulers and the Court, which was directly responsible for most of the important buildings of Byzantine and medieval Catholic architecture. Most buildings are small, conservative in design, and remain closer to vernacular styles. They also have a tendency to massive construction, which is partly a surviving Egyptian taste from the Pharaonic period, partly reflects the need to semi-fortify buildings, partly is an inevitable result of mudbrick construction of large structures, and is also partly to keep them <b>cool</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian climate.|$|E

In the latitudinal direction the taiga is divided into three subzones - northern, middle and southern taiga. In the western taiga dense spruce and fir forests on wetlands alternate with pine forests, shrubs and meadows on the lighter soils. Such vegetation is typical of the eastern taiga, but it plays an important role not fir and larch. Coniferous forest, however, does not form a continuous array and sparse areas of birch, alder, willow (mainly in river valleys), the wetlands - marshes. Within the taiga are widespread fur-bearing animals - sable, marten, ermine, moose, brown bear, wolverine, wolf, and muskrat.|$|E
