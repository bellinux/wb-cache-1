5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E
5|$|As {{it became}} <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{was to be}} no {{reversal}} of Spanish American independence, several of the new states began to receive international recognition. Early, in 1822, the United States recognized Chile, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, Peru, Gran Colombia, and Mexico. Britain waited until 1825, after the Battle of Ayacucho, to recognize Mexico, Gran Colombia, and Río de la Plata. Both nations recognized more Spanish American states {{in the next few}} years.|$|E

It had already become <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were certain species that were ubiquitous in the region: some species of crabs, sea anemones, limpets, barnacles and sea cucumbers were found at every stop, and the sun star, Heliaster kubiniji, the sea urchin, Arbacia incisa, and bristleworms of the Eurythoe genus were common.|$|E

5|$|The {{remoteness}} of Dawson {{proved an}} ongoing {{problem for the}} supply of food, and as the population grew to 5,000 in 1897, this became critical. When the rivers iced over, it became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{would not be enough}} food for that winter. The NWMP evacuated some prospectors without supplies to Fort Yukon in Alaska from September 30 onwards, while others made {{their way out of the}} Klondike in search of food and shelter for the winter.|$|E
5|$|When the Second World War {{broke out}} the orchestra's plans {{had to be}} almost {{completely}} changed. During the First World War the public's appetite for concert-going diminished drastically, but {{from the start of}} the Second it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a huge demand for live music. The LSO arranged a series of concerts conducted by Wood, with whom the orchestra was completely reconciled. When the BBC evacuated its orchestra from London and abandoned the Proms, the LSO took over for Wood. The Carnegie Trust, with the support of the British government, contracted the LSO to tour Britain, taking live music to towns where symphony concerts were hitherto unknown.|$|E
5|$|A Confession of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record {{of the actions of}} the Assembly during the writing of the Confession, it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were {{significant}} debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.|$|E

It is not just Quatermass who is {{interested}} in what happened to Carroon and his crewmates; journalists such as James Fullalove (Paul Whitsun-Jones) and Scotland Yard's Inspector Lomax (Ian Colin) are also keen to hear his story. Carroon is abducted {{by a group of}} foreign agents whose government wants the information they believe he has obtained about travelling in space.

5|$|Skanderbeg's {{primary reason}} for allying with Alfonso was his fear of 21-year-old Mehmed II, whose {{ambition}} was to reconquer Justinian I's empire which stretched from Syria to Spain. Mehmed had been planning a campaign against Albania since Skanderbeg had defeated his father at Krujë in 1450. Another factor was that Krujë geographically dominated Durazzo, which was only 150 kilometers from Brindisi, the nearest Italian port. Mehmed's ambitions were symmetrical to Alfonso's and it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would {{be some sort of}} clash between the two in Albania, the epicenter of the conflict. Mehmed {{was one of the first}} monarchs since Roman times to keep a massive centralized army under his personal control. Besides controlling a huge army, Mehmed was widely acknowledged for his far-reaching wisdom which allowed him to produce a highly advanced military armed with the newest models of the cannon.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1812, Russia and the Ottoman Empire {{signed the}} Treaty of Bucharest, {{bringing}} the Russo-Ottoman War to a close. For his efforts, Karađorđe received the Order of Saint Anna from the Russians. The Governing Council scrambled {{to take an}} oath of loyalty to Russia in the hope that this would garner them further protection, to no avail. The Russian Emperor, Alexander, was aware of Napoleon's plans to invade Russia and desperately sought to return as many Russian soldiers as possible in order to repel the attack. As part of the Treaty of Bucharest, the Russians and Ottomans agreed that Serbian fortifications built after 1804 were to be destroyed, while cities and forts from which the Ottomans had been expelled {{over the course of the}} uprising were to be reoccupied and garrisoned by Ottoman troops. In exchange, the Ottomans agreed to declare a general amnesty for former rebels, as well as to grant the Serbs of the Pashalik of Belgrade some degree of autonomy. As part of the agreement, the Russians agreed to withdraw their forces from Serbia, as well as from Wallachia and Moldavia. The Russians encouraged Karađorđe and his followers to negotiate directly with the Porte regarding the minutiae of the handover of cities and fortifications to the Ottomans. Trepidation filled the rebel camp once it became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was nothing to prevent the Ottomans from exacting reprisals against the Pashalik's Serb population after the Russians withdrew. Karađorđe thus refused to abide by the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest and fighting continued.|$|E

30|$|The {{comparison}} of nano and microparticles {{in terms of}} heat transfer rate enhancement is shown in Fig.  6 b. Accordingly, the enhancement in the heat transfer rate due to microparticles dispersion is relatively {{higher than that of}} nanoparticles dispersion and this is true for any value of particle fraction. Moreover, microparticle composites maintain higher heat transfer rates at all times throughout solidification. This <b>clears</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no difference between microparticles and nanoparticle systems from qualitative perspective, although the enhancement by the former is quantitatively higher than that by the latter.|$|R

Consequently, it is <b>cleared</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is the optimum angle for each season, and the reflection against snow is very effective for the PV power generation. The angle usually depends on the latitude of location, but taking account of this effect, suitable installation angle changes. It implies that the optimum angle of all year round has flexibility. Actually, we can get about the same electric power when the angle is between 30 and 60 degrees...|$|R
