5|$|The {{last major}} eruptions of Lassen Peak {{occurred}} in April through June 1917, {{when a new}} crater was <b>created</b> <b>at</b> {{the summit of the}} mountain.

5|$|The six-episode {{series was}} {{released}} in Japan from April 2000 to March 2001. A manga and novel were also <b>created</b> <b>at</b> the time. It aired in the United States on Adult Swim in 2003 several times. It aired once again on the network's Toonami block from October 26, 2013 to January 25, 2014. The series is also available via Hulu, iTunes, and on Funimation's website.|$|E
50|$|Tutte's theorem {{characterizes the}} graphs with perfect {{matchings}} {{as being the}} ones for which deleting any subset U of vertices <b>creates</b> <b>at</b> most |U| odd components. (A subset U that <b>creates</b> <b>at</b> least |U| odd components can always {{be found in the}} empty set.) In this case, by the Tutte-Berge formula, the size of the matching is |V|/2; that is, the maximum matching is a perfect matching. Thus, Tutte's theorem can be derived as a corollary of the Tutte-Berge formula, and the formula {{can be seen as a}} generalization of Tutte's theorem.|$|R

5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was <b>created</b> <b>at</b> {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method of land management, but the controlled flooding of the meadows, with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing for sheep and cattle. Demonstrations of the techniques used to flood the meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{officers}} in Ordinary of the College were first instituted at different dates (some even before the incorporation of the College), some originating as private servants of noblemen, some being Royal from the start. They take their names and badges from the titles and royal badges of the monarchs of England. The officers Extraordinary, however take their names from the titles and estates of the Earl Marshal, they were also <b>created</b> <b>at</b> different dates for ceremonial purposes.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{sites were}} {{considered}} as temporary holding locations during renovations. In 2005, officials investigated establishing a new temporary site be <b>created</b> <b>at</b> the old Lake Success location. Brooklyn was also suggested {{as a temporary}} site. Another alternative for a temporary headquarters or a new permanent facility was the World Trade Center site. Once again, these plans met resistance both within the UN and from the United States and New York governments and were abandoned.|$|E

5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} sand is <b>created.</b> <b>At</b> high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, {{a process known as}} saltation. The whirling airborne grains act as a sand blasting mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the kinetic energy of the wind is transferred to the ground. The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} its lifetime, a {{star with}} more than about 20 solar masses can undergo {{gravitational}} collapse to form a black hole. According to classical physics, these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything, even electromagnetic radiation, from escaping past the Schwarzschild radius. However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking radiation at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be <b>created</b> <b>at</b> the event horizon of these stellar remnants.|$|E
5|$|By July 1944, Oppenheimer had {{concluded}} plutonium {{could not be}} used in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion. Two new groups were <b>created</b> <b>at</b> Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by explosives expert George Kistiakowsky and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher. The new design that von Neumann and T (for theoretical) Division, most notably Rudolf Peierls, had devised used explosive lenses to focus the explosion onto a spherical shape using a combination of both slow and fast high explosives.|$|E

40|$|Key words: Liner system. Tensile force. Slope angle. FEM {{analysis}} Abstract. As {{there is}} a few area or topographic factors for landfill site, the slope angle becomes steeper because it makes much disposal capacity.
