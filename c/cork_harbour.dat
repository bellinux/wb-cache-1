5|$|Plans for the salvage {{operation}} {{were approved}} by the Irish Coast Guard, and the salvage operation began on 1 September, with work to remove loose ropes and secure the fuel containers; the salvage operation was expected to take up to 3 weeks. Astrid was recovered by the sheerleg GPS Atlas on 9 September 2013 by Atlantic Towage and Marine, and was transported on a barge to Kinsale for assessment and an investigation of what caused the accident. The insurers of the ship deemed the cost of restoring Astrid to be too high due to the damage caused while she was partially submerged (an economic write-off); as such she was scrapped and taken to <b>Cork</b> <b>Harbour</b> to be broken up. The scrapping process was completed by April 2014.|$|E
25|$|In 1938 the United Kingdom {{handed over}} the three treaty ports (<b>Cork</b> <b>Harbour,</b> Bere Haven and Lough Swilly). Consequently, the Royal Navy withdrew from <b>Cork</b> <b>Harbour</b> in July 1938. Fort Rannoch {{was added to the}} Irish fleet at that time.|$|E

50|$|Based from Belfast, Mitchell {{moved to}} Cobh (then called Queenstown) in 1851 to {{supervise}} the foundation works for a lighthouse on the Spit Bank. Located in a relative shallow between Spike Island and Cove Fort, the lighthouse replaced an unlit buoy which marked a turn required by shipping to follow <b>Cork</b> <b>Harbour's</b> main navigable channel. Despite his blindness, with assistance from his son and grandson, Mitchell reportedly supervised {{some of the work}} directly. Contemporary accounts record how he was personally involved in construction of a number of his structures, transiting to the work sites in small boats, crawling on planks and examining joints by touch. While living in the area, he also befriended logician George Boole - who was based at Cork's university.|$|R

During the 19th century Fenian uprising, the famous Captain Mackey briefly captured and held the Monning Martello tower near Fota Island in Cork Harbour; this tower {{is believed to have been}} the only Martello tower ever captured, other than the original. The other <b>Cork</b> <b>Harbour</b> towers are at Ringaskiddy, Haulbowline Island (now part of the Irish Naval Service HQ) and at Belvelly and Rossleague on the Great Island (near Cobh). There are also Martello towers at Little Island and Rostellan, though these are no longer intact.|$|E

40|$|Of {{the three}} {{periwinkles}} Littorina littorea, Littorina saxatilis and Littorina littoralis only L. littorea, is of commercial value. The other two species are used mainly for decorative purposes {{and not for}} human consumption. Periwinkles are found on rocky shores and also on muddy intertidal zones which have a good cover of seaweed. They {{spend most of their}} existence in the intertidal zone below high water of neap tide and are found associated with the brown sea weeds such as bladderwrack (Ascophalium nodosum) and also the green sea weeds (Enteromorpha spp.). These weeds provide them with both shelter and food. Periwinkles browse on the sedentary animals which live on sea weed and on the weed itself. The investigations were confined to the size and quality of the periwinkles from Wexford, Waterford, Dungarvan, Youghal and <b>Cork</b> <b>Harbours.</b> The numbers per kilogram and the percentage meat yield were determined together with length frequency distribution...|$|R

Four vehicles were destroyed and many others damaged; three cavalry horses were killed {{but there were no}} other injuries. Major Pringle felt that the locomotive crew had not been sufficiently vigilant in keeping a proper lookout. Furthermore, he censured the Great Southern and Western Railway, the GNR(I) and the BNCR, over whose metals the train had run, for treating it as goods or cattle and marshalling the passenger vehicles behind the non-braked cattle wagons with the result that the vacuum brake was not in operation throughout the train.|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} a recruit index for the herring stock in the Celtic Sea and Division VIIj has long been recognised. In order to develop a survey for {{recruits}} and pre-recruits, good information {{on the distribution of}} these fish is required. This study is based on a pair trawl survey, conducted in February 2008. The area covered was from central-east Irish coast (Dundalk Bay) to central west Irish coast (Galway Bay), with special attention paid to the bays and inlets of the south and southwest coast. The overall aim was to map out the distribution of 0 - and 1 -ring herring so that decisions could be made on the design of a future survey for young fish. The catch was quantified and sorted according to species. Herring were sampled for length, weight, sex, maturity and age. Young herring appeared as a light dust on the 38 kHz frequency. The east coast of Ireland, from Dundalk Bay to Howth was identified as an important nursery area, though {{it was not possible to}} ascertain what proportion of these juveniles were of Celtic Sea origin. Within the Celtic Sea the main nursery grounds identified were Dungarvan Bay, <b>Cork</b> and Kinsale <b>Harbours.</b> All the bays surveyed in VIIj contained juvenile herring. Overall this survey was a success. It provided updated information on the occurrence of young herring along the coast. Along with information from fishermen, and literature sources it allows for the development of recruit surveys for herring of this stock. Further work remains to be done on discriminating the juveniles by season of spawning. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|R
25|$|The British built {{about fifty}} Martello towers around the Irish coastline, {{especially}} {{along the east}} coast, from Millmount (Drogheda), to Bray, around Dublin Bay but also around <b>Cork</b> <b>Harbour</b> on the south coast.

At the time of launch the vessel was fitted with all modern appliances, including accommodation for 40 first-class passengers and room to carry cattle on the main deck and lower decks. In October 1892, while on a voyage from Glasgow to Cork with about 250 tons of goods, the ship developed a heavy list after meeting heavy storms and arrived in <b>Cork</b> <b>harbour</b> nearly keeling over.|$|E
25|$|Promotion to {{lieutenant}} colonel came in 1861, and in 1864 and 1865, {{he was sent}} to Canada to review its fortifications and at the conclusion of his inspection he submitted what became a politically controversial report that stated that the Great Lakes and Upper Canada were not defensible. He then lectured about iron fortifications, and inspected and provided advice regarding the defences of various British colonies including Gibraltar and the Andaman Islands. He was promoted to colonel in 1867. In 1871 {{he was sent to}} India; and then worked on the defences of <b>Cork</b> <b>harbour,</b> which were completed in 1874.|$|E
25|$|Planning began for Operation Green in May 1940, and the British had {{intelligence}} about it beginning in around June of that year. The British {{were interested in}} securing Ireland as its capture by German forces would expose their western flank, and provide a base {{of operations for the}} Luftwaffe in the Battle of the Atlantic and in any operations launched to conquer Britain as part of Operation Sea Lion. The British suspected that the Germans target for an invasion attempt would be Cork, particularly <b>Cork</b> <b>Harbour</b> with the naval base at Cobh because it was the nearest to Luftwaffe bases in north west France.|$|E

The invasion plans did not go ahead and plans switched to invading Cape Verde island also belonging to neutral Portugal. These invasion plans also did not go ahead. Montgomery was then ordered to prepare plans for the invasion of neutral Ireland and to seize Cork, Cobh and <b>Cork</b> <b>harbour.</b> These invasion plans, {{like those of the}} Portuguese islands, also did not go ahead and in July 1940, Montgomery was appointed acting lieutenant-general, and placed in command of V Corps, responsible for the defence of Hampshire and Dorset, and started a long-running feud with the new Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of Southern Command, Lieutenant General Claude Auchinleck.|$|E
25|$|At 11:30a.m. on Thursday 11 April, Titanic {{arrived at}} <b>Cork</b> <b>Harbour</b> {{on the south}} coast of Ireland. It was a partly cloudy but {{relatively}} warm day, with a brisk wind. Again, the dock facilities were not suitable for a ship of Titanics size, and tenders were used to bring passengers aboard. In all, 123 passengers boarded Titanic at Queenstown, 3 First Class, 7 Second Class and 113 Third Class. In addition to the 24 cross-channel passengers who had disembarked at Cherbourg, another seven passengers had booked an overnight passage from Southampton to Queenstown. Among the seven was Father Francis Browne, a Jesuit trainee, who was a keen photographer and took many photographs aboard Titanic, including the last-ever known photograph of the ship. A decidedly unofficial departure {{was that of a}} crew member, stoker John Coffey, a Queenstown native who sneaked off the ship by hiding under mail bags being transported to shore. Titanic weighed anchor for the last time at 1:30p.m. and departed on her westward journey across the Atlantic.|$|E

500|$|These coastal defences {{marked a}} {{shift away from}} castles, which were both {{military}} fortifications and domestic buildings, towards forts, which were garrisoned but not domestic; often the 1540s are chosen as a transition date {{for the study of}} castles as a consequence. [...] The subsequent years also marked almost the end of indigenous English fortification design – by the 1580s English castle improvements were almost entirely dominated by imported European experts. The superiority of Scottish castle design also diminished; the Half Moon battery built at Edinburgh Castle in 1574, for example, was already badly dated in continental terms {{by the time it was}} built. The limited number of modern fortifications built in Ireland, such as those with the first gunports retrofitted to Carrickfergus Castle in the 1560s and at Corkbeg in <b>Cork</b> <b>Harbour</b> and built in the 1570s in fear of an invasion, were equally unexceptional by European standards.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{crossing}} of the River Lee downstream of the city came from civil engineers employed by Cork Local Authorities and the central government's Department of the Environment in the late 1970s. [...] Cork's suburbs were expanding and traffic was rising as car ownership increased, but the city centre's street plan, {{laid out in the}} late Middle Ages, was ill equipped to cope. [...] The engineers reasoned that the congestion in the city centre and its radial routes was quickly reaching intolerable levels. [...] They pushed through Cork's [...] "LUTS" [...] – Land Use and Transportation Study – plan, to lay down a twenty five-year plan for the orderly growth of transport and land use in the greater Cork area. [...] The transportation proposals combined construction of elements of a ring road, a downstream crossing, and computerised management of traffic on existing roads. This group of engineers became the Technical Steering Committee for the LUTS Plan and at that time consisted of Sean McCarthy, the former City Engineer, W.A. [...] "Liam" [...] Fitzgerald, his successor as City Engineer, Liam Mullins, Cork's County Engineer, John O'Regan, his deputy, B.J. O'Sullivan, the <b>Cork</b> <b>Harbour</b> Engineer, and Sean Walsh and Declan O'Driscoll, the two Assistant Chief Engineering Advisers at the Department of the Environment responsible for the region.
