40|$|Summary &mdash; Data on {{live and}} carcass {{measurements}} {{were collected from}} 314 male Dandarawy chicks (Egyptian strain) from 33 sires and 157 dams using 2 full-sibs per dam. They were weighed, keel and shank length being recorded, and then slaughtered at 12 and 16 weeks of age (one progeny per dam at each age). Carcass weight was recorded. Dressing and giblet percentages were calculated as percentages of the live body weight. The means of live and carcass measurements indicated that our local strain Dandarawy had lower values than the meat type of fowls (broilers). The heritability estimates for weight and length measurements ranged from 0. 6 to 1. 3 calculated from the sire component of variance, but the estimates were very low and not significant for the dressing and giblet percentages. Those estimates indicated the possibility of improving weight and length measurements by individual selection. The phenotypic correlations between 12 and 16 weeks of age were significant for all the traits except the dressing and giblet percentages.

A series of {{conservation and management}} projects were initiated to protect the remnant population, including national surveys and collection of otter carcasses. The recov-ery of the otter in Denmark since the 1980 s was described by four national field surveys in 1984 - 86, 1991, 1996 and 2004 following the standard otter survey method, and by the geo-graphical distribution of otter carcasses collected in 5 -year periods prior to the field surveys. The surveys document {{a substantial increase in}} distribution range during the past 20 years. The number of collected carcasses increased annually by 9. 1 ± 0. 7 % (mean ± S. E.) between 1980 - 2003. The spatial distribution of carcasses collected in the 5 -year period prior to field surveys was correlated with regional site occupancy in field surveys. The implemented man-agement practices are presented and discussed. We conclude that the standard otter survey method is a reliable method to monitor otter distribution range in Danish habitats, and that compiling records of otter casualties is a suitable methods to monitor long-term population trends.

Federal and State scientists and experts ranked this study as the most significant of the bird studies in 1990. The study was performed under a contract awarded by the U. S. Department of Justice, but the Department of the Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Service reimbursed the Department of Justice for the contract and was responsible for its supervision. The study was highly controversial because it involved killing 219 seabirds, immersing them in oil, and placing them in Prince William Sound to track their drift patterns. The study findings, along with other data, were used to extrapolate the likely bird death toll attributable to the Exxon Vuldez oil spill. This study was not finalized until 1996 when it was published by the American Fisheries Society. Abstract: An estimate of total mortality of seabirds from the Exxon Vuldez oil spill was derived from numbers of carcasses collected on shore.

40|$|Objective {{methods of}} pig carcass {{classification}} {{have been applied}} in the EU since 1984. The meth-ods of classification used in different member states are laid down by the relevant EU legislation. The classification of pig carcasses {{is based on the}} lean meat content predicted on the basis of fat and mus-cle measurements taken at specific carcass sites. A high correlation to the carcass lean meat content is a fundamental condition for these measurements. The correlation coefficients reported by Branscheid et al. (1987) for fat and muscle thickness measured between the third and fourth from the last rib were r = – 0. 846 and r = 0. 739, respectively. Somewhat lower coefficients r = – 0. 736 and r = 0. 538 for fat and muscle thickness, respectively, were found by Lagin et al. (1995). Hulsegge et al. (1994) assessed the accuracy of the lean meat content in carcasses and in major cuts when using multiple site meas-urements compared with a single site measurement. They analysed 17 measurement sites and evaluated the accuracy of prediction formulae according to se. The addition of another measurement to the prediction formulae improved this value by 0. 03 to 0. 13 percent points. Šprysl et al.

40|$|Objectives The Mio-Pliocene diatomaceous Pisco Formation, Peru, was {{deposited}} under upwelling {{conditions in}} the Pisco Basin, {{one of the many}} forearc basins scattered along the Peruvian coast. This formation is particularly popular among vertebrate palaeontologists due to its fossil content. Indeed, because of the high spatial concentration and continuous temporal distribution of perfectly preserved fossil marine vertebrate specimens, the Pisco Fm. is classified as a Konservat-Lagerstätte; this term identifies a place or a quarry characterised by exceptional preservation of fossils. Focusing on the sites of Cerro Colorado and Cerro Los Quesos, Ica Desert, Peru, this Thesis aims to understand which mechanisms brought to the formation of the Pisco Lagerstätte and whether the deposition of diatoms contributed to it in any way. Taking into consideration the geology of the area, three hypotheses on the formation of the Pisco Lagerstätte are advanced and investigated in this Thesis: 1) high sedimentation rates: rapid burial is listed in all the paleontology books as the main process that lead to the preservation of fossils. This hypothesis has been already taken into consideration by previous authors as the cause of the formation of the Pisco Lagerstätte. In particular, sedimentation rates of diatom frustules were advocated as responsible for the burial of whale carcasses by these authors. In this Thesis also the hypothesis that volcanic ashes could increase sedimentation rates by enhancing primary production is advanced. 2) anoxic/disossic environment: along the modern eastern Pacific continental margin, high amounts of organic matter produced during upwelling lead to a great consumption of oxygen. In the intermediate waters dissolved oxygen is < 1 ml/L. This same condition may have persisted during the deposition of the Pisco Fm., therefore inhibiting the aerobic decomposition of carcasses on the sea floor. 3) Harmful algal blooms (HABs) : HABs are phenomena known to kill large amounts of marine species. Those blooms are related to different planktonic groups and are known to kill marine organisms either by: a) the production of a large amount of toxins; b) the lowering of dissolved O 2 in the water column (anoxia of the water column). To verify the high sedimentation rates hypothesis, a detailed stratigraphic framework of the sites of Cerro Colorado and Cerro Los Quesos has been carried out, both by means of diatom biostratigraphy and by means of 39 Ar/ 40 Ar ages. Sedimentation rates have been subsequently calculated and discussed. Moreover, because diatomites are often laminated, a lamina-scale study has been carried out on the sediments underlying fossil whales to unravel the seasonality of diatom species deposition and consequently of the water column. This study also provided additional information on yearly sedimentation rates of the Pisco Fm. During the development of both biostratigraphic and lamina-scale studies, particular attention was paid to the identification of potential HABs. Field observations highlighted that most of the fossils at Cerro Colorado and Cerro Los Quesos are wrapped up in carbonatic concretions; analyses revealed that all of them are dolomite nodules. Therefore, a specific investigation on dolomite nodules was undertaken in order to understand whether they {{played a role in the}} formation of the Lagerstätte. Beside the study on the formation of the Lagerstätte, this Thesis aimed to study the role of volcanic ashes deposition on the fertilisation of the ocean surface. Indeed, scientists have recently become aware of the fertilizer role played by volcanic ash: following major volcanic eruptions, airborne volcanic ash may fall onto the ocean surface, where it releases nutrients (NH+ 4, NO- 3, NO- 2, PO 3 - 4, Si) and Fe. The Pisco Fm. is characterized by a great number of ash layers, making the Pisco Fm. a natural laboratory to study this phenomenon in the Neogene. This Thesis aimed to contribute to the development of an investigation method relevant to fossil contexts. Therefore, observations were made both on the field and in the laboratories. The importance of volcanic ashes in increasing primary production takes much more relevance in the general context of this Thesis if this capability is interpreted as the role of ashes in increasing sedimentation rates (therefore further favouring rapid burial of carcasses). Results Results obtained by diatom stratigraphy and tephrochronology converged in stating that the sites of Cerro Colorado and Cerro Los Quesos are late Miocene in age. Results highlight that sedimentation rates in the Pisco Fm. spanned between 19 cm/ka ± 1 to ca. 33 cm/ka (0. 2 mm/a to 0. 3 mm/a). These sedimentation rates are calculated for compacted sediment and can be transformed into ‘real sedimentation rates’ (sedimentation rates for non compacted sediment) applying a compaction factor equal to 60 %; applying this factor, sedimentation rates equal to 32 cm/ka and 55 cm/ka, respectively, are obtained. Taking into account only the yearly sequence of diatom laminae, sedimentation rates reach a peak of 150 cm/ka (1. 5 mm/a) for compacted sediments, equal to a ‘real’ sedimentation rate of 250 cm/ka (2. 50 mm/a). All the listed sedimentation rates are in line with those calculated for Quaternary sediments in high-productivity basins, confirming that sedimentation rates during the deposition of the Pisco Fm. were high but not exceptional. Investigations conducted on laminae were also used to interpret the seasonal stratification that characterised the water column during the deposition of the Pisco Fm. The sequence of terrigenous lamina – Coscinodiscus ooze – mixed lamina (Chaetoceros RS/Thalassionema plus terrigenous material) has been interpreted as the yearly turnover of diatom species in an upwelling environment. The terrigenous lamina represents the austral summer sediment input. Coscinodiscus oozes are the product of the summer flourishing of this genus at the thermo/nutricline and of its subsequent late summer/early autumn sedimentation (the so-called ‘fall dump’) which follows the breakage of the summer water column stratification. The mixed lamina represents the spring bloom. Many clues suggest that sediments of the Pisco were not completely anoxic: 1) the presence of mollusc; 2) the pervasive bioturbations recognised both in the diatom laminae and at the top of tephra; 3) the coupling of fossil vertebrates with dolomite nodules surrounding the fossils themselves. Indeed, if the sediments of the Pisco had been anoxic, due to the high amounts of organic material (diatom cells) exported to the sea floor, dolomite would have precipitated also far from the vertebrate carcasses. On the contrary, dolomite nodules are always coupled to fossils. This means that only in correspondence of the carcasses, oxygen levels were reduced to a point that lead to sulphate-reduction and methanogenesis with consequent precipitation of dolomite. Dolomite nodules have had a pivotal role in preserving the marine vertebrates in the fossils record: rapid dolomitisation prevented the skeletons from being disarticulated and protected bones from chemical and mechanical erosive agents. Therefore fast dolomitisation processes played a pivotal role in the formation of the Pisco Lagerstätte. However, although not exceptional, also high sedimentation rates favoured the complete burial of carcasses under the sea bottom surface, where sulphate reduction, methanogenesis and, consequently complete dolomitisation, were favoured. Sediment porosity, may have favoured rapid burial and dolomitisation of carcasses as well. Indeed, sediment structures underlying some carcasses suggest that carcasses ‘sank’ into the sediment as they arrived at the sea bottom. Finally, I cannot exclude that the high concentration of carcasses in the Pisco Fm. is due to high density of the marine mammal populations in the Pisco Basin during the late Miocene; to answer this question a dedicated study with a more biological approach should be developed. For what the HABs hypothesis is concerned, no evidence harmful diatoms has been found during the development of this Thesis; similarly, the study concerning the enhancing of primary production due to volcanic ashes needs to be further developed and no conclusions can be drawn on at the moment for this hypothesis. As a final statement, I can affirm that the formation of the Pisco Lagerstätte was caused by the concurrence of many diverse ecological factors; however, the geochemical conditions of the sea bottom and high sedimentation rates were certainly two of the most important ones. Dolomite nodules frequently cemented siliciclastic sediments, not only diatomaceous ones, confirming that sedimentation of diatom frustules to the sea floor is to be considered just one of the many factors concurring in the formation of the Pisco Lagersätte, not its principal cause. Obiettivi La Formazione diatomica Mio-Pliocenica di Pisco, in Perù, si è depositata nel bacino del Pisco, uno dei tanti bacini forearc che caratterizzano la costa peruviana, in condizioni di upwelling. Questa formazione è particolarmente popolare tra i paleontologi dei vertebrati grazie al suo contenuto in fossili. Infatti, a causa dell’elevata concentrazione spaziale di esemplari fossili perfettamente conservati e del loro record temporale continuo, la Pisco Fm. è classificata come un Konservat-Lagerstätte; questo termine identifica un luogo o una formazione caratterizzati da un’eccezionale conservazione dei fossili. Ponendo il fuoco sui siti di Cerro Colorado e Cerro Los Quesos (deserto di Ica, Perù), questa Tesi si propone di capire quali meccanismi hanno portato alla formazione del Pisco Lagerstätte e se la deposizione delle diatomee ne abbia in qualche modo favorito la formazione. Prendendo in considerazione la geologia della zona, sono state avanzate e studiate tre ipotesi: 1) alti tassi di sedimentazione: il rapido seppellimento è elencato in tutti i libri di paleontologia, come il processo principale che porta alla conservazione dei fossili. Questa ipotesi è già stata presa in considerazione dai precedenti autori come la causa della formazione del Pisco Lagerstätte. In particolare, è stato ipotizzato che siano stati i tassi di sedimentazione dei frustoli delle diatomee a favorire il rapido seppellimento delle <b>carcasse.</b> In questa Tesi viene avanzata anche l'ipotesi che le ceneri vulcaniche possano aver aumentato la produzione biosilicea incrementando, di conseguenza i tassi di sedimentazione delle diatomee stesse. 2) ambiente anossico / disossico: lungo il moderno margine continentale del Pacifico orientale, elevate quantità di materia organica prodotte a causa dell’upwelling portano ad un grande consumo di ossigeno. Nelle acque intermedi ossigeno disciolto è < 1 ml / L. Questa stessa condizione può essere persistita durante la deposizione della Pisco Fm., inibendo quindi la decomposizione aerobica delle <b>carcasse</b> sul fondo del mare. 3) fioriture algali velenose (Harmful algal blooms, HABs) : gli HABs sono fenomeni noti per uccidere grandi quantità di organismi marini. Tali fioriture sono tipiche di diversi gruppi planctonici e sono note per uccidere organismi marini attraverso: a) la produzione di una grande quantità di tossine; b) l'abbassamento di O 2 disciolto nella colonna d'acqua (anossia della colonna d'acqua). Per verificare l'ipotesi relativi ai tassi di sedimentazione è stato realizzato un dettagliato quadro stratigrafico dei siti di Cerro Colorado e Cerro Los Quesos, sia attraverso la biostratigrafia a diatomee, sia per mezzo delle datazioni 39 Ar / 40 Ar. Si è quindi potuto calcolare e discutere i tassi di sedimentazione per i due siti. Dal momento che le diatomiti risultano spesso laminate, è stato intrapreso uno studio a scala di singole lamine per studiare la stagionalità della deposizione delle diverse specie di diatomee, conseguentemente, dei movimenti verticali a cui era sottoposta la colonna d’acqua. Questo studio, che ha preso in considerazione i sedimenti sottostanti i fossili di balena, ha anche fornito ulteriori informazioni sui tassi di sedimentazione annuali della Pisco Fm. Oltre alle osservazioni sui tassi di sedimentazione, sulle condizioni di ossigenazione del fondo del mare e sugli HABs, osservazioni sul campo hanno evidenziato che la maggior parte dei fossili a Cerro Colorado e Cerro Los Quesos sono avvolti in concrezioni carbonatiche; le analisi hanno rivelato che tutti i noduli sono noduli dolomitici. Pertanto, è stata svolta anche un'indagine specifica sui tali noduli per verificarne l’eventuale influenza sulla formazione del Lagerstätte. Accanto allo studio sulla formazione del Pisco Lagerstätte, in questa Tesi si è tentato di evidenziare il ruolo della deposizione delle ceneri vulcaniche nel fertilizzare la superficie dell’oceano. Recentemente, alcuni studi hanno infatti evidenziato il ruolo di fertilizzante della cenere vulcanica: dopo grandi eruzioni, le ceneri possono cadere sulla superficie dell'oceano, dove rilasciano sostanze nutritive (NH+ 4, NO- 3, NO- 2, PO 3 - 4, Si) e Fe. La Formazione di Pisco. è caratterizzata da numerosi di livelli di cenere, rendendo la Pisco Fm. un laboratorio naturale per studiare questo fenomeno nel Neogene. A riguardo, l’obiettivo di questa tesi è stato quello di sviluppare un metodo di indagine applicabile ai contesti fossili. Pertanto, sono state effettuate osservazioni sui livelli di cenere sia sul campo che in laboratorio. Nel contesto generale di questa tesi, uno studio sulla capacità di fertilizzazione delle ceneri vulcaniche acquista rilevanza se si considera la potenziale influenza di questo fenomeno sull’incremento della velocità di sedimentazione delle diatomee (favorendo quindi ulteriormente il rapido seppellimento delle <b>carcasse).</b> Risultati I risultati ottenuti dalla biostratigrafia a diatomee e dalla tefrocronologia convergono nell'affermare che i siti di Cerro Colorado e Cerro Los Quesos sono di età tardo miocenica. I risultati mettono in evidenza che i tassi di sedimentazione della Pisco Fm. oscillano tra i 19 cm / ka ± 1 e ca. 33 cm / ka (0, 2 mm / a 0, 3 mm / a). Questi tassi di sedimentazione sono calcolati per sedimenti compattati e possono essere trasformati in 'tassi di sedimentazione effettivi' (velocità di sedimentazione per i sedimenti non compattati) applicando un fattore di compattazione pari al 60 %; in questo modo si ottengono rispettivamente tassi di sedimentazione pari a 32 cm / ka e 55 cm / ka. Tenendo conto solo la sequenza annuale di deposizione delle diatomee (studiata attraverso le lamine), i tassi di sedimentazione raggiungono un picco di 150 cm / ka (1, 5 mm / a) per sedimenti compattati, pari a un tasso di sedimentazione 'reale' di 250 cm / ka (2, 50 mm / a). Tutti i tassi di sedimentazione elencati sono in linea con quelli calcolati per sedimenti quaternari in bacini sedimentari ad alta produttività primaria, confermando che i tassi di sedimentazione durante la deposizione del Pisco Fm. erano alti, ma non eccezionali. Le indagini condotte sulle lamine sono state utilizzate per interpretare la stratificazione stagionale che caratterizzava la colonna d'acqua durante la deposizione della Pisco Fm. La sequenza lamina terrigena - Coscinodiscus ooze - lamina mista (Chaetoceros RS / Thalassionema e materiale terrigeno) è stata interpretata come la sequenza annuale di deposizione del sedimenti in un ambiente di upwelling. La lamina terrigena rappresenta l'input di sedimenti nel bacino durante l’estate australe. Gli oozes a Coscinodiscus sono il prodotto della fioritura estiva di questo genere a livello del nutri/termoclino e della successiva deposizione durante la fine dell’estate / inizio autunno (il cosiddetto fenomeno del 'fall dump') che consegue alla rottura della stratificazione della colonna d'acqua. La lamina mista rappresenta infine la fioritura primaverile. Molti indizi suggeriscono che i sedimenti del Pisco non erano completamente anossici durante la deposizione della formazione stessa. Infatti si è osservato: 1) la presenza di molluschi; 2) diffuse bioturbazioni sia nelle laminazioni a diatomee, sia al top dei livelli di ceneri; 3) l'associazione dei vertebrati fossili ai noduli dolomitici che circondano i fossili stessi. Infatti, se i sedimenti del Pisco fossero stati anossici, l’elevata quantità di materia organica (diatomee) esportata al fondo dell’oceano, avrebbe causato la precipitazione della dolomite anche lontano dalle <b>carcasse</b> dei vertebrati. Al contrario, i noduli dolomitici sono sempre associati ai fossili. Ciò significa che solo in corrispondenza delle <b>carcasse</b> i livelli di ossigeno venivano ridotti al punto tale da attivare i processi che causano la precipitazione della dolomite, vale a dire riduzione dei solfati e metanogenesi. Gli studi condotti sui noduli dolomitici hanno rivelato che questi hanno favorito la preservazione dei vertebrati marini nel record fossile: la rapida dolomitizzazione ha infatti inibito la disarticolazione delle scheletri e li ha protetti dagli agenti erosivi, chimici e meccanici, che agiscono sul fondo dell’oceano. Pertanto, i rapidi processi di dolomitizzazione hanno svolto un ruolo fondamentale nella formazione del Pisco Lagerstätte. A questi hanno contribuito gli alti tassi di sedimentazione che, seppur non eccezionali, hanno favorito la completa sepoltura delle <b>carcasse</b> sotto la superficie di fondo del mare, dove hanno luogo riduzione dei solfati e metanogenesi,favorendo, di conseguenza, una rapida dolomitizzazione. La porosità dei sedimenti può aver a sua volta favorito una rapida sepoltura e dolomitizzazione delle <b>carcasse.</b> Infatti, le strutture sedimentarie sottostanti alcune <b>carcasse</b> suggeriscono che queste ‘affondarono’ nel sedimento una volta arrivate sul fondo...|$|E

Polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially those from n- 3 group, become very important for nutritionists because they play a significant role in prevention of stress induced diseases and of those induced by improper diets (Barlow and Pike, 1991; Albrecht and Klein, 1995). Polyunsaturated n- 3 fatty acids decrease the risk of heart diseases and psoriasis. Moreover, they are necessary for normal develop-ment of brain and nerve tissue (Leaf and Weber, 1988; Barlow and Pike, 1991). Altering the fat composition in broiler diets by inclusion of some feeds results in so called “designed ” meat, rich in n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as α-lino-lenic (C 18 : 3 n- 3), eicosapentaenoic (C 20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic (C 22 : 6 n- 3), as stated by Haumann (1993). Plant sources of fats, rich in n- 3 fatty acids, are added to broiler diets in order to improve the fatty acid profile of meat and eggs, keeping in mind the satisfactory flavour of the same product (Chanmugam et al., 1992; Ajuyah et al., 1993). e seed of flax and some grasses is rich in α-lino-lenic and linoleic fatty acids while sunflower seed is rich in linoleic acid. Rape seed contains consider-able amounts of α-linolenic and linoleic fatty acids too, therefore it is used as a source of protein and energy for broiler diets in many countries. e possibilities of increasing the α-linolenic fatty acid content using rape products were demonstrated by researches of Zollitsch et al. (1993), Lettner and Zollitsch (1993), Kralik et al. (1997) and Lopez-Ferrer et al. (1997).

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to assess the}} effect of the method of {{castration}} on the characteristics of pork and assess the effect of gender on the composition of a carcass. Carcass value is expressed in quantitative and qualitative characteristics that affect the value of the carcass. The quality of the <b>carcasse</b> is also involved internal factors which influence gender significantly influences the composition of the carcase and quality. Significant impact on meat quality in fattening male pigs have boar odor. Boar odor is strongly linked to surgical castration, which appears to be an effective solution for eliminating undesirable odors. Nowadays in the European Union there is a higher pressure on pigs welfare and thus to enforce the ban on surgical castration of piglets which is painful and stressful. Therefore is one of several options to eliminate boar odor using an immunological castration, which is nowadays the subject of many studies and brings very positive results. The purpose of our test was to compare groups of barrows, gilts, entire boars and imunocastrated boars and monitor the composition of the carcasses, meat quality and level of skatole and androstenone and confirm the hypothesis that the influence of various types of castration of boars, barrows and imunocastrated boars show different quality pork meat. Significant effect of gender on the composition of pig carcasses was proved whenboars and imunocastrated boars achieved the highest growth ability. On the contrary, gilts had the lowest growth ability. During fattening was determined highest daily gain in a group of barrows at favorable feed conversion and higher daily consumption compared to other groups of pigs. Also, barrows achieved best results in some parameters of carcass value, such as carcass weight and carcass yield of the hull on the contrary lean muscle ratio had the lowest percentage in comparison to other categories. Barrows were characterized by the highest thickness of back fat. A higher ratio of back fat was also determined in the group of imunocastrates who are otherwise characterized by good growth ability and quality of the carcass hull, whose parameters equal group of boars. The immunological castration of imunocastrated boars caused weight reduction of sexual glands and stopped their physiological activity and that led to lower concentration of androstenone and skatolebelow the level of boar odor. Boar odor-causing substances exceeded the levels of acceptabilitytwice in the group of male pigs. The group of gilts was evaluated with best results in major meaty parts ratio of both weight and percentage of weight of the carcass of the hull. Gilts were characterized with the highest meat ration the leg and in the roast. Boars had the best neck ration and weight and imunocastrated boar had the best shoulders parameters. Influence of gender had no significant impact on the quality parameters of meat...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is the study of}} the {{simulation}} of electrically large structures and the application of the results to automotive Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC). The theoretical and experimental work carried out has {{led to the development of}} computational tools and to the further understanding of the mechanisms involved in the representation of solid surfaces by means of wire-grid simplifications. The work was done in the context of a European project GUIDELINES FOR ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY MODELLING FOR AUTOMOTIVE REQUIREMENTS (GEMCAR). The first two chapters of the thesis contain a description of the GEMCAR project, a brief overview of some of the existing numerical methods for electromagnetic simulations (particularly, the ones used in GEMCAR), and the explanation of efficient, general simulation strategies that can be applied to different methods. The concept of adaptive sampling and its application are also introduced there. The main original contributions of this thesis are presented in Chapters 3 through 6. They consist of theoretical and experimental work as follows. We present, in Chapter 3, a modified version of the Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC). This version, which we have called Parallel NEC, has been adapted to run on parallel supercomputers, taking advantage of the combined processing power and memory of several processors working as a team. Parallel NEC has been implemented in two different supercomputing architectures to test the portability of the code. The original NEC routines in charge of the calculation and filling of the interaction matrix have been modified to work in a parallel environment. The matrix is now distributed among the available processors and the elements of the matrix are locally and individually calculated by their "owners". Thus the number of integrals carried out to build the complete matrix equation gets shared, diminishing the necessary runtime for this time-consuming operation. The system of equations is also solved using a parallel version of the Gauss-Doolitle algorithm. However, the most important feature of Parallel NEC is the possibility to use the distributed memory of the processors. This allows the calculation of problems of a size never achieved before using this numerical method without the need of using disk-space as swap memory. The code has been tested with models containing over 20. 000 segments, exhibiting execution times comparable to those obtained with a single-processor PC calculating models of one tenth of that size in terms of the number of segments. Parallel NEC is also able to adapt itself automatically to its environment. It will detect the number of available processors and will take advantage of all available memory and calculating resources. The validation of Parallel NEC has been carried out in two steps. First, it was validated using simulation results obtained with other numerical methods. Then, it was validated by using experimental data from the GEMCAR project. The experimental setup as well as the validation are presented in Chapter 4. With the purpose of validating the numerical models developed in GEMCAR, we participated in a number of experimental campaigns carried out at Spiez, Switzerland in 2000 and 2001 using the VERIFY (Vertical EMP Radiating Indoor Facility), an EMP simulator belonging to the Swiss Defense Procurement Agency. Measurements of electric and magnetic fields inside a real vehicle (a Volvo S 80) featuring different levels of complexity were carried out. These measurements were performed at 8 different points inside the car and at two points on the surface of the body-shell. The above-mentioned levels of complexity consisted of (1) a "simple test case", comprising the vehicle body-shell (without all doors or glazing), (2) a "medium complexity case" which, this time, included the doors, and (3) a "complex case", consisting of the complete car with all mechanical, electrical and electronic equipment installed. The data used in Chaper 4 refer to the "simple test case", although the "medium test case" measurements are also available. Other partners of the GEMCAR project carried out experimental testing on the three models using other sources of illumination (see Chapters 1 and 4). It is interesting to mention for completeness that, as part of the GEMCAR project, a cable harness was installed following the approximate path of the original cabling of the car, but composed of single wires with 50 R terminations. Current measurements were made at 4 observation points located at the ends of the branches of the harness. These current measurements are not given here as the subject of this thesis was limited to field measurements and simulations only 1. The developed code was applied to analyze the penetration of electromagnetic fields inside the vehicle's body shell (i. e., the simple case). The computed results agree well with those obtained with the other methods and with the experimental data obtained from measurements. The application of the code to such a large problem permitted the observation of some issues raised by the application of the so-called Equal Area Rule (EAR) for the calculation of the segments' lengths and radii. In Chapter 5, we discuss the wire-grid representation of metallic surfaces in numerical electromagnetic modeling. We present the origins and the evolution of surface wire-grid modeling and, considering two types of geometries, namely (I) a simple cube, and (2) a complex structure represented by the metallic car shell used in Chapter 4, we show that the Equal Area Rule is accurate as long as the wire-grid consists of a simple square mesh. For more complex body-fitted meshes, such as rectangular and triangular grids, the Equal Area Rule appears to be less accurate in reproducing the electromagnetic field scattered by metallic bodies. In Chapter 6 we present a theoretical development that leads, for the case of a square grid representation of a surface, to the same formula proposed by the Equal Area Rule. This development is, to the best of our knowledge, the first physical and mathematical interpretation of the EAR as of today. Our development shows, however, a different value for the radius of the segments if the representation of the surface uses other polygons, such as in the case of a rectangular or a triangular mesh. To compare the two methods (the traditional versus the new EAR), we carried out a simple numerical test and found that the Equal Area Rule does not always predict the optimum wire radius for the mesh-representation of a surface.

L'objectif de ce travail de thèse est l'étude de la simulation de structures électriquement grandes et l'application des résultats aux problèmes de compatibilité électromagnétique (CEM) dans l'industrie automobile. Les travaux théoriques et expérimentaux effectués ont permis le développement d'outils numériques et l'amélioration de la compréhension des mécanismes impliqués dans la représentation des surfaces solides en utilisant des maillages segmentés. Le travail a été effectué dans le cadre d'un projet Européen GUIDELINES FOR ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY MODELLING FOR AUTOMOTIVE REQUIREMENTS (GEMCAR). Les premiers deux chapitres de se travail de thèse contiennent une description du projet GEMCAR, une brève vue d'ensemble des quelques méthodes numériques existants pour les simulations électromagnétiques (en particulier, ceux utilisés dans GEMCAR), et l'explication d'efficaces stratégies générales de simulation qui peuvent être appliquées aux différentes méthodes. Le concept d'échantillonnage adaptatif et son application y sont aussi introduits. Les principales contributions originales de cette thèse sont présentées dans les chapitres 3 à 6. Elles comportent les parties expérimentales et théoriques suivantes. Nous avons présenté dans le chapitre 3, une version modifiée du Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC). Cette version que nous avons appelé Parallel NEC a été adaptée pour tourner sur des superordinateurs parallèles, profitant de la puissance de calcul et de la mémoire combinés de plusieurs processeurs travaillant en équipe. Parallel NEC a été implémenté sur deux superordinateurs aux architectures différentes pour tester la portabilité du code. Les routines originales du NEC responsables du calcul et de la construction de la matrice d'interaction ont été modifiées pour travailler dans un environnement parallèle. La matrice est désormais distribuée parmi les processeurs à disposition et les éléments de la matrice sont calculés localement et individuellement par leurs "propriétaires". De ce fait, le nombre d'intégrales calculées pour compléter l'équation matricielle se partage, diminuant ainsi le temps de calcul nécessaire pour cette longue opération. Le système d'équations est aussi résolu en utilisant une version parallèle de l'algorithme de Gauss-Doolitle. Cependant, la caractéristique la plus importante de Parallel NEC est la possibilité d'utiliser la mémoire partagée des processeurs. Ceci permet le calcul de problèmes d'une dimension jamais réalisée auparavant en utilisant cette méthode numérique sans avoir à utiliser le disque dur comme mémoire virtuelle. Le code a été testé avec des modèles contenant plus de 20. 000 segments, montrant des temps d'exécution comparables à ceux obtenus avec un PC monoprocesseur calculant des modèles d'un dixième de cette taille en termes de nombre de segments. Parallel NEC est aussi capable de s'adapter automatiquement à son environnement. Il détecte le nombre de processeurs disponibles et profite de toute la mémoire et des ressources de calcul. La validation de Parallel NEC a été réalisée en deux étapes. Premièrement, il a été validé en utilisant des résultats de simulations obtenus avec d'autres méthodes numériques. Puis, il a été validé en utilisant des données expérimentales provenant du projet GEMCAR. La configuration expérimentale ainsi que la validation sont exposées dans le chapitre 4. Afin de valider les modèles numériques développés dans GEMCAR, nous avons participé à un certain nombre de campagnes expérimentales réalisées à Spiez, Suisse en 2000 et 2001 en utilisant le VERIFY (Vertical EMP Radiating Indoor FacilityY), un simulateur EMP appartenant au Groupement de l'Armement Suisse. Des mesures de champs électrique et magnétique ont été effectuées dans une véritable automobile (une Volvo S 80) avec différents niveaux de complexité. Ces mesures ont été effectuées en 8 points différents dans la voiture et en deux points sur la surface de la carrosserie. Les niveaux de complexité mentionnés précédemment consistent en (1) un "cas de test simple", comprenant la <b>carcasse</b> du véhicule (sans les portes ni les vitres), (2) un "cas de complexité moyenne" avec cette fois-ci les portes et (3) un "cas complexe", consistant en une voiture complète avec tous les équipements mécaniques, électriques et électroniques installés. Les donnés utilisées dans le chapitre 4 se rapportent au "cas de test simple" bien que les mesures du "cas de complexité moyenne" soient aussi disponibles. D'autres partenaires du projet GEMCAR ont réalisé des tests expérimentaux sur les trois modèles utilisant d'autres types de sources d'illumination (voir chapitres 1 et 4). Il est intéressant de mentionner que dans le cadre du projet GEMCAR, un câblage a été installé suivant un chemin approché à celui du câblage original de la voiture, mais composé d'un seul fil terminé avec 50 R. Des mesures de courant ont été prélevées à 4 points d'observation localisés aux extrémités des branches du câble. Ces mesures de courant ne sont pas présentées ici puisque le sujet de cette thèse a été limité exclusivement aux mesures et simulations de champs électromagnétiques 1. Le code développé a été appliqué pour analyser la pénétration de champs électromagnétiques dans la <b>carcasse</b> du véhicule. Les résultats numériques sont en bon accord avec ceux obtenus en utilisant d'autres méthodes numériques et avec les données expérimentales. L'application du code sur un problème de telles dimensions a permis l'observation de quelques problèmes provenant de l'utilisation de la dite Equal Area Rule (EAR) pour le calcul de la longueur et le rayon des segments représentant une surface métallique. Dans le chapitre 5, nous discutons la représentation des surfaces métalliques par un maillage de conducteurs (wire-grid) dans la simulation numérique. Nous avons présenté les origines et l'évolution de la modélisation de surfaces par des maillages, considérant deux types de géométries, à savoir (1) un cube simple, et (2) une structure complexe représentée par la carrosserie métallique de la voiture utilisée dans le chapitre 4. Nous montrons que 1 'Equal Area Rule est précise pour un maillage carré. Pour des maillages plus complexes et plus adaptés aux contours du modèle, tels que les maillages triangulaires, 1 'Equal Area Rule semble être moins exacte pour reproduire le champ électromagnétique au voisinage des objets métalliques. Dans le chapitre 6, nous présentons un développement théorique qui mène, pour le cas de la représentation d'une surface par un maillage rectangulaire, à la même formule proposée par 1 'Equal Area Rule. Ce développement est, au meilleur de notre connaissance, la première interprétation physique et mathématique de 1 'EAR de nos jours. Notre développement montre, cependant, une valeur différente pour les rayons des segments si la représentation de la surface utilise un maillage triangulaire. Pour comparer les deux méthodes (la traditionnelle vs. la nouvelle EAR), nous avons réalisé un test numérique simple. Bien que les résultats ne soient pas concluants, ils suggèrent que la nouvelle EAR (NEAR) donne de meilleurs résultats. [...] 1 Le lecteur intéressé est référé à : A. Rubinstein, F. Rachidi, D.
