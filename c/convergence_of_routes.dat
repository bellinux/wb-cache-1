40|$|Abstract: Current {{multipath}} protocols for Multi-Hop Wireless Networks (MWNs) use routes {{with the}} least hop-count as the default for data transmission. Given a set <b>of</b> multiple <b>routes</b> between a source-destination pair, selecting the best route(s) should depend {{on a variety of}} factors rather than just the hop-count. In this paper we propose a network environment-aware framework for trust-based route selection for MWNs that makes informed and adaptive route-selection decisions. Though we use the Ad-hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV) routing as the underlying representative protocol to build our framework on, the design-logic is generic and suitably modifiable for other specific multipath schemes. We use the term “trust ” to encompass all such metrics pertaining to the quality <b>of</b> a <b>route,</b> i. e., the predicted probability of packets reaching the destination if sent on that route. In our scheme a node quantifies trust values for its neighboring nodes and for the routes that pass through it. Our scheme uses an incentive-and-penalty system to encourage non-selfish and cooperative node behavior towards routing network traffic. The trust metric framed in this protocol is self learning and adaptive. It adjusts to varying network conditions and quick <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> the protocol implies that it works well in mobility scenarios. Glomosim simulations demonstrate the improvement in throughput over conventional AOMDV under scenarios of congestion, link failures and route unreliability. Simulations also demonstrate the quick <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> trusts corresponding to changing route conditions and the corresponding rescheduling of traffic resulting in the increased throughput...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Fast <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> BGP <b>routes,</b> {{coupled with}} reduced message {{complexity}} form {{one of the}} key factors determining the stability and performance of inter-domain routing in the Internet. This paper characterizes the impact of topology and the message handling procedure of BGP on its convergence time. For BGP router networks characterized by random graphs, we obtain analytic expressions to evaluate the convergence times {{in terms of the number}} <b>of</b> Minimum <b>Route</b> Advertisement Interval (MRAI) timer rounds. We then isolate artifacts in the BGP message handling procedure which lead to redundant MRAI timer instances and propose minor but effective modifications which significantly reduce the convergence times. Simulation results show that the proposed changes can successfully eliminate all redundant instantiations of the MRAI timer, even in the worst case convergence scenarios resulting from route withdrawals.

40|$|Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) {{has time}} {{complexity}} O(t*m*N*N), and its typical application is to solve Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where t, m, and N denotes the iteration number, number of ants, number of cities respectively. Cutting down running time {{is one of}} study focuses, and {{one way is to}} decrease parameter t and N, especially N. For this focus, the following method is presented in this paper. Firstly, design a novel clustering algorithm named Special Local Clustering algorithm (SLC), then apply it to classify all cities into compact classes, where compact class is the class that all cities in this class cluster tightly in a small region. Secondly, let ACO act on every class to get a local TSP route. Thirdly, all local TSP routes are jointed to form solution. Fourthly, the inaccuracy of solution caused by clustering is eliminated. Simulation shows that the presented method improves the running speed of ACO by 200 factors at least. And this high speed is benefit from two factors. One is that class has small size and parameter N is cut down. The route length at every iteration step is convergent when ACO acts on compact class. The other factor is that, using the <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> length as termination criterion of ACO and parameter t is cut down. Comment: 21 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

Transport risk, which is usually combined with other attributes such as cost or travel time, {{plays a significant role}} in determining paths for hazardous materials transportation. Since, risk is chaotically affected by road incidents, decision makers are dealing with selecting a method for defining chaotic risk factors in hazmat transportation. In this paper, transport risk has been defined as a chaotic variable using two different methods of generating chaotic patterns. In an experimental road network, which consists of eighty-nine nodes and one hundred and one two-way links, two different methods of generating chaotic variables have been used for applying the proposed procedure. In addition, results for different amounts of risk and cost have also been analyzed in case study.

40|$|Abstract — Geographic {{forwarding}} {{has been}} widely studied as a routing strategy for large wireless networks, mainly due to the low complexity of the routing algorithm, scalability of the routing information with network size and fast <b>convergence</b> times <b>of</b> <b>routes.</b> On a planar network with no holes, Gupta and Kumar (2000) have shown that a uniform traffic demand of is achievable. However, in a network with routing holes (regions on the plane which do not have active nodes), geographic routing schemes such as GPSR or GOAFR could cause the throughput capacity to significantly drop due to concentration of traffic {{on the face of}} the holes. Similarly, geographic schemes could fail to support non-uniform traffic patterns due to spatial congestion (traffic concentration) caused by greedy “straight-line ” routing. In this paper, we first propose a randomized geographic routing scheme that can achieve a throughput capacity of (within a poly-logarithmic factor) even in networks with routing holes. Thus, we show that our scheme is throughput optimal (up to a poly-logarithmic factor) while preserving the inherent advantages of geographic routing. We also show that the routing delay incurred by our scheme is within a poly-logarithmic factor of the optimal throughput-delay trade-off curve. Next, we construct a geographic forwarding based routing scheme that can support wide variations in the traffic requirements (as much as rates for some nodes, while supporting for others). We finally show that the above two schemes can be combined to support non-uniform traffic demands in networks with holes. I...|$|R

Criticisms come in two flavors: (i) the study presents isolated and potentially random feature interactions, and (ii) the parameters used in the study may not be representative of real-world conditions. The first issue (random isolated results) can be addressed by large-scale experiment design techniques that extract maximum information and confidence from a minimum number of carefully designed experiments. Such techniques can be used to find “good ” results fast to guide either incremental protocol design or operational parameter tuning. The second issue (representativeness) is more problematic and relates to formulating benchmarks that to the greatest possible extent characterize the structure of the system under study. In this paper, we explore both cases, i. e. large-scale experiment design and black-box optimization (i. e. large-dimensional parameter state space search) using a realistic network topology with bandwidth and delay metrics to analyze <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> network <b>route</b> paths in the Open Shortest Path First (OSPFv 2) protocol. By using the Recursive Random Search (RRS) approach to design of experiments, we find: (i) that the number of simulation experiments is reduced by an order of magnitude when compared to full-factorial design approach, (ii) it allowed the elimination of unnecessary parameters, and (iii) it enabled the rapid understanding of key parameter interactions. From this design of experiment approach, we were able to abstract away large portions of the OSPF model which resulted in a execution time improvement of 100 fold. ...|$|R
