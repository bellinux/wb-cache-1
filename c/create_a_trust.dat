5|$|The {{creation}} of express trusts in English law must involve four elements for the trust to be valid: capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity {{refers to the}} settlor's ability to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust.</b> There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. The trust instrument must show certainty of intention to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust,</b> certainty of what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and certainty of who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees.|$|E
5|$|As {{a general}} rule, {{there is no}} {{requirement}} for particular formalities in trust instruments, they can be oral or written. The only requirement is that they show an intention to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust.</b> The exceptions are where it is a transfer of land, the transfer of existing equitable interests, or where the trust is made in a will.|$|E
5|$|Moss was {{the founder}} and {{director}} of Moss Electrical Co Ltd, and owned 950 of the 1,000 available shares. In September 1986 he said that Hunter, the finance director, could have 50 of these shares as part of his employment. Crucially, he made no statement or trust involving the other 900 shares. This gift of 50 shares was never implemented because of tax concerns, the risks of a takeover, and mainly because Moss changed his mind. Hunter brought a case against Moss claiming his 50 shares, which rested on two issues. First, whether the language used was sufficient to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust,</b> and second, whether or not the trust failed to provide the three certainties {{because of the lack of}} segregation between the shares.|$|E

5|$|The tribe then {{appealed the}} case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appellate court found that various federal laws {{required}} the DOI and BIA to maintain historic buildings and to maintain Indian trust properties, but that they did not authorize monetary damages. The court then looked to the 1960 act and determined that this act did <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> relationship that could be enforced with monetary damages. This was based on common law, with the court referencing the Restatement (Second) of Trusts to outline that a trust requires a trustee (the United States), a beneficiary (the tribe), and a trust body (the land and buildings). The court noted that both parties agreed that there was a trust, but not that damages were authorized. The court held that where the United States had control over the use and maintenance of the buildings to the exclusion of the tribe, a fiduciary duty was created that authorized the tribe to seek monetary damages. The court then reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court. The United States appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E
25|$|Express trusts {{are those}} {{expressly}} declared by the settlor. Typically, {{this will be}} intended to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust,</b> but there can be situations in which the settlor's intended actions <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> accidentally, as in Paul v Constance. The creation of express trusts must involve four elements for the trust to be valid. These are capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity refers to the donor's ability to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust.</b> There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. These are that the trust instrument must show certainty of intention to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust,</b> certainty of what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and certainty of who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees. For chattels, this can simply be handing the property to them, while transfers of land and shares must be done in writing following certain prescribed forms.|$|E

25|$|As the {{shipping}} industry prospered {{in the late}} 19th century, some sought to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> that would monopolize U.S. shipping companies. However, all negotiations in this regard in the 1890s fell short. The intervention of John Pierpont Morgan, {{one of the richest}} men in the world, would change that.|$|E
25|$|Implied trust: An implied trust, as {{distinct}} from an express trust, is created {{where some of the}} legal requirements for an express trust are not met, but an intention on behalf of the parties to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> can be presumed to exist. A resulting trust may be deemed to be present where a trust instrument is not properly drafted and a portion of the equitable title has not been provided for. In such a case, the law may raise a resulting trust {{for the benefit of the}} grantor (the creator of the trust). In other words, the grantor may be deemed to be a beneficiary of the portion of the equitable title that was not properly provided for in the trust document.|$|E
25|$|Express trust: An {{express trust}} arises where a settlor {{deliberately}} and consciously decides to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust,</b> over their assets, either now, or upon {{his or her}} later death. In these cases this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument, which will either be a will or a trust deed. Almost all trusts {{dealt with in the}} trust industry are of this type. They contrast with resulting and constructive trusts. The intention of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct. For an express trust to exist, there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the trust property. In the USA Statute of Frauds provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the trust property is above a certain value, or is real estate.|$|E

500|$|The first {{requirement}} of an express trust is capacity; the person creating the trust must be legally {{capable of doing}} so. Generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can form a trust, although there are exceptions. A minor cannot hold land, and therefore cannot <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> of land; in addition, unless they are soldiers or [...] "mariners at sea", they cannot form a valid will. Where a minor tries to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust,</b> it will be held voidable, and can be repudiated by him when he reaches majority, or soon after. Where the trust is clearly of detriment to the minor, the courts may decide to take it as void; the individual, when he reaches majority, could alternately plead non est factum {{if he had been}} too young to appreciate the nature of forming a trust. People who are considered mentally disordered (under the Mental Health Act 1983) and have a receiver appointed cannot have trusts directly enforced against them, as they no longer have control over their property. Where there is no receiver, the mentally disordered person's trust will be held void, unless it was made during a lucid period when the person was capable of understanding their actions. Corporations and statutory bodies only have the powers granted to them by their memorandum of association or authorising statute; if these do not authorise the creation of trusts, any such trust will be held to be ultra vires.|$|E
500|$|Evidential issues also exist. Because secret trusts are by {{definition}} secret, they {{are difficult to}} prove in court. The parol evidence rule states that where there is written evidence, oral testimony cannot be introduced to the court if it contradicts that evidence. Since secret trusts are oral and normally exist outside of the will (a written document) this causes problems. In Re Keen, the issue came up, and the Court of Appeal decided that the parol evidence rule extended to secret trusts, and such trusts could not be enforced if they contradicted written documents. More generally, the problem is proving that the testator intended to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust.</b> As in McCormic v Grogan, the standard is high; the person trying to enforce the trust must show [...] "most clearly and distinctly" [...] that it exists.|$|E

5000|$|Jones v Lock (1865) 1 Ch App 25 is <b>an</b> English <b>trusts</b> law case, {{concerning}} the formality for <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> gift, {{and the possibility}} that if the gift were not properly completed with the required legal form, <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> could be found. It held that equity would not [...] "perfect an imperfect gift" [...] by <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust,</b> if the proper formality for the gift had not been completed.|$|R
500|$|Trusts {{have been}} used as a way around the {{original}} doctrine of privity. A trust is an arrangement where the owner of property gives it to a second party (a trustee) to manage on behalf of a third party (a beneficiary). In this situation the House of Lords decided (in Les Affréteurs v Walford [...] AC 801) that the trustee's ability to sue the owner of the property is to be exercised on behalf of the beneficiary, a third party. This is known as a [...] "trust of the promise", and, while artificial, it bypassed the doctrine of privity. The trust exception has been heavily undermined by the decision in Re Schebsman [...] Ch 83, which requires a court to find evidence of an intent to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> of the promise rather than simply using the requirement as an intention as a fiction to allow the courts to enact the trust exception.|$|E
500|$|For {{an express}} trust to be valid, the trust {{instrument}} must show certainty of intention, {{subject matter and}} object. Certainty of intention means {{that it must be}} clear that the settlor or testator wishes to create a trust; this is not dependent on any particular language used, and a trust can be created without the word [...] "trust" [...] being used, or even the settlor knowing he is creating a trust. Since the 1950s, the courts have been more willing to conclude that there was intention to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust,</b> rather than hold that the trust is void. Certainty of subject matter means that it must be clear what property is part of the trust. Historically the property must have been segregated from non-trust property; more recently, the courts have drawn a line between tangible and intangible assets, holding that with intangible assets there is not always a need for segregation. Certainty of objects means that it must be clear who the beneficiaries, or objects, are. The test for determining this differs {{depending on the type of}} trust; it can be that all beneficiaries must be individually identified, or that the trustees must be able to say with certainty, if a claimant comes before them, whether he is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
500|$|The first {{principle}} {{when deciding}} {{if there is}} certainty of intention {{is the nature of}} the language used; the words, as said in Wright v Atkyns, [...] "must be imperative". Past this, there is no requirement that particular language be used. In Re Kayford, Megarry J held that [...] "it is well settled that a trust can be created without using the word [...] "trust" [...] or [...] "confidence" [...] or the like; the question is whether in substance a sufficient intention to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> has been manifested". In Paul v Constance, [...] it was held that the phrase [...] "the money is as much yours as it is mine" [...] was sufficient to translate to a trust. A trust will not be formed if it is clear that some other intention was there, such as the intention to make a pure gift, as in Jones v Lock. Historically, precatory words such as [...] "it is hoped" [...] and [...] "it is desired" [...] were held to be valid. Since Lambe v Eames, the courts have instead taken the approach that the circumstances and the reading of the statement as a whole are the factors, and that no particular words will impose a trust on their own.|$|E

5000|$|Justice Thurgood Marshall {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court. Marshall noted that both the Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act waived the sovereign immunity of the United States and allowed the plaintiffs to bring a case to the Court of Claims. Marshall then examined the history of the three statutes that the Court of Claims held <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> relationship with the plaintiffs. He concluded that the plain language of the statutes <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> relationship between the United States government and the plaintiffs. Marshall noted that it is well established that a trustee is liable for damages in cases of a breach of fiduciary duties. He stated that it [...] "naturally follows that the Government should be liable in damages for the breach of its fiduciary duties." [...] The decision of the Court of Claims was affirmed.|$|R
500|$|The {{three certainties}} {{refer to a}} rule within English trusts law on the {{creation}} of express trusts that, to be valid, the trust instrument must show certainty of intention, subject matter and object. [...] "Certainty of intention" [...] means that it must be clear that the donor or testator wishes to create a trust; this is not dependent on any particular language used, and a trust can be created without the word [...] "trust" [...] being used, or even the donor knowing he is creating a trust. Since the 1950s, the courts have been more willing to conclude that there was intention to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust,</b> rather than hold that the trust is void. [...] "Certainty of subject matter" [...] means that it must be clear what property is part of the trust. Historically the property must have been segregated from non-trust property; more recently, the courts have drawn a line between tangible and intangible assets, holding that with intangible assets there is not always a need for segregation. [...] "Certainty of objects" [...] means that it must be clear who the beneficiaries, or objects, are. The test for determining this differs {{depending on the type of}} trust; it can be that all beneficiaries must be individually identified, or that the trustees must be able to say with certainty, if a claimant comes before them, whether he is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
500|$|The trust {{must then}} be {{formally}} constituted, by {{the transfer of}} its property to the trustees. For chattels, merely handing the property to the trustees is sufficient, assuming it comes with the relevant intention to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust.</b> In some circumstances, providing the intention and telling the trustees {{where to find the}} property is sufficient, as in Thomas v Times Books. Where the property is land or an equitable interest in land, it must be transferred by writing in accordance with Sections 52-3 of the Law of Property Act 1925. When dealing with shares, the transfer is not complete until a transfer document has been completed and the company has entered the change of ownership in its books. One of the equitable maxims is that [...] "equity will not assist a volunteer"; if someone does not have an interest in property, they cannot bring a court case. When trusts are not properly constituted, the trustees and beneficiaries have no equitable interest in the property, and so are volunteers. There are several exceptions to this maxim. The courts are willing to hear cases where the transfer was not completed, providing the intended beneficiaries or trustees have gained an interest through being made executor of the settlor's estate (the rule in Strong v Bird), or the gift was given donatio mortis causa, or where the settlor did all he could do, as in Re Rose, or where it would be [...] "unconscionable" [...] to hold the gift invalid, as in Pennington v Waine.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} to create an express trust without being aware that one is doing so, {{so long as the}} court can determine from the person's intention that a beneficial entitlement should be conferred which the law (or equity) will enforce. In the Constance case, Constance was described as a man of [...] "unsophisticated character" [...] who did not know he was creating a trust– nevertheless, the courts found that was what he had done. [...] In Re Kayford, the company involved took actions to protect its customers by moving their funds into a separate bank account. Even though they had never indicated a desire to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust,</b> their intention had been in line with the purpose of a trust, and thus it was considered valid. Many trusts are formed through wills, which create additional issues when determining intention. In Re Hamilton, Lindley LJ set out the standard rule that to [...] "take the will you have to construe and see what it means, and if you {{come to the conclusion that}} no trust was intended you say so"; essentially that judges should not simply assume that there is a trust. This literal approach was followed until the 1950s; since then, the judiciary have been more willing to interpret trust documents in such a way as to make the trusts valid rather than void. According to Byrnes v Kendle, the question that needs to be answered in determining whether a certainty of intention exists is [...] "What is the meaning of what the parties have said?" [...] and not [...] "What did the parties mean to say?" ...|$|E
