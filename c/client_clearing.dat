40|$|We use an {{extensive}} data set of bilateral {{credit default swap}} (CDS) positions to estimate the impact on collateral demand of new clearing and margin regula-tions. The estimated collateral demands includes both initial margin as well as frictional requirements associated with the movement of variation margin through the network of market participants. We estimate the impact on total collateral de-mand of more widespread initial margin requirements, increased novation of CDS to central clearing parties (CCPs), {{an increase in the}} number of clearing members, the proliferation of CCPs of both specialized and non-specialized types, collateral rehypothecation practices, and <b>client</b> <b>clearing.</b> System-wide collateral demand is increased significantly by the application of initial margin requirements for dealers, whether or not the CDS are cleared. Given these dealer-to-dealer initial margin requirements, mandatory central clearing is shown to lower, not raise, system-wide collateral demand, provided there is no significant proliferation of CCPs. Central clearing does, however, have significant distributional consequences for collateral requirements across various types of market participants...|$|E

40|$|The global crisis {{triggered}} a vast programme of financial markets reform, {{including a new}} regime for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives which requires hitherto private contracts to be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs). This article argues that the interaction between underlying law and this new regulation {{needs to be addressed}} in order to advance the objectives of the reforms. The starting point for the argument is the two techniques that underpin CCPs: limited access and posting assets, or margin. Having established that access via intermediated or ‘client’ clearing will become increasingly important with mandatory clearing, the article explores the impact of <b>client</b> <b>clearing</b> on the legal rules governing the margin posted by users of a CCP. The detail of the interaction between European regulations on CCP clearing and the UK rules on client assets is considered as an example. The dilemma identified arises because regulation, designed to improve financial stability by mandating clearing, may potentially undermine certain ways in which CCPs promote that outcome. The article concludes that the interaction between underlying law and new regulation needs to be accounted for and addressed at EU level, in order to safeguard the functions that attracted regulators to clearing in the first place...|$|E

30|$|Alternatively, hope {{theory can}} be used to select {{interventions}} that are most likely to increase agentic or pathways thinking or improve social support. For example, the principles of behavioral activation and motivational interviewing might be effectively used to help <b>clients</b> set <b>clear,</b> objective, and meaningful goals that can serve as the targets for treatment. Similarly, cognitive interventions may be particularly useful in helping clients recognize and challenge negative thoughts that rob them of their motivation to work toward their goals. Behavioral activation techniques can provide clients with greater energy to sustain goal pursuit over time. Furthermore, problem-solving and skills training can help individuals marshal social support to cope with stress and adversity. Other positive psychological interventions can be especially useful in increasing well-being and positive affect. Rather than using hope therapy as a first-line treatment, clinicians may wish to use hope theory as a model from which to select evidence-based treatments and to guide their interventions.|$|R
3000|$|Recently, Snyder's (1994) general {{model for}} hope {{has been applied}} to {{psychotherapy}} (Cheavens, Feldman, Woodward, & Snyder, 2006; Lopez, Snyder, Magyar-Moe, Edwards, Pedrotti, Janowski, et al., 2004; Pedrotti, Edwards, & Lopez, 2008; Snyder, 2000; Snyder, Feldman, Taylor, Schroeder, & Adams, 2000; Snyder, Parenteau, Shorey, Kahle, & Berg, 2002). From this perspective, people seek therapy when they repeatedly encounter barriers to their goals which they cannot circumvent or overcome. These barriers engender negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, or anger, which are often the proximal determinants of their decision to seek help. The therapist's job is to increase hope by helping <b>clients</b> set <b>clear,</b> objective goals for treatment and increase agency and pathways thinking Snyder and colleagues (2000). have argued that hope is a common factor in psychotherapy: [...] "Psychotherapies 'work' precisely because they enable people to identify goals that represent solutions to their problems, they specify particular routes for reaching those goals (pathways thinking), and they motivate clients to use those routes so as to implement change (agency thinking)" [...] (pp. 257 - 258).|$|R

40|$|The {{message from}} remote library <b>clients</b> is <b>clear</b> and unequivocal - they want {{material}} quickly and easily. They {{would prefer not}} to have to differentiate between the three library services of intercampus, interlibrary, or off-campus requests - they just want a particular document or book forwarded to them as soon as possible.

Differentiating between individual clients,it displays and activates only those services for which a particular client is eligible.

40|$|Immediate annuities (fixed term, life expectancy) are notionally the {{simplest}} of retirement income products and {{the simplest}} to price. For intending purchasers, the issuing institution?s Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) {{is one of the}} first ports of call. An examination of a selection of immediate annuity PDSs indicates that they fall far short of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission?s requirement that a product issuer, seller, financial adviser etc. provide a retail <b>client</b> with ?<b>clear,</b> concise and effective? information to make an informed choice between similar products.

Given some expertise (which most retirees won?t have), the impact of any given fee structure can be assessed, but only if a current investment reference rate is supplied. As none of the PDSs we surveyed provided such a rate (or its equivalent - the effective after-fees investment rate earned by the annuity purchase price over the term of the annuity), we query whether there is misleading or deceptive conduct under Corporations Act s 1041 H, Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act s 12 DA, 12 DB and whether the PDSs comply with the new PDS requirements fully in force from March 2004. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|In a small network, {{clients and}} servers may all be {{connected}} to a single Ethernet without significant performance concerns. As the number of clients on a network grows, the necessity of splitting the network into multiple sub-networks, each with a manageable number of <b>clients,</b> becomes <b>clear.</b> Less obvious is {{what to do with}} the servers. Group file servers on subnets and multihomed servers offer only partial solutions – many other types of servers do not lend themselves to a decentralized model, and tend to collect on another, well-connected but overloaded Ethernet. The higher speed of FDDI seems to offer an easy solution, but in practice both expense and interoperability problems render FDDI a poor choice. Ethernet switches appear to permit cheaper and more reliable networking to the servers while providing an aggregate network bandwidth greater than a simple Ethernet. This paper studies the evolution of the server networks at SLAC. Difficulties encountered in the deployment of FDDI are described, as are the tools and techniques used to characterize the traffic patterns on the server network. Performance of Ethernet, FDDI, and switched Ethernet networks is analyzed, as are reliability and maintainability issues for these alternatives. The motivations for re-designing the SLAC general server network to use a switched Ethernet instead of FDDI are described, as are the reasons for choosing FDDI for the farm and firewall networks at SLAC. Guidelines are developed which may help in making this choice for other networks...|$|R
40|$|ISBE will {{empower the}} {{experimental}} research community to make modelling {{part of their}} lab routine. Here we discuss how to define and structure ISBE modelling services, building on D 8. 2 's review of the purpose and overall design principles for modelling services. We identify the components of ISBE modelling services and propose an organizational structure to achieve uniform coverage of services from a heterogeneous network of expertises. A roadmap concludes the report, proposing initial low-budget services for selected modelling frameworks, then outlining a strategy for growth and scalability of ISBE modelling services. How to define and structure ISBE modelling services is a many-faceted question. First and foremost, one must identify the purpose of each service (what will it achieve?), which also entails specifying its inputs and outputs. It can be useful to group kinds of services into broader categories, either based on their function, or based on their organizational structure including staffing and funding. Modelling services will include automated analyses of published or user-provided models, fitting of parameters to user data, and refinement and adaptation of existing models. However, it also makes sense to include related services such as stewardship and training in the broad term "modelling services". A coordinating Systems Biology Centre (cSBC) will interconnect national Systems Biology Centres (nSBCs) to make the collective expertise of participating nations easily accessible for all European researchers. Chapter 2. 3 concretizes this with illustrations {{of the variety of}} modelling services that ISBE is likely to offer, and how to route requests from clients to ISBE tools and expertise. Levels of service may range from fully automatic tools to long-term per­sonal involvement, with access to more demanding services prioritized in cooperation with funders. Likewise, there will be several kinds and levels of documentation and user support. We advocate a focus on user needs in prioritizing what ISBE is to offer, in specifying services, and in routing expertise to <b>clients.</b> <b>Clear</b> descriptions of the data requirements for each modelling approach helps clients figure out their options and see what additional data they might require to open more options for modelling. Standardized virtual experiments can form an articulated link between modellers and experimentalists, and can be used to stream­line the confrontation of models with data, e. g. in parameter estimation and model selection. As candidates for pilot services to be offered by the interim "ISBE light", we have identified modelling frameworks that span a wide range of biologically interesting questions within a well-defined set of user inputs. These include ordinary differential equations (where the rates-of-change of state variables {{is a function of the}} current value of those state variables) and constraint-based models (based on stoichiometry in biochemical reaction networks). The demand for modelling services is anticipated to increase sharply once ISBE succeeds in transforming the practice of biological research and application. To meet this demand, we identify five key issues of scalability: Recruitment of providers, routing of clients to providers, strategic focusing of effort, training and education of users, and standardization and curation to streamline knowledge management, each of which is detailed in Chapter 5. 2...|$|R
40|$|Within Western Europe, the 1970 s {{are usually}} {{perceived}} as a decade of uncertainty and decline, marking a turning point towards 'post-industrial' societies.

Six specific issues are raised: mind-fulness {{has been found to be}} unhelpful in some contexts; where mindfulness has been found to be effective, in-structors have derived and shared with <b>clients</b> a <b>clear</b> problem formulation; there may be many dimensions of effectiveness underlying the apparent simplicity of mind-fulness; mindfulness was developed within a particular “view ” of emotional suffering that implies wider changes that go beyond meditation practice alone; professionals need to match the different components of mindfulness with the psychopathology being targeted; nonetheless, mindfulness may affect processes common to different pathologies.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} all {{insider trading}} cases in Hong Kong since a dual {{civil and criminal}} insider trading regime was implemented in 2003. The analysis reveals some significant findings. First, the successful cases prosecuted under the criminal provisions outnumber those brought as civil cases, suggesting that the regulator did not sacrifice the deterrent effect of criminal convictions by using the easier procedures under the civil regime. Second, {{the largest number of}} insider trading contraventions occurred in 2008 when stock markets around the globe were volatile and had a significant downward adjustment. During this period, many people had significant losses, motivating them to cover their losses by illegal means. Third, the most popular corporate information that triggered insider trading activities came from takeovers, as knowledge of these events before their formal announcements enabled insiders and their tippees to reap handsome profits. Finally, the monetary fines imposed on criminal offenders were generally the same as the actual profits obtained or loss avoided with the purpose of disgorging all their benefits. In contrast, imprisonment was positively related to the notional profit (ie, the maximum potential profit that the offender could obtain from trading). These findings suggest that regulators need to be more vigilant during economic downturns and to pay particular attention to takeover and share placement activities in listed companies. For senior corporate insiders, investment bankers and lawyers handling their corporate <b>clients,</b> a <b>clear</b> message that emerges from our findings {{is that it does not}} pay to get involved in illegal insider trading...|$|R
