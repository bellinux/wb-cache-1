50|$|One {{feature of}} the webs of some orb-weavers is the stabilimentum, a {{crisscross}} band of silk {{through the center of}} the web. It is found in a number of genera, but Argiope, the yellow and banded garden spiders of North America, is a prime example. The band has been hypothesized to be a lure for prey, a marker to warn birds away from the web, and a camouflage for the spider when it sits in the center of the web. However, recent research suggests the stabilimentum actually decreases the visibility of the silk to insects, thus making it harder for prey to avoid the web. The orb-web consists of a frame and supporting radii overlaid with a sticky <b>capture</b> <b>spiral,</b> and the silks used by orb-weaver spiders have exceptional mechanical properties to withstand the impact of flying prey.|$|E
30|$|In orb-weaver spiders, web {{building}} behaviour follows {{three distinct}} phases: {{construction of the}} frame and radii, weaving of an auxiliary spiral and weaving of the sticky or <b>capture</b> <b>spiral</b> (Foelix 2011). To weave the <b>capture</b> <b>spiral,</b> the spider starts at the periphery and uses the auxiliary spiral as a guide. During this phase, the spider's legs {{play an important role}} (Vollrath 1987 a). The spider advances step by step to produce the sticky spiral while maintaining the distance between successive turns equally (Vollrath and Mohren 1985). Thus, completion of the <b>capture</b> <b>spiral</b> results from successive and repetitive actions, which is the definition of stereotyped behaviour.|$|E

The <b>capture</b> <b>spiral</b> {{can be considered as}} a succession of threads joining two radii that we call spiral units. As the number of anomalies in a web depends on the total number of spiral units deposited by the spider (Pasquet et al. 2013), we calculated the ratio of anomalies (A) per metre of length of the capture thread (A/CTL).|$|E

Simulations suggested that the density of <b>capture</b> <b>spiral</b> spacing, prey size, and the density of prey should all affect the capture efficiency of a web.

40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that age {{influences}} organism mobility. This was demonstrated in vertebrates (such as mammals and birds) but has been less studied in invertebrates with the exception of Drosophila and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we studied the influence of age on the mobility of the orb-weaving spider Zygiella x-notata during web construction. The orb-web is a good model because it has a characteristic geometrical structure and video tracking can be used to easily follow the spider's movements during web building. We investigated the influence of age (specifically chronological age, life span, and time till death) on different parameters of spider mobility during the construction of the <b>capture</b> <b>spiral</b> (distance traveled, duration of construction, spider velocity, spider movement, and spider inactivity) with a generalized linearmodel (GLM) procedure adjusted for the spidermass. The results showed that neither chronological age, nor life span affected the mobility parameters. However, when the time till death decreased, there was a decrease in the distance traveled, the duration of the construction of the <b>capture</b> <b>spiral,</b> and the spider movement. The spider velocity and the time of inactivity were not affected. These results could be correlated with a decrease in the length of the silky thread deposited for the construction of the <b>capture</b> <b>spiral.</b> Spiders with a shorter time till death built smaller web using less silk. Thus, our study suggests strongly that time till death affects spider mobility during web construction but not the chronological age and thus may be a good indicator of senescence...|$|E

40|$|An {{extended}} Kalman filter based generalized {{state estimation}} approach {{is presented in}} this paper for accurately estimating the states of incoming high-speed targets such as ballistic missiles. A key advantage of this nine-state problem formulation is that it is very much generic and can <b>capture</b> <b>spiraling</b> as well as pure ballistic motion of targets without any change of the target model and the tuning parameters. A new nonlinear model predictive zero-effort-miss based guidance algorithm is also {{presented in this paper}}, in which both the zero-effort-miss as well as the time-to-go are predicted more accurately by first propagating the nonlinear target model (with estimated states) and zero-effort interceptor model simultaneously.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Very {{few studies}} have {{investigated}} the influence of regular practice of a stereotyped behaviour on its future expression. In spiders, orb-web construction is a succession of repetitive and stereotyped behaviours and is a relevant model for such study. This study examined if preventing spiders from building influences their future constructions. Spiders {{were caught in the}} field and brought back to the laboratory where they were exposed to two different situations; half were maintained in small boxes where web building was not possible, and half were maintained in large enclosures where they could build orb-webs. All spiders were tested twice: 1 week after their capture (test 1) and 12 weeks later (test 2). Their building performance was evaluated by examining silk investment (length of the <b>capture</b> <b>spiral,</b> number of radii, of spiral turns, length of {{the lower part of the}} web), web design (mesh height, asymmetry) and the frequency of anomalies in the web. Results: There was no difference in web constructions between the two groups in either test. However, the rearing conditions seemed to affect two parameters: the length of the lower part of the web and the asymmetry were higher for spiders reared in small boxes. We did find also, an overall decrease with time in silk investment (length of the <b>capture</b> <b>spiral,</b> capture area) in both groups as well as an increase in the number of anomalies of the <b>capture</b> <b>spiral</b> from tests 1 to 2. Conclusions: These results suggest that regular web construction does not have a strong effect on web structure or silk investment, but spider age did affect parameters in the two groups. Thus, the lack of practice over a large portion of a spider's adult life does not affect a stereotyped behaviour such as the building of an orb-web...|$|E

40|$|Among animal constructions, spider’s orb webs {{represent}} regular geometrical architecture models. Their {{construction is}} the result of successive, simple and reproducible behavioural patterns, often considered as stereotyped. It has recently been shown that spider’s building behaviours vary, which can alter web regularity. The final <b>capture</b> <b>spiral</b> results from the laying of successive threads between two radii, here termed ‘spiral units’. We defined a theoretical normal web, as a web in which each turn of the final spiral should be parallel to the preceding one. Weaving of the spiral units sometimes leads to anomalies in the orb web. Anomalies were identified and analysed in the orb-weaving spider Zygiella x-notata (Clerck, 1757). From video recordings of web construction, we noted the displacements of the legs and of the abdomen of the spider. We compared the frequency of displacements, and their duration, between the construction of spiral units that produce a normal turn and ones that produce an anomalous turn. The position of the legs on the web’s threads was also analysed. Results showed that anomalies were not the consequences of a modification in activity but more likely the result of the position on the radii of the fourth leg.

40|$|Among {{a myriad}} of spider web geometries, the orb web {{presents}} a fascinating, exquisite example in architecture and evolution. Its structural component, the silk protein, is an exemplary natural material because its superior properties stem intrinsically from the synergistic cooperativity of hierarchically-organized components, {{rather than from the}} particular properties of the building blocks themselves. By bridging together different levels of hierarchy in the web, we elucidate the mechanisms by which structure at each composite level contributes to organization and material phenomena at subsequent levels, demonstrating that the web is a highly adapted system where both material and hierarchical structure across all length-scales is critical for its functional properties. Further, the material hierarchy scheme within the orb web is exploited to address questions of silk evolution. Spider orb webs can be divided into two categories distinguished by the capture silk used in construction: cribellate orb webs composed of pseudoflagelliform silk coated with dry cribellate threads and ecribellate orb webs, composed of viscid flagelliform silk fibers, coated by adhesive glue droplets. Cribellate capture silk is generally stronger but less extensible than viscid capture silk and a body of phylogenic evidence suggests that cribellate capture silk is more closely related to the ancestral form of <b>capture</b> <b>spiral</b> silk. Here, we use a coarse-grained web model to investigate how the mechanical properties of spiral capture silk affect the behavior of the web system, illustrating that more extensible <b>capture</b> <b>spiral</b> silk yields a decrease in the web's energy absorption, suggesting that the function of the <b>capture</b> <b>spiral</b> shifted from prey capture to other structural roles. Additionally, we observe that in webs with more extensible capture silk, the effect of thread strength on web performance is reduced, indicating that thread extensibility is a dominant driving factor in web diversification. In this thesis, we propose a novel model-centered materials-hierarchy based approach to studying evolutionary trends and suggest possible applications for other fields. by Anna Tarakanova. Thesis: S.

The rate of prey capture did not change with age, but older spiders took more time to subdue and capture the prey. Alterations which appeared in web structure with age (increase in the number of anomalies affecting radii and <b>capture</b> <b>spiral)</b> affected prey capture behavior. Furthermore, the analysis of individual performance (carried out on 17 spiders at two different ages) showed that older females spent more time handling the prey and finding it in the web.

40|$|International audienceSilk {{is known}} for its {{strength}} and extensibility and has {{played a key role in}} the radiation of spiders. Individual spiders use different glands to produce silk types with unique sets of proteins. Most research has studied the properties of major ampullate and <b>capture</b> <b>spiral</b> silks and their ecological implications, while little is known about minor ampullate silk, the type used by those spider species studied to date for bridging displacements. A biomechanical model parameterised with available data shows that the minimum radius of silk filaments required for efficient bridging grows with the square root of the spider's body mass, faster than the radius of minor ampullate silk filaments actually produced by spiders. Because the morphology of spiders adapted to walking along or under silk threads is ill suited for moving on a solid surface, for these species there is a negative relationship between body mass and displacement ability. As it stands, the model suggests that spiders that use silk for their displacements are prevented from attaining a large body size if they must track their resources in space. In particular, silk elasticity would favour sexual size dimorphism because males that must use bridging lines to search for females cannot grow large...|$|E
40|$|We {{perform the}} first {{systematic}} study on how dynamical stellar tides and general relativistic (GR) effects affect the dynamics and outcomes of binary-single interactions. For this, we have constructed an N-body code that includes tides in the affine approximation, where stars are modeled as self-similar ellipsoidal polytropes, and GR corrections using the commonly-used post-Newtonian formalism. Using this numerical formalism, {{we are able}} resolve the leading effect from tides and GR across several orders of magnitude in both stellar radius and initial target binary separation. We find that the main effect from tides is the formation of two-body tidal captures that form during the chaotic and resonant evolution of the triple system. The two stars undergoing the <b>capture</b> <b>spiral</b> in and merge. The inclusion of tides can thus {{lead to an increase}} on the stellar coalescence rate. We also develop an analytical framework for calculating the cross section of tidal inspirals between any pair of objects with similar mass. From our analytical and numerical estimates we find that the rate of tidal inspirals relative to collisions increases as the initial semi-major axis of the target binary increases and the radius of the interacting tidal objects decreases. The largest effect is therefore found for triple systems hosting white dwarfs and neutron stars. In this case, we find the rate of highly eccentric white dwarf - neutron star mergers to likely be dominated by tidal inspirals. While tidal inspirals occur rarely, we note that they can give rise to a plethora of thermonuclear transients such as Ca-rich transients. Comment: 17 pages, 14 figure...|$|E
40|$|We have {{conducted}} bivariate and multivariate {{statistical analysis of}} data measuring the integrated luminosity, shape, and potential depth of the Einstein sample of early-type galaxies (presented by Fabbiano et al. 1992). We find significant correlations between the X-ray properties and the axial ratios (a/b) of our sample, such that the roundest systems tend to have the highest L(sub x) and L(sub x) /L(sub B). The most radio-loud objects are also the roundest. We confirm the assertion of Bender et al. (1989) that galaxies with high L(sub x) are boxy (have negative a(sub 4)). Both a/b and a(sub 4) are correlated with L(sub B), but not with IRAS 12 um and 100 um luminosities. There are strong correlations between L(sub x), Mg(sub 2), and sigma(sub nu) {{in the sense that}} those systems with the deepest potential wells have the highest L(sub x) and Mg(sub 2). Thus the depth of the potential well appears to govern both the ability to reatin an ISM at the present epoch and to retain the enriched ejecta of early star formation bursts. Both L(sub x) /L(sub B) and L(sub 6) (the 6 cm radio luminosity) show threshold effects with sigma(sub nu) exhibiting sharp increases at log sigma(sub nu) approximately = 2. 2. Finally, there is clearly an interrelationship between the various stellar and structural parameters: The scatter in the bivariate relationships between the shape parameters (a/b and a(sub 4)) and the depth parameter sigma(sub nu) is a function of abundance in the sense that, for a given a(sub 4) or a/b, the systems with the highest sigma(sub nu) also have the highest Mg(sub 2). Furthermore, for a constant sigma(sun nu), disky galaxies tend to have higher Mg(sub 2) than boxy ones. Alternatively, for a given abundance, boxy ellipticals tend to be more massive than disky ellipticals. One possibility is that early-type galaxies of a given mass, originating from mergers (boxy ellipticals), have lower abundances than 'primordial' (disky) early-type galaxies. Another is that disky inner isophotes are due not to primordial dissipation collapse, but to either the self-gravitating inner disks of <b>captured</b> <b>spirals</b> or the dissipational collapse of new disk structures from the premerger ISM. The high measured nuclear Mg(sub 2) values would thus be due to enrichment from secondary bursts of star formation triggered by the merging event...|$|R

30|$|The third {{result from}} {{this study was the}} absence of a {{difference}} in the number of anomalies between the webs weaved by the spiders in the two groups. As anomalies are directly linked to behaviour during web construction (Foelix 2011), we could expect that the number of anomalies would increase for the spiders reared in boxes, but this was not the case. These results are in agreement with the previous study by Sensenig et al. (2010) that found that the general design of the web structure was not affected when webs were built under natural conditions (fence) or in the laboratory. Anomalies have not been extensively studied for orb-webs; they were rather unevaluated in experiments where spiders were put in extreme conditions such as weightlessness (Witt et al. 1968), drugs (Witt and Reed 1965; Hesselberg and Vollrath 2004), feeding (Blamires 2010) and ageing (Anotaux et al. 2012). Anomalies are difficult to use as parameter as they are numerous and varied (Pasquet et al. 2013). This phenomenon is also very difficult to study under natural conditions: after construction, the geometrical design of an orb-web is never perfect in the field. As soon as a web is made, or even during construction, the structure may be damaged by external events (wind, insects, vegetal). Indeed, under these conditions, {{it is difficult to determine}} whether an anomaly is the consequence of behavioural variation or due to external events. Previously, we showed that under laboratory conditions, anomalies in the orb structure are due to spider behavioural sequences during the <b>capture</b> <b>spiral</b> construction (Toscani et al. 2012). However, in this present study, experience had no influence on the number of anomalies made during web construction. We can therefore conclude that the behavioural scheme for web building is not affected by experience.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Combining high {{strength}} and elasticity, spider silks are exceptionally tough, i. e., able to absorb massive kinetic energy before breaking. Spider silk {{is therefore a}} model polymer for development of high performance biomimetic fibers. There are over 41, 000 described species of spiders, most spinning multiple types of silk. Thus we have available some 200, 000 + unique silks that may cover an amazing breadth of material properties. To date, however, silks from only a few tens of species have been characterized, most chosen haphazardly as model organisms (Nephila) or simply from researchers' backyards. Are we limited to 'blindly fishing' in efforts to discover extraordinary silks? Or, could scientists use ecology to predict which species are likely to spin silks exhibiting exceptional performance properties? METHODOLOGY: We examined the biomechanical properties of silk produced by the remarkable Malagasy 'Darwin's bark spider' (Caerostris darwini), which we predicted would produce exceptional silk based upon its amazing web. The spider constructs its giant orb web (up to 2. 8 m(2)) suspended above streams, rivers, and lakes. It attaches the web to substrates on each riverbank by anchor threads as long as 25 meters. Dragline silk from both Caerostris webs and forcibly pulled silk, exhibits an extraordinary combination of high tensile strength and elasticity previously unknown for spider silk. The toughness of forcibly silked fibers averages 350 MJ/m(3), with some samples reaching 520 MJ/m(3). Thus, C. darwini silk {{is more than twice}} tougher than any previously described silk, and over 10 times better than Kevlar®. Caerostris <b>capture</b> <b>spiral</b> silk is similarly exceptionally tough. CONCLUSIONS: Caerostris darwini produces the toughest known biomaterial. We hypothesize that this extraordinary toughness coevolved with the unusual ecology and web architecture of these spiders, decreasing the likelihood of bridgelines breaking and collapsing the web into the river. This hypothesis predicts that rapid change in material properties of silk co-occurred with ecological shifts within the genus, and can thus be tested by combining material science, behavioral observations, and phylogenetics. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of natural history-informed bioprospecting to discover silks, as well as other materials, with novel and exceptional properties to serve as models in biomimicry...|$|E

We hypothesize that this extraordinary toughness coevolved with the unusual ecology and web architecture of these spiders, decreasing the likelihood of bridgelines breaking and collapsing the web into the river. This hypothesis predicts that rapid change in material properties of silk co-occurred with ecological shifts within the genus, and can thus be tested by combining material science, behavioral observations, and phylogenetics. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of natural history–informed bioprospecting to discover silks, as well as other materials, with novel and exceptional properties to serve as models in biomimicry.

40|$|The defect {{containment}} {{measure is}} traditionally {{used to provide}} insight into project success (or lack thereof) at capturing defects early in the project life cycle, i. e., the time when defect repair costs are at their minimum. Although the measure does {{provide insight into the}} effectiveness of early defect capture techniques (such as peer reviews), defect containment in its most common form (percentage of defects captured) is a lagging indicator as its ultimate value cannot be known until a project is complete. At that point, it is too late for a project to take corrective action. Using raw defect containment data and deriving Quantitative Defect Management (QDM) measures early in the development life cycle provides opportunities for a project to identify issues in defect <b>capture</b> before costs <b>spiral</b> out of control, schedule delays ensue, and another Death March begins [1]. Software quality issues have become a sad cliché in the software engineering industry. Versions 1. 0 of commercial software products are notoriously defect-ridden. Furthermore, mission critical software has exhibited spectacular disasters, such as the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter when English units were used i...|$|R
500|$|It {{consists}} of two spirals: one principal and one ancillary. The latter left-hand <b>spiral</b> <b>captured</b> both spring and fall equinoxes; its artifice was revealed by a descending spear of light, itself filtered through the slabs, that shined upon it and split it in two. The former and larger whorl to its right was lit by the titular [...] "sun dagger", which bisected it through another interplay of slab and sun. It struck it, brilliantly, as the summer sun attains its solstice midday peak. The Chacoans {{were said to be}} marking, as artist, [...] "Sun Dagger" [...] discoverer, and leading proponent Anna Sofaer puts it, [...] "the middle of time". Each turn of the 9.25-turn large spiral was found to mark one year in the 18.6-year [...] "lunar excursion cycle" [...] of the rising mid-winter full moon. This record is kept by a slab-cast lunar shadow whose edge strikes in succession each ring. As the full [...] "minimum moon" [...] closest to the winter solstice rises, the shadow's edge precisely strikes the center of the larger spiral; it steps outward year by year, ring by ring, until it strikes the outermost edge of it during the full [...] "maximum moon", again in mid-winter.|$|R
40|$|Pre-clinical {{markers of}} Parkinson's Disease (PD) are needed, {{and to be}} {{relevant}} in pre-clinical disease, they should be quantifiably abnormal in early disease as well. Handwriting is impaired early in PD and can be evaluated using computerized analysis of drawn <b>spirals,</b> <b>capturing</b> kinematic, dynamic, and spatial abnormalities and calculating indices that quantify motor performance and disability. Digitized spiral drawing correlates with motor scores and may be more sensitive in detecting early changes than subjective ratings. However, whether changes in spiral drawing are abnormal compared with controls and whether changes are detected in early PD are unknown. 138 PD subjects (50 with early PD) and 150 controls drew spirals on a digitizing tablet, generating x, y, z (pressure) data-coordinates and time. Derived indices corresponded to overall spiral execution (severity), shape and kinematic irregularity (second order smoothness, first order zero-crossing), tightness, mean speed and variability of spiral width. Linear mixed effect adjusted models comparing these indices and cross-validation were performed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was applied to examine discriminative validity of combined indices. All indices were significantly different between PD cases and controls, except for zero-crossing. A model using all indices had high discriminative validity (sensitivity = 0. 86, specificity = 0. 81). Discriminative validity was maintained in patients with early PD. Spiral analysis accurately discriminates subjects with PD and early PD from controls supporting a role as a promising quantitative biomarker. Further assessment {{is needed to determine}} whether spiral changes are PD specific compared with other disorders and if present in pre-clinical PD...|$|R
