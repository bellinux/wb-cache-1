5|$|Lincoln's bodyguard, John Parker, left Ford's Theater during {{intermission}} {{to drink}} at the saloon next door. The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony. Seizing the opportunity, Booth <b>crept</b> up from behind and at about 10:13pm, aimed {{at the back of}} Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.|$|E
5|$|In 226 BC, the {{citizens}} of Mantinea appealed to Cleomenes to expel the Achaeans from the city. One night, he and his troops <b>crept</b> into the citadel and removed the Achaean garrison. The king reinstated the ancient laws {{of the city and}} returned to Tegea. From Tegea, the Spartans advanced into Achaea, where Cleomenes hoped to force the League to face him in a pitched battle. Cleomenes advanced with his army to Dyme, where he was met by the entire Achaean army. In the Battle of Dyme, the Spartans routed the Achaean phalanx, killing many of the Achaeans and capturing others. Following this victory, Cleomenes captured the city of Lasium and presented it to the Elians.|$|E
5|$|In town, Creger {{watched as}} a forward element of the German {{infantry}} advanced, with weapons slung, into Lanzerath. They obviously {{did not expect to}} encounter any Americans. Creger radioed Bouck and told him of the Germans advancing through Lanzerath on the road between Creger and Bouck's position. Bouck sent Robinson, McGeehee and Silvola to assist Creger, who <b>crept</b> down to the Bucholz Station road and thence up a ditch towards Lanzerath. Before the three men reached Creger, he left the village using a more direct route. As he returned to the American lines, he engaged and killed or wounded most of a German platoon.|$|E
5|$|On 10 April 1918, at El Kefr, Egypt, {{during an}} attack, Rifleman Karanbahadur Rana {{and a few}} other men <b>crept</b> forward with a Lewis gun under intense fire to engage an enemy machine-gun. No. 1 of the Lewis gun team opened fire but was shot almost immediately, whereupon the rifleman pushed the dead man off the gun, opened fire, knocked out the enemy gun crew and then silenced the fire of the enemy bombers and riflemen in front of him. During the {{remainder}} of the day he did magnificent work and finally assisted with covering fire in the withdrawal, until the enemy were close on him.|$|E
5|$|Records {{state that}} plague deaths in London and the suburbs <b>crept</b> {{up over the}} summer from 2,000 people per week to over 7,000 per week in September. These figures {{are likely to be}} a {{considerable}} underestimate. Many of the sextons and parish clerks who kept the records themselves died. Quakers refused to co-operate and many of the poor were just dumped into mass graves unrecorded. It is not clear how many people caught the disease and made a recovery because only deaths were recorded and many records were destroyed in the Great Fire of London the following year. In the few districts where intact records remain, plague deaths varied between 30% and over 50% of the total population.|$|E
5|$|William Brereton. The {{walls were}} {{repaired}} and the motte was cleaned out. During 1643 {{part of the}} royal army of Ireland landed at Chester. On 13 December 1643 Captain Thomas Sandford and eight soldiers from that army <b>crept</b> into Beeston at night (possibly aided by treachery) and surprised the castle governor, Captain Thomas Steele, who was so shaken by the event that he surrendered on the promise {{that he would be}} allowed to march out of the castle with honours. Steele was tried and shot for his failure to hold the castle.|$|E
5|$|Chambers and {{his second}} in command, Captain Charles Spragg, {{immediately}} set about constructing a defensive trench across the post, and strengthening its other defences. But by now the Turks, from the 72nd Infantry Regiment, about 1,000-strong, had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position. At 22:00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded, and at 23:35 the telephone line to headquarters was cut by the Turks. The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully {{and out of sight}} to the defenders, so they had to climb on the trench parapet to engage the Turks. This tactic worked well, and they broke up the Turkish assault, causing the attackers some casualties. The Turks did not withdraw far, and <b>crept</b> up {{to the edge of the}} New Zealanders' trench during the night. They then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders' position. At the same time, small arms fire from the surrounding Turkish positions pinned the New Zealanders down.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October 1943, the 14-ton vacuum tanks <b>crept</b> out of alignment because {{of the power of the}} magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{also suffered}} from financial problems, and Asif exceeded the budget {{on a number}} of occasions. The final budget of the film is a subject of debate. Some sources state that Mughal-e-Azam cost 10.5 million to produce (about US$2 million at the time), while others claim that it cost 15million, about $3 million. This made Mughal-e-Azam the most expensive Indian film of the period. A number of estimates put the film's inflation-adjusted budget at 500 million to 2billion. The budget situation strained the relationship between Asif and Pallonji, while the production also faced troubled relationships among other crew members; differences <b>crept</b> up between Asif and Kumar when the former married the latter's sister. Another source of trouble was the romantic relationship and ultimate break-up of Kumar and Madhubala, who had been dating for nine years.|$|E
5|$|The {{skirmish}} {{became a}} full-scale battle by 4:00p.m. After the Americans drove Captain Pipe's Delawares {{out of the}} woods and onto to prairie, the Delawares were reinforced by Dunquat's Wyandots. Elliott also arrived on the scene and coordinated the actions of the Delawares and the Wyandots. Pipe's Delawares skillfully outflanked the American position and then attacked their rear. A few Indians <b>crept</b> close to the American lines in the tall prairie grass. The Americans responded by climbing trees to get a better shot at them. Gunsmoke filled the air, making it difficult to see. After {{three and a half hours}} of incessant firing, the Indians gradually broke off the attack with the approach of nightfall. Both sides slept with arms at the ready, and surrounded their positions with large fires to prevent surprise night attacks.|$|E
5|$|To keep enemy {{action to}} a minimum during the assault, a {{creeping}} barrage was planned. This required gunners to create a curtain of high explosive and shrapnel shell explosions that <b>crept</b> across the battlefield in lines, about one hundred metres {{in advance of the}} assaulting troops. The Allies had previously used creeping barrages at the battles of Neuve Chapelle and the Somme but had encountered two technical problems. The first was accurately synchronising the movement of the troops to the fall of the barrage: for Arras, this was overcome by rehearsal and strict scheduling. The second was the barrage falling erratically as the barrels of heavy guns wore swiftly but at differing rates during fire: for Arras, the rate of wear of each gun barrel was calculated and calibrated accordingly. While there was a risk of friendly fire, the creeping barrage forced the Germans to remain in their shelters, allowing Allied soldiers to advance without fear of machine gun fire. The new instantaneous No. 106 Fuze had been adapted from a French design for high-explosive shells so that they detonated on the slightest impact, vaporising barbed wire. Poison gas shells were used for the final minutes of the barrage.|$|E
5|$|Warwick's army heavily outnumbered Edward's, {{although}} sources {{differ on}} exact numbers. Lancastrian strength ranges from 10,000–30,000 men, with 7,000–15,000 on the Yorkist side. Facing this disadvantage, Edward hurried {{to meet the}} Lancastrians with a surprise attack. He brought Henry VI along to prevent the Lancastrians from retaking their king. Edward reached Barnet in the evening, and without knowing the precise location of his foes, prepared the battle line. The Yorkist king deployed Hastings {{on the left and}} entrusted Gloucester to lead the right flank. Clarence would fight alongside Edward in the centre, although this was not due to faith in his ability—it was easier for the Yorkists {{to keep an eye on}} their twice-defected prince there. A contingent of reserves was kept at the rear, ready to deploy at Edward's call. As night fell, Edward put his plan for surprise morning attack in motion. Under a strict order of silence, the Yorkist army <b>crept</b> closer to the Lancastrians. During the night, neither commander spotted the opposing army, an event that proved crucial in the battle the next day.|$|E
5|$|When {{the plant}} was started up for testing on {{schedule}} in November, the 14-ton vacuum tanks <b>crept</b> out of alignment because {{of the power of}} the magnets and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December, Groves ordered a magnet broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings. The second Alpha I was not operational until the end of January 1944; the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I became operational in April. The four Alpha II racetracks were completed between July and October 1944.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ground}} {{hardening}} {{due to the}} cold weather, The Germans resumed the attack on Moscow on 15 November. Although the troops themselves were now able to advance again, {{there had been no}} improvement in the supply situation. Facing the Germans were the 5th, 16th, 30th, 43rd, 49th, and 50th Soviet Armies. The Germans intended to move the 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies across the Moscow Canal and envelop Moscow from the northeast. The 2nd Panzer Group would attack Tula and then close on Moscow from the south. As the Soviets reacted to their flanks, the 4th Army would attack the center. In two weeks of fighting, lacking sufficient fuel and ammunition, the Germans slowly <b>crept</b> towards Moscow. In the south, the 2nd Panzer Group was being blocked. On 22 November, Soviet Siberian units, augmented by the 49th and 50th Soviet Armies, attacked the 2nd Panzer Group and inflicted a defeat on the Germans. The 4th Panzer Group pushed the Soviet 16th Army back, however, and succeeded in crossing the Moscow Canal in an attempt to encircle Moscow.|$|E
5|$|The German team {{started the}} second half in a more {{positive}} mood with Jancker forcing a save from Schmeichel in the first minute of the restart. Basler was proving to be Bayern's most dangerous player, first firing a 30-yard shot towards goal and then setting up a header for Markus Babbel, who missed the ball entirely. United put together an attack when, after a healthy period of possession, Giggs sent in a cross towards Jesper Blomqvist who could only knock the ball over the bar after a desperate stretch. Another chance for Basler prompted Alex Ferguson to bring on striker Teddy Sheringham. Ottmar Hitzfeld responded with a substitution of his own, bringing on Mehmet Scholl, who immediately set up Stefan Effenberg for a long-range shot which went narrowly wide. Schmeichel kept his side in the game when tipping another Effenberg shot over the bar after 75 minutes. Scholl then almost scored from a delicate 20-yard chip after a run from Basler, but the ball bounced back off the post and {{into the arms of}} a relieved Schmeichel. With the game seemingly drifting away from the English side, Ferguson introduced striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær with 10 minutes remaining. The substitute immediately forced Kahn into a diving save with a header; it was the closest United had come to scoring all game. A minute later, Bayern missed a chance to secure the trophy when an overhead kick from Jancker came off the crossbar. As the game <b>crept</b> into the last five minutes, United's two substitutes forced Kahn into more saves, firstly through a Sheringham volley and then from another Solskjær header.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 1900, {{during the}} British march on Pretoria, Burnham was wounded, almost fatally. He {{was on a}} mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and {{supplies}} to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of the Pretoria. He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body. It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then <b>crept</b> {{on his hands and knees}} to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him. Once in Pretoria the surgeons discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood-vessel. His very survival was due only to the fact that he had been without food or water for three days.|$|E
25|$|On 19 October, the PSI <b>crept</b> {{into the}} {{unhealthy}} range at 106 at 2p.m., peaking at 113 at 4p.m. The National Environment Agency {{reported that the}} situation would not improve the next day.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{predicts that}} {{nearly a quarter}} of Victorians will be aged over 60 by 2021. The 2011 census reveals that Australian median age has <b>crept</b> upward from 35 to 37 since 2001, which reflects the population growth peak of 1969–72.|$|E
25|$|These {{notes were}} added because the Masoretes {{recognized}} {{the possibility of}} human error in copying the Hebrew Bible. The Masoretes were not working with the original Hebrew manuscripts of the Bible and corruptions had already <b>crept</b> into the versions they copied.|$|E
25|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{with the ability}} of {{scientists}} to isolate and culture embryonic stem cells, and with scientists' growing ability to create stem cells using somatic cell nuclear transfer and techniques to create induced pluripotent stem cells, controversy has <b>crept</b> in, both related to abortion politics and to human cloning.|$|E
25|$|Kolkata {{was also}} the {{workplace}} of several social reformers, like Raja Ram Mohan Ray, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Swami Vivekananda. These social reforms have eventually led to a cultural atmosphere where practices like sati, dowry, and caste-based discrimination or untouchability, the evils that <b>crept</b> into the Hindu society, were abolished.|$|E
25|$|Communists, red sympathizers {{and their}} {{families}} are being massacred by the thousands. Backlands army units are reported to have executed thousands of communists after interrogation in remote jails. Armed with wide-bladed knives called parangs, Moslem bands <b>crept</b> at night into the homes of communists, killing entire families and burying their bodies in shallow graves.|$|E
25|$|Swedes {{celebrate}} Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday, Fettisdagen) 41 {{days before}} Easter (rather Palm Sunday, since the fasting was forty days, Ash Wednesday {{to the day}} before Easter Saturday, Sundays not included). This is celebrated by eating a special pastry called semla. Lent is honoured by a minority of Swedes. The annual première of semla-eating has <b>crept</b> {{all the way to}} early January.|$|E
25|$|The county {{includes}} {{parts of}} two of the four longest rivers in England. The River Thames forms the southern boundary with Berkshire, which has <b>crept</b> over the border at Eton and Slough so that the river is no longer the sole boundary between the two counties. The River Great Ouse rises just outside the county in Northamptonshire and flows east through Buckingham, Milton Keynes and Olney.|$|E
25|$|As of January 11, 2011, over 100 {{donations}} {{inspired by}} Tiger Mask {{have been reported}} across Japan. After the two initial donations, many other orphanages and children's facilities began to receive copycat donations of backpacks.

In addition, parallels to other anime and manga concerning orphaned children have also <b>crept</b> into the donation phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|While the {{influence}} of Scandinavian language was strongest in dialects in the Danelaw region and Scotland, the spoken words <b>crept</b> into the language in the tenth and eleventh centuries near {{the transition from the}} Old to Middle English period, but such borrowed words only appeared in the Middle English writing {{at the beginning of the}} thirteenth century, likely because of a scarcity of literary texts from an earlier date.|$|E
25|$|The current Hullabahoos logo {{was drawn}} in fall 2003 by Morgan Anderson, {{a student at}} Williams College, to promote the Hullabahoos' visit to her college.

25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Chicago <b>crept</b> closer with kicker Robbie Gould {{converting}} a 44-yard field goal. Green Bay responded with Crosby kicking a 37-yard field goal, yet the Bears pulled to within three as QB Brian Griese completed a 19-yard TD pass to TE Greg Olsen. In the fourth quarter, Chicago erased their deficit completely with Gould's 36-yard field goal and Griese's 34-yard TD pass to TE Desmond Clark.|$|E
25|$|The Orcs and Dunlendings {{then raised}} {{hundreds}} of ladders to scale the wall. Aragorn and Éomer repeatedly motivated the tired defenders to repel the Orcs {{coming up the}} ladders. However, some Orcs had <b>crept</b> in through a culvert which let a stream out of Helm's Deep, and while the defenders were busy with {{the assault on the}} wall, they were suddenly attacked from behind. This was repulsed and the culvert was blocked up under Gimli's supervision.|$|E
25|$|In late 1975 and 1976, {{the newly}} hired sales manager Stewart Halstead {{was charged with}} the task of {{expanding}} the home and European markets to stabilize TVR's future. Enthusiasm for the cars was high in the US, tempered {{by the fact that the}} cars' pricing had <b>crept</b> up over recent years to the point where the same money could buy a new Corvette.

25|$|After coastal {{operations}} off Vietnam from 27 March to 5 May, Terrell County {{retired to}} Japan on one shaft, since her starboard shaft had ceased functioning. On 13 May, as she <b>crept</b> along toward Yokosuka, her lookouts sighted the Soviet merchant ship Makhachala two points abaft the starboard beam and closing. Both ships continued steady on their courses, as Terrell County {{assumed that the}} heavily laden Soviet ship would stay clear. Finally, both ships were forced to maneuver radically to avert a collision.|$|E
25|$|Tennessee {{lacked the}} speed needed to ram the Union vessels as they passed, {{allowing}} Farragut to order {{some of his}} small, faster gunboats to attack the three Confederate gunboats. Metacomet, unleashed from Hartford, captured Selma. Fire from the gunboats holed Gaines, {{and she would have}} sunk had she not been beached; she was then burned by her crew. Morgan put up no resistance, but fled to the protection of the guns of Fort Morgan; next night she <b>crept</b> through the anchored Union fleet and escaped to Mobile.|$|E
25|$|Turkey has a {{moderate}} level of female unemployment {{relative to other}} Muslim countries. In 2008, 11.6% of women were unemployed. By 2010, this number <b>crept</b> up to 13.0%. However, long-term employment is {{a significant portion of}} female unemployment. In 2010, according to World Bank statistics, 37% of all unemployed women were long-run unemployed workers, or workers who have been out of work for more than one year. Very little data exists on the long-term unemployment rates of women for most nations and for Middle Eastern nations in particular.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of Highway 99 {{and the opening}} of the Deas Island Tunnel (now the George Massey Tunnel) created a second boom for the White Rock area, providing a more convenient commuter route to Vancouver. No longer dependent upon the railway, development <b>crept</b> up the hillside. In the 1980s, the City of Surrey designated South Surrey as a town centre comparable to Guildford, Cloverdale, and Newton. The Semiahmoo Mall opened in Surrey {{on the north side of}} 16 Avenue (the south side of which is North Bluff Road within White Rock).|$|E
25|$|In his autobiography, Harpo {{explained}} that Milton became Gummo because he <b>crept</b> about the theater like a gumshoe detective. Other sources reported that Gummo was the family's hypochondriac, having been the sickliest {{of the brothers}} in childhood, and therefore wore rubber overshoes, called gumshoes, {{in all kinds of}} weather. Still others reported that Milton was the troupe's best dancer, and dance shoes tended to have rubber soles. Groucho stated that the source of the name was Gummo wearing galoshes. Whatever the details, the name relates to rubber-soled shoes.|$|E
