5|$|Cancer {{develops}} following {{genetic damage}} to DNA and epigenetic changes. These changes affect the normal {{functions of the}} cell, including cell proliferation, programmed <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> (apoptosis) and DNA repair. As more damage accumulates, the risk of cancer increases.|$|E
5|$|During its lifetime, {{a nucleus}} may {{be broken down}} or destroyed, either {{in the process of}} cell {{division}} or as a consequence of apoptosis (the process of programmed <b>cell</b> <b>death).</b> During these events, the structural components of the nucleus — the envelope and lamina — can be systematically degraded.|$|E
5|$|Each monomer of the serpin {{aggregate}} {{exists in}} the inactive, relaxed conformation (with the RCL inserted into the A-sheet). The polymers are therefore hyperstable to temperature and unable to inhibit proteases. Serpinopathies therefore cause pathologies similarly to other proteopathies (e.g. prion diseases) via two main mechanisms. First, the lack of active serpin results in uncontrolled protease activity and tissue destruction. Second, the hyperstable polymers themselves clog up the endoplasmic reticulum of cells that synthesize serpins, eventually resulting in <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> and tissue damage. In the case of antitrypsin deficiency, antitrypsin polymers cause the death of liver cells, sometimes resulting in liver damage and cirrhosis. Within the cell, serpin polymers are slowly removed via degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, {{the details of how}} serpin polymers cause <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> remains to be fully understood.|$|E

40|$|In women, oocytes arrest {{development}} {{at the end of}} prophase of meiosis I and remain quiescent for years. Over time, {{the quality and quantity of}} these oocytes decreases, resulting in fewer pregnancies and an increased occurrence of birth defects. We used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to study how oocyte quality is regulated during aging. To assay quality, we determine the fraction of oocytes that produce viable eggs after fertilization. Our results show that oocyte quality declines in aging nematodes, as in humans. This decline affects oocytes arrested in late prophase, waiting for a signal to mature, and also oocytes that develop later in life. Furthermore, mutations that block all <b>cell</b> <b>deaths</b> result in a severe, early decline in oocyte quality, and this effect increases with age. However, mutations that block only somatic <b>cell</b> <b>deaths</b> or DNA-damage–induced deaths do not lower oocyte quality. Two lines of evidence imply that most developmentally programmed germ <b>cell</b> <b>deaths</b> promote the proper allocation of resources among oocytes, rather than eliminate oocytes with damaged chromosomes. First, oocyte quality is lowered by mutations that do not prevent germ <b>cell</b> <b>deaths</b> but do block the engulfment and recycling of cell corpses. Second, the decrease in quality caused by apoptosis mutants is mirrored by a decrease in the size of many mature oocytes. We conclude that competition for resources is a serious problem in agin...|$|R

5|$|Prion {{aggregates}} {{are extremely}} stable and accumulate in infected tissue, causing tissue damage and <b>cell</b> <b>death.</b> This structural stability means that prions {{are resistant to}} denaturation by chemical and physical agents, making disposal and containment of these particles difficult. Prion structure varies slightly between species, but nonetheless prion replication is subject to epimutation and natural selection just like other forms of replication.|$|E
5|$|Several {{pathways}} {{by which}} mHTT may cause <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> have been identified. These include: effects on chaperone proteins, which help fold proteins and remove misfolded ones; interactions with caspases, which {{play a role}} in the process of removing cells; the toxic effects of glutamine on nerve cells; impairment of energy production within cells; and effects on the expression of genes.|$|E
5|$|Squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} {{accounts for}} about 30% of lung cancers. They typically occur close to large airways. A hollow cavity and associated <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> are commonly found {{at the center of}} the tumor. About 9% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinoma. These are so named because the cancer cells are large, with excess cytoplasm, large nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli.|$|E

5|$|Various Cyathus {{species have}} {{antifungal}} activity against human pathogens such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Extracts of C.striatus have inhibitory effects on NF-κB, a transcription factor responsible for regulating {{the expression of}} several genes involved in the immune system, inflammation, and <b>cell</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to protein- and solution-mediated processes, {{it is also}} possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling. A classic example of this is phosphatidylserine-triggered phagocytosis. Normally, phosphatidylserine is asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane and is present only on the interior side. During programmed <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> a protein called a scramblase equilibrates this distribution, displaying phosphatidylserine on the extracellular bilayer face. The presence of phosphatidylserine then triggers phagocytosis to remove the dead or dying cell.|$|E
5|$|Other {{immunotherapy}} treatments {{interfere with}} the binding of programmed <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> 1 (PD-1) protein with its ligand PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). Signaling through PD-1 inactivates T cells. Some cancer cells appear to exploit this by expressing PD-L1 in order to switch off T cells that might recognise them as a threat. Monoclonal antibodies targeting both PD-1 and PD-L1, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab are currently in clinical trials for treatment for lung cancer.|$|E
50|$|Clotrimazole {{works to}} kill {{individual}} Candida or fungal cells by altering the permeability of the fungal cell wall. It binds to phospholipids {{in the cell}} membrane and inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol and other sterols required for cell membrane production. This leads to the <b>cell's</b> <b>death</b> via loss of intracellular elements.|$|R
50|$|It acts by irreversibly binding the S12 {{protein in}} the {{bacterial}} 30S ribosomal subunit, after being actively transported across the cell membrane, which {{interferes with the}} initiation complex between the mRNA and the bacterial ribosome. This leads to the synthesis of defective non-functional proteins, which results in the bacterial <b>cell's</b> <b>death.</b>|$|R

5|$|The amyloid {{hypothesis}} traditionally {{points to}} the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides as the central event triggering neuron degeneration. Accumulation of aggregated amyloid fibrils, which {{are believed to be}} the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion homeostasis, induces programmed <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> (apoptosis). It is also known that Aβ selectively builds up in the mitochondria in the cells of Alzheimer's-affected brains, and it also inhibits certain enzyme functions and the utilisation of glucose by neurons.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} Chagas disease {{are due to}} <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by sequentially inducing an inflammatory response, cellular lesions, and fibrosis. For example, intracellular amastigotes destroy the intramural neurons of the autonomic nervous system in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart aneurysms, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas disease can be fatal, in most cases due to heart muscle damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} {{structural}} and biochemical effects that viruses {{have on the}} host cell is extensive. These are called cytopathic effects. Most virus infections eventually result {{in the death of}} the host cell. The causes of death include cell lysis, alterations to the cell's surface membrane and apoptosis. Often <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> is caused by cessation of its normal activities because of suppression by virus-specific proteins, not all of which are components of the virus particle.|$|E

25|$|Necroptosis is a {{programmed}} form of necrosis, or inflammatory <b>cell</b> <b>death.</b> Conventionally, necrosis {{is associated}} with unprogrammed <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> resulting from cellular damage or infiltration by pathogens, in contrast to orderly, programmed <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> via apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Other {{forms of}} {{programmed}} <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> include anoikis, {{almost identical to}} apoptosis except in its induction; cornification, a form of <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> exclusive to the eyes; excitotoxicity; ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> and Wallerian degeneration.|$|E

40|$|All {{forms of}} life are confronted with {{environmental}} and genetic perturbations, making phenotypic robustness an important characteristic of life. Although development has long been viewed as {{a key component of}} phenotypic robustness, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we report that the determinative developmental cell lineages of two protostomes and one deuterostome are structured such that the resulting cellular compositions of the organisms are only modestly affected by <b>cell</b> <b>deaths.</b> Several features of the cell lineages, including their shallowness, topology, early ontogenic appearances of rare cells, and non-clonality of most cell types, underlie the robustness. Simple simulations of cell lineage evolution demonstrate the possibility that the observed robustness arose as an adaptation in the face of random <b>cell</b> <b>deaths</b> in development. These results reveal general organizing principles of determinative developmental cell lineages and a conceptually new mechanism of phenotypic robustness, both of which have important implications for development and evolution...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: For tumor {{development}} and progression, angiogenesis and apoptosis {{play a crucial}} role. No study so far has tried to associate these two activities in tumor cells as well as correlation of both activities in the tumor and the endothelial cells. Conclusion: This study supports the role of endothelial cells in survival and regression of tumor cells in tumoregenesis. Thus, the inhibition of endothelial cells survival factor or activation ofendothelial <b>cells</b> <b>death</b> is a promising prospect {{as a candidate for}} tumor therapy. All the proteins used in this study might be potential as a useful marker for diagnosis of specific histologic subtypes especially Bcl- 2 since there is diversity in expression amongst the various histologic subtypes in STS. An increase in angiogenic activity may inhibit apoptotic tumor <b>cells</b> <b>death</b> which leads to cell proliferation. However, the angiogenic activity was independent of anti-­‐apoptotic activities. A better understanding of their relations probably provides the basis for more rational cancer therapies in the future...|$|R
25|$|The role {{of these}} enzymes in {{programmed}} <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> was first identified in 1993, with their functions in apoptosis well characterised. This {{is a form}} of programmed <b>cell</b> <b>death,</b> occurring widely during development, and throughout life to maintain cell homeostasis. Activation of Caspases ensures that the cellular components are degraded in a controlled manner, carrying out <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> with minimal effect on surrounding tissues.|$|E
25|$|It has {{roles in}} {{progression}} of the cell cycle, including <b>cell</b> <b>death.</b> GSH levels regulate redox changes to nuclear proteins necessary for the initiation of cell differentiation. Differences in GSH levels also determine the expressed mode of <b>cell</b> <b>death,</b> being either apoptosis or cell necrosis. Manageably low levels result in the systematic breakage of the cell whereas excessively low levels result in rapid <b>cell</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pyroptosis {{is a form}} of {{programmed}} <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> that inherently induces {{an immune}} response. It is morphologically distinct from other types of <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> – cells swell up, rupture and release pro-inflammatory cellular contents. This is done in response to a range of stimuli including microbial infections as well as heart attacks (myocardial infarctions). Caspase-1, Caspase-4 and Caspase-5 in humans, and Caspase-1 and Caspase-11 in mice play important roles in inducing <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> by Pyroptosis. This limits the life and proliferation time of intracellular and extracellular pathogens.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe classic Luria-Delbrück {{model for}} {{fluctuation}} analysis is {{extended to the}} case where the split instant distributions of cells are not i. i. d. : the lifetime of each cell is assumed to depend on its birth date. This model takes also into account <b>cell</b> <b>deaths</b> and non exponentially distributed lifetimes. In particular, {{it is possible to}} consider subprobability distributions, and model non exponential growth. It leads to a family of probability distributions which depend on the expected number of mutations, the death probability of mutant cells, and the split instant distributions of normal and mutant cells. This is deduced from the Bellman-Harris integral equation, written for the birthdate inhomoge-neous case. A new theorem of convergence for the final mutant counts is proved, using an analytic method. Particular examples like the Haldane model, or the case where hazard functions of the split instant distributions are proportional are studied. The Luria-Delbrück distribution with <b>cell</b> <b>deaths</b> is recovered. A computation algorithm for the probabilities is provided...|$|R
