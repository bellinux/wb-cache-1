5|$|On May 1, 2004, a 53-year-old, 5' 2", 230lb (104.5kg) {{man from}} Bloomfield, Connecticut, {{fell out of}} his coaster seat during the last turn and was killed. Reports show that the ride {{attendant}} had not checked that the guest's ride restraint was secure as his girth was too large for the T-bar-shaped ride restraint to close properly. The victim's family said that due to his various medical conditions, such as cerebral palsy, he shouldn't {{have been allowed to}} ride. The park stated that the federal Americans with Disabilities Act forbids them from denying a ride to a person with a disability as long as the person <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the ride by themselves.|$|E

25|$|Abrahams {{is badly}} beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. He knows his last {{chance for a}} medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is {{overcome}} that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected {{for the sake of}} running. Before Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now far longer 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, Jackson Scholz, hands Liddell a note of support for his convictions. Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal.|$|E

500|$|At {{this point}} in her career, Beckinsale began to seek work in the United States, {{something}} she has said wasn't [...] "a conscious decision...My boyfriend was in a play on Broadway so that's why we ended up in New York, and my auditions happened to be for American films." [...] She starred opposite Chloë Sevigny in 1998's The Last Days of Disco. The Whit Stillman film focused {{on a group of}} Ivy League graduates socializing in the Manhattan disco scene of the early 1980s. Beckinsale's attempt at an American accent was widely praised. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt her role as the bossy Charlotte was [...] "beautifully played." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety was unimpressed by the film but noted that [...] "compensations include Beckinsale, looking incredible in a succession of black dresses, whose character <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> your nerves even if the actress doesn't." [...] Her performance earned her a London Critics' Circle Film Award. The film grossed $3million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Lim Choon Klet of New Straits Times {{praised the}} [...] "simply wonderful" [...] {{graphics}} but {{questioned whether the}} sound effects were enough to [...] "create the environment of a full-scale war". Choon Klet pointed to a high initial difficulty but said: [...] "Once the skills are acquired, be ready for many hours of enjoyment and sleepless nights." [...] Chip and Jonathan Carter of St. Petersburg Times deemed the game {{one of the best}} of the year and felt the SNES version [...] "loses nothing in the translation". The duo said the Game Boy and Game Gear versions were [...] "less impressive" [...] due to their technical restrictions but [...] "about as good as you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the small screen". [...] "Sir Garnabus" [...] of GamePro was impressed with the Game Boy version's clear and detailed graphics, lack of slowdown, good controls, and faithfulness to the original version, but judged the Game Gear version to be [...] "merely average", saying issues such as poor collision detection hamper the game despite its outstanding graphics. Amiga CD32 Gamer called Jungle Strike [...] "a 500lb gorilla among games" [...] and praised its ease of control and [...] "masses of gameplay and realistic detail".|$|E
500|$|... "Champion" [...] {{was written}} by Minaj, along with T-Minus, Nikhil S., Drake, Young Jeezy, and Nas, with {{production}} handled by T-Minus and Nikhil S., who had previously worked with Minaj on her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010). Minaj had wanted several artists {{to appear on the}} song, including fellow New York rapper Nas. She had stated that she did not think that she could get Nas on the song, saying [...] "He's always been so exclusive. He doesn't work with everybody and I respect people that are like that. They take pride in their craft." [...] Minaj told Vibe, [...] "I keep saying to be from Queens and to end up having him... We know how picky he is [...] He said 'I like the song, I'm a do it, you can wait 'til Monday and I got you' and he kept his word. He murked it, for me to wait for a feature and it be that and murk the song and finish the song that way... I was amazed." [...] After hearing the song, Nas agreed to be on the track, and sent his verse back to Minaj the following Monday. After collaborating, Nas said that he {{had fallen in love with}} the song: [...] "Nicki hit us up, I got love, so it was nothin'--I did the record....If I feel it, I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> it. I heard the track. I felt it. I loved it." [...] Another artist Minaj wanted on [...] "Champion" [...] was long-time idol and fellow female rapper Lauryn Hill. [...] "I wanted to get her on 'Champion'... That would have been crazy, right? She was my fave. [...] Lauryn to me is the goddess. I'd love to meet her. I'm pretty sure she's heard me talk about her a billion times." [...] Although Minaj vouched for Hill to appear on the track, plans were never finalized and the collaboration ultimately fell through.|$|E

2500|$|Of the 1996 Hastings Center Report, Emanuel said, [...] "I was {{examining}} two different, abstract philosophical {{positions to}} see what they might offer in the context of redoing the health-care system and trying to reduce resource consumption in health care. It's as abstractly philosophical as you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> a practical question. I qualified it in 27 different ways, saying it wasn't my view." [...] He also said, [...] "As far as rationing goes, it's nothing I've ever advocated for the health system as a whole, and I've talked about rationing only in the context of situations where you have limited items, like limited livers or limited vaccine, and not for overall health care." ...|$|E

2500|$|A blatant bigot, McReynolds {{would not}} accept [...] "Jews, drinkers, blacks, women, smokers, married or engaged individuals" [...] as law clerks. Time [...] "called him 'Puritanical', 'intolerably rude', 'savagely sarcastic', 'incredibly reactionary', and 'anti-Semitic'". McReynolds refused to speak to Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish member of the Court, for three years {{following}} Brandeis's appointment and, when Brandeis retired in 1939, did not sign the customary dedicatory letter sent to justices on their retirement. He habitually left the conference room whenever Brandeis spoke. When Benjamin Cardozo's appointment was being pressed on President Herbert C. Hoover, McReynolds joined with fellow justices Pierce Butler and Willis Van Devanter in urging the White House not to [...] "afflict the Court with another Jew". When news of Cardozo's appointment was announced, McReynolds is claimed to have said [...] "Huh, {{it seems that the}} only way you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the Supreme Court these days is to be either the son of a criminal or a Jew, or both." [...] During Cardozo's swearing-in ceremony, McReynolds pointedly read a newspaper, and would often hold a brief or record {{in front of his face}} when Cardozo delivered an opinion from the bench. Likewise, he refused to sign opinions authored by Brandeis.|$|E
