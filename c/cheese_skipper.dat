25|$|Cheese flies – Family Piophilidae - Most are {{scavengers}} {{in animal}} products and fungi. The best-known {{member of the}} family is Piophila casei. It is a small fly, about four mm (1/6inch) long, found worldwide. This fly's larva infests cured meats, smoked fish, cheeses, and decaying animals and is sometimes called the <b>cheese</b> <b>skipper</b> for its leaping ability. Forensic entomology uses the presence of Piophila casei larvae to help estimate the date of death for human remains. They do not take up residence in a corpse until three to six months after death. The adult fly's body is black, blue-black, or bronze, with some yellow on the head, antennae, and legs. The wings are faintly iridescent and lie flat upon the fly's abdomen when at rest. At four mm (1/6inch) long, the fly is one-third to one-half as long as the common housefly.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most notorious}} {{member of the}} family is the cheese fly, Piophila casei; it is cosmopolitan, and a typical {{member of the family}}. It is a small species, about 4 mm long. The fly's larvae infest cured meats, smoked or salted fish, cheeses, and carrion. The mature larva is about 8 mm long and is {{sometimes}} called the <b>cheese</b> <b>skipper</b> because of its leaping ability - when disturbed, this tiny maggot can hop some 15 cm (6 in) into the air. Adults are also known as bacon flies and their larvae as bacon skippers, ham skippers, cheese maggots, cheese hoppers, etc. In the Mediterranean island of Sardinia, the larvae are intentionally introduced into pecorino cheese to produce the characteristic casu marzu ("rotten cheese" [...] in Sardinian).|$|E

40|$|Dry cured hams {{can become}} infested with ham mites (Tyrophagus putrescentiae), ham beetles (Necrobia rufipes), <b>cheese</b> <b>skippers</b> and dermestid beetles during aging.

50|$|The cheese fly (Piophila casei) is {{a species}} of fly known for infesting human foodstuffs. The larvae of this fly are known as <b>cheese</b> <b>skippers</b> due {{to their ability to}} launch {{themselves}} several inches into the air when alarmed. When consumed, the larvae can survive in the intestine, causing enteric myiasis.|$|R
5|$|The Sardinian cheese casu marzu {{is exposed}} to flies known as <b>cheese</b> <b>skippers</b> such as Piophila casei, {{members of the family}} Piophilidae. The {{digestive}} activities of the fly larvae soften the cheese and modify the aroma as {{part of the process of}} maturation. At one time European Union authorities banned sale of the cheese and it was becoming hard to find, but the ban has been lifted on the grounds that the cheese is a traditional local product made by traditional methods.|$|R
40|$|Two {{populations of}} the <b>cheese</b> <b>skipper,</b> Piophila casei (L.), were sampled. The 1 st was from a sheep farm where no {{chemical}} was ever applied; the 2 nd was present in a ham factory where chemical treatment with pyrethroids was applied in the past against house flies, Musca domestica L., and Dermestid beetles. A substantial difference between their resistance to deltamethrin was observed (LC(50) = 11. 56 versus 68. 08 mu g/cm(2) for females and 1. 11 versus 4. 20 mu g/cm(2) for males, respectively). Laboratory strains were established from both populations and were selected at constant rates for up to 20 generations (2, 4, and 7. 3 ppm for the strains derived from the 1 st population and 40 ppm for that selected from the 2 nd population). Males and females of both strains showed an increase in LC(50) (tested at the 5 th and 19 th or 10 th generation), except when females were selected at the lowest rate (2 ppm). At {{the end of the}} trial, slopes of logit regressions were substantially steeper in strains selected at higher rates, suggesting that the effect of the insecticide was to reduce resistance variance. Crosses between unselected and selected strains were done. Results of survival analysis in F- 1 hybrids were analogous for males and females and were similar in both reciprocal crosses. LC(50) s were intermediate between those of the parental strains...|$|E
5000|$|The Piophilidae are {{a family}} of [...] "true flies", in the order Diptera. The {{so-called}} cheese flies are the best-known members, but most species of the Piophilidae are scavengers in animal products, carrion, and fungi. They may accordingly be important in forensic entomology and medical entomology. For a fly maggot, the larvae of many species have an unusually well-developed ability to leap when alarmed or when abandoning their larval food to pupate; they accordingly may be known as <b>cheese</b> <b>skippers</b> or other kinds of skippers according to their food source.|$|R
40|$|Methyl bromide is {{commonly}} utilized as a fumigant {{in the dry}} curing of hams to prevent the infestation of ham beetles (Necrobia rufipes), <b>cheese</b> <b>skippers,</b> dermestid beetles, and ham mites(Tyrophagus putrescentiae) (EPA 2006). Although methyl bromide is the only known fumigant that is effective at preventing these arthropod infestations, it depletes the stratospheric ozone layer (Marriott and Schilling 2004). From audits and surveys performed by our research group, {{it was determined that}} there is somewhere between 60 and 100 dry cured ham processors, with 20 - 25 of these processors producing the majority of the product (Rentfrow et al. 2006). The request for the use of methyl bromide has been granted at 18, 000 - 20, 000 kg since the lack of availability of methyl bromide in dry cured ham processing would result in significant market disruption and this amount of methyl bromide currently meets the needs of the industry (EPA 2006). Very little research has been reported on the use of methyl bromide alternatives in the fumigation of dry cured pork, {{but one of the most}} promising alternatives t...|$|R
40|$|Dry cured hams {{often become}} infested with {{arthropod}} pests during the aging process, which include ham mites, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, red-legged ham beetles, Necrobia rufipes, <b>cheese</b> <b>skippers,</b> Piophila casei, and larder beetles, Dermestes lardarius. Methyl bromide {{has been used}} to fumigate dry cured ham plants and is the only known fumigant that is effective at eradiating ham mite infestations at this time (EPA, 2010). However, methyl bromide is classified as a Class 1 ozone depletion substance and will be phased out for all industries by 2015 (EPA, 2006). A survey of 34 dry cured ham indicated that 22 of plants surveyed used methyl bromide fumigation one to five times a year based on the severity of the infestation (Rentfrow, et al., 2008). It is crucial for the dry cured ham industry to discover and research potential alternatives to methyl bromide. Phosphine is considered to be the most widely used fumigant alternative for methyl bromide (Fields and White, 2002) due to its easy application, effectiveness, low cost and lack of residue (Zuryn et al., 2008). The density of phosphine is 1. 17 times that of air and it is a gas at above- 88 °C, which makes it disperse easily during fumigation (Nath et al., 2011). Phosphine works as a strong reducing agent in the mitochondrial electro...|$|R
