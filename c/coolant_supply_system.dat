40|$|The {{machining}} process 'grinding' is generally critically assessed concerning {{the amounts of}} heat produced during the process operation. Relatively high friction effects in abrasive machining cause heat generation {{which can lead to}} thermal damage in the surface layer of machined parts. Furthermore an inefficient cooling and lubrication system can result in higher tool wear and surface roughness. Therefore the application of cooling lubricants is of utmost importance in grinding. Usually the optimization of the <b>coolant</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> including the selection of the coolant itself is based only upon empirical know-how or practical trial-and-error-tests. Systematic approaches using broader experimental investigations and thus resulting optimized grinding parameters or using fluid mechanical investigations in the coolant supply nozzle or in the grinding gap are not or only rarely applied. This Dr. -Ing. dissertation presents three methods for the investigation and optimization of cooling lubrication in grinding of the ball bearing steel 100 Cr 6 : 1) modeling and process optimization using experimental data, 2) flow visualization in fluid supply nozzles and 3) grinding fluid pressure measurements in the contact zone...|$|E
40|$|All {{over the}} world, rocket engine design {{engineers}} {{are faced with}} an ever increasing demand for higher performance and reliability as well as reduced cost. In order to improve the efficiency of current state-of-the-art core engines, operating at combustion chamber pressures above 10 MPa, a hot gas pressure of up to 25 MPa is desirable. In consequence of the proportional increase of the heat transfer from the hot gas to the chamber wall at such high pressure levels, alternative cooling methods to the conventional regenerative cooling are proposed to ensure the thermal protection of the chamber liner. Effusion cooling of a porous combustion chamber wall made of carbon fiber reinforced carbon (C/C) {{seems to be one}} of the most prospective techniques to fulfill this requirement. Due to the high temperature resistance of this material, the demand of coolant fluid to protect the liner and therefore the pressure drop in the <b>coolant</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> is minimized. A constant improvement of the material characteristics and an optimization of the design of the combustion chamber wall with respect to the coolant distribution should lead to an acceptable coolant demand for a practical application of this technology. Following this approach, numerical analyses have been performed with the objective of a better understanding of the coolant flow dynamics inside the porous wall and the coolant - hot gas interaction at the wall outlet...|$|E

40|$|The {{results are}} given {{of the film}} cooling {{numerical}} simulation of three different schemes including single-array of the traditional round inclined holes, as well as inclined holes arranged in the cylindrical or triangular dimples (craters). The results of simulation showed that at the medium and high values of the blowing ratio (m > 1. 0) the scheme with <b>coolant</b> <b>supply</b> into triangular craters improves the adiabatic film cooling efficiency by 1. 5 … 2. 7 times compared to the traditional array of inclined holes, or by 1. 3 … 1. 8 times compared to the scheme with <b>coolant</b> <b>supply</b> into cylindrical craters. The greater film cooling efficiency with the <b>coolant</b> <b>supply</b> into triangular craters is explained by decrease in the intensity of secondary vortex structures (“kidney” vortex).

40|$|The use of high {{pressure}} <b>coolant</b> <b>supply</b> {{results in a}} significant reduction in the tool-chip contact length, and hence the contact area.

In this paper three different grinding wheels using the same nozzle parameters are compared with respect to their cooling efficiency and hence their impact on the surface {{integrity of}} the ground workpieces. Besides a standard grinding wheel with continuous layer, a slotted grinding wheel as well as a segmented grinding wheel are presented and their respective cooling efficiency is evaluated.

40|$|Single point {{continuous}} turning {{tests were}} carried out on Ti 6 Al 4 V and Inconel 901 using various geometries of straight grade (K 20) cemented carbide inserts using a high pressure coolant jet directed {{at the tip of}} the tool where the chip is formed. Trials were also carried out using a conventional <b>coolant</b> <b>supply</b> for comparison. The test results show that improved tool life can be achieved when machining the titanium-base alloy under the high pressure coolant jet while shorter tool life was obtained when machining the nickel-base alloy. The use of high pressure <b>coolant</b> <b>supply</b> during machining generally maintains constant cutting forces and reduces the chip-tool contact length, thus increasing stresses at the tool edge. This behavior tends to accelerate notching that is predominant when machining the Inconel 901 alloy, resulting in shorter tool life. This effect is not obvious when machining Ti 6 Al 4 V where the tools failed mainly due to excessive flank wear. Effective chip control was achieved when machining both materials because of the cyclic fragmentation mechanism of the newly generated chip...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} study the effect of {{cross-flow}} directions of an internal coolant on film cooling performance, the discharge coefficients and film cooling effectiveness with one inlet and double outlet hole injections were simulated.

40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} "in vitro" {{the consistency}} of the water <b>coolant</b> <b>supply</b> for five ultrasonic scaler systems in relation to the tip type and different coolant settings. Material and Methods: The systems were: EMS PM- 400, EMS PM- 600, Satelec P-max, Dürr Vector and Dentsply Cavitron. For each system, three units were used and on each unit various tips were tested. The tips were run unloaded for 1 min. at full and medium water supply setting. Results: At full water coolant setting, the PM- 400, PM- 600 and Cavitron supplied on average > 45 ml/min. of water coolant (51. 5, 46. 3 and 46. 9 ml/min., respectively). The P-max supplied 25 ml/min. and the Vector supplied 4. 9 ml/min. At medium setting, the PM- 400 and PM- 600 supplied approximately 50 % of the volume given at the full coolant setting (25. 0 and 26. 3 ml/min., respectively). The Cavitron supplied approximately 40 % at medium setting (18. 2 ml/min.) and the P-max supplied approximately 25 % (5. 7 ml/min.). Conclusion: The coolant control system of the different units did not provide a reliable indication of the water flow. Also, some perio tips gave less water coolant as compared with other tips of the same brand. Consequently, a change of tips during treatment may require adjustment of the water <b>coolant</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R
