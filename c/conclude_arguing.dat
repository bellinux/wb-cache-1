40|$|In {{this essay}} we try {{an answer to}} the {{question}} has intentionality to be reduced to anything? We propose {{that it is possible to}} reduce any variety of intentionality to a specification of mechanisms (internal organization of the items involved in a given intentional phenomenon) and a historical pattern of interaction (structure of mutual significant relations historically acquired by different items involved in the same intentional phenomenon). We first clarify the meaning of this proposal having recourse to the Ruth Millikan’s teleosemantics. Then, we assess the relevance and feasibility of our proposal, considering, in a succession, the case of animals and humans, of machines, and of sophisticated human collectives.

40|$|We {{apply the}} theory {{developed}} in I 1 to two deterministic nonlinear systems with few {{degrees of freedom}} (mappings). The first mapping considered is known to exactly satisfy the prescriptions laid down in I to obtain the Fokker-Planck equation associated to Brownian motion. For the second mapping, due to its more complex form, {{it is not possible}} to prove analytically that it too satisfies the prescriptions of 1; however, we show numerically that this fact is plausible, at least in the chaotic regime. For both cases we show that indeed Brownian motion for the variable of interest w arises.

40|$|Digital Storytelling (DS) is a {{creative}} combination {{of images and}} sound that allows the production of pedagogical resources with high potential for teaching and learning. Recent research shows that teachers´ familiarity, confidence and skills in integrating technology into the curriculum are dependent on education programs that provide technology-rich experiences throughout {{all aspects of the}} training. Aware of this reality and responsible for preparing digitally wise teachers, a DS activity was implemented with a group of post graduate teachers who attended a program on Educational Technology. For one semester teachers studied the theory of visual learning, prepared still images and created digital stories for classroom use.

40|$|We have {{performed}} collinear and non collinear calculations on neutral Bi 4 Mn, and collinear ones on ionized Bi 4 Mn with charges + 1 and - 1 {{to find out}} why theoretical calculations will not predict the magnetic state found in the experiment. We have used the density functional theory to find a fit between the theoretical prediction of the magnetic moment with the experimental value. Our calculations have consisted in a structure search of local energy minima, and then a search of the magnetic lowest energy state for each resulting isomer. The geometry optimization found 3 local minima whose fundamental state is the doublet spin state, which could not be found in previous theoretical works, but they are higher in energy than the lowest-lying isomer by approximately 1. 75 eV. This magnetic state could help understand the experiment. Calculations of non-collinear magnetic states for the Bi 4 Mn do not lower the total magnetic moment. We <b>conclude</b> <b>arguing</b> how the 3 isomers with doublet state could actually be the ones measured in the experiment. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

To this purpose we outline an ad hoc methodology which implements the traditional bilateral exchange rate measures to test effects of multilateral exchange rate volatility on growth of per capita GDP. Our estimates show that both factors (quality of institutions and reduction of multilateral volatility) significantly and positively affect growth and conditional convergence. We observe that MENA countries are not far from EU and OECD countries in terms of exchange rate volatility, but much below in terms of institutional quality. We finally simulate the {{potential effects}} of an improvement in institutional quality in MENA countries on their process of growth and conditional convergence. We <b>conclude</b> <b>arguing</b> that regional integration may be highly beneficial for such countries, mainly because of its effects on institutional quality. 2 ̆ 013 institutions; exchange rate; economic polic...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{symbolism}} {{in mathematics}} {{is probably the}} mostly quoted reason people use for explaining their lack of understanding and difficulties in learning mathematics. We will consider symbolism as a conceptual barrier drawing on some recent findings in historical epistemology and cognitive psychology. Instead of relying on the narrow psychological interpretation of epistemic obstacles we use the barrier for situating symbolism in the ‘ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny’-debate. Drawing on a recent study within historical epistemology we show how early symbolism functioned in a way similar to concrete operational schemes. Furthermore we will discuss several studies from cognitive psychology which {{come to the conclusion}} that symbolism is not as abstract and arbitrary as one considers but often relies on perceptually organized grouping and concrete spatial relations. We will use operations on fractions to show that the reliance on concrete spatial operations also provides opportunities for teaching. We will <b>conclude</b> <b>arguing</b> that a better conceptual understanding of symbolism by teachers will prepare them for possible difficulties that students will be confronted with in the classroom...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the restructuring {{process of the}} Italian fixed TLC industry, which the recent debate has deemed as far from being satisfactorily completed. We {{will focus on the}} feasibility and desirability of alternative vertical structures for the Italian fixed communication industry, considering in particular the structural separation – as opposed to integration – of the former monopolist. After a introductory discussion of the most critical characteristics of the sector and a brief portrait of the Italian industry for fixed telecommunication services, we focus on the regulatory framework currently in force. This body of regulation is inspired by facility-based competition, in line with EU directives, and characterised by vertical integration coupled with accounting separation between network and commercial costs: the analysis stresses both its (actual and potential) advantages as well as drawbacks {{from the point of view}} of regulatory as well as competition policies, finding substantial empirical evidence of anticompetitive behaviour. We will then consider an alternative industry design, implying structural separation of the network from incumbent's commercial divisions, as inspired by service-based competition. In the final section we <b>conclude</b> <b>arguing</b> in favour of ownership unbundling of the network...|$|E

40|$|My aim in {{this article}} is to present a new field of research, namely the Developmental Valence of Cultural Matrices (DVoCM) studies. The topic is what in {{cultural}} matrices limits (cultural adversity) or extends (cultural felicity) the optimal development of human cognitive abilities – a phenomenon termed Theuth effect. Cognitive abilities are broadly defined as information processing, whatever the information processing mode: by sensation and perception (including sensorimotor aptitudes), by emotions or by high-level mental abilities. In the first part, I provide several examples of the powerful effects of cultural matrices on brain structures and human cognitive abilities, I outline recent attempts of synthesizing them in terms of methodological approaches or theories, and I point out some of the major limits of these approaches. In the second part, I define the objectives of the DVoCM studies, and I describe the methods to be developed in order to promote research on the Theuth effect. I <b>conclude</b> <b>arguing</b> that the evaluation of the developmental valence of cultural matrices would enrich our knowledge of cultural diversity, and would be a valuable indicator of the overall wellbeing of human life forms...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is, on the one hand, to {{describe}} what I call “tightrope walker love” –the contemporary model of love in Western societies−; on the other, I aim to examine critically its contradictions. This new style of love, which has transcended, but not totally overcome, traditional romanticism, and which is near A. Giddens’ “confluent love” and “pure relation”, has the following features: in relation to its predecessors, it is more democratic; more individualistic; more intimate; more sophisticated {{from the point of view}} of emotional intelligence and pliable sexuality; more egalitarian; more utilitarian; and more legalist. However, two kinds of contradictions may be raised: external and internal. External contradictions involve, firstly, the flexibility of the labor market and the economy, in contrast with the psychological assumption of couples and families; and secondly, gender inequality, which denies the whole project. The internal contradictions –those that affect its self-description− may be summed up in the antinomy “liquidity” versus “attachment”. I will <b>conclude</b> <b>arguing</b> in favor of this new style of love, which is morally superior to the other models available, and contend that is contradictions, even if not completely solved, may be softened to a great extent...|$|E

40|$|This paper elaborates {{about the}} {{potential}} risk of systemic instabilities in future networks and proposes a methodology to mitigate it.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that adults are successful at visually tracking rigidly moving items, but experience great difficulties when tracking substance-like ‘‘pouring’’ items. Using a comparative approach, we investigated whether the presence/absence of the grammatical count–mass distinction influences adults and children’s ability to attentively track objects versus substances. More specifically, we aimed to explore whether the higher success at tracking rigid over substance-like items appears universally or whether speakers of classifier languages (like Japanese, not marking the object–substance distinction) are advantaged at tracking substances as compared to speakers of non-classifier languages (like Swiss German, marking the object–substance distinction). Our results supported the idea that language has no effect on low-level cognitive processes such as the attentive visual processing of objects and substances.

40|$|This thesis {{will address}} the impact of {{political}} and economic forces on the equitable access to fresh water in Ecuador. Demographic factors such as the rural-to-urban migration and the political and economic forces have strongly influenced the debate over the privatization of the provision of potable water and sanitation services. Within the context of Ecuador, two different approaches by the largest cities, Quito and Guayaquil, are analyzed; in Guayaquil, the services were privatized, while in Quito, the public utility was corporatized, remaining under public control. It <b>concludes</b> <b>arguing</b> that in the face of political instability and a lack of regulatory enforcement, neither public nor private provision adequately supplies marginalized communities with water and sanitation services. Watershed management is therefore crucial to maintaining a sound city water-management plan. Its flexibility and openness to innovative alliances between various stakeholders creates great potential for this approach...|$|R

In order to do so, initially an inedited theoretical discussion regarding the analysis {{of the relationship between the}} degree of centrality of a city and the behavior of financial systems is made. This analysis is carried out bearing in mind the concept of both liquidity preference and the endogeneity of money supply derived from Keynes (1937). An empirical investigation of the Brazilian case follows. In the investigation, it is proposed a hierarchy of the financial system for every municipality in Brazil. Based on this hierarchy the behavior of the bank system is analyzed.
