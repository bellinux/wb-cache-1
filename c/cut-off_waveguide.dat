40|$|Unusual {{backward}} and forward wave propagation in below <b>cut-off</b> <b>waveguides</b> loaded with dielectric metamaterials comprised of linear arrays of dielectric resonators (DRs) {{has been investigated}} by using theoretical, numerical, and experimental methods. Transmission bands were shown to correspond to three lowest resonances in arrays and were analyzed by using the concepts of magneto- and electro-inductive (MI and EI) waves describing the transfer of resonance excitation along the chains of coupled resonators. Equivalent circuit models (ECMs) have been constructed to describe MI and EI wave propagation and to obtain the dispersion diagrams. Good agreement between the obtained data {{and the results of}} full-wave simulations, theoretical calculations, and experiments provided an opportunity to determine coupling coefficients characterizing interaction between DRs in arrays at various resonances. It was shown that ripples observed in below cut-off transmission bands are transmission resonances caused by Fabry-Perot oscillations of inductive waves at impedance mismatch at the array ends. Fitting the transmission spectra for MI/EI waves in arrays, calculated by using the Transfer Matrix Method to the spectra obtained by using full-wave simulations/measurements, allowed for determining the ECM parameters to fully characterize the DR array properties...|$|R

40|$|Many {{theoretical}} and experimental investigations have presented {{a conclusion that}} evanescent electromagnetic modes can superluminally propagate. However, in this paper, we show that the average energy velocity of evanescent modes inside a <b>cut-off</b> <b>waveguide</b> is always {{less than or equal}} to the velocity of light in vacuum, while the instantaneous energy velocity can be superluminal, which does not violate causality according to quantum field theory: the fact that a particle can propagate over a space-like interval does preserve causality provided that here a measurement performed at one point cannot affect another measurement at a point separated from the first with a space-like interval.

40|$|Optical {{high-voltage}} sensors have outstanding {{advantages in}} terms of isolation and immunity to electromagnetic interference. So far, several configurations have been proposed, mostly based on integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometers [1] or polarization/phase rotation in piezo-electric crystal [2]. While the first scheme requires initial electrical bias {{to compensate for the}} phase mismatch between the two arms, the second one requires interrogation or phase noise reduction systems that are expensive to implement. Near <b>cut-off</b> optical <b>waveguide</b> devices have been already reported in LiNbO 3. In particular, the use of <b>waveguides</b> at <b>cut-off</b> was proposed for modulation in the field of optical communications [3, 4] and sensing [5]. We present a novel integrated optical high voltage sensor based on a Z-cut LiNbO 3 which operates without any metallic parts. The proposed device is sketched in Fig. 1 (left). An annealed proton exchange (APE) <b>waveguide</b> near <b>cut-off</b> is fabricated in Z-cut LiNbO 3 and centered in a domain inverted region. The application of an external electric field parallel to the z axis of the device produces a refractive index change n between positive and negative domains given by ne 3 r 33 E, where E is the intensity of the external electric field along the z-axis, ne= 2. 14 and r 33 = 30. 8 pm/V are the refractive index and the electro-optic coefficient along the z-axis, respectively. As a consequence the optical mode will broaden so that, after a sufficient propagation length, a loss is produced due to a mode-profile mismatch of the guided modes between active and passive regions...|$|R
40|$|Tweek {{atmospherics}} {{generated by}} lightning discharges and propagated in the night-time Earth-ionosphere waveguide, have often very pronounced dispersive features near {{the first few}} <b>waveguide</b> <b>cut-off</b> frequencies (fcm~mdot{s} fc 1 , fc 1 ~ 1. 6 – 1. 9 kHz, m= 1, 2,...,), being very extended in time, and have rather large amplitudes of oscillations with periods corresponding to the narrow vicinity of the cut-off frequencies. In this paper an analytical approach is developed to describe the waveform of distant tweeks. It {{is based on the}} solving of the Maxwell equations in two qualitatively different regions, whose changes are related in the first instance to the changes in the relative magnitudes of the displacement current and components of the conduction currents, and the following asymptotic matching of the solutions in the transitional region. The analytical night-time waveguide model accounts for both anisotropy and vertical inhomogeneity of the low ionosphere. The model is valid for upper ELF – lower VLF range and is well suitable for the analysis of the QTEm modes in the cut-off frequency regions, which determine {{the most important part of}} the tweek spectra and tweek amplitudes. The influence of the different ionospheric heights on the tweek characteristics is determined. The efficiency of the tweek generation by cloud-to-cloud discharge is also evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Using {{transform}} techniques, a time dependent {{study has}} been made of the evanescent wave in a waveguide or similar dispersive medium, Firstly, the field created by the application of a unit step modulated carrier wave to an unterminated waveguide, cut-off with respect to the carrier frequency, has been investigated as a function of time and the distance from the point of application. The behaviour of the transverse electric and magnetic field components and the resulting Poynting vector has been presented graphically. Secondly, the interaction of nanosecond microwave carrier pulses with a terminated section of <b>cut-off</b> <b>waveguide</b> was investigated theoretically and experimentally. This waveguide was cut-off with respect to the carrier frequency and was interposed between two identical propagating guides.

40|$|Electron {{cyclotron}} maser (ECM) oscillators {{are high}} power sources of microwave radiation and have applications in fusion plasma heating and diagnostics with potential for radar and telecommunications systems. The radiation comes from coherent bremsstrahlung emission by relativistic electrons gyrating in a magnetic field. It {{has been observed}} that the University of Strathclyde ECM oscillators fitted with high-current explosive electron emission cathodes exhibit a rapid modulation in the amplitude of the microwave output signal, whereas similar configurations using a thermionic emission cathode do not. This rapid communication describes preliminary experiments investigating this complex behaviour. In particular, it is of interest to establish whether the modulations were due to the cathode emission process or some dynamic cavity phenomena. We will present experimental results demonstrating {{a connection between the}} automodulation behaviour and the length of the interaction space in a 23 GHz ECM. The ECM had an ill-defined cavity consisting of a cylindrical copper waveguide of 1 m length. The magnetic field limited the length of the interaction space to < 9 cm (the length of its central plateau), adjustable using <b>waveguide</b> <b>cut-off</b> reflectors. With an 8 cm long interaction space the output signal from the ECM demonstrated a full amplitude modulation with a period of ~ 4 - 7 ns, but reducing the length to 1. 5 cm caused the modulation amplitude to reduce to ~ 20 %, with a period of ~ 20 ns whilst simultaneously changing in nature from stochastic to cyclical...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss and review several aspects {{of the effect of}} {{boundary}} conditions and structured environments on dispersion and resonance interactions involving atoms or molecules, as well as on vacuum field fluctuations. We first consider the case of a perfect mirror, which is free to move around an equilibrium position and whose mechanical degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically. We investigate how the quantum fluctuations of the mirror's position affect vacuum field fluctuations for both a one-dimensional scalar and electromagnetic field, showing that the effect is particularly significant in the proximity of the moving mirror. This result can be also relevant for possible gravitational effects, since the field energy density couples to gravity. We stress that this interaction-induced modification of the vacuum field fluctuations can be probed through the Casimir-Polder interaction with a polarizable body, thus allowing to detect the effect of the mirror's quantum position fluctuations. We then consider the effect of an environment such as an isotropic photonic crystal or a metallic waveguide, on the resonance interaction between two entangled identical atoms, one excited and the other in the ground state. We discuss the strong dependence of the resonance interaction with the relative position of the atomic transition frequency with the gap of the photonic crystal in the former case, and with the <b>cut-off</b> frequency of <b>waveguide</b> in the latter.

40|$|We {{present a}} quantum-field-theoretical {{framework}} based on path integrals and Feynman diagrams {{for the investigation}} of the quantum-optical properties of one-dimensional waveguiding structures with embedded quantum impurities. In particular, we obtain the Green's functions for a waveguide with an embedded two-level system in the single- and two-excitation sector for arbitrary dispersion relations. In the single excitation sector, we show how to sum the diagrammatic perturbation series to all orders and thus obtain explicit expressions for physical quantities such as the spectral density and the scattering matrix. In the two-excitation sector, we show that strictly linear dispersion relations exhibit the special property that the corresponding diagrammatic perturbation series terminates after two terms, again allowing for closed-form expressions for physical quantities. In the case of general dispersion relations, notably those exhibiting a band edge or <b>waveguide</b> <b>cut-off</b> frequencies, the perturbation series cannot be summed explicitly. Instead, we derive a self-consistent T-matrix equation that reduces the computational effort to that of a single-excitation computation. This analysis allows us to identify a Fano resonance between the occupied quantum impurity and a free photon in the waveguide as a unique signature of the few-photon nonlinearity inherent in such systems. In addition, our diagrammatic approach allows for the classification of different physical processes such as the creation of photon-photon correlations and interaction-induced radiation trapping - the latter being absent for strictly linear dispersion relations. Our framework can {{serve as the basis for}} further studies that involve more complex scenarios such as several and many-level quantum impurities, networks of coupled waveguides, disordered systems, and non-equilibrium effects.

40|$|Observations {{of large}} explosions in the {{atmosphere}} at long range are dominated by a leading pulse of large amplitude and long period that is often followed {{by a series of}} higher frequency impulses usually of smaller amplitude. This description can be interpreted using linearized acoustic-gravity wave theory in terms of a Lamb wave arrival followed by ducted acoustic and/or gravity waves. This pattern of arrivals is not the same at all ranges nor is it independent of the source energy or of the altitude of the source. Earlier, Pierce, using an isothermal, windless atmospheric model, theoretically formulated the distances beyond which the Lamb wave would just be discernible and also where it would dominate the arriving signals for a specified explosion source. In this work the authors have evaluated these distances for the cases of both an inviscid and a viscous fluid for the source energies of interest to the CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty) R and D work at Los Alamos. Although the inviscid results are analytic, the fully viscous solutions are iterative. For the inviscid solutions, the authors find that the Lamb wave domination distance is proportional to wave frequency at frequencies large with respect to the acoustic <b>waveguide</b> <b>cut-off</b> frequency. Under similar conditions they also find that the computed distances are linearly proportional to the source height. At 1 Hz for example, the Lamb wave must propagate about 200 km before having a significant amplitude. For a viscous fluid they found slight increases in the distances compared to an inviscid fluid with the lower frequencies, near the acoustic cut-off frequency, exhibiting the greatest changes. During the period from 1981 [...] 1994 at Los Alamos, they have also observed infrasound from eight point source, near-surface ANFO explosions at White Sands Missile Range events even though the ducted acoustic waves were observed. In this work, they will compare the current theory against some of these observations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the factors which control the gain and amplification properties in conjugated materials. Conjugated polymers and perylene dyes are highly fluorescent, are easy to process into thin films, and exhibit strong amplification over a broad gain bandwidth making them ideal for use in lasers and amplifiers. The stimulated emission created when thin films of the red emitting polymer poly(2 -methoxy- 5 -(2 '-ethylhexyloxy) - p-phenylenvinylene) (MEH-PPV) were photoexcited with high energy laser pulses was investigated. This was characterised by a dramatic narrowing of the emission spectrum which has been assigned to amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). The emission was found to have a gaussian profile and the gain coefficient was found to be 4 cm- 1. The temperature dependence of the absorption, photoluminescence and ASE of films of MEH-PPV was measured. The effect of film morphology on the photophysical properties was investigated by using films cast from two spinning solvents, chlorobenzene (CB) and tetrahydrofuran (THE). Film morphology was found to greatly affect the temperature dependence. A particularly important property is the spectral position of the ASE and the factors which affect it. By controlling the film thickness close to the <b>cut-off</b> thickness for <b>waveguiding</b> in the polymer film it was shown that the peak position of the ASE could be tuned by 31 nm. Modelling of the waveguide modes in the polymer films was used to explain this effect. The cut-off wavelength for each film was measured and good agreement with the theory was found. In order to investigate ways in which energy transfer could be used to control the emission, two perylene dyes were used as a donor-acceptor pair in a host matrix of poly methymethacralate (PMMA). The position of the ASE was found to depend on the acceptor concentration. Measurements of the photoluminescence quantum yield and time-resolved luminescence measurements showed that the energy transfer coefficient was 5 x 10 (^ 11) mol(^- 1) d(^ 3...|$|R
40|$|Grid-scale {{integration}} {{of renewable energy}} sources and smart grid devices has created new demands in flexible power conversion. State-of-the-art semiconductor power switches present limitations in power handling capability, as well as forward and reverse breakdown voltages. Superconducting materials are a viable alternative due to their robustness against high ampacities, large electric fields and abrupt changes in power flow. This work pays focus to material testing and apparatus design for an antenna-coupled cryotron (ACC), which is a superconducting power switch. Design, fabrication and testing are examined for a longitudinal resonant cavity, paired with monopole transmit and modified slot receive antennae. These couple radio frequency (RF) energy into superconducting thin film niobium (Nb) carrying high current densities (∼ 105 A/cm 2), thereby creating an antenna-coupled cryotron. Induced electromagnetic field effects at the receive antenna alter superconductive fluid dynamics. The theorized quality in manipulating this mechanism is a rapid normal-conductivity transition (µs), which affects a switch 2 ̆ 2 off 2 ̆ 2 state. Functional evaluation of the device as a waveguide revealed evanescent mode resonance at frequencies below the <b>waveguide</b> <b>cut-off</b> of ∼ 18 GHz. The thin film Nb was deposited on a quartz dielectric, which penetrated the waveguide and supported evanescent resonances within the structure. Altered resistivity and critical transition-point properties emerged from device testing at applied RF. When the Nb film temperature-dependent coherence length was comparable to its thickness, perpendicular magnetic field application generated an Abrikosov vortex state, energetically favoring a mixed domain condensate. Interaction of the magnetically-induced flux vortex lattice with Lorentz current forces gave rise to resistive changes within the metal. Three resistive transition mechanisms developed: a latch to normal state resistance, attributed to cooper-pair destruction avalanche induced near critical transition points; a small reversible increase in resistance (∼mV), arising from flux-flow within an intermediate state at peak resonance; as well as temporal alterations in superfluid dynamics from disequilibrium in the quasi-particle population. The RF induced superfluid effects were observable in separate terms of electric and thermodynamic fluctuations. Motivation for this work is the eventual design of a high voltage, high current and low cost power switch, able to function where existing semiconductor technology fails. Concentration is paid to the fundamental theory, physics and methodology in conceptual testing and design of prototype ACCs. Assessment focuses on preliminary findings and concludes with next stage design requirements...|$|R
