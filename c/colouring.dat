40|$|In {{this chapter}} the {{importance}} of <b>colour</b> as a design, marketing and sales tool for industry is outlined {{to substantiate the need}} for a strong knowledge of <b>colour</b> and the need to work confidently and proficiently with <b>colour.</b> The chapter is designed in a manner that promotes knowledge development and inspiration, and for the more proactive reader a rich experience of <b>colour</b> can be gained by working through the chapter activities, initially at a computer and later with pigments (paints, dyes), which is highly encouraged and recommended. This workshop approach enables you to experiment with <b>colour</b> mixing and <b>colour</b> schemes to better appreciate <b>colour</b> and its application, without which the theories become just a concept; there really is little substitute for experimentation. A short history of <b>colour</b> is given that focuses on the building of the scientific underpinning of the most predominant theories of <b>colour</b> used today in relation to textile-based products (fashion). Insight is also given into <b>colour</b> psychology in relation to creating colour-ways, <b>colour</b> ranges and <b>colour</b> themes and to <b>colour</b> forecasting. <b>Colour</b> terminology is given and discussed throughout the chapter and the following fundamental theories and <b>colour</b> characteristics are also discussed: •	The principles of additive <b>colour</b> mixing and subtractive <b>colour</b> mixing •	The six-hue <b>colour</b> wheel and the twelve-hue <b>colour</b> wheel •	<b>Colour</b> schemes and <b>colour</b> combinations •	Metamerism •	<b>Colour</b> deficiency (<b>colour</b> blindness) •	<b>Colour</b> measuremen...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between <b>colour</b> perception and <b>colour</b> language. Three questions are addressed. The first relates {{to the influence of}} colour- category membership on <b>colour</b> perception, the second to potential influences of <b>colour</b> language on <b>colour</b> perception. The third question asks whether non-linguistic differences in <b>colour</b> perception may influence differences in <b>colour</b> language. Experimental studies provide evidence for categorical <b>colour</b> perception. However, unlike previous studies, the experiments reported here found no evidence that linguistic <b>colour</b> categories underpin, or influence, <b>colour</b> perception. The reasons for this difference are discussed. The findings support the view that linguistic <b>colour</b> categories reflect non-linguistic perceptual <b>colour</b> categories. Finally evidence is presented suggesting that physiological differences in <b>colour</b> perception may influence the <b>colour</b> categories encoded by languages...|$|R

5|$|Sometimes {{the colour}} of a tile is {{understood}} {{as part of the}} tiling; at other times arbitrary colours may be applied later. When discussing a tiling that is displayed in colours, to avoid ambiguity one needs to specify whether the colours are part of the tiling or just part of its illustration. This affects whether tiles with the same shape but different colours are considered identical, which in turn affects questions of symmetry. The four colour theorem states that for every tessellation of a normal Euclidean plane, with a set of four available colours, each tile can be coloured in one colour such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length. The <b>colouring</b> guaranteed by the four-colour theorem does not generally respect the symmetries of the tessellation. To produce a <b>colouring</b> which does, it is necessary to treat the colours as part of the tessellation. Here, as many as seven colours may be needed, as in the picture at right.|$|E
40|$|The memory <b>colour</b> {{reproduction}} {{is an important}} factor in judging image quality of photographic images of real life scenes. As the most important memory <b>colour</b> category, skin tone was extensively studied for preferred <b>colour</b> reproduction in this research. The methodology to study skin <b>colour</b> preference was then applied to study the <b>colour</b> preference of two other important <b>colour</b> categories: green foliage and blue sky. There are three essential parts for preferred skin <b>colour</b> enhancement: 1) building a skin <b>colour</b> model to detect skin <b>colours</b> or skin pixels; 2) finding a preferred skin <b>colour</b> region or a preferred skin <b>colour</b> centre; and 3) developing an algorithm to morph skin <b>colours</b> toward the preferred skin <b>colour</b> region. This study for skin <b>colour</b> enhancement started with the mathematical modelling of the skin <b>colour</b> region for skin <b>colour</b> detection. The modelling of skin <b>colours</b> was then applied to adjust skin <b>colours</b> of test images for psychophysical experiments that were to determine a preferred skin <b>colour</b> region. Finally, the skin <b>colour</b> modelling and the preferred skin <b>colour</b> centres were applied to adjust skin <b>colours</b> of digital photographic images for preferred <b>colour</b> reproduction. Two approaches were developed to model the skin <b>colour</b> distribution for skin <b>colour</b> detection. The first approach was to model a local <b>colour</b> region for general applications. A convex hull is constructed to fit the geometrical shape of a local region, and then the convex hull is approximated with mathematical formulae. The formulations and data fitting are adjusted with interactive 3 -D visualization. The approach is flexible for fitting data gamut with various mathematical forms for different purposes. The other approach was to model skin <b>colours</b> with elliptical shapes. Three elliptical skin <b>colour</b> models were developed for skin <b>colour</b> detection. The first one is to model the skin <b>colour</b> cluster using a single ellipse ignoring the lightness (or luminance) dependency. It is simple and efficient, and the skin <b>colour</b> detection accuracy may be adequate for many applications. In the second model, the skin <b>colour</b> ellipse is adapted to different lightness so that the shape of the ellipse fits the skin <b>colour</b> cluster more accurately. The model is more complex to train and is less efficient in computation, but it is more accurate in skin <b>colour</b> detection. In the third method, an ellipsoid is trained to fit the skin <b>colour</b> cluster. It is almost as simple to train as the first model, but the skin <b>colour</b> detection accuracy is improved. Finally, these models were applied to train mixed skin <b>colours,</b> African skin <b>colours,</b> Caucasian skin <b>colours,</b> and Asian skin <b>colours.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|A {{developmental}} association {{exists between}} <b>colour</b> preference and emerging <b>colour</b> term acquisition in young children. <b>Colour</b> preference might influence <b>colour</b> term acquisition by directing attention towards {{or away from}} a particular <b>colour,</b> making it more or less memorable. To investigate the role that <b>colour</b> preference may have in the acquisition of <b>colour</b> terms, experimental tasks of <b>colour</b> preference, discrimination, attention, memory, and new <b>colour</b> term learning, were given to three groups of participants (preschool children; primary school children; and adults). Each task utilized the same <b>colour</b> stimuli, which were four computer-simulated <b>colours,</b> matched perceptually to four different Munsell chips, drawn from the same <b>colour</b> category. Three <b>colours</b> varied systematically from an anchor <b>colour</b> (10 PB 4 / 8) only in saturation (10 PB 4 / 4), luminance (10 PB 6 / 8), or hue (5 P 4 / 8). Results showed that within-category <b>colour</b> preferences emerged with age, and that when established within individuals, most preferred <b>colours</b> were named significantly more accurately than least preferred <b>colours,</b> although this association {{did not appear to}} be mediated directly by attention or memory. Rather, perceptual saliency was shown to have a mediating role, to some extent, in determining the relationship between <b>colour</b> preference and the cognitive processing of <b>colour.</b> © 2009 The British Psychological Society...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTwo {{different}} <b>colours,</b> one {{presented to}} {{one eye and}} the other presented to the other eye, often create {{the impression of a}} third <b>colour.</b> This percept is known as binocular <b>colour</b> mixture. Here we use coloured stereograms to study binocular <b>colour</b> appearance. Vivid pastel <b>colours</b> are induced in monocular, achromatic patches, if these are placed in stereograms whose left and right images differ in <b>colour.</b> The build-up of the <b>colours</b> is slow and takes tens of seconds or even minutes in certain individuals. The induced <b>colours</b> remain visible during monocular viewing of the patch and decay gradually. The same <b>colours</b> are induced irrespective of whether the patches are placed in fusible or rivalrous stereograms. We show that these <b>colour</b> effects cannot be induced by monocular <b>colour</b> mechanisms, either alone or in combination with binocular <b>colour</b> mixing. We suggest that the <b>colours</b> are induced by a binocular feedback mechanism, which reduces <b>colour</b> differences between the <b>colour</b> appearances of two monocular images. Induced <b>colours</b> are not observed if the achromatic patches are binocular. However, induced <b>colours</b> are apparent if one switches to monocular viewing after prolonged binocular viewing of the binocular patches. This aftereffect suggests that binocular <b>colour</b> induction acts on the monocular representations of binocular images. We suggest that during binocular viewing the fast process of binocular <b>colour</b> mixing masks the changes in <b>colour</b> appearance produced by the much slower process of binocular <b>colour</b> induction...|$|R

5|$|After {{returning}} to Edmonton in 1982 and {{learning of the}} lead-level findings from the 1981 expedition, Beattie struggled to find a cause.

He came {{to suspect that the}} problems of lead poisoning compounded by the effects of scurvy could have been lethal for the Franklin crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of the buried crewmen on Beechey Island.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} research elaborates {{on some of}} the 'semantic' and 'algorithmic' aspects of the categorization process for thc <b>colour</b> domain.

They are capable of a variety of asexual means of reproduction including fragmentation, longitudinal and transverse fission and budding. Sea anemones for example can crawl across a surface leaving behind them detached pieces of the pedal disc which develop into new clonal individuals. Anthopleura species divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical <b>colouring</b> and patterning. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing on the column before the sea anemone tears itself apart. Zoanthids are capable of budding off new individuals.|$|E
5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey <b>colouring.</b> Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey <b>colouring,</b> and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{the adults}} may be {{confused}} with large native frogs from the genera Limnodynastes, Cyclorana, and Mixophyes.

Cane toads have been confused with the giant burrowing frog (Heleioporus australiacus), because both are large and warty in appearance; however, the latter can be readily distinguished from the former by its vertical pupils and its silver-grey (as opposed to gold) irises. Juvenile cane toads may {{be confused with}} species of the Uperoleia genus, but their adult colleagues can be distinguished by the lack of bright <b>colouring</b> on the groin and thighs.|$|E
40|$|Perceived object <b>colour</b> {{tends to}} stay {{constant}} under changes in illumination. This phenomenon is called <b>colour</b> constancy. <b>Colour</b> constancy {{is an essential}} component of <b>colour</b> perception and is typically studied in the laboratory via asymmetric <b>colour</b> matching experiments, in which the observer views two <b>colours</b> under two different illuminations side by side and makes matches between them. This situation is unlike <b>colour</b> constancy in the real world, which must typically involve a comparison between the <b>colour</b> one views and the <b>colour</b> one remembers - in other words, <b>colour</b> memory must be required. Furthermore, most <b>colour</b> constancy studies use twodimensional Mondrian images as experimental stimuli. These stimuli enable easy computer control of <b>colour</b> but exclude most of the natural perceptual cues such as binocular disparity, 3 D luminance shading, mutual reflection, surface texture, glossy highlights, all of which may contribute to <b>colour</b> perception. My aim, in this project, is to study the <b>colour</b> perception of real objects in a more natural environment. To do so, I have developed an experimental setup which preserves the advantages conferred by easy computer-driven control of <b>colour</b> as well as the natural binocular and monocular cues to 3 D shape. The setup also permits the use of real solid objects as stimuli, and the manipulation of their apparent surface <b>colour</b> as well as the background illumination. Thus, using this setup, I have been able to employ both 2 D and 3 D natural objects as stimuli and investigate aspects of <b>colour</b> perception related to <b>colour</b> constancy and <b>colour</b> memory as well as object familiarity. In developing and analysing these experiments, I have also introduced a new index of <b>colour</b> constancy which explicitly incorporates <b>colour</b> memory. My experiments reveal the following main principles: 1) <b>colour</b> constancy relies on <b>colour</b> memory, and is as good as <b>colour</b> memory allows; 2) <b>colour</b> and shape perception interact in both object similarity and discrimination tasks, indicating that <b>colour</b> and shape cannot be studied completely independently of each other; 3) object familiarity affects <b>colour</b> perception, for both foreground and background objects; 4) object familiarity also affects <b>colour</b> perception at perceptual levels, as measured by the reaction times and the range of appropriate <b>colours</b> accepted for an object.
