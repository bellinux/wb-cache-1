50|$|The drawbar system necessitated the {{implement}} {{having its}} own running gear (usually wheels) {{and in the}} case of a plow, <b>chisel</b> <b>cultivator</b> or harrow, some sort of lift mechanism to raise it out of the ground at turns or for transport. Drawbars necessarily posed a rollover risk depending on how the tractive torque was applied. The Fordson tractors (of which more units were produced and placed in service than any other farm tractor) was extremely prone to roll over backwards due to an excessively short wheelbase. The linkage between the implement and the tractor usually had some slack which could lead to jerky starts and greater wear and tear on the tractor and the equipment.|$|E
40|$|Over {{half of the}} {{arable land}} in the {{northern}} grains region of Australia is managed using no-till (NT), a farming method which has improved crop yields and soil quality while reducing the input and labour costs. However, concerns have arisen among farmers over the control of weeds in continuous NT systems. An occasional targeted tillage operation (termed strategic tillage - ST) has been proposed as a management tool to reduce problem weed populations but may adversely influence soil properties and those of associated microbial communities. To assess the potential impacts of a ST operation on soil properties, a Grey Vertosol with fifteen years of NT in Northern New South Wales, Australia was tilled using either a <b>chisel</b> <b>cultivator</b> or disc chain on March 15 th 2013 or on April 5 th 2013. We hypothesised that ST using these minimal or low soil inversion implements at either timing would not adversely influence soil properties in the short-term (4 - 7 weeks). The measured soil properties were soil volumetric moisture content (VMC), pH, bulk density (BD), electrical conductivity (EC), available phosphorus (P), soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), metabolic activity (MA), genetic structures of bacterial communities and wheat yield (t ha). We found that ST with either a <b>chisel</b> <b>cultivator</b> or a disc chain has great potential to assist in weed management as it did not statistically influence crop productivity or the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil, regardless of the tillage timing...|$|E
40|$|Currently farmers {{that are}} {{starting}} to engage in organic crop production, mostly oriented to conventional technologies, making small changes, and use the available agricultural tools. However, agricultural plants environment in the organic field characterized by physical, chemical and biological properties which different from intensive farming options. These conditions should {{be reflected in the}} selection of appropriate technological operations, which in turn fit into certain limitations. Research on the adaptation of the basic crop cultivation technologies to the requirements of organic production is carried out in IAEP. For that purpose we developed a model of perspective technical and technological provision of organic farmers. The model considers a set of organic crop rotation, and for each crop of which the corresponding organic technology used. Technical means are selected from the general list contained in the model, {{depending on the size of}} the farm and the selected level of crop productivity. Economic and environment indicators are also calculated. Particular attention of the model is drawn to the following group operations: mechanical tillage, application of organic fertilizers, weed and pest control. Generally, organic farmers use ordinary technical means, but the model also considers promising. We use tillage system with different depths for organic crop rotation: cereal crops - at depth of 12 - 16 cm, for vegetable crops and potatoes at depth of 22 - 24 cm by mould board plough. In the presence of strongly marked "subsoil layer" or waterproof horizon the subsoil shattering is conducted to a depth of 45 cm by <b>chisel</b> <b>cultivator.</b> Fall tillage is an effective way to control weeds, diseases and pests. Promising is the use of technical means for the local application of solid manure in the furrow. A particularly important task in organic agriculture is weed control. In addition to crop rotation, the cultivation of root crops used ridge system and previously developed and then half-forgotten, rotary harrows to handle the ridge slopes during the growing season. Such rotary harrows were very effective for weed control in potatoes field experiment in 2016. Following operations: seeds cover by biological drugs; biological drugs application during seeding and on plants during vegetations, are including in technologies for organic control of deceases and pests. As a promising area is consider to use one of the physical methods for the precise removal of weeds. Also, the idea of precision agriculture can be used for imaging of a disease or pest on vegetation and accurate extermination on the small patch by biological drugs. The model of promising technical and technological provision of organic farm can be transformed into a software system that will be useful for agricultural producers engaged in organic crop production, as well as organizations providing their technical means...|$|E
40|$|Ploughless {{cropping}} systems {{are becoming increasingly}} important in organic farming. The crop rotation trial in Güterfelde, Brandenburg, shows the long-term effects they have on weed infestation. Ploughless farming was practiced on a crop rotation system comprising of seven fields {{for a period of}} 16 years, with disc harrows and <b>chisel</b> <b>cultivators</b> being used instead. The assessment in spring before silage maize showed that, in comparison with farming systems using ploughs, long-term no-till farming increased the level of monocotyledonous weeds by a factor of 5. 9 and the level of dicotyledonous weeds by a factor of 1. 6. The total weed coverage ratio increased by a factor of 4. 7. Weed cover also increased by a factor of 5 in the non-competitive lupin population following long-term ploughless farming. The problem grass weed is Apera spica-venti. The number of silky bent grass panicles has increased in relation to the competitive ability of crop plant: For example by the factor of 1. 9 in winter rye and 12, 4 in winter triticale. Apera spica-venti dominated the blue lupin population due to ploughless farming. Organic farms need to counteract the significantly higher degree of weed infestation following long-term ploughless farming by using situable multiannual rotation systems combined with more intensive weed control. There is still a problem in managing the strong infestation by Apera spica-venti with ploughless farming for a long time...|$|R

The determination of penetration resistance pressure of the soil was done in field, with a penetrograph, and the experimental data were statistically analyzed, in order to assess the loading regimes faced by the active parts of agricultural machinery while working for soil processing, for estimating the influences on their durability. A durability case study on a real reversible <b>chisel</b> type <b>cultivator</b> blade was also conducted, using a 3 D finite element solid model and two classical 2 D models in order to determine its fatigue response, using as loads the determined soil resistance pressure...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] semiarid Mediterranean agroecosystems, low and erratic annual rainfall {{together with the}} widespread use of mouldboard ploughing (conventional tillage, CT), as the main traditional tillage practice, has led to a depletion of soil organic matter (SOM) and with increases in CO 2 emissions from soil to the atmosphere. In this study, we evaluated the viability of conservation tillage: RT, reduced tillage (<b>chisel</b> and <b>cultivator</b> ploughing) and, especially, NT (no-tillage) to reduce short-term (from 0 to 48 h after a tillage operation) and mid-term (from 0 h to several days since tillage operation) tillage-induced CO 2 emissions. The study was conducted in three long-term tillage experiments located at different sites of the Ebro river valley (NE Spain) across a precipitation gradient. Soils were classified as: Fluventic Xerocrept, Typic Xerofluvent and Xerollic Calciorthid. Soil temperature and water content were also measured in order to determine their influence on tillage-induced CO 2 fluxes. The majority of the CO 2 flux measured immediately after tillage ranged from 0. 17 to 6 g CO 2 m− 2 h− 1 and was from 3 to 15 times greater than the flux before tillage operations, except in NT where soil CO 2 flux was low and steady during the whole study period. Mid-term CO 2 emission showed a different trend depending on the time of the year in which tillage was implemented. Microclimatic soil conditions (soil temperature and water content) had little impact on soil CO 2 emission following tillage. In the semiarid Mediterranean agroecosystems studied, NT had low short-term soil CO 2 efflux compared with other soil tillage systems (e. g., conventional and reduced tillage) and therefore can be recommended to better manage C in soil.

The better emergence was obtained with 90 - 90 NP kg ha - 1. The seedling emergence decreased at higher doses of N and P. The interaction of tillage x fertilizer revealed that fertilizer {{at the rate of}} 90 - 150 kg ha - 1 and tillage practices with cultivator exhibited higher seedling emergence, while the plots ploughed with chisel plow and desi plow recorded decreased emergence. However, chisel plowing recorded higher fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency than the plots ploughed by cultivator or desi plough. Nitrogen use efficiency at high levels of nitrogen applications was low than in the low rates of N incorporation. It was concluded that tillage practices should be performed with cultivator and 90 kg N ha - 1 is suitable combination for seedling emergence and crop yield of maize...|$|R
