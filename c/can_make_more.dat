2500|$|The broad {{spectrum}} of wine styles produced in Anjou brings with it {{a wide variety of}} winemaking techniques. In areas such as the Coteaux du Layon, the wines are fermented in 400 l (106 gallons) [...] "double-barriques" [...] and submitted to partial malolactic fermentation. The basic still wines of Anjou blanc are made similar to still white wine production elsewhere though, as wine expert Jancis Robinson notes, they do have an historical association with being over sulfited. As red wine production continues to find a market, and plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon increase, more producers are experimented with the use of new oak barrels. In riper years Angevin producers <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>more</b> fuller bodied reds similar to those found in the Touraine wine reds but still relatively light when compared to the reds of warmer climates such as Bordeaux and the Rhone.|$|E
2500|$|He was {{described}} by social commentator and antitheist Christopher Hitchens in terms as [...] "Chaucerian fraud" [...] and a [...] "faith-based fraud." [...] Hitchens took special umbrage with Falwell's alignment with [...] "the most thuggish and demented Israeli settlers", and his declaration that 9/11 represented God's judgment on America's sinful behaviour; deeming it [...] "extraordinary that not even such a scandalous career is enough to shake our dumb addiction to the 'faith-based.'" [...] Hitchens also mentioned that, despite his support for Israel, Falwell [...] "kept saying to his own crowd, yes, {{you have got to}} like the Jews, because they <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>more</b> money in 10 minutes than you can make in a lifetime". Appearing on CNN a day after Falwell's death, Hitchens said, [...] "The empty life of this ugly little charlatan proves only one thing: that {{you can get away with}} the most extraordinary offenses to morality and to truth in this country if you will just get yourself called 'reverend'." [...] On C-SPAN, Hitchens made the comment that [...] "if he had been given an enema, he could have been buried in a matchbox".|$|E
2500|$|The Kaiser Family Foundation, a {{non-governmental}} organization that evaluated Cuba’s healthcare system in 2000-1 described Cuba as [...] "a shining {{example of the}} power of public health to transform the health of an entire country by a commitment to prevention and by careful management of its medical resources" [...] President of the World Bank James Wolfensohn also praised Cuba's healthcare system in 2001, saying that [...] "Cuba has done a great job on education and health", {{at the annual meeting of}} the Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Wayne Smith, former head of the US Interests Section in Havana identified [...] "the incredible dedication" [...] of Cubans to healthcare, adding that [...] "Doctors in Cuba <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>more</b> driving cabs and working in hotels, but they don't. They're just very dedicated". Dr. Robert N. Butler, who was president of the International Longevity Center in New York and a Pulitzer Prize-winning author on aging, traveled to Cuba to see firsthand how doctors were trained. He said a principal reason that some health standards in Cuba approach the high American level is that the Cuban system emphasizes early intervention. Clinic visits are free, and the focus is on preventing disease rather than treating it. [...] Furthermore, London's The Guardian newspaper lauded Cuba's public healthcare system for what it viewed as its high quality in a September 12, 2007 article.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the name, the Superfund {{trust fund}} lacks {{sufficient}} funds {{to clean up}} even {{a small number of}} the sites on the NPL. As a result, the EPA typically negotiates consent orders with PRPs to study sites and develop cleanup alternatives, subject to EPA oversight and approval of all such activities. The EPA then issues a Proposed Plans for remedial action for a site on which it takes public comment, after which it makes a cleanup decision in a Record of Decision (ROD). RODs are typically implemented under consent decrees by PRPs or under unilateral orders if consent cannot be reached. If a party fails to comply with such an order, it may be fined up to $37,500 for each day that non-compliance continues. A party that spends money to clean up a site may sue other PRPs in a contribution action under the CERCLA. CERCLA liability has generally been judicially established as joint and several among PRPs to the government for cleanup costs (i.e., each PRP is hypothetically responsible for all costs subject to contribution), but CERCLA liability is allocable among PRPs in contribution based on comparative fault. An [...] "orphan share" [...] is the share of costs at a Superfund site that is attributable to a PRP that is either unidentifiable or insolvent. The EPA tries to treat all PRPs equitably and fairly. Budgetary cuts and constraints <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>more</b> equitable treatment of PRPs more difficult.|$|E
