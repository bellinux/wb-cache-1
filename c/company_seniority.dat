40|$|This study {{examined}} the cardiorespiratory and anthropometric indices of professional classical ballet dancers in relation to <b>company</b> <b>seniority,</b> gender, and supplemental training. Forty-nine participants from an international touring company carried out a peak Vo(2) test and vertical jump test. Anthropometric measurements and supplemental training activities were also recorded for each participant. Statistical analyses showed significant differences between gender and dancer seniority levels. Gender differences were seen for jump height (M = 52. 7 +/- 7. 12 cm; F = 37. 6 +/- 5. 32 cm) and peak Vo(2) (M = 49. 32 +/- 3. 72 ml. kg(- 1). min(- 1); F = 43. 3 +/- 5. 16 ml. kg(- 1). min(- 1)). Differences were also seen between dancer levels for peak Vo(2) (artist = 46. 47 +/- 4. 67 ml. kg(- 1). min(- 1); first artist = 42. 72 +/- 5. 81 ml. kg(- 1). min(- 1); soloist = 43. 38 +/- 7. 14 ml. kg(- 1). min(- 1); principal = 49. 04 +/- 3. 63 ml. kg(- 1). min(- 1)) and jump height (artist = 42. 0 +/- 9. 11 cm; first artist = 50. 33 +/- 11. 65 cm; soloist = 45. 6 +/- 9. 78 cm; principal = 44. 67 +/- 9. 53 cm). Pairwise post hoc comparisons showed that corps and principals had significantly greater relative peak Vo(2) than first artists and soloists (p < 0. 05), while soloists and first artists had significantly greater jump heights compared to principals and corps (p < 0. 05). Analysis of covariance modeling indicated that the self-reported mode of supplemental training had no association with relative peak Vo(2) or the percentage at which ventilatory threshold occurred. The present study has provided further insight into the cardiorespiratory profiles of classical ballet dancers, where soloists have significantly greater power capacities compared to principals and corps, who in turn had significantly greater aerobic power. These data can help guide strength and conditioning intervention strategies that need {{to take into account}} the nuances of the different seniority levels within a dance company...|$|E

40|$| had {{seniority}} provisions on promotions of employees, {{and that}} in 97 % of the establishments surveyed, there was a seniority provision on lay-offs. In a more recent study onProvisions in Collective Agreements covering office employees in Canadian manufacturing industries (1967), 86 % of the agreements studied had a provision regarding seniority on promotion, while 97 % of the agreements examined had a provision regarding seniority on lay-off. So much for the incidence {{of some of the}} most important seniority provisions ; it should perhaps be emphasized that these data are for the manufacturing sector only. However, our definite impression is that the figures just quoted represent a fairly accurate picture of the incidence of seniority provisions in a number of Canadian industrial and occupational sectors. Let us now turn to the substance of seniority provisions and proceed somewhat systematically with various concepts. 1. We would broadly define seniority as the status acquired by an employee at his (her) place of employment through his (her) length of service. This definition, at brief as it is, raises some questions on our minds. It will be understood that only some of these questions can be raised here. How is seniority acquired ? How is it lost ? For example, is an employee going to accumulate seniority starting with his (her) first day of employment with the company, or is he (she) going to start accumulating seniority once he (she) has successfully completed his (her) probationary period ? Once the employee's probationary period is successfully completed, is the length of this period going to be credited to the employee in terms of seniority ? What happens to the employee's seniority when for example she or he is on temporary lay-off? How long can the employee retain the seniority he or she had accumulated prior to being laid-off ? What happens to her seniority when an employee goes on maternity leave ? Does she retain it ? Or does she not only retain it, but continue to accumulate it while she is on leave ? Or can she accumulate seniority only during a certain period of her leave ? More generally, could there be some types of leave during which continued accumulation of seniority would be provided for, while seniority accumulated prior to the taking of the leave would simply be retained during other types of leave? Does an employee who has had to leave the company through no fault of his (her) own, or has simply decided to leave the company, automatically lose his (her) seniority ? 4 These are a few of the many questions that can be raised. 2. For the purpose of analyzing seniority provisions, we have considered two major types of seniority concepts : the first one, straight seniority, means that length of service is the only factor to be considered ; for example, employees would be promoted on the basis of their length of service alone ; in our own experience, this type of seniority is very seldom found in collective agreements in relation to promotions and lay-offs. Which type of seniority concept is, then, more frequently found ?Contingent or modified seniority is far more prevalent in the agreements we have analyzed ; and it simply means that other factors than length of service (such as ability to do the job, performance, punctuality, etc.) are to be considered along with length of service. Perhaps two brief examples here may be more helpful than a lengthy explanation. Here are, then, two examples of collective agreement provisions based in our view on the concept of contingent or modified seniority :Example 1  : « In cases of promotions, [...] ., the skills, ability and efficiency of the employees shall be the governing factor and where these things are equal, seniority shall be the governing factor [...] .  »Example 2  : « In the event of reduction of staff and rehiring of employees seniority shall apply provided the employée with the greater amount of seniority can satisfactorily perform the job he is assigned to, or can learn the job within reasonable time [...] .  »These two provisions, illustrating the concept of contingent or modified seniority, are also an illustration of two subconcepts. Example 1 was indeed based on what could be called the concept ofequal ability, meaning that seniority will govern if there is equality in ability (and other factors, if any) to perform the job ; example 2 was based, on the other hand, on the concept ofsufficient ability, meaning that seniority will govern if the employee has sufficient ability to perform the job. Fields of seniority recognition 3. The two provisions just cited also provided examples of areas where seniority would be taken into account — or what might be called « fields of seniority recognition ». Example 1 had to do with the problem of staff reduction and rehiring, while example 2 dealt with promotions. There can of course be other fields of seniority recognition : transfers, choice of vacation time, choice of working time, to mention a few. There is also the range of length-of-service related benefits such as graduated vacation plans, sick leave, etc., that one finds in collective agreements. Seniority Units 4. A brief word should now perhaps be said about seniority units; in other words (and to proceed descriptively) one can have occupation-wide, department-wide, plant-wide, company-wide (in multi-plant <b>company),</b> etc., <b>seniority</b> units. Without wanting to go into too many details, our understanding of the seniority unit it the unit within which the years of service of the employee are considered : for example, an employee may have been fifteen years, in the plant, but only 7 years in department X of the plant. It could be stated, therefore, that such an employee has fifteen years' plant seniority, and 7 years' seniority in department X. These may be very important distinction since the seniority of the employee (together with other factors, depending on that the provision says) might be considered on a plant-wide basis in cases of lay-offs for example ; and his seniority might be considered on a department-wide basis in cases of promotions. One example will be provided here of the latter type of provisions, and one example of the former 5. Enough has perhaps been stated at this point to suggest that seniority provisions can indeed be very important to employees : in terms not only of promotional opportunities, but also in terms of job protection, work satisfaction, etc. Seniority provisions in a context of changing technologyYet when we read a seniority provision, we always tend to place it — perhaps as should be done — in the world of work of 1970, which is one of fast changing technology. In relation to this very point, and before concluding, a few questions will be raised. When a seniority clause provides that « in cases of promotions, [...] . the skills, ability and efficiency of the employees shall be the governing factor and where these things are equal, seniority shall be the governing factor [...] .  » some questions are raised in our minds and these questions are simply submitted here for consideration. In a context of a changing technology resulting in new skill requirements, what would be the real meaning of « equal ability » as between senior and younger employees, in organizations where senior employees — set in their habits and perhaps in skills in need of updating — would be competing for promotion with younger employees freshly graduated from recognized institutes of technology and science, and mastering the knowledge required for an effective performance in those jobs open for promotion ? Furthermore, in these situations, what would be attitude of an employee's organization towards changes in technology, an organization whose membership might be considered « senior » in terms of length of service ? Or, what would be the attitude of an employees' organization with a younger membership towards displaced older employees ? And what would be the attitude of management naturally — as it should — preoccupied with efficiency ?CONCLUSIONThese were some questions that we had wished to raise by way of conclusion. It is hoped that it has been demonstrated in this article that to discuss collective agreements and seniority provisions is not to be involved in theoretical dissertations. Collective agreements and their seniority provisions, as well as their other provisions, are not only close to and part of, the work lives of hundreds of thousands of Canadians. They can also have an impact on the total of their lives. * The remarks contained in this article, are derived from a statement made by the author to theInstitute on Collective Bargaining of theRegistered Nurses' Association of Ontario (Toronto, November, 1968), are personal in nature and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Canada Department of Labour of which, at the time of the presentation of this statement, the author was an officer, nor do they necessarily reflect the Pay Research Bureau of which since July 1, 1969, the author is Assistant-Director (Research). 1 Importance of Collective Agreements in Canada — an address to the Richelieu Club of Hull (Que.), by Félix QUINET, January 16, 1968, pp. 3 - 4. 2 This figure is quoted fromImportance of Collective Agreements in Canada — an address to the Richelieu Club of Hull (Que.), by Félix QUINET, January 16, 1968, pp. 3 - 4. 3 It might perhaps be in order to suggest here that collective agreements may also make contributions in equally important contexts as that of the response to technological change. To illustrate this point, a couple of questions might be raised : When employees with a grievance realize that the complaints which they make are studied closely by an impartial arbitrator, because of the collective agreement, will these employees not have a very concrete and practical concept of the working of justice ? Is it unrealistic to believe that it is possible for a grievance procedure within a collective agreement applying to teachers, to facilitate in certain cases, the examination of questions which are intimately bound up with the salutary but delicate exercice of academic freedom ? Furthermore, is it far-fetched to think that, in certain cases, the workings of collective agreements concerning teachers could offer a concrete idea of the nature of academic freedom ? In our opinion, these are some of the unquestionably positive aspects of collective agreements that do not seem to receive their fair share of attention from the public to-day. 4 In this respect, it has often been argued that the ability of employees to transfer seniority-related rights and benefits from one bargaining unit to another would be encouraging a higher degree of labour mobility. It should indeed be borne in mind that an employee might think twice before moving to a better paid job and/or to a job more in line with his ability, if by moving, this employee would lose all seniority-related rights and benefits accumulated over the years.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of a field study at the Danish {{newspaper}} Politiken, the present thesis provides an insight into the ideals that the employees at the Danish newspaper have of how the teamwork between journalists and photographers should work, and how the teamwork functions in practice. Furthermore, the thesis will focus on which criteria and ideals the newspaper employees have specifically for photographs, and how these ideals and criteria match practice. This part of the study investigates the teamwork between journalists and photographers by analyzing their joint product. We approach a relatively unexplored area within the field of Journalism Studies; hence our study is conducted with an open mind with regard to its findings. The study is approached with a qualitative methodology, centring on important aspects of ‘Grounded Theory’. The thesis is based on a five-day field study at Politiken from April 19 th - 23 rd, 2010, including interviews with several employees of various age groups and <b>company</b> <b>seniority.</b> In this period, we have also observed the teamwork in practice by joining journalists and photographers on various corporate assignments. Finally, we convey a quantitative analysis of the photographs in the newspapers from our field study week – including the Saturday and Sunday issues. We apply Roland Barthes’s ‘Theory for Image Analysis’ and Pierre Bourdieu’s ‘Theory of Human Conduct’ as a theoretical frame of reference to our field study. These theories enable us to approach the visual aspect of the teamwork concerning the product and to recognise and understand the conditions of and conflict involved in human interaction. Based on a three-part analysis of the empirical material from our field study, we conclude that the teamwork between journalists and photographers can be optimized {{in many areas of the}} production process, especially in the planning and in editing phases. Consequently, we have made a list of seven potential ways in which Politiken can optimize the teamwork between journalists and photographers, among these that the journalist and photographer should jointly select photographs for the article. In this way they can create a more integrated and dynamic product. In this connection, the former chief editor at Politiken, Stig Kirk Ørskov, whom we have presented with our conclusions, finds that many of our recommendations could be very useful to Politiken in practice...|$|E
