40|$|Motivation is {{the set of}} {{processes}} that determine the choices people make about their behaviours. Implementing a well formulated motivation policy triggers the innate qualities of labourers (employees) by enhancing their productivity. This study investigates the drivers of motivation for <b>casual</b> <b>workers</b> on the construction sites by identifying the factors responsible for motivation and challenges to the motivation of <b>casual</b> <b>workers</b> in Nigerian construction industry. Relevant literature were reviewed and 18 -point evaluation questionnaire was developed on the drivers of motivation while 11 were collated for the challenges of motivation for <b>casual</b> <b>workers</b> on construction site. The questionnaires were then distributed to the professionals and labourers within construction sites in Lagos state, Nigeria. The data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The study indicates that <b>casual</b> <b>workers</b> give in their best when there are provisions of reward for the good work and excellence, also when they are adequately provided with working equipments and facilities {{and that there is}} {{no significant difference in the}} perception of labourers and professionals on the drivers and challenges of motivation for <b>casual</b> <b>workers</b> on construction site...|$|R

5000|$|His {{experiences}} as a school boy in wartime and his father's experiences at the car factory turned him against the idea of factory work: in 1923 Bleicher embarked on a traineeship as a baker. [...] In 1925 he joined the German Food and Confectionery Workers' Association, a forerunner of the Food, Beverages and Catering Union ("Gewerkschaft Nahrung-Genuss-Gaststätten" [...] / NGG). Within the union he was appointed to a position as [...] "youth leader" [...] in 1926. Around this time he also joined the Young Communists and the Communist Party. [...] After 1945, as a leading trades unionist in the Metal Workers' Union, Bleicher {{saw to it that}} very few people knew he had as a young man trained and qualified as a baker. There are suggestions that it might have been considered inappropriate to his image. For many colleagues and interlocutors it was only in 1992, several years after his death, that they learned of his baking qualifications from a biographical book by Hermann G. Abmayr [...] In 1927 Willi Bleich took work at the Daimler-Benz plant, working initially as a <b>casual</b> <b>worker</b> in the sales office and then joining the permanent payroll as an assistant in the foundry. It was probably in 1927 that he joined the German Metal Workers' Union ("Deutscher Metallarbeiter-Verband" [...] / DMV). [...] However, he soon lost his job, probably in May 1928: it is unclear whether this was on account of his political activities or for some other reason. Dismissal by the largest employer in the area was not helpful to his career prospects. However, he obtained work for around a year with [...] "Glasdach Zimmermann» of Untertürkheim. That came to an end on the middle of 1929 after which, till 1935, he was unemployed for most of the time, albeit with interludes of temporary work which included, for at least one stint, a chance to apply his bakery training.|$|E

40|$|The {{escalating}} casualisation of the Australian workforce {{appears to}} be accompanied by increasing worker resentment of the employment relationship. This paper examines the extent of psychological contract violations perceived by <b>casual</b> <b>workers.</b> It follows an earlier paper in this journal which revealed that <b>casual</b> <b>workers</b> experience low job satisfaction and that needs from the relational contract were not being met. That research also suggested that psychological contracts were being violated to the point where workers developed negative dispositions towards managers and their organisations. This paper extends the previous work by investigating the perceptions of a larger sample of <b>casual</b> <b>workers.</b> Results confirm the earlier research, and more significantly reveal, that violations were perceived across most of the investigated work dimensions...|$|R

30|$|There {{are also}} {{differences}} in transition probabilities by income (at the 10 % significant level) and by tenure. Workers with higher (monthly) income and higher tenure at their jobs {{are less likely}} to start another job as a private wage employee. In particular, those with higher tenure are more likely to move into self-employment. Interestingly, at the same time, we find that older workers are more likely to start another job in private employment, and less likely to find a job in government, as a <b>casual</b> <b>worker</b> or as a family worker.|$|E
3000|$|The main {{analysis}} of this paper relies on the last three waves (1997, 2000, 2007) of the Indonesian Familiy Life Survey (IFLS), a longitudinal survey on the individual, household, and community level. Besides its extremely low attrition rate (Strauss et al. 2009), the great advantage of the IFLS compared to datasets such as Sakernas is that it includes data on labor market outcomes for the self-employed. The data set for the employment regressions includes 48, 030 observations of 18, 825 active or inactive individuals (excluding students and sick or retired individuals) of working age (between 15 and 60 years) who appear at least twice in adjacent survey waves. Individuals are considered “active” if they report to be employed (as self-employed, government worker, private worker, unpaid family worker, <b>casual</b> <b>worker</b> in agriculture, <b>casual</b> <b>worker</b> not in agriculture) or mention “work” as their primary activity. On the contrary, individuals are inactive if they report a primary activity other than work 6 and neither report work status, or salary or profit. In addition to the classification in “active” and “inactive,” the reported work status helps us to categorize active individuals into “formal” or “informal.” That is, we distinguish formal from informal workers by employment type, i.e., classifying those workers as formal that are either private or government workers and as informal those workers who report “self-employed” or “unpaid family worker” as their working status. 7 [...]...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Health {{and safety}} {{sustainability}} {{is fundamental to}} the performance and growth of the construction industry {{as well as all}} other economic sectors globally. OSH offers a risk free and safe working environment with influence on productivity and as such Ws imperative for construction firms to provide and ensure compliance by all <b>workers</b> particularly <b>casual</b> <b>workers.</b> The study sought tofind out the perspective of <b>casual</b> <b>workers</b> on the compliance to occupational health and safety (OHS) practice in the Ghanaian construction industry as well as sustainable OSH strategies to improve the compliance level of <b>casual</b> <b>workers.</b> A structured interview questionnaire survey was used to collect data from <b>casual</b> <b>workers</b> on selected construction sites in Ghana. The study revealed a poor compliance to basic OHS regulations by <b>casual</b> <b>workers.</b> This was attributed to; unsafe attitudes and behaviour less education on health and safety 1 inadequate supply of personal protective equipment 1 less supervision and improper use of tools and equipment. Recommendation are made for the empowerment of the factories inspectorate and labour departments to effectively undertake their mandate under the law 1 the merger of all occupational safety and health policy documents into one single document is recommended and finally the passage of the construction industry bill to help regulate ensure strict compliance by industry players in the implementation of projects. In conclusion, strict compliance to OHS practice of <b>casual</b> <b>workers</b> should be ensured through close supervision at site; thus wearing a PPE must be a pre-requisite to access to site, safety education for workers should be undertaken as well as ensuring that occupational safety and health safety compliance declaration be considered a basic contractual requirement for the award of projects (at least for government of Ghanafunded projects) ...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{a unique}} matched firm-worker panel dataset between 2007 and 2009, {{empirical}} {{results show that}} export participation has {{a positive impact on}} wages when taking account of firm characteristics alone. However, exporter wage premium completely vanishes when both firm and worker characteristics are added simultaneously. This finding is also confirmed when controlling for time-invariant unobservable factors by spell fixed effect estimations. Furthermore, using a firm level balanced panel dataset in the same periods, the hypothesis of the positive role of export status on employment quality is rejected when it has a positive effect on the share of casual workers. However, this result is not robust across sectors and locations. Export participation continues to yield a positive impact on the share of <b>casual</b> <b>worker</b> in low tech sectors. However, a negative effect on employment quality is observed in high tech industries. The findings suggest that policies encouraging and supporting exporting should not only focus on the amount of employment created but also on the quality of employment, especially for low technology industries. ...|$|E

30|$|First, {{employment}} protection legislation {{is a set}} of rules that govern (a) termination of regular contracts, in case of individual and collective dismissals, and (b) hiring of employees on fixed-term contracts. The legal coverage data that we collected concern both types of regulations, and hence both types of workers—regular wage employees and wage employees holding fixed-term contracts. However, in many developing countries, but also recently in developed countries as well, total wage employment is not exhaustively measured as a sum of regular and fixed-term employees, and other categories, such as <b>casual</b> <b>workers,</b> additionally exist. According to the 1993 Resolution concerning the International Classification of Status in Employment, 7 <b>casual</b> <b>workers</b> are defined as persons “who have an explicit or implicit contract of employment which is not expected to continue for more than a short period, whose duration is to be determined by national circumstance.” As shown by De Stefano (2016), in the majority of countries, these workers are totally or partially excluded from labor protection, either de jure, or de facto. One country that particularly stands out in this regard is Australia. In this country, <b>casual</b> <b>workers</b> are explicitly excluded by law from EPL provisions. We thus also excluded them from computation of de jure coverage. In other countries, as shown by De Stefano (2016), the law is less clear cut and may exclude <b>casual</b> <b>workers</b> from some of the provisions or contain special provisions for them. Thus, we do not exclude <b>casual</b> <b>workers</b> from computing de jure coverage in all other countries, though de facto, {{they are likely to be}} excluded.|$|R
