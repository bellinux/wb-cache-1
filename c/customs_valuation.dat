Authors: Anne Benedicks and Veronica Öberg Advisor: Eron Oxing Profession of category: Financial analysts, auditors and company lawyers. Key words: Company valuation, valuation methods, cash flow analysis, comparative valuation, the net asset value method. The Main Issue: What is of decisive importance when choosing a special company valuation method? Purpose: The {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify, analyse and evaluate the most common methods of valuation for financial analysts, auditors and company lawyers and those factors that influences the choice of method. Method: A multiple survey has been implemented for the actual profession categories. Primary data was collected through semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire survey. Theoretical: The theoretical frame of reference is based upon the paper’s dependent variable, i. e. the role of the appraiser. The appraiser is dependent of following undependent variables: comparative valuation of company, situations of valuation, relevant information, the processes of valuation, the methods of <b>valuation</b> and common <b>custom</b> <b>valuation.</b> Empiricism: Material from the interviews and the questionnaire survey shows how the professional category respectively acts when they valuate a company and why and which valuation method is used. According to the interviews the financial analysts often uses comparative evaluation, the auditor uses the cash flow analysis while the lawyer chooses the net asset value method. Conclusion: The result of this paper considerable agrees to earlier research within the field. The main underlying factor for the appraiser to choose a certain evaluation method is simply depending on the actual situation. Example of other determining factors is customer relations, access to relevant information and which type of business under evaluation. Yrkesgrupper: Finansanalytiker, revisorer och jurister. Problemformulering: Vad är avgörande för att en specifik företagsvärderingsmetod väljs? Syfte: Syftet med uppsatsen är att identifiera, analysera och utvärdera vilka de vanligast förekommande värderingsmetoderna är för finansanalytiker, revisorer och jurister samt vilka faktorer som påverkar valet av metod. Metod: En flerfallstudie har gjorts hos de berörda yrkeskategorierna. Primärdata samlades in genom semistrukturerade intervjuer samt enkätundersökning. Teoretisk referensram: Den teoretiska referensramen utgår från uppsatsens beroende variabel, värderarens roll. De oberoende variabler som värderaren är beroende av är: relativ företagsvärdering, värderingssituationer, informationskällor, värderingsprocessen, värderingsmetoder och god värderingssed. Empiri: Material från intervjuer och enkätundersökning visar på hur respektive yrkeskategori handlar i en företagsvärderingssituation samt varför och med vilken värderingsmetod. Enligt intervjuerna använder finansanalytikern oftast jämförande värdering, revisorn väljer kassaflödesanalys medan juristen väljer substansvärdemetoden. Slutsats: Uppsatsens resultat överensstämmer på ett bra sätt med tidigare forskning inom området. Den största bakomliggande faktorn till att värderaren väljer en viss värderingsmetod beror oftast på situationen. Exempel på andra avgörande element är relationen till kunden, tillgång till information samt vilken typ av företag som ska värderas...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the start}} of tourism as {{rewarding}} and massive activity in the mid-nineteenth century, the traditional urban systems of the Spanish coast have been transformed to satisfy an increasingly changeable and demanding typology of tourist. Among the different models of urban development {{that have taken place}} so far, this study examines the phenomenon of New Holiday Towns: New Towns planned for mass tourism, with an own identity and certain degree of economic and/or political autonomy. These ex-novo settlements are built over tabula rasa and based on a large scale, master plan with an independent urban structure, thanks to strong business investment and the support and commitment from local government. The keys to success: leisure as a consumer product and an efficient marketing. The objective {{of this paper is to}} reflect on this model of tourist development that is spreading internationally. For this, firstly the economic, social and political reality that facilitates its emergence and subsequent development was studied. A few cases of New Holiday Towns were studied chronologically, noting the notable difference between the first appeared and the current ones. And finally, a sociological study was carried out in a specific case: Marina d'Or, in the municipality of Oropesa del Mar, Castell 3 n.

40|$|PhDThe {{purpose of}} this thesis is to reform <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> law and VAT on {{importation}} of goods under trends in trade globalisation, using Thailand as the example. To achieve this purpose, a number of related topics (e. g. the 'notional' and 'positive' concepts of value, international <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> systems - the Brussels Definition of Value and the WTO <b>Customs</b> <b>Valuation</b> Agreement the destination and origin principles, VAT on importation, and the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)) are brought to analysis in a comprehensive way. The research findings indicate that the existing system of <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> in Thailand is arbitrary and constitutes a significant barrier to trade. Such problems will be reduced (or eliminated) under the new <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> legislation, based on the WTO <b>Customs</b> <b>Valuation</b> Agreement. However, {{the system of the}} WTO <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> is complicated, creating some difficulties for developing countries like Thailand to apply. In this connection, co-operation among ASEAN customs administrations should be enhanced. The 'regional minimum values' should also be applied for determining the customs value where the transactions within the ASEAN region are between related parties. With regard to VAT on importation, it is found that, in the two countries (the UK and Thailand) surveyed, there is no particular problem inherent in the destination-based VAT. Most problems relate to the administration as well as the base of VAT on importation in Thailand. Reforms on these matters have to be undertaken unilaterally and voluntarily to improve prospects for attracting foreign investment and increasing trade.

40|$|Transfer {{pricing and}} <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> rules, are both {{ultimately}} aimed at ensuring a transaction with an associated enterprise or related party is conducted at arm?s length. The {{literature on the}} intersection of these rules has identified, on the one hand, the potential for double taxation and, on the other hand, exploitation {{of the differences in}} these regimes by taxpayers. After identifying the obstacles to harmonisation of <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> and transfer pricing rules and the opportunities for applying these rules in a harmonised way (in order to manage the risks associate with these rules), this mini-dissertation critically analyses the South African income tax and customs legislation and evaluates it by way of a case study based on the author?s recent experience. This analysis and case study illustrates that in general transfer pricing documentation cannot be used to show that the transaction value of the imported goods is arm?s length and that the prospects for harmonisation of transfer pricing and <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> rules in South Africa are poor. The means of managing the transfer pricing and <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> risks identified in the existing literature and the case study are further analysed to identify whether they are feasible in South Africa. It is established that importers should incorporate information relevant to customs authorities in their transfer pricing documentation and use provisional declarations where future transfer pricing adjustments are expected. The importer should also evaluate its transfer prices continually in order to avoid year-end transfer pricing adjustments. Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

40|$|This master thesis {{intends to}} examine the tension between {{transfer}} pricing and <b>customs</b> <b>valuation,</b> showing how transfer pricing, {{in the context of}} corporate income taxation, and <b>customs</b> <b>valuation,</b> in the context of tariffs, are two realities that share a common starting point – the pursuant towards the achievement and corroboration of the arm’s length principle – but incorporate critical differences and inconsistencies. After summarily describing the theoretical highlights behind the structure of each discipline, we perform an in-depth comparative analysis on the interactions between transfer pricing and <b>customs</b> <b>valuation,</b> exploiting the issues that arise from the lack of convergence between these two systems, which might act as a burden for the taxpayer / importer and be a source of situations of double taxation. The work developed led us to the conclusion that convergence and harmonization is a desirable and necessary step. While concluding that a full convergence would be difficult to implement mainly due to structural focus and timing differences, an acceptable degree of convergence would be reached based on three main foundations: the harmonization of the mechanism of choice of method, the mitigation of timing and focus differences and the clarification of the process of reflecting post importation transfer pricing adjustment at the customs level...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis is to examine and analyse how a {{transfer}} pricing adjustment is made and how related parties should handle price adjustments from a customs perspective in Sweden. The examination includes describing the valuation methods available for transfer pricing and <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> with regards to related parties. In addition, the differences in connection to the valuation are described and analysed. Goods imported to Sweden must be cleared through customs: the importer presents a customs declaration to the Swedish Customs and pays customs duty. The customs duty is calculated using a customs value and <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> is the system that enables the importer to establish correct customs values on imported goods. Transfer pricing is the determination of prices on transactions taken place between companies belonging to the same group and has a direct effect on the income tax payable. There are six <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> methods that are hierarchically applied and six transfer pricing methods that are applied somewhat differently. There are similarities between the methods {{and most of the}} <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> methods have a corresponding transfer pricing method, or vice versa. Even if there are similarities, many factors make reconciliation of the methods difficult. Such factors are the different time for assessing the value and that the <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> methods are applied in a strictly hierarchical way with no possibility to choose the most suitable method. Customs duties and transfer pricing both share the same valuation concept, although interpreted differently, being that the value shall be based on the price that the parties would arrive at under open market conditions. However, relevant values on the same transaction differ significantly due to trying to be in accordance with respective rules. The differences in expectations and the conflicting interests on the outcome of the valuation lead to problems in the tax field. As a conclusion, <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> and transfer pricing can undeniably be described as “the two opposing and necessary sides of the same ‘coin’, whose respective values unavoidably affect the whole balance of a system of closely connected valuation”. In order for related parties to use the transaction value method, which is the superior <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> method, the price must not have been influenced due to their relationship. If one of two tests prescribed by law can prove that the relationship has not influenced the price, the related parties can use the transaction value method to establish the customs value. If the transaction value, for some reason cannot be used, the importer has to address other options on to how to establish the customs value. The conclusion of this master’s thesis is that related parties should include a price review clause in their contract or pricing policy. The company should notify the Swedish Customs about the provisional price and make an incomplete customs declaration. When information enabling the calculation of the customs value is available, the importer should file a complementary declaration. As an alternative, the importer should declare an open claim to the Swedish Customs arguing that the transaction value cannot be applied and, as a consequence thereof, explain in the customs value declaration why the applied customs value is correct. This thesis provides three recommendations concerning {{how to deal with the}} complications of <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> and transfer pricing. The first recommendation is that rules and recommendations surrounding transfer pricing and <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> should, to the extent possible, be harmonised. The second recommendation is that co-operation between the Swedish Tax Agency and the Swedish Customs must improve, for example through advance pricing arrangements for both transfer pricing and customs purposes, documentation requirements, and joint audits. The third recommendation is that related parties should take the same care and documentation approach for customs purposes as it does for transfer pricing. Importing companies should make a price review clause in their contract before the importation and present an incomplete customs declaration. This way, in case of adjustments, the related party is able to uphold an arm’s length standard on the price and has the possibility to use the preferred transaction value for customs purposes, if that is desirable...|$|E

40|$|This study {{documents}} some {{unintended consequences}} of the World Trade Organization (WTO) membership by providing evidence on displacement of tariff evasion driven by the WTO accession process. The analysis focuses on the WTO <b>Customs</b> <b>Valuation</b> Agreement (CVA) which limits the discretion of customs officials {{when it comes to}} assessing the price of imports. While prior to the WTO accession customs officials are free to use their own judgment or apply minimum or reference prices, after their country joined the WTO they are mandated to accept the invoice price issued by the exporter. If customs officials enjoy discretion with respect to assessing the import price, they may assist importers with tariff evasion in exchange for bribes. Removing such discretion limits their ability to facilitate misrepresentation of import prices. Using data on 15 countries which joined the WTO between 1996 and 2008, we find a positive relationship between underreporting of import prices and the tariff rate, which is expected as the incentive to evade increases with the tariff rate. Importantly, this relationship disappears after a country joins the WTO. This result is consistent with the CVA closing one channel for corrupt behavior. However, we also find that changes to <b>customs</b> <b>valuation</b> procedures induce importers to seek alternative ways of tariff evasion, such as underreporting of quantities and product misclassification.
