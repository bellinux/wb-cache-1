40|$|Certifying tourism {{businesses}} as sustainable {{has been}} proposed {{as a means to}} connect the academic goals of ecotourism to the industry. One obstacle that impedes the development of widely recognized sustainable tourism <b>certifications</b> is the lack of knowledge regarding consumer preferences for these <b>certifications.</b> A better understanding of consumer desires is needed in order to create sustainable tourism <b>certifications</b> that will generate price premiums for certified businesses and thus accelerate the growth of certified businesses. This study uses a stated-preference choice modeling approach to examine consumer preference for sustainable tourism <b>certifications</b> amongst international tourists in Tanzania. Results suggest that <b>certifications</b> that emphasize environmental sustainability are more important to tourists than <b>certifications</b> that emphasize cultural or economic sustainability. Additionally, the more stringent <b>certifications</b> provide relatively little increase in consumer utility. The implications of the findings on the development of sustainable tourism <b>certifications</b> are discussed...|$|R
