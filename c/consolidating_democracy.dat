Common sense {{suggests}} that the more <b>consolidated</b> <b>democracies</b> and advanced economies tend to be more efficient and produce smaller States. What is observed in practice, however, is a positive correlation between "democratic consolidation" and "tax burden" (as a proxy for"size of Government"). This finding, while not expressing any causal relationship between the two variables, is an evidence that a more republican and democratic State, as defined in Bresser-Pereira, must be able to provide, effectively and efficiently, broader public services with better quality. This is, in <b>consolidated</b> <b>democracies,</b> the State should not be small...|$|R
5000|$|An {{embedded}} {{democracy can}} be considered a type of <b>consolidated</b> <b>democracy,</b> meaning that the democratic regime in an embedded democracy is seen as legitimate and stable. Political scientists debate the definition of democratic consolidation, but at minimum, a <b>consolidated</b> <b>democracy</b> is entrenched so that democracy is considered [...] "the only game in town." [...] Some scholars, like Merkel, take a maximalist approach to defining <b>consolidated</b> <b>democracy</b> by specifying the partial regimes of consolidation. Gunther considers three dimensions of consolidation—institutional, attitudinal, and behavioral—while Linz and Stepan highlight five arenas for consolidation: civil society, political society, rule of law, the state apparatus and economic society.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{illustrate}} Serbia’s democratic development on the basis of consolidate democratic perspective. Linz & Stepan´s five arenas (political, civil, economic, legal and bureaucratic) are required for the possibility to become a <b>consolidate</b> <b>democracy.</b> In order to fulfil the aim, I have chosen to focus on the political and civil arenas that are most central in the study of <b>consolidate</b> <b>democracy.</b> The {{purpose of this}} study is to process how far Serbia has come towards a <b>consolidate</b> <b>democracy</b> and which obstacles still remain in the transition. The questions in this study are: • What problems has Serbia faced since the democratic transition in the beginning of 1990 ? • What possibilities are there for Serbia to <b>consolidate</b> the <b>democracy,</b> with focus on the two key arenas of consolidation? By applying the theoretical framework to the data, I have been able to present answers and build up an analysis. As the analysis shows, Serbia has come a long way since the transition faze. Still there are a lot obstacles and further improvements are necessary before the country can finish the transition faze and become a <b>consolidate</b> <b>democracy.</b> Keywords: Serbia, democracy, consolidation, civil society, political society, human right...|$|R

The lack of studies concerning <b>consolidated</b> <b>democracies</b> 2 ̆ 7 use of historical memory raises many questions, including whether <b>consolidated</b> <b>democracies</b> manipulate historical memory for the purpose of legitimacy? I contend that, similar to Wang 2 ̆ 7 s findings, elites within <b>consolidated</b> <b>democracies</b> manipulate historical memory for the purpose of enhancing party legitimacy and that the concept of historical memory is a tool that continues to be utilized by elites after consolidation.

The purpose of this essay is on the basis of consolidate democratic perspective to illustrate Croatia’s democratic development. In order to fulfil the aim, I have applied a qualitative text analysis technique. Through analysis of books and documents, data was collected to accommodate a valid result. I have used <b>consolidated</b> <b>democracy,</b> with its five areas (political, civil, economic, legal and bureaucratic), as my theoretical framework to the data, to provide answers and develop an analysis. The conclusions show that the <b>consolidate</b> <b>democracy</b> in Croatia has developed a lot since the independence, and Croatia is on its good way to turn into a democratic state like other West-European countries. Croatia has developed and is still developing their political, civil, economic, legal and bureaucratic areas. A good sign of their democratic development is that Croatia received status as a candidate country in June 2005 for European Union, which shows that Croatia is on the way to complete its transition to <b>consolidated</b> <b>democracy...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of scholarly consideration {{on the principles}} of transitional justice has focused upon how emerging democracies should deal with former regimes immediately following violent conflict. However, <b>consolidated</b> <b>democracies</b> have also begun to turn to transitional justice mechanisms in order to address historical legacies of violence and repression. This article examines Spain and Canada, two countries dealing with seemingly disparate issues: the legacy of the Civil War and Franco’s repressive regime, and the abuses of the Indian Residential Schools system, respectively. However, both nations have been forced to respond to similar questions regarding the merits of revisiting a painful past well after democratic consolidation. The article first discusses the proliferation of transitional justice principles into <b>consolidated</b> <b>democracies,</b> and considers the argument that such processes may destabilize and divide society, particularly by exacerbating federalist divisions. It concludes that despite the unique challenges of employing transitional justice so long after a transition, the Spanish and Canadian cases reveal the inevitability of confronting the past in response to charges of hypocrisy and illegitimacy. <b>Consolidated</b> <b>democracies,</b> embedded with principles of public contention and debate, are well-suited to respond to these challenges while maintaining political and societal cohesion...|$|R

These were attributed to the political violence and the covert war between suspected extrajudicial right-wing forces and the URNG. On May 9 another attempted coup failed, and though the perpetrators were sentenced to long terms in jail that November, they were released on appeal the following January. On August 1 Danilo Barillas, the Secretary General of the DCG was assassinated, but on August 25 Cerezo came back with a new promise to renovate the public administration by <b>consolidating</b> <b>democracy</b> within 500 days (the time he had left in power); which he managed to achieve as we see democracy still stands to this day on Guatemala.|$|E
50|$|Finally, the PSOE had to {{deal with}} the issue of {{military}} insurrectionism as well. The Spanish Armed Forces were profoundly reorganized: the position of Chief of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JUJEM), which itself underwent internal reforms (including a full renovation of all of its members), was subordinated to the newly created Chief of the Defence Staff (JEMAD), in turn directly responsible to the Defence Minister, promoting an increase of civil authority over the military. It also passed into law two bills that provided, on the one hand, a reduction in the number of high-ranking officers (which was considered oversized), also allowing for long-serving officers to retire in exchange of economic incentives; on the other hand, a 15% increase in wages for members of the Armed Forces, equating military wages to the level of those from civil service personnel with similar responsibilities. Finally, the three armies (Army, Navy and Air Force) were integrated within the organizational and functional structure of the Ministry of Defence. With these reforms the Socialists intended to professionalise the Armed Forces and end the threat of military coup attempts that had lingered during the previous year, with the ultimate goal of <b>consolidating</b> <b>democracy</b> in Spain.|$|E

In 1999 Croatia’s president died and this was the start of a new era in Croatian politics. In 2000 the ruling party was defeated by a coalition which immediately begun to integrate Croatia with the European Union and in essence started to consolidate democracy. ...|$|E
