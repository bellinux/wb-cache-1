40|$|A non-stationary polar gap model first {{proposed}} by Ruderman & Sutherland (1975) is modified {{and applied to}} spark-associated pulsar emission at radio wave-lengths. It is argued that under physical and geometrical conditions prevailing above pulsar polar cap, highly non-stationary spark discharges do not occur at random positions. Instead, sparks should tend to operate in well determined preferred regions. At any instant the polar cap is populated as densely as possible {{with a number of}} two-dimensional sparks with a characteristic dimension as well as a typical distance between adjacent sparks being about the polar gap height. Our model differs, however, markedly from its original 'hollow cone' version. The key feature is the quasi-central spark driven by pair production process and anchored to the local pole of a sunspot-like surface magnetic field. This fixed spark prevents the motion of other sparks towards the pole, restricting it to slow <b>circumferential</b> <b>drift</b> across the planes of field lines converging at the local pole. We argue that the polar spark constitutes the core pulsar emission, and that the annular rings of drifting sparks contribute to conal components of the pulsar beam. We found that the number of nested cones in the beam of typical pulsar should not excced three; a number also found by Mitra & Deshpande (1999) using a completely different analysis.
