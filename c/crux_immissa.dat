5000|$|The authors {{say there}} were two {{possible}} ways of erecting the stauros, which {{would probably have been}} not much higher than the height of a man. The condemned man could be fastened to the cross lying on the ground at the place of execution, then lifted up on it. Alternatively, it was probably usual to have the stake implanted in the ground before the execution. The victim was tied to the crosspiece and was hoisted up with the horizontal beam and made fast to the vertical stake. They say that as this was the simpler form of erection, and the carrying of the crossbeam (patibulum) was probably a form of punishment for slaves, the crux commissa may be taken as the normal practice. :1. stauros is an upright stake. ...:2. stauros is an instrument of torture for serious offences, Plut.
