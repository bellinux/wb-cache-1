5|$|Adidas Terrestra Silverstream was the {{official}} match ball {{used in the}} final. It was assembled and marketed by German sport firm Adidas, and was the ninth ball in the European Championship series, as well {{as part of the}} Adidas Finale. The ball's design was created by British independent brand specialist company Design Bridge, and influenced by the waters, in the Netherlands and Belgium. The ball contains synthetic foam layers, making it more <b>comfortable</b> <b>to</b> grip and smoother to control. The Terrestra Silverstream was later unveiled as {{the official}} match ball of the UEFA Euro 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, journalists, {{eager to}} sensationalize {{the events of}} the Great Fire, were quick to find in Mrs. Kate O'Leary an easy {{scapegoat}} for the calamitous inferno. As a working-class immigrant and a woman, Kate O'Leary was an easy target for those publications who always found it <b>comfortable</b> <b>to</b> vilify Irish Catholics who had not yet assimilated into the dominant American middle-class culture.|$|E
5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less <b>comfortable</b> <b>to</b> breathe in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} Siddharth {{was because of}} the sheer {{relevance}} to the character in real life. However, they finalized the choice of the actor only after the script was ready. The choice of Genelia was based on her natural vivacity in real life. This and her eyes, according to Bhaskar, made her an obvious choice for her character. More so, she liked the one line story that Raju told and also a few scenes that he narrated to her. She immediately liked the character and consented for the role. The fact that her co-actor, Siddharth and she acted earlier together in Boys (2003), made them more <b>comfortable</b> <b>to</b> work with. The camaraderie that the lead actors shared during the filming, added to their good performances. The choice of Prakash Raj was easy as he befitted the character he portrayed while, Jayasudha was persuaded {{to play the role of}} the lead actor's mother.|$|E

However, the road tests were encouraging, and even with no rear suspension the machine was more manoeuvrable and <b>comfortable</b> <b>to</b> ride than a traditional motorcycle.|$|E

25|$|Since {{entering}} the tractor business in 1918, John Deere had focused on two-cylinder machines. The New Generation of Power introduced at Deere Day in Dallas {{was very different}} from anything Deere had built before. The new line of four- and six-cylinder tractors, the models 1010, 2010, 3010, and 4010, were more far more powerful than Deere's two-cylinder models, and also easier and more <b>comfortable</b> <b>to</b> operate, with conveniently located controls, better visibility, and improved seat suspension. These new tractors were also easier to service.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{paper and}} e-paper are display devices that mimic the {{appearance}} of ordinary ink on paper. Unlike conventional backlit flat panel displays that emit light, electronic paper displays reflect light like paper. This may make them more <b>comfortable</b> <b>to</b> read, and provide a wider viewing angle than most light-emitting displays. The contrast ratio in electronic displays available as of 2008 approaches newspaper, and newly (2008) developed displays are slightly better. An ideal e-paper display can be read in direct sunlight without the image appearing to fade.|$|E
