40|$|In {{relation}} to a possible <b>cable</b> <b>pathway</b> on the sea floor through the inner half of the Hardanger fjord, the Institute for Marine Research has carried out ROV inspections of the benthic faunal communities along 17 selected bottom transects. The surveyed area was restricted to the inner half of the Hardanger fjord – from Sima to Norheimsund in the period 9 – 29 November 2010. The deep horizontal seabed along the midline of the investigated part of the fjord was dominated by the crustacean Munida sp and its borrow, the sea cucumbers Bathyplotes sp and Stichopous sp, sea-pens, and the echiuran Bonellia sp. The steep walls {{along the sides of}} the investigated fjord were populated with less abundant but still relatively frequently-occurring taxa such the sea star Brisingia sp, the large bivalve Acesta sp, and several species of sponges. Though any local recovery time is unknown, we do not consider these populations to be threatened by the possible cable-laying activities. These are not listed in the Norwegian redlist and are not considered as threatened by the OSPAR Convention. However, in the outer part of the investigated area (transects named Kvamsøy cliff wall and Øystese), the vulnerable corals Lophelia pertusa and Anthomastus grandiflorus (redlisted) and Primnoa sp were observed. To avoid threatening impacts to these groups of corals, we therefore recommend using video monitoring during any cable-laying activities...|$|E

Seafloor geology and benthic biological data were analyzed in conjunction with seafloor core sample geostatistical interpolation to locate suitable substrates for OCE anchoring. Existing submarine <b>cable</b> <b>pathways</b> were considered to determine pathways for power transmission cables that circumvent biologically sensitive areas.

40|$|The {{administration}} of telecommunications {{is critical to}} proper maintenance and operation. The intent {{is to be able}} to properly support telecommunications for the distribution of all information within a building/campus. This standard will provide a uniform administration scheme that is independent of applications, and will establish guidelines for owners, installers, designers and contractors. This standard will accommodate existing building wiring, new building wiring and outside plant wiring. Existing buildings may not readily adapt to all applications of this standard, but the requirement for telecommunications administration is applicable to all buildings. Administration of the telecommunications infrastructure includes documentation (labels, records, drawings, reports, and work orders) of cables, termination hardware, patching and cross-connect facilities, telecommunications rooms, and other telecommunications spaces (conduits, grounding, and <b>cable</b> <b>pathways</b> are documented by Facilities Engineering). The investment in properly documenting telecommunications is a worthwhile effort. It is necessary to adhere to these standards to ensure quality and efficiency for the operation and maintenance of the telecommunications infrastructure for Sandia National Laboratories...|$|R

Existing submarine <b>cable</b> <b>pathways</b> were considered to determine pathways for power transmission cables that circumvent biologically sensitive areas. Suitability analysis indicates that areas east of the Miami Terrace and north of recently identified deep-sea coral mounds are the most appropriate for OCE siting due to abundance of sand/sediment substrate, existing underwater cable route access, and minimal biological presence (i. e., little to no benthic communities). Further reconnaissance requires higher resolution maps of geological substrate and benthic community locations to identify specific OCE development locations, classify benthic conditions, and minimize potentially negative OCE environmental impacts...|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{morphogenesis}} {{is crucial}} {{for the development of}} metazoans. C. elegans, is a model system for studying tissue morphogenesis, as there are many genetic tools available, and embryos are amenable to microscopy. We study ventral enclosure, which is the process where ventral epidermal cells migrate to enclose the C. elegans embryo in a single layer of epidermal cells. This process is initiated by the migration and adhesion of two pairs of anterior leading cells, followed by the migration and adhesion of eight pairs of posterior pocket cells. The migration of the leading cells is mediated by F-actin rich filopodia-like protrusions, which are {{under the control of the}} Rac – Wave/Scar – Arp 2 / 3 <b>pathway.</b> <b>Cables</b> of F-actin become enriched around the margins of the pocket cells to form a ring, and early studies showed that this ring is under tension. Based on this data, actomyosin contractility was predicted to mediate the closure of this ring during ventral enclosure. However, nonmuscle myosin has not been studied in ventral enclosure, where it could regulate ring closure in addition to regulating cell shape changes and/or adhesion. For example, proteins that form adhesion junction complexes are also required for ventral enclosure, as they maintain contacts between cells so they can migrate as a unit and form new junctions with contralateral neighbors. Our studies support a role for myosin contractility in ventral enclosure. RhoA regulates nonmuscle myosin contractility for cytokinesis in the early embryo and for elongation of the lateral epidermal cells in late embryogenesis. ECT- 2 is the GEF that activates RhoA during cytokinesis, and a different GEF, RHGF- 2, activates RhoA during late embryogenesis. A hypomorphic, maternal ts allele of ect- 2, ax 751, is required for polarity in the early embryo, but displays few cytokinesis defects, especially at non-permissive temperatures. Using this allele, we found that ect- 2 is required for the migration of neuroblasts during earlier embryonic stages, and ventral epidermal cells during ventral enclosure. Genetic crosses suggest that ect- 2 functions in parallel to the Rac pathway and may be part of the Rho pathway to regulate actomyosin contractility, supporting a role for myosin in ventral enclosure. Imaging and quantification of embryos expressing GFP-tagged myosin showed that myosin forms into a supracellular structure around the margins of the ventral pocket cells, reminiscent of the actin ring described previously. We found that ect- 2 is required for the enrichment and organization of myosin, supporting a requirement for ect- 2 in regulating myosin contractility. Interestingly, ect- 2 may also function in the cadherin/catenin pathway that forms adhesion junctions, suggesting ect- 2 could also regulate the actomyosin filaments that contribute to adhesion. ...|$|R
