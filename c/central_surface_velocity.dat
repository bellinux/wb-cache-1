40|$|The {{mass balance}} of Antarctica varies a lot {{across the whole}} continent. While some areas show {{evidence}} of a clear deficit in mass balance, for instance the Antarctic Peninsula, the difference between accumulation and ablation in other areas seems to be small and even the sign is not evident. While ice thickness and <b>surface</b> <b>velocities</b> can be determined by means of remote sensing, radio-echo sounding and satellite picture interferometry, accumulation and ablation have to be measured in-situ using snow pits, firn/ice cores, and depth sounders under ice shelves or in ice sheets. Remote sensing techniques can be easily applied for large areas while in-situ measurements will always be restricted to isolated point measurements and therefore are of limited areal density. During the pre-site survey for the EPICA drill site in Dronning Maud Land (DML) the ice tickness of several drainage basins in this region have been mapped using airborne radio-echo sounding (RES). Eventhough this pre-site survey has been concentrated on the interior part of DML the coastal region has been mapped {{as well as on}} the way into the interior. These by-product measurements have been completed throughout the three past austral summers up to austral summer 2003 / 04 by profiles along the ground line and across several distinct outlet glacier of west and <b>central</b> DML. <b>Surface</b> <b>velocities</b> could be elaborated using ERS 1 / 2 satellite images. The contribution will be geographically restricted on the Vestraumen, an outlet glacier in West DML, draining into the western part of the Riiser-Larsenisen, and focus on ice sheet properties of the drainage baisin and the ice stream derived from remote sensing techniques.

These changes include accelerations in <b>surface</b> ice <b>velocity,</b> and are related {{to a number of}} glaciological and physical processes, including increased calving, changes in ice stream margins, terminus retreat, and glacial thinning. While there is available data on current <b>surface</b> <b>velocities</b> for outlet glaciers in Greenland, including satellite-derived velocity measurements and ground-based observations, pre- 1990 flow velocity field and structure estimates are not as widely available.

First, the total flow 2 ̆ 7 rate was measured using current meters and calculated cross-sectional flow area. Second, the <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> was measured using four trials of the float method, and the average float travel time was calculated for each location and measurement instance. The measurements were taken on different days for various water depths in the canals. Third, the surface and mean cross-sectional velocities were divided, yielding the <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> coefficient, for every measurement {{at each of the}} five locations. Several channel bed elevations were also measured near each location along a distance of 100 m or more, as necessary, to define the average longitudinal bed slope. Linear equations and averages were developed from the relationship between the velocity ratios and critical depth, and between those ratios and the measured water depths. Finally, the approximate cross-sectional velocity profiles for several of the measurement instances were produced using GIS software. All the steps mentioned above were followed to determine <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> coefficients for use with the float method. The results in the five locations show that the coefficients are not proportional to the water depth variation, and that the presence of rocks and sediment in the channel bed affect the coefficient values. Consequently, the development of a linear relation among coefficients to correct the <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> obtained from float method was difficult to obtain from the available data. In the five measurement locations, the <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> coefficients vary from 0. 33 to 0. 81 and the measured water depths during the period of evaluation were from 0. 16 m to 0. 53 m.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 Observations {{of surface}} motion and ice {{deformation}} from 2002 - 2003 {{were used to}} infer seasonal stress distributions in a cross-section of Black Rapids Glacier. During periods in summer, basal shear stresses in a well-defined zone 500 m north of the centerline were redistributed to the glacier margins, as inferred by a simple inverse model that incorporates a 2 D finite element flow model. The flow model can also reproduce the high <b>surface</b> <b>velocities</b> associated with the rapid drainage of marginal lakes if the well-defined zone north of the centerline is decoupled from the bed {{as a result of}} high water pressure. This zone is highly susceptible to changes in water influx, owing to a localization of the drainage system and/or to a weak zone in the till. These results suggest that <b>surface</b> <b>velocities</b> are strongly controlled by the basal stress distribution, and therefore water pressure distribution, over large parts of the glacier bed.

40|$|The {{measurement}} and monitoring of glacial <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> {{is important for}} many aspects of glaciology, such as determining the mass balance, for characterising the stability or instability of glaciers, or the identification of potential hazards from surging glaciers or Jökulhlaups, a type of glacial outburst flood. Predominately measurements of glacial <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> have been produced using either differential interferometry (DInSAR) applied to radar data, or offset-tracking applied to either optical or radar data. Both of these methods have their own set of limitations, notably the one-dimensional nature of DInSAR measurements, and the relatively low accuracy of offset-tracking. Instead using DInSAR and multiple-aperture interferometry (MAI) applied to ERS- 1 / 2 Tandem SAR data, measurements of glacial surface displacements were obtained in the line-of-sight (LOS) and along-track directions respectively. Then using a weighted-least squares adjustment, the method for producing the full three-dimensional <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> field is presented and applied to the Svartisen glacial system, Norway and the Petermann Glacier, Greenland. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} applying such a method were explored, of which interferometric coherence is found to be the largest factor in retrieving accurate measurements using MAI. Low interferometric coherence due to temporal decorrelation resulted in the inability to extract the full three-dimensional <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> field over the Bagley Icefield, Alaska, and the Mýrdalsjökull & Eýjafjallajökull ice caps, Iceland. A feasibility analysis into the use of Sentinel- 1 data, revealed that the current revisit period is too large to maintain interferometric coherence between acquisitions, preventing the application of either DInSAR or offset-tracking in order to measure the <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> of the Blåmannsisen Glacier, Norway. Despite the limitations encountered, in part due to the selection of source data, MAI in tandem with DInSAR {{has been shown to be}} capable of measuring the three-dimensional <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> to a higher accuracy than offset-tracking when coherence is high.

Since glacier beds are mostly inaccessible, numerical inversion of the <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> field provides a valuable method for calculating the basal shear stress and sliding velocity. However, previous theoretical studies (limited either to planar slabs or linear ice rheology) have suggested small errors in <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> measurements lead to large uncertainties in calculated basal sliding.
