40|$|The European hake {{is one of}} {{the major}} commercially {{important}} species in Western Europe fisheries. Currently its management is divided into different functional units in the Mediterranean (GFCM, General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean) and two stocks in the Atlantic: the Southern and the Northern Stock. The basis for the definition of this management stock structure is under permanent discussion and in the latest years there were an increased amount of genetic studies addressing this topic. Integrated ecosystem assessment requires an improved understanding of the marine ecosystem to provide an effective advice. To this end we have gathered hake genetic information from different studies with the aim of developing a spatial assessment model that links the current stocks. These studies show a restricted gene flow between Southern hake and Mediterranean hake, although a smaller genetic distance between Southern and Northern stocks than one expected from two independent populations, suggesting the presence of a major gene flow from northern grounds <b>core</b> <b>stock</b> (Porcupine and Great Sole Banks) towards the Bay of Biscay and the northwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula. However the quantitative implementation of genetic metrics (such as Fst, migration rates, etc) into population dynamic models is not straightforward given the different nature and assumptions behind these different approaches. In this work we discuss the problems to link these different disciplines suggesting ways to overcome them. These include ways to improve future genetic sampling and developing plausible scenarios for genetic connectivity in population dynamic models...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore whether, and to what extent, the {{incidence}} of war affects the migration intensity of 164 prominent classical composers born after 1800. This paper employs a novel data set, extracted from large music dictionaries. We model the aggregate <b>stock</b> of <b>composers</b> in a country and find that periods of war correspond negatively {{with the number of}} artists. In a rough comparison framework, we demonstrate that the relationship is considerably higher for composers than for the total population. We also shed some light on the decision-making processes of forced migrants and find that the stock of best and most skilled composers is mostly affected by the incidence of conflict, while the number of composers with established personal ties seems to be less impacted by wars. migration, refugee, conflict, war, geographic concentration, composer...|$|R

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of two thin-walled outer tubes showed that more extensive alpha working of the billet <b>core</b> <b>stock</b> results in more uniform cladding on the extruded tube. In {{an effort to}} eliminate breakthrough and to reduce eccentricity, shift, and bending of the mandrel, two experimental coppernickel billets with Zircaloy sleeves were extruded to check a modified billet design. lt was observed that the final grain size of the unalloyed uranium core of a thin- walled outer tube is insensitive to small variations in the cooling rate from the beta-treatment temperature. An axia' load of 3000 pounds applied to a thin- walled outer tube during autoclaving was ineffective in preventing bowing of the tube. Shipping experiments demonstrated that current packaging methods of thin- walled inner tubes do not prevent bowing during transit. The fabrication of specimens for the capsule irradiation program was concluded with the shipment of sixteen specimens and excess extruded tube stock to Savannah River Laboratory. The following core compositions were represented: U- 1 wt. % Si, unalloyed dingot uranium, U- 0. 3 wt. % Al- 0. 5 wt. % Si, and U- 0. 3 wt. % Cr- 0. 3 wt. % Mo. All irradiation specimens were supplied in the beta-treated condition. The mechanical behavior of Zircaloy- 4 -clad dingot uranium tube sections was evaluated {{as a function of}} the cooling rate from the beta treatment temperature. The results indicate that the mechanical behavior is approximately independent of the cooling rate and that, in testing to failure, fracture initiates within the core. Also, in a eimilar test of a transient-melted ingot uranium tube, the uranium core appeared to be the most brittle component. Five tubular stainless steel- Zircaloy joints were extruded for use in an experiment to determine if such joints can withstand 30 and 40 % cold reductions. (auth...|$|R
