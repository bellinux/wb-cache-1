2500|$|According to the Pentagon's 2016 Selected Acquisition Report (SAR), {{released}} on 24 March 2016, The JLTV program has dropped its total costs by $5.9 billion. JLTV's total program costs dropped 19.32%, from $30.574 billion to $24.668 billion [...] "due primarily to revised estimates for unit costs of vehicles and kits based on realised savings", {{which accounted for}} a $3.7 billion decrease. A stretched out procurement [...] "due to budget adjustments and revised assumptions regarding the maximum buy profile year" [...] decreased costs by $1.28 billion, and several other changes – such as for <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> methodologies and indices – accounted for another $921 million decrease. [...] The SAR's total cost estimates include [...] "research and development, procurement, military construction, and acquisition-related operations and maintenance" [...] associated with a program, the Pentagon said. These reflect actual costs so far and anticipated costs in the future, with all estimates in fully inflated then-year dollars.|$|E
2500|$|Australia: The {{costs in}} Australia are {{estimated}} to be A$255 million for implementation, and A$22.7M for each year of maintenance. Over 10 years, this totals A$482.68M. With 77,000 resident US citizens (54% of whom are of dual citizenship) and known population of 24,003,100, the estimated implementation cost is A$6,270 per residing U.S. citizen, A$11,590 per U.S.-person account, or A$20.20 per capita. The most representative developed country has 661 bank accounts per 1,000 adults, and Australia has 82.1% population above 15 years old (adults). This yields an estimated 41,700 US-citizen bank customers in Australia, or a FATCA implementation cost of A$37.30 per customer. As there are 3,668 Australian FFI’s are currently registered, the average estimated FATCA cost for each is A$132,000. The same analysis showed that costs without the IGA would be A$477M for implementation, and A$58.8M for each year of maintenance. Over 10 years, this totals A$1.066bn, which would have been A$44.40 per capita, A$81.10 per customer, A$13,800 per resident U.S. citizen, or A$25,600 per U.S.-person account. This is the only published non-IGA country <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> identified. Without an IGA, the estimated FATCA cost per FFI is A$291,000. Australia succeeded to locate only 30,000 of those US citizens (72% effectiveness) in its first FATCA submission to USA. [...] It was determined that each located U.S. citizen bank account averaged A$160,000.|$|E

40|$|Standard {{definitions}} of the cost function do not admit risk. Standard (ex post) approaches to <b>cost</b> function <b>estimation</b> yield biased and inconsistent estimates when production is stochastic. Recently an (ex ante) approach to <b>cost</b> function <b>estimation</b> with stochastic production has been developed by imbedding the distance function in the <b>cost</b> function <b>estimation</b> problem. We generalize the approach to consider risk aversion in decision making. Only two empirical studies have considered stochastic production in <b>cost</b> function <b>estimation.</b> Both have required constant returns to scale. We demonstrate a methodology sufficiently general to consider nonconstant returns to scale. Copyright 1998, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the frame}} of the {{critical}} analysis of the Ariane 6 PPH, performed between 2013 and 2014 at SART, <b>cost</b> <b>estimations</b> played an important role. The <b>cost</b> <b>estimations</b> has been done with the Transcost method, which revealed to overestimate most of the production costs for European launch vehicle produced until now. Consequently, with the help of cost data gathered from different sources for the Ariane 5 launcher family and the Vega launcher an adapted model based on Transcost has been established. This report described the adaptation that have been performed to the Transcost model and propose an analysis of the production and operation costs of the Ariane 5 and Vega launchers...|$|R

This paper describes two small case studies, performed {{in the context of}} a team-project based software development course. In the first study, we compared intuitive <b>cost</b> <b>estimations</b> of changes to requirements to estimations based on historical data. In the second one, we studied whether even simple tools to support impact analysis affect the accuracy of <b>cost</b> <b>estimations.</b> Although the data we collected in these studies is not suitable for statistical analysis, we can present some interesting results and lessons learned. Our results suggest that estimations based on an impact analysis checklist are better than the intuitive estimations obtained in study one. However, study two is not yet completed therefore we cannot draw further conclusions. 1...|$|R
