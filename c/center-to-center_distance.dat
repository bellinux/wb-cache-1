40|$|Ordered {{arrays of}} FePt {{nanoparticles}} were prepared using a diblock polymer micellar method combined with plasma treatment. Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy analyses {{reveal that the}} molar ratios of Fe to Pt in metal-salt-loaded micelles deviate from those when metal precursors are added, and that the plasma treatment processes have little influence upon the compositions of the resulting FePt nanoparticles. The results from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy show that the maximum loadings of FeCl 3 and H 2 PtCl 6 inside poly(styrene) -poly(4 -vinylpyridine) micelles are different. The composition deviation of FePt nanoparticles is attributed {{to the fact that}} one FeCl 3 molecule coordinates with a single 4 -vinylpyridine (4 VP) unit, while two neighboring and uncomplexed 4 VP units are required for one H 2 PtCl 6 molecule.

40|$|Abstract. Given {{a set of}} departments, {{a number}} of rows and {{pairwise}} connectivities between these departments, the multi-row facility layout problem (MRFLP) looks for a non-overlapping arrangement of these departments in the rows such that the weighted sum of the <b>center-to-center</b> <b>distances</b> is minimized. As even small instances of the (MRFLP) are rather challenging, several special cases have been considered in the literature. In this paper we present new mixed-integer linear programming formulations for the (space-free) multi-row facility layout problem with given assignment of the departments to the rows that combine distance and betweenness variables. Using these formulations instances with up to 25 departments can be solved to optimality (within at most six hours) for the first time. Furthermore {{we are able to}} reduce the running times for instances with up to 23 departments significantly in comparison to the literature. Later on we use these formulations in an enumeration scheme for solving the (space-free) double-row facility layout problem. In particular, we test all possible row assignments, where some assignments are excluded due to our new combinatorial investigations. For the first time this approach enables us to solve instances with up to 16 departments to optimality in reasonable time...|$|R
40|$|Fibers of deoxyHb S {{have been}} {{investigated}} by thin-section electron microscopy, utilizing a tannic acid embedding procedure. On the basis of numerous measurements of cross-sectional <b>center-to-center</b> <b>distances</b> for adjacent fibers in pairs or arrays, fiber diameters (mean +/- SD) of 205 +/- 5 A in embedded cells and 212 +/- 8 A in embedded hemolysates were obtained. This is an agreement with values obtained by conventional embedding procedures [Crepeau, R. H., Dykes, G., Garrell, R. L. & Edelstein, S. J. (1978) Nature (London) 274, 616 [...] 617]. The use of tannic acid has resulted in improved resolution of fiber cross sections, revealing individual strands of Hb S molecules. Because the section thickness corresponds to approximately one-fifth of the fiber helical repeat distance, the strands in projection superimpose to form characteristic image patterns. Additional superposition patterns arise in sections taken at small deviations from perpendicularity to the longitudinal fiber axis. These patterns {{are consistent with the}} 14 -strand structure for hemoglobin S fibers [Dykes, G., Crepeau, R. H. & Edelstein, S. J.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{magnetic}} vortex oscillations in circular LSMO (lanthanum strontium manganite) disks by micromagnetic simulations. The simulations were performed using the MuMax 3 software {{developed at the}} DyNaMat group (Dynamics of Functional Nano Materials) at Ghent University. A magnetic vortex confined in a magnetically soft ferromagnet with micron-sized lateral dimensions possesses a characteristic dynamic excitation known as the translational mode. Initial simulations focused on investigating this rotation of a vortex core around its equilibrium position. Calculations of the eigenfrequencies, extracted through a Fourier transform of the temporal oscillations of the average magnetization distribution, proved to be in agreement with analytical predictions. Further simulations focused on investigating vortex-vortex interactions, in order to verify the analogy with electrostatics predicted by condensed matter theory. This was done by mapping the respective trajectories of two vortices confined in two overlapping micron-sized disks. A rudimentary method for quantifying this interaction was introduces, based on aspect ratio of the horizontal and vertical diameters of a given trajectory. Comparing the trajectories for vortices with different rotational modes, {{as well as for}} different <b>center-to-center</b> <b>distances</b> between the ferromagnetic disks, a repulsive interaction was verified...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{structure}} of individual nucleosomes organized within reconstituted 208 - 12 arrays {{at different levels}} of compaction was examined by tapping mode atomic force microscopy in air and liquid. Reconstitution at lower histone octamer to DNA weight ratios showed an extended beads-on-a-string morphology with less than the expected maximum of 12 nucleosome core particles per array, each particle located in the most favored positioning site. A correlation of the contour lengths of these arrays with the number of observed particles revealed two distinct populations of particles, one with ∼ 50 nm of bound DNA and a second population with ∼ 25 nm. The measured nucleosome <b>center-to-center</b> <b>distances</b> indicate that this ∼ 25 nm is not necessarily symmetrically bound about the dyad axis, but can also correspond to DNA bound from either the entry or exit point of the particle to a location at or close to the dyad axis. An assessment of particle heights suggests that particles wrapping ∼ 25 nm of DNA {{are most likely to be}} subnucleosomal particles, which lack either one or both H 2 A-H 2 B dimers. At a higher reconstitution ratio, folded compact arrays fully populated with 12 nucleosome core particles, were observed.
