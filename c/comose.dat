50|$|This {{family of}} moss is either <b>comose</b> or hoary and forms loose, yellow- or brown-green turves or cushions. It has a creeping, {{subterranean}} primary stem with pale rhizoids and scale-like leaves while its glossy secondary stem is erect, laterally branched and usually amentaceous. Its ecostate leaves are broadly elliptic to nearly cochleariform, strongly concave, appressed or erect-spreading, occasionally slightly decurrent; margins erect or narrowly recurved, entire or toothed, and are densely packed at stem apices.|$|E
50|$|P. grandiglobum is a <b>comose,</b> {{medium-sized}} to robust moss with shoots {{that are}} approximately 10 mm tall, solitary or in loose colonies, bright yellow-green above and dark brown below http://www.cpbr.gov.au/cryptogams/underworld/panel-9/images-large/6-4.jpg. The primary stem grows underground in a creeping fashion while sparse lateral branches and pale, smooth rhizoids grow from secondary branches. Its on-decurrent, costaless leaves are deeply concave, blunt or apiculate, and crowded at stem apices, forming elongate comae in fertile plants. Leaf margins are slightly recurved above or {{nearly to the}} leaf base and entire or with a few irregular teeth. The perichaetia borne on lateral branches surrounds several archegonia mixed with uniseriate paraphyses, and upon fertilisation, swells to 5-7 mm long. The perigonia is also scattered on short lateral branches found on secondary stems, enclosing up to 70 short antheridia and uniseriate paraphyses. The large, globose capsule is unmistakable when present and is held suspended on a long setae 18-25 mm in length, with the capsule itself being 2.6-4.9 mm in diameter. At {{the apex of the}} inoperculate capsule is a small apiculus which is the calyptra perched atop as a tiny beak https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidtng/with/4261875715/. At the base of the capsule there is an abundance of stomata present. Capsules generally mature between spring to late-autumn, changing from pale green to orange and splitting open at the side to release smooth, oval spores 35-57 µm in diameter. Its broad altitudinal range probably contributed to the extended fruiting period. It {{is important to note that}} the capsules of P. grandiglobum are always globuse and never transition into a bright orange-red discoid as do the mature capsules of P. ovalifolium http://www.nzflora.info/factsheet/Taxon/Pleurophascum_ovalifolium.html.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} successful {{growth of}} defective 2 D terrace MoSe 2 /CoMoSe lateral heterostructures (LH), bilayer and multilayer MoSe 2 /CoMoSe LH, and vertical heterostructures (VH) nanolayers by doping metal Co (cobalt) element into MoSe 2 atomic layers {{to form a}} <b>CoMoSe</b> alloy at the high temperature (~ 900 °C). After the successful introduction of metal Co heterogeneity in the MoSe 2 thin layers, more active sites can be created to enhance hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities combining with metal Co catalysis, through the mechanisms including (1) atomic arrangement distortion in <b>CoMoSe</b> alloy nanolayers, (2) atomic level coarsening in LH interfaces and terrace edge layer architecture in VH, (3) formation of defective 2 D terrace MoSe 2 nanolayers heterogeneous catalyst via metal Co doping. The HER investigations indicated that the obtained products with LH and VH exhibited an improved HER activity in comparison with those from the pristine 2 D MoSe 2 electrocatalyst and LH type MoSe 2 /CoMoSe. The present work shows a facile yet reliable route to introduce metal ions into ultrathin 2 D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCS) and produce defective 2 D alloy atomic layers for exposing active sites, and thus eventually improve their electrocatalytic performance...|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{dominant}} models of the composing process demonstrates that they ignore or minimize {{at least one of}} two significant 2 ̆ 2 dimensions 2 ̆ 2 of this process. The first of these is affect, that is the emotion that potentially contextualizes, motivates, and informs any writing. The second such dimension is creativity, that is the perception of that which is new and/or original by the writer through her ordering and re-ordering of experience, which is, in turn, a primary function of composing. Accordingly, any model of composing intending to describe this process accurately must account for these significant dimensions of <b>comosing.</b> Furthermore, such a description can be accomplished, at least on the macro level, through the application of a concept that is compatible both in design and in theory with this study 2 ̆ 7 s aims and that has proven to be fruitful in several ancilliary fields: namely, scripts/schemata. ^ Chapter One introduces the concept of scripts/schemata, explaining their function(s) in child development, linguistics, artificial intelligence, reading theory, and clinical psychology. On the basis of this review, analogous entities called rhetorical scripts are posited; they are defined to be those cognitive and affective, transdevelopmental, and hierarchically organized meaning-making structures through whose interaction an emerging text is created. Chapter Two surveys the 2 ̆ 2 best 2 ̆ 2 extant models of composing, showing that they discount affect and/or creativity and noting as well the recent informal work of rhetoricians seeking to describe composing, as does this undertaking, through focusing on the person composing. ^ Chapter Three discusses factors contributing to the development of rhetorical scripts, exlains their general nature, and details their orientations: Initial I, oriented affectively to the writer; Audience-Adapted I, oriented to the writer 2 ̆ 7 s projection of audience; and Emerging I, oriented to the external world and to composing itself, thereby responsible for integrating the activity of the three scripts. Chapters Four, Five, and Six discuss, respectively, the subscripts constituting Initial I, Audience-Adapted I, and Emerging I; these chapters also explain how these competencies and scripts interact during composing to produce the emerging text. The Conclusion summarizes this study, discusses its significance, and recommends further research. ...|$|R
40|$|Background : Computer Tomography {{scanning}} {{has recently}} been a tool for diagnosis of normal anatomy and pahtology in medical sciences. The CT method has also been applied in ancient human skeletal remains and yield good results for researching the morphology, pathology, and postfossilization bone alteration. Paleoanthropological evidences exhibit that biological remains sometimes are fossilises, thus enabling the pursuit of scientific inquiries in regard to anatomy and biology of ancient humains. Aims of study : to know the morphology and antomy of the crania includint the internal structures that is not feasible in external bone stydy, such air pneumatisation, the shape of frontal sinuses, and thickness of the external table, diploe, or the internal table. This study also aims to know the mineralization distribution {{as a result of}} fossilization. Material and Method : the material in this study was a fossil crania of Ngandong 7 that belongs to the latest representation of the homo erectus from Ngandong, East Java, Indonesia. Ng 7 is from the late Pleistocene period dates about 27 000 to 10 000 years agos. The CT scan was conducted in the Quinze-Vingts hospital, Paris, in January 2001. The method used is by apllying a medical CT based data in order to extract the maximum information concerning mineralization, internal cranial features, osseous distribution and disease. An adapted acquisition and analisys protocols are developed from the CT scan. Results : mineralization of Ng 7 occured during fossilization, causing the diploe to bo thickened than normally in antemortem and fossilization periodes. Because of most-mortem transformation of the individual structures, many slices of CT scans were necessary. The internal structures showed ovoid shape of frontal sinuses, and well developed pneumatisation of the mastoid region. Cracks were detected as a result of post fosilization compressions. Lesions appeared on CT scan just posterior to the bregma in the form of eroded external table. This caused diffuse boundary between external table, diploe, and internal table due to homogenous mineralization. Conclusion : It is concluded that the Ngandong 7 homo erectus shares internal morphological similarities with other Ngandong and Sambungmacan fossils and presents lesions that might have caused by pathology during the life of the individual. The post-mortem history of this fossil appears to be <b>comosed</b> of at least two distinct stages with osseous loss and fluvial transport, followed by taphonomic and diagenetic processes...|$|R
40|$|Seed {{characteristics}} and seed germination behaviour of Hoya parasitica Wall. (Asclepiadaceae) were observed {{to study the}} potentials of the seed for propagation and genetic conservation of the species. Seeds were collected from follicles produced by Hoya collection of Bogor Botanical Gardens. They are small, thin, plumed and showing a <b>comose</b> type. The weight of 100 seeds was 0. 7 — 0. 9 gram and the water content was 26 — 30 % {{at the time of}} fruit opening. The water content decreased rapidly to 12. 7 % and 21. 4 % after one day of storage in a desiccator containing silica gel and in the open air, respectively. This is in accordance with the natural behaviour of the seed that is dispersed mainly by wind. In general, the seeds were easy to germinate (up to 99 % total germination), both in the dark and under natural light, and there was no substantial dormancy encountered during seed germination. The seeds were able to germinate up to 60 % while the water content was 3. 8 %, suggesting the possibilities of long-term storage of the seed for plant genetic resources conservation. </p...|$|E

40|$|Neste ensaio, procuramos examinar o fenômeno do apagamento da vogalpostônica não-final em palavras proparoxítonas de 36 falantes de fala dialetal das áreas urbana e rural de Jaru, Estado de Rondônia. Para isso, seguimos as bases teóricas da Sociolinguística, teoria que teve como {{precursor}} William Labov. Outras teorias que deram suporte a este trabalho foram: a Fonologia Prosódica e, principalmente, a FonologiaMétrica. Trata-se, pois, de pesquisa não-experimental, com enfoque e alcance quantitativos e descritivos, visando definir se a língua da região onde foi feita a pesquisa encontra-se em estado de variação ou de mudança linguísticas. Veremos que vários foram os grupos defatores que influenciaram o apagamento da vogal postônica não-final e que a faixa etária foi o principal grupo que determinou sua ocorrência, seguido do tipo de entrevista e da escolaridade. Além de analisarmos os resultados obtidos e discuti-los, veremos, ainda, <b>comose</b> dá o processo de apagamento da vogal postônica acima descrita, como também a formação da paroxítona. This essay exams {{the phenomenon}} of syncope in post-tonic non-final vowel in proparoxytones from 36 dialect speakers in an urban and ruralcommunity of Jaru, Rondônia State (Brazil). We follow the theoretic bases of Sociolinguistics, a theory that had William Labov as its precursor. Other theories that are also important to develop this project were: Prosodic Phonology and especially Metric Phonology. Therefore, it is a non-experimental research with a quantitative, descriptive focus and aptitude. The aim is to define whether the language, from the region where the research has done, is in variation or in linguistic change. It {{has been shown that}} there areseveral factors that influenced {{the phenomenon of}} syncope in post-tonic non-final vowel, and age level was the principal group that determined its occurrence, followed by the interview type and educational level. Besides the analysis of the obtained results anddiscussion, it has been proved how the syncope of the post-tonic vowel occurs, as well as the formation of the paroxytones...|$|E
