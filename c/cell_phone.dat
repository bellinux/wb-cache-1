I then look at the marketing and consumption of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> in the (over) developed world, focusing on the USA. I argue that the Philippine protest movement, known as People Power II, indicates the medium’s progressive potential, while the marketing of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> in the USA indicates the medium’s reactionary potential, or, borrowing a term from Paul Virilio, the <b>cell</b> <b>phone’s</b> potential as ‘technological nanny’. The comparison tries to steer between two orientations in cultural studies – which I characterize as the optimism of techno-utopianism and the pessimism of techno-phobia – in order to appreciate the political potential of <b>cell</b> <b>phones,</b> in particular, and technology in general...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the pedagogic approach that best support effective use of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> in the distance education context. Many distance education scholars agreed that students need to be supported both cognitively and affectively through mediated forms of interaction. Distance education institutions have used a variety of technologies to enhance interaction but none has been so readily available and accessible as <b>cell</b> <b>phones.</b> The usage of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> in supporting students is most suitable in Africa because it is affordable and has the ability to connect less privileged people to information. Despite evidence that show that <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> can be used successfully as a cognitive delivery tool, the pedagogical affordances of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> have not yet been fully explored in most developing countries. To understand the pedagogy for mobile learning, it is important to look at distance education theories to determine the importance of interaction on the efficacy of distance learning. The idea is to map the role of interaction in the distance education transaction with the aim of facilitating and devising pedagogical strategies and techniques that can be used to assist students and lecturers to use <b>cell</b> <b>phones.</b> Therefore, the use of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> in teaching and learning should be grounded on sound theoretical and pedagogical principles.

40|$|AbstractCell {{phones are}} {{commonly}} used in healthcare settings for rapid communication within hospitals. Concerns have been increased {{about the use of}} these devices in hospitals, as they can be used everywhere, even in toilets. Therefore, they can be vehicles for transmitting pathogens to patients. This study aimed to examine the presence of pathogenic bacteria on the surfaces of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> that are used frequently by preclinical medical students. This cross-sectional study identified both pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria on <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> of 105 medical students at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, using standard microbiological methods. Out of 105 <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> screened, 101 (96. 2 %) were contaminated with bacteria. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most abundant isolates (68 %). Seventeen (16. 2 %) <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> were found to harbor Staphylococcus aureus. Gram-positive bacilli were isolated from 20 (19 %) samples. Viridans streptococci and Pantoea species were also isolated but at lower levels. Our findings indicate that <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> can act as reservoirs of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic organisms. Therefore, full guidelines about restricting the use of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> in clinical environments, hand hygiene, and frequent decontamination of mobile devices are recommended at an early stage in medical schools, to limit the risk of cross-contamination and healthcare-associated infections caused by <b>cell</b> <b>phones...</b>|$|R
40|$|Through {{critical}} analysis of selected news stories from sina. com from 2010 to 2015 about <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> and “left-behind children” in China, this article examines media discourses {{on the relationship between}} migrant families and communication technology. The author finds that the roles of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> in their lives are portrayed in the following narratives: 1) <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> are highly valuable for connecting family members living apart; 2) <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> are used as a problem-solver in charity giving and rural development projects; 3) <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> can bring unexpected risks to children lacking media literacy; and 4) <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> could harbour or unleash evil—associated with increasing cases of juvenile delinquency or crime stories. The author discusses how the different institutional goals of social agencies, corporations, educators, and law enforcement contribute to the polarity of the discourses, reflecting the societal anxieties over unsupervised use of mobile devices by adolescents, as well as the cultural and political implications of empowering the “have-nots” of the digital divide by improving access to communication technology...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>phones</b> {{have become}} a {{ubiquitous}} part of daily life for both teachers and learners alike. The educational potential afforded by <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> is diverse. The challenge for teachers is to capitalise on this ubiquity and make use of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> for educational purposes. This study investigates how <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> {{can be used in}} the teaching of Mathematics using VITALmaths video clips. Five VITALmaths video clips were uploaded onto <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> which were used in the classroom to explore the Theorem of Pythagoras in a visually appealing way that supported a conceptual understanding of the basis of the theorem. The study was conducted in two high schools in Grahamstown, South Africa. It involved two teachers from each school and a total number of 47 Grade 10 Mathematics students. The participating teachers were chosen from a group of Mathematics teachers taking part in the Mathematics Teacher Enrichment Programme (MTEP) of the FirstRand Foundation Mathematics Education Chair hosted by Rhodes University. This study is framed as a case study and is grounded within the interpretive paradigm. The study captures teachers’ and learners’ experiences in using <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> as instructional aids within the pedagogical context of the classroom. This research suggests that <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> can be a useful resource to support teaching and learning in the classroom, particularly in under-resourced schools. The use of VITALmaths video clips as mathematical content, and <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> as a vehicle of delivery, enhanced active participation and concentration, sped up lessons, encouraged collaboration as well as interaction and hands-on exploration, and promoted both student autonomy as well as teacher enrichment. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Delays {{in getting}} medical help are {{important}} factors {{in the deaths of}} many pregnant women and unborn children in the low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Studies have suggested that the use of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> and radio communication systems might reduce such delays. Objectives: We review the literature regarding the impact of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> and radio communication systems on delays in getting medical help by pregnant women in the LMIC. Design: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Maternity and Infant care (Ovid), Web of Science (ISI), and Google Scholar were searched for studies relating to the use of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> for maternal and child health services, supplemented with hand searches. We included studies in LMIC and in English involving the simple use of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> (or radio communication) to either make calls or send text messages. Results: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. All the studies, while of various designs, demonstrated positive contributory effects of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> or radio communication systems in reducing delays experienced by pregnant women in getting medical help. Conclusions: While the results suggested that <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> could contribute in reducing delays, more studies of a longer duration are needed to strengthen the finding...|$|R
