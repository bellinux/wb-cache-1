5|$|A {{supply of}} 929 M249 SAWs was issued to {{personnel}} from the U.S. Army and Marine Corps during the Persian Gulf War. Although exposure to combat was scarce, M249 gunners {{who were involved}} in fighting mainly used their weapons to provide cover fire for friendly maneuvering troops from fixed positions, rather than maneuvering with them. There were many complaints about the weapons <b>clogging</b> up with sand after prolonged use in the desert environment.|$|E
5|$|No {{ski poles}} are used, and no {{assistance}} from others (such as being pushed from the gate) is allowed. In heavy snow conditions the tracks can become clogged up, which reduces inrun speed and may cause an unpredictable descent for athletes. Event personnel {{standing by the}} sides of the inrun are often assigned to use leaf blowers to prevent the tracks from <b>clogging</b> up with snow.|$|E
5|$|The slime glands {{along the}} body of the hagfish secrete {{enormous}} amounts of mucus when it is provoked or stressed. The gelatinous slime has dramatic effects on the flow and viscosity of water, rapidly <b>clogging</b> the gills of any fish that attempt to capture hagfish; predators typically release the hagfish within seconds (pictured above). Common predators of hagfish include seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans, but few fish, suggesting that predatory fish avoid hagfish as prey.|$|E
50|$|Troentorp <b>Clogs</b> are wooden <b>clogs</b> {{handcrafted}} in Troentorp, Sweden, a {{small village}} approximately three kilometers from Båstad, Skåne in southern Sweden. Troentorp <b>Clogs</b> (formerly known as Båstad <b>Clogs)</b> have gained international recognition, especially during the 1970s when Swedish <b>clogs</b> became a widely popular footwear.

5|$|All {{movement}} had been restricted to night time, {{culminating in a}} general move forwards {{on the eve of}} battle. On the night of 18/19 September, the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions moved forward behind the infantry, while the Australian Mounted Division moved up to Sarona. Here the three divisions concentrated, with their supplies carried in massed horse-drawn transport and on long camel trains, <b>clogging</b> the roads. The divisions carried one iron ration and two days' special emergency rations per man, and 21 pounds (9.5kg) of grain per horse, all carried on the horse, with an additional day's grain per horse carried on the first line transport limbered wagons.|$|E
5|$|In most brachiopods, diverticula (hollow extensions) of {{the mantle}} {{penetrate}} through the mineralized {{layers of the}} valves into the periostraca. The function of these diverticula is uncertain and {{it is suggested that}} they may be storage chambers for chemicals such as glycogen, may secrete repellents to deter organisms that stick to the shell or may help in respiration. Experiments show that a brachiopod's oxygen consumption drops if petroleum jelly is smeared on the shell, <b>clogging</b> the diverticula.|$|E
5|$|Salford has {{a history}} of textile {{processing}} that pre-dates the Industrial Revolution, and as an old town had been developing for about 700years. Before the introduction of cotton there was a considerable trade in woollen goods and fustians. Other cottage industries prevalent at this time included <b>clogging,</b> cobbling, weaving and brewing. The changes to textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution {{had a profound effect on}} both on population and urbanisation, as well as the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of Salford.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch {{released}} {{reports of}} German soldiers in disguise {{to the international}} news agencies. This caused a fifth column scare, especially in Belgium and France. However, unlike the situation later on in those two countries, in the Netherlands there was no mass exodus of civilian refugees, <b>clogging</b> the roads. Generally German soldiers behaved in a civilised manner towards the Dutch population, forming neat queues at the shops to buy goods rationed in Germany, such as chocolate.|$|E
5|$|The Red Army was {{scheduled}} to enter Lithuanian territory from three separate directions at 3:00 pm and had orders {{to take control of}} Vilnius, Kaunas, Raseiniai, Panevėžys, and Šiauliai. The Lithuanian Army was ordered not to resist and to extend friendly greetings; its air force was ordered to remain on the ground. The Soviets came in great numbers <b>clogging</b> Lithuanian roads. They had an obvious intention to show power and intimidate any resistance. Writer Ignas Šeinius claimed that he observed the same squadron of Soviet planes making the same flight over and over again to create an impression of much larger Soviet Air Forces.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{moldboard}} iron plow: Although use of {{the simple}} wooden ard in China must have preceded it, the earliest discovered Chinese iron plows date to roughly 500 BC, during the Zhou Dynasty (1122–256 BC) and were flat, V-shaped, and mounted on wooden poles and handles. By the 3rd century BC, improved iron casting techniques {{led to the development}} of the heavy moldboard plow, seen in Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) artwork such as tomb carved bricks. The moldboard allowed the Chinese to turn farm soil without <b>clogging</b> the plowshare with dirt, which was flung off the wheelbarrow via slanted wings on both sides. While the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the Warring States period (403–221 BC) were made mostly of perishable wood except for the iron blade, the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the Han Dynasty were made entirely of solid iron with the moldboard attached to the top to turn the soil.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Clog</b> {{dancing is}} dancing whilst wearing <b>clogs.</b> The rigid {{nature of the}} <b>clogs</b> and their percussive sound when dancing on a hard surface {{has given rise to}} a number of {{distinct}} styles, including the following: ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Clog</b> {{dancing is}} a form of step dance characterised by the wearing of inflexible, wooden soled <b>clogs.</b> <b>Clog</b> dancing {{developed}} into its most intricate form in the North of England, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Durham and the Lake District.|$|R
5|$|Keeping up {{the longstanding}} {{tradition}} of Massachusetts Bay, Phips {{fought against the}} office of custom inspectors, arguing that the port of Massachusetts did not see enough enumerated goods to warrant their presence. Instead Phips attempted to re-establish a naval office, with himself acting {{as head of the}} admiralty, thereby doling out favors to gain the support of the powerful merchant class. This was part of an old turf battle between the Admiralty and Customs but it led to an altercation with Randolph's custom inspector, Jahleel Brenton, which seemed to follow the similar embarrassing and unseemly pattern as his altercation with Captain Short. The two altercations weighed together against Phips. Phips was accused of violating the Navigation Acts, as his predecessor had been. Blathwayt was slowly and steadily working to standardize the flow of tributes from the colonies to the Crown, and if Phips was <b>clogging</b> these pipes he would need to answer for it.|$|E
5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as <b>clogging,</b> which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E
5|$|With the MDHB on {{the verge}} of {{bankruptcy}} a decision was taken to shut down and sell off the whole of the south docks system. The warehouses were emptied and in 1972 the Albert Dock finally closed down. The Brunswick Dock gates, which separated the South Docks system from the River Mersey, were opened allowing tidal movements in and the process of the <b>clogging</b> up the docks with sewage polluted silt began. In many senses just as the Albert Dock's development had symbolised the prosperity in the Liverpool {{at the time of its}} construction, its subsequent decline after the Second World War symbolised the collapse of the local economy as a whole.|$|E
5000|$|Träskor are Swedish <b>clogs.</b> Swedish <b>clogs</b> {{are usually}} made from alder, but some times birch or pine is used. <b>Clogs</b> are mainly {{manufactured}} {{in the southern part}} of the country, both as handicrafts and in factories. In 1905 there were 22 factories employing 241 people. One manufacturer is based in Vollsjö in Skåne, <b>clogs</b> for business use are therefore branded [...] "Vollsjö slippers".|$|R

5000|$|Although {{associated}} in {{the popular}} mind with dancing, <b>clogs</b> are still used in industry and are available tested to EN345. Such <b>clogs</b> are particularly advantageous in metal working industries where hot swarf or spashes of molten metal may {{be found on the}} floor. In 1989 three shiploads of <b>clogs</b> were sent to The Netherlands due to the perceived inferiority of the Dutch <b>clog</b> in wet fields.|$|R
5|$|From September 2 to September 3, large waves, some {{as high as}} , {{impacted}} beaches throughout southern California, with Los Angeles and Orange Counties experiencing growing breakers, and Cabrillo Beach experiencing riptides for {{two days}} straight. Due to the Labor Day beach turnout, many reports of rescuing swimmers who were swept up by waves caused by the hurricane were received. On September 2, forty-seven swimmers in Zuma Beach had to be rescued despite warnings {{to stay out of}} deep water, and an additional 261 rescues were reported in Newport. More rescues were reported the next day, although no exact total from the second day is known. At the El Morro Beach Trailer Park near Laguna Beach, a group of sundecks estimated at $5,000(1968USD) were ripped from their supports by rough seas. Long Beach, in terms of damage, was particularly hit hard by Liza, with debris and sea foam from the heavy surf <b>clogging</b> storm drains. A group of tidal pools formed along an area of the beach, draining out from a parking lot on 72nd Street onto Ocean Boulevard, resulting in flooding that closed a section of the boulevard between 68th Place and 72nd Place to traffic. Various flower gardens were also reported to have been swamped by the flooding, but no damage to housing was reported. The weakened properties in West Newport Beach also sustained no additional damage.|$|E
5|$|Group Captain Allan Walters, {{formerly}} {{in charge}} of No.1 (Fighter) Wing in Darwin, assumed command of No.72 Wing following Eaton's reassignment. Enemy contact was generally sporadic and inconclusive, but on 9September 1943 a force of over thirty Japanese bombers and escorting fighters heading for Merauke were intercepted by fourteen of No.72 Wing's Kittyhawks and four of its Boomerangs; {{although most of the}} Kittyhawks' guns failed to fire through oil <b>clogging,</b> and none of the Boomerangs made contact, the Australian aircraft claimed one bomber and two fighters destroyed without loss. No.12 Squadron became fully operational at Merauke in September, but was mainly given patrol duty and only rarely saw enemy activity. The following month, No.84 Squadron converted to Kittyhawks and transferred to a new formation, No.75 Wing, which controlled units on Horn Island, Thursday Island and Higgins Field. During late 1943 and early 1944, No.86 Squadron was actively engaged in air defence, enjoying some success against Japanese bombers and their escorts, as well as participating in attacks on infrastructure and shipping in Dutch New Guinea.|$|E
25|$|Partial <b>clogging</b> is {{particularly}} insidious, {{as it is}} usually not discovered immediately, but only later by an unsuspecting user trying to flush a loaded toilet. Overflowing of the water mixed with excrement may then occur, depending on the bowl volume, tank capacity and severity of <b>clogging.</b> For this reason, rooms with flush toilets may be designed as wet rooms, with a second drain on the floor, and a shower head capable of reaching the whole floor area. Common means to remedy <b>clogging</b> include use of a toilet plunger, drain cleaner or a plumber's snake.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Clog</b> {{dancing is}} {{traditional}} in Wales {{and is a}} regular feature of both local and national eisteddfodau. Competition can be energetic with the dancers leaping over brooms.

[...] Welsh <b>clog</b> dancing is stylistically distinct from English <b>clog</b> dancing.|$|R
5000|$|Being wood, <b>clogs</b> cannot flex {{under the}} ball of the foot as softer shoes do. To allow the foot to roll forward most <b>clogs</b> have {{the bottom of the}} toe curved up, known as the cast. Some styles of <b>clogs</b> have [...] "feet", such as Spanish albarca. The <b>clog</b> rotates around the front edge of the front [...] "feet". Japanese and Indian <b>clogs</b> may have [...] "teeth" [...] or very high pegs {{attached}} to the soles. The <b>clog</b> can rotate around the front edge of the front [...] "tooth" [...] as the wearer strides forward. Some medieval pattens were in two pieces, heel through to ball and ball to toes. Joining the two was a leather strip forming a hinge, thus allowing the shoe above to flex.|$|R
5000|$|The type {{of upper}} determines how the <b>clogs</b> are worn. Whole foot <b>clogs</b> {{need to be}} close fitting and can be secured by curling the toes. In {{contrast}} wooden soled <b>clogs</b> are fastened by laces or buckles on the welt and therefore the toes are relaxed as in shoes. Half open <b>clogs</b> may either be secured like whole foot <b>clogs,</b> or have an additional strap {{over the top of}} the foot. Some sandal types, and in particular toe peg styles, are worn more like [...] "flip-flops" [...] and rely on the grip between the big and next toe.|$|R
25|$|Jellyfish can clog cooling equipment, {{disabling}} {{power plants}} in several countries. Jellyfish caused a cascading blackout in the Philippines in 1999, as well as damaging the Diablo Canyon Power Plant in California in 2008. <b>Clogging</b> can stop desalination plants, as well as <b>clogging</b> ship engines and infesting fishing nets.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, <b>clogging</b> {{has become}} more {{frequent}} due to regulations that {{require the use of}} small-tanked low-flush toilets in attempt to conserve water. Sometimes, three to four flushes periodically during the use of a low-flush toilet may be required to prevent <b>clogging,</b> thus using more water than larger-tanked toilets. Designs which increase the velocity of flushed water or improve the travel path can improve low-flow reliability.|$|E

50|$|The term step dancing {{can refer}} to several styles of {{traditional}} percussive dance and can also be called step <b>clog,</b> <b>clog,</b> or stepping. Traditionally, dancers would have danced in their work shoes. For example, in Lancashire, wooden-soled <b>clogs</b> were worn in the mills, and on Dartmoor, hard-soled leather shoes or boots would have been worn for farming. Nowadays, <b>clogs,</b> tap shoes, and hard-soled shoes are all worn depending on the style of dance.|$|R
