40|$|This article {{presents}} {{findings on the}} development and implementation of a <b>centralised</b> yield <b>management</b> project by an international hotel group in its over 160 hotel units. Data were collected over two years from the participant hotel group's three management levels through semi-structured interviews, observations and document analysis. The research findings reveal that developing and implementing a <b>centralised</b> yield <b>management</b> project is contextually a very complex and challenging task. Major problems and difficulties appear to have originated from the participant company's organisational structure and culture. In addition, a high labour turnover, poor HRM practices, ongoing developments and changes across the company seem to have had an impact on the implementation of yield practices. The existing literature on yield management seems to view yield implementation as a tactical activity and therefore fails to explain the strategic implications of deploying yield practices in service organisations. The overall recommendation of this article are that scholars and practitioners working in this area should view yield implementation more from the perspectives of strategic management and change management fields.

This allows a business to enter the information once rather than having to do it repeatedly for each individual document. Online training courses are also being developed to teach business owners the special requirements of international trade.|$|E

50|$|The sreni had a {{considerable}} degree of <b>centralised</b> <b>management.</b> The headman of the sreni represented {{the interests of}} the sreni in the king's court and in many official business matters. The headman could also bind the sreni in contracts, set the conditions of work within the sreni, often received a higher salary, and was the administrative authority within the sreni. The headman was often selected via an election by the members of the sreni, who could also be removed from power by the general assembly. The headman often ran the enterprise with two to five executive officers, who were also elected by the assembly.|$|E

40|$|The {{offshore}} AC hub {{was identified}} as a feasible network topology for an offshore node applied in a future pan-European Supergrid. A model of an offshore AC hub was developed in SimPowerSystemsTM using the round three offshore wind development zone Dogger Bank, as a case study. Two control philosophies, master-slave and droop control, are shown to successfully manage the voltage, current and complex power flow in the offshore AC hub following planned changes in operating conditions. The impacts of three different fault scenarios on the offshore AC hub are investigated. It is shown that each fault severely impedes normal operation of equipment in the offshore AC hub, as equipment ratings are exceeded. In addition, the loss of infeed to the onshore UK power network is extensive. Based on these outcomes, it is identified that additional fault management systems are required. A novel <b>centralised</b> fault <b>management</b> system is then developed based on an online OPF algorithm. The performance is compared to de-centralised fault management system, and advantages and disadvantages of the two methods are discussed. The <b>centralised</b> fault <b>management</b> system is implemented on a realtime platform as hardware-in-the-loop, with the offshore AC hub implemented on a Real Time Digital Simulator. The simulation and experimental results are then compared to confirm the validity of the simulation results...|$|R

The failure of the Earl William meant that the numbers of those who had to be released on temporary admission, (immigration bail), grew. The opening of Campsfield House Detention Centre in 1993 provided 200 extra spaces. The expansion led to a more <b>centralised</b> <b>management</b> of the detention estate whereas before the centres had largely been managed by the airports that they served.

40|$|Abstract. Total order ROWA {{strategies}} {{are widely used}} in replicated protocol design. Normally, these protocols provide higher isolation guarantees like Serialisable or Snapshot Isolation but, for some applications, a more permissive isolation level like Read Committed fits better. Some <b>centralised</b> database <b>management</b> systems provide Read Committed as a default isolation level but in replicated systems it is rare to find proposals and systems supporting it. In this paper we extend the notion of Read Committed to a replicated environment, giving the necessary theoretical background to construct Read Committed ROWA database replication protocols. ...|$|R
