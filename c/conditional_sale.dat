500|$|Famous Players put the Stanley up {{for sale}} in the spring of 1991, with the {{condition}} that it not be used as a movie theatre. In {{the months leading up to}} the Stanley's closure, Famous Players had a <b>conditional</b> <b>sale</b> agreement for the theatre with Vancouver developer Sandy Cox, who was planning to keep the Stanley's facade and convert the interior into retail space. The Vancouver City Council received a proposal to change the building to retail use, which it approved, but the planned development was abandoned, and the building remained vacant for several years. During the early 1990s, a [...] "Save Our Stanley" [...] campaign was begun to preserve the building and prevent commercial redevelopment of the space. In 1994, the Stanley Theatre Society was formed to try to buy the Stanley for the Arts Club Theatre Company, and in 1997 it purchased the theatre from Famous Players for $3,173,000. Renovation costs, including sound and lighting equipment, came to $5.8million, which brought the costs of purchase and renovation to about $9million, $1.5million more than the $7.5million originally budgeted. Money came from fundraising campaigns by the Arts Club and Vancouver TheatreSports, at least $3.9million from the provincial and federal government, a $100,000 grant from the City of Vancouver, the purchase of a density transfer to the One Wall Centre by Peter Wall for $1.2million, as well as corporate sponsorship by du Maurier, who contributed $1.2million—although du Maurier would later withdraw as a sponsor because of federal restrictions on tobacco advertising.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 78 - 79) This {{study examines}} the various methods automobile dealers from the Los Angeles area use for converting their automobile <b>conditional</b> <b>sales</b> contracts into working capital. As {{a foundation for}} this discussion, {{an example of a}} <b>conditional</b> <b>sales</b> contract and credit application is explained in detail with emphasis on dispelling confusion often surrounding installment financing. Personal interviews with banking and lending institutions revealed programs offered to automobile dealers for discounting the sales contracts. Interviews with automobile dealers from the Los Angeles area then determined what programs were chosen and why the dealer used it. The study shows that the dealer strives to use a method of discounting sales contracts which is the least expensive and which relieves the dealer of the responsibility for the customer making the payments. A compromise plan is in use today, whereby the dealer and lending institution share in the responsibility of the sales contract's unpaid balance, resulting in less expense to the dealer than if the lending institution were to accept full responsibility for the customer...|$|R

40|$|For many years, {{marketing}} {{managers have}} used dynamic sales response models to compute expected <b>sales</b> <b>conditional</b> on the available information.

Moreover, the covolatilities (<b>conditional</b> covariances) between <b>sales</b> and marketing-mix variables can be time varying. Both concepts introduce a new range of strategic and tactical considerations for product and brand managers. Using a multivariate volatility model, we investigate the covolatility of sales and the marketing mix of a focal brand and competing brands in the market. We also examine carryover effects from a volatility perspective. The methodology is applied to six product categories sold by Dominick’s Finer Foods. The results reveal valuable implications for marketing managers...|$|R

40|$|An {{installment}} {{land contract}} {{is a fairly}} simple conveyancing device, somewhat analogous to a <b>conditional</b> <b>sales</b> contract for personal property and is {{the most commonly used}} substitute for the purchase money mortgage or deed of trust. The vendor agrees to convey the described premises upon payment by the purchaser of a specified purchase price and upon performance of any other obligations outlined in the contract. The down payment is generally minimal, with the balance of the purchase price to be paid in installments at regular intervals over an extended period. Like a mortgage, installments are applied to principal and interest and the debt may extend over relatively short periods or for periods exceeding twenty years. Commonly, the vendor retains legal title until the final payment is made, at which time the deed is delivered to the purchaser, sometimes under an escrow arrangement made simultaneously with the installment contract. Some land sale contracts call for a deed to the purchaser after a certain percentage of the purchase price has been paid, at which time the purchaser delivers to the vendor a purchase money mortgage or deed of trust to secure payment of the balance. The purchaser usually takes possession at the time the installment contract is executed and assumes responsibility for taxes and upkeep of the property...|$|R

50|$|Use of {{property}} {{was divided into}} topsoil (tianpi) and subsoil (tiangu) rights. Landlords with subsoil rights had a permanent claim to the property if they paid taxes and received official seals from the government, but did not have rights to actively use the land. Instead, those with topsoil rights paid the subsoil landlord a fixed rent (or part of the proceeds of what was produced on the land) for not only the right to farm and live on the land, but the right to independently sell or lease the topsoil rights to another party. So as long as another party held topsoil rights, the party holding subsoil did not have right to actively use the land or evict the topsoil owner. Land, like other forms {{of property}}, was seen as being held collectively by the family and not individuals within the family. Another concept in imperial Chinese property rights was dianmai (典賣/典卖), more commonly known as huomai (活賣/活卖), or <b>conditional</b> <b>sales</b> of property that allowed the seller (i.e., his family) to buy back the land at the original price (without interest). The assumption was that land, having been held by a family for generations, should stay with the same family. From the Sui dynasty onwards, women could not hold property directly and, for land {{to stay in the}} same family, it had to pass between male heirs following the rule of primogeniture.|$|R
