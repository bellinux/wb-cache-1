This system consists of isolation of mitochondrion, preparation of high-molecular weight (HMW) mtDNA, partial digestion of megabase DNA, selection of digested fragment and highly-efficient transformation. A set of primers were designed according to the conserved sequence of the orfB, cox and nad 4 L coding region in other plants, and subsequently used to amplify these mitochondrial genes in cotton.

40|$|Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC class I) {{proteins}} {{are critical}} for immune defenses against viruses. Polygeny and polymorphism of alleles contribute to {{the breadth of the}} immune response. In previous study, researchers showed that a MHC class I gene termed Ctid-AB 190929 was found from a grass carp. It was a expressed gene from cDNA library. Now, characterization of a genomic clone from the same grass carp <b>constructed</b> fosmid <b>genome</b> <b>library</b> allows us to further analysis the MHC class I region. This clone carried whole MHC class I and tapasin gene. This MHC class I termed Ctid-UBA 0201 was the classical MHC class I by genomic analysis. But the amino acid sequences of Ctid-UBA 0201 were differed from that of Ctid-AB 190929. As lower vertebrates, appear to use a single expressed MHC class I locus to present a wide variety of peptide to antigen. The Ctid-UBA 0201 could be the allelic gene of Ctid-AB 190929. As the tapasin gene may be a unexpressed gene by genomic analysis, the Ctid-UBA 0201 may present a wide variety of peptide without the tapasin gene to control the assembly. It may preserve genetic diversity which can be exchanged when the species face a new pathogen...|$|R
40|$|Various {{types of}} genetic {{constructs}} {{are widely used}} as diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic tools for human diseases. They are also the workhorse in biotech and pharmaceutical industry for production of therapeutic antibodies and proteins. Since {{the majority of the}} genetic constructs encode protein products, it is therefore of tremendous value to human health and the society that we {{could find a way to}} fine-tune and optimize genetic constructs and hence protein expression for achieving maximal potency or long-lasting effects in therapeutics or for obtaining highest yields in pharmaceutical protein production. However, for protein-coding genes to be expressed in a heterologous host, the coding sequences need to be optimized by using synonymous codons to achieve reasonable levels of expression, if at all. Since codon optimization is done in a protein-by-protein basis with respect to specific host organisms, tissue/cell types, even health conditions, and there is no set of standard rules to follow, this process is still very unpredictable and time-consuming. This thesis presents the development of a feasible platform for solving the problem of optimizing regular and long DNA constructs for academic or industrial purposes through the development of a novel cloning method for complex gene libraries, and based on the library expression system constructed in such manner, a platform for high-throughput screening of codon-optimized and error-corrected proteins, and a novel protocol for screening long gene constructs which could be extremely difficult to achieve by using regular screening methods. This multi-step platform has the potential for studying the natural systems: how codon bias correlates to protein expression efficiency, for generating improved pharmaceutical proteins and enhanced DNA vaccines and for <b>constructing</b> improved <b>genome</b> <b>libraries.</b> Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is {{a common}} {{autosomal}} genetic disorder in Caucasian populations. CF is caused by mutations in the cftr gene, which encodes the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR regulates chloride and sodium ion transport across the epithelial cells lining the exocrine organs. Mutations in the cftr result in a failure to mediate chloride transport, which leads to dehydration of the mucus layer surrounding the epithelial cells. The mucus coating in the lung epithelia provides a favorable environment for invasion and growth of several opportunistic bacterial pathogens resulting in life threatening respiratory infections in CF patients. ^ Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) and Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) are associated with chronic lung infections and are responsible {{for much of the}} mortality in CF. Little is known about interactions between these two, often co-infecting, species. When in competition, it is not known whether Bcc replaces the resident Pa or if the two species co-exist in the CF lung. ^ Bacteriocins are potent toxins produced by bacteria. They have a quite narrow killing range in comparison to antibiotics and have been implicated in intra-specific and inter-specific bacterial competition brought on by limited nutrients or niche space. Both Pa and Bcc produce bacteriocins known as pyocins and cepaciacins, respectively. More than 90 % of Pa strains examined to date produce one or more of three pyocin types: R, F, and S. A limited number of phenotypic surveys suggest that approximately 30 % of Bcc also produce bacteriocins. ^ The goals of my thesis study were to determine if clinical strains of Pa and Bcc produce bacteriocins and to determine whether these toxins play a role in mediating intra- and inter-specific bacterial interactions in the CF lung. The final goal was to identify novel bacteriocins from clinical Pa and Bcc strains. ^ First, I designed a phenotypic bacteriocin survey to evaluate bacteriocin production in 66 clinical Pa (38) and Bcc (28) strains procured from CF patients. This study revealed that 97 % of Pa strains and 68 % of Bcc strains produce bacteriocin-like inhibitory activity. Further phenotypic and molecular based assays showed that the source of inhibition is different for Pa and Bcc. In Pa, much of the inhibitory activity is due to the well known S- and RF-type pyocins. S- and RF pyocins were the source of within species inhibitory activity while RF pyocins were primarily implicated in the between species inhibitory activity of Pa strains. In contrast, Bcc inhibition appeared to be due to novel inhibitory agents. Finally, I <b>constructed</b> <b>genome</b> <b>libraries</b> of B. multivorans, B. dolosa, and B. cenocepacia to screen for genes responsible for the inhibitory activity previously described in Bcc. ∼ 10, 000 clones/genome were screened, resulting in fifteen clones with the anticipated inhibition phenotype. Of these fifteen, only five clones had stable inhibitory activity. These clones encoded proteins involved in various metabolic pathways including bacterial apoptosis, amino acid biosynthesis, sugar metabolism, and degradation of aromatic compounds. Surprisingly, none of Bcc clones possessed typical bacteriocin-like genes. These data suggest that, in contrast to all bacterial species examined in a similar fashion to date, Bcc may not produce bacteriocins. Instead, Bcc may be using novel molecular strategies to mediate intra- and inter-specific bacterial interactions. ...|$|R

However, the P. leiognathi lux operon cloned in pL 741 shows dim {{bioluminescence}} in E. coli; it {{suggested that the}} lux operon required regulatory gene(s) to induce or enhance the gene expression. In trans complementa-tion bioluminoassays in vivo were used to <b>construct</b> P. leiognathi <b>genome</b> <b>library</b> for cloning the specific genes, which enable to enhance bioluminescence of the lux operon. pXY 5 and pXY 6 were isolated from two of the selected bright clones. Nucleotide sequences of the P. leiognathi genes carried on pXY 5 and pXY 6 were determined, and the genes were identified. The gene orders of the genes are -ufoI-ufoII-WTRR&R-gltS-WTI-WTIIR and torA-R&R-torCR on pXY 5 and pXY 6, respectively (R&R: regulatory region; W: transcription terminatior). Apparently ufoII, torA, torC, gltS genes are not the specific regulatory genes of the lux operon; but functional analyses show that ufoII, torA, torC genes enable to enhance biolumine-scence. It elicits that not only the specific regulatory genes enable to enhance bioluminescence of the lux operon, also many other genes enable to do. However, ufoII, torA, torC genes can enhance bioluminescence of the lux operon in E. coli, but the enhance mechanisms are not clear yet. Photobacterium leiognathi lux operon 在 E. coli 的螢光表現微弱，顯示可能需要調節基因或因子的參與調節機制。利用細胞內互補螢光分析的方法篩選可調節或增強螢光表現的基因，以了解其調節機制。由互補螢光分析結果選取二個具有 ~ 2. 7 kb 及 ~ 1. 5 kb P. leiognathi genomic DNA 的質體 pXY 5 、pXY 6 ，二者可使螢光表現增強約 ~ 1. 3 倍。DNA序列分析顯示 pXY 5 所包含 DNA 片段全長為 2, 744 bp 的序列，其基因排列順序為 -ufoI-ufoII-WTRR&R-gltS-WTI-WTIIR (R&R 為調節區域﹔W 為轉錄終止子) 。ufoII 及 gltS 基因為完整的基因。pXY 6 所包含DNA片段全長為 1, 568 bp 的序列，其基因排列順序為 torA-R&R-torCR，torA 及 torC 基因轉錄方向相反且為不完整的基因。序列分析顯示 GltS 蛋白為一 glutamate permease。ORFII 蛋白則為一 pI 等電點為 10. 16 未知的蛋白。torA 基因可主導 TMAO reductase 的形成，torC 基因可主導 cytochrome C 的形成。依據調節區域及轉錄終止子的功能分析，確認 potential hairpin loop WT 為 ufoII 基因的 transcription terminator，而 gltS 基因之調節區域其啟動子可能需要 regulator protein 或 enhancer binding protein 的協助才能啟動，以引導基因的表現。Potential hairpin loops WTI-WTII 為 gltS 基因的 transcription terminator。 ufoII, gltS, torA, torC 基因以 maxicell 蛋白質分析及螢光表現分析，確認產生 ~ 14 kDa 之 ORFII 和 ~ 35 kDa GltS 的產物，torA 及 torC 基因產物可能不穩定，沒能確認。此實驗篩選所得之 ufoII, gltS, torA, torC 基因應不是 P. leiognathi lux operon 的調節基因 (regulatory genes) ，但實驗的數據，可以肯定此等基因與 lux operon 在 in trans complementation 時確可加強螢光的表現，應是間接影響的結果。其中，GltS 蛋白大量表現可能使得菌體細胞膜受損，影響到菌體正常細胞生長狀況，使得螢光表現下降。ufoII, torA 及 torC 基因在 lac-promotor 的帶動下可增強 lux operon 的螢光表現，但其參與螢光表現的基因調節機制尚不清楚。中文摘要 …………………………………………………………… ii 英文摘要 ……………………………………………………………. iii 前言 ………………………………………………………………… 1 材料與方法 ………………………………………………………… 8 結果與討論 ………………………………………………………… 20 I. 可增強螢光表現之基因選殖 ………………………………. 20 II. 可增強 P. leiognathi lux Operon 螢光表現之基因定序與分析 20 (I) 選殖之 P. leiognathi Genomic DNA 定序 ……… 20 (II) 序列比對及分析 ……………………………………… 24 A. gltS 基因主導 Glutamate Permease的形成 …………. 24 B. torA, torC 基因分別主導 TMAO reductse, Cytochrome C 的形成 …………………………………………………… 36 III. 調節區域與轉錄終止子分析 ……………………………… 42 (I) ufoII 基因之轉錄終止子 WT 的功能分析 …………… 43 (II) gltS 基因之調節區域與轉錄終止子的功能分析 ……… 43 A. gltS 基因之調節區域的功能分析 …………………… 47 B. gltS 基因之轉錄終止子 WTI-WTII 的功能分析 ……… 47 (III) torA 及 torC 基因之間的調節區域功能分析 ………… 51 IV. gltS, ufoII, torA, torC 基因的蛋白質分析 ………………… 55 V. gltS, ufoII, torA, torC 基因對 P. leiognathi lux operon 螢光 表現之影響 …………………………………… 64 總結 ………………………………………………………………… 69 參考文獻 …………………………………………………………… 7...|$|R

The phage library is plated on Escherichia coli cells, immunoblotted, and probed with hyperimmune and/or convalescent-phase antiserum to rapidly identify vaccine candidates. These are then plaque purified and grown as liquid lysates, and whole bacteriophage particles are then used directly to immunize the host, following which PCMV-driven expression of the candidate vaccine gene occurs. In the example given here, a semirandom <b>genome</b> <b>library</b> of the bovine pathogen Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides small colony (SC) biotype was cloned into λ ZAP Express, and two strongly immunodominant clones, λ-A 8 and λ-B 1, were identified and subsequently tested for vaccine potential against M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC biotype-induced mycoplasmemia. Sequencing and immunoblotting indicated that clone λ-A 8 expressed an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) -inducible M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC biotype protein with a 28 -kDa apparent molecular mass, identified as a previously uncharacterized putative lipoprotein (MSC_ 0397). Clone λ-B 1 contained several full-length genes from the M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC biotype pyruvate dehydrogenase region, and two IPTG-independent polypeptides, of 29 kDa and 57 kDa, were identified on immunoblots. Following vaccination, significant anti-M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC biotype responses were observed in mice vaccinated with clones λ-A 8 and λ-B 1.

40|$|We used a novel {{approach}} that incorporated chromosome sorting, next-generation sequencing, array hybridization, and systematic exploitation of conserved synteny with model grasses to assign; similar to 86 % of the estimated; similar to 32, 000 barley (Hordeum vulgare) genes to individual chromosome arms. Using a series of bioinformatically <b>constructed</b> <b>genome</b> zippers that integrate gene indices of rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and Brachypodium distachyon in a conserved synteny model, {{we were able to}} assemble 21, 766 barley genes in a putative linear order. We show that the barley (H) genome displays a mosaic of structural similarity to hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) A, B, and D subgenomes and that orthologous genes in different grasses exhibit signatures of positive selection in different lineages. We present an ordered, information-rich scaffold of the barley genome that provides a valuable and robust framework for the development of novel strategies in cereal breeding...|$|R
40|$|Chickpea is a {{valuable}} and important agricultural crop, but yield potential is limited {{by a series of}} biotic and abiotic stresses, including Ascochyta blight, Fusarium wilt, drought, cold and salinity. To accelerate molecular breeding efforts for the discovery and introgression of stress tolerance genes into cultivated chickpea, functional genomics approaches are rapidly growing. Recently a series of genetic tools for chickpea have become available that have allowed high-powered functional genomics studies to proceed, including a dense genetic map, large insert <b>genome</b> <b>libraries,</b> expressed sequence tag libraries, microarrays, serial analysis of gene expression, transgenics and reverse genetics. This review summarises the development of these genomic tools and the achievements made in initial and emerging functional genomics studies. Much of the initial research focused on Ascochyta blight resistance, and a resistance model has been synthesised {{based on the results of}} various studies. Use of the rich comparative genomics resources from the model legumes Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus is also discussed. Finally, perspectives on the future directions for chickpea functional genomics, with the goal of developing elite chickpea cultivars, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The DNA of {{functional}} cis-regulatory modules displays extensive sequence conservation in comparisons of genomes from modestly distant species. Patches of sequence that are several hundred base pairs in length within these modules are often {{seen to be}} 80 - 95 % identical, although the flanking sequence cannot even be aligned. However, {{it is unlikely that}} base pairs located between the transcription factor target sites of cis-regulatory modules have sequence-dependent function, and the mechanism that constrains evolutionary change within cis-regulatory modules is incompletely understood. We chose five functionally characterized cis-regulatory modules from the Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin) genome and obtained orthologous regulatory and flanking sequences from a bacterial artificial chromosome <b>genome</b> <b>library</b> of a congener, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus. As expected, single-nucleotide substitutions and small indels occur freely at many positions within the regulatory modules of these two species, as they do outside the regulatory modules. However, large indels (> 20 bp) are statistically almost absent within the regulatory modules, although they are common in flanking intergenic or intronic sequence. The result helps to explain the patterns of evolutionary sequence divergence characteristic of cis-regulatory DNA...|$|R
40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae is a causative {{agent of}} otitis media, pneumonia, {{meningitis}} and sepsis in humans. For {{the development of}} effective vaccines able to prevent pneumococcal infection, characterization of bacterial antigens involved in host immune response is crucial. In order to identify pneumococcal proteins recognized by host antibody response, we created an S. pneumoniae D 39 <b>genome</b> <b>library,</b> displayed on lambda bacteriophage. The screening of such a library, with sera either from infected individuals or mice immunized with the S. pneumoniae D 39 strain, allowed identification of phage clones carrying S. pneumoniae B-cell epitopes. Epitope-containing fragments within {{the families of the}} histidine-triad proteins (PhtE, PhtD), the choline-binding proteins (PspA, CbpD) and zinc metalloproteinase B (ZmpB) were identified. Moreover, library screening also allowed the isolation of phage clones carrying three distinct antigenic regions of a hypothetical pneumococcal protein, encoded by the ORF spr 0075 in the R 6 strain genome sequence. In this work, Spr 0075 is first identified as an expressed S. pneumoniae gene product, having an antigenic function during infection...|$|R
40|$|Whole genome {{alignments}} {{have become}} a central tool in biological sequence analysis. A major application is the de novo prediction of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) from structural conservation visible in the alignment. However, current methods for <b>constructing</b> <b>genome</b> alignments do so by explicitly optimizing for sequence similarity but not structural similarity. Therefore, de novo prediction of ncRNAs with high structural but low sequence conservation is intrinsically challenging in a genome alignment because the conservation signal is typically hidden. This study addresses this problem with a method for genome-wide realignment of potential ncRNAs according to structural similarity. Doing so reveals thousands of new high-confidence ncRNA predictions with particularly low sequence conservation from an alignment of 12 Drosophila genomes and hundreds from an alignment of 28 vertebrate genomes in the Encode project. by Michael Ku Yu.

40|$|Background: Understanding the aetiologies of {{neurodegenerative}} {{diseases such}} as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Pick’s disease (PiD), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is often hampered by the considerable clinical and molecular overlap between these diseases and normal ageing. The development of high throughput genomic technologies such as microarrays provide a new molecular tool to gain insight in the complexity and relationships between diseases, as they provide data on the simultaneous activity of multiple genes, gene networks and cellular pathways. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have <b>constructed</b> <b>genome</b> wide expression profiles from snap frozen post-mortem tissue from the medial temporal lobe of patients with four neurodegenerative disorders (5 AD, 5 PSP, 5 PiD and 5 FTD patients) and 5 control subjects. All patients were matched for age, gender, ApoE-e and MAPT (tau) haplotype. From all groups a total of 790 probes were shown to be differently expressed when compared to control individuals.

ESTs provide researchers with a quick and inexpensive route for discovering new genes, for obtaining data on gene expression and regulation, and for <b>constructing</b> <b>genome</b> maps. Oil palm EST sequences as available in public domain are downloaded. They were grouped and made contigs using CAP 3 and Phrap. Microsatellite repeats are located using 5 softwares (MISA, TRA, TROLL, SSRIT, SSR primer). Among the 5 methods MISA {{is found to be}} the best. It can elucidate the compound repeat also.
