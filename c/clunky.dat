5|$|Uru {{was not as}} well {{received}} as previous Myst titles. Critics admired the visuals and new features of the game but criticized the lack of multiplayer in the retail version and <b>clunky</b> controls. Compared to previous games in the series, which had sold millions of units, Urus sales were considered disappointing. The game was a critical and commercial disappointment for Cyan, causing the company financial troubles; nevertheless, it has attracted a cult following.|$|E
5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, the J-Man of Just Games Retro said {{the game is}} overly slow, as the player must produce a few basic buildings and peasants in order to gather resources, and then start building combat units, while the enemy starts with more buildings {{and the ability to}} immediately send out offensive units to undo the player's efforts. He also criticized that the basic units of the two sides are essentially identical and that the interface is <b>clunky,</b> but praised the resource system and effective enemy AI.|$|E

5000|$|The Commission on Global Governance was an {{organization}} co-chaired by Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, and former Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, {{that produced a}} controversial report, Our Global Neighborhood, in 1995. [...] The report was attacked by pro-sovereignty groups for calling for United Nations reforms that would increase its power. It also was criticized by world federalists who disliked the terminology of [...] "global governance", which seemed <b>clunkier</b> than [...] "world federalism." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{episode was}} {{received}} positively by critics at the time. Alan Sepinwall, writing for New Jersey's The Star-Ledger, praised the episode, {{saying that it}} and the show itself were [...] "dense and layered" [...] and [...] "deserving of deeper analysis." [...] Todd VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club in 2014, was more critical of the episode, writing that the episode was [...] "one of Mad Men's <b>clunkier</b> episodes" [...] but he praised {{other aspects of the}} episode, including John Slattery's performance as Roger.|$|R
5000|$|Reviews {{tempered}} their praise with {{criticism of}} Crichtons writing style. De Haven {{took issue with}} the novels use of genre clichés and [...] "the <b>clunkiest</b> of plot gimmicks." [...] Holt called it [...] "formulaic but hard to put down" [...] and described its characters as [...] "cardboard." [...] Lehmann-Haupt went even further, saying, [...] "When you finish the novel and ask yourself why you end up feeling both entertained and frustrated, you are forced to reflect that a writer clever enough to bring such material to life {{ought to have been}} able to tell his story without playing manipulative games with the reader." ...|$|R

500|$|The Daily Mail Chris Tookey {{said that}} the film was bloated and overly long, and criticized the sombre tone and lack of humor, despite praising the film's visually-impressive set pieces. CNN's Tom Charity said the film was a [...] "disappointingly <b>clunky</b> and bombastic {{conclusion}} to a superior series" [...] and called it Nolan's worst film. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker says that the [...] "story is dense, overlong, and studded with references that will make sense only to those intimate with Nolan's previous excursions into Batmanhood".|$|E
500|$|The song, [...] "Hey! It's a Happy Day!" [...] quotes Hubbard's Scientology: A New Slant On Life. [...] Songs {{are set to}} [...] "cheesy synth-keyboard backing" [...] {{and feature}} [...] "sublimely <b>clunky</b> dance breaks". [...] An {{electronic}} score emphasizes the musical's [...] "loony conviction", while sleigh bells give the play a feeling of a [...] "jazzed-up saint's play". [...] The songs incorporate video game music, and [...] "beats from a child's keyboard synthesizer." [...] The music in the show has been compared with the symphonic band Polyphonic Spree, and with the educational short films of Schoolhouse Rock.|$|E
50|$|Prime Sentinels are {{equipped}} with several technological superpowers: flight, super-strength, and force-blasts {{as well as being}} able to dampen or disrupt the powers of mutants around them. They have combat computers, which allow them to compensate for surprising events (say, the arrival of police cars) faster than normal humans. Finally, their programming may use the natural personality of the host to lull unsuspecting targets into conversation, at which point they dampen their powers and kill them. Omega Prime Sentinels, like Karima Shapandar, {{are equipped}} with some level of electromagnetic powers, but these were apparently prototypes, as their designs are <b>clunkier</b> than other Prime Sentinels.|$|R
5000|$|Work on Pizza {{has more}} or less stopped since 2002. Its main {{developers}} have concentrated instead on the Generic Java project, another attempt to add generics to Java which was eventually adopted into the official language version 1.5. The pattern matching and other functional programming-like features have been further developed in the Scala programming language. Martin Odersky remarked, [...] "we wanted to integrate the functional and object-oriented parts in a cleaner way than what {{we were able to}} achieve before with the Pizza language. ... In Pizza we did a <b>clunkier</b> attempt, and in Scala I think we achieved a much smoother integration between the two." ...|$|R
5000|$|Caroline Siede of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B: [...] "Unlike last week’s episode, “Resist,” which wove {{together}} {{a whole bunch}} of the season’s ongoing storylines while maintaining a palpable sense of forward momentum, “Nevertheless, She Persisted” is a tad <b>clunkier.</b> After resolving last week’s cliffhanger and defeating a mind-controlled Clark, Kara decides to take on Rhea in an ancient Daxamite single combat duel. But when Rhea goes back on her word, Kara has to activate a device that will fill the Earth’s atmosphere with lead, making it inhospitable to Daxamites, including Mon-El. The episode’s heart {{turns out to be the}} Kara/Mon-El relationship, although it takes about 2/3 of the episode to get there. But if the plot is a little thin, at least the action isn’t." ...|$|R

She coined her own phrase, 'turnspeak'. You go to Mr. Dershowitz's book, he got so confused in his massive borrowings from Joan Peters that on two occasions, I'll cite them for those who have a copy of the book, on page 57 and on page 153 he uses the phrase, quote, George Orwell's 'turnspeak'. 'Turnspeak' is not Orwell, Mr. Dershowitz, you're the Felix Frankfurter chair at Harvard, you must know that Orwell would never use such a <b>clunky</b> phrase as 'turnspeak'.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the first}} season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated an A, being called [...] "dense, dazzling, and dark", {{with the introduction of}} The Lone Gunmen being praised. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, described it as [...] "occasionally <b>clunky</b> but generally fun", finding the revelations of Deep Throat's motivation to be a highlight. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, felt that the episode was {{a good example of the}} series refusing [...] "to show its hand too early", saying that it would even have worked well as a season finale. The plot for [...] "E.B.E." [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Les Martin.|$|E
500|$|Taylor Cocke of IGN {{rated the}} title 8.2/10, {{concluding}} that [...] "neither title is perfect due to some blatantly unbalanced characters, {{but as a}} walk down memory lane, this package is hard to beat." [...] Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine gave the game a score of 7/10, saying the [...] "minimal-frills two-pack is definitely entertaining while it lasts." [...] Heidi Kemps of Official Xbox Magazine came to a verdict of 6.5/10, praising the visual presentation and accurate reproduction of the coin-operated originals, while criticizing <b>clunky</b> mechanics. Official PlayStation Magazine Australia labeled Marvel vs. Capcom Origins [...] "a bland and unexciting update {{of a couple of}} classics that have long been superseded," [...] rating the game 5/10.|$|E
5000|$|Wilder {{is often}} {{mentioned}} as a [...] "disciple" [...] of Lubitsch. In his 2007 essay on the two directors for Stop Smiling magazine, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that Love in the Afternoon was [...] "the most obvious and explicit and also, arguably, the <b>clunkiest</b> of his tributes to Lubitsch, partially inspired by Lubitsch's 1938 Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (which Wilder and Brackett also helped to script, and which also starred Gary Cooper, again playing a womanizing American millionaire in France)". John Fawell wrote in 2008 that [...] "Lubitsch was at his most imaginative when he lingered outside of doorways, particularly when something promiscuous was {{going on behind the}} door, a habit his pupil Billy Wilder picked up. In Wilder's most Lubitsch-like film, Love in the Afternoon, we know when Gary Cooper's rich playboy has bedded another conquest when we see the group of gypsy musicians (that travels with Cooper to aid in his wooing) tiptoe out of the hotel room, shoes in hand." ...|$|R
5000|$|USA Todays Kelly Lawler {{was more}} {{critical}} of the series, awarding it 2 out of 4 stars, feeling Rand was the [...] "undeniable handicap" [...] of the series, noting [...] "One would hope that The Defenders would shy away from Danny and his petulance, but unfortunately, Iron Fist is integral to the larger plot. Every scene featuring him drags, and he is in too many to ignore, with <b>clunkier</b> dialogue than his fellows." [...] She also felt The Defenders suffered from the pacing issue the previous individual series had, and {{while some of the}} character pairings worked, as a group the Defenders [...] "lack chemistry". Lawler felt Weaver was [...] "a bright spot" [...] but concluded [...] "The Defenders will likely please devoted Marvel fans who merely want to see these four in the same room... But viewers who were attracted to {{one or more of the}} Netflix series for their unique perspectives will be disappointed. Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and even Iron Fist deserve better." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from most music critics, but received positive reviews in retrospect. Writing for NME in November 1997, Ben Willmott called it [...] "supremely irritating" [...] and stated [...] "Kylie belts out the lyrics like she's reading from an autocue. Any soul {{is lost in}} a slurry of bought-in brass and a ropey guitar solo that's be more at home on a Shakin' Stevens record." [...] John Magnan from The Age said while the song was a stand out to the album, it [...] "is {{actually one of the}} album's <b>clunkier</b> tracks". Jaime Gill from Yahoo! Music reviewed her Ultimate Kylie compilation album, and criticised the musical composition by calling it a [...] "awkward faux-rock". Matt James from PopMatters reviewed her compilation The Best of Kylie Minogue and was disappointed with [...] "Some Kind of Bliss"' absence, labelling it a [...] "lost classic". Larry Flick from Billboard was positive, saying [...] "Ms. Minogue has been reborn as an alterna-pop vixen to be reckoned with." ...|$|R
500|$|Complaints from Uru: Ages Beyond Myst {{carried over}} to Myst Online; for example, Robert Washburne of JustAdventure {{found that the}} {{interface}} was still <b>clunky.</b> Charles Onyett of IGN said that those who had played through the previous Uru content would not find many changes: [...] "As a result, Myst veterans uninterested in plugging through Urus content again will be left with a dearth of things to actually do, shifting the onus of gameplay creation to the community." [...] Onyett continued {{that the only reason}} to subscribe to the game was the dedicated fan community and the potential for the game to expand. Sarah Borger of GamesRadar noted that most puzzles could be completed without the help of other players, making the game [...] "a pretty chat room".|$|E
500|$|Milo premiered at the Sydney Theatre Company's Wharf 2 Theatre in October 1984 before {{productions}} at the Q Theatre, Theatre Up North in Townsville, Theatre South in Wollongong {{and regional}} performances. Milo {{has been recorded}} for Radio National, had numerous other productions, and also been published by Currency Press. However a 2001 production in Sydney was panned by the reviewer, who described it as [...] "formulaic and obvious, complete with <b>clunky</b> and unconvincing pat ending", and thought the play should be [...] "put out to pasture". The same year, The Australians reviewer was more positive, considering the performance to be [...] "passionate and funny. Seven years after it first appeared, it {{remains one of the}} best plays written about the bush-city divide".|$|E
500|$|A more {{negative}} review came from EW.com's Ken Tucker, {{who called the}} animation <b>clunky,</b> which he said made Hanna-Barbera's animation look like state-of-the-art. Tucker also said in his review that he hoped that smart people would use the Family Guy half-hour {{to turn off the}} television set and start a debate over the air strikes in Kosovo. He also called the show [...] "The Simpsons as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows". Even before it aired the pilot had received some criticism from the Parents Television Council, a watchdog; the creator of this website L. Brent Bozell III wrote that he initially speculated that Family Guy would be [...] "pushing the envelope".|$|E
5000|$|This {{requirement}} {{is a basic}} tenet of web accessibility, to ensure that JavaScript-enhanced websites are not only usable by people of all abilities and disabilities but that all users - whatever their computing platform - get equal {{access to all the}} site's information and functionality. Sometimes there is extra work involved in achieving this, but web accessibility is not an optional extra in many countries. For example, in the UK, the Equality Act 2010, while it does not refer explicitly to website accessibility, makes it illegal to discriminate against people with disabilities and applies to anyone providing any service in the public, private and voluntary sectors. [...] While a lot of effort may be put into designing and implementing a slick client-side user interface in unobtrusive JavaScript, it will not remain unobtrusive to a user without client-side scripting if they find that they cannot access published information. To meet this goal, it is often necessary to implement equivalent, albeit <b>clunkier,</b> server-side functionality that will be available without the use of JavaScript at all.|$|R
30|$|Surprisingly, {{however, the}} new search engine was not widely adopted; in fact, {{only a handful}} of analysts {{expressed}} interest in getting the interface installed on their desktop machines. In discussing this mystery with the research and development team and with some of the agency’s analysts, it became apparent that the older, <b>clunkier</b> search engine had considerable inertia in the work environment. For one thing, it was well-integrated into the suite of commercial tools that most analysts were already using. Not only would switching to the new search engine require additional steps to export and import data, but searching the database was only one of many tasks analysts did in a day, and time spent retrieving information was relatively low compared to other work tasks. In addition, because of cyber security concerns, the agency’s software acquisition policies required extensive review of new code, even when developed internally. Lastly, as one analyst explained, she had “grown up” using the older search engine and felt comfortable with it. She believed her peers felt similarly; after all, it did not appear that using the existing search engine was hurting her group’s overall performance. Such factors made it difficult for the research group’s innovation to gain the momentum necessary for successful adoption.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the four}} reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly {{complained that the}} game's single player mode is {{difficult}} {{to the point of}} being inaccessible, all but one of them gave the Genesis version a positive recommendation, citing the diversity of missions, strong challenge, and impressive animations. They scored it a 7.25 out of 10 average. They were evenly split on the Super NES version, with two of them recommending it based on the diversity of levels, and the other two focusing on the frustratingly difficult single player mode and the confusing controls. They scored it a 6.75 out of 10 average. A critic for Next Generation gave it three out of five stars, assessing that compared to the Genesis original it has sharper graphics but <b>clunkier</b> animation and worse control. He praised the game itself for its frantic, challenging onslaught of enemies. GamePros Scary Larry was uneasy at how the two-player mode demands that the two players be in perfect sync with each other, and said that the failure to do so could lead to bitter arguments. He also criticized the undetailed graphics, choppy animation, and limited sound effects, but recommended the game for its challenging, strategic, and overall fun gameplay.|$|R
500|$|Many actresses {{who read}} for Phoebe {{arrived at the}} {{audition}} in character, wearing [...] "bell bottoms and <b>clunky</b> shoes and nose rings". [...] Kathy Griffin and Jane Lynch auditioned for the role. Lisa Kudrow won the role because the producers liked her as Ursula, the waitress in Mad About You. She was second to be cast, though there was about a month between her and Schwimmer being signed on. Many of the actors seen by Moonves were [...] "too theatrical" [...] in performing comedy; Crane described the six successful actors as being {{the only ones who}} [...] "nailed" [...] their parts. The six actors {{met for the first time}} altogether at the read-through on April 28, 1994. John Allen Nelson and Clea Lewis guest-star as Paul and Franny, Monica's date and co-worker respectively. Cynthia Mann appears as a Central Perk waitress.|$|E
500|$|Sales of the North American {{version of}} Dragon Warrior VII reached about 200,000 copies {{according}} to The Magic Box, {{which was not}} nearly as stellar as its Japanese counterpart. Enix of America still expressed their satisfaction with the sales figures. Dragon Warrior VII met with mostly positive reviews from North American critics. IGN noted that all [...] "100+ hours" [...] of the game are enjoyable despite the dated visuals and <b>clunky</b> presentation. GameZone.com praised the game's concept and nostalgia factor and cited it as [...] "what role-playing games were meant to be." [...] They also noted the game's high difficulty, which, instead of making the game frustrating, they say, [...] "make it that much more of an accomplishment when you complete a quest." [...] IGN described the game's class system as [...] "one of the best class systems seen outside a strategy RPG." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "rubber band" [...] {{multiplayer}} mechanic {{was largely}} panned despite being acknowledged {{as an effort}} to innovate. IGN admired the attempt to both [...] "breathe life into a series that was running out of steam" [...] and fix the lopsided multiplayer aspect of Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 (1994) where Tails would always get lost off-screen. But, they ultimately disliked the <b>clunky</b> nature of the tethering physics and felt it took some time getting used to. Electronic Gaming Monthly felt the mechanic added originality, but noted it often slowed down the gameplay, as did GamesRadar. On the other hand, Next Generation felt the bond was tiring and not truly innovative, and GamePro called the bond mechanic's controls Knuckles' Chaotixs biggest problem, finding them frustrating and choppy. The reviewer also noted that the bond complicated gameplay and compared it to being handcuffed.|$|E
5000|$|Reviews in North America {{were mixed}} to positive. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly {{generally}} found the game worth getting for its high quality sound and lengthy quest. Though Mark Lefebvre felt the graphics were below average {{and that the}} game overall [...] "could {{have been a little}} better", the other three reviewers were more enthusiastic, praising the graphics and the shaman mechanic. GamePros Major Mike was also impressed with the sheer length of the RPG. While remarking that there are very few cinematic scenes compared to the first Breath of Fire, he was pleased with the complexity of both the main story and most of the side quests. He also complimented the graphics and the change to different musical themes halfway through the game, and summarized, [...] "This long, absorbing game offers plenty of story turns, intense battles, and intriguing characters." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation said that the game [...] "is larger and more involved than its predecessor, but unfortunately also much less interesting. While some parts are very clever (you are able to build your home town, populating it with stray homeless folks you run across), it suffers from too little direction, a purely mechanical storyline, and the <b>clunkiest</b> dialogue since Night Trap." ...|$|R
5000|$|The album {{received}} mostly favourable {{reviews from}} music critics. Jon O'Brien wrote for AllMusic that [...] "Battleground, is disappointingly {{a little more}} pedestrian than its predecessor", writing that [...] "Battleground should still consolidate their position as heirs to the boy band throne, but {{with the likes of}} One Direction now snapping at their heels, they'll have to rediscover their inventive streak in the future if they are to ever take the crown." [...] Nick Levine wrote for BBC that the album is [...] "a solid pop platter that's not lacking in personality - even if the latter does manifest itself in a smattering of lyrics <b>clunkier</b> than testing day at the seat belt factory." [...] Robert Copsey wrote for Digital Spy that [...] "Though the end result shows that they may have taken the battle of the boybands a touch too seriously, much to their credit they come out the other side largely unscathed." [...] David Griffiths wrote for 4Music that [...] "it's an album which wisely leaves the listener wanting more and suggests that this is a band with a very bright future." [...] Matthew Horton wrote a mixed review for Virgin Media that [...] "It's a curiously bloodless affair though, with none of the boys yet to establish an identity, and too much sails past without leaving an impression." ...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{were more}} {{critical}} with David Pollock in The Independent writing: [...] "There’s {{quite a bit}} to recommend here, including a great cast, a stunningly ambitious rotating pedestal of sets designed by Francis O’Connor and a whodunit reveal which is typically Rankin, satisfyingly obvious and unexpected all at once" [...] but {{went on to say}} that the play was [...] "essentially still the work of a debut playwright" [...] and that it was the fate of the female leads [...] "Isobel and Alexandra which leave the sourest taste in the mouth: neither ultimately in control, both manipulated at best, or simply portrayed as being too weak and soft of will to win the games of brutish men." [...] Mark Fisher in The Guardian wrote: [...] "Thomson draws out a set of ferocious performances in a pacy production that papers over the more implausible corners of the plot and the <b>clunkier</b> passages of exposition. What's harder to transcend is the hermetic nature of the genre: when everything rests on solving the mystery, there's little room for metaphor. Rankin goes some way to dealing with this by developing a theme about living with the consequences of guilty secrets and half-remembered mistakes, but by the end, when the play lurches into Victorian melodrama, we're left with the empty feeling of a story which, however well told, lacks resonance." ...|$|R
500|$|Criticism was {{directed}} at the game's quick-time sequences. Kotakus Narcisse considered them <b>clunky,</b> and Eurogamer's Matulef {{found them to be}} [...] "poorly constructed". Game Informers Gwaltney similarly felt them to be [...] "shoehorned" [...] in between dialogue encounters. Kill Screens Kriss wrote that such sequences are featured in games like The Walking Dead (2012) to reinforce a sense of urgency in players, but felt that this is unnecessary in 1979 Revolution, as [...] "the tension already feels real enough". The game's visuals also received mixed responses. Game Informers Gwaltney considered the art and environments [...] "impeccable", but criticized the character models; Eurogamer's Matulef likewise condemned the models and textures, describing the graphics as [...] "competent at best and an eyesore at worst". IGN's Rad echoed similar remarks, identifying awkward animations of background characters, and Gameplanet's Todd felt that 1979 Revolution [...] "lacks the polish" [...] of works by Telltale Games.|$|E
500|$|The comic's story also {{received}} positive reactions. Following the Nerds Bowling called it [...] "extremely well-written", commending {{its ability to}} attract readers and make them empathize with the characters. Paltridge of PopGeeks declared the story [...] "even better" [...] than Druckmann's work on The Last of Us (2013). Ellner of The Pullbox praised the story, noting a particular connection with the character of Johnny early in the story. Lopez of Fanboy Comics found that the [...] "character complexity is a bit lacking", but felt that the pacing {{of the story is}} helpful in understanding plot points. Doreen Sheridan, writing for I Want My Two Dollars!, felt that the [...] "dialogue is a little <b>clunky,</b> but it's a satisfying read nonetheless". ComicBuzzs Murray criticized the short length of the story, commenting on the lack of time dedicated to providing depth for the characters or plot.|$|E
500|$|Polly Shulman of The New York Times finds Quicksilver hard {{to follow}} and amazingly complex {{but a good}} read. However she notes that the {{complicated}} and <b>clunky</b> dialogue between the characters is a distraction. [...] She thinks a full appreciation {{of the work is}} only possible {{within the context of the}} remaining novels of The Baroque Cycle, and compares the novel to works by Dorothy Dunnett, William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, calling it [...] "history-of-science fiction". In the post-publication review for The New York Times, Edward Rothstein remarks that the scope of the novel is at times detrimental: [...] "Unfortunately, in this novelistic cauldron it can sometimes seem as if mercury's vapors had overtaken the author himself, as if every detail he had learned had to be anxiously crammed into his text, while still leaving the boundaries between fact and invention ambiguous". He considers the novel to be an [...] "experiment in progress", although the historical background is compelling.|$|E
40|$|Courts and {{scholars}} have long sought {{to illuminate the}} relationship between state and federal constitutional law. Yet their attention, like the relationship itself, has largely been one-sided: State courts have consistently adopted federal constitutional law as their own, {{and scholars}} have attempted to illuminate why this is, and why it {{should or should not}} be so. By contrast, federal courts tend not to look to state constitutional law, even for persuasive authority. Nor have scholars argued at any length that federal courts can or should look to state constitutional law for guidance in answering the many constitutional questions common to the federal and state systems. This short Article attempts to turn the focus around, by asking what state constitutional law can tell us about the federal constitution. The thesis explored here is that federal constitutional doctrine can and sometimes should do more to draw on state constitutional law, particularly when that law addresses—as it often does—analogous language or problems with which the federal courts have little experience. The Article calls this idea “reverse incorporation” {{for lack of a better}} phrase, but “federal constitutional borrowing of state constitutional law” would probably be more accurate, if a bit <b>clunkier.</b> In any event, the phrase is not meant to invoke the “reverse” incorporation associated with Bolling v. Sharpe, 1 but to denote a wide range of “uses”: from looking to state doctrine as persuasive authority in federal cases to using it to define federal law. Elsewhere, I have described this thesis in depth, considered some of the arguments for and against it, and sketched out some tentative normative claims about when and how federal constitutional law should draw more from state constitutional law. 2 This short piece presents an abbreviated version of the major arguments for and against such borrowing. It then goes on to address how reverse incorporation, like any interpretive tool, must be tailored to one’s preferred constitutional theory and to the particular constitutional issue presented. An originalist and a pragmatist will have very different uses for state constitutional law, for example, and will use it differently in Eighth Amendment cases than in Due Process cases. After identifying some of the concerns relevant to that kind of theory—and issue-tailoring, the Article concludes by addressing some general questions about the normative vision behind reverse incorporation...|$|R
500|$|... "Stephen" [...] {{received}} positive {{comments from}} music critics. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music used [...] "Stephen" [...] {{as an example}} of the songs on Animal that exemplified the singer's vocals, saying it had [...] "beautiful layered a cappella harmonies. Sure, it tumbles into <b>clunky</b> pop straight afterwards, but then, that also seems to be what she does: beautiful things are bashed against ugly things, pretty melodies ruined by silly noises, emotional lyrics stuffed with buzzwords." [...] Daniel Brockman of The Boston Phoenix wrote of the album that [...] "in a post–'Birthday Sex' pop landscape, there's plenty of room for dumb if it's done well." [...] He described [...] "Stephen" [...] as [...] "an ode to forcing your sexual advances on your high-school history teacher."

I cannot tell a lie; I’m a little underwhelmed by this new walk-the-plank Pirate incarnation." [...] William Goodman of Spin magazine was more critical and dismissive of the song, saying [...] "Wait Your Turn'...leaked online over the weekend, and like the album's lead track, 'Russian Roulette,' it's a total let down: <b>clunky,</b> Auto-Tuned vocals repeat The wait is ova / The wait is ova ad nauseam, over dark atmospherics and a spare dub beat that fails to connect...it's certainly not worth the wait." ...|$|E
