Laboratory consolidation tests are performed on dredged fill of high water content from 110 percent to 150 percent in the Qianwan area Shenzhen by GDS <b>consolidation</b> <b>test</b> systems, the results are shown as follows: compression strain of dredged fill is 24. 73 percent under small and first level consolidation pressure, which is approximately half of cumulative compression strain under whole consolidation pressure; Compression parameters including compression coefficient, bulk compression coefficient and compression modulus has a significant variation with void ratio decreasing under consolidation pressure from 6 kPa to 400 kPa, the variation of which is from several times to a hundred times, and the nonlinear power function relationship of consolidation pressure-void ratio is shown.

Pocket penetrometer is a simple tool that can be easily used in field and laboratory to initially predict unconfined compressive strength for clayey soils.

Geotechnical analyses included index-property and sediment characterization, and consolidation, permeability, and triaxial testing. Excellent agreement exists between test data generated in this multilaboratory effort. Sediment characterization and index-property data delineate three well-defined units that conform with major lithologic divisions. Within Subunit IA these data appear inconsistent with accepted geotechnical relationships, showing water content, plasticity, and grain size increasing over similar intervals. These unusual relationships are attributed, in part, to silt-sized bonded clay aggregates. Within Subunit IB geotechnical properties become more uniform, and a marked increase in X-ray amorphous material occurs below 28 m sub-bottom.
