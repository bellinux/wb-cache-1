50|$|Underfloor heating {{can have}} a {{positive}} effect on the quality of indoor air by facilitating the choice of otherwise perceived cold flooring materials such as tile, slate, terrazzo and concrete. These masonry surfaces typically have very low VOC emissions (volatile organic compounds) in comparison to other flooring options. In conjunction with moisture control, floor heating also establishes temperature conditions that are less favorable in supporting mold, bacteria, viruses and dust mites. By removing the sensible heating load from the total HVAC (Heating, Ventilating, and Air <b>Conditioning)</b> <b>load,</b> ventilation, filtration and dehumidification of incoming air can be accomplished with dedicated outdoor air systems having less volumetric turnover to mitigate distribution of airborne contaminates. There is recognition from the medical community relating to the benefits of floor heating especially as it relates to allergens.|$|E

The finite difference method (FDM) is effective in solving partial differential equations, and correct grid spacings, including temperature step and time step, are essential because the improper grid spacings will lead to inaccurate solutions. In [22], the grid spacing was selected for the linear second-order parabolic partial differential equation with defined boundary conditions.

It allows the customer's electricity use for cooling to be shifted to off peak period, benefiting both the consumer and the utility.

In this paper, a methodology {{is presented to}} determine the optimal chilled water storage (CWS) capacity and corresponding operating strategy for the air <b>conditioning</b> <b>loads</b> for different electricity tariffs. This model minimizes the total operating cost of the air conditioning plant by a trade-off between the cost involved for providing the storage and accessories and savings achieved under the specified, electricity tariff.
