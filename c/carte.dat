5|$|Because of {{the carpet}} quarrel, Gilbert had vowed to write no {{more for the}} Savoy. When The Gondoliers closed in 1891, <b>Carte</b> needed new authors and composers to write works for the Savoy Theatre. He turned to old friends George Dance, Frank Desprez and Edward Solomon for his next piece, The Nautch Girl, which ran for a {{satisfying}} 200 performances in 1891–92. <b>Carte</b> then revived Solomon and Sydney Grundy's The Vicar of Bray, which ran through the summer of 1892. Next came Grundy and Sullivan's Haddon Hall, which held the stage until April 1893. While <b>Carte</b> presented new pieces and revivals at the Savoy, his touring companies continued to play throughout Britain and in America. In 1894, for example, <b>Carte</b> had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America.|$|E

5|$|<b>Carte</b> finally {{assembled}} a syndicate in 1877 and formed the Comedy Opera Company {{to launch a}} series of original English comic operas, beginning with a third collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan, The Sorcerer, in November 1877. This work was a modest success, and H.M.S. Pinafore followed in May 1878. Despite a slow start, mainly due to a scorching summer, Pinafore became a red-hot favourite by autumn. After a dispute with <b>Carte</b> over the division of profits, the other Comedy Opera Company partners hired thugs to storm the theatre one night to steal the sets and costumes, intending to mount a rival production. The attempt was repelled by stagehands {{and others at the}} theatre loyal to <b>Carte,</b> and <b>Carte</b> continued as sole impresario of the newly renamed D'Oyly <b>Carte</b> Opera Company. Indeed, Pinafore was so successful that over a hundred unauthorised productions sprang up in America alone. Gilbert, Sullivan and <b>Carte</b> tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas, without success.|$|E

5|$|<b>Carte</b> {{started his}} career working for his father, Richard <b>Carte,</b> in the music {{publishing}} and musical instrument manufacturing business. As a young man, he conducted and composed music, but he soon turned to promoting the entertainment careers of others through his management agency. <b>Carte</b> believed that a school of wholesome, well-crafted, family-friendly, English comic opera could be as popular as the risqué French works dominating the London musical stage in the 1870s. To that end, he brought together the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan and, together with his wife Helen <b>Carte,</b> he nurtured their collaboration {{on a series of}} thirteen Savoy operas. He founded the D'Oyly <b>Carte</b> Opera Company and built the state-of-the-art Savoy Theatre to host the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carte,</b> Gilbert and Sullivan now had the {{financial}} resources to produce shows themselves, without outside backers. <b>Carte</b> persuaded the author and composer that a business partnership among the three would be to their advantage, and they hatched a plan to separate themselves from {{the directors of the}} Comedy Opera Company. The contract between Gilbert and Sullivan and the Comedy Opera Company gave the latter the right to present Pinafore {{for the duration of the}} initial run. The Opera Comique was obliged to close for drain and sewer repairs, and it was renovated by E. W. Bradwell, from Christmas 1878 to the end of January 1879. Gilbert, Sullivan and <b>Carte</b> believed that this break ended the initial run, and, therefore, ended the company's rights. <b>Carte</b> put the matter beyond doubt by taking a six-month personal lease of the theatre beginning on 1 February 1879, the date of its re-opening, when Pinafore resumed. At the end of the six months, <b>Carte</b> planned to give notice to the Comedy Opera Company that its rights in the show and the theatre had ended.|$|E
5|$|On 31 July 1879, {{the last}} day of their {{agreement}} with <b>Carte,</b> the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the Pinafore set by force during a performance, causing a celebrated fracas. Carte's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery and props. The Comedy Opera Company opened a rival production of H.M.S. Pinafore in London, but it was not as popular as the D'Oyly <b>Carte</b> production and soon closed. Legal action over the ownership of the rights ended in victory for <b>Carte,</b> Gilbert and Sullivan. From 1 August 1879, the new company, later called the D'Oyly <b>Carte</b> Opera Company, became the sole authorised producer of the works of Gilbert and Sullivan.|$|E

5|$|Rupert D'Oyly <b>Carte</b> (3 November 1876 – 12 September 1948) was an English hotelier, theatre {{owner and}} impresario, {{best known as}} {{proprietor}} of the D'Oyly <b>Carte</b> Opera Company and Savoy Hotel from 1913 to 1948.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the later}} 1890s, Carte's health was in decline, and Helen assumed {{more and more}} of the {{responsibilities}} for the opera company. She profitably managed the theatre and the provincial touring companies. In 1894, <b>Carte</b> had hired his son, Rupert, as an assistant. While <b>Carte</b> was ill, in 1897, Rupert assisted Mrs. <b>Carte</b> and W. S. Gilbert with the first revival of The Yeomen of the Guard at the Savoy. The Savoy put on a number of shows for comparatively short runs during this period, including Sullivan's The Beauty Stone, which ran for only 50 performances, in 1898. In 1899, <b>Carte</b> finally had a new success with Sullivan and Basil Hood's The Rose of Persia, which ran for 213 performances. Neither <b>Carte</b> nor Sullivan lived to see the production of the next piece by Hood, The Emerald Isle, for which Edward German completed Sullivan's unfinished score.|$|E
5|$|After {{the opera}} became {{successful}} in London, Richard D'Oyly <b>Carte</b> quickly sent touring companies into the British provinces. At least one D'Oyly <b>Carte</b> company, and sometimes {{as many as}} three, played Pinafore under Carte's aegis every year between 1878 and 1888, including its first London revival in 1887. The opera was then given a rest, returning to the touring repertory between 1894 and 1900 and again {{for most of the}} time between 1903 and 1940. Gilbert directed all the revivals during his lifetime, and after his death, the D'Oyly <b>Carte</b> Opera Company had exclusive performing rights to the Savoy operas until 1962. It continued to hew closely to Gilbert's directions throughout that period, as recorded in Gilbert's prompt books, and it also required its licensees to follow them closely.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, Gilbert and Sullivan were {{suddenly}} in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly <b>Carte</b> and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. <b>Carte</b> proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, <b>Carte</b> requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E
5|$|Carte's London {{house was}} at the Adelphi, {{not far from the}} Savoy. Passionate about the visual arts as well as the {{performing}} arts, <b>Carte</b> invited his friend, the artist James McNeill Whistler, to decorate the house. Whistler had the entire billiard room painted the colour of the billiard cloth, and elsewhere painted his favourite yellow with his own hand. Equally enthusiastic for technological innovation, <b>Carte</b> installed a lift, the first in a private house in England. Around 1890, he bought a small island in the River Thames, between Weybridge and Shepperton, called Folly Eyot, which he renamed D'Oyly <b>Carte</b> Island. He wanted to use the island as an annex to his new Savoy Hotel, but the local authorities refused to grant him a drinks licence for the property. Instead, he built Eyot House, a large house and garden on the island, that he used as a residence. In later years, <b>Carte</b> displayed his macabre sense of humour by keeping a crocodile on the island.|$|E
5|$|During the company's 1975 centennial {{performances}} of all thirteen Gilbert and Sullivan Operas at the Savoy Theatre, Trial was given four times, as a curtain raiser to The Sorcerer, Pinafore and Pirates {{and as an}} afterpiece following The Grand Duke. Before {{the first of the}} four {{performances of}} Trial, a specially written curtain raiser by William Douglas-Home, called Dramatic Licence, was played by Peter Pratt as <b>Carte,</b> Kenneth Sandford as Gilbert and John Ayldon as Sullivan, in which Gilbert, Sullivan and <b>Carte</b> plan the birth of Trial in 1875. Trial by Jury was eliminated from the D'Oyly <b>Carte</b> repertory in 1976 as a cost-saving measure.|$|E

5|$|Even {{after the}} initial {{production}} of Trial by Jury, however, <b>Carte</b> continued to produce continental operetta, touring {{in the summer of}} 1876 with a repertoire consisting of English adaptations of French opera bouffe (Offenbach’s La Périchole, and La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein, Lecocq's La fille de Madame Angot and Léon Vasseur's La Timbale d'argent), paired with two one-act English after-pieces (Happy Hampstead and Trial by Jury). <b>Carte</b> acted as the musical director of this travelling company that included W.H. Denny.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's aggressive, though successful, {{legal action}} had embittered <b>Carte</b> and Sullivan, but the {{partnership}} {{had been so}} profitable that <b>Carte</b> and his wife eventually sought to reunite the author and composer. After several attempts by the Cartes, the reconciliation finally came {{through the efforts of}} Tom Chappell, who published the sheet music to their operas. In 1893, Gilbert and Sullivan produced their penultimate collaboration, Utopia, Limited. While Utopia was being prepared, <b>Carte</b> produced Jane Annie, by J. M. Barrie and Arthur Conan Doyle, with music by Ernest Ford. Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle, the show was a flop, closing after only 51 performances.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert, Sullivan and <b>Carte</b> met by 24 April 1879 to {{make plans}} for a {{production}} of Pinafore in America. <b>Carte</b> travelled to New York {{in the summer of}} 1879 and made arrangements with theatre manager John T. Ford to present, at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, the first authorised American production of Pinafore. In November, <b>Carte</b> returned to America with Gilbert, Sullivan and a company of strong singers, including J. H. Ryley as Sir Joseph, Blanche Roosevelt as Josephine, Alice Barnett as Little Buttercup, Furneaux Cook as Dick Deadeye, Hugh Talbot as Ralph Rackstraw and Jessie Bond as Cousin Hebe. To these, he added some American singers, including Signor Brocolini as Captain Corcoran. Alfred Cellier came to assist Sullivan, while his brother François remained in London to conduct Pinafore there.|$|E

5|$|H.M.S. Pinafore was so {{successful}} that <b>Carte</b> soon sent two additional companies out to tour in the provinces. The opera ran for 571 performances in London, the second-longest run in musical theatre history up to that time. Over 150 unauthorised productions sprang up in America alone, but because American law then offered no copyright protection to foreigners, <b>Carte,</b> Gilbert and Sullivan {{were not able to}} demand royalties from, or to control the artistic content of, these productions.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Richard D'Oyly <b>Carte,</b> who {{was then}} {{managing}} the Royalty Theatre for Selina Dolaro, brought Gilbert and Sullivan together to write their second show, a one-act opera entitled Trial by Jury. This proved a success, and in 1876 D'Oyly <b>Carte</b> assembled a group of financial backers to establish the Comedy Opera Company, which was devoted to the production and promotion of family-friendly English comic opera. With this theatre company, <b>Carte</b> finally had the financial resources, after many failed attempts, to produce a new full-length Gilbert and Sullivan opera. This next opera was The Sorcerer, which opened in November 1877. It too was successful, running for 178performances. Sheet music from the show sold well, and street musicians played the melodies.|$|E
