5|$|Where it was {{necessary}} for the pipeline to curve to fit the route, the steel pipes were bent, using either a cold-bending approach, in which tractors would pull and push the pipelines into position, or a hot-bending method, with the pipe heated up by blow-torches and pulled into place using a jig. A new, specialized piece of equipment for bending pipes, the Cummings bending jig, was invented during the Big Inch build, and used on the construction of the Little Big Inch pipeline. To protect the pipeline from corrosion, its outside was then cleaned by machine, and painted in first a layer of <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> enamel, and then hot <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> coating, before being wrapped in asbestos felt. Finally the pipeline was lowered into position, taking care not to damage the ends of the pipes; the larger pipes were so heavy that they required a D-8 caterpillar tractor equipped with counter-weights to lift them. The trench was then back-filled, completing the process.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{colliery}} site had become crowded, and included a brickworks that used fireclay and shale spoil from the pit. It was surrounded by housing and factories in what {{was one of the most}} industrial parts of Manchester. The ready supply of coal encouraged the development of Manchester's chemical industry around the colliery and in the northeast of the city generally. A factory producing carbolic acid from <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> was established in 1857, and sulphuric acid and naphthalene were produced from 1865 in nearby Blackley, later the site of ICI's Dyestuff's Division.|$|E
5|$|After {{exceeding}} the original departure time limit by a half-hour, Bockscar, accompanied by The Great Artiste, proceeded to Kokura, thirty minutes away. The delay at the rendezvous {{had resulted in}} clouds and drifting smoke over Kokura from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. Additionally, the Yawata Steel Works intentionally burned <b>coal</b> <b>tar,</b> to produce black smoke. The clouds and smoke resulted in 70% of the area over Kokura being covered, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and exposing the aircraft repeatedly to the heavy defenses of Yawata, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By {{the time of the}} third bomb run, Japanese antiaircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant Jacob Beser, who was monitoring Japanese communications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.|$|E

5|$|Salicylate medicines—including salicin, {{salicylic}} acid, {{and sodium}} salicylate— were difficult and wasteful to extract from plants, and in 1860 Hermann Kolbe {{worked out a}} way to synthesize salicylic acid. Throughout the late 1800s use of salicylates grew considerably, and physicians increasingly knew what to expect from these medicines: reduction of pain, fever, and inflammation. However, the unpleasant side effects, particularly gastric irritation, limited their usefulness, as did their intense bitterness. By the 1880s, the German chemical industry, jump-started by the lucrative development of dyes from <b>coal</b> <b>tar,</b> was branching out to investigate the potential of new tar-derived medicines. The turning point was the advent of Kalle & Company's Antifebrine, the branded version of the well-known dye derivative acetanilide—the fever-reducing properties of which were discovered by accident in 1886. Antifebrine's success inspired Carl Duisberg, the head of research at the small dye firm Friedrich Bayer & Company, to start a systematic search for other chemical fever-reducers. Bayer chemists soon developed Phenacetin, followed by the sedatives Sulfonal and Trional.|$|E

25|$|Naphthalene is {{the most}} {{abundant}} single component of <b>coal</b> <b>tar.</b> Although the composition of <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> varies with the coal from which it is produced, typical <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> is about 10% naphthalene by weight. In industrial practice, distillation of <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> yields an oil containing about 50% naphthalene, along with twelve other aromatic compounds. This oil, after being washed with aqueous sodium hydroxide to remove acidic components (chiefly various phenols), and with sulfuric acid to remove basic components, undergoes fractional distillation to isolate naphthalene. The crude naphthalene resulting from this process is about 95% naphthalene by weight. The chief impurities are the sulfur-containing aromatic compound benzothiophene (<nbsp&2%), indane (0.2%), indene (<nbsp&2%), and methylnaphthalene (<nbsp&2%). Petroleum-derived naphthalene is usually purer than that derived from <b>coal</b> <b>tar.</b> Where required, crude naphthalene can be further purified by recrystallization from any {{of a variety of}} solvents, resulting in 99% naphthalene by weight, referred to as 80nbsp&°C (melting point). Approximately 1.3M tons are produced annually.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{pyridine}} was {{extracted from}} <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> or obtained as {{a byproduct of}} coal gasification. The process was labor-consuming and inefficient: <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> contains only about 0.1% pyridine, and therefore a multi-stage purification was required, which further reduced the output.

25|$|Historically, PAHs contributed {{substantially}} to {{our understanding}} of adverse health effects from exposures to environmental contaminants, including chemical carcinogenesis. In 1775, Percivall Pott, a surgeon at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, observed that scrotal cancer was unusually common in chimney sweepers and proposed the cause as occupational exposure to soot. A century later, Richard von Volkmann reported increased skin cancers in workers of the <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> industry of Germany, and by the early 1900s increased rates of cancer from exposure to soot and <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> was widely accepted.

25|$|The term {{creosote}} has a {{broad range}} of definitions depending on the origin of the <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> oil and end use of the material.|$|E
25|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has {{determined}} that <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> creosote is probably carcinogenic to humans, based on adequate animal evidence and limited human evidence.

After weeks of creosote application, the animals developed cancerous skin lesions and in one test, lesions of the lung. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has stated that <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> creosote is a probable human carcinogen based on both human and animal studies. As a result, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set a permissible exposure limit of 0.2 milligrams of <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> creosote per cubic meter of air (0.2mg/m3) in the workplace during an 8-hour day, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that spills or accidental releases into the environment of one pound (0.454kg) or more of creosote be reported to them.|$|E
