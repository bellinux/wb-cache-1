40|$|Resistance to Mosaic Disease of M. glaviozii by Grafting on M. Esculenta. African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) is an {{epidemic}} disease that causes great yield losses (> 50 %). The grafting {{in the field}} of M. glaziovii on 3 cultivars of M. esculenta (Alot- Bikon, IITA 8034 and IITA 8061), permitted to evaluate the number of leaves per plant and the evolution of ACMV four times at one month intervals starting from 30 days after planting and the tuber yield, which was determined after 11 months. <b>Crown</b> <b>grafting</b> was realised 100 days after cuttings were planted. Controls consisted of ungrafted plants of each cultivar. After four months development, average number of leaves on the scion and controls varied from 41. 3 - 50. 0 and 24. 2 - 45. 3 leaves per plant respectively, showing a significant difference (P Flu) by 11. 0 t/ha (about 40 %), compared to controls...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to identify the grafting method, which will have a higher success rate of scion development. The study was conducted at Mount Makulu Central Research station in Chilanga, Zambia (15 o 33 ’S / 28 o 11 ’E) from April 2010 to November 2011. The study had 4 vegetative propagation methods that varied in the treatment of the rootstock and scion. The four methods were Standard T- budding (STB); Modified TBudding with decapitation (TBD); T- budding with scion bending (TBB); <b>Crown</b> <b>grafting</b> (CG). Bud take, shoot growth, leaf emergence and Leaf area index were measured up to 11 weeks after treatment (WAT). With CG there was 100 % bud take. STB had a bud take of 58. 3 %. TBD had a bud take of 50 %. The lowest bud take percentage was recorded in TBB, which had a bud take of 41. 7 %. At 5 weeks the STB and TBB treatment had shoot length of 0. 7 and 1. 0 cm respectively which were the shortest; this was followed by the CG treatment at 15. 3 cm and the modified TBD with apical shoot decapitation (21. 7 cm). STB shoots did not start growing until about 5 weeks, which was 2 weeks after the rootstock was cut off. At 5 weeks, the TBB and STB were yet to form leaves. The CG had close to 20 leaves and the TBD had almost 15. 2 leaves. At the end of 11 weeks, the TBB had the highest number of leaves. Across the grafting methods; the Leaf area exhibited a pattern similar to leaf number; it kept on doubling every 2 weeks to until the 9 th week after which the increase was negligible. At 11 weeks, the highest leaf area was in the TBD followed by the STB and lowest in the CG treatment...|$|E

40|$|The {{strength}} {{of growth of}} 'Łutówka' trees {{was related to the}} soil quality and the rootstock. Measurements of the tree trunks and the crown size showed that on fertile soil the trees grafted on Mahaleb cherry grew worse, forming by 12 % thinner trunks and by over 20 % (significantly) smaller crowns as compared to Mazzard cherry trees. On poor sandy-loamy soil the <b>crowns</b> of trees <b>grafted</b> on Mahaleb were significantly, more than 40 % bigger than those on Mazzard cherry. No significant differences in the yielding and productivity of trees grafted on Mahaleb and Mazzard cherry trees were found on grey brown podzolic soil. The experiment conducted on sandy-loamy soil pointed to significant differences in the yielding and productivity between 'Łutówka' trees grafted on the studied rootstocks. The trees grafted on Mahaleb cherry in both studied years were characterized by significantly greater productivity than on the other rootstocks. Significantly higher yields were gathered from the trees on Mahaleb cherry than on vegetative rootstocks, and by 70 % higher than on Mazzard cherry. P-HL A rootstock is of little use in the planting of 'Łutówka', which grown poorly on light soils. Besides poor growth and yielding, in longer dry periods the studies found the appearance of chlorosis of magnesium on older leaves, and even wilting of the leaves...|$|R
40|$|The tree {{breeding}} {{industry is}} interested in early ontogenetic male cone production in Pinus radiata in order to maximise {{the rate at which}} successive generations can be bred. The foundation of this thesis was a study of how male cone production differed in various contrasting regions around New Zealand. A study was then carried out to assess whether various morphological and anatomical characteristics of trees were correlated with the onset of male cone production. Various treatments including stress, plant growth regulator application and grafting were examined to determine whether any of these could be used to promote early ontogenetic male cone production. The regional study found that male cone production commenced at age 3 in Nelson, at age 4 in Northern and Southern Kinleith, and age 6 in Karioi and Northland. Findings suggest that high sunshine hours and low autumn and/or winter temperatures are of significance to the precocity of male cone production. A tentative logistic model was developed that may adequately describe cone production across all regions. Morphological and anatomical characteristics of trees were used to develop a model which predicts the probability that a tree will not be producing male cones. Relative cell number was found to provide the greatest ability to predict whether or not a given tree will be producing male cones, supporting the hypothesis that a certain number of cell divisions are required before male cone production commences. Grafting did not promote male cone production in the present study. It is recommended that future grafting experiments for the purposes of promoting male cone production should reconsider the position within the <b>crown</b> at which <b>grafts</b> are made. Male cone production on fascicle cuttings approximately two years old was promoted by growing them under stress in small pots, with minimal watering and no fertiliser application. It is suggested that a "stress" pathway, distinct from the "normal" male cone production pathway is probably involved. Male cone promotion in fascicle cuttings appears to be enhanced through the application of ABA, but not other plant growth regulators. Additionally, male cone production in fascicle cuttings appears to be enhanced by providing relatively high levels of light. The outcomes {{of this study suggest that}} a lack of male cone production in young trees may not be the most serious impediment to the breeding program. Instead, the onus may be on the ability to make superior selections at a younger age than occurs at present...|$|R
