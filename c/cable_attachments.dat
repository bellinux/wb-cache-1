2500|$|Some {{references}} {{also use}} the term pedrail. The issue is further confused by Bottrill referring to his design as [...] "ped-rail shoes". [...] The two concepts are similar in that they attempt to improve cross-country performance by spreading out the load on a flat surface. The difference is primarily in how the pads are connected; the dreadnaught wheel connects the pads {{to each other and}} ride along the wheel, whereas in the pedal arrangement, introduced in 1903, each pad is connected to a pivot on the wheel itself, and there are no inter-pad connections. Some pedrail systems also include internal suspensions to improve their performance over rough ground. Bottrill's design spans the definition, as its <b>cable</b> <b>attachments</b> are similar to the pedrail connections, albeit much more simple.|$|E
5000|$|Washington, D.C. {{had a large}} {{network of}} conduit lines, to avoid wires. Some lines used {{overhead}} wires when they approached rural or suburban areas. The last such line ran to Cabin John, Maryland. The current collector [...] "plow" [...] was mounted underneath the car on a fitting just forward of the rear truck on PCC streetcars. It had two cables with female connectors on cables to attach to matching cables of the car's electrical system. A [...] "plowman" [...] was assigned at each changeover point from overhead trolley wire to conduit to remove the <b>cable</b> <b>attachments</b> {{to the car and}} stow the plow, which did not remain with the car and was reattached in an incoming car running on overhead wire. The lower section of the plow [...] "board" [...] was drawn by the moving car within the cavity of the conduit. Because of this usage, many of Washington's streetcars carried trolley poles, which were lowered while operating in {{the central part of the}} city; when the cars reached a point where they switched to overhead operation, they stopped over a plow pit where the conduit plows were detached and the trolley poles raised, the reverse operation taking place on inbound runs. The 'pit' here has the meaning analogous to racing circuit pits rather than a depression in the road.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{clinically}} examine the relationship between rotator cable integrity and the presence of pseudoparalysis. A retrospective review was performed of a consecutive series of arthroscopic repairs of massive rotator cuff tears performed between January 2007 and June 2009. A total of 127 massive tears were identified. Group 1 comprised 24 patients with preoperative pseudoparalysis. Group 2 comprised 97 patients (103 repairs) with active forward flexion more than 90 °. In group I, no patient maintained integrity of both rotator cable attachments; 1 rotator cable attachment was disrupted in 45. 8 % of cases; and both rotator <b>cable</b> <b>attachments</b> were disrupted in 54. 2 % of cases. In group II, both rotator <b>cable</b> <b>attachments</b> were intact in 22. 3 % of cases; 1 rotator cable attachment was disrupted in 62. 1 % of cases; and both rotator <b>cable</b> <b>attachments</b> were disrupted in 15. 5 % of cases. The difference in the distribution of <b>cable</b> <b>attachments</b> between the 2 groups was statistically significant (P<. 001). Overall, preoperative pseudoparalysis predicted a disruption of both rotator cables with 88. 8 % specificity, 44. 8 % sensitivity, and 77. 8 % accuracy. Pseudoparalysis requires the disruption of at least 1 rotator cable attachment. This study reinforces the concept of rotator cable integrity and the ability of patients to maintain forward flexion above shoulder level and highlights the importance of reinforcing the rotator <b>cable</b> <b>attachments</b> in the repair of massive rotator cuff tears...|$|E

The cabled beam is modeled as a double-beam system connected by springs at several discrete locations.

40|$|Rigid link {{manipulators}} (RLMs) {{are used}} in industry to move and manipulate objects in their workspaces. Flexible link manipulators (FLMs), which are much lighter and hence highly flexible compared to RLMs, have been proposed {{in the past as}} means to reduce energy consumption and increase the speed of operation. Unlike RLM, an FLM has infinite degrees of freedom actuated by finite number of actuators. Due to high flexibility affecting the precision of operation, special control algorithms are required to make them usable. Recently, a method to stiffen FLMs using cables, without adding significant inertia or adversely affecting the advantages of FLMs, has been proposed as a possible solution in a preliminary work by the authors. An FLM stiffened using cables can use existing control algorithms designed for RLMs. In this paper we discuss in detail the working principle and limitations of cable stiffening for flexible link manipulators through simulations and experiments. A systematic way of deciding the location of <b>cable</b> <b>attachments</b> to the FLM is also presented.

40|$|The {{original}} contribution to knowledge made by this research work is demonstrating {{the benefits of}} differentially fed balanced transmit antenna in modern communication system. Extensive experimental studies have established {{the fact that a}} true differential amplifier feeding a balanced antenna offers higher linearity and lower distortions compared to the single ended feeding technique, even while using the same amplifier. With continuing advancements in personal communications in this era of digital economy, the demand for wireless connectivity has grown radically, resulting in stringent performance requirement for RF components. Differential circuits are preferred choice in RFIC design due to its good noise immunity and low distortion characteristics. But it is observed that single ended PAs and LNAs are used for the feeding part because of the antenna industry’s tendency to stick to conventional 50 Ω interface. Therefore, differentially fed transmit balanced antenna is an area of current research, which has been studied in this thesis. The study was set out with a review of the state-of-the-art in active integrated antennas. Following that, the ground plane influence on antenna radiation pattern was explored and novel techniques to compensate the effects were presented. It was observed that the current flow in a coaxial cable also affects radiation pattern. Hence, a novel method was proposed to measure wireless devices in the anechoic chamber eradicating the need of any <b>cable</b> <b>attachments.</b> Broadband differential amplifiers were then reviewed with a view to feed balanced and unbalanced antennas for demonstrating the potential of differential feeding technique over the conventional one. The amplifier with differential output interface exhibited higher gain and linearity in both bench test and radiated power test. Further improvement in linearity was reported by lowering the output resistance of the amplifier. Afterwards, a broadband antenna with stable radiation pattern and impedance was designed to carry out radiated harmonic measurements, which illustrated that the fully differential output configuration possesses significantly lower harmonic distortion. All these measurement results have suggested that balanced antenna fed by differential amplifier can be the best solution for applications demanding higher output power, greater linearity and lower distortion. Therefore it is recommended to re-evaluate the idea of power amplifier and antenna interface in RF front-end designs...|$|E

Cable-suspended refers here to cable-driven parallel robots in a crane-like setting, where all the cable drawing points are located on top of the base frame, gravity being used to keep the cables taut. Geometry selection consists of determining the relative positions of the cable drawing points on the base frame and of the <b>cable</b> <b>attachment</b> points on the mobile platform together with the cable arrangement between these two sets of points. An original performance index is introduced. It is defined as the maximum acceptable distance between the mobile platform geometric center and the center of mass of the set consisting of the platform and a payload. This performance index is of particular interest in heavy payload handling applications. Used within a two-phase geometry selection strategy, it yields a new cable-suspended robot geometry having a very large workspace to footprint ratio and able to handle heavy payloads.

Specifically, this project aimed to develop and evaluate alternative attachment designs for the bolted, tabbed bracket and evaluate the use of a larger diameter, keeper rod for use in the top <b>cable</b> <b>attachment.</b> From a group of over 25 alternative attachment concepts, two tabbed bracket designs were selected for evaluation through dynamic component testing: 1) the lateral shear plate attachment and 2) the drop-in shear plate attachment. The drop-in shear plate concept did not perform as intended, as the vertical release load was too high and the lateral release loads were too low. Alternatively, the lateral shear plate design provided vertical and lateral release loads very similar to the original bolted, tabbed bracket V 10. However, concerns were raised over the lack of rigidity in the attachment and the ease of installations of the shear plate. Thus, it was recommended that the lateral shear plate design be modified and reevaluated prior to use in the full-scale system. Dynamic bogie or component testing of the 3 / 16 -in. (4. 8 -mm) diameter brass keeper rod provided a quick cable release similar to the previous design. The increased strength of the rod also showed promise in distributing impact loads more uniformly to adjacent posts and helping reduce system deflections. Thus, the 3 / 16 -in.

50|$|Three to {{five percent}} of the new mines dropped into the North Sea detonated as soon as the salt pellets dissolved; and hydrophones {{detected}} premature detonations continuing for a week after minelaying. These premature detonations were initially attributed to activation of the horn fuze detonation circuits by seawater leaking into the mines; and mine spacing was increased from 250 ft on the first minelaying excursion to 300 ft on subsequent excursions to minimize leakage caused by detonation of nearby mines. About one percent of the mines deployed during the first excursion broke free of their mooring cables and washed ashore in Norway within a month. Mines used for the last eleven excursions had springs installed at the mine mooring <b>cable</b> <b>attachment</b> points to buffer wave loading during storms. Premature detonations increased to 14 percent for the fourth minelaying excursion; because some mines had been assembled with the more sensitive antenna fuze relay settings made by the Bureau of Ordnance. The fifth minelaying excursion was halted when 19 percent of the mines detonated prematurely. San Francisco identified relay armature sensitivity as a major cause of premature detonations during a comparative field test minelaying excursion on August 12. Subsequent investigations revealed copper sulfate deposits caused by antenna corrosion created a weak battery increasing the probability of relay activation by shock wave accelerations when nearby mines detonated. Premature detonations dropped to four to six percent when sensitivity was adjusted to 30 to 45 millivolts for mines deployed by the last five minelaying excursions.|$|R
40|$|The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute’s (MBARI’s) 4000 meter {{remotely}} operated vehicle (ROV), Tiburon operates directly off a double helically wound steel cable {{without the use of}} a clump weight. On dives between 1500 and 4000 meters, rotationally induced hockles or tight bends in the umbilical cable have intermittently occurred. The hockles have the potential to disable and possibly even lose Tiburon. In an effort to compensate for this problem, MBARI engineers are designing a rotation sensor that clamps on the cable near the sections where hockles have occurred. A magnetic compass will take the heading of the cable and send the processed information acoustically back to the ship or vehicle. This information will appear on the ROV pilot’s display screen so that the ROV pilot can compensate for any rotation or misalignment before hockles occur.

However, there has been little study on the effects of additional mass on the board and rigidity of the board on drop test reliability. This paper examines the drop impact dynamic responses of the JEDEC JESD 22 -B 111 board. Of interest are the effects of an attached cable and rigidity of the board on the peak acceleration at different locations of the board. Fifteen 0. 5 mm pitch CSPs were assembled on the board using SnAg 3. 0 Cu 0. 5 lead free solder. The drop test was conducted using a Lansmont M 23 TTSII Shock Test system. A half-sine shock impact pulse of 1500 G with 0. 5 ms duration was applied to the drop table where the test vehicle was mounted.
