50|$|The Gregory Dipping Vat is a {{historic}} <b>cattle</b> <b>dipping</b> facility at 122 Rogers Street {{on the outskirts of}} Lake Village, Arkansas. The vat is a concrete structure 27 ft long, 4 ft wide, and 7 ft deep. It is located on a grassy lane off Rogers Road, in a wooded area not far from Bayou Macon, whose waters were used to fill it. The vat was built c. 1930 as part of a statewide program to eradicate Texas tick fever, which was at the time a serious problem affecting the area's cattle farmers. After the program was ended in 1943, the vat became a play area for local youth. It remains in good condition as a reminder of the economically important tick eradication program.|$|R
50|$|The Jim Wright Farmstead Historic District {{encompasses}} a well-preserved early 20th-century farmstead in rural White County, Arkansas. The property {{is located on}} the south side of Arkansas Highway 258, east of its junction with Arkansas Highway 323, northwest of Bald Knob. It includes a Craftsman style single-story wood frame farmhouse, with a wraparound porch supported by simple Doric columns, a simple wood-frame garage, and a single-story wood frame house for tenant workers. It also includes remnants of the farmstead's first house and barn, silo, and a <b>cattle</b> <b>dipping</b> vat. This land was homesteaded in 1860 by the parents of Jim Wright, who is credited with construction of most of the farmstead's surviving features, which were built between 1924 and 1940.|$|R

50|$|The {{central core}} of the cattle yards {{comprises}} crushes for de-horning, cutting, drafting, dipping, and branding. Surrounding the stock working facilities of the central core, are the receiving, forcing and holding yards. The de-horning and cutting crush, <b>cattle</b> <b>dip</b> and stock loading ramp are in better condition than most sections of the yards, possibly through having remained in use and repair until {{the closure of the}} station. The loading ramp was built in the early 1960s and is the most recent structure. The most substantial feature of the yards is the <b>cattle</b> <b>dip,</b> which is of the conventional design and construction. The dip was built during the O'Beirne's tenure and is the earliest surviving structure within the yards. The walls of the dip are of concrete with concrete rendered steps and pit. Bush timber uprights and rafters support a corrugated iron roof that covers the dip itself. Steps lead out of the dip to a concrete-surfaced draining and pound yard. Beyond the dip is a large circular holding yard over 50 metres in diameter which forms a significant feature of the stockyards.|$|E
50|$|Peachester Public Dip is a {{concrete}} formed <b>cattle</b> <b>dip</b> framed with slab posts and a sawn timber roof clad in corrugated iron sheeting. It dates from 1915 when it replaced an earlier timber dip built by Landsborough Shire Council on the site, {{which had been}} reserved as a Stock Dip Reserve in November 1910. These dips were erected {{in response to the}} spread of cattle tick into Queensland which threatened the cattle industry throughout the State and dairying in south-east Queensland.|$|E
50|$|The Sumner - White Dipping Vat is a {{historic}} concrete <b>cattle</b> <b>dipping</b> vat in Ashley County, Arkansas. It is located about four miles northeast of the intersectionof U.S. Highway 82 and County Road 69, half a mile in the woods northeast of the Sumner-White Hunt Club. The vat is a concrete structure about 27 ft long, 4 ft wide, and 7 ft deep. A U-shaped concrete structure, built about the same time, stands about 2 ft from the vat, near where cattle would have exited the vat. It was probably built c. 1915, when a statewide program was initiated for the eradication of Texas tick fever. The facilities were likely used until the program {{came to an end}} in 1943.|$|R
50|$|The Cogburn Dipping Vat is a {{historic}} former <b>cattle</b> <b>dipping</b> facility in Ouachita National Forest, west of Black Spring, Arkansas.

It is a U-shaped concrete structure, with a distinctive curved shape that matches {{the contours of the}} terrain, with a concrete pad at one end. The total length of the structure is about 13 m. It was built between 1930 and 1940 as part of a state program to eradicate Texas tick fever from the state's cattle. The vat's name derives from the Cogburn, who homesteaded a farm in the area, and probably built the vat to serve their needs and those of other nearby farmers.|$|R
60|$|We {{had waited}} a {{considerable}} time before Steel hailed {{us from the}} roof {{that he could see}} our enemies riding south behind a bunch of cattle, and we mounted forthwith. There were now three rifles among us, but we had agreed these were not to be used unless somebody fired upon us. Riders and <b>cattle</b> <b>dipped</b> into a hollow, and we had covered several miles before we sighted them again. Lane and the representative of authority no longer accompanied them. The whole body wheeled around and halted when we came up. There was sweet grass in the hollow, so the cattle halted too, and for a space we sat silent, looking at one another. I dare not risk a blunder in face of such odds, though I determined to make an effort to recover the stock.|$|R
