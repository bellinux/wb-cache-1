5|$|During the Japanese heyday in Middle Road, {{the area}} was synonymous with the Echigoya, a Japanese draper shop. The Echigoya sold high quality {{textiles}} to Japanese and non-Japanese customers alike. The textiles and clothing were stored in full-height timber cabinets that ran {{along the length of}} the ground level walls. On one length side, a raised platform was also constructed, known as Koagari, where <b>customers</b> <b>would</b> sit while they examine the merchandise.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} SmarTrip {{features}} {{that were supposed}} to be introduced in 2005 by SmarTrip's creator, Cubic Transportation Systems, were not fully implemented until 2012. Initially, riders could only add value to a SmarTrip card at Metrorail stations or by using cash while boarding a Metrobus. In November 2008, after years of delays, WMATA announced that <b>customers</b> <b>would</b> have the ability to add funds to their SmarTrip cards online by September 2009, but that deadline was missed. WMATA did launch SmarTrip's online reload feature in September 2011. WMATA allowed customers to load a seven-day unlimited Metrorail pass to their SmarTrip cards in April 2012.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Atari {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} produce home versions of Namco's arcade games. After Pac-Man {{proved to be a}} success in the United States, Atari decided to produce the game for its Atari 2600 console. The company believed the conversion would be simple because the arcade's success was attributed to the gameplay rather than impressive visuals. Development took around four months; the process started in May 1981 and finished in September. At the time, Atari projected 10million consoles were still actively used by video game enthusiasts. Atari decided to produce 12million game cartridges, anticipating every Atari 2600 owner would purchase the game, while two million new <b>customers</b> <b>would</b> purchase the system to play it; management predicted sales would reach at least US$500million.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{he started}} selling {{bicycles}} and motorbikes {{in a small}} shop in Brunswick Street, in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. He began selling and recharging batteries in 1925, opening a shop {{in the front room}} of his family's three-storey Georgian terraced house, called Phillips’ Battery Charging Depot, and had to install large accumulators in the cellar. Phillips ran the business for 30 years, even during WWII, but due to a decline in demand for batteries in the early 1950s (most people having electricity by then) he started selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; <b>customers</b> <b>would</b> buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy and sell the latest records from America via his contacts there.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{began taking}} pre-orders for the first-generation iPad on March 12, 2010. The only major {{change to the}} device between its {{announcement}} and being available to pre-order was the change {{of the behavior of}} the side switch to perform either sound muting or screen rotation locking (user selectable). The Wi-Fi version of the iPad went on sale in the United States on April 3, 2010. The Wi-Fi+3G version was released on April 30. 3G service in the United States is provided by AT and was initially sold with two prepaid contract-free data plan options: one for unlimited data and the other for 250MB per month at half the price. On June 2, 2010, AT announced that effective June 7 the unlimited plan would be replaced for new customers with a 2GB plan at slightly lower cost; existing <b>customers</b> <b>would</b> have the option to keep the unlimited plan. The plans are activated on the iPad itself and can be cancelled at any time.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{during its}} time under the {{ownership}} of Britain-based Grand Metropolitan, Burger King experimented with table service. After 4pm, <b>customers</b> <b>would</b> place their order at the counter, and their order would be brought to them at their table. Customers were given complimentary popcorn to eat while waiting for their meal. To coincide with the offering, a series of meals called the Dinner baskets were introduced. The dinner baskets included the Whopper Dinner Basket, Steak Sandwich Dinner Basket, Fried Chicken Dinner Basket, and Shrimp Dinner Basket. In the New England region of the United States, BK sold a Fried clam Basket. The dinner came with two sides, including a choice of a side salad, cole slaw, French fries, or baked potato. Lasting approximately a year, the sit-down restaurant concept was abandoned in 1994 {{in favor of the}} original quick-service formula.|$|E

25|$|In February 2010 Kmart {{requested}} {{permission from}} the NSW State Government to open their stores on Anzac Day prior to the traditional 1 pm time, claiming their <b>customers</b> <b>would</b> be severely inconvenienced by their closure.

25|$|Between 1944 and 2002, 1 Luxembourg franc {{was equal}} to 1 Belgian franc. Belgian francs were legal tender inside Luxembourg and Luxembourg francs were legal tender in Belgium.

25|$|Soon thereafter, in August 2014, President Maduro {{announced}} {{the creation of}} a new voluntary fingerprint scanning system that was allegedly aimed at combating food shortages and smuggling.

The effect of the nightly closings will be assessed after 30 days. Following large shortages in January 2015, Makro announced that some stores would begin using fingerprint systems and that <b>customers</b> <b>would</b> be rationed both daily and monthly.|$|E
25|$|Exactly how {{psychological}} pricing {{came into}} common use is not clear, {{though it is}} known the practice arose during the late 19th century. One source speculates it originated in a newspaper pricing competition. Melville E. Stone founded the Chicago Daily News in 1875, intending to price it at one cent {{to compete with the}} nickel papers of the day. The story claims that pennies were not common currency at the time, and so Stone colluded with advertisers to set whole dollar prices a cent lower—thus guaranteeing that <b>customers</b> <b>would</b> receive ample pennies in change.|$|E
50|$|There can be {{confusion}} between {{real estate}} settlement companies and mortgage originators. A <b>customer</b> <b>would</b> contact a bank (lender) for a mortgage, and would contact {{a real estate}} settlement company to handle {{the closing of the}} mortgage.|$|R

25|$|As {{far back}} as the 1970s, {{international}} fast food restaurant chain Burger King has attempted to introduce a premium line of burgers. These sandwiches are part of a system which eventually became known as the barbell strategy; a plan designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult-oriented fare along with products that are more value-oriented. This program is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be willing to spend more on the better quality products on one side while maintaining a lower cost value menu dedicated to a more cost-conscious audience on the other. The hope is that the <b>customers</b> <b>would</b> be drawn in initially for the lower prices of the value-menu and upgrade to the more expensive products, upping overall sales.|$|E
25|$|Nine Fokker F27s were bought, four from Trans Australia Airlines for $9.5 million.

Initially this included routes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu; Göteborg Landvetter Airport; Haugesund Airport, Karmøy; Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik; Jönköping Airport and Hamburg Airport. The services to Hamburg {{was by far the}} busiest, with five to seven daily services. The old aircraft, built between 1967 and 1969, were unpopular with the customers because of low comfort, high noise levels and many technical problems. <b>Customers</b> <b>would</b> often complain when they realized they would have to travel with a F27 rather than a DC-9.
