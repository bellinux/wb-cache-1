5|$|The site of S.iniae {{infection}} and its <b>clinical</b> <b>presentation</b> vary from species to species. In tilapia, S.iniae causes meningoencephalitis, with symptoms including lethargy, dorsal rigidity, and erratic swimming behavior; death follows {{in a matter}} of days. In rainbow trout, it is typically associated with septicemia and central nervous system damage. Symptoms are consistent with septicemia, and include lethargy and loss of orientation (as in tilapia), exophthalmia, corneal opacity, and external and internal bleeding.|$|E

5|$|A {{physician}} will initially assess for Parkinson's {{disease with}} a careful medical history and neurological examination. People {{may be given}} levodopa, with any resulting improvement in motor impairment helping to confirm the PD diagnosis. The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on autopsy is usually considered final proof that the person had PD. The clinical course of the illness over time may reveal it is not Parkinson's disease, requiring that the <b>clinical</b> <b>presentation</b> be periodically reviewed to confirm accuracy of the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|No {{significant}} difference appears in treatment success rates between linezolid, glycopeptides, or appropriate beta-lactam antibiotics {{in the treatment}} of pneumonia. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that linezolid be reserved for cases in which MRSA has been confirmed as the causative organism, or when MRSA infection is suspected based on the <b>clinical</b> <b>presentation.</b> The guidelines of the British Thoracic Society do not recommend it as first-line treatment, but rather as an alternative to vancomycin. Linezolid is also an acceptable second-line treatment for community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia when penicillin resistance is present.|$|E
5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on the <b>clinical</b> <b>presentation</b> of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Amebic liver abscess is a {{tropical}} disease {{with a wide}} spectrum of <b>clinical</b> <b>presentations.</b> Given the often nonspecific nature of the complaints related to amebic abscess, a retrospective review of patients with confirmed disease to recognize the most common patterns of presentation is useful. Here, we study the <b>clinical</b> <b>presentations</b> of 62 Thai patients with amebic liver abscess. We also compare the <b>clinical</b> <b>presentations</b> of Anti HIV seronegative and Anti HIV seropositive patients. Methods A retrospective case review was carried out for 62 Thai patients who had been diagnosed with amebic liver abscess. Clinical information was collected, including symptoms and signs, location and number of abscesses. The Anti HIV serology laboratory investigation was also reviewed. Results According to our study, the common clinical symptoms and signs are abdominal pain (85. 5 %), fever and chills (74. 2 %), and abdominal tenderness (69. 4 %). The location of the abscess was predominantly in the right lobe (74. 2 %), and most of patients had a single abscess (77. 4 %). Similar trends in <b>clinical</b> <b>presentations</b> were observed in both Anti HIV seropositive and Anti HIV seronegative subjects. Conclusions In conclusion, the <b>clinical</b> <b>presentations</b> of our amebic liver abscess patients were similar to those in previous reports. A similarity to those in the pyogenic liver abscess patients can be observed. Nevertheless, we could not detect important significant differences in the <b>clinical</b> <b>presentations</b> between Anti HIV seropositive and Anti HIV seronegative groups of patients. </p...|$|R

Primary bacteraemia, infection without identifiable focal origin, comprises approximately 20% of the reported cases.|$|E
