40|$|The {{radiation}} resistance of ITO/InP cells processed by DC magnetron sputtering {{is compared to}} that of standard n/p InP and GaAs homojunction cells.

DNA origami, a molecular self-assembly technique, has promise to programmatically self-assemble nanoparticles (NPs) with nanometer precision. The work presented here demonstrates the programmatic self-assembly of AuNPs on DNA origami nanotubes (NTs). DNA origami NTs were also functionalized with positively charged Au clusters. DNA origami NTs, both bare and functionalized with Au, were electrically characterized using DC current-voltage (DC-IV) measurements. The measurements showed that bare, undecorated DNA NTs behaved as an insulator, whereas linear, ohmic conductivity was observed for Au enhanced Au decorated NTs. Resistances varied between 60 Ω to 8 MΩ after 15 minutes of electroless Au deposition. After SEM imaging, a decrease in resistances was recorded for several Au enhanced AuNP DNA NTs with final resistances ranging from ~ 48 Ω to ~ 170 Ω. DNA origami NTs were also conductive with linear, ohmic behavior and resistances in the MΩ range after 9 minutes of Au enhancement.

30|$|It {{is known}} that Cu can be {{electrochemically}} deposited on n-type semiconductor[12]. Therefore, it was supposed that inversion of <b>conductivity</b> <b>type</b> takes place, and 'hills' of the periodic structures are of n-type. Possibility to invert <b>conductivity</b> <b>type</b> by laser radiation was shown in several p- and n-type semiconductors: p-Si[13 – 15], p-CdTe[16], p-InSb[17, 18], p-InAs[19], p-PbSe[20], p-Ge[21], and n-HgCdTe[22]. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the nature of inversion of <b>conductivity</b> <b>type,</b> for example, impurities' segregation, defects' generation[20], amorphization[23] and oxygen-related donor generation[14]. However, there are many contradictions in the mechanisms. For example, n-type impurities in Si irradiated by laser cannot be oxygen atoms, according to paper[15]. Several authors have tried to explain p-n junction formation in n-type HgCdTe by defects’ generation, based on a model of defect formation related to interstitial mercury diffusion[24].
