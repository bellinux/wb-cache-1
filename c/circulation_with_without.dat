40|$|The Indian subcontinent {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{intensely}} irrigated regions of the world and state of the art climate models do not account for the representation of irrigation. Sensitivity studies with the regional climate model REMO show distinct feedbacks between the simulation of the monsoon <b>circulation</b> <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> irrigation processes. We find that the temperature and mean sea level pressure, where the standard REMO version without irrigation shows a significant bias over the areas of Indus basin, is highly sensitive to the water used for irrigation. In our sensitivity test we find that removal of this bias has causedness differential heating between land and sea masses. This in turns reduces the westerlies entering into land from Arabian Sea, hence creating conditions favorable for currents from Bay of Bengal to intrude deep into western India and Pakistan that have been unrealistically suppressed before. We conclude that the representation of irrigated water is unavoidable for realistic simulation of south Asian summer monsoon and its response under global warming...|$|R
40|$|Background To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} collateral coronary circulation {{on the outcome of}} the patients with anterior myocardial infarction (MI) with left anterior desending artery occlusion abruptly. Methods Data of 189 patients with acute anterior MI who had a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the first 12 h from the onset of symptoms between January 2004 and December 2008 were retrospective analyzed. Left anterior descending arteries (LAD) of all patients were occluded. LADs were reopened with primary PCI. According to the collateral circulation, all patients were classified to two groups: no collateral group (n = 111), patients without angiographic collateral filling of LAD or side branches (collateral index 0) and collateral group (n = 78), and patients with angiographic collateral filling of LAD or side branches (collateral index 1, 2 or 3). At one year’s follow-up, the occurrence of death, reinfarction, stent thrombosis (ST), target vessel revascularization and readmission because of heart failure were observed. Results At one year, the mortality was lower in patients <b>with</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> compared <b>with</b> those <b>without</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> (1 % vs. 8 %, P = 0. 049), whereas there were no differences in the occurrence of reinfarction, ST, target vessel revascularization and readmission because of heart failure. The occurrence of composite of endpoint was lower in patients <b>with</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> compared <b>with</b> those <b>without</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> (12 % vs. 26 %; P = 0. 014).

40|$|The current article {{presents}} a novel physiological control algorithm for ventricular assist devices (VADs), which {{is inspired by}} the preload recruitable stroke work. This controller adapts the hydraulic power output of the VAD to the end-diastolic volume of the left ventricle. We tested this controller on a hybrid mock circulation where the left ventricular volume (LVV) is known, i. e., the problem of measuring the LVV is not addressed in the current article. Experiments were conducted to compare {{the response of the}} controller with the physiological and <b>with</b> the pathological <b>circulation,</b> <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> VAD support. A sensitivity analysis was performed to analyze the influence of the controller parameters and the influence {{of the quality of the}} LVV signal on the performance of the control algorithm. The results show that the controller induces a response similar to the physiological circulation and effectively prevents over- and underpumping, i. e., ventricular suction and backflow from the aorta to the left ventricle, respectively. The same results are obtained in the case of a disturbed LVV signal.

40|$|Foetal {{cardiac output}} is high, {{and the heart}} has not {{been shown to have}} the {{sustained}} reserves demonstrated in the adult heart. About 40 % (~ 200 ml. kg body weight" 1. min" 1) of the combined output of both ventricles (CVO) in unanaesthetized foetal lambs in late gestation is directed to the umbilical circulation. At least one-half of the systemic flow (~ 300 ml. kg body weight" 1. min" 1) goes to skin and carcass. About 50 % of the remainder (10 % CVO) is shared by brain, heart and kidney and the rest by other viscera; less than 6 % CVO perfuses the lungs. Hypoxaemia. acidaemia and various vasomotor agents influence the partition of cardiac output between systemic and umbilical <b>circulations,</b> <b>with</b> or <b>without</b> rela-tively small changes of blood pressure, which is low by adult standards. In general, the conductance of systemic circuits is more susceptible to change than that of the umbilical. Both cerebral and myocardial blood flow increase several-fold during hypoxaemia. The additional volume flow of blood de-manded by such vasodilatation in organs forming a relatively small propor-tion of body weight is more than accounted for by concurrent vasoconstriction in muscle (which contributes a substantial fraction of body weight) and other tissues.

In a letter to Murray, March 6, 1816, he says that he [...] "disowns" [...] 'The Curse, etc.', [...] "as stolen and published in a miserable and villainous copy in the magazine." [...] The reference is to 'The Malediction of Minerva, or The Athenian Marble-Market', which appeared in the 'New Monthly Magazine' for April, 1818, vol. iii. 240. It numbers 111 lines, and is signed [...] "Steropes" [...] (The Lightner, a Cyclops). The text of the magazine, with the same additional footnotes, but under the title of 'The Curse', etc., was republished in the eighth edition of 'Poems on His Domestic Circumstances', W.

Whatever may have been his feelings or intentions in 1812, four years later Byron was well aware that 'The Curse of Minerva' would not increase his reputation as a poet, while the object of his satire--the exposure and denunciation of Lord Elgin--had been accomplished by the scathing stanzas (canto ii. 10-15), with their accompanying note, in 'Childe Harold'.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of {{inhibition}} of nitric oxide (NO) (endothelium-derived relaxation factor) synthase in combination with alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockade on pulmonary vascular tone during exercise. In paired studies, we exercised sheep on a treadmill at a speed of 4 mph, and measured blood flow and pressures across the pulmonary <b>circulation</b> <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> inhibition of NO synthase (N omega-nitro-L-arginine 20 mg/kg intravenous [i. v. ]), alpha receptor blockade (phentolamine 5 mg i. v.), beta receptor blockade (propranolol 1 mg i. v.), and combined alpha and beta receptor blockade. Activation of both types of adrenergic receptors occurs with exercise, and because increased release in NO is hypothesized to occur during exercise, these studies were designed to determine the magnitude of effect and interactions of these competing dilator and constrictor influences. We found that inhibition of NO synthase raised pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) at rest and that, although a reduction in PVR occurred with exercise from this new baseline, vasoconstriction persisted. Combined beta blockade and NO synthase inhibition unmasked unopposed alpha vasoconstriction; PVR rose at rest and continued to rise with exercise; and mean pulmonary arterial pressures approached very high levels, 43. 8 +/- 4. 4 cmH 2 O. Using a distal wedged pulmonary artery catheter technique, most of the vasoconstriction {{was found to be}} in vessels upstream from small pulmonary veins. During exercise in sheep {{there appears to be a}} high degree of alpha and beta adrenergic-mediated tone in the pulmonary circulation.

The sonochemically active region was pictured using sonochemiluminescence imaging and the flow fields were visualised with dyed flow videos. At 376 and 995 kHz, an increase in sonochemical activity was observed with the slower flow rate; however at 1179 kHz, the sonochemical activity was either not affected or decreased. The observed changes in sonochemical activity were attributed to an increase in asymmetry of the bubble collapse brought about by fluid motion. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesOur {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} feasibility and early to medium-term outcome of stenting the patent ductus arteriosus at the time of radiofrequency valvotomy in the subgroup of patients with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and intermediate right ventricle. BackgroundStenting of the patent ductus arteriosus and radiofrequency valvotomy have been proposed as the initial intervention for patients with intermediate right ventricle inasmuch as the sustainability for biventricular circulation or 1 ½-ventricle repair is unclear in the early period. MethodsBetween January 2001 and April 2009, of 143 patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum, 37 who had bipartite right ventricle underwent radiofrequency valvotomy and stenting of the patent ductus arteriosus as the initial procedure. The mean tricuspid valve z-score was − 3. 8 ± 2. 2 and the mean tricuspid valve/mitral valve ratio was 0. 62 ± 0. 16. ResultsMedian age was 10 days (3 – 65 days) and median weight 3. 1 kg (2. 4 – 4. 9 kg). There was no procedural mortality. Acute stent thrombosis developed in 1 patient and necessitated emergency systemic–pulmonary shunt. There were 2 early in-hospital deaths owing to low cardiac output syndrome. One late death occurred owing to right ventricular failure after the operation. Survival after the initial procedure was 94 % at 6 months and 91 % at 5 years. At a median follow-up of 4 years (6 months to 8 years), 17 (48 %) attained biventricular <b>circulation</b> <b>with</b> or <b>without</b> other interventions and 9 (26 %) achieved 1 ½-ventricle repair. The freedom from reintervention was 80 %, 68 %, 58 %, and 40 % at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. ConclusionsConcomitant stenting of the patent ductus arteriosus at the time of radiofrequency valvotomy in patients with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and intermediate right ventricle is feasible and safe with encouraging medium-term outcome...|$|R

Coating of {{extracorporeal circulation}} tubes as well as avoidance of shed blood recirculation {{have been shown to}} reduce these phenomena. We evaluated a new shed blood separation system (AVANT D 970) utilizing a coated cardiopulmonary bypass tube system (PHISIO). MethodsForty patients (62 ± 10 years) underwent isolated coronary revascularization. Four groups (n = 10 /group) were defined: no extracorporeal circulation, conventional uncoated extracorporeal circulation, uncoated extracorporeal <b>circulation</b> <b>with</b> shed blood separation, and coated extracorporeal <b>circulation</b> <b>with</b> shed blood separation. Thrombin-antithrombin complex and free Hb were analyzed and statistically compared. ResultsConventional extracorporeal circulation exhibited the highest intraoperative activation of coagulation (thrombin-antithrombin complex: extracorporeal circulation, 31. 1 ± 15. 8 μg/L; uncoated extracorporeal <b>circulation</b> <b>with</b> shed blood separation, 15. 3 ± 7. 8 μg/L; coated extracorporeal <b>circulation</b> <b>with</b> shed blood separation, 8. 1 ± 4. 8 μg/L; no extracorporeal circulation, 2. 4 ± 0. 6 μg/L; P <. 05 extracorporeal circulation vs all others) and red blood cell damage (free Hb: extracorporeal circulation, 16. 8 ± 11. 4 μmol/L; uncoated extracorporeal <b>circulation</b> <b>with</b> shed blood separation, 10. 3 ± 3. 5 μmol/L; coated extracorporeal <b>circulation</b> <b>with</b> shed blood separation, 6. 8 ± 2. 9 μmol/L; no extracorporeal circulation, 3. 4 ± 1. 1 μmol/L; P <. 05 extracorporeal circulation vs no extracorporeal circulation, coated extracorporeal <b>circulation</b> <b>with</b> shed blood separation). Coated extracorporeal <b>circulation</b> <b>with</b> shed blood separation showed only slight activation and cell trauma, which did not differ significantly from no extracorporeal circulation. ConclusionsCombination of coating and avoidance of shed blood recirculation maintained physiological coagulation levels and markedly reduced red blood cell trauma in extracorporeal circulation procedures.

We agree with the authors of the commentary that the idea of thrombectomy {{with the use of a}} balloon catheter has been previously introduced [2]. How-ever, in their method Yanaga et al. used 12 F aortic balloon catheter to perform atrial thrombectomy, whereas we used 22 F Foley catheter to retrieve a thrombus. Furthermore, unlike the called method of atrial tumor thrombus (TT) removal, our tech-nique abrogates the need for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), reducing therefore the risks associat-ed <b>with</b> extracorporeal <b>circulation</b> <b>with</b> or <b>without</b> hypothermic circulatory arrest such as increased operative time, cardiorespiratory complications, postoperative bleeding, coagulopathies and perma-nent neurological dysfunction such as hallucina-tions or stroke. We agree with the authors of the commentary that the total mean intraoperative blood loss of 3, 150 ml observed in our case series is substan-tial [3]. It was attributed to collateral veins around the kidney and occurred predominantly before ca-votomy and tumor thrombus retrieval. Our data on the mean blood loss are indeed comparable or better than the blood loss and transfusion re-quirements reported in other studies, which ana-lysed surgical outcomes after conventional or minimally invasive interventions for level IV TT [2, 4, 5]. This, however, should not be compared with the results presented in two papers called by authors of the commentary for the three main rea-sons [6, 7]. Firstly, our technique of thrombectomy is dedicated to treat the level IV TT i. e. thrombus extending into the right atrium, and consequently reports on the mean blood loss occurring during the level IV TT removal. Whereas, the reported median blood loss of 1, 300 ml in the paper by Kaag et al. refers to the data obtained from 78 patients who underwent radical nephrectomy with throm-bectomy for TT of level I-IV (with only 3 case...|$|R

40|$|The {{strength}} of the Brewer–Dobson circulation is difficult to estimate using observations. Trends {{in the age of}} stratospheric air, deduced from observations of transient tracers, have been used to identify trends in the circulation, but there are ambiguities in the relationship between age and the {{strength of}} the circulation. This paper presents a steady-state theory and a time-dependent extension to relate age of air directly to the diabatic circulation of the stratosphere. In steady state, it is the difference between the age of upwelling and downwelling air through an isentrope and not the absolute value of age that {{is a measure of the}} {{strength of the}} diabatic circulation through that isentrope. For the time-varying case, expressions for other terms that contribute to the age budget are derived. An idealized atmospheric general <b>circulation</b> model <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> a seasonal cycle is used to test the time-dependent theory and to find that these additional terms are small upon annual averaging. The steady-state theory holds as well for annual averages of a seasonally varying model as for a perpetual-solstice model.

40|$|International audienceThe Pic 2005 field {{campaign}} {{took place}} from 13 June to 7 July 2005 {{close to the}} high-altitude permanent atmospheric observatory Pic-du-Midi (PDM), situated at 2875 m asl in the French Pyrenees. The experimental set-up combined in situ ground-based observations at PDM with ozone lidar measurements at two lower sites in close vicinity (600 m asl/ 28 km away, and 2380 m asl/ 500 m away). Such an experimental configuration is appropriate {{to address the question}} of the vertical layering of the chemical atmosphere in a mountain area and above the plain nearby, and how this influences measurements conducted on a mountain summit under the influence of horizontal transport at regional scale, and vertical transport at local scale. Forecast tools made it possible to plan and carry out 6 one-day Intensive Observation Periods (IOPs), mostly in anticyclonic conditions favoring local thermally induced <b>circulations,</b> <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> local pollution in the lower troposphere. It was thus possible to document i) ozone diurnal variations at PDM; ii) correlation between ozone measurements at PDM and their counterparts at the same altitude in the free troposphere; iii) ozone variability in the vicinity of PDM. The field campaign provided direct experimental evidence that at daytime in the encountered conditions (mostly anticyclonic), PDM failed in a large extent to be representative of the troposphere above the surrounding flat areas at similar altitude. First, ozone daily averages at PDM were found lower than their free-tropospheric counterpart. Thermally induced circulations and convection pumping clean air from the rural boundary layer can account qualitatively for ozone depletion observed at PDM during daytime. However the surface measurements do not support the hypothesis of direct lifting of near-surface air masses up to PDM. Thus, mixing with free-tropospheric air, photochemistry and surface deposition in the valleys appear to be needed ingredients to account quantitatively for the observed variations (in proportions that further studies should determine). Second, ozone variability was found to be much lower at PDM than in the free troposphere [...] again an indication of atmospheric mixing. In particular at daytime, the PDM observatory did not allow for detection of ozone-rich layers simultaneously visible above the plain. Beyond these first results, the data set presented here paves way to detailed studies of the IOPs...|$|R

40|$|It is {{debated whether}} the {{response}} of the tropical Pacific Ocean to the 11 -yr solar cycle forcing resembles a La Niña – or El Niño–like signal. To address this issue, ensemble simulations employing an atmospheric general <b>circulation</b> model <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> ocean coupling are conducted. The coupled simulations show no evidence for a LaNiña–like cooling in solarmaxima. Instead, the tropical sea surface temperature rises almost in phase with the 11 -yr solar cycle. A basinwide warming of about 0. 1 K is simulated in the tropical Pacific, whereas thewarming in the tropical Indian andAtlanticOceans is weaker. In thewestern Pacific, the region of deep convection shifts to the east, thus reducing the surface easterlies. This shift is independent of the ocean coupling because deep convection moves to the east in the uncoupled simulations too. The reduced surface easterlies cool the subsurface but warm the surface due to the reduction of heat transport divergence. The latter mechanism operates together with water vapor feedback, resulting in a stronger tropical Pacific warming relative to the warming over the tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans. These results suggest that the atmospheric response to the 11 -yr solar cycle drives the tropical Pacific response, which is amplified by atmosphere–ocean feedbacks operating on decadal time scales. Based on the coupled simulations, it is con-cluded that the tropical Pacific Ocean should warm when the sun is more active. 1...|$|R
