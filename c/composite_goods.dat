40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{tests of}} the theoretical validity of the contingent valuation (CV) method. The validity of CV is especially a concern when involving environmental goods with a predominant non-use value. One test of theoretical validity is the adding-up property that implies that a specific good should be equally valued irrespectively of it is being valued directly or built-up sequentially. In this CV study four independent sub-samples stated willingness {{to pay for the}} same <b>composite</b> <b>good,</b> or package, using different sequences. One sub-sample valued the <b>composite</b> <b>good</b> directly, while two sub-samples faced built-up sequences valuing first subsets of this <b>composite</b> <b>good.</b> A fourth sub-sample valued the <b>composite</b> <b>good</b> from a dividing-out approach, facing first the valuation of a larger multi-package. Theoretically expected sequencing effects were observed; the subset goods obtained higher values earlier in a sequence, and the dividing-out approach decreased the stated value for the <b>composite</b> <b>good.</b> Most importantly, these CV data did pass the {{tests of the}} adding-up property.

30|$|Consider {{now that}} the <b>composite</b> <b>good</b> is formed by three {{components:}} A, B and C. In an industry with two producers for each component we will have six independent firms. Three different mergers are analyzed: a H merger, a V merger with the three components of the <b>composite</b> <b>good</b> and another V merger with only two components of the <b>composite</b> <b>good.</b> All of them are always preferred compared to the initial situation of all independent firms. However, we will initially focus on {{the second type of}} V merger to be more consistent with the initial setting where only mergers of two firms are considered. Notice that as before, a H merger implies fully monopolization of one component but the adding of one more component to the <b>composite</b> <b>good</b> implies lower margins for the merged firm and also for the outsiders; while a V merger is a less powerful tool to control the <b>composite</b> <b>good</b> market, since now there is no full control of a <b>composite</b> <b>good.</b> As a consequence V mergers become a less attractive option so that only the H merger arises at equilibrium. Regarding SW and CS, similar patterns as in the model with two components arise, but now both ranges in which the vertical merger is optimal for the society are slightly more demanding, more differentiation in the <b>composite</b> <b>good</b> is needed in order to clear a V merger. In case the V merger involved the control of the whole bundle then the V merger option arises at equilibrium for a larger range in the differentiation ratio as compared to the standard model. This is an expected result since a merger of three firms is more profitable than one of two.|$|R
3000|$|Consider the {{following}} {{extension of the}} model by assuming two qualities, for instance component A_ 1 ^+ will have a higher quality modeled as a higher willingness to pay in the utility function. The coefficient of the linear term in the utility function for all <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> including [...] A_ 1 ^+ is now α +τ (where τ is positive) while for {{those that do not}} include it is α [...]. The effect of one component of higher quality is to enhance demand for all <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> including the higher quality component and shift inwards the demand of those not including it. Equilibrium component prices of <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> including A_ 1 ^+ increase with respect to the symmetric situation since those <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> benefit from the increase in quality of one of its components, while the price of component of A_ 2 is reduced. Similarly, profits for all firms increase except for the firm producing component A_ 2.|$|E
30|$|As {{noted above}} n^ 2 <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> can be {{assembled}} when components are fully compatible. No compatibility imposes restrictions among the combinations consumers can make. Firms usually establish such restrictions based on technical or physical elements. If {{this is the}} case, we will assume that, for example, only components with the same subscript can be assembled leading to a market with only n <b>composite</b> <b>goods.</b> When n= 2, the no compatibility case reduces the number of <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> by two. Each firm reacts by increasing its component price since it is not now internalizing competition among the <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> that use its component leading to less demand per component, although the <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> remaining in the market are sold more. Since {{the increase in the}} output per composite good does not compensate for the {{reduction in the number of}} them, consumers are worse off if the market turns to be of not compatible components. Social welfare is also reduced, but for firms no compatibility pays off when <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> are not very differentiated, i.e. for γ/β> 0.623. Regarding the equilibrium merger, it is firstly checked that a H merger is always leading to larger profits for participants, however, a V merger does not in any case. That is, V mergers are not yielding enough profits when the differentiation ratio is large, in particular for γ/β> 0.604, the increase in demand the merged entity receives induced by the reduction in the bundle price is not compensating initial profits. There are not now mix-and-match <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> that push profits upwards. Finally, the V merger will arise at equilibrium when <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> are sufficiently differentiated, that is for γ/β< 0.261, the H merger otherwise. Thus, no compatibility reduces the number of <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> in the market which implies a reduction in profits for the H merger, while the V merger decrease in profits is lower or even it is turned an increase in profits if γ/β> 0.665. Then, it can be concluded that the Cournot effect is more intense than the competition effect in a market with few <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> per firm. 22 Outsiders are in any case worse off after either merger. Finally and regarding welfare, the conclusions follow the same patterns as in the compatibility case, only V mergers might be cleared. The effect of no compatibility is to increase the range of the clearance for the V merger under both welfare standards. That is, a V merger is always cleared under the CS standard and it is cleared if γ/β< 0.984 under the SW standard. Then our policy implications apply to the no compatibility case, all proposed H merger has to be blocked, while all proposed V should be cleared.|$|E
40|$|This {{industry}} is formed by single-component producers whose components are combined to create <b>composite</b> <b>goods.</b> When a given firm has {{the possibility of}} merging with either a complement or a substitute good producer, its equilibrium choice depends {{on the degree of}} product differentiation in the composite good market. A merger between complements, which allows for mixed bundling, only happens when <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> are very differentiated. Private incentives do not always go along with social interests and the equilibrium merger can differ from the socially optimal merger.

30|$|Coming back {{to policy}} implications, notice that {{horizontal}} mergers are commonly proposed and usually accepted {{in case there}} is no substantial lessening of competition or the merger is a necessary condition to achieve efficiency gains. Since the isolated strategic effects do not allow to clear horizontal mergers, we resort to considering efficiency effects linked to horizontal mergers to check the conditions antitrust authorities should impose to clear them for the case of n= 2. To tackle this issue we consider a price index to evaluate unilateral effects of a merger which takes into account, on the one hand, the diversion ratio and the pre-merger margin index and, on the other, the pass-through rate. We find that both the diversion ratio and the pre-merger margin index are greater in a <b>composite</b> <b>good</b> industry, compared to a regular good industry. Thus, despite being counter intuitive, firms’ market power is greater in a four-firm <b>composite</b> <b>good</b> industry than in a standard duopoly of a regular good. The pass-through rate, however, is lower in a <b>composite</b> <b>good</b> industry. An important {{result is that the}} marginal cost saving required for a horizontal merger in order not to increase prices is greater in a <b>composite</b> <b>good</b> industry than in a regular good one. Antitrust authorities should request, therefore, higher savings levels in the case of horizontal mergers in <b>composite</b> <b>good</b> markets.|$|R
25|$|The {{concept of}} the <b>composite</b> <b>good</b> {{addresses}} this problem. The addition of a <b>composite</b> <b>good</b> in a single-good model (bringing it up to two) allows for all other opportunities to be accounted for. Since the composite is considered a single good only for purposes of the model, analysis can be made on a two-dimensional graph. Optimal choices represent the bundle of two goods; the first <b>good</b> and the <b>composite.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{calculating the}} {{opportunity}} {{cost of a}} policy, a standard unit of account allows {{for the creation of}} a <b>composite</b> <b>good.</b> A <b>composite</b> <b>good</b> is a theoretical abstraction that represents an aggregation of all other opportunities that are not realized by the first good. It allows an economic decision's benefits to be weighed against the costs of all other possible goods in that society, without having to refer to any directly. Often, this is most easily accomplished with money.|$|R
3000|$|Consider now {{a merger}} between two {{producers}} of different components: e.g. the A_ 1 B_ 1 merger. The new entity {{is able to}} implement a mixed bundling pricing strategy, that is, it selects three prices p_ 1,q_ 1 and the bundle price s_b, where at equilibrium, [...] s_b<p_ 1 +q_ 1 =s_ 11. The demand system must then be reformulated substituting s_ 11 for s_b, as now composite good A_ 1 B_ 1 is only demanded as a bundle, since it offers a discount on price. 17 This implies that the merger now gets revenues from directly selling one composite good (i.e. the bundle X_ 11) and from the selling of two components which are combined by consumers to form 2 (n- 1) mix-and-match <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> (i.e. X_ 1 j for j 1 and X_i 1 for i 1). The remaining [...] (n- 1)× (n- 1) <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> are totally controlled by outsiders. The new entity and outsiders maximize profits by choosing prices. The equilibrium prices {{are listed in the}} Appendix and can be ranked as follows: [...] p_M^V(n)>p^I(n)>p_O^V(n), for the component prices and [...] s_MO^V(n)>s^I(n)>s_O^V(n)>s_b^V(n), for the composite good prices. Superscript V denotes Vertical, while subscripts O, MO and b are denoting outsiders, mix-and-match <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> and the bundle, respectively. Notice, that both types of outsiders price their components at the same level, p_O^V(n), since they face identical strategic conditions. The effect of a vertical merger is then an increase in the component prices produced by the merger and a reduction in components produced by outsiders as compared to the initial situation. Focusing on composite good prices, mix-and-match <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> are sold at a higher price than <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> before the merger (i.e. s_MO^V(n)>s^I(n)), while <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> assembled using outsider components are priced lower, s^I(n)>s_O^V(n). Finally, the bundle reaches the lowest price. As it might occur in a H merger, we find that some <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> increase their price while others do not after a merger. Thus, the general presumption that mergers between complements lead to lower prices is not completely true. This happens because the merger increases its single component prices to benefit its bundle demand, in detriment of mix-and-match <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> demands. The effects on prices of a merger are smoothed as the number of firms increase. Notice that,in contrast with the Horizontal merger case, the consideration of more than two firms per component is not implying a qualitative change.|$|E

3000|$|In Choi (2008) only {{vertical}} mergers are considered, however, when firms {{also have}} the option to create a horizontal merger and the number of firms producing components is not too large, vertical mergers only arise for low values of the γ/β ratio, while a [...] H [...] merger is privately preferred otherwise. If γ/β is close to zero <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> are very differentiated and competition is not intense, thus the merged firm prefers to fully control one composite good through a vertical merger. In this way the new entity benefits from the so-called Cournot effect, the price reduction for two complements when they are sold by the same firm rather than by separate monopolists. The merger leads to a reduction in both complement prices, since the new firm captures the demand increase in the composite good when it lowers the other component’s price. As γ/β increases, <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> are less differentiated and competition is more intense. Prices are already rather low, so a merger between complements makes prices decrease even more, and this makes the vertical merger less profitable. Then, it is preferable to internalize the effects of competition within substitutes, the competition effect, by partially monopolizing one component type. In this way, the merger controls one component in 2 n <b>composite</b> <b>goods,</b> increasing its market power. The above argument works out even for the case where the [...] V [...] merger implies pure bundling. Then, [...] H [...] mergers are more suitable tools rather than [...] V [...] ones to increase business profits when the number of firms is lower than 22. The Cournot effect is dominated by the competition effect. 20 Considering <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> changes the intuition we have about the effects in the market of increasing the number of competitors. One more component producer is not only increasing competition in the market but also allowing existing firms to sell more <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> that were not previously available. As a consequence, if <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> are very much differentiated, the increase in demand may offset the increase in competition so firms get more profits with more firms in the market. The Cournot effect is capitalizing this effect as it is larger than the competition effect when <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> are very differentiated. When, given n, competition becomes tougher because <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> are more substitutable, the competition effect is less affected by the increase in competition. However, as the number of firms increase, the gain derived from a H [...] merger is decreasing more quickly than the gain derived from a [...] V [...] one.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the incentive to}} integrate vertically in a simple 2 X 2 Bertrand model of two substitutes that are each comprised of two complementary components. We confirm that all prices fall {{as a result of}} a vertical merger. Further, we find that, when the <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> are poor substitutes, producers of complementary components are better off after integration. Thus at equilibrium, each pair of complementary goods is produced by a single firm (parallel vertical integration). In contrast, when the <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> are close substitutes, vertical integration reduces profits of the merging firms and is therefore undesirable. Thus, at equilibrium, all firms are independent (independent ownership). The reason for the change in the incentive to merge is that, as the <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> become closer substitutes, competition between them reduces prices (in comparison to full monopoly) thereby eliminating the usefulness of a vertical merger in accomplishing the same price effect. We also find that, for intermediate levels of substitution, firms producing complementary components prefer to merge only if the substitute good is produced by an integrated firm. Thus, for intermediate levels of substitution, both parallel vertical integration and independent ownership are equilibria. ...|$|E
3000|$|To {{answer the}} above questions, we {{will present a}} model that allows firms to choose the type of merger. Then, {{consider}} an industry of <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> formed by two components, A and B. There are [...] n [...] independent firms producing varieties of component A and n firms producing varieties of its complementary component B. Components’ compatibility results in n× n <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> in the market. We assume consumers choose components {{to create their own}} <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> and get utility, since consuming separate components is useless. Therefore, <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> compete as imperfect substitutes, {{but at the same time}} different type components are complements while same type components are also substitutes. The proponent firm chooses between merging with a substitute component producer, with a complementary component producer or remaining alone. Focusing on strategic effects, we find that a vertical merger is privately preferred only when <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> are very differentiated or when the number of firms is greater than 11, the horizontal merger is chosen otherwise. 8 Therefore horizontal mergers are more suitable tools rather than vertical ones to increase business profits when products are less differentiated and the number of <b>composite</b> <b>goods</b> available in the market is not very large, i.e. greater than 121. The Cournot effect derived from a vertical merger, that is the price reduction for two complements when they are sold by the same firm rather than by separate monopolists, is dominated by the competition effect resulting from a horizontal merger, that is the acquisition of greater market power derived from the internalization of competition within substitutes through the partial monopolization of one component. Two interesting policy implications are reached: (i) when only strategic effects are reckoned, proposed vertical mergers have to be always cleared while proposed horizontal mergers must be always blocked by antitrust authorities. And (ii) merger proposals different from the equilibrium ones are sufficient conditions for antitrust agencies to infer substantial efficiencies not considered that justify those proposals. Focusing on the case of n= 2, the above results and policy implications are most of the times qualitatively robust to the consideration of alternative assumptions such as different number of producers for each component, three components instead of two, not compatible components and differences in quality among firms producing the same component. Several asymmetries arise between firms in industries with such alternative assumptions, what makes the equilibrium merger be sensitive to the identity of the proposer. However, the socially optimal merger maintains basically the same pattern with some variations in the ranges for the differentiation ratio required to clear vertical mergers.|$|E
