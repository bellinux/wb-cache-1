25|$|To {{calculate}} the kinetics of gait patterns, most labs have floor-mounted load transducers, {{also known as}} force platforms, which measure the ground reaction forces and moments, including the magnitude, direction and location (called the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure).</b> The spatial distribution of forces can be measured with pedobarography equipment. Adding this to the known dynamics of each body segment enables the solution of equations based on the Newton–Euler equations of motion permitting computations of the net forces and the net moments of force about each joint at every stage of the gait cycle. The computational method for {{this is known as}} inverse dynamics.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of published results of force tests on 80 cone-cylinder-flare configurations at Mach numbers of 2. 18, 2. 81, and 4. 04. The contributions, excluding interference effects, of the cone-cylinder bodies to the over-all normal force derivatives {{have been removed}} {{by means of the}} second-order shock-expansion method, and the normal force derivatives at zero angle of attack due to the flares alone are shown. The results {{from a wide variety of}} configurations are correlated by plotting ratios of the normal force derivatives of the flares to the normal force derivatives of cones having the same included angle. Comparisons are made of the experimental normal force results with the normal force derivatives obtained by assuming conical flow over the flares and with those obtained by use of the second-order shock-expansion method. The comparisons show that use of the second-order shock-expansion method is generally the superior of the two, and in most cases gives values of the normal force derivatives of the flares which agree very well with the experimental results. <b>Centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> the flares are presented and comparisons are made with results obtained from the theories mentioned. In general, the comparisons show that the assumption of conical flow over the flares is comparable to use of the second-order shock-expansion method in determining the <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure,</b> and in many cases both methods give values which agree closely with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The {{trajectory}} of the human body's <b>center</b> <b>of</b> gravity (CG) during motion is usually determined from measurements of whole-body kinematics. Yet another method for estimating the CG trajectory is based on force-plate data of reactive forces and <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> and on applying the equations of motion. However, using this latter method requires additional information on {{the rate of change}} of the angular momentum () of the body about its CG. In this study we present a model for the estimation of the CG trajectory during standing sway, based on the reactive forces and <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressures</b> as measured bilaterally, i. e. from two force platforms. An iterative algorithm was developed to evaluate and accordingly correct the estimated CG trajectory. A three-dimensional, four-joint, five-segment model of the human body was used to describe postural standing sway dynamics. In the first iteration, the kinematics of the segments was calculated from the CG trajectory obtained for = 0. From the second iteration, the estimated values of were used to update the CG trajectory. The above method is illustrated on a group of 11 able-bodied subjects and the results obtained indicate that the CG trajectory is negligibly affected by the contribution. The method is further implemented on two subjects with musculo-skeletal pathologies to illustrate the model behavior and resulting CG trajectory in cases where asymmetry during standing can be expected. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|Johnson {{said in his}} {{autobiography}} that he pleaded with NACA to do model tests in its wind tunnel. They already had experience of models thrashing around violently at speeds approaching those requested {{and did not want}} to risk damaging their tunnel. Gen. Arnold, head of Army Air Forces, ordered them to run the tests, which were done up to Mach 0.74. The P-38's dive problem was revealed to be the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> moving back toward the tail when in high-speed airflow. The solution was to change the geometry of the wing's lower surface when diving in order to keep lift within bounds of the top of the wing. In February 1943, quick-acting dive flaps were tried and proven by Lockheed test pilots. The dive flaps were installed outboard of the engine nacelles, and in action they extended downward 35° in 1.5 seconds. The flaps did not act as a speed brake; they affected the pressure distribution in a way that retained the wing's lift.|$|E
500|$|It was {{discovered}} that the craft was inherently unstable in forward flight, as the aerodynamic <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> was well forward {{of the center of}} gravity. The Avrocar thus included a mechanical stability control system that was independent of the pilot's controls. The turborotor had a fairly large angular momentum and was intended to act as a powerful gyroscope, providing a [...] "normal" [...] direction of flight. Control cables attached {{to the base of the}} rotor would be pulled when the craft moved in relation to the rotor, actuating the control surfaces to counteract the motion.|$|E
500|$|North American {{improved}} on {{the basic}} concept by adding a set of drooping wing tip panels that were lowered at high speed. This helped trap the shock wave under the wing between the downturned wing tips. It also added more vertical surface to the aircraft to maintain directional stability at high speeds. NAA's solution had an additional advantage, as it decreased the surface area of {{the rear of the}} wing when the panels were moved into their high-speed position. This helped offset the natural rearward shift of the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure,</b> or [...] "average lift point", with increasing speeds. Under normal conditions this caused an increasing nose-down trim, which had to be offset by moving the control surfaces, increasing drag. When the wing tips were drooped, the surface area {{at the rear of the}} wings was lessened, moving the lift forward and reducing trim drag.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the absence}} of rotation, the wind tends to blow from areas <b>of</b> high <b>pressure</b> to areas <b>of</b> low <b>pressure.</b> [...] The {{stronger}} the pressure difference (pressure gradient) between a high-pressure system and a low-pressure system, the stronger the wind. The coriolis force caused by Earth's rotation gives winds within high-pressure systems their clockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected right from the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> high <b>pressure)</b> and anticlockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected left from the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> high <b>pressure).</b> Friction with land slows down the wind flowing out of high-pressure systems and causes wind to flow more outward (more ageostrophically) from the center.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{the rotary}} {{derivatives}} of the X- 15 aircraft {{were made in}} several of the wind tunnels of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. The speed range was from landing speed up to Mach number, 3. 5. The measurements were made on the steady-state, forced-oscillation equipment. The apparatus measures the rotary derivatives during small-amplitude, single-degree-of-freedom oscillations. In this paper the results of the wind-tunnel tests are compared with the values of the rotary derivatives estimated by the available procedures. Whenever possible, the results of wind-tunnel measurements of the static forces and moments on the X- 15 have been utilized in the estimation procedures to obtain lift-curve slopes and <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> the tail surfaces.

40|$|The present {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the effects of tangential slot and nozzle forebody blowing on the aerodynamic and stability characteristics of the F- 16 C configuration, for up-to- 55 deg alpha and up-to- 20 deg sideslip, was conducted on a 1 / 15 th-scale model at freestream Mach = 0. 4 and Re of 2. 5 million/ft, for one tangential slot-nozzle location and two chordwise jet nozzle locations. Both the slot and the jet nozzles generated large yawing moments at very low blowing rates, over a wide range of alpha and sideslip angles. The <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> the side forces which generated the yawing moments due to slot and nozzle blowing were located in the region of the leading-edge extensions (LEXs); the moments may accordingly be due to the manipulation of the combined forebody and LEX flowfields...|$|R
2500|$|For unguided rockets {{the trim}} {{position}} is typically zero {{angle of attack}} and the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> is defined to be the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> of the resultant flow field on the entire vehicle resulting from a very small angle of attack (that is, the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> in the limit as angle of attack goes to zero).

[...] The normalized normal force coefficient derivative with respect to the angle of attack of each component multiplied by the location of the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> can be used to compute a centroid representing the total <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure.</b> [...] The <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> of the added flow field is behind the center of gravity and the additional force [...] "points" [...] {{in the direction of the}} added angle of attack; this produces a moment that pushes the vehicle back to the trim position.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> [...] is {{the point}} where the total sum of a pressure field acts on a body, causing a force to act through that point. The total force vector acting at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> is the value of the integrated vectorial pressure field. [...] The resultant force and <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> location produce equivalent force and moment on the body as the original pressure field.

500|$|In {{addition}} to the September tropical storm, a possible depression that remained below tropical storm intensity developed in late October. On October 24, a broad area <b>of</b> low <b>pressure</b> was present over the western Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. A possible <b>center</b> <b>of</b> low <b>pressure,</b> attached to a cold front extending southward, had formed within the larger system and moved toward the east. Another <b>center</b> <b>of</b> low <b>pressure</b> formed in the northwestern Caribbean on October 25 and is considered a tropical depression in contemporary research.

500|$|Wind {{flows from}} areas <b>of</b> high <b>pressure</b> to areas <b>of</b> low <b>pressure.</b> [...] This {{is due to}} density {{differences}} between the two air masses. [...] Since stronger high-pressure systems contain cooler or drier air, the air mass is more dense and flows towards areas that are warm or moist, which are in the vicinity <b>of</b> low <b>pressure</b> areas in advance of their associated cold fronts. [...] The stronger the pressure difference, or pressure gradient, between a high-pressure system and a low-pressure system, the stronger the wind. The coriolis force caused by the Earth's rotation is what gives winds within high-pressure systems their clockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected right from the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> high <b>pressure)</b> and counterclockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected left from the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> high <b>pressure).</b> [...] Friction with land slows down the wind flowing out of high-pressure systems and causes wind to flow more outward than would be the case in the absence of friction.

2500|$|In guided {{missiles}} {{where the}} fins {{can be moved}} to trim the vehicles in different angles of attack, the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> is the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> of the flow field at that angle of attack for the undeflected fin position. [...] This is the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> of any small change in the angle of attack (as defined above). [...] Once again for positive static stability, this definition of <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> requires that the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> {{be further from the}} nose than the center of gravity.

40|$|A general {{three-dimensional}} contact, between elastically similar half-spaces, is considered. With a fixed normal load, {{we consider}} a pure relative tangential translation {{between the two}} bodies. We show that, for the case of negligible Poisson's ratio, an exact solution is given by a single component of shearing traction, {{in the direction of}} loading. It is well known that, for full sliding conditions, the tangential force must be applied through the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pressure</b> distribution. Instead, for a full stick case the tangential force must be applied through the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pressure</b> distribution under a rigid flat indenter whose planform is the contact area of the problem under consideration. Finally, for finite friction a partial slip regime has to be introduced. It is shown that this problem corresponds to a difference between the actual normal contact problem, and a corrective problem corresponding to a lower load, but with same rotation of the actual normal indentation. Therefore for a pure translation to occur in the partial slip regime, the point of application of the tangential load must follow the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the difference' <b>pressure.</b> The latter also provides a complete solution of the partial slip problem. In particular, the general solution in quadrature is given for the axisymmetric case, where it is also possible to take into account of the effect of Poisson's ratio, as shown in the Appendix...|$|R
