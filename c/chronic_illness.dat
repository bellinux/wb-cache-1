Sterret continued to cruise the Caribbean, taking several more prizes before returning home. Upon Shaw's return home the president and other public officials personally thanked him for his service. Shaw later continued his naval career, serving with distinction during the War of 1812.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present {{empirical}} evidence of the importance of socio-economic conditions for health. Simulation models of health care systems should take into account social and economic factors in order to represent reality more adequately. This paper is concerned with the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>illnesses</b> in Finland for the years 1964 and 1968. Three different methods of analysis of variance are used to establish quantitative relationships between the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>illnesses</b> and socio-economic factors such as income of family head, quantity of medical supplies, and distance to the nearest physician. A strong inverse relationship between the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>illnesses</b> and income was found to be about ten times higher than the relationship between <b>chronic</b> <b>illnesses</b> and medical supply variables...|$|R

Schistosomiasis, {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human skin. The people most at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.|$|E

30|$|In summary, the MI {{appears to}} be the most {{accurate}} approach to describing <b>chronic</b> <b>illnesses</b> and would therefore seem to be a much more appropriate tool than survival analysis.

25|$|Patients {{and their}} parents must receive psychotherapy, which should include {{marriage}} counselling. Mitigation of lasting psychological problems, including depression secondary to <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can be very successfully addressed with early interventions. This care may come from the family physician, or other attending physician, whoever is more appropriate; specialist care is generally not required. Lewis and Vitulano (2003) note several studies suggesting predisposal for psychopathology in paediatric patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>illness.</b> Esch (2002) advocates preventive psychiatry supports to facilitate balance {{of positive and negative}} stressors associated with chronic physical pathology. Patients with FSS should have pre-emptive and ongoing mixed cognitive therapy-psychodynamic psychotherapy for patients with FSS and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), if begun after onset of obvious pathology.|$|E

25|$|Malnutrition {{can be a}} {{consequence}} of health issues such as gastroenteritis or <b>chronic</b> <b>illness,</b> especially the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Diarrhea and other infections can cause malnutrition through decreased nutrient absorption, decreased intake of food, increased metabolic requirements, and direct nutrient loss.

A leading cause of diarrhea and intestinal worm infections in children in developing countries is lack of sanitation and hygiene.|$|E

However, over half of the juveniles crania (skulls) showed evidence of anemia (iron deficiency). This was represented by what is known as cribra orbitalia. This implies that the society had many young children with <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> before their death.|$|E
25|$|Prisons in wealthy, {{industrialized nations}} provide {{medical care for}} most of their inmates.

Prison populations are largely from poor minority communities that experience greater rates of <b>chronic</b> <b>illness,</b> substance abuse, and mental illness than the general population. This leads to a high demand for medical services, and in countries such as the US that don't provide free healthcare, prison is often the first place that people are able to receive medical treatment (which they couldn't afford outside).|$|E
