25|$|The Lawrance A-3 or Lawrance Model A was an American {{twin-cylinder}} aircraft piston engine. Designed by Charles Lawrance in the mid-1910s {{the engine}} was produced by the Lawrance Aero Engine Company and under license by Excelsior. Weighing 200lb (90kg) the engine produced 28horsepower (21kW). A feature of this engine was the shared use of a single <b>crankpin</b> for both cylinders, this caused vibration as the pistons moved in the same direction.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} are locomotives with a {{steam engine}} that provides adhesion. Coal, petroleum, or wood is burned in a firebox, boiling {{water in the}} boiler to create pressurized steam. The steam travels through the smokebox before leaving via the chimney or smoke stack. In the process, it powers a piston that transmits power directly through a connecting rod (US: main rod) and a <b>crankpin</b> (US: wristpin) on the driving wheel (US main driver) or to a crank on a driving axle. Steam locomotives have been phased out {{in most parts of}} the world for economical and safety reasons, although many are preserved in working order by heritage railways.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} crossplane {{crankshaft}} for a 90° V8 engine has four <b>crankpins,</b> each serving two cylinders on opposing banks, offset at 90° from the adjacent <b>crankpins.</b> The {{first and last}} of the four crank pins are at 180° with {{respect to each other}} as are the second and third, with each pair at 90° to the other, so that viewed from the end the crankshaft forms a cross. The <b>crankpins</b> are therefore in two planes crossed at 90°, hence the name crossplane. A crossplane V8 crankshaft may have up to nine main bearings {{in the case of an}} eight throw design, and usually has five bearings supporting four throws each with a shared crank pin.|$|R

2500|$|On February 1, 1994, {{the company}} filed a sound {{trademark}} application for the distinctive {{sound of the}} Harley-Davidson motorcycle engine: [...] "The mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicant's motorcycles, produced by V-twin, common <b>crankpin</b> motorcycle engines when the goods are in use". Nine of Harley-Davidson's competitors filed comments opposing the application, arguing that cruiser-style motorcycles of various brands use a single-crankpin V-twin engine which produce a similar sound. [...] These objections were followed by litigation. In June 2000, the company dropped efforts to federally register its trademark.|$|E
2500|$|By 1912 he {{had built}} the Anzani 10, a 10-cylinder engine, {{air-cooled}} like its predecessors, which, like other Anzani engines, was made with different size cylinders. One of the more powerful versions produced about 110hp (82kW) from 12.1 litres, a British-built Anzani 10 was rated at 125hp and a smaller version with a displacement of 8.27 litres produced 80hp (60kW). [...] It was a double row engine, built with two rows of five cylinders separated along the crankshaft by about a cylinder radius, giving the engine a slimmer profile than other contemporary two-row radial engines. [...] Each half had its own <b>crankpin,</b> 180° apart, with the connecting rods, of chrome nickel steel, broad and flat to bring the two halves close together. [...] Cylinder heads and pistons were made of cast iron, the latter machined inside and out and fitted {{with a pair of}} rings. [...] Oil was forced through the crankshaft to the crankpins, then moved under centrifugal force to the cylinders and pistons from inside the crankcase which was a single light alloy casting.|$|E

5000|$|A simple 90° V6 cannot {{achieve the}} same {{smoothness}} with only crankshaft counterweights, and if the 90° V6 uses shared <b>crankpins</b> like the V8, the engine will have uneven firing intervals, {{such as in the}} original [...] "odd-fire" [...] Buick V6 engine. This uneven firing interval results in roughness at idle and low RPM, and varying harmonics at higher engine speeds, making the [...] "odd-fire" [...] configuration unpopular with buyers, so most manufacturers now use split <b>crankpins</b> to make the firing intervals an even 120°. Therefore, designing a smooth V6 engine is a much more complicated problem than the straight-6, flat-6, and V8 layouts. Although the use of offset <b>crankpins,</b> counterweights, and flying arms has reduced the problem to a minor second-order vibration in modern designs, all V6s can benefit from the addition of auxiliary balance shafts to make them completely smooth.|$|R

2500|$|The {{cylinders}} are double-acting, with steam {{admitted to}} {{each side of the}} piston in turn. In a two-cylinder locomotive, one cylinder is located {{on each side of the}} vehicle. The cranks are set 90° out of phase. During a full rotation of the driving wheel, steam provides four power strokes; each cylinder receives two injections of steam per revolution. The first stroke is to the front of the piston and the second stroke to the rear of the piston; hence two working strokes. Consequently, two deliveries of steam onto each piston face in the two cylinders generates a full revolution of the driving wheel. Each piston is attached to the driving axle on each side by a connecting rod, and the driving wheels are connected together by coupling rods to transmit power from the main driver to the other wheels. Note that at the two [...] "dead centres", when the connecting rod is on the same axis as the <b>crankpin</b> on the driving wheel, the connecting rod applies no torque to the wheel. Therefore, if both cranksets could be at [...] "dead centre" [...] at the same time, and the wheels should happen to stop in this position, the locomotive could not start moving. Therefore, the crankpins are attached to the wheels at a 90° angle to each other, so only one side can be at dead centre at a time.|$|E
2500|$|Each piston transmits power {{directly}} through a connecting rod (Main rod in the US) and a <b>crankpin</b> (Wristpin in the US) on the driving wheel (Main {{driver in the}} US) or to a crank on a driving axle. The movement of the valves in the steam chest is controlled {{through a set of}} rods and linkages called the valve gear, actuated from the driving axle or from the crankpin; the valve gear includes devices that allow reversing the engine, adjusting valve travel and the timing of the admission and exhaust events. The cut-off point determines the moment when the valve blocks a steam port, [...] "cutting off" [...] admission steam and thus determining the proportion of the stroke during which steam is admitted into the cylinder; for example a 50% cut-off admits steam for half the stroke of the piston. The remainder of the stroke is driven by the expansive force of the steam. Careful use of cut-off provides economical use of steam and in turn reduces fuel and water consumption. The reversing lever (Johnson bar in the US), or screw-reverser (if so equipped), that controls the cut-off therefore performs a similar function to a gearshift in an automobile – maximum cut-off, providing maximum tractive effort at the expense of efficiency, is used to pull away from a standing start, whilst a cut-off as low as 10% is used when cruising, providing reduced tractive effort, and therefore lower fuel/water consumption.|$|E

5000|$|A V12 {{engine is}} a V engine with 12 {{cylinders}} {{mounted on the}} crankcase in two banks of six cylinders each, usually but not always at a 60° angle to each other, with all 12 pistons driving a common crankshaft. Since each cylinder bank is essentially a straight-six which is by itself in both primary and secondary balance, a V12 inherits perfect primary and secondary balance no matter which V angle is used, and therefore it needs no balance shafts. A four-stroke 12 cylinder engine has an even firing order if cylinders fire every 60° of crankshaft rotation, so a V12 with cylinder banks at a multiples of 60° (60°, 120°, or 180°) will have even firing intervals without using split <b>crankpins.</b> By using split <b>crankpins</b> or ignoring minor vibrations, any V angle is possible. The 180° configuration is usually {{referred to as a}} [...] "flat-twelve engine" [...] or a [...] "boxer" [...] although it is in reality a 180° V since the pistons can and normally do use shared <b>crankpins.</b> It may also be written as [...] "V-12", although this is rare.|$|R

40|$|Classifying {{components}} {{at the end}} of life (EOL) into remanufacture, {{repair or}} dispose is still a major concern to automotive industries. Prior to this study, no specific approach is reported as a guide line to determine critical <b>crankpins</b> that justifying economical remanufacturing process. Traditional cost accounting (TCA) has been used widely by remanufacturing industries but this is not a good measure of estimating the actual manufacturing costs per unit as compared to activity based costing (ABC). However, the application of ABC method in estimating remanufactured cost is rarely reported. These issues were handled separately without a proper integration to make remanufacturing decision which frequently results into uneconomical operating cost and finally the decision becomes less accurate. The aim of this work is to develop a suitable pattern recognition method for classifying crankshaft into three different EOL groups and subsequently evaluates the critical and non-critical <b>crankpins</b> of the used crankshaft using Mahalanobis-Taguchi System (MTS). A remanufacturability assessment technique was developed using Microsoft Excel spreadsheet on pattern recognition and critical <b>crankpins</b> evaluation, and finally integrates these information into a similar spreadsheet with ABC to make decision whether the crankshaft is to be remanufactured, repaired or disposed. The developed scatter diagram was able to recognize group pattern of EOL crankshaft which later was successfully used to determine critical <b>crankpins</b> required for remanufacturing process. The proposed method can serve as a useful approach to the remanufacturing industries for systematically evaluate and decide EOL components for further processing.

50|$|A 90° V-twin will, with {{a correct}} counterweight, yield perfect primary balance, {{although}} its firing intervals are uneven.
