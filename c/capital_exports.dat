They find that the tax credits system introduces an antitrade bias into the equilibrium, contrary to initial impressions, and that both <b>capital</b> <b>exporting</b> and <b>capital</b> importing countries will prefer the tax-deductions scheme to tax credits.

He subsequently published his views in the press and specialized websites, followed by a working paper that analyzed the issue in detail. He also discussed Germany's <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> since the introduction of the euro and the prospects such exports could face if the euro crisis continues and leads to the introduction of Eurobonds, which he opposes.

During the 1930s, the United States raised trade barriers, refused to act as an international lender of last resort, and refused calls to cancel war debts, all of which further aggravated economic hardship for other countries. According to economist John Maynard Keynes, another factor contributing to the turbulent economic performance of this era was the insistence of French premier Clemenceau that Germany pay war reparations at too high a level, which Keynes described in his book The Economic Consequences of the Peace.|$|E
50|$|Shortly thereafter, Sinn {{interpreted}} the Target balances {{for the first}} time within the context of current account deficits, international private capital movements and the international shifting of the refinancing credit that the national central banks of the Eurosystem grant to the commercial banks in their jurisdiction. He proved that the ECB system compensated the interruption and reversal in capital flows triggered by the financial crisis by shifting refinancing credit among national central banks. The increase in Target liabilities is a direct measure of net payment orders across borders, i.e. of the portion of the current account deficit that is not counterbalanced by capital imports, or, equivalently, the sum of the current account deficit and net <b>capital</b> <b>exports.</b> Indirectly, they also measure a country's amount of central bank money created and lent out beyond what is needed for domestic circulation. Since every country needs a relatively steady amount of central bank money for its domestic transactions, payment orders to other countries, which reduce the domestic stock of money, must be offset by a continuous issuing of new refinancing credit, i.e., the creation of new central bank money. Similarly, the increase in money balances in the country whose central bank honours the payment orders reduces the demand for fresh refinancing credit. Hence, a country's Target liabilities also indicate the extent to which its central bank has replaced the capital markets to finance its current account deficit, as well as any possible capital flight, by creating new central bank money through corresponding refinancing credit. Sinn illustrated that from an economic perspective, Target credit and formal rescue facilities serve the same purpose and involve similar liability risks. Sinn's presentation on 19 May 2011 at the Munich Economic Summit motivated an op-ed column in the Financial Times. They reconstructed the data {{on the basis of the}} balance sheets of the Eurosystem's national central banks and the balance-sheet statistics of the International Monetary Fund.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question whether}} voters would favor a restriction on <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> to the East, and if so, to what extent. In a two country framework, it is shown that an unrestricted capital outflow is not optimal, {{in the traditional sense}} of a social welfare maximizing benevolent dictator. Furthermore, capital export may lead to unemployment and a loss of output in the exporting country if a minimum wage constraint comes into effect. Nevertheless, it may still be optimal to encounter a certain loss in employment and production because of a positive factor terms of trade effect. The preferences of individuals who are differently endowed with 'capital and labor depend on their endowment ratio: E. g., an individual whose capital-labor endowment ratio exceeds the figure for the economy will prefer less-than-optimal curbing of capital outflow. If the policy concerning <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> is decided upon via majority voting, it is the median voter's optimal policy that is finally adopted.

40|$|The {{world economy}} {{experienced}} extensive international economic {{integration in the}} second half of the nineteenth century. This period was also the era of imperial expansion and massive <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> from Britain to the rest of the world. One of the destinations for these gigantic <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> was the British Empire. During this first wave of globalization Britain pioneered and sustained free trade quite successfully–at least in its empire. ^ The purpose of this research is twofold. First, this dissertation seeks to learn whether the impact of free trade in the British Empire on both Britain and her major overseas possessions was beneficial or not. In particular, the first chapter analyzes the impact of colonial exports on colonial growth in the six main British overseas territories that were the greatest recipients of British capital exports: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Egypt and South Africa. The results are inconclusive. In India, we find no relationship between exports and growth. GDP growth seems to be export led in Australia and New Zealand. A positive correlation between GDP growth and export growth was found in Canada, South Africa and Egypt, yet the direction of this relationship and the mechanism of how exports impact GDP are less clear. ^ The second chapter examines whether colonial trade was beneficial for Britain. In essence, the study assesses whether colonial imports contributed to the growth of the British economy. We find that colonial trade via imports was growth enhancing for Britain. ^ Second, this dissertation seeks to learn how British imperialism influenced institutional development in the colonies. More specifically, the third chapter examines whether British <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> promoted institutional development in places where they were absorbed. In this regard, two questions are addressed: first, whether colonial institutions improved or became worse under British rule, and second, whether the institutional gap between Britain and a given colony under investigation narrowed or widened. ^ The results are striking. First, they indicate that good institutions followed <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> in the British Empire. Second, they show that colonial institutions in places which absorbed British <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> were improving at a faster pace than institutions in Britain itself Third, we find that, in some instances, colonial institutions were better than coinciding institutions in Britain. ...|$|E

An original database of German <b>capital</b> <b>exports,</b> comparable to Stone's (1999) data for British capital flows was compiled for the period 1883 - 1913. Three classes of variables were tested as determinants of capital flows: political conditions in recipient countries, long-term prospects of growth, and institutional characteristics. The empirical analysis supports the view that German capital flows responded to long-term prospects of growth of recipient countries ("fundamentals") as much as British investment.

40|$|In recent years, global {{imbalances}} have channeled {{the excess}} savings of surplus countries toward {{the real estate}} markets of deficit countries. By consequence, the deficit countries that attracted lots of foreign capital experienced large run-ups in house prices while the surplus countries that <b>exported</b> <b>capital</b> exhibited flat or slow house price growth. We argue that international capital flows affect the fiscal policy preferences of both voters and political parties by way of their impact on housing prices. Where capital inflows are large and housing prices are rising, we expect voters to respond by demanding both lower taxes and less publicly-provided social insurance. This is because rising house prices allow homeowners to “self insure” against income losses due to unemployment, illness, and old age. We present survey evidence that supports this claim. Furthermore, we find that responses to house prices are mirrored in <b>capital</b> <b>exporting</b> countries: households become more supportive of both taxes and social insurance as home prices remain flat or decline. Finally, we show that political parties are the mechanisms through which the fiscal preferences of households find policy expression. Taxes and social insurance spending tend to fall (rise) where the right (left) is in power and capital inflows are driving up housing prices.
