40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} {{mathematical}} model for proba-bilistic ripple-carry adders. The model gives explicit expressions for <b>calculating</b> <b>error</b> probabilities of sum and carry bits. The expressions show how errors propagate through the carry, which accumulate and eventually influence the correctness of a ripple-carry adder’s outputs. The proposed model is flexible since it only requires mild assumptions on the probability distribution of noise. Hence, in addition to Gaussian, it is applicable to a wide class of distributions. We validate the model through HSPICE simulation. The model is able to predict error-rates of a simulated probabilistic ripple-carry adder with reasonable accuracy.
