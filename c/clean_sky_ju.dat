40|$|Cross-positioned {{within the}} <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> Programme, the Technology Evaluator (TE) is a {{dedicated}} evaluation platform. It has the key role of assessing {{the environmental impact}} of the technologies developed in <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> and their level of success towards the ACARE environmental goals. TE assessments consider all promising green technologies selected by Clean Sky´s ITDs (Integrated Technology Demonstrator platforms) in which these technologies are developed and clustered in coherent and mutually compatible solution sets, identifying optimized new future aircraft solutions. The ITDs are: •	Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft (SFWA) addressing large aircraft technologies •	Green Regional Aircraft (GRA) addressing regional aircraft technologies •	Green Rotorcraft (GRC) addressing rotorcraft technologies •	Sustainable And Green Engines (SAGE) addressing engine technologies •	Systems for Green Operations (SGO) addressing aircraft systems The ITD technologies are integrated into simplified conceptual aircraft performance models in order to evaluate the <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> technology solution sets at aircraft level. These aircraft are named <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> concept aircraft. Using these <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> concept aircraft as a basis the TE conducts assessments at three levels: •	Aircraft level At aircraft level the environmental evaluation of a single flight is performed. To this end a <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> concept aircraft and its reference technology aircraft are compared along the same reference trajectory {{in order to determine the}} environmental benefit of the <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> technologies. The main environmental indicators considered are noise on ground, fuel burn and emissions (CO 2 and NOX). •	Airport level At airport level the environmental impact on local communities around an airport is assessed. To this end a year 2020 airport traffic scenario with reference technology aircraft is compared with the same traffic scenario but in which <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> concept aircraft replace their reference technology counterpart. The main metrics at airport level are noise on the ground, population impacted by certain noise levels, and emissions (CO 2 and NOX). •	Air transport system (ATS) level At ATS level {{the environmental impact of}} <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> technologies is quantified at global scale. To this end a year 2020 fleet traffic scenario with reference technology aircraft is compared with the same traffic scenario but in which <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> concept aircraft replace their reference technology counterpart. Fuel burn and emissions (CO 2 and NOX) are the main indicators of interest at ATS level.

40|$|<b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> is a Joint Technology Initiative {{that aims}} to develop and mature {{breakthrough}} ‘clean technologies’ for air transport. The programme {{is made up of}} 6 Integrated Technology Demonstrators (ITD) and the Technology Evaluator (TE), a dedicated evaluation platform. The TE is in charge of assessing the performance of the technologies developed in the ITDs in order to monitor progress towards the ACARE environmental goals and to provide views on aviation footprint in terms of emissions and noise. The assessments are done via a tool suite with state-of-the-art models for simulating air traffic and assessing environmental impacts as well as aircraft models developed specifically by ITDs to represent the environmental performance of their Concept and Reference Technology Aircraft. This reflects an attempt to pool know-how and simulation/modelling capability that exists among industry, research establishments and academia. The approach in the TE is to ‘insert’ 2020 <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> concept aircraft into a number of evaluation scenarios. These concept aircraft are ‘flown’ (i. e. simulation scenarios are run) and the <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> configurations are compared to the most relevant benchmarks: mainly state-of-the-art aircraft of similar size and role in year 2000 (ACARE’s baseline). The comparisons or assessments are performed at three levels: Mission Level (single flight), Airport Level (community impact), and System Level (global fleet footprint) – and quantify reductions wrt. emissions (CO 2, NOx) and noise. This presentation will provide information on the applied methodologies and will embed this into the bigger picture – related to this session – of evolving European assessment capabilities...|$|R
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{describes a}} collaborative research effort {{between members of}} the <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> Joint Technology Initiative (JTI), within the broader area of novel rotorcraft engine technology and rotorcraft operations. The <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> JTI was created as a public/private partnership between the European Commission and the aeronautical industry. The paper assesses the impact of innovative engine technologies to {{be integrated into the}} next generation of rotorcraft and evaluates their potential towards meeting the ACARE 2020 goals. The focus is on the lower segment of the light helicopter class with a particular interest in the performance of two innovative powerplants: an advanced turboshaft with Lean Premixed Prevaporised (LPP) combustor design and a supercharged diesel cycle engine. In order to evaluate their benefits alongside other <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> technologies, a multi-disciplinary rotorcraft performance analysis framework (PhoeniX) is employed. Two variants of the same light helicopter platform with year 2020 technology plus <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> innovations are modelled, named hereafter as Single Engine Light (SEL) Y 2020 and High Compression Engine (HCE) Y 2020, respectively. A turboshaft engine-powered helicopter, representative of year 2000 technology (SEL Y 2000) is also modelled and used as reference. Payload-Range diagrams (PR) of the three vehicles were generated. The HCE Y 2020 reached a maximum range 83 % greater than the SEL counterparts. The gaseous emissions of the helicopters were also evaluated over three notional scenarios representative of light helicopter activities. The HCE Y 2020 emitted 60 % less carbon dioxide (CO 2) and 63 % less nitrogen oxides (NOx) than the SEL Y 2000. The SEL Y 2020 emitted on average 19 % and 49 % less CO 2 and NOx, respectively, compared with the SEL Y 2000. It was also observed that the NOx production rate of the LPP technology integrated in the SEL Y 2020 combustor depends strongly on engine power setting. At certain power settings, the SEL Y 2020 emitted less NOx than the HCE Y 2020 even though the HCE Y 2020 emitted less NOx over the complete mission. The direct comparison between SEL Y 2020 and HCE Y 2020 highlighted the superior performance of the HCE engine over the gas turbine for the mission types and rotorcraft class simulated...|$|R

The aim of <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> is to develop and integrate new and innovative technologies that will hel p meeting the emission and noise reduction targets set by the Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe (ACARE) for aircraft of next generation. The GRC and SAGE ITDs are responsible for developing new helicopter airframe and engine t echnologies respectively, whilst the TE has the distinctive role of assessing {{the environmental impact of}} these technologies at single flight (mission), airport and Air Transport System levels (ATS). Cranfield University {{as a member of the}} TE is responsibl e for the mission trajectory definition and for conducting the environmental performance assessments. The assessments reported herein have been performed by using a GRC - developed multi - disciplinary simulation framework called PhoeniX (Platform Hosting Oper ational and Environmental Investigations for Rotorcraft) that comprises various computational modules. These modules include a rotorcraft performance code (EUROPA), an engine performance and emissions simulation tool (GSP) and a noise prediction code (HELE NA). PhoeniX can predict the performance of a helicopter along a prescribed 4 D trajectory offering a complete helicopter mission analysis. In the context of the TE assessments reported herein, three helicopter classes are examined, namely a Twin Engine Lig ht (TEL) configuration, for Emergency Medical Service (EMS) and Police missions, and a Single Engine Light (SEL) configuration for Passenger/Transport missions, and a Twin Engine Heavy (TEH) configuration for Oil & Gas missions.
