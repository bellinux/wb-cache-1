40|$|Abstract. With {{the help}} of the {{orthogonal}} experiment and the friction-wear mechanism by car as the research object of the <b>clutch</b> <b>driven</b> platen friction plate of Chongqing Changan CX 20 auto power take-off installation, the optimization of clutch friction materials is studied. It was selected for the resin-base fiber materials of <b>clutch</b> <b>driven</b> platen to be commonly used in auto mechanical manufacture. It was analyzed for the abrasion mechanism of the <b>clutch</b> <b>driven</b> platen friction plate between the flywheel and the pressure plate,and discussed for the relationship of driven platen friction-plate heat recession-performance and the driven plate material at high temperature. The results show that the friction factor of the optimized driven platen lining materials do not change. In the process of the frequent friction heating to high temperature, the stability of the optimized driven platen lining materials is strong, the wear of those is reduced, and the optimized driven platen lining materials have good performance of high temperature-thermal recession...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} new methodologies {{pertaining to}} on-board diagnosis of wear-out rate for friction linings of a <b>clutch</b> <b>driven</b> disk and friction discs of a hydraulic press clutch of transmission gear boxes {{which are based}} on physical process that uses friction work as an integrated indicator. A new methodology in determination of life-span rate for engine oil has been developed in the paper. The paper presents block schematic diagrams for on-board monitoring of technical state for power units of wheeled and tracked vehicles.  Usage of friction work as an integrated indicator for determination of wear-out rate for friction linings of <b>clutch</b> <b>driven</b> disk and friction discs of a haydraulic press clutch makes it possible timely at any operational period of wheeled and tracked vehicles to determine their residual operation life and forecast their replacement. While taking volume of the used fuel for determination of engine oil life-span rate it permits quickly and effectively at any operational period of wheeled and tracked vehicles to determine residual useful life of the engine oil and also forecast its replacement. </p...|$|E

5000|$|Unusually, the {{turbopump}} for {{the engine}} was mechanically driven from outside. A mechanical drive shaft from the accessory drive of the main turbojet provided the [...] needed at 5,070 rpm, provided that {{the engine was}} running at full speed.

25|$|In DCTs {{where the}} two {{clutches}} are arranged concentrically, the larger outer <b>clutch</b> <b>drives</b> the odd-numbered gears and the smaller inner <b>clutch</b> <b>drives</b> the even-numbered gears. Shifts can be accomplished without interrupting torque distribution to the driven roadwheels, by applying the engine's torque to one clutch {{at the same time}} as it is being disconnected from the other clutch. Since alternate gear ratios can preselect an odd gear on one gear shaft while the vehicle is being driven in an even gear (and vice versa), DCTs are the fastest-shifting road car transmission available and are even able to shift faster than a professional racing driver using a manual transmission. DCTs can even shift more quickly than cars equipped with single-clutch automated-manual transmissions (AMTs), also called single-clutch semiautomatics. Also, with a DCT, shifts can be made more smoothly than with a single-clutch AMT, making a DCT more suitable for conventional road cars.|$|R
