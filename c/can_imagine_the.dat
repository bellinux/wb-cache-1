5|$|Supersymmetry {{severely}} {{restricts the}} possible number of dimensions of a brane. In 1987, Eric Bergshoeff, Ergin Sezgin, and Paul Townsend showed that eleven-dimensional supergravity includes two-dimensional branes. Intuitively, these objects look like sheets or membranes propagating through the eleven-dimensional spacetime. Shortly after this discovery, Michael Duff, Paul Howe, Takeo Inami, and Kellogg Stelle considered a particular compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity {{with one of}} the dimensions curled up into a circle. In this setting, one <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> membrane wrapping around the circular dimension. If the radius of the circle is sufficiently small, then this membrane looks just like a string in ten-dimensional spacetime. In fact, Duff and his collaborators showed that this construction reproduces exactly the strings appearing in type IIA superstring theory.|$|E
5|$|This {{curtailment}} of governors' {{powers as}} the Emperors' representatives may have lessened the political dangers of an all-too-powerful class of Imperial delegates, {{but it also}} severely limited governors' ability to oppose local landed elites, specially those of senatorial status, which, although with reduced opportunities for office holding, retained wealth, social prestige, and personal connections. – specially in relatively peaceful regions without a great military presence. On one occasion, Diocletian had to exhort a proconsul of Africa not to fear the consequences of treading on the toes of the local magnates of senatorial rank. If a governor of senatorial rank himself felt these pressures, one <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> difficulties faced by a mere praeses. That accounts for the strained relationship between the central power and local elites: sometime during 303, an attempted military sedition in Seleucia Pieria and Antioch made Diocletian to extract a bloody retribution on both cities by putting to death a number of their council members for failing their duties of keeping order in their jurisdiction.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} {{of individuals with}} micropsia are aware that their perceptions do not mimic reality. Many <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> actual sizes of objects and distances between objects. It is common for patients suffering from micropsia {{to be able to}} indicate true size and distance despite their inability to perceive objects as they actually are. One specific patient was able to indicate the dimensions of specific objects with her hands. She was also able to estimate the distances between two objects and between an object and herself. She succeeded in indicating horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree positions and did not find it difficult to search for an object in a cluttered drawer, indicating that her figure-ground discrimination was intact despite suffering from micropsia.|$|E
25|$|At {{around the}} same time, as many {{physicists}} were studying the properties of strings, {{a small group of}} physicists was examining the possible applications of higher dimensional objects. In 1987, Eric Bergshoeff, Ergin Sezgin, and Paul Townsend showed that eleven-dimensional supergravity includes two-dimensional branes. Intuitively, these objects look like sheets or membranes propagating through the eleven-dimensional spacetime.

25|$|Located {{in one of}} {{the highest}} points of the property, the Villa (Casa de Serralves) presides majestically over the Park, which opens out in front of it and either side. From its {{implantation}} site, it traces a long longitudinal axis - which extends to the pool {{at the other end of}} the property. In front of the villa, the central parterre establishes an element of continuity between the building’s geometric lines and the sobriety of its overall design. A second, shorter axis – marked by the long Sweetgum Alley - is designed at a right angle to the central axis defined by the Central Parterre. The alley leads into an octagonal clearing which faces the street and the main entrance to the property. Looking back one <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> visitor’s trajectory, from the street towards the building. On the western side of the building, the large door/window of the ground floor salon opens onto the lateral parterre, suggesting continuity between the interior and exterior spaces. Through the huge windows, the garden is an omnipresent feature of the villa (Casa de Serralves) on the ground floor, while the first floor windows offer panoramic views over the park, enabling a better understanding of the spaces and their inter-relations.|$|E

500|$|Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Downs {{music is}} rooted in Americana and draws {{on a number of}} styles, {{including}} blues, folk, ragtime, norteño, rock, and country music. For the songs, Cooder adapted musical language from historical sources and incorporated styles from both North and South American traditions. In his interview on Marketplace, he explained his stylistic approach for Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, stating [...] "to me, these musical styles and sounds are narratives as well. I mean everything about them — if it's an accordion, horns, the banda horns for the immigrant tunes — they all are part of the story. And you can see it then, you <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> Arizona border that's hot, 120 degrees in the shade, dusty. The banda horns are coming from some truck over there."
