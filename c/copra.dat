5|$|Banton has a {{primarily}} agricultural economy, with <b>copra</b> {{farming and}} fishing {{as the main}} sources of livelihood. There is also an indigenous raffia palm handicraft industry. Other crops grown in the island are root crops (such as cassava, sweet potatoes), fruits and vegetables. The locals also engage in livestock raising for local consumption, and small-scale shipbuilding of wooden boats and launches.|$|E
5|$|Diverse {{manufacturers}} {{within the}} city produce industrial-related products such as chemicals, textiles, clothing, and electronic goods. Food and beverages and tobacco products also produced. Local entrepreneurs continue to process primary commodities for export, including rope, plywood, refined sugar, <b>copra,</b> and coconut oil. The food-processing industry {{is one of the}} most stable major manufacturing sector in the city.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{the island}} was leased to Urima Felix, a French Polynesian entrepreneur; he {{established}} a small homestead {{on one of the}} islets and reportedly had plans for development of the atoll. The island is also occasionally visited by Polynesian <b>copra</b> gatherers under agreements with the Kiribati government in Tarawa.|$|E
5|$|About 60 Gilbertese {{civilians were}} {{relocated}} to Fanning island in January 1957 on the <b>copra</b> ship Tungaru, and another 40 on the Tulgai the following month. By mid-March 44 Gilbertese men, 29 women and 56 children remained. By {{the end of}} April, 31 of the men, and all {{the women and children}} hadd been taken to Fanning Island by RAF Hastings. The civilians would remain there for the next three months, before returning to Christmas Island. During the later test series, the Gilbertese civilians remained on the island, marshalled in areas like the military personnel.|$|E
5|$|First sighted by Europeans in 1606, {{claimed by}} the United Kingdom in 1868, {{and part of the}} Republic of Kiribati since the island nation's {{independence}} in 1979, Caroline Island has remained relatively untouched and {{is considered one of the}} world's most pristine tropical islands, despite guano mining, <b>copra</b> harvesting, and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is home to one of the world's largest populations of the coconut crab and is an important breeding site for seabirds, most notably the sooty tern.|$|E
5|$|Leased to S.R. Maxwell and Company, a new {{settlement}} {{was established in}} 1916, this time built entirely upon <b>copra</b> export. Much of the South islet was deforested {{to make way for}} coconut palms, a non-indigenous plant. The business venture, however, went into debt, and the island's settlement slowly decreased in population. By 1926, it was down to only ten residents and by 1936, the settlement consisted of only two Tahitian families before abandonment sometime in the late 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Banton {{is thought}} to be already {{inhabited}} by Filipinos since the pre-colonial period, based on analysis of discovered human remains, coffins, an ancient burial cloth and other archaeological finds by the National Museum in the 1930s. The present settlement was founded in 1622 by the Spanish and is the oldest settlement in the province. During the American colonial period, the municipality changed its name to Jones in honor of American congressman William Jones, who authored the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916. Today, Banton is one of Romblon's thriving municipalities, with an economy dependent on <b>copra</b> farming, fishing, raffia palm weaving, and tourism.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} von Spee withdrew his ships, large {{portions}} of the town had been destroyed. Two entire blocks of Papeete had burnt to the ground before the fires were finally put out. A <b>copra</b> store, a market, and several other buildings and residences were among those destroyed by the shellfire and resulting inferno. While the majority of Papeete's civilians fled to {{the interior of the}} island as soon as the fighting began, a Japanese civilian and a Polynesian boy were both killed by German shellfire. Although the two French vessels in the harbor had been sunk, there were no military casualties on either side and the German vessels took no damage. Overall, the bombardment was estimated in 1915 to have caused over 2million francs' worth of property damage, some of which was recouped through the seizure of a German store on the island. In addition to the seizure of their property, several local Germans were interned and forced to repair the damage von Spee's squadron had caused. Perhaps the most lasting effect of the bombardment on the French was the dramatic fall of <b>copra</b> prices in the region, as local suppliers had previously sold a majority of their produce to German merchants in the area who were now interned. Further havoc and distress spread throughout the island 18 days after von Spee's squadron had left, when rumors started to spread that a second German bombardment was about to begin.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1899, the German {{government}} took formal control, establishing a protectorate. A treaty with Spain, signed on 30 July, ensured German control over several other island {{groups in the}} Pacific, and these {{were added to the}} protectorate of German New Guinea. The economic life of German New Guinea's small population of European and Asian settlers, {{as well as that of}} its Melanesian population, relied heavily on the export of <b>copra</b> and the import of goods and services. It remained a modest outpost, and by August 1914 only 1,273 Europeans lived in the colony, while there was also a small but significant number of Japanese, Chinese and Malays.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with more}} serious {{injuries}} {{had to be}} carried down the track. The usual {{decision as to whether}} it was safe to move someone was simplified by the Japanese, who killed all the wounded they encountered. Only those near death were abandoned. Casualties were held at the aid posts and dressing stations until they could walk, or the Japanese threatened. It took eight or ten Papuan carriers to move each man. Army stretchers rotted and fell apart; the Papuans improvised stretchers from blankets, <b>copra</b> bags and timber cut along the Track. The pace of the withdrawal was dictated by the rate at which casualties could be evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{escalated}} between foreign traders on Samoa and {{the local}} populace, {{due in part to}} controls which Tilley had put in place to protect Samoan farmers from exploitation. Dr. David Starr Jordan, a prominent American biologist doing research in the territory, was so concerned by these tensions that he sent a letter to President Theodore Roosevelt asking that a trader not be made governor of the territory, if a civil administration were created. Shortly after, many traders and locals, including a Samoan tax collector, circulated a petition requesting a change in the way the <b>copra</b> crop was taxed and asking for the Navy to cease governing the territory. The petition was sent to members of Congress and the cause was picked up by California representative Julius Kahn and gathered significant press coverage. This movement eventually reached President Roosevelt; his decision was not to act on the petition.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{civilian}} administration encouraged Japanese {{businessmen and}} settlers to the expand phosphate mining and <b>copra</b> production, which came into commercial existence during the German colonial era. During this time, new infrastructure was built between towns—including road and harbour facilities, and electricity and sewerage lines were laid out. Immigration from Japan, Okinawa and Korea to Palau intensified {{as a result}} of new job opportunities. A state-owned enterprise, Nanyo Kohatsu Kabushiki Kaisha (South Seas Colonization Corporation) was formed in 1936 to streamline the islands' economic activities with the administration objective of developing the islands' self-sufficiency capabilities. In the late 1930s, Japanese pearl divers made regular visits to the Arafura Sea, and stopped by Palau from October to April. The influx of pearl divers from Japan {{led to the development of}} the island's tourist industry, and some Japanese settlers from Saipan opened new cafés, geisha houses and liquor houses in Koror to cater to the pearl divers during their stopovers in between October to April.|$|E
5|$|The three {{ships were}} the Italian 8,500-ton {{merchant}} vessel Duchessa d'Aosta, the second a large German tug Likomba, the third a diesel-powered barge Bibundi. Duchessa d'Aosta had a working radio which {{was considered a}} threat, {{with the potential to}} provide details of Allied naval movements. Her declared cargo was 3 million pounds of wool, 316,610 pounds of hides and skins, 1.3 million pounds of tanning materials, 4 million pounds of <b>copra,</b> 544,660 pounds of crude asbestos fibre and over 1.1 million ingots of electrolytic copper. The first page of the ship's cargo manifest, was not presented to the port authorities and the ship's captain refused to provide them with any details, which led to speculation it was also carrying arms or ammunition. In his visits to the island, SOE agent Leonard Guise kept the ships under observation, and in August 1941 submitted a plan to seize Likomba and disable Duchessa d'Aosta. Approval for the military operation in a neutral port was given by the Admiralty on 20 November 1941.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Rewa {{affected}} Papua New Guinea on {{two separate}} occasions {{while it was}} active, with the cyclone first affecting the archipelago between 28December and 1January, before grazing the archipelago between 12-14January. Before Rewa affected the country, cyclone alerts and warnings were issued for Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands, while authorities urged people {{not to go to}} beaches. As it affected the archipelago, Rewa brought heavy rainfall, high seas, and wind gusts of up to 100km/h (60mph) to parts of the archipelago including Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands. The hardest hit areas were communities near major river systems, with the cyclone blocking roads, destroying a church, bridges, homes and gardens with vital crops such as coffee and <b>copra</b> destroyed. In total, Cyclone Rewa left around 3500people homeless and caused 17deaths, 8 of which were due to flooding. Nine other people went missing while travelling to Rossel Island after their boat was caught up in high seas associated with Rewa. They were later presumed dead by the National Disaster and Emergency Service, after a local search and rescue mission found wreckage of the boat. At 00:00UTC on 30December, the automatic weather station at Jingo on Rossel island recorded a maximum sustained wind of 55km/h (35mph).|$|E
5|$|On Samar, where Amy first struck, reports {{indicated}} that 27people died, despite initial reports that stated {{that there were}} no fatalities. In Iloilo City on Visayas, two people were killed and seventeenothers were injured. Property damage in Bacolod, Negros was estimated at $250,000, and 52people died, with an additional 2,250persons rendered homeless. Elsewhere on Negros, 30percent of the island's vital sugar crop was destroyed. On the east coast of Leyte, the typhoon was considered the worst in living memory, and ninety percent of homes there were destroyed. In Negros Oriental, schoolhouses in Canlaon, Vallehermoso, Negros Oriental, and Guihulngan were blown down. An aerial survey mission estimated that at least of coconut plantations were devastated; other coconut plantations throughout the Philippines also suffered considerable damage. <b>Copra</b> crops also suffered sizeable losses, though production was expected to remain at forecast levels. Tacloban's San Jose Airfield was severely damaged by the strong storm surge from Amy. In the Tacloban and Surigao Strait area, an estimated 146people were killed. In the Leytenian town of Abuyog, the mayor had announced that 176people were killed in the town alone. Another 135fatalities were confirmed in Sogod. More than 100persons were injured by falling coconuts and other airborne debris. On Leyte alone, damage was estimated at $8million. The Red Cross estimated over a thousand homes in 41towns on Panay were destroyed by the storm. More than 20percent of crops and infrastructure were destroyed. Four people were killed on the island. Upon looping in the South China Sea, Amy brought torrential rainfall to areas of Manila, though no damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|Sabah's {{economy is}} mainly based on primary sector such as agriculture, {{forestry}} and petroleum. Currently, the tertiary sector {{plays an important}} part to the state economy, especially in tourism and services. With its richness in biodiversity, the state is offering ecotourism. Although {{in recent years the}} tourism industry has been affected by attacks and kidnapping of tourists by militant groups based in the southern Philippines, it remained stable with the increase of security in eastern Sabah and the Sulu Sea. The tourism sector contribute 10% share of the state GDP and was predicted to increase more. Majority of the tourists come from China (60.3%), followed by South Korea (33.9%), Australia (16.3%) and Taiwan (8.3%). Since the 1950s, rubber and <b>copra</b> are the main source of agricultural economy of North Borneo. The timber industry start to emerged in the 1960s due to high demand of raw materials from industrial countries. This was however replaced by petroleum in the 1970s after the discovery of oil in the area of west coast Sabah. In the same year, cocoa and palm oil was added to the list. The Sabah state government managed to increase the state fund from RM6million to RM12billion and poverty was down by almost half to 33.1% in 1980. The state rapid development on primary sector has attracted those job seekers in neighbouring Indonesia and the Philippines as the state labour force itself are not sufficient. The state Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at the time ranked behind Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, being the third richest although the manufacturing sector remained small. However, by 2000, the state started to become the poorest as it still dependent on natural resources as its primary sources of income comparing to those secondary sector producer states. Thus the Sabah Development Corridor (SDC) was established in 2008 by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi with a total investment of RM105billion for 18 years to increase the state GDP to RM63.2billion by 2025. Around RM5.83billion were allocated each year for infrastructures development along with the creation of 900,000 jobs. The federal government targeted to eradicate hardcore poverty by the end Ninth Malaysia Plan (9MP) with overall poverty halved from 23% in 2004 to 12% in 2010 and 8.1% in 2012. Since its establishment in 2008, the state GDP increase to 10.7% which was higher than the national economic growth of 4.8% and the world economic growth of 2.7%. Following the world financial crisis in 2009, Sabah GDP recorded 4.8% growth compared to −1.5% for national level and −0.4% for world level.|$|E
25|$|<b>Copra</b> has {{traditionally}} been grated and ground then boiled in water to extract coconut oil. It was used by Pacific island cultures and became a valuable commercial product for merchants in the South Seas and South Asia in the 1860s. This 19th-century <b>copra</b> trading inspired Robert Louis Stevenson's 1893 novella The Beach of Falesá, based on his experiences in Samoa. Nowadays, the process of coconut oil extraction is performed by crushing <b>copra</b> to produce coconut oil (70%); the by-product is known as <b>copra</b> cake or <b>copra</b> meal (30%).|$|E
25|$|Coconut oil can be {{extracted}} using either mechanical expellers or solvents (hexane). Mechanically expelled <b>copra</b> meal is of higher feeding value, {{because it contains}} typically 8–12% oil, whereas the solvent-extracted <b>copra</b> meal contains only 2–4% oil. Premium quality <b>copra</b> meal can also contain 20–22% crude protein, and <20ppb aflatoxin.|$|E
25|$|In India, Tiptur in Tumkur {{district}} in Karnataka state is notable for its <b>copra.</b> <b>Copra</b> produced here are naturally dried under the shade for nine to twelve months.|$|E
25|$|Mononutu {{would stay}} in Manado for 12 years from 1930 to 1942. During this time, he became the {{director}} of a <b>copra</b> cooperative. The cooperative had around 500 members who were scattered throughout the regions of Minahasa and Bolaang Mongondow. Mononutu was able to secure credit from the People's General Credit Bank or Algemene Volkscredietbank (now Bank Rakyat Indonesia) to cover the debts of the <b>copra</b> farmers. This allowed the farmers to sell their <b>copra</b> to the cooperative, which offered more stabil and standardized prices. The <b>copra</b> was in turn exported through the Nationale Handelsbank, a Dutch bank that was established to finance trade between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Copra</b> meal {{is used as}} {{fodder for}} horses and cattle. Its high oil and protein levels are {{fattening}} for stock. The protein in <b>copra</b> meal has been heat treated and provides a source of high-quality protein for cattle, sheep and deer, {{because it does not}} break down in the rumen.|$|E
25|$|The first Westerner {{to see the}} atoll in the mid-1820s was the Baltic German {{captain and}} {{explorer}} Otto von Kotzebue, sailing in service of the Russian Empire. He visited three times during 1816 and 1817. He named the atoll Eschscholtz Atoll after Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, the naturalist of von Kotzebue's ship. The Baltic Germans used the atoll to produce <b>copra</b> oil from coconuts, although contact with the native population was infrequent. The atoll's climate is drier than the more fertile southern Marshall Islands which produced more <b>copra.</b> Bikini islanders were recruited into developing the <b>copra</b> trade during the German colonial period.|$|E

25|$|While {{there are}} some large {{plantations}} with integrated operations, <b>copra</b> remains primarily a smallholder crop. The major producing country is the Philippines. It is also a major exporter. In former years <b>copra</b> was collected by traders going from island to island and port to port in the Pacific Ocean but South Pacific production is now much diminished, {{with the exception of}} Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.|$|E
25|$|Extensively {{worked for}} guano from 1884 by John T. Arundel & Co, Manra {{was turned into}} a <b>copra</b> {{plantation}} in the early 20th century. In 1938, Manra was selected as one of three atolls for use in the Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme, which represented the last expansion of the British Empire. Plagued by drought and the death of the project's organizer, together with the effects of World War II and the declining <b>copra</b> market, Manra was abandoned in 1963.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy is}} mainly based on tourism. Agriculture is {{important}} near {{the north and}} east coasts, with the chief exports being cocoa, coffee, <b>copra,</b> and palm products.|$|E
25|$|High-quality <b>copra</b> meal {{contains}} <12% non structural carbohydrate (NSC), {{which makes}} it well suited for feeding to horses that are prone to ulcers, insulin resistance, colic, tying up, and acidosis.|$|E
25|$|A {{key event}} {{occurred}} in 1908, {{in a dispute}} between the German colonial administration and the Malo o Samoa, or Samoan Council of Chiefs, over {{the establishment of a}} <b>copra</b> business owned and controlled by native Samoans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Copra</b> {{has been}} classed with {{dangerous}} goods {{due to its}} spontaneously combustive nature. It is identified as a Division 4.2 substance. It has been forbidden by ICAO from flight without the express written permission of a state authorised agency.|$|E
25|$|The prime {{agricultural}} products currently produced in Seychelles include sweet potatoes, vanilla, coconuts and cinnamon. These products provide {{much of the}} economic support of the locals. Frozen and canned fish, <b>copra,</b> cinnamon and vanilla are the main export commodities.|$|E
25|$|Kiribati has few natural resources. Commercially viable {{phosphate}} deposits on Banaba {{were exhausted}} {{at the time}} of independence. <b>Copra</b> and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. Kiribati {{is considered one of the}} least developed countries in the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} Moro Province {{continued}} to expand under Pershing. The {{three most important}} exports – hemp, <b>copra,</b> and lumber – increased 163% during his first three years, and Moros began to make bank deposits {{for the first time}} in their history.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} the staple {{products}} of the region were palm oil and palm kernels. Manufacture of palm oil was mainly considered a job for women. Later exports included <b>copra</b> made from the coconut palm, guinea grains, gum copal, camwood and sesame (benne).|$|E
25|$|The Mau {{movement}} {{emerged as}} an articulated of an indigenous response to the U.S. annexation of the eastern Samoan islands in 1899. It featured the signing of petitions in efforts to enact political transformation vis-a-vis American colonial government, and included effort to resist taxation of <b>copra.</b>|$|E
25|$|On June 20, Captain Glass arrived off {{the shore}} of Guam, and {{he noticed that the}} only ship in the harbor was a Japanese ship that was trading <b>copra.</b> Many of the men on the USS Charleston were {{disappointed}} that there were no Spanish ships to engage.|$|E
