25|$|Theoretically, {{the strong}} static {{magnetic}} fields of MRI scanners can cause physiological changes. After a human neural cell culture {{was exposed to}} a static magnetic field for 15 minutes, changes in <b>cell</b> <b>morphology</b> occurred along with some modifications in the physiological functions of those cells. However, these effects {{have not yet been}} independently replicated or confirmed, and this particular study was performed in vitro.|$|E
25|$|The noncanonical PCP pathway regulates <b>cell</b> <b>morphology,</b> division, and movement. Once again Wnt {{proteins}} binds to and activates Frizzled so that Frizzled activates a Dishevelled {{protein that}} is {{tethered to the}} plasma membrane through a Prickle protein and transmembrane Stbm protein. The active Dishevelled activates RhoA GTPase through Dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (Daam1) and the Rac protein. Active RhoA is able to induce cytoskeleton changes by activating Roh-associated kinase (ROCK) and affect gene transcription directly. Active Rac can directly induce cytoskeleton changes and affect gene transcription through activation of JNK.|$|E
25|$|Electron {{microscopy}} or EM {{can be used}} {{to study}} the detailed microarchitecture of tissues or cells. Immuno-EM allows the detection of specific proteins in ultrathin tissue sections. Antibodies labelled with heavy metal particles (e.g. gold) can be directly visualised using transmission electron microscopy. While powerful in detecting the sub-cellular localisation of a protein, immuno-EM can be technically challenging, expensive, and require rigorous optimisation of tissue fixation and processing methods. Protein biotinylation in vivo was proposed to alleviate the problems caused by frequent incompatibility of antibody staining with fixation protocols that better preserve <b>cell</b> <b>morphology.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{performed}} bonafide age synchronization experiments for Caulobacter crescentus {{and examined}} the <b>cell</b> <b>morphologies</b> of Caulobacters obtained at the various chronological ages and developmental stages. We confirmed that age-homogenous Caulobacter swarmer cells grew first into stalked cells and then predivisional cells with no crossband in their stalk in the first cell divisional cycle. After the first <b>cell</b> division, <b>cell</b> <b>morphologies</b> alternated between stalked cells and predivisional cells in subsequent cell reproduction cycles and one crossband was added into the stalk subsequent to each cell division event. These observations suggest that crossband is a cell reproduction remnant and {{can serve as a}} conservative cell age indicator for Caulobacter...|$|R
25|$|The Wnt protein family {{includes}} {{a large number}} of cysteine-rich glycoproteins. The Wnt proteins activate signal transduction cascades via three different pathways, the canonical Wnt pathway, the noncanonical planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, and the noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. Wnt proteins appear to control a wide range of developmental processes and have been seen as necessary for control of spindle orientation, cell polarity, cadherin mediated adhesion, and early development of embryos in many different organisms. Current research has indicated that deregulation of Wnt signaling plays a role in tumor formation, because at a cellular level, Wnt proteins often regulated cell proliferation, <b>cell</b> <b>morphology,</b> cell motility, and cell fate.|$|E
25|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that biofilms are present on the removed tissue of 80% of patients undergoing surgery for chronic sinusitis. The patients with biofilms were shown to have been denuded of cilia and goblet cells, unlike the controls without biofilms who had normal cilia and goblet <b>cell</b> <b>morphology.</b> Biofilms were also found on samples from two of 10 healthy controls mentioned. The species of bacteria from intraoperative cultures did not correspond to the bacteria species in the biofilm on the respective patient's tissue. In other words, the cultures were negative though the bacteria were present. New staining techniques are being developed to differentiate bacterial cells growing in living animals, e.g. from tissues with allergy-inflammations.|$|E
25|$|Tissue {{preparation}} or fixation {{is essential}} for the preservation of <b>cell</b> <b>morphology</b> and tissue architecture. Inappropriate or prolonged fixation may significantly diminish the antibody binding capability. Many antigens can be successfully demonstrated in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. However, some antigens will not survive even moderate amounts of aldehyde fixation. Under these conditions, tissues should be rapidly fresh frozen in liquid nitrogen and cut with a cryostat. The disadvantages of frozen sections include poor morphology, poor resolution at higher magnifications, difficulty in cutting over paraffin sections, and the need for frozen storage. Alternatively, vibratome sections do not require the tissue to be processed through organic solvents or high heat, which can destroy the antigenicity, or disrupted by freeze thawing. The disadvantage of vibratome sections is that the sectioning process is slow and difficult with soft and poorly fixed tissues, and that chatter marks or vibratome lines are often apparent in the sections.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, {{neural crest}} specifiers {{turn on the}} {{expression}} of effector genes, which confer certain properties such as migration and multipotency. [...] Two neural crest effectors, Rho GTPases and cadherins, function in delamination by regulating <b>cell</b> <b>morphology</b> and adhesive properties.

2500|$|Many {{transcription}} {{factors in}} multicellular organisms {{are involved in}} development. [...] Responding to stimuli, these transcription factors turn on/off the transcription of the appropriate genes, which, in turn, allows for changes in <b>cell</b> <b>morphology</b> or activities needed for cell fate determination and cellular differentiation. [...] The Hox transcription factor family, for example, is important for proper body pattern formation in organisms as diverse as fruit flies to humans. [...] Another example is the transcription factor encoded by the Sex-determining Region Y (SRY) gene, which {{plays a major role}} in determining sex in humans.|$|E
2500|$|Cytocidal {{infections are}} often {{associated}} with changes in <b>cell</b> <b>morphology,</b> physiology and are thus important for the complete viral replication and transformation. [...] Cytopathic Effects, often include a change in cell's morphology such as fusion with adjacent cells to form polykaryocytes {{as well as the}} synthesis of nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. [...] Physiological changes include the insufficient movement of ions, formation of secondary messengers, and activation of cellular cascades to continue cellular activity. [...] Biochemically, many viruses inhibit the synthesis of host DNA, RNA, proteins directly or even interfere with protein-protein, DNA-protein, RNA-protein interactions at the subcellular level. [...] Genotoxicity involves breaking, fragmenting, or rearranging chromosomes of the host. [...] Lastly, biologic effects include the viruses' ability to affect the activity of antigens and immunologlobulins in the host cell.|$|E

25|$|Cell {{shape is}} {{generally}} {{characteristic of a}} given bacterial species, but can vary depending on growth conditions.

2500|$|LIS1 was {{the first}} human {{neuronal}} migration gene to be cloned. [...] It is responsible for encoding the alpha subunit of the intracellular Ib isoform of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase. [...] It is located on chromosome 17p13.3 and has 11 exons with a coding region of 1233bp. [...] LIS1 protein appears to interact with tubulin to suppress microtubule dynamics. [...] The protein is highly conserved and {{studies have shown that}} it participates in cytoplasmic dynein-mediated nucleokinesis, somal translocation, cell motility, mitosis, and chromosome segregation. [...] LIS1 encodes for a 45kDa protein called PAFAH1B1 that contains seven WD40 repeats required for proper neuronal migration. [...] The LIS1 gene encodes for a protein similar to the β subunit of G proteins responsible for degrading bioactive lipid platelet-activating factor (PAF). [...] This leads to theories that LIS1 might exert its effect on migration through microtubules. [...] Specific concentrations of PAF may be necessary for optimal neuronal migration by influencing <b>cell</b> <b>morphology</b> adhesion properties. [...] Studies have shown that addition of PAF or inhibition of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) decreases cerebellar granule cell migration in vitro. [...] Addition of PAF to hippocampal cells have shown growth cone collapse and neurite retraction. [...] LIS1 knockout homozygous null mice die during embryogenesis and heterozygous mice survive with delayed neuronal migration confirmed by in vitro and in vivo cell migration assays.|$|E
60|$|What is more, the {{religious}} folk can {{claim to be}} among the pioneers of Evolutionism. Weismann, Neo-Darwinist though he was, devoted a long passage in his History of Evolution to the Nature Philosophy of Lorenz Oken, published in 1809. Oken defined natural science as 'the science of the everlasting transmutations of the Holy Ghost in the world.' His religion had started him on the right track, and not only led him to think out a whole scheme of Evolution in abstract terms, but guided his aim in a significantly good scientific shot which brought him within the scope of Weismann. He not only defined the original substance from which all forms of life have developed as protoplasm, or, as he called it, primitive slime (Urschleim), but actually declared that this slime took the form of vesicles out of which the universe was built. Here was the modern <b>cell</b> <b>morphology</b> guessed by a religious thinker long before the microscope and the scalpel forced it on the vision of mere laboratory workers who could not think and had no religion. They worked hard to discover the vital secrets of the glands by opening up dogs and cutting out the glands, or tying up their ducts, or severing their nerves, thereby learning, negatively, that the governors of our vital forces do not hold their incessant conversations through the nerves, and, positively, how miserably a horribly injured dog can die, leaving us to infer that we shall probably perish likewise if we grudge our guineas to Harley Street. Lorenz Oken thought very hard {{to find out what was}} happening to the Holy Ghost, and thereby made a contribution of extraordinary importance to our understanding of uninjured creatures. The man who was scientific enough to see that the Holy Ghost is a scientific fact got easily in front of the blockheads who could only sin against it. Hence my uncle was turning his back on very respectable company when he derided Evolution, and would probably have recanted and apologized at once had anybody pointed out to him what a solecism he was committing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{computational}} model {{to investigate the}} coupling between cell’s adhesions and actin fibres and how this coupling affects cell shape and stability. To ac-complish that, we {{take into account the}} successive stages of adhesion maturation from adhesion precursors to focal complexes and ultimately to focal adhesions, as well as the actin fibres evolution from growing filaments, to bundles and finally contractile stress fibres. We use substrates with discrete patterns of adhesive patches, whose inter-patches distance can be modulated in order to control the location of the adhesions and the resulting fibres architecture. We then investigate the emergence of stable <b>cell</b> <b>morphologies</b> {{as a function of the}} inter-patches distance, for two different cell phenotypes generated from the model. Force generated by the stress fibres on the focal adhesions and specifically the influence of the cell contractility are also investigated. Our results suggest that adhesion lifetime and fibre growing rate are the key parameters in the emergence of stable <b>cell</b> <b>morphologies</b> and the limiting factors for the magnitude of the mean tension force from the fibres on the focal adhesions...|$|R
