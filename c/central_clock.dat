It is mediated by a circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain (<b>central</b> <b>clock),</b> which causes the kidney (peripheral clock) to secrete potassium in this rhythmic circadian fashion.|$|E
5|$|Besides, {{there were}} a number of small posterns. The heads and limbs of {{executed}} criminals were regularly displayed above the ports. Of the six ports, the Netherbow was the only one which took the form of a large fortified gateway. Repairs to the Netherbow are recorded in 1538, and a drawing of 1544 shows the Netherbow as a wide arched gate flanked by two round towers. In 1571, the gateway between the towers was rebuilt, and a <b>central</b> <b>clock</b> tower was added above the gateway, topped by an octagonal stone spire. This structure was repaired in the early 17th century.|$|E

500|$|In 1926, Holden {{began the}} design of a new {{headquarters}} for the UERL at 55 Broadway above St. James's Park station. Above the first floor, the steel-framed building was constructed to a cruciform plan and rises in a series of receding stages to a <b>central</b> <b>clock</b> tower [...] tall. The arrangement maximises daylight to the building's interior without the use of light wells. Like his stations of the period and his pre-First World War commercial buildings, the block is austerely clad in Portland stone. Holden again detailed the façades with commissioned sculptures; , two compositions by Epstein, are at first floor level, and a series of eight bas-reliefs at the seventh floor represent the four winds (two for each of the cardinal directions, {{on each side of the}} projecting wings). The building is Grade I listed.|$|E
500|$|The entry complex {{consists}} of a combined gate house and quarters, an entry court and military and civil guard houses with embrasures flanking the inner gate. The two storey limestone gatehouse, with a <b>central</b> <b>clock,</b> presents an imposing entry to the former prison. The gatehouse and associated entry complex was constructed between 1854 and 1855 using convict labour. It was designed by Royal Engineer Edmund Henderson, and constructed out of limestone. The gatehouse has two towers {{either side of a}} narrow gate, reminiscent of those found in 13th century English castles or walled cities. The gate was made from iron [...] which had been scavenged from shipwrecks, while the clock {{at the top of the}} structure was imported from England.

30|$|The correct {{timing of}} the <b>central</b> {{circadian}} <b>clock</b> relative to the environment is essential for optimal sleep, waking functions and health. In humans, the <b>central</b> circadian <b>clock</b> has an average endogenous period slightly greater than 24  h (~ 24.2  h) [23]. Daily input signals are required to shift the clock earlier (phase advance) to synchronize the clock’s timing to the external 24 -h solar day, and light is the strongest zeitgeber (“time giver”) to the <b>central</b> circadian <b>clock.</b> In humans, light in the evening or {{first part of the}} night causes the clock to shift rhythms later (phase delay) and light in the morning shift the clock earlier (phase advance). Thus morning light is essential for producing corrective daily phase advances in humans, while evening light can produce phase delays, which exacerbate the human clock’s endogenous tendency to drift later and promote circadian misalignment. Circadian misalignment can lead to difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness lower quality of life, worsen mood and well-being, worsen depression, reduce cognitive performance and increase rates of myocardial infarction and cancer [20, 21, 24 – 28].|$|R
500|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, {{urbanization}} {{of the city}} due to the geographical feature of [...] "Cruesoe's Island" [...] and surrounding coal mining property created a density not seen in many cities of its size. The city at the time with a population nearing 10,000 was forced to tightly cram homes and businesses upon the sandstone outcropping less than a square mile in diameter leading many to build their buildings with multiple stories around the town square. The Saline County courthouse and square have gone through many transformations within the past 100 years. In the 19th century, the town had dirt streets with a large Greek Revival courthouse with Doric columns built by Swiss-born, Evansville, Indiana Architect J. K. Frick & Co in 1861. The courthouse was then replaced in 1906 with a larger building designed by then well-known architect John W. Gaddis of Vincennes, Indiana. The structure was an identical model to the Perry County Courthouse at Perryville, Missouri, both built the same year. A smaller version of the <b>central</b> <b>clock</b> tower of the courthouse, including the original clock, manufactured by the Howard Clock Company, of Boston Massachusetts in 1904 was recreated in 1996, {{and placed in a}} small lot behind the Clearwave Building's parking lot. The Howard clock company was notable for manufacturing large clocks in such buildings as the Wrigley Building in Chicago, and the Ferry Building in San Francisco, California.

Courthouse was constructed in 1862–65 (dedicated in 1860??), with President James Buchanan in attendance, at {{the northwest corner of}} East Fayette and North Streets (now Guilford Avenue) – site of old colonial, twin-spired First Presbyterian Church; and in 1889 a newer Federal Courthouse, along with a General Post Office, of Italian Renaissance-style with nine towers including a large <b>central</b> <b>clock</b> tower, for the embellishment of the city, was constructed {{on the east side of}} Battle Monument Square at North Calvert and East Fayette Streets.

An acoustic source localization model, which also matches our general model (1), was presented in [62, eq. (6)]. In [4, eq.

The offset of each channel is displayed in histogram form, and "out of specification" alarms are sent to a central complex monitor and control system. At any time, the measurement cycle of 120 signals can be interrupted for diagnostic tests on an individual channel.
