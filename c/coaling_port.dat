2500|$|New Zealand {{occupied}} German Samoa (later Western Samoa) on 30 August 1914. On 11 September, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force {{landed on}} the island of Neu Pommern (later New Britain), which formed part of German New Guinea. On 28 October, the German cruiser sank the Russian cruiser Zhemchug in the Battle of Penang. Japan seized Germany's Micronesian colonies and, after the Siege of Tsingtao, the German <b>coaling</b> <b>port</b> of Qingdao on the Chinese Shandong peninsula. As Vienna refused to withdraw the Austro-Hungarian cruiser [...] from Tsingtao, Japan declared war not only on Germany, but also on Austria-Hungary; the ship participated in the defense of Tsingtao where it was sunk in November 1914. Within a few months, the Allied forces had seized all the German territories in the Pacific; only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in New Guinea remained.|$|E
60|$|They got sail {{upon the}} sloop and drove her {{out into a}} {{confused}} head sea, through which she labored with flooded decks, making very little to windward. When night came, a deluge killed the breeze, {{and the next day}} she lay rolling wildly in a heavy calm while light mist narrowed in the horizon and a persistent drizzle poured down upon the smoothly heaving sea. Then they had light variable winds, and their provisions were once more running out when they drew abreast of a little <b>coaling</b> <b>port.</b> Carroll suggested running in and going on to Victoria by train, but they had hardly decided to do so when the fickle breeze died away and the tide-stream bore them past to the south. They had no longer a stitch of dry clothing and they were again upon reduced rations.|$|E
6000|$|This is what seamen do daily, {{and for one}} another. One lights {{occasionally}} upon different stories. It happened, {{not very}} long since, that the passengers {{by one of the}} great ocean steamers were wrecked, and, after undergoing the most severe hardships, were left, destitute and helpless, at a miserable <b>coaling</b> <b>port.</b> Amongst them were old men, ladies, and children. When the next steamer arrived, the passengers by that steamer took alarm at the haggard and miserable appearance of their unfortunate predecessors, and actually REMONSTRATED WITH THEIR OWN CAPTAIN, URGING HIM NOT TO TAKE THE POOR CREATURES ON BOARD. There was every excuse, of course. The last-arrived steamer was already dangerously full: the cabins were crowded; there were sick and delicate people on board--sick and delicate people who had paid a large price to the company for room, food, comfort, already not too sufficient. If fourteen of us are in an omnibus, will we see three or four women outside and say [...] "Come in, because this is the last 'bus, and it rains?" [...] Of course not: but think of that remonstrance, and of that Samaritan master of the [...] "Purchase" [...] brigantine! ...|$|E

50|$|Dagenham Dock is a {{place in}} the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham in London, England. It is located to the south of Dagenham and on the River Thames. It was once the site of a large <b>coaling</b> <b>port</b> and {{continues}} to be the location of a small terminal licensed to handle coal off-loading. Today the site is used for a number of river-related uses including a 25 acre TDG (now Norbert Dentressangle) depot with around 200 tanks for storage of petrol, distillates, aviation fuel, biofuels, tallow, ethanol, fertilisers, urea etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} started {{construction of}} a pier at Urangan, {{but it was not}} completed until three years later, and the coal owners therefore failed to gain the export coal orders that they obviously hoped for. Due to this, the Burrum coal catered mainly for the local market - between Gympie and Bundaberg - such as railways, industry, gas works, sugar mills and coastal shipping. In the end, it was sugar, not coal, which formed the most important commodity to be handled over the pier, and it never became the <b>coaling</b> <b>port</b> which had been originally intended.|$|E

5000|$|Cardiff's port, {{known as}} Tiger Bay, became - {{for some time}} - the world's most {{important}} <b>coal</b> <b>port,</b> {{and for a few}} years before World War I the tonnage handled at the port outstripped London and Liverpool (however, some statistical tables conflate Barry and Penarth trade figures with Cardiff's, so the role of the <b>coal</b> <b>port</b> can be inflated).
