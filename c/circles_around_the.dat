5|$|At {{various places}} along the coast, {{large numbers of}} QZ bunkers were built in groups of three, linked to each other by a {{prefabricated}} concrete tunnel. Elsewhere bunkers were constructed in groupings around strategic points across the country, or in lines across swathes of territory. Tirana was particularly heavily defended, with thousands of bunkers radiating out in fifty concentric <b>circles</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E

It <b>circles</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> northern shore of Hamilton Harbour and returns to an eastward orientation. The concurrency with Highway6 ends at an interchange where Highway403 continues east and Highway6 travels north towards Guelph. The freeway continues straight for several kilometres and meets the Queen Elizabeth Way and Highway407 at the Freeman Interchange.|$|E
5|$|NY47 {{followed}} the entire alignment of NY204 {{to what is}} now I-390 and continued on Brooks Avenue into Rochester to Genesee Park Boulevard. Route47 turned south onto the street, which <b>circles</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> southwestern quadrant of the city, and followed its length to Genesee Street, where it turned south for a short distance before resuming its eastward alignment on Elmwood Avenue. The route remained on Elmwood Avenue into Brighton, where it turned north onto South Winton Road at Twelve Corners. At Highland Avenue, NY47 reentered Rochester and became North Winton Road at East Avenue (NY96). The route remained on Winton through Rochester and Irondequoit before terminating at Empire Boulevard (then US104, now NY404) just west of Irondequoit Bay.|$|E

5|$|Tuatara {{reproduce}} very slowly, taking 10 to 20 {{years to}} reach sexual maturity. Mating occurs in midsummer; females mate and lay eggs once every four years. During courtship, a male makes his skin darker, raises his crests, and parades toward the female. He slowly walks in <b>circles</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> female with stiffened legs. The female will either submit, and allow the male to mount her, or retreat to her burrow. Males {{do not have a}} penis; they reproduce by the male lifting the tail of the female and placing his vent over hers. The sperm is then transferred into the female, much like the mating process in birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{carousel}} {{is one of}} {{the three}} oldest surviving Dentzel menagerie carousels. Thirty-one of its 42wood-carved animals are horses, 17 standing and 14 jumping. There are also three goats, three giraffes, three deer, one lion, and one tiger. The single lion and tiger are typical of Dentzel-created carousels, as are the three giraffes; Gustav Dentzel's love of that animal resulted in all of his carousels including at least one row of giraffes. The animals are arranged in three <b>circles</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> central mechanism, alternating leaping or jumping horses with stationary animals. Typical for a Mangels-Illions manufactured carousel, there are 18jumping animals, all but one of which is original; the horse that could not be found in 1975 was replaced with another Dentzel horse. Although the animals were not originally carved to display jewels, at some point they were so displayed at the amusement park, and thus the museum restored the animals on the outside circle with jewels.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} {{crystals}} {{could be used}} as a diffraction grating for X-rays arose in 1912 in a conversation between Paul Peter Ewald and Max von Laue in the English Garden in Munich. Ewald had proposed a resonator model of crystals for his thesis, but this model could not be validated using visible light, since the wavelength was much larger than the spacing between the resonators. Von Laue realized that electromagnetic radiation of a shorter wavelength was needed to observe such small spacings, and suggested that X-rays might have a wavelength comparable to the unit-cell spacing in crystals. Von Laue worked with two technicians, Walter Friedrich and his assistant Paul Knipping, to shine a beam of X-rays through a copper sulfate crystal and record its diffraction on a photographic plate. After being developed, the plate showed a large number of well-defined spots arranged in a pattern of intersecting <b>circles</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> spot produced by the central beam. Von Laue developed a law that connects the scattering angles and the size and orientation of the unit-cell spacings in the crystal, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914.|$|E

25|$|The {{basis for}} {{division}} into zones was the two distinct paths of the heavenly bodies: {{that of the}} stars {{and that of the}} sun and moon. Astronomers know today that the Earth revolving around the sun is tilted on its axis, bringing each hemisphere now closer to the sun, now further away. The Greeks had the opposite model, that the stars and the sun rotated around the earth. The stars moved in fixed <b>circles</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> poles. The sun moved at an oblique angle to the circles, which obliquity brought it now to the north, now to the south. The circle of the sun was the ecliptic. It was the center of a band called the zodiac on which various constellations were located.|$|E
25|$|Dolphins {{are highly}} social animals, often living in pods {{of up to}} a dozen individuals, though pod sizes and {{structures}} vary greatly between species and locations. In places with a high abundance of food, pods can merge temporarily, forming a superpod; such groupings may exceed 1,000 dolphins. Membership in pods is not rigid; interchange is common. Dolphins can, however, establish strong social bonds; they will stay with injured or ill individuals, even helping them to breathe by bringing them to the surface if needed. This altruism {{does not appear to}} be limited to their own species. The dolphin Moko in New Zealand has been observed guiding a female Pygmy Sperm Whale together with her calf out of shallow water where they had stranded several times. They have also been seen protecting swimmers from sharks by swimming <b>circles</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> swimmers or charging the sharks to make them go away.|$|E
25|$|Georg Steinhauser, {{a chemist}} {{writing in the}} journal Medical Hypotheses, said that small pieces of fluff first form in the hair and then {{end up in the}} navel {{at the end of the}} day. He further said that {{abdominal}} hair often seems to grow in concentric <b>circles</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> navel; the scaly structure of the hair enhances the abrasion of minuscule fibres from the shirt and directs the lint towards the belly button. Steinhauser established that shaving one's belly will result in a fluff-free navel but only until the hairs grow back. His other suggestions include wearing old clothes, which tend to shed less lint than newer garments, which can lose up to one-thousandth of their weight to the belly button over the course of a year. A body piercing can also be used, with belly button rings particularly effective at sweeping away fibres before they lodge.|$|E

25|$|Halbertsma had a {{reputation}} of being an erudite man, which he won at a young age. He was especially known as a scholar of the Germanic languages, and {{to the present day}} he is widely acknowledged to have been a larger-than-life figure in the field of linguistics. Shortly after returning to Friesland from his study in Amsterdam, friends from his student years who by then were occupying important posts within the civil service, introduced him to the social <b>circles</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Frisian-minded provincial governor jonker Idsert Aebinga van Humalda. Later in life Halbertsma was acquainted with prominent Dutch literary figures, such as Willem Bilderdijk, and what's more, he maintained a lively correspondence with European greats, like the Danish linguist Rasmus Rask, the English poet Robert Southey, and the German linguist and fairytale-collector Jacob Grimm. Moreover, he was invited to join learned historical and linguistic societies in Leiden, Copenhagen, Berlin, Athens en Halle-Wittenberg.|$|E

25|$|The XF8U-3 first flew on 2 June 1958. Despite {{claims by}} many books and {{articles}} that, during testing, the aircraft reached Mach2.6 at 35,000ft (10,670m), in fact, the maximum speed reached (only once) was Mach 2.39, while normal operating speed {{was no more than}} Mach 2.32. The first time that the aircraft exceeded Mach 2.0 in level flight was on August 14, during its 38th test flight, well before the rival F4H-1 did so. Some sources state that Vought projected a top speed of Mach2.9 with the tail rocket installed, though the windscreen and most aluminum airframes were not designed to withstand the heat of speeds more than Mach 2.35. Demonstrated zoom ceiling was well over 76,000ft (23,170 m). In December 1955, the US Navy declared a competition for a Mach2+ fleet defense interceptor. Fly-offs against the Crusader III's main competitor, the future McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, demonstrated that the Vought design had a definite advantage in maneuverability. John Konrad, Vought's chief test pilot, later stated that the Crusader III could fly <b>circles</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Phantom II. Combat thrust-to-weight ratio (T/W ratio) was almost unity (0.97), while early F4H had only 0.87. However, the solitary pilot in the XF8U-3 was easily overwhelmed with the workload required to fly the intercept and fire Sparrows which required constant radar illumination from the firing aircraft, while the Phantom II had a dedicated radar intercept officer on board.|$|E
