40|$|The Sink - Float {{analysis}} {{is a method}} of investigation of impurities bounded in coal using liquids of different specific gravities. A sample of 0. 5 kg of Maiganga coal was poured into a solution of zinc chloride having different densities of 1. 00, 1. 10, 1. 20, 1. 30, 1. 40, 1. 50, 1. 60, 1. 70, 1. 80, 1. 90 and 2. 00. The floats and sinks {{in each of these}} densities were obtained and used to calculate the <b>cumulative</b> <b>float,</b> <b>cumulative</b> sink, instantaneous ash and distribution of ash; these values were then used to develop the respective partition curves (washability curve) which were obtained by plotting the partition coefficient against the mean of its density range. A sink - float problem was tested using the partition curves obtained. A yield of 80 % was considered where the clean coal contains 16. 45 % ash with rejects of 70. 18 % ash separated at a specific gravity of 1. 7. The separation with a distribution value of 5 % becomes easy according to Burt (2004), Herbst (2005), Mills (2008) and Bird (2001) that if a low value less than 10 % for the distribution is recorded, the separation becomes easy, while a value more than 20 % gives a very difficult separation...|$|R
40|$|Peroral {{floating}} dosage forms {{have up to}} {{now been}} used and prescribed without having achieved any determination of their real floating capabilities versus time. Using a novel in vitro resultant-weight measuring system, the authors present different examples of floating-force kinetics obtained from polymeric matrix floating forms, amongst which several are marketed products and others have undergone in vivo experiments conducted on human volunteers. The <b>floating</b> <b>curves</b> are showing that the bulk density of a dosage form {{is not the most}} appropriate parameter for describing its buoyancy capabilities. These capabilities are, however, perfectly represented and monitored by resultant-weight measurements. Results also indicate that the magnitude of floating strength may vary as a function of time and usually decreases after immersion of the dosage form into the fluid consequently to the evolution of its hydrodynamical equilibrium. To prevent drawbacks of unforeseeable floating capability variations during in vivo studies, the authors suggest optimization of dosage form formulations to be realised with respect to the significance level, the stability and durability of the floating forces produced. © 1990.

50|$|The {{fuselage}} was a flat sided, wooden, cross braced girder structure. This {{carried a}} conventional fin and rudder, plus a rectangular tailplane, mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage, with split elevators. There were two cockpits in tandem, with the pilot seated aft. Both types had long, flat sided <b>floats</b> with <b>curved</b> upper and lower surfaces, the latter with a single step. These were attached to the fuselage with a fore and aft pair of inverted W-form struts, the latter leaf sprung. A similar, though smaller and unstepped third float was mounted on long struts beneath the tail, fitted with a water rudder.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of measurements carried out on plasmas created in five different RF discharge systems. These systems all have two separately powered RF (13. 56 MHz) electrodes, but differ in overall size and in the geometry of both vacuum chambers and RF electrodes or antennae. The two power supplies were synchronized with a phase-shift controller. We investigated the influence of the phase difference between the two RF electrodes on plasma parameters and compared the different system geometries. Single Langmuir probes were used to measure the plasma parameters in a region between the electrodes. Floating potential and ion density were affected by the phase difference and we found a strong influence of the system geometry on the observed phase difference dependence. Both ion density and <b>floating</b> potential <b>curves</b> show asymmetries around maxima and minima. These asymmetries can be explained by a phase dependence of the time evolution of the electrode–wall coupling within an RF-cycle resulting from the asymmetric system geometry. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{single most}} {{distinctive}} style in table tennis is the attacking chopper. While other styles look to attack and gain initiative, the chopper gives up the initiative, uses the chop to return an attack with backspin, making {{it necessary for}} the opponent to start the attack all over again. The defensive chopper returns repeated attacks with slow, floating backspin chops executed as late as possible, taking {{as much time as}} necessary to tire out and frustrate the opponent. Chops can vary in the amount of backspin (from no spin to <b>floating),</b> sidespin (<b>curving</b> into the table or away from the opponent), or position, making it hard to continuously attack. If the opponent refuses to tire out or starts to play defensively, the attacking chopper can suddenly mix in a spin or smash attack, catching anyone who isn't fully alert and prepared. Reversed rubber is usually employed in the forehand, but the backhand is usually reserved for long or short pimples, which is much easier to control. Some players reverse their racket in order to use the pimpled rubber on the forehand, notable examples include Koji Matsushita, Svetlana Ganina, Irina Kotikhina and Viktoria Pavlovich, but some refuse to do that to keep their style simple, including Chen Weixing (Chen does use the inverted rubber on his backhand to attack, occasionally), Joo Se Hyuk, Ding Song, Kim Kyung Ah, Park Mi Young and Tan Paey Fern. Very few players choose to defend with reversed rubber on both sides, a notable example includes Wang Tingting.|$|R

The internal structure of lipid bilayers was described by a one dimensional scattering length density profile (SLDP) model, originally developed {{for the evaluation of}} small angle scattering data. The corresponding model reflectivity curves successfully describe the experimental reflectivity curves of a supported bilayer in the gel phase and a system of a floating bilayer in the liquid crystalline phase. The reflectivity data from the supported bilayer were evaluated individually and served further as an input by the data treatment of <b>floating</b> bilayer reflectivity <b>curves.</b> The results yield internal structure of a deposited and floating bilayer on the level of component groups of lipid molecules.

Each room was thematically unique and covered with sumptuous materials, such as embroidered silks and Tiffany-designed glass tiles. Many of the materials used, including in the leaded-glass windows, light fixtures, mosaics and balustrades. were fabricated at the Tiffany Glass and Decorating Co., and the interiors displayed Tiffany’s “genius as a colorist and a luminist.” Islamic-themed mosaics covered the walls of the front hall. Chinese embroidered silk hangings covered the walls of the reception room. Japanese silk brocade panels were assembled by Coleman from the pieces Havemeyer had bought from the Centennial Exhibition in 1876. These fabric panels adorned the ceiling in H.O. Havemeyer’s library, which was called the Rembrandt Room as it housed his collection of Dutch paintings. In the music room, where the Sunday musicales were held, walls were hung with Chinese embroideries and lit by a magnificent Tiffany-designed chandelier, inspired by the wildflower Queen Anne’s lace and made of clusters of opalescent blown-glass balls. The single most spectacular element of the home was the flying staircase, inspired by that of Venice’s Doge’s Palace. It connected a balcony that circled the upper half of the two-story picture gallery to the room below. Suspended from the ceiling by sparkling chains and fringed with crystal, the stairs <b>floated</b> on a <b>curved</b> piece of cast iron and would tinkle when crossed.

40|$|Background: In many countries, {{financial}} assistance is awarded to physicians who settle {{in an area}} that is designated as a shortage area to prevent unequal accessibility to primary health care. Today, however, policy makers use fairly simple methods to define health care accessibility, with physician-to-population ratios (PPRs) within predefined administrative boundaries being overwhelmingly favoured. Our purpose is to verify whether these simple methods are accurate enough for adequately designating medical shortage areas and explore how these perform relative to more advanced GIS-based methods. Methods: Using a geographical information system (GIS), we conduct a nation-wide study of accessibility to primary care physicians in Belgium using four different methods: PPR, distance to closest physician, <b>cumulative</b> opportunity, and <b>floating</b> catchment area (FCA) methods. Results: The official method used by policy makers in Belgium (calculating PPR per physician zone) offers only a crude representation of health care accessibility, especially because large contiguous areas (physician zones) are considered. We found substantial differences in the number and spatial distribution of medical shortage areas when applying different methods. Conclusions: The assessment of spatial health care accessibility and concomitant policy initiatives are affected by and dependent on the methodology used. The major disadvantage of PPR methods is its aggregated approach, masking subtle local variations. Some simple GIS methods overcome this issue, but have limitations in terms of conceptualisation of physician interaction and distance decay. Conceptually, the enhanced 2 -step floating catchment area (E 2 SFCA) method, an advanced FCA method, was found to be most appropriate for supporting areal health care policies, since this method is able to calculate accessibility at a small scale (e. g. census tracts), takes interaction between physicians into account, and considers distance decay. While at present in health care research methodological differences and modifiable areal unit problems have remained largely overlooked, this manuscript shows that these aspects have a significant influence on the insights obtained. Hence, it is important for policy makers to ascertain to what extent their policy evaluations hold under different scales of analysis and when different methods are used...|$|R
40|$|In This Master s Thesis, {{a bridge}} {{design for the}} {{crossing}} of Bjørnafjorden have been investigated. The design was developed in a cooperation between COWI, Aas Jakobsen, Johs Holte As and Global Maritime, {{as a part of}} The Norwegian Public Roads Administrations (NPRA) project ferry free E 39. The project is still in the early stages, where the feasibility of different bridge designs are being evaluated. The design analyzed in this project is a <b>curved</b> <b>floating</b> bridge, with a cable-stayed section near land in the south end, to allow for ship traffic to pass under the bridge. It is floating freely without moorings, and the curved design help to carry shear forces through membrane stresses. The bridges global strength against ship collisions have been investigated throughout this Thesis. Theoretical background is presented initially, before different analyses are conducted in the software USFOS. An initial suggestion of a bridge model used in the USFOS analyses, were developed by Post. doc Yanyan Sha. During the work with this Master's Thesis, this much time were spent to improve this model, for the analyses to give realistic results, despite the significant number of uncertainties being present in this early stages of the project. An eigenvalue analysis was conducted, and large period deflection modes were observed for horizontal bending of the bridge girder. The maximum eigenvalue was found to be 62. 66 seconds. The results of the eigenvalue analysis were compared with the results obtained by COWI et al., through the software Orcaflex, and were found to correspond well. This gave gave confidence for the mode being able to represent thes structural response of the bridge fairly well. No information were obtained for the damping level of the bridge, and to reduce the uncertainties this would introduce for the final results, a separate damping assessment were performed. An analysis, where the pontoon closest to the navigational channel, was exposed to a ship impact with collision energy of 1250 MJ, was run several times with different damping levels. By comparing the results from these analyses, it was found that even for large changes in the level of damping introduced to the model, the change in the final results were only in the order of a few percent. This is most likely because the most critical response occur shortly after impact, and little energy have had the time to be lost to damping. In the main ship collision analysis three different collision scenarios were investigated, and due to uncertainties with respect to the what collision energies the bridge should be designed against, a range of different collision energies were introduced. In Collision scenario 1, the ship hits the short end of the pontoon closest to the navigational channel. The maximum collision energy of 900 MJ, gives a maximum plastic utilization factor of 0. 905, occurring third cross-beam {{to the north of the}} struck pontoon. Due to difficulties in modeling the pre-tension in the wires of the cable stayed section, false stresses occur due to the permanent loads of the bridge. Because of this, the value of the plastic utilization is not used for the bridge girder of this part of the bridge. Instead, the increase in the plastic utilization is found. For the maximum collision energy, the increase in the plastic utilization is found to have a maximum value of 0. 486, in the girder above the connection to the column of the struck pontoon. From this it is concluded that the bridge will survive the impact, as long as the plastic utilization factor due to the permanent loads do not exceed 0. 5. From the analyses of collision scenario 2, where the pontoon closest to the navigational channel is struck in the transverse direction, very high plastic utilization factors were observed in the column of the struck pontoon. At the top of the column, in the connection to the bridge girder, the plastic utilization factor was found to be 0. 992 for the lowest collision energy investigated of 500 MJ. For the maximum collision energy of 900 MJ, large plastic deformations are observed, and it is thus advised to strengthen the upper part of the pontoon columns. In collision scenario 3, the plastic utilization factors observed, are low, with a maximum value of 0. 763 in one of the cross beams. The global strength of the bridge thus seem to be sufficient for a collision like this, into the bridge girder, and no strengthening are advised. The collision energies used for this collision scenario are much lower than for collision scenario one and two, with a maximum value of 450 MJ. This is a result of it being further away from the navigational channel, and thus was found to be less prone to collisions in the analysis performed by the SSP...|$|R
