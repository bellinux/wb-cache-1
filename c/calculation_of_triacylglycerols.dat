The use of negative ion chemical ionization (NICI) at an ion source block temperature of 300 °C overcomes problems with interpretation of electron ionization (EI) mass spectra produced during the HT-GC/MS. The NICI spectra <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerols</b> produced under these conditions contain abundant [RCO 2]−, [RCO 2 - 18]−, and [RCO 2 - 19]− ions, believed to be produced by nucleophilic gas-phase ammonolysis, {{that are used to}} identify the individual fatty acid moieties associated with peaks in triacylglycerol total ion chromatograms.

40|$|Summary Variations in the {{concentration}} and composition <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerols,</b> {{free fatty acids}} and phospholipids were an-alyzed in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees at five sites. Disks were taken at breast height or at a height of 4 m from the stems of 81 trees differing in diameter and growth rate. The mean concentration <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerols</b> in sapwood was 26 mg g– 1 dry mass; however, variation among trees was large (16 – 51 mg gdm– 1). The concentration <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerols</b> was slightly larger at 4 m height in the stem than at breast height. Concentrations <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerols</b> did not differ between the sapwood of young and small-diameter stems (DBH 36 cm). Concentrations of free fatty acids were negligible in the outer sapwood, but ranged between 5 and 18 mg gdm– 1 in the heartwood. The most abundant fatty acids <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerols</b> were oleic (18 : 1), linoleic (18 : 2 ω 6, 18 : 2 ∆ 5, 9), linolenic (pinolenic, 18 : 3 ∆ 5, 9, 12 and 18 : 3 ω 3) and eicosatrienoic acid (20 : 3 ∆ 5, 11, 14 and 20 : 3 ω 6). The concentration of linoleic acid comprised 39 – 46 % <b>of</b> the <b>triacylglycerol</b> fatty acids and {{the concentration}} was higher in the slow-growing stem from northern Finland than in the stems from southern Finland.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the possibility that the}} apparent inhibition of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) -triacylglycerol secretion by the addition of insulin to rat hepatocyte cultures may result from insulin-mediated enhancement of hepatic lipase secretion and, consequently, <b>of</b> extracellular <b>triacylglycerol</b> hydrolysis. We have, therefore, studied the effects of the inhibitor of lipase activity, Triton WR 1339, on the secretion <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> by cultured rat hepatocytes. Incubation of hepatocyte cultures with increasing concentrations of Triton WR 1339 increased the accumulation of acylglycerol in the medium, suggesting that, in normal incubations, a substantial rate of degradation <b>of</b> secreted <b>triacylglycerol</b> does occur and that it results in an under-estimation of the rate <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> secretion. However, Triton did not counteract the inhibitory effects of insulin, suggesting that the observed increased activity of hepatic lipase induced by the hormone cannot account for the inhibition of acylglycerol accumulation in the medium that occurred in the presence of insulin. BSA increased the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> in culture media by about 2 -fold and also decreased the activity of hepatic lipase by 80 %. A causative relationship between these two effects was supported by the further observation that Triton abolished the effects <b>of</b> BSA on <b>triacylglycerol</b> accumulation in the medium.

Analysis of plasma lipoproteins showed a significant decrease of lipids associated with very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).

40|$|Background Evidence {{from several}} recent {{metabolomic}} studies suggests that increased concentrations <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerols</b> with shorter (14 – 16 carbon atoms), {{saturated fatty acids}} are associated with insulin resistance {{and the risk of}} type 2 diabetes. Although causality cannot be inferred from association studies, patients in whom the primary cause of insulin resistance can be genetically defined offer unique opportunities to address this challenge. Methods We compared metabolite profiles in patients with congenital lipodystrophy or loss-of-function insulin resistance (INSR gene) mutations with healthy controls. Results The absence of significant differences in triacylglycerol species in the INSR group suggest that changes previously observed in epidemiological studies are not purely a consequence of insulin resistance. The presence <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerols</b> with lower carbon numbers and high saturation in patients with lipodystrophy suggests that these metabolite changes may be associated with primary adipose tissue dysfunction. The observed pattern <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> species is indicative of increased de novo lipogenesis in the liver. To test this we investigated the distribution <b>of</b> these <b>triacylglycerols</b> in lipoprotein fractions using size exclusion chromatography prior to mass spectrometry. This associated these triacylglycerols with very low-density lipoprotein particles, and hence release <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerols</b> into the blood from the liver. To test further the hepatic origin <b>of</b> these <b>triacylglycerols</b> we induced de novo lipogenesis in the mouse, comparing ob/ob and wild-type mice on a chow or high fat diet, confirming that de novo lipogenesis induced an increase in relatively shorter, more saturated fatty acids.

HSL−/− mice did not have hypogonadism or adrenal insufficiency. Instead, the testes completely lacked neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (NCEH) activities and contained increased amounts of cholesterol ester. Many epithelial cells in the seminiferous tubules were vacuolated. NCEH activities were completely absent from both brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) in HSL−/− mice. Consistently, adipocytes were significantly enlarged in the BAT (5 -fold) and, to a lesser extent in the WAT (2 -fold), supporting the concept that the hydrolysis <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> was, at least in part, impaired in HSL−/− mice. The BAT mass was increased by 1. 65 -fold, but the WAT mass remained unchanged. Discrepancy of the size differences between cell and tissue suggests the heterogeneity of adipocytes.

40|$|Dietary carbohydrate, {{especially}} fructose, causes hyper-triglyceridaemia {{in humans}} and laboratory animals. The potency of fructose {{in this respect}} is attributed to the ease of its conversion in the liver to the precursors <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol,</b> i. e. sn-glycerol 3 phosphate and fatty acids. This thesis investigates the short-term effects of fructose on lipid metabolism in isolated hepatocytes. Incorporation <b>of</b> fructose into <b>triacylglycerol</b> was much greater than from glucose. The majority of the radioactivity {{was associated with the}} glycerol moiety in each case, although there was a significant incorporation into fatty acids with fructose. The extensive incorporation of fructose into the glycerol moiety {{is the result of the}} ease of its conversion to triose phosphate and of the increase in sn-glycerol 3 phosphate content of the hepatocytes incubated with fructose. The latter effect occurs without a change in the cytoplasmic NADH/NAD ratio. Thus the incorporation <b>of</b> fructose into <b>triacylglycerol</b> is a good measure <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> synthesis; it does not suffer from the disadvantage of the change in cytosolic redox potential observed with glycerol. Increasing fructose concentration caused a stimulation of lipid synthesis from endogenous acyl CoA, an effect also observed when exogenous oleate was added to the hepatocyte which resulted in a much higher level <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> synthesis. Oleate also stimulated glucose incorporation into total lipid but, in contrast to fructose, more phospholipid than triacylglycerol synthesis occurred. This suggested a specific stimulatory effect on triacylglycerol synthesis which was confirmed using oleate as a precursor. The stimulation was attributed to the effect of the ketose on the cytoplasmic sn-glycerol 3 -phosphate content of the cells. Glucagon was found to inhibit the fructose plus oleate stimulation <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> synthesis. Physiological concentrations of fructose also caused increased pogenes is from lactate and acetate, but fatty acid synthesis was substantially inhibited at concentrations of the ketose above 2 mM.

Here we describe successful modifications of terrestrial plant lipid content which increase overall lipid production or shift the balance of lipid production towards lipid varieties more useful for biofuel production. Our discussion ranges from the biosynthetic pathways and rate limiting steps <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> formation to enzymes required for the formation <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> containing exotic lipids. Secondarily, we discuss techniques for genetic engineering and modification of various microalgae which can be combined with insights gained from research in higher plants to aid in the creation of production strains of microalgae. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} {{hypothesis}} that proliferating lymphoid cells in immune-stimulated lymph nodes obtain nutrients locally from adjacent adipose tissue, adult guinea-pigs were fed for six weeks on standard chow or on chow supplemented with 10 % suet, sunflower oil or fish oil. All ate standard chow {{for the last five}} days, during which swelling of one popliteal lymph node was stimulated by repeated local injection of lipopolysaccharide. The fatty acid compositions of phospholipids in both popliteal and in several mesenteric lymph nodes, and <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerols</b> in 11 samples of adipose tissue defined by their anatomical relations to lymph nodes, were determined by gas chromatography. The proportions of fatty acids in the phospholipids extracted from the stimulated popliteal node correlated best with those <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerols</b> in the surrounding adipocytes, less strongly with those of adipocytes elsewhere in depots associated with lymphoid tissue, but not with those of nodeless depots. The composition <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerols</b> in the perinodal adipose tissue may change under local immune stimulation. We conclude that proliferating lymphoid cells in activated lymph nodes obtain fatty acids mainly from the triacylglycerols in adjacent perinodal adipose tissue. Immune stimulation prompts changes in the fatty acid composition <b>of</b> the <b>triacylglycerols</b> <b>of</b> adipocytes in node-containing depots that equip the adipose tissue for provisioning immune responses. Such local interactions show that specialised adipocytes can act as an interface between whole-body and cellular nutrition, and may explain why mammalian adipose tissue is partitioned into a few large and many small depots...|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} the study of the {{regulation}} of the release <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerols</b> by mammary gland slices was developed. By prelabelling the triacylglycerol pool with [3 H]oleate measurements of release of both mass <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> and <b>of</b> newly synthesized <b>triacylglycerol</b> have been made. Oxytocin and ovine prolactin stimulated release <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> and protein, but the former was 40 -fold more effective. Recombinant bovine prolactin was even less active than ovine prolactin, suggesting that contamination of the latter with oxytocin and/or vasopressin was partly responsible for its stimulatory effect on release. The findings support the view that the major effect of oxytocin is to stimulate contraction of myoepithelial cells and thus release secreted lipid stored in the lumen of the mammary gland alveoli. Ionomycin, a Ca 2 + ionophore, also stimulated lipid release, but probably not by the usual apocrine route. Parathyroid hormone-related protein, a peptide produced by the mammary gland, did not stimulate release or antagonize the effects of oxytocin. Release of lipid was also measured in mammary gland slices from late-pregnant, early- and mid-lactating rats and lactating rats made prolactin-deficient. Hormonal stimulation in vitro showed the maturation of response seen in vivo on transition from late pregnancy to peak lactation. Prolactin deficiency resulted in decreased release of newly synthesized lipid in response to oxytocin...|$|R
40|$|Rat hepatocytes in {{monolayer}} culture were preincubated for 19 h with 1 microM-dexamethasone, and the incubation was continued {{for a further}} 23 h with [14 C]oleate, [3 H]glycerol and 1 microM-dexamethasone. Dexamethasone increased the secretion <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> into the medium in particles that had the properties of very-low-density lipoproteins. The increased secretion was matched by {{a decrease in the}} triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine that remained in the hepatocytes. Preincubating the hepatocytes for the total 42 h period with 36 nM-insulin decreased the amount <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> in the medium and in the cells after the final incubation for 23 h with radioactive substrates. However, insulin had no significant effect on the <b>triacylglycerol</b> content <b>of</b> the cell and medium when it was present only in the final 23 h incubation. Insulin antagonized the effects of dexamethasone in stimulating the secretion <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> from the hepatocytes, especially when it was present throughout the total 42 h period. The labelling of lysophosphatidylcholine in the medium when hepatocytes were incubated with [14 C]oleate and [3 H]glycerol was greater than that of phosphatidylcholine. The appearance of this lipid in the medium, unlike that <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> and phosphatidylcholine, was not stimulated by dexamethasone, or inhibited by colchicine. However, the presence of lysophosphatidylcholine in the medium was decreased when the hepatocytes were incubated with both dexamethasone and insulin. These findings are discussed in relation to the control of the synthesis of glycerolipids and the secretion of very-low-density lipoproteins and lysophosphatidylcholine by the liver, particularly in relation to the interactions of glucocorticoids and insulin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Tamoxifen can induce hepatic {{steatosis}} in women. In this study, {{we wanted to}} elucidate the mechanism behind the tamoxifen-induced accumulation <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> in liver in female rats, and we hoped to prevent this development by combination treatment with the modified fatty acid tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA). The increased hepatic triacylglycerol level after tamoxifen treatment was accompanied by decreased acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and FAS activities, increased glycerol- 3 -phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) activity, and a tendency to increased diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) activity. The activities and mRNA levels of enzymes involved in b-oxidation, ketogenesis, and uptake of lipids from liver were unaffected by tamoxifen, whereas the uptake of lipoproteins was unchanged and the uptake of fatty acids was decreased. Combination treatment with tamoxifen and TTA (Tam 1 TTA) normalized the hepatic triacylglycerol level and increased the activities of ACC, FAS, GPAT, and DGAT compared with tamoxifentreated rats. The activities and mRNA levels of enzymes involved in b-oxidation, ketogenesis, and uptake of lipids were increased after Tam 1 TTA treatment. In conclusion, tamoxifen increased the hepatic triacylglycerol level, probably as a result <b>of</b> increased <b>triacylglycerol</b> biosynthesis combined with unchanged b-oxidation. The tamoxifen-induced accumulation <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerol</b> was prevented by cotreatment with TTA, through mechanisms of increased mitochondrial and peroxisomal b-oxidation. —Gudbrandsen, O.

40|$|The {{content of}} the free fatty acids and the fatty acids <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerols</b> has been {{measured}} in human plantar stratum corneum from normal and hyperkeratotic subjects with palmoplantar keratoderma. Fatty acids <b>of</b> <b>triacylglycerols</b> in normal tissues showed a characteristic pattern with a relative abundance of short-chain length and unsaturated fatty acids. Free fatty acid fraction was characterized by the predominance of saturated compounds. The relative amount of short-chain and monoene fatty acids in the hyperkeratotic stratum corneum was increased. These results seem to show a defect in the maturation of fatty acids in the living epidermis and present new evidence that the abnormality of lipid metabolism can influence the process of desquamation in stratum corneum...|$|R
