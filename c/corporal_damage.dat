50|$|In Belgium, {{the medical}} {{advisers}} of sickness funds {{have an important}} role legally in the assessment of working capacity and medical rehabilitation measures for employees whose fitness for work is jeopardized or diminished for health reasons. The measures are laid down in the sickness and invalidity legislation. They are in accordance with the principle of preventing long-term disability. It is apparent from the authors' experience that these measures are not adapted consistently in medical practice. Most of the medical advisers are focusing purely on evaluation of <b>corporal</b> <b>damage,</b> leaving little or no time for rehabilitation efforts. In many other countries, the evaluation of work capacity is done by social security doctors with a comparable task.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{classes are}} able to deal high <b>corporal</b> <b>damage</b> to opponents. Within the game, these classes are {{often referred to as}} 'DPS', which stands for Damage Per Second. There isn't a definitive top DPS class, as damage dealt will depend on numerous factors which vary from one encounter to another (such as the enemy's armor, its positioning, and its magic resistance). Another complication is that while Wizards can readily deal tremendous damage to enemies, their ability to do so is limited by their remaining mana pool, as well as how fast they {{are able to}} regenerate mana. That said, Berserkers, Rogues, and Wizards are three classes most commonly cited as the highest overall damage dealers.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to gain insight into bicycle {{accident}}s. Bicycle accident data and weekly exposure data were prospectively collected for one year to calculate the incidence rate (IR) of bicycle accidents. An accident was included if it occurred during utilitarian cycling, resulting in an acute injury with <b>corporal</b> <b>damage.</b> If an accident occurred, a detailed questionnaire was filled out to collect detailed information about its circumstances and consequences. A sample of 1087 regular (≥ 2 cycling trips to work a week) adult (40 ± 10 years) cyclists was analyzed. Over the 1 -year follow-up period, 20, 107 weeks were covered, accumulating 1, 474, 978 cycled kilometers. Sixty-two participants were involved in 70 bicycle accidents, of which 68 were classified as ‘minor’. The overall IR for the 70 accidents was 0. 324 per 1000 trips (95 % CI 0. 248 – 0. 400), 0. 896 per 1000 h (95 % CI 0. 686 – 1. 106) and 0. 047 per 1000 km (95 % CI 0. 036 – 0. 059) of exposure. Brussels-capital region is the region with the highest IR (0. 086; 95 % CI 0. 054 – 0. 118), with a significantly (P < 0. 05) higher IR compared to Flanders (0. 037; 95 % CI 0. 025 – 0. 050). Injuries were mainly caused by ‘slipping’ (35 %) or ‘collision with a car’ (19 %). The accidents caused abrasions (42 %) and bruises (27 %) to the lower (45 %) and upper limbs (41 %). Police, hospital emergency department or insurance companies were involved in only 7 %, 10 % and 30 % of the cases, respectively. It is noteworthy that 37 % of the participants indicated that they could have avoided the accident. In order to decrease the number of accidents, measures should be taken to keep cycling surfaces clean and decrease the number of obstacles on bicycle infrastructure. Roads and intersections need to be built so that the collisions between cars and bicycles are decreased to a minimum. Car drivers and cyclists should pay more attention towards each other. Under reporting of minor bicycle accidents in Belgium is confirmed, and is higher than expected. Reliable accident statistics, taking into account exposure, are needed to decide which road safety measures are the most effective. The ‘safety in numbers’ principle is also applicable for minor bicycle accidents...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{main goal}} of the thesis is to compare the legal basis of {{compensation}} for <b>corporal</b> <b>damages</b> and compensated types of <b>damages</b> linked to <b>corporal</b> <b>damages</b> in the Czech and French legal systems. It aims not only to evaluate the benefits {{of each of the}} systems for victims but thereof to evaluate the ability of each system to counterbalance on the one hand the opportunity of the judge to consider the circumstances of each individual case and the sums therefore awarded, on the other hand the predictability of decisions for victims, without the excessive formality of the decision. At the end I consider the French legal institutions linked to this issue that could be the source of inspiration for the Czech legal practice. In the first chapter, I compare the theoretical basis of legal responsibility in both chosen legal systems and its influence on legal practices of compensation for <b>corporal</b> <b>damages.</b> These theoretical differences have essential consequences for practices of compensation for <b>corporal</b> <b>damages</b> in both legal systems. An example of this fact are different requirements for proving the causation link or the different role of application of the liability because of things that have essential consequences to victims' status in a case of disputes over compensation for <b>corporal</b> <b>damages.</b> The aim of [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Background: Priapism is a prolonged, {{pathologic}} erection, lasting {{more than}} 4  h. There are 2 main types: ischemic or low-flow priapism and non-ischemic or high-flow priapism. Ischemic type is an emergency. If untreated {{can lead to}} permanent <b>damage,</b> <b>corporal</b> fibrosis and potential erectile disfunction. Color and pulse Doppler can help in the rapid differentiation of {{these two types of}} priapism.|$|R
5000|$|Born in {{the village}} of Havran, he enlisted into the army in April 1909. After serving in the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913, he was {{transferred}} to the forts defending the Mediterranean entrance to the Dardanelles. Following the heavy naval bombardment of the forts guarding the Narrows on 18 March 1915, the gun he was serving in the Mecidiye fort remained operational, but its shell crane had been <b>damaged.</b> <b>Corporal</b> Seyit, by himself, is said to have carried three artillery shells weighing 275 kg. to the 240/35 mm gun and enabled it to continue firing on the Allied Fleet. One of the shells reputedly hit the British pre-dreadnought HMS Ocean, and the ship was later sunk by a mine laid by the minelayer Nusret.|$|R
40|$|Accident {{rates are}} usually {{compiled}} from hospital and police reports. These data are fairly accurate for major and fatal accidents or accidents that include motorized vehicles. However, statistics on minor cycling accidents are incomplete and inaccurate. When {{it comes to}} assessing accident risk, an exposure metric (time or distance cycled) is {{even more difficult to}} determine from existing data. To tackle this problem an online survey was set up in the SHAPES project. First, general and socio-demographic information about the cyclist and the cycling environment were collected with a general questionnaire. During one year, volunteers were asked to fill in a weekly travel diary about their cycling trips and eventual accidents. Major accidents, requiring more than 24 hours of hospitalization, were discarded because there were too few for a sound statistical analysis. Minor accidents that occurred during utilitarian cycling were categorized in 3 groups: 1) all accidents reported including single vehicle incidents and incidents with only material damage; 2) accidents resulting in minor <b>corporal</b> <b>damage</b> (a bruise or a cramp); 3) accidents resulting in acute body injuries. A unique dataset covering almost 1. 5 million kilometres and 20000 travel diaries was collected among 1178 cyclists. On average people cycled 72. 6 km per week at a speed of 17. 7 km/h. With a stepwise multiple linear regression the influence of personal and environmental factors on the weekly cycled distance was studied. Cyclists which have a cycling path along their road to work cycle 43. 3 % (CI: 28. 8 %, 59. 5 %) more per week. The average distance also increases 15. 2 % (CI: 10. 1 %, 20. 4 %) per 10 years of age. Women cycle 23. 1 % (CI: - 31. 2 %, - 14. 1 %) less. Average weekly distance is 32. 2 % (CI: 18. 9 %, 46. 9 %) higher in rural areas. The factors influencing the accident risk were determined with a stepwise multiple Poisson regression. Cycling accidents occur on average every 7266 km in this population of cyclists. Age, gender and urbanisation significantly influence the accident risk. Women report 77 % (CI: 31. 2 %, 137. 4 %) more accidents and cyclists in a rural environment report 31. 8 % (CI: - 8. 7 %, - 49. 2 %) less accidents than in urban environments. An acute body injury occurs on average every 21071 km. Only age influences the injury risk significantly. Older commuter cyclists have fewer accidents (- 5. 3 % per 10 years, CI: - 7. 3 %, - 2. 6 %). This study shows that the availability of a cycling infrastructure may stimulate utilitarian cycling but we cannot rule out self-selection...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade and a half, there has been {{significant}} recognition of the legal rights of children and increasing attention to the law governing those rights. In addition to voluminous law review literature and treatment in texts, the United States Supreme Court, lower federal courts, and the state courts have addressed issues relating to children 2 ̆ 7 s rights in an expanding number of cases. Among the areas that the courts have scrutinized are children 2 ̆ 7 s freedom of expression under the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States, hearing requirements before a student may be suspended from a public school or subjected to a disciplinary transfer, the rights of students summarily expelled from schools to sue for <b>damages,</b> <b>corporal</b> punishment of students, free access by minors to contraceptive devices, the right of a child to secure an abortion without parental consent, and the right of a minor to a hearing before commitment to a state mental hospital. Recently, the focus of attention has shifted to children 2 ̆ 7 s noncriminal misbehavior, which is subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts through statutes proscribing such conduct as truancy, running away from home, incorrigibility, ungovernability or waywardness, leading an idle or dissolute life, or being beyond parental control or habitually disobedient. The courts 2 ̆ 7 exercise of this jurisdiction has been subjected to several lines of attack. Critics charge that statutory definitions of the behavior or circumstances that trigger juvenile court jurisdiction over noncriminal misbehavior of children are hopelessly vague and overbroad, that the exercise of the jurisdiction unconstitutionally punishes a status, that an adjudication under the applicable statutes labels and 2 ̆ 2 stigmatizes 2 ̆ 2 the respondent child, and that exercise of the jurisdiction is an example of racial and economic discrimination. In sum, critics argue that the assertion of jurisdiction by juvenile courts over noncriminal misbehavior of children is not only fraught with constitutional problems, but also fails to serve any legitimate interest of the state and is not a valid exercise of the state 2 ̆ 7 s power. These attacks have culminated in the demand that the jurisdiction be abolished in order that children who engage in conduct that would not be criminal if committed by an adult would be free of the coercive power of the juvenile courts...|$|R
