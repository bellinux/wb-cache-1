Communicating hydrocephalus—in which the normal reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid is blocked and causes increased pressure inside the head—is common in some of the mucopolysaccharidoses.

40|$|<b>Congealing</b> for {{an image}} {{ensemble}} {{is a joint}} alignment process to rectify images in the spatial domain such that the aligned images are as similar {{to each other as}} possible. Fruitful <b>congealing</b> algorithms were applied to various ob-ject classes and medical applications. However, relatively little effort has been taken in the direction of compact and effective feature representations for each image. To remedy this problem, the least-square-based <b>congealing</b> framework is extended by incorporating an unsupervised feature selec-tion algorithm, which substantially removes feature redun-dancy and leads to a more efficient <b>congealing</b> with even higher accuracy. Furthermore, our novel feature selection algorithm itself is an independent contribution. It is not explicitly linked to the <b>congealing</b> algorithm and can be directly applied to other learning tasks. Extensive experi-ments are conducted for both the feature selection and con-gealing algorithms. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we pursue {{the task of}} {{aligning}} an ensemble of images in an unsupervised manner. This task has been {{commonly referred to as}} “congealing ” in literature. A form of <b>congealing,</b> using a least-squares criteria, has been recently demonstrated to have desirable properties over conventional <b>congealing.</b> Least-squares <b>congealing</b> can be viewed {{as an extension of the}} Lucas & Kanade (LK) image alignment algorithm. It is well understood that the alignment performance for the LK algorithm, when aligning a single image with another, is theoretically and empirically equivalent for additive and compositional warps. In this paper we: (i) demonstrate that this equivalence does not hold for the extended case of <b>congealing,</b> (ii) characterize the inherent drawbacks associated with least-squares <b>congealing</b> when dealing with large numbers of images, and (iii) propose a novel method for circumventing these limitations through the application of an inverse-compositional strategy that maintains the attractive properties of the original method while being able to handle very large numbers of images. 1...|$|R

Mawson's Far Eastern Party failed to return, and six men, including Bickerton, remained for an extra winter. On 8 February, just hours after Aurora left Commonwealth Bay after waiting for three weeks, Mawson staggered alone into base, his colleagues Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis and Xavier Mertz dead. As Mawson was being nursed back to health, Bickerton dragged the air-tractor sledge back to base to diagnose the reason for its failure. He found that the freezing conditions had caused the engine oil to <b>congeal,</b> jamming the pistons. He abandoned the sledge at Boat Harbour, next to the base. When Aurora returned to Cape Denison for the final time on 13December 1913, only the engine and propeller were taken back to Australia.|$|E
500|$|Durkheim's {{views on}} crime were a {{departure}} from conventional notions. He believed that crime is [...] "bound up with the fundamental conditions of all social life" [...] and serves a social function. He stated that crime implies [...] "not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes". Examining the trial of Socrates, he argues that [...] "his crime, namely, the independence of his thought, rendered a service not only to humanity but to his country" [...] as [...] "it served to prepare a new morality and faith that the Athenians needed". As such, his crime [...] "was a useful prelude to reforms". In this sense, he saw crime as being able to release certain social tensions and so have a cleansing or purging effect in society. He further stated that [...] "the authority which the moral conscience enjoys must not be excessive; otherwise, no-one would dare to criticize it, and it would too easily <b>congeal</b> into an immutable form.

Rolling Stones reviewer Christian Hoard wrote that the music featured on the album resembled a [...] "new-school Motörhead", with its [...] "scary-clown rap-metal bullshit getting steamrolled by big riffs and speed-punk beats". However, he noted the songs sounded similar to their recorded performances; Hoard called it the [...] "songs' samey-ness". Adrien Begrand of PopMatters called 9.0: Live a [...] "very worthy live album", and complimented the band for gaining success the [...] "old-fashioned way, building a strong reputation as an extremely potent live act". Begrand noted the band's relationship with their [...] "extremely devoted fans" [...] as a strong point, and that the band's fans are [...] "arguably the most fervently loyal bunch {{since the early days}} of Metallica two decades ago". However, he complained that it was distracting to have the band perform in a variety of undisclosed locations, rather than the one set throughout. [...] Tom Day of musicOMH wrote that the song [...] "Before I Forget" [...] is a [...] "true gem and grinds out with a level of devastation that will make you green with envy if you weren't at these shows", and [...] that drummer Joey Jordison took [...] "centre stage" [...] throughout the performance. Blair Fischer of the Chicago Tribune gave the album [...] "three volume levels", writing, [...] "The most amazing feat is that nine genetic defectives can <b>congeal</b> for such synchronous brain-damaged fury". Billboard reviewer Christa Titus wrote that Slipknot was [...] "relentless in its delivery" [...] of their live performances, calling the album [...] "an overwhelming frenzy of sound and fury".

Lin was praised for his ability to facilitate the offense, something the Knicks had struggled to do for the first 23 games of the season. Lin, exceeding expectations, was named the starter for the Knicks following a game against the Utah Jazz. Lin guided the Knicks to a seven-game winning streak, despite being without Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire for five games due to a groin injury and a death in the family respectively, that brought the team back to a [...]500 winning percentage. The surge of positive play by the Knicks accompanied by the performance of Lin caused extensive national and worldwide media coverage that was referred to as 'Linsanity'. To bolster their depth and perimeter shooting percentage, the Knicks signed J. R. Smith on February 18, 2012.

An urgency of this scientific work is substantiated, based on overviewed studies into the processes of cutting and ripping of different <b>congealed</b> materials. It is found that the wear rate of multiblade tool substantially increases the consumed power of technological machines, energy capacity and cost of technological processes of cutting and ripping the <b>congealed</b> media. Therefore, to reduce the energy expenses of technological machines, energy capacity and costs of technological processes of cutting and ripping the <b>congealed</b> media, {{it is necessary to}} create a method for calculating limiting loads on multiblade cutting tools and determine tool life until limiting wear, as applied to exploiting the drilling-ripping machines, designed for ripping the <b>congealed</b> coal in winter period. Trigonometric transforms were used to derive formulas for calculating the constituent resistance forces to cutting, which act on the wear area of cutting tool and on leading surface of cutting. These formulas account for the index of wear rate with respect to height of cutting tool, related to geometric parameters of cutting tool of BRM- 80 / 110 drilling-ripping machine...|$|R
