2500|$|It {{is often}} {{sold as a}} salt {{in the form of}} either <b>codeine</b> <b>sulfate</b> or codeine {{phosphate}} in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. Codeine hydrochloride is more common worldwide and the citrate, hydroiodide, hydrobromide, tartrate, and other salts are also seen. The chemical name for codeine is Morphinan-6-ol, 7,8-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-3-methoxy-17-methyl-, (5α,6α)- ...|$|E
40|$|DERMAL REACTIVITY TO INTRADERMAL INJECTION OF THE NON-ADRENERGIC, NON-CHOLINERGIC NEUROPEPTIDE, SUBSTANCE P, WAS STUDIED IN 12 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC URTICARIA AND 6 HEALTHY CONTROLS. REACTIVITY WAS EXAMINED AT THREE 10 -FOLD GREATER CONCENTRATIONS OF SUBSTANCE P, AND RESULTS WERE COMPARED TO SERIAL DILUTIONS OF <b>CODEINE</b> <b>SULFATE.</b> BOTH SUBSTANCES CAUSED A WHEAL REACTION MAXIMAL AT 15 - 20 MINUTES AFTER INJECTION. THE FLARE REACTION TO CODEINE WAS MAXIMAL AT 15 - 20 MINUTESAND TO SUBSTANCE P AT 5 MINUTES AFTER INJECTION. REACTIVITY TO SUBSTANCE P WAS NOT STATISTICALLY DIFFERENT IN CHRONIC URTICARIA COMPARED TO CONTROLS. HOWEVER, PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC URTICARIA TENDED TO HAVE CONSISTENTLY GREATER SKIN REACTIVITY AS ASSESSED BY WHEAL SIZE, TO <b>CODEINE</b> <b>SULFATE.</b> FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CLARIFY THE REACTIVITY TO SUBSTANCE P IN DIFFERENT SUBGROUPS OF CHRONIC URTICARIA. ...|$|E
40|$|During the {{investigation}} of some new substi-tuted pyridine derivatives (Gray et a!., 1959 a, b), the preliminary findings indicated the presence of analgesic activity as well as considerable muscle relaxant action. In view of the interest in, and need for, non-narcotic agents with moderate analgesic potency and of the potential value of a drug with both analgesic and muscle relaxant properties, evaluation of this series was extended with emphasis on analgesic and muscle relaxant effects. In the evaluation of these new derivatives, <b>codeine</b> <b>sulfate,</b> dextro propoxyphene hydro-chloride and mephenesin were tested concur-rently in order to compare their effects unde...|$|E
50|$|Since 6-MAM is {{a unique}} {{metabolite}} to heroin, its presence in the urine confirms that heroin was the opioid used. This is significant because on a urine immunoassay drug screen, the test typically tests for morphine, which is a metabolite {{of a number of}} legal and illegal opiates/opioids such as <b>codeine,</b> morphine <b>sulfate,</b> and heroin. Trace amounts of 6-MAM, a specific metabolite of heroin, are also excreted for approximately 6-8 hours following heroin use. so a urine specimen must be collected soon after the last heroin use, however, the presence of 6-MAM suggests that heroin was used as recently as within the last day. 6-MAM is naturally found in the brain of certain mammals.|$|R
40|$|Preparation, {{characterization}} and {{in vitro}} release studies of <b>codeine</b> from xanthan/chondroitin <b>sulfate</b> (X/CS) hydrogels prepared through a crosslinking technique are reported. Swelling and drug delivery studies {{were conducted in}} phosphate buffer solution (pH= 7. 4) which simulates the pH of the intestinal fluid, at 37 °C. The in vitro release test revealed {{that the percentage of}} codeine released in phosphate buffer solution increases with increasing the amount of chondroitin sulfate in the composition of hydrogels. The drug release behaviour of the hydrogels loaded with codeine fitted well with case II transport mechanism for all formulations. The biocompatibility testing was made by hemolisys (plasma hemoglobin) technique...|$|R
40|$|This {{analytical}} method for easier determination of codeine in human plasma {{is based on}} “high-performance ” liquid chromatography for separation and the natural fluores-cence of codeine for detection. Codeine is extracted from alkalinized plasma {{with a mixture of}} hexane and dichlo-romethane, and the extract is further purified and chro-matographed. The method can be used for routine assay of codeine at the concentrations of 10 rg/L or greater in human plasma. As little as 4 JLg/L can be detected. Coefficients of variation for the assay of codeine in the concentration range of 10 to 100 tg/L were 2. 2 - 7. 4 % (n = 6). We used this method to establish a concentration/ time profile for plasma from a human volunteer after a 60 -mg oral dose of <b>codeine</b> <b>sulfate.</b> AddItIonal Keyphrases: drug assay- drug bioa vail...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the antinociceptive effects of several opiate and nonopiate analgesics in the rhesus monkey using a discrete tr shock titraon paradigm. Morphine sultate (1, 5 and 1 0 mg/ kg i. m.) and <b>codeine</b> <b>sulfate</b> (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg i. m.) produced {{a significant and}} dose-dependent increase in mean shock thresh-old that was not accompanied by {{a significant increase in}} mean response latency. The mean number of shocks terminated was significantly decreased at the highest dose of each opiate. Aspirin (100 and 300 mg/kg p. o.) or ibuprofen (200 mg/kg p. o.) did not significantly increase mean shock threshold or mean response latency or decrease mean number of shocks terminated. How-ever, 6 mg/kg i. m. of 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydroisoxazolo [5, 4 -c]pyridin- 3 -ol produced a significant increase in mean shock threshold and mean response tency with no significant effect on mean number of shocks terminated. The absence of any effects of a 2 -mg/kg dose of 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydroisoxazolo(5, 4 -c]pyridin- 3 -oI and the severe side effects produced by 1 0 mg/kg prevented determi-nation of its dose-response relationship. Diazepam (0. 5, 2 and 8 mg/kg i. m.) produced a significant, dose-dependent increase in mean shock threshold and a significant increase in mean re-sponse latency with no consistent or signfficant effect on mean number of shocks terminated. Doses of 2 and 8 mg/kg of diazepam also produced signs of ataxia. These resufts suggest that the discrete tr shock titration paradm is suftable for demonstration of the antinociceptive effects of opiate and certain nonopiate analgesics, but not nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory an-algesics in the rhesus monkey. The discrete trial shock titration paradigm has been used by several investigators to evaluate the antinociceptive activity of compounds in primates (Yaksh and Rudy, 1977; Dykstra an...|$|E
