5|$|Yang expresses {{difficulty}} {{connecting with}} the children on pediatrics, to Robbins' disappointment. Tom becomes frightened when he notices Lexie is not wearing a name tag, so she attacks her and runs away. His mother is subsequently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which requires surgery, and Tom falls down the stairs, for which also requires surgery. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) returns to the hospital, and informs Robbins that Yang is just sucking up. The Crawley's are uneasy about agreeing to surgery, but Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) convinces them {{that it is the}} right thing to do. An obstetrics and gynecology resident accidentally cuts off a baby's arm during a <b>caesarian</b> <b>section,</b> but it is healed by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Robbins, and Yang. Stevens assists Shepherd with a five-hour craniotomy, and Karev is fearful that she cannot handle it, although she is ultimately able to complete the surgery. At the conclusion of the episode, human resources sends out an email notifying Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback) and Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul)'s wife Megan (Molly Kidder), that they have been fired.|$|E
5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including <b>caesarian</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E

25|$|A normal dose {{of sodium}} thiopental (usually 4–6mg/kg) {{given to a}} {{pregnant}} woman for operative delivery (<b>caesarian</b> <b>section)</b> rapidly makes her unconscious, but the baby in her uterus remains conscious. However, larger or repeated doses can depress the baby.|$|E
25|$|Pre-eclampsia is also {{associated}} with increased frequency of <b>Caesarian</b> <b>section,</b> preterm delivery, and placental abruption.

40|$|BackgroundAbdominal wall free flaps {{are used}} most {{frequently}} in autologous breast reconstruction, and these flaps require intact and robust deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) vessels. Pfannenstiel incisions are often present during preoperative visits for breast reconstruction and could potentially signal compromised blood {{supply to the}} lower abdominal wall. In this study, we compared the number of DIEP vessels between patients with and without Pfannenstiel incisions undergoing autologous breast reconstruction. MethodsA retrospective review of medical records was performed for patients with (study) and without (control) Pfannelstiel incisions (n= 34 for each group) between June 2010 and July 2013. In addition to patient demographics, number of <b>caesarian</b> <b>sections,</b> and outcomes of free flap reconstruction, abdominal wall vasculature was compared using the preoperative computed tomography angiographic data between the groups. For each patient, vessels measuring greater than 1 mm were counted and divided into four sections of the lower abdominal wall. ResultsThe mean number of perforator vessels was 10. 6 in the study group and 11. 4 in the control group, which was not statistically different (P= 0. 575). Pfannenstiel incisions with history of repeat <b>caesarian</b> <b>sections</b> were not associated with decreased number of perforator vessels. ConclusionsPfannenstiel scars are associated with neither {{a change in the}} number of DIEP vessels nor decreased viability of a free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous and DIEP flap. Lower abdominal free flaps based on DIEP vessels appear safe even in patients who have had multiple <b>caesarian</b> <b>sections</b> through Pfannenstiel incisions...|$|R

25|$|Patient B is a {{woman who}} gave birth by <b>caesarian</b> <b>section.</b> Her {{physician}} prescribed codeine for post-caesarian pain. She took the standard prescribed dose, however experienced nausea and dizziness while she was taking codeine. She also noticed that her breastfed infant was lethargic and feeding poorly. When the patient mentioned these symptoms to her physician, they recommended that she discontinue codeine use. Within a few days, both the patient and her infant’s symptoms were no longer present. It is assumed that if the patient underwent a pharmacogenomic test, it would have revealed she may have had a duplication of the gene CYP2D6 placing her in the Ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM) category, explaining her ADRs to codeine use.|$|E

50|$|Being upright during labour {{and birth}} can {{increase}} the available space within the pelvis by 28-30% giving more room to the baby for rotation and descent.

They are also associated with the lower need for epidural.|$|R
25|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} pre-eclampsia is {{the delivery of}} the baby and placenta. The timing of delivery should balance the desire for optimal outcomes for the baby while reducing risks for the mother. The severity of disease and the maturity of the baby are primary considerations. These considerations are situation-specific and management will vary with situation, location, and institution. Treatment can range from expectant management to expedited delivery by induction of labor or <b>Caesarian</b> <b>section,</b> in addition to medications. Important in management is {{the assessment of the}} mothers organ systems, management of severe hypertension, and prevention and treatment of eclamptic seizures. Separate interventions directed at the baby may also be necessary. Bed rest has not been found to be useful and is thus not routinely recommended.|$|E
500|$|For {{women with}} {{injuries}} above T6, a risk during labor and delivery that threatens {{both mother and}} fetus is autonomic dysreflexia, in which the blood pressure increases to dangerous levels high enough to cause potentially deadly stroke. Drugs such as nifedipine and captopril {{can be used to}} manage an episode if it occurs, and epidural anesthesia helps although it is not very reliable in women with SCI. [...] Anesthesia is used for labor and delivery even for women without sensation, who may only experience contractions as abdominal discomfort, increased spasticity, and episodes of autonomic dysreflexia. Reduced sensation in the pelvic area means women with SCI usually have less painful delivery; in fact, they may fail to realize when they go into labor. If there are deformities in the pelvis or spine <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> may be necessary. Babies of women with SCI {{are more likely to be}} born prematurely, and, premature or not, they are more likely to be small for their gestational time.|$|E

2500|$|Maimonides {{explained}} the laws governing the redemption of a firstborn son ( [...] , pidyon haben) in [...] Maimonides taught {{that it is}} a positive commandment for every Jewish man to redeem his son who is the firstborn of a Jewish mother, as [...] says, [...] "All first issues of the womb are mine," [...] and [...] says, [...] "And you shall surely redeem a firstborn man." [...] Maimonides taught that a mother is not obligated to redeem her son. If a father fails to redeem his son, when the son comes of age, he is obligated to redeem himself. If it is necessary for a man to redeem both himself and his son, he should redeem himself first and then his son. If he only has enough money for one redemption, he should redeem himself. A person who redeems his son recites the blessing: [...] "Blessed are You [...] [...] [...] who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the redemption of a son." [...] Afterwards, he recites the shehecheyanu blessing and then gives the redemption money to the Cohen. If a man redeems himself, he should recite the blessing: [...] "Blessed [...] [...] [...] who commanded us to redeem the firstborn" [...] and he should recite the shehecheyanu blessing. The father may pay the redemption in silver or in movable property that has financial worth like that of silver coins. If the Cohen desires to return the redemption to the father, he may. The father should not, however, give it to the Cohen with the intent that he return it. The father must give it to the Cohen with the resolution that he is giving him a present without any reservations. Cohens and Levites are exempt from the redemption of their firstborn, as they served as the redemption of the Israelites' firstborn in the desert.
