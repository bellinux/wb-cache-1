While playing back the tapes of a recent session of play, software can generate a scatter plot of the amount bet versus the count {{at the time the}} bet was made and find the trendline that best fits the scattered points. If the player is not counting cards, there will be no trend; his bet variation and the <b>count</b> <b>variation</b> will not consistently correlate. If the player is counting and varying bets according to the count, there will be a trend whose slope reflects the player's average edge from this technique.|$|E

Twist and <b>Count</b> <b>variation</b> in a yarn can have considerable {{effect on the}} appearance of the finished fabric, whether woven or knitted. The variability in the strength of a yarn is important in fabric formation. Variation in strength is related to variation of weight per unit length. In this project, an attempt has been made to establish National Norms for Twist and Strength Variation of Cotton Yarn produced in Sri Lanka. The short-term variability of twist is determined very largely by the variation in weight per unit length.

However, the variations in fibre cross-sectional areas are calculated from between-fibre diameter variations only, without considering the within-fibre diameter variations. Wool fibres exhibit diameter variations both between fibres and within fibres. Ignoring the within-fibre diameter variations may lead to an underestimation of yarn limiting irregularity. This paper reports an improved model for calculating the limiting irregularity of wool yarn, incorporating both between-fibre and within-fibre diameter variations of the constituent wool fibres. Experimental verification shows that this model can predict yarn limiting irregularity more accurately than the existing one. Based on this improved yarn limiting irregularity model, an improved effective fineness model which also incorporates both within-fibre and between-fibre diameter variations has been established...|$|E

Accordingly, programmed active search for human cases, annual coproscopic surveys and treatment of infected cases were started in 1998, aiming at producing a sharp prevalence rate drop by the year 2000.

40|$|A {{class of}} {{strategies}} {{has been proposed}} to reduce contrail formation in the United States airspace. A 3 D grid based on weather data and the cruising altitude level of aircraft is adjusted to avoid the persistent contrail potential area with the consideration to fuel-efficiency. In this paper, the authors introduce a contrail avoidance strategy on 3 D grid by considering additional operationally feasible constraints from an air traffic controller's aspect. First, shifting too many aircraft to the same cruising level will make the miles-in-trail at this level smaller than the safety separation threshold. Furthermore, the high density of aircraft at one cruising level may exceed the workload for the traffic controller. Therefore, in our new model we restrict the number of total aircraft at each level. Second, the aircraft <b>count</b> <b>variation</b> for successive intervals cannot be too drastic since the workload to manage climbing/descending aircraft is much larger than managing cruising aircraft. The contrail reduction is formulated as an integer-programming problem {{and the problem is}} shown to have the property of total unimodularity.

The variance component analysis that we explore here is a first step towards understanding the sources and nature of the RNA-Seq <b>count</b> <b>variation.</b> When using a numerical measure to identify stably expressed genes, the outcome depends on multiple factors: the background sample set and the reference gene set used for count normalization, the technology used for measuring gene expression, and the specific numerical stability measure used.

Such behaviour can be understood on the basis of LSDA+U calculations, which yield invariably non-magnetic Pu state due to the proximity to the 5 f 6 state. It is also shown that the ground-state density of states should not be directly compared with photoelectron spectra, because the spectral density obtained from Hubbard-I calculations is in the narrow band regime of Pu dramatically different than the underlying density of states.
