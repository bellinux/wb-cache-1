5|$|The Uniforms of the Confederate States {{military}} forces were the uniforms {{used by the}} Confederate Army and Navy during the American Civil War, from 1861 to 1865. The uniform initially varied greatly due {{to a variety of}} reasons, such as location, limitations on the supply of cloth and other materials, State regulations that were different from the standard regulations, and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> during the war.|$|E
5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the canals}} were {{owned by the}} London and North Western Railway, {{restrictions}} were imposed on what they could carry, and the canals failed to make sufficient money to cover the interest on mortgages. However, they made a substantial operating profit for some years. Around 1850, the average annual income was £104,638, which yielded a surplus of £45,885. Most of the income was from carrying, and by 1870, income had risen to £143,976, although this only yielded a surplus of £11,727. Total traffic was 855,462 tons in 1858, but this had dropped to 742,315 tons in 1868. The carrying business was expanded in the 1870s, but although turnover increased, operating profits fell dramatically, to just £1,568 in 1876. By 1905, total traffic was 469,950 tons, nearly all of it in boats owned by the company, and between the 1870s and {{the onset of the}} First World War the company sometimes made a small operating profit and sometimes a loss. Following the end of the war, working hours were cut, wages increased, and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> increased. Losses escalated, to £153,318 on an income of £227,845 in 1920, and carriage by the company ceased in 1921, in an attempt to reduce losses. 433,230 tons of goods carried in 1929 had dropped to 151,144 tons in 1940, by which time income from tolls was £17,763, and total income was £40,985.|$|E

25|$|Since 2004, {{the large}} number of orders {{increased}} demand for shipyard slots, raising their price and increasing ship costs. The per-ton construction cost of an LNG liquefaction plant fell steadily from the 1970s through the 1990s. The cost reduced by approximately 35 percent. However, recently the cost of building liquefaction and regasification terminals doubled due to increased <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> and a shortage of skilled labor, professional engineers, designers, managers and other white-collar professionals.|$|E

25|$|Although the coin's {{abolition}} {{has been}} proposed because it is now worth very little, there are currently no firm plans to eliminate the penny. As of 2015, based on the U.S. Mint Annual Report released for 2014, it costs the U.S. Mint 1.67 cents (down from 2.41 cents in 2011 and 1.83 cents in 2013) to make one cent because of the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> production, and distribution. This figure includes the Mint's fixed components for distribution and fabrication, as well as Mint overhead allocated to the penny. Fixed costs and overhead {{would have to be}} absorbed by other circulating coins without the penny. The loss from producing the one cent coin in the United States for the year of 2013 was $55,000,000. This was a slight decrease from 2012, the year before, which had a production loss of $58,000,000.|$|E
25|$|On December 10, 2004, the governor's office {{announced}} that the signature span concept had been scrapped, with the bridge to be the simple viaduct originally proposed. The design, having gone full circle, remained expensive due to the continued high <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials.</b> Many argued {{that there would be}} little difference in final cost with this lesser proposal since that concept required obtaining new permits, perhaps adding another two or three years; furthermore, a viaduct may not even be able to obtain Coast Guard approval, since the maximum width of the ship channel would be reduced by almost half. Local reaction to this announcement was intense, with most suggesting that the bridge be built to appear as proposed— either in the steel material as bid or using a reinforced concrete tower of similar appearance but of lower cost.|$|E
25|$|Labour costs rose {{considerably}} {{during the}} latter part of the war, and a further wage award by the Committee on Production, together with increased <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> made it necessary to consider further fare increases. The first scheme in March consisted of children’s fares being made half adult fares and an alteration to ordinary stages, with no alteration to workmen’s fares; this scheme was amended in April to revert to the old stages, with children’s fares fixed at half the adult fare, with a 1d. minimum fare rising to 1½d. over a 2½d. and 3d. adult stage, and to 2d. over a 3½d. and 4d. stage. Ordinary fares of 1d. and 1½d. were increased by ½d. and all fares of 2d. and over were increased by 1d., the 1½d. minimum taking effect from Sunday 14 April.|$|E

25|$|Rural areas lacked {{access to}} safe water {{supplies}} {{in the event}} of an epidemic of waterborne diseases. Water came primarily from large earthen tanks, rivers and tube wells. In the dry season, partially drained tanks became yet another hospitable breeding area for malaria vector mosquitoes. Tank and river water, moreover, are readily susceptible to contamination by cholera; tube wells are much safer in this respect. However, landlords were often reluctant to sink tube wells for economic reasons, even when credit was extended for this purpose, and as many as one-third of the existing wells in war-time Bengal were in disrepair due to government inefficiency and the high <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials.</b> The national government urged an initiative to repair these wells in November 1943, but actual work was not begun until after the cholera epidemic had subsided.|$|E
500|$|When {{he started}} classes with this [...] "homemade" [...] knife, his {{instructors}} and fellow students {{were impressed with}} his handiwork {{and asked him to}} make knives for them. Emerson did so and sold these early butterfly knives for just the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> but he soon raised the price to $50 each, as demand for his knives increased. Emerson went on to make fixed-blade knives on a part-time basis, but upon seeing a Michael Walker handmade folding knife at a gun show, he was so impressed by the quality and design that he decided {{he was going to make}} folding pocketknives from that point on. Emerson contacted Walker and obtained his permission to use the Walker Linerlock mechanism on his own knives. [...] According to a 1990 article by Paul Basch, Emerson said of Walker, [...] "Here was a guy who put everything I was looking for into a knife. It was then I decided to start making knives seriously and locking liners in particular".|$|E
500|$|Bowmar Instrument Corporation {{introduced}} the [...] "Bowmar Brain", a four-function pocket calculator, in September 1971 and the $179 calculator sold over 500,000 copies {{in the first}} year. Bowmar then developed the [...] "901B" [...] calculator that was priced at $120. In September 1972, Texas Instruments (TI) {{introduced the}} TI-2500 portable four-function calculator that also sold for $120. The 901B and the TI-2500 both used the TI TMS0100 family of [...] "calculator-on-a-chip" [...] integrated circuit. TI was now directly competing with their IC customers. Other semiconductor companies such as National Semiconductor and Rockwell began selling calculators. Commodore Business Machines and other office equipment companies also got into the market. A frenzied price war started. By early 1974, Ed Roberts found he could purchase a calculator in a retail store for less than his <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials.</b> The larger companies could sell below cost to win market share. Bowmar lost $20 million in 1974 and filed for bankruptcy. Commodore acquired their IC supplier, MOS Technology. Texas Instruments won the price war but their calculator division lost $16 million in 1975.|$|E

500|$|Had it {{not been}} for Woodham Brothers' {{scrapyard}} in Barry, South Wales, no rebuilt Light Pacifics would have been preserved. Twenty still exist, in varying states of preservation: [...] two were purchased directly from BR for preservation, 34023 Blackmoor Vale & 34051 Winston Churchill; the other eighteen were purchased from Barry Scrapyard. Of these twenty class members to survive, ten are in original form, whilst ten are in [...] "rebuilt" [...] form. Eleven of the surviving engines are named after west country locations in the south of England and the remaining nine after RAF Squadrons or significant persons, including Prime Minister Winston Churchill. All but one of the class in preservation were built at Brighton Works, the exception being 34101 Hartland which was built at Eastleigh Works. The class has proved to be useful for preservation societies due to its good route availability and ample power, with some having returned to the main line to haul special trains. It is uncertain whether all of the preserved locomotives will be restored to working order, owing to the very poor condition some of them were in when purchased and the increasing <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|E
