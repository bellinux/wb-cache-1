So it was really about that moment of <b>choice</b> <b>and</b> the <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> acceptance between these two great warriors, rather than the actual detail of his actual death. That was actually a tonal choice as to how we saw that character." ...|$|R
50|$|Evidence {{shows that}} cash {{can be more}} transparent, more accountable, more cost effective, help support local markets and economies, and {{increase}} financial inclusion and give people more <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> <b>choice.</b> Sending cash is cheaper as {{it does not have}} the same transaction costs as shipping goods. Sending cash is also faster than shipping the goods. In 2009 for sub-Saharan Africa, food bought locally by the WFP cost 34 percent less and arrived 100 days faster than food sent from the United States, where buying food from the United States is required by law. Cash aid also helps local food producers, usually the poorest in their countries, while imported food may damage their livelihoods and risk continuing hunger in the future.|$|R
5000|$|In {{recent years}} the term patient {{participation}} {{has been used in}} many different contexts. Participatory medicine, health consumerism and patient-centered care. For the latter context, i.e. patient-centered care, a more nuanced definition was proposed in 2009 {{by the president of the}} Institute for Healthcare Improvement Donald Berwick: [...] "The experience (to the extent the informed, individual patient desires it) of transparency, individualization, recognition, respect, <b>dignity,</b> <b>and</b> <b>choice</b> in all matters, without exception, related to one's person, circumstances, and relationships in health care" [...] are concepts closely related to patient participation. In the UK over the course of 2016 two new relevant terms have expanded in usage: Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) and Engagement (PPIE) in the sense of the older term coproduction (public services).|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Concern for {{the grieving}} family can {{moderate}} {{the intentions of}} critical care staff to advocate deceased organ and tissue donation. Conversely, benevolent actions may provoke distress through missed opportunities to save or transform lives. This article provides insight into the perceived benefits of organ and tissue donation for grieving families who experienced end-of-life care {{in the intensive care}} unit. METHODS: Data were collected via semistructured, face-to-face or telephone interviews with 43 participants from 31 donor families. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and subjected to qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The study findings affirmed the importance of person-centered end-of-life care. Donor families shared examples of good-quality care and communication that contained the hallmarks of compassion, respect, <b>dignity,</b> <b>and</b> <b>choice.</b> We uncovered a trajectory of hope and despair in which the option of organ and tissue donation appeared to give meaning to {{the life and death of}} the deceased person and was comforting to some families in their bereavement. CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings underlined the significance of donation decision making for grieving families. Organ and tissue donation has the potential to balance hope and despair at the end of life when the wishes of the dying, deceased, and bereaved are fulfilled...|$|R
40|$|Care {{practices}} in long-term care facilities have typically been {{guided by the}} biomedical approach to care. In the past two decades, {{there has been a}} growing movement in transforming care for residents from a medical model to a person-centered model in long-term care. This capstone project reviews and synthesizes current literature on person-centered care, with a focus on care practices and organizational issues. An extensive literature review was conducted using databases such as Ageline, PsychINFO, Medline, Google Scholar, CINAHL and the Simon Fraser University library catalogue. A total of 69 articles that addressed the research questions were identified and incorporated in this review. Empirical evidence indicates that implementing person-centered care practices that honor the <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> <b>choice</b> of residents, strengthen resident and care staff relationships and utilize nonpharmacological care to preserve the personhood of residents can improve the caring experience. In addition, there is evidence that person-centered care can improve the well-being and quality of life of residents and improve job satisfaction for care providers. This paper also examines the organizational facilitators such as culture change, staff training and management’s role, and environmental design as well as the organizational barriers in implementing person-centered care...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{concepts}} of independence and care are often interpreted differently and more restrictively for older adults. Services are typically more concerned with issues of safety than with enabling participation or inclusion. Whilst the rhetoric of housing and care for older adults tends to be underpinned by ideas about independence, privacy, <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> <b>choice,</b> {{there appears to be a}} paradox between these concepts and the goals of regulatory policy with its emphasis on safety, performance, and monitoring. Care homes exemplify this paradox where an imperative for ‘homely values’ contrasts with the application of safety regulation designed to protect people ‘at work’ from harm. This study offers a new and original qualitative data set providing an empirically grounded and context based understanding of how important social and regulatory policy has been translated into local policy, applied by staff and ultimately experienced by residents. The research design comprises qualitative semi-structured interviews, observation and the evaluation of documentary sources positioned within an eight care home case study framework. The primary sources of data are care home inspection reports and semi-structured qualitative interviews with residents, staff and home managers. The analytical framework includes thematic analysis within a system oriented Grid and Group typology designed to elucidate how the different case study homes apply regulation, interpret risk, and subsequently how this shapes participant experience...|$|R

40|$|Background There now exist a {{range of}} efficacious options for the {{treatment}} of psychosis in mental healthcare. The importance of recovery, empowerment, <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> <b>choice</b> among patients with severe mental health diagnoses are important topics in contemporary research and practice. This thesis presents a meta-analytic review followed by a randomised controlled experimental study. These address distinct but related questions which aim to further our understanding of the choices available for intervention in psychosis and whether intervention may improve the ability of psychosis patients to make those choices. Aims The first objective aimed to offer a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of social skills training (SST), which is a psychological intervention for psychosis. SST has fallen out of favour in the UK and is not widely implemented in practice. We hypothesised that SST would demonstrate superiority for the negative symptoms of psychosis. The second objective was to determine whether decision-making capacity regarding treatment among psychosis patients could be improved by the application of a brief psycho-educational intervention targeting the jumping-to-conclusions (JTC) bias, which is a commonly observed cognitive bias in psychosis. We hypothesised that the intervention would improve decision-making capacity. Methods Firstly, a series of 70 meta-analyses are presented in a systematic review assessing the efficacy of social skills training across a number of psychosis outcome domains: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, general symptoms, overall symptoms and social functioning outcomes. Secondly, a randomised controlled experimental study is presented in which 36 psychosis patients in NHS Lanarkshire and 1 in NHS Dumfries & Galloway were allocated to receive either a brief meta-cognitive training (MCT) intervention or an non-specific control presentation lecture. Capacity was assessed at baseline and post-treatment while the impact of the intervention upon capacity was estimated by ANCOVA. Mediation analyses assessed whether changes in the JTC bias mediated outcome. Findings In the meta-analytic review, SST demonstrated superiority over treatment as usual (TAU. g= 0. 3), active controls (g= 0. 2 - 0. 3) and comparators pooled (g= 0. 2 - 0. 3) for negative symptoms; and over TAU (g= 0. 4) and comparators pooled (g= 0. 3) for general psychopathology. In the randomised controlled study, MCT demonstrated large effects on two capacity outcomes; overall capacity (d= 0. 96, p<. 05) and appreciation (d= 0. 87, p<. 05). Exploratory analyses suggested a mediating effect of JTC (d= 0. 64, p<. 05). Interpretation SST demonstrates a magnitude of effect for negative symptoms similar to those commonly reported for CBT for positive symptoms and may have potential for wider implementation in mental healthcare settings. The randomised controlled study suggests that psycho-educational interventions targeting capacity have clinical utility and may be developed for implementation. Limitations included lack of blinding, no fidelity checks and inclusion based on clinical diagnosis therefore a larger randomised controlled trial addressing these limitations is warranted...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, the human {{development}} and capability approach achieved considerable expertise and voice {{in many areas}} of development research, policy and practice. Poverty and gender, justice and human rights, ethics and empowerment – to name a few – are fields to which HDCA has been contributing for long. However, the environment and environmental sustainability have been relatively neglected. At least so it may seem. This is would be both a surprise and a considerable lacuna. The entitlement to lead a life in human <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> with valuable <b>choices</b> cannot be a privilege of only those living today. Moreover, environmental challenges affect the lives of millions of people, often very immediately and brutally. This edition of Maitreyee therefore aims to show that the human development capability approach has in fact some important insights and messages to offer. We have invited four HDCA researchers to contribute and begin with a brief overview of some important contributions of the capability approach to environmental protection and sustainability issues. Our next Maitreyee will be in September 2011. If you wish to contribute and/or propose a topic and be guest editor, please do contact us...|$|R

40|$|Hate speech law can {{be found}} {{throughout}} the world. But {{it is also the}} subject of numerous principled arguments, both for and against. These principles invoke a host of morally relevant features (e. g., liberty, health, autonomy, security, non-subordination, the absence of oppression, human dignity, the discovery of truth, the acquisition of knowledge, self-realization, human excellence, civic <b>dignity,</b> cultural diversity <b>and</b> <b>choice,</b> recognition of cultural identity, intercultural dialogue, participation in democratic self-government, being subject only to legitimate rule) and practical considerations (e. g., efficacy, the least restrictive alternative, chilling effects). The book develops and then critically examines these various principled arguments. It also attempts to de-homogenize hate speech law into different clusters of laws/regulations/ codes that constrain uses of hate speech, so as to facilitate a more nuanced examination of the principled arguments. Finally, it argues that it is morally fitting for judicial and legislative judgments about the overall warrant of hate speech law to reflect principled compromise. Principled compromise is characterized not merely by compromise over matters of principled concern but also by compromise, which is itself governed by ideals of moral duty or civic virtue (e. g., reciprocity, equality, mutual respect) ...|$|R
40|$|Participatory {{research}} into how {{people living in}} material poverty define and experience wellbeing and illbeing is increasingly common in developed and developing countries. Such research {{highlights the importance of}} experiential aspects such as being respected and able to preserve one's <b>dignity,</b> <b>and</b> having meaningful <b>choices.</b> But these findings rarely cover children’s experiences and are often not contextualised or triangulated with other data. The paper will extend this exploration using data from qualitative research with a sub-sample of children aged 11 to 13 in three urban and rural communities, drawn from Young Lives, a long-term international research project investigating the changing nature of childhood poverty in four countries, including Ethiopia. It addresses firstly how understandings of a good life and what is needed to achieve this differ between different types of community and children from different backgrounds within those communities (for example, boys and girls, children from richer or poorer households), and secondly the place of social relationships in understandings of a good life. The paper confirms the importance of children taking at least a ‘partial role’ in measuring and monitoring their well-being (Ben Arieh, 2005, 575) and provides an example of how this might be done.

40|$|Death {{and dying}} are {{emerging}} as substantial topics {{for political and}} social debate in contemporary UK society. The management of end of life, traditionally defined within a medical model of care, is being challenged by a cultural shift that is apparent in the changing trajectory of dying, increasing healthcare consumerism and a rising human rights rhetoric. To a significant extent, liberty to determine one’s own death, and to request assistance to die, {{has come to be}} articulated by some as a “right to die”. Human rights discourses grounded in the values of <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> freedom of <b>choice</b> are important <b>and</b> relevant to dying in the UK. These discourses have the potential to influence law and policy, practices and public opinion on end of life. However, there is no sociological analysis of how or when rights have come to be appropriated in an end of life context and no explanation of in what way, or to what extent, social actors are using rights discourses in relation to death and dying. This research explores the centrality of human rights discourses to end of life policy and debate on assisted death in the UK. A broad social constructionist approach to rights is taken to illuminate the ways in which selected actors understand and articulate rights in an end of life context, and how, as a result of this, a right to die may be conceived. It includes the examination of: current UK law and policy documents; transcripts of the historical and contemporary House of Lords debates; a case study of a highly influential organisation (Dignity in Dying) who campaign to legalise assisted dying, and three focus group discussions with Death Café Hampstead participants. Analysis of the data reveals that rights discourses involving individual liberty, <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> human vulnerability are central to defining the end of life debate and policy. A notion of rights {{at the end of life}} has impacted our perception of dying but in ways that are complex, and arise as a reflection of dying at a specific period in time...|$|R
