5|$|Thomas Paine's {{pamphlet}} Common Sense {{was published}} in January 1776, just as it became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined {{to act as a}} <b>conciliator.</b> Paine had only recently arrived in the colonies from England, and he argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating republicanism as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule. Common Sense introduced no new ideas and probably had little direct effect on Congress's thinking about independence; its importance was in stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss. Public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after the publication of Paine's enormously popular pamphlet.|$|E

25|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war period, Aaron {{served as a}} <b>conciliator</b> with the United States Conciliation Service and helped settle a number of labor disputes—particularly in California's aircraft industry during the post-war wave of strikes. President Harry S. Truman appointed {{him to be a}} public member of the Wage Stabilization Board on July 5, 1951. He was a strong critic of the Board's case-by-case method of awarding pay increases. During the 1952 steel strike, he played a role as a go-between for the United Steelworkers of America and the Board. President Truman appointed him vice chairman of the Board on May 29, 1952. Aaron was deeply critical of congressional efforts to cut the Board's budget, and declared that Congress should either fully fund the Board's activities or have the courage to legislate the Board out of existence.|$|E
25|$|His best-known {{and most}} highly {{regarded}} {{work is the}} multi-volume novel The Book of the New Sun. Set in a bleak, distant future influenced by Jack Vance's Dying Earth series, the story details the life of Severian, a journeyman torturer, exiled from his guild for showing compassion {{to one of the}} condemned. The novel is composed of the volumes The Shadow of the Torturer (1980), The Claw of the <b>Conciliator</b> (1981), winner of the Nebula Award for Best Novel, The Sword of the Lictor (1982), and The Citadel of the Autarch (1983). A coda, The Urth of the New Sun (1987), wraps up some loose ends but is generally considered a separate work. Several Wolfe essays about the writing of The Book of the New Sun were published in The Castle of the Otter (1982); the title refers to a misprint of the fourth book's title in Locus magazine).|$|E

40|$|An {{institute}} of <b>conciliators</b> was established for realization of agrarian reform of 1861. However, during the 1960 s it satisfied the government {{less and less}} as it was not legally subordinate to the local government. As a result, the system of local institutions was reformed in 1874. Collective district offices on peasants’ affairs were established instead of the liquidated {{institute of}} <b>conciliators.</b> Martial law was in force in the territory of Belarus, {{and for this reason}} there were no district councils and judicial institutions in 1864. Besides, the government did not trust the local nobility of the Roman-Catholic religion, the representatives of which contributed to establishment of the district offices on peasants’ affairs. For this reason the district institutions of the new type started to work in the territory of Vitebsk, Minsk and Mogilev provinces, and the institute of <b>conciliators</b> continued its work in the Vilna and Grodno provinces. In the beginning of the 1980 s the district offices on peasants’ affairs were admitted inefficient, and as a result in 1889 they were replaced by heads of district councils. However, they existed for almost 20 years more in the territory of the three provinces of Belarus. Numerous reports of governors of the country about the inefficiency of the district offices on peasants’ affairs convinced the government of the necessity to liquidate the latter {{in the beginning of the}} 20 th century...|$|R

25|$|Ganga is a consort to {{all three}} major male deities of Hinduism. As Brahma's partner she always travels {{with him in the}} form of water in his kamandalu (water-pot).

In one popular story, envious of being outdone by each other, the wives begin to quarrel. While Lakshmi {{attempts}} to mediate the quarrel, Ganga and Sarasvati heap misfortune on each other. They curse each other to become rivers, and to carry within them, by washing, the sins of their human worshippers. Soon their husband, Vishnu, arrives and decides to calm the situation by separating the goddesses.

Ganga and Sarasvati, however, are so distraught at this dispensation, and wail so loudly, that Vishnu is forced to take back his words. Consequently, in their lives as rivers they are still thought to be with him.|$|E
25|$|The Russians {{entered the}} country, {{but did not}} {{participate}} in any major engagements, and in fact they bid their time, as Peter posed as the <b>conciliator</b> between the Commonwealth king and the szlachta. Crucially, the Russians did not support the Confederates as promised, and instead insisted on bringing both sides to the negotiating table. The civil war lasted for a year; and the outcome hung in the balance. Saxon forces under command of Jacob Heinrich von Flemming enjoyed military superiority, and advanced south-eastwards, taking Zamość (this victory was however accomplished less through military tactics than through diplomacy and a treachery). In January, negotiations in Rawa Ruska led to a temporary ceasefire, but it did not hold, particularly as the Russians encouraged the Confederates to be more aggressive. The confederates pushed back against Augustus forces, entering Wielkopolska, and taking Poznań. They gained support from a local Wielkopolska confederation, and from Lithuania. Neither side was however posed to take victory, and the Russian pressure mounted; eventually the Russians declared that they will consider any side that does not enter negotiations an enemy and open hostilities with them.|$|E

25|$|In 1717, Russia {{cemented}} {{its position}} as the dominant force in Poland, {{in the aftermath of}} the Great Northern War and amid the growing likelihood of a civil war in Poland between the Polish king August II the Strong and the Polish nobility. Russian tsar Peter I the Great, posing as the <b>conciliator</b> between the Commonwealth king and the szlachta, ordered units of the Russian army to enter Polish territory—using the treaties of alliance from the Great Northern War—and coerced the Polish Sejm of 1717 into accepting his 'compromise'. During that Sejm (known as the Silent Sejm, as only one person was allowed to speak aloud), laws were passed that not only eliminated the possibility of August strengthening his power, but also ensured by means of restricted taxation (and thus a constrained Polish army) that Poland would not be able to interfere with similar Russian interventions in the future. In reality, if not the letter of the law, the reforms of the Silent Sejm meant that the Commonwealth became a Russian protectorate, and it would be Russian ambassadors and envoys who would be responsible for this territory under the tsar. In 1730 than Russian ambassador to Poland, Karl Gustav von Löwenwolde, was instrumental in the Alliance of the Three Black Eagles (or Löwenwolde's Treaty), an agreement between Commonwealth's neighbours to preserve the dysfunctional state of affairs within it. Russian influence on Poland further increased during the War of the Polish Succession (1733–1738), when Russian military intervention overturned the result of the royal election of Stanisław Leszczyński.|$|E
25|$|A second {{labor dispute}} halted {{work on the}} bridge when 200 members of Sand and Gravel Workers Union Local 22075 went out on strike over a refusal by the Smoot Sand and Gravel Corporation to adopt the closed shop. The strike, which began on August 14, {{immediately}} halted concrete work {{not only on the}} new Sousa Bridge but on more than 20 building and transportation infrastructure projects, and idled more than 5,000 workers. Howard T. Colvin, a United States Department of Labor <b>conciliator,</b> was called in to help end the dispute. Initially, Colvin expressed optimism that the strike could be settled swiftly. But the union rejected a potential settlement on August 23 because it lacked specific wage and hour agreements. On August 25, Representative William Alvin Pittenger (R-Minnesota) asked the Army Corps of Engineers to break the strike and supply sand and gravel itself. The Army refused. On August 28, the federal government intervened in the strike. Federal Works Agency Administrator John M. Carmody questioned why the single source was used to supply all the sand and gravel to so much projects, and threatened to find a new supplier if a settlement was not forthcoming. John R. Steelman, head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, announced he was personally interveneing in the negotiations {{to bring an end to}} the strike. Meanwhile, Colvin proposed a strike settlement which was immediately accepted by the union and rejected by the company. Carmody and Steelman's intervention appeared to work. Progress in strike talks was announced on August 30, and on September 5 the company and union ended the strike after agreeing to Colvin's terms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{considers}} {{the nature of}} conflict {{in relation to the}} environments within which distributed teams cooperate. Effective conflict management can bring great benefits to distributed teams, while inadequate conflict resolution strategies can incur significant personal and resource costs. The increased geographical, cognitive and emotional distances between members can stimulate and amplify conflict. Parties may display disinhibited behaviour (flaming) or may be reluctant to accept reconciliatory overtures (low trust). These factors {{can be attributed to the}} impact of communication technology on social structures that underlie interaction. Shifting to face-to-face meetings can be impractical or involve prohibitive cost, so it is important to establish how best to deal with conflict in technologically-mediated settings. Dispute resolution practitioners (<b>conciliators)</b> have evolved strategies and techniques to construct and regulate "safe-spaces"; settings that are conducive to finding creative solutions to entrenched conflicts. Building on interviews with expert <b>conciliators,</b> we discuss the potential for learning from the structure and constraints of conciliation environments in order to improve conflict management through technologies...|$|R

500|$|The {{next phase}} of the myth begins when the adult Horus {{challenges}} Set for the throne of Egypt. The contest between them is often violent but is also described as a legal judgment before the Ennead, an assembled group of Egyptian deities, to decide who should inherit the kingship. The judge in this trial may be Geb, who, {{as the father of}} Osiris and Set, held the throne before they did, or it may be the creator gods Ra or Atum, the originators of kingship. Other deities also take important roles: Thoth frequently acts as a <b>conciliator</b> in the dispute or as an assistant to the divine judge, and in [...] "Contendings", Isis uses her cunning and magical power to aid her son.|$|E
500|$|Luis has a mixed racial background, {{including}} South American, Japanese and European heritage. He is {{also brought}} up by his father, 4-Nova Ed, a man whose life is described as being centered on his sexual activity, and who {{is very different from}} the thoughtful and introverted Luis. Luis also has a memorable experience with the virtual reality tapes, although his occurs in adolescence. Luis subverts a program by remaining in a jungle he is supposed to walk through, and just watching the animal life around him. He sees a large spotted cat, and is [...] "transfixed" [...] by its elegance and the fact that it simply ignores him. The brief experience with [...] "wildness" [...] and independence from humans, even though it is part of a human-made program, [...] "strangely enriches" [...] his thinking. In college Luis studies to become a doctor, and also becomes interested in exploring the educational program for future generations. This leads him to uncover the angels' attempts at erasure and propaganda, and to demanding the creation of a committee on religious manipulation. His role as a <b>conciliator</b> following Hiroshi's announcement leads to his election as Chair of the ship's council. Eventually he also chooses to live on Hsin Ti Chiu.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the Eye wanders in {{a distant}} land—Nubia, Libya, or Punt. She {{takes the form of}} a wild feline, as {{dangerous}} and uncontrolled as the forces of chaos that she is meant to subdue. To restore order, one of the gods goes out to retrieve her. In one version, known from scattered allusions, the warrior god Anhur searches for the Eye, which takes the form of the goddess Mehit, using his skills as a hunter. In other accounts, it is Shu who searches for Tefnut, who in this case represents the Eye rather than an independent deity. Thoth, who often serves as a messenger and <b>conciliator</b> in the Egyptian pantheon, can also seek the wandering goddess. His role in retrieving the Eye of Ra parallels his role in the Osiris myth, in which he heals or returns Horus' lost Eye. In a Late Period papyrus dubbed [...] "The Myth of the Eye of the Sun", Thoth persuades the Eye of Ra to return through a combination of lectures, enticement, and entertaining stories. His efforts are not uniformly successful; at one point, the goddess is so enraged by Thoth's words that she transforms from a relatively benign cat into a fire-breathing lioness, making Thoth jump.|$|E
