5000|$|In {{business}} economics <b>cost</b> <b>breakdown</b> analysis {{is a method}} of cost analysis, which itemizes {{the cost of a}} certain product or service into its various components, the so-called cost drivers. The <b>cost</b> <b>breakdown</b> analysis is a popular cost reduction strategy and a viable opportunity for businesses. [...] "Cost breakdown analysis is the process to build and understand the elements that compose the cost of a product or service. This technique is also referred to as Clean Sheet Costing, Open Book Costing ...Tear down analysis, Price Breakdown Analysis or Supplier Cost Analysis" [...] The price of a product or service is defined as cost plus profit, whereas cost can be broken down further into direct cost and indirect cost. As a business has virtually no influence on indirect cost, a cost reduction oriented <b>cost</b> <b>breakdown</b> analysis focuses rather on factors contributing to direct cost. The most common factors among direct cost are labor, raw materials and subcontracting. These are aspects of a business, over which it has direct control and which, in turn, enables the business to identify ways to save expenditure by the proper application of a <b>cost</b> <b>breakdown</b> analysis. Businesses can also combine this strategy with a value chain analysis, which allows price forecasts and hence, quicker responses to changes in the market.|$|E

40|$|A {{life cycle}} cost {{analysis}} of surface coatings used for corrosion management is developed for assets consisting of an onshore processing plant, fixed offshore platform and FPSO.

The primary cost driver is labour costs in external service contracts. Life cycle cost varies linearly with the annual surface area covered by the maintenance campaigns.

50|$|The {{following}} {{examples include}} fictional numbers, lack complexity concerning the cost drivers and are merely used {{to display the}} method of <b>cost</b> <b>breakdown</b> analyses.

50|$|The {{indicators}} {{that have been}} identified are allocated percentages and in a detailed <b>cost</b> <b>breakdown</b> analysis these indicators should add up closely to 100%. This process requires an in-depth analysis of the business's expenses.For simplicity's sake, these random percentages have been assigned to the six cost drivers of transportation this example entails. After this step, the cost drivers are being analyzed while the analyzing party (be it the business itself or an external agency) tries to examine possibilities to cut current expenses. The business might find 42% of total costs {{to be too much}} for motor fuel and might either want to look for an alternative supplier or change to more fuel efficient trucks. The <b>cost</b> <b>breakdown</b> analysis is even more effective when repeated constantly, so that changes in the respective shares in total costs of the various cost drivers can be tracked down. Over a five-year period, the share of expenses for tires might have risen from 5% to 8%, accompanied by a decrease of expenses for personnel from 35% to 32%, which featured the dismissal of workforce. The business might want to consider contracting a cheaper supplier of tires and reemploy its former employees.|$|E

50|$|All {{other things}} being equal, the same airline will have lower CASM, RASM and yield as stage length increases, since fixed costs are spread over {{increasingly}} larger average flight lengths. Therefore, to properly compare these quantities across airlines (or even across the same airline for two different periods if the airline's average stage length has changed significantly) requires settling on a common assumed stage length and then adjusting CASM, RASM and yield appropriately.

This did not escape notice of local financiers, publicly known initially as Thomas F. Penman, John H. Brooks, C.K. Bedford, S.S. Spruks, Charles Gunster, Herman Osthaus, and Hayden Evans, suggesting the public's increasing interest was income that could otherwise be earned locally.

Some historical <b>cost</b> <b>breakdowns</b> for unmanned NASA payloads are presented to suggest where future cost reductions could be most significant. Space programs of NOAA, DoD and COMSAT are then examined to ascertain if payload reductions have been brought about by the operational (as opposed to developmental) nature of such programs, economies of scale, the ability to rely on previously developed technology, or by differing management structures and attitudes. The potential impact was investigated of NASA aircraft-type management on spacecraft program costs, and some examples relating previous costs associated with aircraft costs {{on the one hand and}} manned and unmanned costs on the other are included...|$|R
