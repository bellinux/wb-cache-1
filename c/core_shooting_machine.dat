40|$|High-temperature stable aerogels {{are often}} brittle {{and prone to}} fractures. It {{is not easy to}} produce defined shapes or large complex shaped forms. Looking at the casting industry, they make defined, very complex moldings out of sand and binder by {{shooting}} sandcores with a so called <b>core</b> <b>shooting</b> <b>machine.</b> A wide range of binders (inorganic or organic, hot-box or cold-box, etc.) are used. Binder contents of 0. 5 – 4 weight-% are common. In our study we used a sandcore-shooting-machine to produce simple and complex parts of aerogels. Different types of aerogels, grain sizes and binder systems were examined. Amount of binder, curing time and shooting pressure also play an important role. Superplasticizer and / or release agents were used to facilitate the shooting process and the core / part removal. Not all recipes appeared to produce aerogel parts successfully. Only through the adjustments of the experimental conditions stable cores and parts of aerogel could be produced. More binder content and a longer curing time at lower temperatures are needed. Thermal conductivity measurements and mechanical properties are presented...|$|E

In this paper, the flow behavior of sand particles in the core box was investigated synchronously with transparent core box, high-speed camera, and pressure measuring system. The flow pattern of sand particles in the shooting head of the <b>core</b> <b>shooting</b> <b>machine</b> was reproduced with various colored core sand layers. Taking both kinetic and frictional stress into account, a kinetic-frictional constitutive correlation was established to describe the internal momentum transfer in the solid phase. Two-fluid model (TFM) simulations with turbulence model were then performed and good agreement was achieved between the experimental and simulation results on the flow behavior of sand particles in both the shooting head and the core box. Based on the experimental and simulation results, the flow behavior of sand particles in the core box, the formation of “dead zone” in the shooting head, and the effect of drag force were analyzed in terms of sand volume fraction (αs), sand velocity (Vs), and pressure variation (P) ...|$|E

40|$|The casting {{of metals}} and alloys is very often {{performed}} into moulds made of sands bonded by organic and inorganic binder-systems. Experience during the industrial tests of the AeroSands showed {{that there are still}} many open issues to reduce casting defects associated with the conventional sand-binder system. This knowledge inspired the new developments of inorganic and organic aerogels in a granular form. Simply a small part of any sand used in foundries is replaced by granular aerogels and commonly mixed with the normally used binder-system to prepare cores manually or using a <b>core</b> <b>shooting</b> <b>machine.</b> It turns out that adding granular aerogels (nano-additives) to sand-binder systems are beneficial for sand moulds and cores and lead to improved cast parts. To prove the benefit of the nano-additives scientifically systematically tests are performed. Therefore bending bars having a dimension of 20 mm x 20 mm x 100 mm are used. The matrix includes: type and amount of aerogel, sand, binder-system, metals or alloys, casting temperature, and others. The characterisation and classification of the results is based on several measurement methods for the sand cores like: bending strength, abrasion resistance, gas permeability, thermal decomposition with thermogravimetry combined with FTIR as well as fracture path and bonding bridges by SEM. And further on for the casting and the cast parts: tests to analyze amount and time of gas emission, quality of the surface finishing, the amount of baking due to binder oxidation and pyrolysis, metal penetration, or gas bubbles under the metals surface and ease of core removal. All results of the tests analysis are established in a database. Theoretically one of the major effects to evaluate the best working aerogel granulate is given by the application temperature. But surprisingly for organic aerogels it is shown that they still work during casting processes with temperatures above 350 °C, their decomposition temperature. To understand this effect thermal conductivity and thermal decomposition (TGA-FTIR) is measured, evaluated and the results are discussed. Within the presentation it will be shown how perfect the properties of the used aerogels fit the necessities of casting defects. In addition an insight to the industrial applications will be provided. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Core</b> <b>shooting</b> process plays {{a decisive}} {{role in the}} quality of sand cores, and core box vents {{distribution}} {{is one of the most}} important factor determining the effectiveness of <b>core</b> <b>shooting</b> process. In this paper, the influence of core box vents distribution on the flow dynamics of <b>core</b> <b>shooting</b> process was investigated based on in situ experimental observations with transparent core box, high-speed camera and pressure measuring system. Attention was focused on the variation of both the flow behavior of sand and pressure curves due to different vents distribution. Taking both kinetic and frictional stress into account, a kinetic-frictional constitutive model was established to describe the internal momentum transfer in the solid phase. Two-fluid model (TFM) simulation was then performed and good agreement was achieved between the experimental and simulated results on both the flow behavior of sand and the pressure curves. It was found that vents distribution has direct effect on the pressure difference of different locations in the core box, which determines the buoyancy force exerting on the sand particles and significantly influences the filling process of core sand...|$|R

40|$|<b>Core</b> <b>shooting</b> {{process is}} {{the most widely used}} {{technique}} to make sand cores and it {{plays an important role in}} the quality of sand cores. Although numerical simulation can hopefully optimize the <b>core</b> <b>shooting</b> process, research on numerical simulation of the <b>core</b> <b>shooting</b> process is very limited. Based on a two-fluid model (TFM) and a kinetic-friction constitutive correlation, a program for 3 D numerical simulation of the <b>core</b> <b>shooting</b> process has been developed and achieved good agreements with in-situ experiments. To match the needs of engineering applications, a graphics processing unit (GPU) has also been used to improve the calculation efficiency. The parallel algorithm based on the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform can significantly decrease computing time by multi-threaded GPU. In this work, the program accelerated by CUDA parallelization method was developed and the accuracy of the calculations was ensured by comparing with in-situ experimental results photographed by a high-speed camera. The design and optimization of the parallel algorithm were discussed. The simulation result of a sand core test-piece indicated the improvement of the calculation efficiency by GPU. The developed program has also been validated by in-situ experiments with a transparent core-box, a high-speed camera, and a pressure measuring system. The computing time of the parallel program was reduced by nearly 95 % while the simulation result was still quite consistent with experimental data. The GPU parallelization method can successfully solve the problem of low computational efficiency of the 3 D sand shooting simulation program, and thus the developed GPU program is appropriate for engineering applications...|$|R

For {{the poor}} degree of {{stability}} and limitation of shooting dexterity of existing stop-motion <b>shooting</b> <b>machine,</b> the overall structure of a new stop-motion shooting robot is developed. Based on the analysis on the shooting requirement, the lens motion space and motion way of the robot are set up, and the structure sketch is proposed. The distance between the adjacent joints is obtained according to the robot kinematics analysis by means of D-H method, and overall design of the robot is established. A new wire-drive device is proposed to improve flexibility of the motion part, and is applied to drive holder. Comparing with existing stop-motion <b>shooting</b> <b>machine,</b> the robot has high stability and good flexibility. The overall design may also play a fundamental part in further detail design of the articulated stop-motion shooting robot...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of core sand properties on flow dynamics was investigated synchronously with various core sands, transparent core-box and high-speed camera. To confirm whether the <b>core</b> <b>shooting</b> process has significant turbulence, the flow pattern of sand {{particles in the}} <b>shooting</b> head and <b>core</b> box was reproduced with colored core sands. By incorporating the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF), kinetic-frictional constitutive correlation and turbulence model, a two-fluid model (TFM) was established to study the flow dynamics of the <b>core</b> <b>shooting</b> process. Two-fluid model (TFM) simulations were then performed and a areasonable agreement was achieved between the simulation and experimental results.
