Minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) based optimum weights of the per-tone equalizers are derived for SISO (single-input single-output), SIMO (single-input multipleoutput), and MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) SC-CP systems. Unlike conventional frequency domain equalization methods, where discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is employed, the per-tone equalizers utilize sliding DFT, {{which makes it}} possible to achieve good performance even when the length of the guard interval is shorter than the channel order. Computer simulation results show that the proposed equalizers can significantly improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of the SISO, SIMO, and MIMO SC-CP systems with the insufficient guard interval. key words: per-tone equalization, single <b>carrier</b> <b>block</b> transmission, cyclic prefix 1...|$|E

The nanocomposites are made by sintering PbTe–Ag_ 2 Te nanowire heterostructures produced in a highly scalable solution-phase synthesis. Compared with Ag_ 2 Te nanowire-based nanocomposite produced in similar method, the PbTe–Ag_ 2 Te nanocomposite containing ∼ 5 atomic % PbTe exhibits enhanced Seebeck coefficient, reduced thermal conductivity, and ∼ 40 % improved ZT, which can be well explained by the theoretical modeling based on the Boltzmann transport equations when energy barriers for both electrons and holes at the heterostructure interfaces are considered in the calculations. For this p-type PbTe–Ag_ 2 Te nanocomposite, the barriers for electrons, that is, minority carriers, are primarily responsible for the ZT enhancement.

In the proposed scheme, we simply force the received signals which are collapsed by the burst noise to be zeros. Since this processing introduces an inter-symbol interference (ISI), which cannot be effectively equalized with a conventional frequency domain equalizer (FDE), we also propose an ISI cancellation scheme. We firstly generate a replica signal of the ISI using tentative decisions {{in order to}} make the defective channel matrix to be circulant, and then the conventional frequency domain equalization is performed to compensate the ISI. Also, we have utilized newly derived minimum mean–square–error (MMSE) based FDE weights for the replica signals generation. Computer simulation results show that the proposed burst noise cancellation scheme with the ISI cancellation can significantly improve the bit error rate (BER) performance even when almost 10 % of the received signals are collapsed by the burst noise.
