50|$|The {{company that}} created the Kardomah brand began in Pudsey Street, Liverpool in 1844 as the Vey Brothers teadealers and grocers. In 1868 the {{business}} was acquired by the newly created Liverpool China and India Tea Company, {{and a series of}} brand names was created beginning with Mikado. The Kardomah brand of tea was first served at the Liverpool colonial exhibition of 1887, and the brand was later applied to a range of teas, coffees and coffee houses. The parent company was renamed Kardomah Limited in 1938. The brand was acquired by the Forte Group in 1962, sold to Cadbury/Schweppes/Typhoo in 1971, and became part of Premier Brands some time between 1980 and 1997. The brand still exists, selling items such as instant coffee and <b>coffee</b> <b>whitener.</b>|$|E

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} of coffee flavor have {{been confined to}} the analysis of the aroma substances. These investigations showed that about 30 volatile compounds were substantially responsible for the coffee flavor. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of different milk additives and one <b>coffee</b> <b>whitener</b> on the release of flavor impact compounds from coffee beverages. For the investigation of these effects an external static headspace technique was developed. With this technique the most potent odorants of the coffee beverage were determined. Analyses were performed by gas chromatography/olfactometry, flame ionization detection, and mass spectrometric detection. In addition, sensory studies of the odor profiles were performed. Milk and vegetable products as additives for coffee beverages affected the release of aroma substances in the brew through their lipid, protein, and carbohydrate components. All beverages with an additive showed reduced, but typical, odor profiles for each additive...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopic evaluation method of brewed coffee, whose quality and taste depend highly on properties {{such as the}} geographical origin and the roasting, grinding, blending, and extraction conditions, using an FT-IR spectrometer equipped with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory. In addition, the simultaneous content determination of {{the main components of}} coffee drink was performed by applying the FT-IR/ATR method. We studied the effects of different varieties of coffee and the degree of roasting on the MIR spectral characteristics of brewed coffee and determined the caffeine and chlorogenic acid content using the FT-IR/ATR method. Arabica (from Colombia, Brazil, and Guatemala) and Robusta (from Indonesia) coffee roasted to city was prepared as the sample. Indonesian coffee roasted to full city was also used. The differences between the second derivatives of the ATR spectra of the brewed Arabica and Robusta coffee were observed around the several absorption peaks, and the brewed coffee from Brazil had different spectral features from those of the other varieties of Arabica coffee. Additionally, the roasting conditions of the Indonesian beans were reflected in the spectral features of the brewed coffee. Moreover, the caffeine and chlorogenic acid content in brewed coffee was determined by spectroscopy. For the coffee drink that was composed of instant coffee, sugar, and <b>coffee</b> <b>whitener,</b> the content of each component was excellently determined using the FT-IR/ATR method by analyzing the spectroscopic interactions between the component...|$|E
40|$|The physical, {{chemical}} and microbiological properties of hydrogenated {{palm kernel oil}} (PKO) and cold-pressed rice bran oil (RBO) as ingredients {{in the production of}} liquid and powdered non-dairy creamer (<b>coffee</b> <b>whitener)</b> were studied. The mixing ratios between hydrogenated PKO and cold-pressed RBO were statistically designed as of 100 : 0, 90 : 10, 80 : 20, 70 : 30, 60 : 40, 50 : 50, 40 : 60, 30 : 70, 20 : 80, 10 : 90 and 0 : 100. The color, absorbanceand viscosity of the mixtures were investigated. As the ratio of cold-pressed RBO increased, the color became darker (L*of 93. 06 to 86. 25) and the absorbance significantly increased, while the viscosity of the mixtures of 20 : 80, 10 : 90 and 0 : 100 (54 cp.) were the highest amongst the ratios tested. The hydrogenated PKO and cold-pressed RBO mixtures were further chemically tested for fatty acids, -oryzanol, -tocopherol, trans-fat contents andantioxidant activity. There were 10 fatty acids present in hydrogenated PKO with saturated fatty acid being the most predominant. Comparatively, there were only 5 fatty acids found in cold-pressed RBO with monounsaturated fatty acid being the major fatty acid. -Oryzanol and -tocopherol contents were higher with increasingcold-pressed RBO from 0 - 100 % (0 to 1, 155. 00 mg/ 100 g oil and 0. 09 to 30. 82 mg/ 100 g oil, respectively). Antioxidant activity was increased with increasing cold-pressed RBO from 0 - 100 % (9. 26 to 94. 24 %). The pure hydrogenated PKO contained higher trans-fat content than that of the 90 : 10 and 80 : 20 mixtures (2. 73, 1. 93 and 1. 85 mg/ 100 g oil,respectively) while other samples had no trans-fat. No microorganisms were present in any of the samples. Therefore, substitution of hydrogenated PKO by cold-pressed RBO from 30 - 100 % would offer more nutritional values and better {{chemical and}} physical properties of non-dairy creamer...|$|E
50|$|Non-dairy {{creamers}} or <b>coffee</b> <b>whiteners</b> are liquid or granular substances {{intended to}} substitute for milk or cream as an additive to coffee, tea, hot chocolate or other beverages. They do not contain lactose and therefore are commonly described as not being dairy products, although many contain casein, a milk-derived protein. Dry granular products {{do not need to}} be refrigerated and can be used and stored in locations which do not have a refrigerator. Liquid non-dairy creamers should be tightly capped and refrigerated after opening. Some non-dairy creamers contain sweeteners and flavours, such as vanilla, hazelnut or Irish cream. As with other processed food products, low calorie and low fat versions are available for non-dairy creamers.|$|R
40|$|Steam-jet {{granulation}} is {{a process}} used in dairy industry to produce instant agglomerated milk powder. Agglomerated instant powders exhibit improved wettability and rehydration behaviour, which are essential attributes for <b>coffee</b> <b>whiteners</b> applications. Although {{there is a growing}} interest for research in this area, the steam-jet granulation process has been little studied to date and the quality control at industrial scale remains experimental and empirical. Moreover, the multi-factorial causes {{at the root of the}} rehydration properties of the final agglomerates make it difficult to identify the key process parameters that should be controlled to meet the quality requirements. The present study investigated industrial data to study how different raw materials properties and process parameters interact and contribute to the production of skim milk agglomerates with improved functional properties. Dynamic vapour sorption and differential scanning calorimetry were used to characterize both the native raw materials and the agglomerated powders. A multivariate data analysis was used to identify correlations between the raw material properties, the process parameters and the physicochemical and functional properties of the products. The water content of the native raw material and the post-drying temperature were found to be critical in controlling the humidity and thermodynamical properties (glass transition temperature) of the agglomerates. These properties were correlated to the wetting time and showed their significant influence on the rehydration behaviour of the agglomerates. Recommendations concerning production parameters are given to avoid conform rehydration behaviour in industrial agglomerated skim milk powder...|$|R
