The minister Lee Changdong had a background as a movie director and a political chairman <b>of</b> anti-screen <b>quota</b> union. Thus, the minister used to hold a firm stance toward <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> screen <b>quotas.</b> However, there were several political barriers that resisted Lee from holding onto his belief. The dominant opinion of the politics was that screen quotas should quickly {{be dealt with by}} accepting the requirements of America. The government also argued that the screen quota was paralysing other important policies. Moreover, President Roh Muhyeon had a firm belief that South Korea - America FTA should be signed as fast as possible, with all the obstacles such as screen quotas being solved quickly.|$|R

Using Austrian FADN data and applying a mathematical programming model, {{the impact of the}} CAP reform on Austrian farms with milk quota endowments as well as the impact of future milk market regulations after 2015 will be analysed. Possible options include either a <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>quota</b> system or its abolishment. The model simulations show that in the scenario referring to 2008 most farms are better off due to the Austrian implementation of the CAP reform compared to a pre-reform situation. Whether farms are better off with or without a milk quota system in 2015 depends on the assumed level of the milk price. However, smaller farms are, on average, better off without a quota regulation. 2003 CAP reform, milk quota, mathematical programming, Austria, Agricultural and Food Policy, Demand and Price Analysis, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{countries}} are demanding {{a greater role}} in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations than they received in previous rounds. Agriculture remains an important sector for most developing countries and this sector could yet be a stumbling block in the current negotiations. Avoiding an impasse requires an analysis of the potential gains and losses from further trade liberalisation. Since the Uruguay Round, analysis of trade liberalisation has been made more complex by the introduction of the tariff rate <b>quota</b> system <b>of</b> regulating access to agricultural markets. The Agricultural Trade Policy Simulation Model (ATPSM) is a static, multi-commodity, multi-region, partial equilibrium trade model that takes into account the distribution <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> rent and differences in bound and applied tariff rates. The estimated annual static welfare gains from a <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> Uruguay Round agricultural trade liberalisation are relatively modest, at around US$ 9 billion. However, the distribution of the gains between countries depends significantly on the current allocation <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> rents...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the inefficiencies {{associated with the}} regionalisation <b>of</b> milk <b>quota</b> trade. An optimisation model is developed to estimate the economic value <b>of</b> <b>quota.</b> Quota values are aggregated to derive supply and demand curves under two scenarios; first where quotas can trade nationally and second where the trade <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> is regionally restricted. Quota trade is simulated and the consequent effects on supplier structure are estimated. Through the derivation of sectoral cumulative cost curves {{it is possible to}} estimate the impact <b>of</b> regionalising <b>quota</b> trade on sector efficiency. The model is solved using National Farm Survey data from Ireland and the inefficiencies <b>of</b> regionalised <b>quota</b> trade in Ireland is estimated at€ 20 million. The model is also used to quantify the effect of policy uncertainty on quota trade. The implications of an early abolition or expansion of the EU milk quota on quota trade is quantified. The paper concludes by discussing the implications <b>of</b> restricted <b>quota</b> trade, especially in the context <b>of</b> eventual <b>quota</b> removal...|$|R

The use <b>of</b> the <b>quotas</b> in the production process leads to their destruction and also leads to reduce the stock of resource; the non-use <b>of</b> the <b>quotas</b> allows their owner to resell them in the second time period on the financial market.

40|$|To date, {{more than}} 100 {{countries}} have implemented some type <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> {{for women in}} their national legislatures, leading {{to one of the}} most significant developments in the global composition of legislative bodies in the past twenty-five years. One remaining puzzle in understanding the global diffusion <b>of</b> electoral gender <b>quotas</b> is the strong clustering <b>of</b> shared domestic <b>quota</b> policies by region. In this project, I examine the importance of dyadic relationships between countries, including shared membership in inter-governmental organizations (IGOs), regional organizations (ROs), and women’s international non-governmental organizations(WINGOs) in explaining the timing and type <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> adoption. To do this, I employ a social network approach to quantitatively model global and temporal trends in gender quota adoption. Controlling for other possible domestic and transnational determinants, my results indicate that the strongest predictor <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> policy adoption and design is the existence of similar policies in neighboring countries. These results suggest that, in the case <b>of</b> gender <b>quota</b> adoption, domestic policymakers see surrounding states as their most salient reference group when deciding both whether and how to implement new policy...|$|R
