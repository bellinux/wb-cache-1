5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can be <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> artifact of the potential field {{in the same way}} that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E
5|$|The element hydrogen, {{with one}} {{electron}} per neutral atom, is usually {{placed at the}} top of Group 1 of the periodic table for convenience, but hydrogen is not normally <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> alkali metal; when it is <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> alkali metal, it is because of its atomic properties and not its chemical properties. Under typical conditions, pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule (H2); however, the alkali metals only form diatomic molecules (such as dilithium, Li2) at high temperatures, when they are in the gaseous state.|$|E
5|$|All Operation Crossroads {{operations}} {{were designed to}} keep personnel from being exposed to more than 0.1 roentgen (R) per day. At the time, this was <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> amount of radiation that could be tolerated for long periods without any harmful effects on health. Since there was no special clothing or radiation shielding available, the protection plan relied on managing who went where, when, and for how long.|$|E
50|$|Research by Carpéné and {{co-workers}} showed that phenylethanolamine {{did not significantly}} stimulate lipolysis in cultured adipocytes ("fat cells") from guinea pig or human. Moderate stimulation (intrinsic activities about half that of the reference standard, isoprenaline) was observed in adipocytes from rat or hamster. This lipolysis was inhibited completely by bupranolol (<b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> non-selective β-blocker), CGP 20712A (<b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> selective β1-antagonist), and ICI 118,551 (<b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> selective β2-antagonist), but not by SR 59230A (<b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> selective β3-antagonist).|$|R

5|$|In 1757, Lembi Battery {{was added}} near Tigné Point, Sliema. The battery {{was funded by}} the Manoel Foundation and it was <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> outwork of Fort Manoel, since it was {{intended}} to prevent an enemy from bombarding the fort's northern flank. It was decommissioned following the construction of Fort Tigné in 1795. The construction of the latter fort was also partially funded by the Manoel Foundation.|$|E

5|$|The Hudson County Courthouse or Justice William J. Brennan Jr. Courthouse {{is located}} in Jersey City, Hudson County, New Jersey, United States. The six-story {{structure}} was originally built between 1906 and 1910 {{at a cost of}} $3,328,016.56.

5|$|The {{sycamore}} {{has been}} introduced to suitable locations outside Europe as an attractive tree for park, street or garden. These include the United States, Canada, Australia (Victoria and Tasmania), Chile and New Zealand, Patagonia and the laurel forests of Madeira and the Azores. At {{the time of its}} introduction it was probably not appreciated that its prolific production of seeds might one day cause a problem to the landscape as it spread and out-competed native species. The tree is now <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> environmental weed in some parts of Australia (Yarra Ranges, Victoria) and also Mount Macedon, near Daylesford, parts of the Dandenong Ranges, where it is naturalised in the eucalypt forests. The sycamore is also scattered in north-eastern Tasmania and also at Taroona, near the Derwent River, in southern Hobart. It is <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> invasive species in New Zealand, Norway, and environmentally sensitive locations in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{scientific}} work, he was {{a social}} activist who was critical of what he <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his {{being one of the}} first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.|$|E

5|$|Beilein {{is known}} for his Princeton {{offensive}} system, which emphasizes constant motion, passing, disciplined teamwork, and precision shooting. The offense usually starts out with four players outside the three-point arc, and one player {{at the top of the}} key (though at times a post player may operate closer to the basket). From this formation, Beilein's teams not only try to open up space for players to cut to the basket, but also are known for their high number of three-point attempts. On defense, Beilein has become known for employing the 1–3–1 halfcourt zone defense, which is <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> unconventional zone defense – though he also regularly employs man-to-man and 2-3 zone defenses.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain had disliked what he <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> overly sentimental {{attitude}} of both Baldwin and MacDonald on Cabinet appointments and reshuffles. Although {{he had worked}} closely with the President of the Board of Trade, Walter Runciman over the tariff issue, Chamberlain dismissed him from his post, offering Runciman the token position of Lord Privy Seal, which an angry Runciman declined. Runciman, a member of the Liberal National Party, was thought by Chamberlain to be lazy. Soon after taking office, Chamberlain instructed his ministers to prepare two-year policy programmes. These reports were to be integrated with the intent of co-ordinating the passage of legislation through the current Parliament, the term of which was to expire in November 1940.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> incurable {{and rapidly}} lethal cancer unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be fully removed by surgery. No {{potentially}} curative treatment exists except surgery, {{but most people}} have advanced stage disease at presentation and are inoperable {{at the time of}} diagnosis. People with cholangiocarcinoma are generally managed - though not cured - with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other palliative care measures. These are also used as additional therapies after surgery in cases where resection has apparently been successful (or nearly so).|$|E

5|$|Recent extractions of DNA {{from the}} dodo and Rodrigues solitaire, {{as well as}} 37 species of doves, has found where in Columbidae the raphines should be placed. Surprisingly, raphines are not the most {{primitive}} columbid, instead they are grouped with the Nicobar pigeon as their closest relative, with other closely related birds being the crowned pigeons and tooth-billed pigeon. A third raphine, Raphus solitarius, is now <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> ibis in the genus Threskiornis.|$|E
5|$|The {{accretion}} process, {{by which}} 1km planetesimals grow into 1,000km sized bodies, is well understood now. This process develops inside any disk where the number density of planetesimals is sufficiently high, and proceeds in a runaway manner. Growth later slows and continues as oligarchic accretion. The {{end result is}} formation of planetary embryos of varying sizes, which depend on {{the distance from the}} star. Various simulations have demonstrated that the merger of embryos in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk leads to the formation of a few Earth-sized bodies. Thus the origin of terrestrial planets is now <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> almost solved problem.|$|E

5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of North America migrated from Siberia {{by way of}} the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival. After crossing the land bridge, the first Americans moved southward, either along the Pacific coast or through an interior ice-free corridor between the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets. The Clovis culture appeared around 11,000 BC, and it is <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the Americas. While the Clovis culture was thought, throughout the late 20th century, to represent the first human settlement of the Americas, in recent years consensus has changed in recognition of pre-Clovis cultures.|$|E
5|$|The song {{along with}} the album Diva are <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> {{important}} factor to reggaeton's mainstream exposure in 2004 alongside Daddy Yankee's Barrio Fino and Tego Calderon's El Enemy de los Guasibiri. The song became the first Spanish-language song to reach #1 on Miami's WPOW Rhythmic Top 40 while reaching the Top 10 of the Billboard Latin Rhythm Airplay chart. An accompanying music video was filmed for the song. It features cameos from her ex-husband Omar Navarro, known artistically as Gran Omar. Ivy Queen performed the song {{as a part of}} the set of her 2008 World Tour which was held from the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Today, the eliminativist view is {{most closely}} {{associated}} with the philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland, who deny the existence of propositional attitudes (a subclass of intentional states), and with Daniel Dennett, who is generally <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> eliminativist about qualia and phenomenal aspects of consciousness. One way to summarize the difference between the Churchlands's views and Dennett's view is that the Churchlands are eliminativists when it comes to propositional attitudes, but reductionists concerning qualia, while Dennett is an anti-reductionist with respect to propositional attitudes, and an eliminativist concerning qualia.|$|E
