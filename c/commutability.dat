The materials used in these comparisons need to be of sufficient quality so that the comparison provides {{a picture of the}} performances. One of the main characteristics of the testing material is <b>commutability,</b> which is the ability of a material to yield the same numerical relationships between results of measurements as those relationships obtained when the same procedures are applied to patient samples. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the <b>commutability</b> of 3 different matrices for the preparation of proficiency testing material (PTM) for the analysis of carbamazepine and valproic acid. Methods: Patient samples and PTM containing various concentrations of carbamazepine and valproic acid were collected, prepared, and shipped to different laboratories for analysis. Reported results for patient samples from each laboratory were plotted against results for patient samples of each of the other laboratories, and the corresponding regression line was calculated. The distance of results from PTM to the regression line is a measure for <b>commutability.</b> The distance is expressed as a multiple of the SDwl (average within-laboratory SD as calculated from external quality assessment scheme results) and referred to as relative residual. A <b>commutability</b> decision limit of 2 SDwl was set. Results: For carbamazepine and valproic acid, a total of 78 and 105 laboratory couples respectively could be formed. The number of relative residuals for liquid human serum outside the <b>commutability</b> decision limit was 1, 4, and 0 for low, medium, and high concentrations of carbamazepine, respectively and 3, 1, and 0 for low, medium, and high concentrations of valproic acid, respectively. In both liquid and lyophilized bovine sera, the number of relative residuals outside the <b>commutability</b> decision limit was between 2 and 15 and between 6 and 21 for carbamazepine and valproic acid, respectively.

40|$|Food {{microbiology}} {{proficiency testing}} (PT) {{is a useful}} tool to assess the analytical performances among laboratories. PT items should be close to routine samples to accurately evaluate the acceptability of the methods. However, most PT providers distribute exclusively artificial samples such as reference materials or irradiated foods. This raises {{the issue of the}} suitability of these samples because the equivalence—or ‘commutability’—between results obtained on artificial vs. authentic food samples has not been demonstrated. In the clinical field, the use of noncommutable PT samples has led to erroneous evaluation of the performances when different analytical methods were used. This study aimed to provide a first assessment of the <b>commutability</b> of samples distributed in food microbiology PT. Methods and Results : REQUASUD and IPH organized 13 food microbiology PTs including 10 – 28 participants. Three types of PT items were used: genuine food samples, sterile food samples and reference materials. The <b>commutability</b> of the artificial samples (reference material or sterile samples) was assessed by plotting the distribution of the results on natural and artificial PT samples. This comparison highlighted matrix-correlated issues when nonfood matrices, such as reference materials, were used. Artificially inoculated food samples, on the other hand, raised only isolated <b>commutability</b> issues. Conclusions : In the organization of a PT-scheme, authentic or artificially inoculated food samples are necessary to accurately evaluate the analytical performances. Reference materials, used as PT items because of their convenience, may present <b>commutability</b> issues leading to inaccurate penalizing conclusions for methods that would have provided accurate results on food samples.

40|$|Background: Results from {{external}} quality assessment schemes (EQASs) can {{provide information about}} accuracy and comparability of different measurement methods, provided that the material used in these schemes behave identical to patient samples among the different methods, a characteristic also known as <b>commutability.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the <b>commutability</b> of different matrices for the material used in an EQAS for tobramycin. Methods: Proficiency testing material (PTM) and patient samples containing tobramycin were prepared, collected, pooled, and distributed to participating laboratories for analysis. Low, medium, and high tobramycin concentrations in liquid human, liquid bovine and lyophilized bovine serum were tested in this study. The patient serum results of every laboratory were plotted against each of the other laboratories, and the distances of the PTM results to the patient serum regression line were calculated. For comparison, these distances were divided by the average within-laboratory standard deviation (SDwl) of the results reported in the official EQAS for tobramycin, resulting in a relative residual. The <b>commutability</b> decision limit was set at 3 SDwl. Results: With 10 laboratories participating in this study, 45 laboratory couples were formed. For human serum, only one relative residual for high concentrations of tobramycin was found outside the <b>commutability</b> decision limit. For liquid and lyophilized bovine sera, the number of relative residuals outside the decision limit was between 15 and 18 for low, medium, and high tobramycin concentrations.

It consists therefore of a normalization of contractual relations which ceases to be purely subjective. This finding leads to several inferences: the addition of the circumstances of the execution and termination of the contract, rather than simply its creation, to the possibilities of judicial review, a better legitimization of such review and the recognition of the principle of good faith as a privileged instrument for a fairer contractual <b>commutability.</b> Moreover, the last part of our thesis is devoted to examining judicial practice interventions based on good faith in order to illustrate the principles expressed in the study...|$|E

During {{the production of}} the certified reference material ERM-DA 470 k/IFCC discrepant measurement results were also found for ceruloplasmin measured with different methods, and consequently the protein could not be certified in the material. METHODS: We performed a <b>commutability</b> study with 30 serum samples and the reference materials ERMDA 470, ERM-DA 470 k/IFCC, and ERM-DA 472 /IFCC, using 6 different methods. Data were analyzed according to the CLSI Guideline C 53 -A to assess whether the reference materials had the same behavior as the serum samples with respect to measurement results obtained with combinations of the methods used. RESULTS: Measurement results from different methods showed a good linear correlation for the serum samples. ERM-DA 470 showed marked noncommutability for certain combinations of methods. ERMDA 470 k/IFCC and ERM-DA 472 /IFCC were commutable for more combinations of methods. The lack of <b>commutability</b> of ERM-DA 470 for certain combinations of methods correlates with results from the UK National External Quality Assessment Service showing discrepancies between results from these methods. For serum stored in the presence of sodium azide the results from different methods are essentially equivalent. CONCLUSIONS: Ceruloplasmin in ERM-DA 470 is a fully documented example of a situation in which, due to lack of <b>commutability,</b> the use of a common material for calibration did not lead to harmonization.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{consider}} general obstacles to {{the recovery of}} a causal system from its probability distribution. I argue {{that most of the}} well-known problems with this task belong in the class of what I call degenerate causal systems. I then consider the task of discovering causality of dynamic systems that have passed through one or more equilibrium points, and show that these systems present a challenge to causal discovery that is fundamentally different from degeneracy. To make this comparison, I consider two operators that are used to transform causal models. The first is the well-known Do operator for modeling manipulation, and the second is the Equilibration operator for modeling a dynamic system that has achieved equilibrium. I consider a set of questions regarding the <b>commutability</b> of these operators i. e., whether or not an equilibrated-manipulated model is necessarily equal to the corresponding manipulated-equilibrated model, and I explore the implications of that <b>commutability</b> on the practice of causal discovery. I provide empirical results showing that (a) these two operators sometimes, but not always, commute, and (b) the manipulatedequilibrated model is the correct one under a common interpretation of manipulation on dynamic systems.

Variability in measured Aβ 42 concentrations at different laboratories may be overcome by standardization and establishing traceability to a reference system. Candidate certified reference materials (CRMs) are validated herein for this purpose. Methods <b>Commutability</b> of 16 candidate CRM formats was assessed across five CSF Aβ 42 immunoassays and one mass spectrometry (MS) method {{in a set of}} 48 individual clinical CSF samples. Promising candidate CRM formats (neat CSF and CSF spiked with Aβ 42) were identified and subjected to validation across eight (Elecsys, EUROIMMUN, IBL, INNO-BIA AlzBio 3, INNOTEST, MSD, Simoa, and Saladax) immunoassays and the MS method in 32 individual CSF samples. <b>Commutability</b> was evaluated by Passing-Bablok regression and the candidate CRM termed commutable when found within the prediction interval (PI). The relative distance to the regression line wa assessed. Results The neat CSF candidate CRM format was commutable for almost all method comparisons, except for the Simoa/MSD, Simoa/MS and MS/IBL where it was found just outside the 95 % PI. However, the neat CSF was found within 5 % relative distance to the regression line for MS/IBL, between 5 - 10 % for Simoa/MS and between 10 - 15 % for Simoa/MSD comparisons. Conclusions The neat CSF candidate CRM format was commutable for 33 of 36 method comparisons, onlyone comparison more than expected given the 95 % PI acceptance limit.

The Michaelis constants (Km) for the preparations from liver, bone, and intestine agreed {{well with the}} Km values we obtained for five human serum specimens, whereas that for the placental isoenzyme differed significantly. The first three isoenzymes exhibited nearly identical response-surface patterns, which closely paralleled those observed for 12 human serum specimens (<b>commutability),</b> but not that of the placental isoenzyme. Thus, we believe that a reference material could equally well consist of either the bone, intestinal, or liver isoenzyme. All four isoenzymes were satisfactorily stable in temperature-accelerated degradation studies.

Some topological properties of the hyperspaces (M, O) with Tychonoff-type topologies O are briefly discussed. 1...|$|E

The film appears to depart from Michel Chion's model of the historical absence of specific accents in French cinema. However, by charting the process through which the central duo achieve and then exercise joint mastery of communication, their use of language will be shown to support the argument made most explicitly by Susan Purdie: that wit laughs not at any speaker so much as at language itself. In this way, the dialogue works to elide regional specificity and stresses characters' sameness, using humour to draw the spectator into the same collusively generated interpretation. By illustrating the fundamental <b>commutability</b> of linguistic constructs, and thus cultural perspectives, the film's verbal exchanges, like its narrative as a whole, ultimately speak less of regional difference than assimilation, and so contribute to notions of both nationhood and common humanity...|$|E
40|$|In any {{realistic}} quantum metrology scenarios, {{the ultimate}} precision in {{the estimation of}} parameters is limited {{not only by the}} so-called Heisenberg scaling, but also the environmental noise encountered by the underlying system. In the context of quantum estimation theory, it is of great significance to carefully evaluate the impact of a specific type of noise on the corresponding quantum Fisher information (QFI) or quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM). Here we investigate the multiple phase estimation problem for a natural parametrization of arbitrary pure states under white noise. We obtain the explicit expression of the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and hence the analytical formula of QFIM. Moreover, the attainability of the quantum Cramér-Rao bound (QCRB) is confirmed by the <b>commutability</b> of SLDs and the optimal estimators are elucidated for the experimental purpose. These findings generalize previously known partial results and highlight the role of white noise in quantum metrology. Comment: 5 pages and no figures. Any comments are welcome...|$|E
