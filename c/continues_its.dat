5|$|Fordham's {{medical school}} officially closed in 1919, and its College of Pharmacy {{followed}} suit in 1972. Nevertheless, the university <b>continues</b> <b>its</b> tradition of medical education through a {{collaboration with the}} Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University. The partnership allows Fordham undergraduate and graduate science students to take classes, conduct research, and pursue early admission to select programs of Einstein. In addition, it involves a physician mentoring program, which permits students to shadow an attending physician at Einstein's Montefiore Medical Center.|$|E
5|$|Guilty Gear X <b>continues</b> <b>its</b> predecessor's {{timeline}} {{with new}} characters and gameplay features. Still a four-button game, its instant-kill techniques were weakened and a survival mode {{was added to}} the previous game's three modes. The Dreamcast and PS2 versions have sold over 100,000 copies in Japan; they have been praised for their graphics, controls and characters but criticized for their lack of replay value. The GBA version was the poorest-received, with the main complaints concerning ease and graphics.|$|E

Now {{known as the}} Grand Ledge Highway, M-43 <b>continues</b> <b>its</b> easterly path across northern Eaton County before dipping south briefly to travel around {{the south side of}} Grand Ledge. Just south of town, M-43 has a junction with M-100 and then follows Saginaw Highway. The highway then has a junction with I-96/I-69 in Delta Township before continuing into Lansing, merged with BL I-69.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{north from}} Perry City, NY227 {{straddles}} the SchuylerTompkins county line, with the northbound lane in Tompkins County. After , NY227 turns northeastward, leaving {{the border and}} completely entering Tompkins County {{in the town of}} Ulysses. Here, directional signage along the route switches from east–west to north–south. The backdrop remains rural for another mile to an intersection with Mayo Road, where the land surrounding the highway begins to become more populated. NY227 <b>continues</b> <b>its</b> northeastern progression into the village of Trumansburg, initially passing the local golf course and intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR149 (Searsburg Road). The area around the road becomes primarily residential, a trend that follows the route to its northern end at a junction with NY96 (West Main Street) in downtown Trumansburg.|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{the state}} line north of Toledo, Ohio, I-75 enters Michigan in Monroe County {{carrying}} the Lake Erie Circle Tour (LECT) near the North Maumee Bay of Lake Erie. The freeway runs parallel to the shoreline of the Great Lake and past the community of Luna Pier. Further north, I-75 passes to the southeast of Monroe and crosses the River Raisin between {{the city and the}} river mouth. North of the river, the freeway turns further inland running through farmland. Near Newport, I-275 splits off to the northwest and I-75 <b>continues</b> <b>its</b> northeasterly trek through Monroe County. When it crosses the Huron River, the trunkline enters Wayne County between South Rockwood and Rockwood.|$|E

5|$|M-50 <b>continues</b> <b>its</b> {{journey through}} Jackson County, winding {{its way to}} the {{southeast}} through rural fields and small forests. The landscape transitions to residential neighborhoods as the road approaches the US127 freeway north of Jackson. In Blackman Township, M-50 merges with US127 to run concurrently into the north side of Jackson. After an interchange with I-94 at exit138, US127 exits to run east on I-94 for , M-50 and Business US127 (Bus. US127) run concurrently into the city as West Avenue passing by the Jackson Crossing shopping mall. The road then proceeds south through the northern side of the city before turning east on Michigan Avenue as it heads towards downtown.|$|E
5|$|Past the Cadillac area, M-115 {{runs through}} the northeastern corner of the Manistee National Forest. The highway {{continues}} through woodlands, passing several small lakes in the area as it approaches the community of Mesick. There it turns due west and joins M-37 through town. After M-37 separates to the south, M-115 crosses the Manistee River and <b>continues</b> <b>its</b> northwestern course. The highway crosses the northeastern corner of Manistee County and {{runs through the}} community of Copemish {{on the way to}} Benzonia. The landscape here turns more agricultural as the highway skirts southwest of Thompsonville crossing the Betsie River.|$|E
5|$|Red {{parasitic}} mites sometimes attach {{themselves to}} the dorsal region of crickets and may greatly affect them. The horsehair worm Paragordius varius is an internal parasite and can control the behaviour of its cricket host and cause it to enter water, where the parasite <b>continues</b> <b>its</b> lifecycle and the cricket likely drowns. The larvae of the sarcophagid fly Sarcophaga kellyi develop inside the body cavity of field crickets. Female parasitic wasps of Rhopalosoma lay their eggs on crickets, and their developing larvae gradually devour their hosts. Other wasps in the family Scelionidae are egg parasitoids, seeking out batches of eggs laid by crickets in plant tissues in which to insert their eggs.|$|E

5|$|The Engineers try to flee Site F, using Briggs and {{the hostages}} as human shields. Fisher, {{disguised}} as an Air Force hostage, helps Delta Force marksmen open fire on Sadiq and his men. Sadiq escapes on foot, and Fisher disarms and seriously wounds him. Sadiq boasts {{that he has}} already won; if he dies twelve nations supporting the Engineers will declare war on the U.S. {{and if he is}} tried, he will leak U.S. information. Although Fisher spares Sadiq, he detains him. President Caldwell publicly covers Sadiq's imprisonment by announcing his death, and the game ends as Fourth Echelon <b>continues</b> <b>its</b> operations; in a post-credits scene, a recovered Coste and Fisher prepare to interrogate Sadiq.|$|E
5|$|The grounds {{include a}} gorge {{cut by the}} Hazel Brook through Bristol's limestone. The gorge {{has a number of}} {{landscape}} features, including Goram's Chair, a limestone outcrop often used by climbers, and Lover's Leap and Potter's Point, two panoramic viewing spots. Stratford Mill was moved from West Harptree and re-erected within the gorge after Chew Valley Lake was flooded to form a reservoir. Ongoing renovations started in 2004 of the mill, settling ponds and associated estate pathways. At the gorge's southern end, Hazel Brook joins the River Trym, which <b>continues</b> <b>its</b> flow towards Sea Mills. Other features within the estate include two pools: the Giant's Soapdish and the Penny Well, and two caves: the Robber's Cave and the Butcher's Cave.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the river is in the Mourne Mountains {{on the slopes of}} Ott Mountain. The river then flows in a northerly {{direction}} into Fofanny Dam. It <b>continues</b> <b>its</b> flow in a north-easterly direction into Tollymore Forest Park where the tributaries Spinkwee and Trassey rivers join it. The Shimna finally flows to the east, then takes a south easterly direction toward Newcastle where at one point it flows through Tipperary Wood. The final tributaries to join the river prior to it reaching the sea are the Burren River and the Tullybrannigan River, at Islands Park. Near the mouth, as it flows through Castle Park, it widens quite considerably to create a shallow boating pond. The river's geology, flora and fauna have made it an Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI).|$|E

5|$|CR149 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY52 {{in the community}} of Youngsville. The route progresses northward, passing and paralleling Tremper Road, a dead-end road. CR149 passes by several residential homes in Youngsville, along with one local commercial building. After leaving the community, CR149 continues to the north as Shandelee Road, passing through the residential surroundings. After passing by a few more residences, Shandelee Road makes a bend to the northwest, and into more dense woodlands in the area. About a mile north of Youngsville, CR149 <b>continues</b> <b>its</b> way northward, passing by a local residence, and intersects with Stump Pond Road, which heads westward from the main highway. Shandalee Road makes another bend, this time to the north, passing through moderate development for about another mile. A short distance into the bend, the woodlands that were surrounding the highway clear and the highway becomes surrounded by fields and residential homes.|$|E
5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where wrap-around projection is used, each robotic arm <b>continues</b> <b>its</b> steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling {{at exactly the same}} pace. Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when in front of each ride bench its edges cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|E
5|$|Zelenin and Jimenez {{respectively}} {{side with}} Law and Chaos, while a resurrected Gore becomes Neutral. Depending on the choices {{made during the}} game, the protagonist has the choice of allying with either Law, Chaos or following a Neutral route and continuing with the original mission. If he sides with Law, the protagonist and Zelenin defeat both Jimenez and Mem Aleph before using the Cosmic Eggs to create a World of Law, with Zelenin worshiped as a channel to God for humanity, which is forced to surrender its free will. If he sides with Chaos, he and Jimenez help Mem Aleph and defeat Zelenin, using the Eggs to fulfill the Schwarzwelt's original purpose and create a world where humans and demons live together in a primal world where only the strong survive. In both the Law and Chaos routes, Arthur chooses to destroy his new personality to save the protagonist after the Red Sprite is damaged by Gore. If the protagonist rejects Law and Chaos, Gore transmits the necessary information {{for the destruction of}} the Schwarzwelt to him before truly passing on. After defeating Zelenin, Jimenez, and Mem Aleph, the protagonist and surviving crew escape in the Red Sprite while Arthur sacrifices himself to ensure the destruction of the Schwarzwelt, although there is a chance of it reappearing if humanity <b>continues</b> <b>its</b> abuse of the Earth.|$|E
