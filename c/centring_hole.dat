40|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steel cylinders and rings are spray water quenched to create residual stresses at {{or greater than}} the yield strength. The residual stresses are measured using neutron diffraction, and two mechanical strain relaxation methods: deep hole drilling and incremental <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> drilling. This paper compares the measurements with predictions of quenching using finite element analysis. Also finite element analysis is used to mimic deep <b>hole</b> and incremental <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> drilling methods and to reconstruct residual stresses {{as if they have}} been measured. The measurements reveal similar trends to the predictions but there is only limited agreement between their magnitudes. However, there is better agreement between the reconstructed stresses and the measurements. Both the two mechanical strain relaxation methods reveal that large discrepancies occur between measurements and predictions arise because of plasticity. Irrespective of this and surprisingly there is good agreement between deep hole drilling and neutron diffraction measurements...|$|R

50|$|Deep hole {{drilling}} (DHD) is a residual stress measurement technique {{used to measure}} locked-in and applied stresses in engineering materials and components. DHD is a semi-destructive mechanical strain relaxation (MSR) technique, which seeks to measure the distribution of stresses along the axis of a drilled reference hole. The process is unique {{in its ability to}} measure residual stresses at a microscopic level with a penetration of over 750 mm, without total destruction of the original component. DHD is considered deep in comparison to other {{hole drilling}} techniques such as <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> drilling.|$|R
50|$|For example, a beam {{component}} was plastically bent {{to introduce}} a known residual stress profile. These residual stresses were then measured using multiple residual stress measurement techniques including Neutron Diffraction, Slitting, Ring Core, Incremental <b>Centre</b> <b>Hole</b> Drilling, Deep Hole Drilling and Incremental Deep Hole Drilling, as well as modelled with finite element software to provide further numerical validation. The correlation between the results from techniques is strong, with DHD and iDHD displaying the same trend and magnitudes as both the numerical simulation and the other experimental techniques. The results from this comparison are shown in the Figure.|$|R

Shrink-fitted assemblies using stainless steel and cast iron were manufactured and residual stresses measured {{using a combination of}} deep <b>hole</b> and <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> drilling. The results from the finite element simulations demonstrated that modifications to the deep hole drilling method were required to account for plastic relaxation during the measurement process.

5000|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint, a 3-inch CD follows the Red Book standard for CD digital audio. The major {{difference is that}} the smaller physical size of the disc allows for fewer data sectors, meaning the disc can store less audio.

Some slot-loading drives, such as those found in some car CD players, are unable to manipulate the smaller discs or their adapters.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} near to {{the surface}} and bulk residual stress distributions in a new rail measured by using an integrated incremental centre-deep hole drilling technique. It was found that the incremental <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> drilling and deep hole drilling worked well as complementary techniques. The residual stresses measured by using the integrated drilling technique were compared with residual stresses measured by neutron diffraction and the two sets of results were found to be in good agreement. Particularly, a very good match was seen in the web, where the effect of cutting the rail for ND measurements was the lowest. As it can be applied to an uncut rail, the integrated incremental centre-deep hole drilling technique is better suited for residual stress measurement in rails...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{measured and}} predicted residual stresses from {{two sets of}} shrinkfitted assemblies, each manufactured using an aluminium alloy and a cast iron. Residual stresses were measured {{using a combination of}} deep-hole drilling (DHD) and incremental <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> drilling (ICHD) techniques. The ICHD method provided near surface residual stress measurements to depths up to about 1 mm. The DHD method measured through thickness residual stresses along radial lines through the outer sleeve and into the shaft. Results are shown for the two assemblies and reveal residual stresses that are different from both simple analysis and finite element studies. For example, prior machining introduced near surface compressive residual stresses, that is then expected to be counteracted by the near surface tensile shrink-fit residual stresses. However, measurements reveal {{that this is not the}} case. 1...|$|R

50|$|Early columns were {{constructed}} of stone, some {{out of a}} single piece of stone. Monolithic columns are among the heaviest stones used in architecture. Other stone columns are created out of multiple sections of stone, mortared or dry-fit together. In many classical sites, sectioned columns were carved with a <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> or depression so that they could be pegged together, using stone or metal pins. The design of most classical columns incorporates entasis (the inclusion of a slight outward curve in the sides) plus a reduction in diameter along the height of the column, so that the top is as little as 83% of the bottom diameter. This reduction mimics the parallax effects which the eye expects to see, and tends to make columns look taller and straighter than they are while entasis adds to that effect.|$|R

This thesis {{describes}} the design, construction and calibration {{of an air}} abrasive <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> (AACH) residual stress measuring facility {{as well as its}} use in an experimental study of residual stresses developed in extruded high strength aluminium drill rods. These drill rods were manufactured by Hulett Aluminium for the mining industry for surface drilling exploration work. Initially a review of available residual stress measurement techniques was undertaken to establish which technique was the most suitable, particularly for residual stress measurement in aluminium rods as a function of processing route, and preferably with the advantages of being reliable, easy to perform, and nominally portable. Furthermore, it was required to establish a residual stress measurement technique which would be well suited for incorporation into the production line of the extruded aluminium drill rods...|$|R

Then a standard V-shaped fillet was made on one edge of the plates. Two plates were butt-welded by standard metal arc gas (MAG) welding process. Residual stresses induced by welding were measured on 20 specimens by <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> drilling. Load controlled axial fatigue tests were carried out to determine the fatigue life of specimens. Crack growth rates were obtained from experiment. Fractography of specimens was performed. Genetic Algorithm (GA) was employed for prediction of residual stress value in weldments using the crack growth rates obtained from experiments. The results show that, by using the measured crack growth rates and GA model, residual stresses can be estimated with a good approximation. 1...|$|R

30|$|The {{action of}} X-ray {{irradiation}} on glasses {{is to produce}} secondary electrons from the sites where {{they are in a}} stable state and have an excess energy. Such electrons may traverse in the glass network depending upon their energy and the composition of the glass and are finally trapped, thus forming colour centres (or alternatively they may form excitons with energy states in the forbidden gap). The trapping sites may be the neodymium ions which constitute the glass structure, ions of admixtures to the main composition and the structural defects due to impurities in the glass. Thus this process leads to the formation of (1) boron electron centres, (2) non-bridging oxygen <b>hole</b> <b>centres</b> and (3) boron oxygen <b>hole</b> <b>centres</b> [35, 36, 37]. Thermoluminescence is a consequence of radiative recombination between the electrons (released by heating from electron centre) and an anti-bonding molecular orbital of the nearest of the oxygen <b>hole</b> <b>centres.</b> The observed TL peaks in the present glasses can be attributed due to such radiation.|$|R
40|$|Dissimilar metal welds are {{necessary}} in high-pressure subsea systems and {{in cases where}} forged components must be welded to pipelines. F 22 (2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo) steel is often used in such forged steel components and, since this steel cannot enter service without undergoing post-weld heat treatment (PWHT), the components are usually prepared for field welds {{through the application of}} a buttering layer. Furthermore, a weld overlay is deposited for the purpose of mitigating corrosion. This combination of multiple welding tasks and dissimilar materials leads to the possibility of developing substantial residual stresses. This study aims to provide insights to the evolution of residual stresses at each stage of the welding operation. The assessment has been undertaken on laboratory-scale weld mock-ups using the contour method for residual stress measurement, and incremental <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> drilling. It was found that both buttering and cladding introduce near-yield levels of tensile residual stresses, but that these stresses are successfully relieved upon PWHT...|$|R
