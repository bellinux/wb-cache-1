25|$|Since the <b>characteristic</b> <b>function</b> of a {{convolution}} is {{the product}} of the characteristic functions of the densities involved, the central limit theorem has yet another restatement: the product of the characteristic functions of a number of density functions becomes close to the <b>characteristic</b> <b>function</b> of the normal density as the number of density functions increases without bound, under the conditions stated above. Specifically, an appropriate scaling factor needs to be applied to the argument of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of wave {{propagation}} on a manifold X, the <b>characteristic</b> <b>functions</b> are real valued functions on cotangent bundle of X that specify the allowable phase velocities of the waves. For certain classes of differential operators (e. g Maxwell's Equations) the associated <b>characteristic</b> <b>functions</b> have singularities. These singularities account for phenomena like conical refraction and the transformation of longitudinal waves into transversal ones (or viceversa). For a specific class of differential operators on surface, we prove that the singularities of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>functions</b> can be accounted from purely topological considerations. We also prove {{that there is a}} natural way to desingularsize the <b>characteristic</b> <b>functions,</b> and observe that this fact and Morse Theory establishes a specific connection between singularities and critical points of these functions.

25|$|In {{probability}} theory and statistics, the <b>characteristic</b> <b>function</b> of any real-valued random variable completely defines its probability distribution. If a random variable admits a probability density function, then the <b>characteristic</b> <b>function</b> is the Fourier transform of the probability density function.

There are particularly simple results for the characteristic functions of distributions defined by the weighted sums of random variables.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there is}} a {{one-to-one}} correspondence between cumulative distribution functions and characteristic functions, it is always possible to find one of these functions if we know the other one. The formula in definition of <b>characteristic</b> <b>function</b> allows us to compute φ when we know the distribution function F (or density f).

Such generalized <b>characteristic</b> <b>functions</b> can be applied when the earnings or costs of cooperation among a set of players depend on {{the order in which}} the players enter a coalition. In the literature, the two main solutions for generalized <b>characteristic</b> <b>functions</b> are the one of Nowak and Radzik (1994), shortly called NR-value, and the one introduced by Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997), shortly called SB-value. In this paper, we introduce the axiom of order monotonicity with respect to the order of the players in a unanimity coalition, requiring that players who enter earlier should get not more in the corresponding (ordered) unanimity game than players who enter later. We propose several classes of order monotonic solutions for generalized <b>characteristic</b> <b>functions</b> that contain the NR-value and SB-value as special (extreme) cases.
