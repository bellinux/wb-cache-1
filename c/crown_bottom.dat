50|$|The former Lodge's {{supermarket}} {{building had}} been sitting empty {{in the heart of}} the town since the Co-op moved to new premises in <b>Crown</b> <b>Bottom.</b> Lodge's was built in the 1970s by the prominent local grocery company. It was opened by Radio 1 DJ Tony Blackburn and occupied an unusual location over the River Holme beside the town's small bus station. Lodge's was bought in the 1990s by Co-operative Retail Services who eventually closed the store down in 1997, after investing in a brand new £2 million supermarket for the town. Local residents, led by the Holme Valley Business Association, campaigned for its demolition. Their campaign was featured in the 2005 Channel 4 documentary, Demolition. The building has since undergone extensive modernisation into several smaller shops, with some accommodation on the top floor.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the causes}} {{determining}} the radial pattern of sap flux density is important both for improving knowledge of sapwood functioning and for up-scaling sap flow measurements to canopy transpiration and ecosystem water use.

50|$|Symptoms {{and signs}} of fungus disease are often found underground. The H. annosum infections cause an {{abnormal}} change in structure in the roots that climbs up to {{the butt of the}} tree. More than half the tree may be killed before any symptoms appear to the human eye. Basidiocarps can take up to one and a half or even three years to be visible. This infections causes the trees to have abnormal needle growth, pale yellow barks, and the trees to wither and die. This root disease typically causes the tree to have a thin <b>crown</b> from <b>bottom</b> up and inside out. Trees will eventually die. A landscape scale symptom is the rings of dead trees in various stages of decay and death, with the oldest at the center and progressively younger moving outward. The white rot fungus found in the roots is the sign of telling whether the tree has been affected by H. annosum. The bark changes colors as the stages progress, they go from pale yellow, to a crusty light brown, and finally in its advanced stage it turns white with the signature of Fomes annosus ― a sprinkled streak of black spots. Another sign is the leaking part of the root that causes a compact mass to form between it and the sand.|$|R

A total of 1596 trees growing in 209 stands distributed in six countries, from Mediterranean to boreal sites, were sampled. This paper shows the applicability of the ChlF in forest ecology surveys, the protocols adopted for leaf sampling and ChlF measurements, the variability of the ChlF parameters within and between trees, their dependence to environmental factors and the relationships with other functional leaf traits. The most relevant findings were as follows: (i) The least variable ChlF parameter within and between the trees was the maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry (F V /F M), whereas the performance indices (PI ABS and PI TOT) showed the highest variability; (ii) for a given tree, the ChlF parameters measured at two heights of the <b>crown</b> (top and <b>bottom</b> leaves) were correlated and, in coniferous species, the ChlF parameters were correlated between different needle age classes (from the current year and previous year); (iii) the ChlF parameters showed a geographical pattern, and the photochemical performance of the forest trees was higher in central Europe than in the edge sites (northernmost and southernmost); and (iv) ChlF parameters showed different sensitivity to specific environmental factors: F V /F M increased with the increase of the leaf area index of stands and soil fertility; ΔV IP was reduced under high temperature and drought. The photochemical responses of forest tree species, analyzed with ChlF parameters, were influenced by the ecology of the trees (i. e. their functional groups, continental distribution, successional status, etc.), tree species’ richness and composition of the stands. Our results support the applicability and usefulness of the ChlF in forest monitoring investigations on a large spatial scale and its possibility of being integrated with remote sensing surveys...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have been}} {{thinking}} {{a good deal about}} plays lately, and I have been wondering why I dislike the clear and logical construction which seems necessary if one is to succeed on the Modern Stage. It came into my head the other day that this construction, which all the world has learnt from France, has everything of high literature except the emotion of multitude. The Greek drama has got the emotion of multitude from its chorus, which called up famous sorrows, long-leaguered Troy, much-enduring Odysseus, and all the gods and heroes to witness, as it were, some well-ordered fable, some action separated but for this from all but itself. The French play delights in the well-ordered fable, but by leaving out the chorus it has created an art where poetry and imagination, always the children of far-off multitudinous things, must of necessity grow less important than the mere will. This is why, I said to myself, French dramatic poetry is so often a little rhetorical, for rhetoric is the will trying to do the work of the imagination. The Shakespearean Drama gets the emotion of multitude out of the sub-plot which copies the main plot, much as a shadow upon the wall copies one's body in the firelight. We think of King Lear less as the history of one man and his sorrows than as the history of a whole evil time. Lear's shadow is in Gloster, who also has ungrateful children, and the mind goes on imagining other shadows, shadow beyond shadow till it has pictured the world. In Hamlet, one hardly notices, so subtly is the web woven, that the murder of Hamlet's father and the sorrow of Hamlet are shadowed in the lives of Fortinbras and Ophelia and Laertes, whose fathers, too, have been killed. It is so in all the plays, or in all but all, and very commonly the sub-plot is the main plot working itself out in more ordinary men and women, and so doubly calling up before us the image of multitude. Ibsen and Maeterlinck have on the other hand created a new form, for they get multitude from the Wild Duck in the Attic, or from the <b>Crown</b> at the <b>bottom</b> of the Fountain, vague symbols that set the mind wandering from idea to idea, emotion to emotion. Indeed all the great Masters have understood, that there cannot be great art without the little limited life of the fable, which is always the better the simpler it is, and the rich, far-wandering, many-imaged life of the half-seen world beyond it. There are some who understand that the simple unmysterious things living as in a clear noon-light are {{of the nature of the}} sun, and that vague many-imaged things have in them the strength of the moon. Did not the Egyptian carve it on emerald that all living things have the sun for father and the moon for mother, and has it not been said that a man of genius takes the most after his mother? ...|$|R
40|$|In recent past, tunnel constructions in Japan have {{increased}} mainly {{due to the}} construction of revival road network in Tohoku region in northern part of Honshu Island. Many of the mountainous tunnels constructed in this area utilize New Austrian Tunneling method which has a superior versatility and low initial cost compared to many of other methods. These tunnels are comprised of a double shell lining system. The Inner lining is constructed with shotcrete and the outer lining, which is visible, is made of reinforced or unreinforced concrete. Cracking of the outer, second, lining has become a major concern for tunnel construction specialists as cracking poses a great threat for long term durability. Three types of cracks were apparent from the tunnel inspection data. The first type of cracks referred to type 1 cracks in this research are the cracks which propagate parallel to the crown line close to the crown region. The second type of cracks type 2 cracks are the vertical cracks starting from the horizontal construction joint between the invert and second lining. The third type of cracks, type 3, are the horizontal cracks starting from vertical construction joint between two lining blocks. It had been observed that the mechanism of type 1 cracking was not properly understood because the stress of crown of the second lining could vary based on many variables such as self-weight, volume changes of concrete, hydration heat, shrinkage, restraint conditions of joints etc. Regarding type 2 cracks, the cause of the cracking was hypothesized as the restraint from invert for volume change of concrete in the second lining. However, further clarification of behaviour of type 2 cracks was required to investigate the potential crack mitigation techniques. Three objectives were set for this study. The first objective was to establish appropriate finite element modeling schemes to study stresses generated in the second lining concrete of NATM tunnels mainly caused by short-term thermal movements due to hydration heat and by long-term drying shrinkage. The second objective was to clarify the mechanism of crown stress behaviour as it was crucial to investigate crack mitigation methods at the crown. The third objective was to propose recommendations to mitigate cracking at critical locations. Critical locations considered here included the crown area with high transverse stress and areas of the second lining close to the invert with higher longitudinal stress. The study was carried out for short-term stress behaviour of second lining governed by thermal stress and for long-term stress behaviour of second lining governed by drying shrinkage. The finite element model of the tunnel was calibrated and sufficiently validated using tunnel field measurement data and proper engineering judgement with observed practical evidence. Validated models were utilized for parametric studies to investigate the stress behaviour at the <b>crown</b> and the <b>bottom</b> of the second lining close to invert. Two finite element modeling tools were utilized considering the different capabilities of software in different aspects. Major finite element package used is known as ASTEA-MACS, which is a well-known software in Japan for thermal stress analysis. This software provides a great flexibility to execute parametric studies. The other software is called LINK 3 D, that is, an integrated system which is capable of simulating the combined effects of microscopic material behaviour and nonlinear structural behaviour of concrete structures. Because of the integrated multiscale concrete simulation model in the software LINK 3 D is capable of predicting drying shrinkage with respect to varying environmental conditions, structural geometry and so on. First, finite element modeling was carried out considering the short term stress behaviour of second lining with respect to field measurements. The joint formed by waterproofing sheet and the vertical construction joint in between second lining blocks were modeled with negligible joint strength in shear and in tension where the normal compressive strength was assumed to be non-negligible. The joint between the second lining and invert was modeled with fixed joint conditions. The form removal mechanism was assumed to be equal to the application of gravity load at the time of form removal. Special attention was given in determining the thermal properties of composite waterproofing sheet. The thermal conductivity of the waterproofing sheet was calculated based on previous studies done on geotextiles assuming steady state conditions. It was observed that the established model could simulate the temperature in the second lining and stresses in an acceptable manner. Then to analyze the long-term behaviour of the second lining governed by drying shrinkage, a calculation method was proposed by combining LINK 3 D and ASTEA-MACS software. The free drying shrinkage strain calculated by LINK 3 D was used as an input to ASTEA-MACS to carry out the stress analysis. Considering the stress distribution of the stress in the thickness direction at the crown and close to the invert in the calibrated model, it was observed that the crown cracks can be non-penetrating cracks while the cracks close to invert can be penetrating cracks. From the short term simulation results, the mechanism of crown stress variation was clarified. It could be seen that before the form removal the crown stress was governed only by temperature rise and capability of the free movement due to the existence of air void. After the form removal up to a short time, stress behaviour of the crown was governed by self-weight, temperature decrease rate difference in the thickness direction and the deformation behaviour of second lining at the crown. From the parametric study for short term behaviour, it was observed that crown transverse stress was sensitive to prolonged form retention which could cause external restraint. To obtain the advantages of longer form retention, proper care should be taken {{to make sure that the}} contraction of the second lining is not inadequately restrained. Among the investigated material properties, the coefficient of thermal expansion and autogenous shrinkage had a considerable influence on the longitudinal stress near invert. It was observed that low temperature concreting might be helpful in reducing the invert longitudinal stress but might not affect the crown transverse stress so much. In the current study expansive additive was observed to be effective in controlling the stresses close to the invert but it might be necessary to be further investigated considering the tensile strength of expansive concrete which was not considered in this study. It could be observed that the tensile stress near the surface at crown was small compared to the tensile strength without considering drying shrinkage. This depicts that the crown cracking might not be generated only by thermal stress and self-weight. Therefore, proper construction and ensured material quality might be the key for preventing early age cracking near the crown. In terms of long-term stresses, drying shrinkage governs the stress at the crown. It was observed that shrinkage property of concrete had a considerable effect on crown stress level and should be taken into account carefully. It could be seen that the crown stress was not highly depended on the tunnel section size. Effect of other factors such as concrete creep, air temperature and humidity variation in the long term should be clarified in future to make an accurate conclusion regarding the belief about increased cracking risk in large blocks with evacuation spaces...|$|R
