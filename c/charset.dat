5|$|Beta-2 had two builds (beta-2a: 28 February 1996 and beta-2b: 21 March 1996) and {{introduced}} a new API for communicating with other applications. Also, the internal component libwww was updated to version 4. OMRON Corporation developed an internationalized version that could display Chinese, Korean and Japanese characters in one page. OMRON's Arena supports both ISO-2022 and Unicode. It is able to guess the <b>charset</b> parameter automatically if <b>charset</b> parameter isn't specified in Content-Type field.|$|E
25|$|With HTML {{up to and}} {{including}} HTML 4.01 and XHTML, there were four valid attributes: content, http-equiv, name and scheme. Under HTML 5 there are now five valid attributes, <b>charset</b> having been added. http-equiv is used to emulate an HTTP header, and name to embed metadata. The value of the statement, in either case, is contained in the content attribute, which is the only required attribute unless <b>charset</b> is given. <b>charset</b> is used to indicate the character set of the document, and is available in HTML5.|$|E
25|$|IANA has {{registered}} the <b>charset</b> names ISO_6937-2-25 and ISO_6937-2-add for two (older) {{versions of this}} standard (plus control codes). But in practice this character encoding is unused on the Internet.|$|E
50|$|Both SCSU and BOCU-1 are IANA {{registered}} <b>charsets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|UTF-1, the multi-byte Unicode {{transformation}} format {{compatible with}} ISO/IEC 2022, has various disadvantages {{in comparison with}} UTF-8, and switching from or to other <b>charsets,</b> as supported by ISO/IEC 2022, is typically unnecessary in Unicode documents.|$|R
50|$|In demoscene parlance, {{graphics}} or GFX typically only {{includes the}} work of the graphician - that is, still images, textures, <b>charsets</b> (short for character sets such as monospaced fonts), 3D scenes, 3D objects and color schemes. Effects and other code-related visualization is usually not regarded as graphics.|$|R
25|$|The English-based orthography {{commonly}} used in North America is, to a degree, an accommodation of the Pan-Vlax orthography to English-language keyboards, replacing those graphemes with diacritics with digraphs, such as the substitution of ts ch sh zh for c č š ž. This particular orthography seems to have arisen spontaneously as Romani speakers have communicated using email, a medium in which graphemes outside the Latin-1 <b>charset</b> have until recently been difficult to type. In addition, it is this orthography which is recommended for use by Romani scholar and activist Ronald Lee.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>charset</b> may be any {{character}} set registered with IANA. Typically {{it would be}} the same <b>charset</b> as the message body.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>charset</b> - C++ {{template}} {{library with}} simple interface to convert between C++\user-defined streams. <b>charset</b> defined many character-sets and {{allows you to}} use Unicode formats with support of endianness.|$|E
50|$|Each {{character}} takes 8 bytes {{of memory}} to store. In addition to <b>charsets,</b> the VIC-II also uses 1k for its screen memory ($400-$7EF being the default). Color RAM is at $D800-$DBFF and cannot be moved from that location. It contains the values for Color 1 of each character.|$|R
5000|$|For the IANA {{registered}} <b>charsets</b> UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE, a byte order mark {{should not}} be used because the names of these character sets already determine the byte order. If encountered anywhere in such a text stream, U+FEFF is to be interpreted as a [...] "zero width no-break space".|$|R
40|$|Several factors make text {{processing}} a complicated task. The diversity of languages, set of characters (<b>charsets),</b> algorithms, and techniques that a specific application may use, increase {{the complexity of}} the design and implementation of such applications. In this paper, we propose a pattern-oriented framework for {{text processing}} {{in an effort to make}} the design, the implementation, and the maintenance of text processing applications easier and more flexible. We go further to propose patterns to solve the problem of designing text summarization system...|$|R

50|$|Its {{development}} was initiated in the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow in 1982, and development continued in cooperation from other institutes, and commercialized by DEMOS Co-operative which employed most key contributors to DEMOS {{and to its}} earlier alternative, MNOS (a clone of Unix Version 6). MNOS and DEMOS version 1.x were gradually merged from 1986 until 1990, leaving the joint OS, DEMOS version 2.x, with support for different Cyrillic <b>charsets</b> (KOI-8 and U-code, used in DEMOS 1 and MNOS, respectively).|$|R
5000|$|Each part {{consists}} {{of its own}} content header (zero or more Content- header fields) and a body. Multipart content can be nested. The content-transfer-encoding of a multipart type must always be [...] "7bit", [...] "8bit" [...] or [...] "binary" [...] to avoid the complications that would be posed by multiple levels of decoding. The multipart block as a whole {{does not have a}} charset; non-ASCII characters in the part headers are handled by the Encoded-Word system, and the part bodies can have <b>charsets</b> specified if appropriate for their content-type.|$|R
5000|$|UTF-7 {{was first}} {{proposed}} as an experimental protocol in RFC 1642, A Mail-Safe Transformation Format of Unicode. This RFC {{has been made}} obsolete by RFC 2152, an informational RFC which never became a standard. As RFC 2152 clearly states, the RFC [...] "does not specify an Internet standard of any kind". Despite this, RFC 2152 is quoted as the definition of UTF-7 in the IANA's list of <b>charsets.</b> Neither is UTF-7 a Unicode Standard. The Unicode Standard 5.0 only lists UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32.There is also a modified version, specified in RFC 2060, which is sometimes identified as UTF-7.|$|R
50|$|Logical {{order for}} this <b>charset</b> {{requires}} bidi processing for display.|$|E
50|$|TIS-620 is the IANA {{preferred}} <b>charset</b> {{name for}} TIS-620, and that <b>charset</b> name is used also for ISO/IEC 8859-11 (which adds a no-break space character at 0xA0, which is unassigned in TIS-620). When the IANA name is used the codes are supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429.|$|E

50|$|When a {{document}} is received without any explicit {{indication of the}} character encoding, some applications use <b>charset</b> detection to attempt to guess what encoding was used.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{few cases}} where <b>charset</b> {{detection}} works reliably is detecting UTF-8. This {{is due to the}} large percentage of invalid byte sequences in UTF-8, so that text in any other encoding that uses bytes with the high bit set is extremely unlikely to pass a UTF-8 validity test. Unfortunately, badly written <b>charset</b> detection routines do not run the reliable UTF-8 test first, and may decide that UTF-8 is some other encoding. For example, it was common that web sites in UTF-8 containing the name of the German city München were shown as MÃ¼nchen.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{very common}} (on the Internet) to mislabel Windows-1252 text with the <b>charset</b> label ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by [...] "smart quotes" [...] in word-processing software) were {{replaced}} with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Most modern web browsers and e-mail clients treat the media type <b>charset</b> ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252 to accommodate such mislabeling. This is now standard behavior in the HTML5 specification, which requires that documents advertised as ISO-8859-1 actually be parsed with the Windows-1252 encoding.|$|E
