50|$|A {{centrifugal}} extractor—also {{known as}} a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactor</b> or annular centrifugal contactor—uses {{the rotation of the}} rotor inside a centrifuge to mix two immiscible liquids outside the rotor and to separate the liquids in the field of gravity inside the rotor. This way, a centrifugal extractor generates a continuous extraction from one liquid phase (fermentation broth) into another liquid phase (organic solvent).|$|E
50|$|Annular {{centrifugal}} extractor {{design and}} {{development has been}} pursued by various Department of Energy laboratories for more than 40 years. Initial design of the annular <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactor</b> was done at Argonne National Laboratory through modification of a Savannah River Site paddle mixed design. It has been employed in solvent extraction processes for metals valuable to the nuclear industry. A summary of contactor design principles and applications is included in a recent compilation.|$|E
50|$|Typically for solvent {{extraction}} processes in stage-wise {{equipment such as}} the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactor,</b> you would have multiple contactors in series for extraction, scrubbing, and stripping (and perhaps others). The number of stages needed in each section of the process would depend on process design requirements (necessary extraction factor). In the case in Fig. 6, four interconnected stages provide a continuous {{process in which the}} first stage is a decanting stage. The next two stages show a counter current extraction. The last stage is a neutralization as a cross stream interconnection.|$|E

40|$|The renewed {{interest}} in advancing nuclear energy has spawned the research of advanced technologies for recycling nuclear fuel. A {{significant portion of the}} advanced fuel cycle includes the recovery of selected actinides by solvent extraction methods utilizing <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactors.</b> Although the use of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactors</b> for solvent extraction is widely known, their operation is not without challenges. Solutions generated from spent fuel dissolution contain unknown quantities of undissolved solids. A majority of these solids will be removed via various methods of filtration. However, smaller particles are expected to carry through to downstream solvent extraction processes and equipment. In addition, solids/precipitates brought about by mechanical or chemical upsets are another potential area of concern. During processing, particulate captured in the rotor assembly by high centrifugal forces eventually forms a cake-like structure on the inner wall introducing balance problems and negatively affecting phase separations. One of the features recently developed for larger engineering scale Annular <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>Contactors</b> (ACCs) is the Clean-In-Place (CIP) capability. Engineered spray nozzles were installed into the hollow central rotor shaft in all four quadrants of the rotor assembly. This arrangement allows for a very convenient and effective method of solids removal from within the rotor assembly...|$|R
50|$|Two {{immiscible}} liquids {{of different}} densities are fed to the separate inlets and are rapidly mixed in the annular {{space between the}} spinning rotor and stationary housing. The mixed phases are directed {{toward the center of}} the rotor by radial vanes in the housing base. As the liquids enter the central opening of the rotor, they are accelerated toward the wall. The mixed phases are rapidly accelerated to rotor speed and separation begins as the liquids are displaced upward. A system of weirs at the top of the rotor allow each phase to exit the rotor where it lands in a collector ring and exits the stage. Flow from between stages is by gravity with no need for inter-stage pumps. The centrifugal contactors thus acts as a mixer, centrifuge and pump. Centrifugal contactors are typical referred to by the diameter of their rotor. Thus, a 5-inch <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactor</b> is one having a 5-inch diameter rotor.|$|E

40|$|The Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) {{process has}} been {{selected}} for the separation of cesium from Savannah River Site high-level waste. The solvent composition used in the CSSX process was recently optimized so that the solvent is no longer supersaturated {{with respect to the}} calixarene crown ether extractant. Hydraulic performance and mass transfer efficiency testing of a single stage of 5. 5 -cm ORNL-designed <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactor</b> has been performed for the CSSX process with the optimized solvent. Maximum throughputs of the 5. 5 -cm <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactor,</b> as a function of contactor rotor speed, have been measured for the extraction, scrub, strip, and wash sections of the CSSX flowsheet at the baseline organic/aqueous flow ratios (O/A) of the process, as well as at O/A’s 20 % higher and 20 % lower than the baseline. Maximum throughputs are comparable to the design throughput of the contactor, as well as with throughputs obtained previously in a 5 -cm <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactor</b> with the non-optimized CSSX solvent formulation. The 20 % variation in O/A had minimal effect on contactor throughput. Additionally, mass transfer efficiencies have been determined for the extraction and strip sections of the flowsheet. Efficiencies were lower than the process goal of {{greater than or equal to}} 80 %, ranging from 72 to 75 % for the extraction section and from 36 to 60 % in the strip section. Increasing the mixing intensity and/or the solution level in the mixing zone of the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactor</b> (residence time) could potentially increase efficiencies. Several methods are available to accomplish this including (1) increasing the size of the opening in the bottom of the rotor, resulting in a contactor which is partially pumping instead of fully pumping, (2) decreasing the number of vanes in the contactor, (3) increasing the vane height, or (4) adding vanes on the rotor and baffles on the housing of the contactor. The low efficiency results obtained stress the importance of proper design of a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactor</b> for use in the CSSX process.

40|$|Annular <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactors</b> (ACCs) {{are being}} {{evaluated}} for process-scale solvent extraction operations {{in support of}} Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) separations goals. Process-scale annular <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactors</b> {{have the potential for}} high stage efficiency if properly employed and optimized for the application. Hydraulic performance issues related to flow instability and classical flooding are likely unimportant, especially for units with high throughputs. However, annular mixing increases rapidly with increasing rotor diameter while maintaining a fixed g force at the rotor wall. In addition, for engineering/process-scale contactors, elevated rotor speeds and/or throughput rates, can lead to organic phase foaming at the rotor discharge collector area. Foam buildup in the upper rotor head area can aspirate additional vapor from the contactor housing resulting in a complete loss of separation equilibrium. Variable speed drives are thus desirable to optimize and balance the operating parameters to help ensure acceptable performance. Proper venting of larger contactors is required to balance pressures across individual stages and prevent vapor lock due to foam aspiration...|$|R

40|$|The TRUEX {{process is}} being {{evaluated}} at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) for {{the separation of}} the actinides from acidic radioactive wastes stored at the ICPP. These efforts have culminated in recent demonstrations of the TRUEX process with actual tank waste. The first demonstration was performed in 1996 using 24 stages of 2 -cm diameter <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactors</b> and waste from tank WM- 183. Based on the results of this flowsheet demonstration, the flowsheet was optimized and a second flowsheet demonstration was performed. This test also was performed using 2 -cm diameter <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactors</b> and waste from tank WM- 183. However, the total number of contactor stages was reduced from 24 to 20. Also, the concentration of HEDPA in the strip solution was reduced from 0. 04 M to 0. 01 M in order to minimize the amount of phosphate in the HLW fraction, which would be immobilized into a glass waste form. This flowsheet demonstration was performed using <b>centrifugal</b> <b>contactors</b> installed in the shielded hot cell at the ICPP Remote Analytical Laboratory. The flowsheet tested consisted of six extraction stages, four scrub stages, six strip stages, two solvent was stages, and two acid rinse stages.
