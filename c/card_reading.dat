For example, while the communication processor controlled <b>card</b> <b>reading</b> and punching, the main CPU executed calculations and binary branch instructions. One databus would bear data between the main CPU and core memory at the CPU's fetch-execute cycle rate, and other databusses would typically serve the peripheral devices. On the PDP-1, the core memory's cycle time was 5 microseconds; consequently most arithmetic instructions took 10 microseconds (100,000 operations per second) because most operations took {{at least two}} memory cycles; one for the instruction, one for the operand data fetch.|$|E

500|$|Martello later {{claimed to}} have {{experienced}} psychic phenomena as a child, sparking his interest in occultism. By his early teenage years, he had begun studying palmistry and tarot <b>card</b> <b>reading</b> with a Gypsy named Marta. He also later claimed {{that his father had}} informed him that his grandmother, Maria Concetta, had been a psychic known as a Strega Maga ("Great Witch") in her hometown of Enna, Sicily, Italy. According to Martello's account, Concetta had worked as a folk magician and tarot card reader, and attracted the hatred and envy of the local Catholic clergy. He also related that on one occasion, she had killed a Mafioso using magic when he threatened her husband for not paying protection money. Martello related that when he was 16, his father told him that he had cousins in New York City who wished to meet him. He proceeded to do so and [...] according to his account [...] they informed him that they were initiates of an ancient Italian witchcraft religion, La Vecchia ("the Old Religion"). After identifying his possession of psychic powers, they initiated him into the tradition on his 21st birthday in 1951, making him swear an oath never to reveal the secrets of the La Vecchia. Moving to the city, he studied at Hunter College and the Institute for Psychotherapy.|$|E
500|$|Police interrogated Garza at a San Antonio motel {{where he}} claimed to have a {{landscaping}} business in Mexico, though police suspected that he was a drug dealer. After further questioning, Garza admitted on March 31, 1993, he had made arrangements to have Fischer killed. He told the police he confessed because he was troubled by what he had done. He was not arrested immediately because investigators needed more information from him to continue with the case. He told investigators that it started when he visited a local fortune teller after he separated from his wife in 1992. The fortune teller, María Mercedes Martínez de Sánchez, consulted with Garza for several sessions in an attempt to repair the relationship he had with his wife. Garza's son was born with muscular dystrophy and his wife was depressed, to the point where she wanted to kill herself and their son. Investigators said that Garza believed his wife's relatives had cast a spell on their marriage and he needed Martínez's help. They discovered that Martínez promised to help Garza if he agreed to help kill Fischer. Garza confirmed to the police Martínez was working with a [...] "client" [...] (Cisneros) who wanted Fischer, along with anyone who got in the way, dead. Cisneros visited her at least three times to consult with her after the break-up. During their first meeting, Cisneros wanted to know if Fischer felt anything for her daughter. Martínez read through her cards and told her he was no longer in love with Cristina. Cisneros paid US$5 for the <b>card</b> <b>reading</b> and left the shop upset with Martínez's answer.|$|E

The production team had stated previously that one episode in this series was so long that {{there was no time for}} a preview. Many viewers, and writer Steven Moffat, had criticised the use of a preview for [...] "World War Three" [...] at the end of the 2005 episode [...] "Aliens of London" [...] as it spoiled the dramatic cliffhanger ending. Beginning with [...] "The Impossible Planet", trailers for the second part of stories were run during the middle eight, after the main credits, to allow viewers time to switch off.|$|E

2500|$|Victims {{were transported}} {{to the place of}} {{execution}} by trucks. Usually they were brought from Pawiak prison, rarely from Mokotów Prison. SS soldiers tried to convince their victims {{that they are going to}} transfer them to another prison or to a concentration camp. For this reason, death transports were usually formed at dusk and prisoners were allowed to take their belongings with them. Sometimes before departure convicts received an additional food ration and they were given back their documents from the prison's depository. Initially, these methods were so effective that the prisoners were not aware of the fate awaiting them. Later, when the truth about what was happening in Palmiry spread through Warsaw, some victims tried to throw short letters or small belongings from the trucks, in hopes that in this way they would be able to inform their families about their fate. During postwar exhumation some bodies were found with a <b>card</b> <b>reading</b> [...] "Executed in Palmiry", written by the victims shortly before their death.|$|E
2500|$|The title [...] "General Ignorance", chosen both {{to emulate}} and parody general {{knowledge}} quizzes, {{was first used}} to describe the final round of the panel game QI, which was created by Lloyd and had Mitchinson as head researcher. Appearing initially in the unbroadcast pilot (subsequently available on DVD), the round has varied little in content and style since, although the questions became slightly more obtuse. From the start the round consisted of several deliberately misleading questions which appear to have obvious answers that are actually inaccurate (for example, aircraft black boxes are in fact orange, for visibility.) The pilot also introduced the concept of penalising answers that were overly predictable, especially obvious jokes: one such question in the pilot was, [...] "What is the sixth most popular name for a baby boy in Germany?" [...] The answer to the question is, in fact, [...] "Tim". However, QI's regular panellist Alan Davies answered with the jokey suggestion [...] "Adolph", allowing host Stephen Fry to produce a prepared piece of <b>card</b> <b>reading</b> [...] "Adolph," [...] whereupon the obvious-but-inaccurate answer was revealed to carry a penalty score of −10 points. When the pilot was shown to the then-controller of BBC Two (Jane Root), it was this feature that particularly caught her attention, and penalties remained a regular feature throughout the first nine series of the programme. Due {{to the nature of the}} questions in the final round, however, the majority of penalties would always be awarded during [...] "General Ignorance".|$|E
2500|$|Ronnie later persuades Phil {{to come to}} Billy and Honey's {{engagement}} {{party where}} he coughs up blood and in hospital, the Mitchells are told Phil will be dead within twelve months unless he stops drinking and has a liver transplant. Ronnie then discovers that Joel has died. Ronnie learns that Phil must remain sober {{for at least six}} months before he can undergo the liver transplant, so she vows to help him regain his sobriety. She is stunned when Joel's daughter, Hannah Reynolds (Mia Jenkins), arrives, accusing her of killing Joel. Feeling remorseful, Ronnie tries to give Hannah's uncle Tim Reynolds (Charlie Baker) a cheque of £5,000 to help look after Hannah and her sisters, but Hannah tears it up. Jack later returns after Honey persuades him to but leaves again after Ronnie tells him they would not be together again. Tim also returns and tries to kiss Ronnie. She decides she still loves Jack, but believing he is getting married, she decides to stop the wedding but when she gets there, Jack is simply a guest at the wedding. Jack and Ronnie have sex but she returns to Walford alone, fearing she will break Jack's heart. However, Jack follows her and says he wants to spend his life with her. Unknown to Ronnie, a stalker leaves a wreath outside her house saying [...] "RIP Ronnie Mitchell". Funeral director Les Coker (Roger Sloman) informs Ronnie that someone emailed him that she had died, so Jack wonders who might want revenge on her and Sharon tells him she killed Carl, which angers him until Ronnie says it was self-defence. Ronnie receives flowers with a <b>card</b> <b>reading</b> [...] "RIP", and discovers the person who sent them gave their name as Danielle Jones. Ronnie confronts Hannah, who denies it all and Ronnie believes her, but Jack discovers Hannah's name was on the credit card that paid for the flowers, so Ronnie tells Hannah she knows she sent the flowers. Hannah steps into the road while holding Matthew and is nearly hit by a car. She is arrested for harassing Ronnie. However, Ronnie is still being watched by someone else. Ronnie becomes friends with Andy Flynn (Jack Derges), a builder who is helping Jack to renovate Max's old house into flats. Ronnie speaks in Hannah's defence in court and the charges are dropped. Hannah insists that she did not send Ronnie any death threats and she must have another enemy. Ronnie is concerned when Roxy returns, having been beaten up. Ronnie gives Roxy cash to pay off a debt, but Roxy leaves. Andy is then seen looking at newspaper stories about Ronnie that he has collected. Andy is exposed as the stalker but also revealed as Danielle's adoptive brother, Gareth Jones; Ronnie and he make amends after a heart to heart. He remorsefully leaves Walford. Ronnie and Jack get engaged. Ronnie supports Roxy through Dean's trial, comforting her when he is acquitted.|$|E
