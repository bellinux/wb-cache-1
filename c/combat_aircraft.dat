50|$|Nagoya was {{targeted}} for incendiary bombing {{because it was}} the center of the Japanese aircraft industry at the time. The city produced between forty and fifty percent of Japan's <b>combat</b> <b>aircraft's</b> and engines. Nagoya housed a port capable of holding 38 ships of up to 10,000 tons. Nagoya also produced equipment for the war effort including railway equipment, ball bearings and processed food.|$|R

The type was finally retired and phased out of service in 1992, with the 21 surviving airframes being sold off to an Australian warbird broker, Pacific Hunter Aviation Pty, in 1995.|$|E
5|$|In July 1941, Radford was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Naval Air Station in Trinidad, British West Indies. He protested this appointment because he feared he would remain there for years, sidelined as World War II loomed. In the event he only remained in this station for three months, following an organizational shift in the Bureau of Aeronautics. By mid-1941, thanks to a large expansion in the naval aviator program, squadrons could no longer train newly arrived aviators. Further, at that time, the vast difference {{in the performance of}} <b>combat</b> <b>aircraft</b> over training aircraft meant that pilots needed more time in <b>combat</b> <b>aircraft</b> before becoming proficient in them. Radford was subsequently visited by Artemus L. Gates, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air. The latter was so impressed that he ordered Rear Admiral John H. Towers, chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, to transfer Radford to a newly formed training division.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{designed}} as a fighter-like aircraft capable of very high speeds and altitudes, the project was repeatedly scaled back over time and the U.S. Air Force eventually abandoned it. Development was then {{taken up by the}} U.S. Army for a tactical <b>combat</b> <b>aircraft</b> requirement, a sort of high-performance helicopter. In flight testing, the Avrocar proved to have unresolved thrust and stability problems that limited it to a degraded, low-performance flight envelope; subsequently, the project was cancelled in September 1961.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of her career, over thirty {{aircraft}} were either lost or heavily damaged while operating from Melbourne. The majority of the aircraft ditched or crashed over the side, but some losses were due to catapult or arrestor cable failures. After Melbourne was decommissioned, the Fleet Air Arm ceased fixed-wing <b>combat</b> <b>aircraft</b> operation in 1984, with the final Tracker flight saluting the decommissioned carrier.|$|E

Twenty-six percent of the aircraft's structure is made of composites, reducing its weight by 480lb (217kg) compared to a conventional metal structure.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Air Force {{currently}} {{is in the}} process of developing an Airborne Network (AN) to provide support to its <b>combat</b> <b>aircrafts</b> on a mission. The reliability needed for continuous operation of an AN is difficult to achieve through completely infrastructure-less mobile ad hoc networks. In this paper we first propose an architecture for an AN where airborne networking platforms (ANPs - aircrafts, UAVs and satellites) form the backbone of the AN. In this architecture, the ANPs can be viewed as mobile base stations and the <b>combat</b> <b>aircrafts</b> on a mission as mobile clients. The <b>combat</b> <b>aircrafts</b> on a mission move through a space called air corridor. The goal of the AN design is to form a backbone network with the ANPs with two properties: (i) the backbone network remains connected at all times, even though the topology of the network changes with the movement of the ANPs, and (ii) the entire 3 D space of the air corridor is under radio coverage at all times by the continuously moving ANPs. In addition to proposing an architecture for an AN, the contributions of the paper include, development of an algorithm that finds the velocity and transmission range of the ANPs so that the dynamically changing backbone network remains connected at all times, development of a routing algorithm that ensures a connection between the source-destination node pair with the fewest number of path switching, given the dimensions of the air corridor and the radius of the coverage sphere associated with an ANP, development of an algorithm that finds the fewest number of ANPs required to provide complete coverage of the air corridor at all times, development of an algorithm that provides connected-coverage to the air corridor at all times, and development of a visualization tool that depicts the movement patterns of the ANPs and the resulting dynamic graph and the coverage volume of the backbone network...|$|R

40|$|Gz induced loss of {{consciousness}} (G-LOC) {{is one of the}} most serious threats to aircrews flying high performance fighter aircraft. From the early beginning of use of our Centrifuge, use in selection was primary task. As a functional “endpoints” we use criteria: loss of peripheral vision, extreme pulse rate (above 180 b. p. m.), arrhythmias and loss {{of consciousness}}. The key -method in selection the candidate who tolerates +Gz stress on the best way is selec tion by common selective centrifuge “Test of linear increasing of acceleration” (TOLIA). We used gradual onset rate (GOR – 0. 1 G/s) and maximum/peak value: + 5. 5 Gz, + 6. 0 Gz and 7. 0 Gz. Applied peak value depends on the goal of the test. The lowest peak val ue is for candidates planned for Air Academy, higher peak value is for those pilots planned for training to supersonic <b>combat</b> <b>aircrafts</b> and the highest peak value is for pilots who are planned to fly High performance <b>combat</b> <b>aircrafts.</b> We examined 2192 cand idates in the last 20 years. Eleven subjects experienced G -LOC episodes. All episodes of G -LOC had occurred occasionally and without warning symptoms (loss of peripheral vision, gray out, blackout).

5|$|The {{need for}} <b>combat</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{had been a}} problem for ONUC. The UN had been delaying the {{commencement}} of the operation until sufficient air strength had been amassed to conduct a single attack that could destroy the Katangese Air Force. They feared that a limited attack would fail to eliminate all Katangese aircraft and stretch their own forces thin, thereby allowing Katanga to disperse its air forces among hidden airfields and launch retaliatory attacks on Kamina Air Base. India had withdrawn its Canberra bombers in October to guard against China, and Ethiopia repatriated its force of Sabres after one was lost in an accident. However, new air surveillance radar equipment was deployed in Kamina and Élisabethville. The ONUC Air Division was bolstered in November by the delivery of two Saab 29 Tunnan (J-29) reconnaissance-variant jets from Sweden, greatly enhancing the force's intelligence capabilities. This was followed shortly thereafter by the arrival of several J-29 <b>combat</b> <b>aircraft</b> and a 380-strong anti-aircraft unit from Norway. In all, the UN would field 10 combat J-29s in the operation.|$|E
5|$|Despite Germany's reorganization, their {{manpower}} {{was still}} incomparable {{to that of}} the Western Allies. While Germany's Army Group B was able to increase their armored strength from 100 to 239 vehicles, these were opposed by 2,300 Allied tanks. Field Marshal Model reported that only 6,500 replacements had been sent to cover the 75,000 casualties suffered during the month of September. General Eisenhower commanded three army groups, totaling eight field armies with 55 divisions; these provided a two-to-one advantage in artillery guns and a twenty-to-one advantage in tanks, and could count on almost 14,000 <b>combat</b> <b>aircraft,</b> as compared to the Luftwaffe's 573.|$|E

TAI also produced 46 Block 40s for Egypt {{in the mid-1990s}} and 30 Block 50 from 2010. Korean Aerospace Industries opened a production line for the KF-16 program, producing 140 Block 52s from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s (decade). If India had selected the F-16IN for its Medium Multi-Role <b>Combat</b> <b>Aircraft</b> procurement, a sixth F-16 production line would be built in India.
