5|$|At trial, crucial {{testimony}} {{came from}} Chi Omega sorority members Connie Hastings, who placed Bundy {{in the vicinity}} of the Chi Omega House that evening, and Nita Neary, who saw him leaving the sorority house <b>clutching</b> <b>the</b> oak murder weapon. Incriminating physical evidence included impressions of the bite wounds Bundy had inflicted on Lisa Levy's left buttock, which forensic odontologists Richard Souviron and Lowell Levine matched to castings of Bundy's teeth. The jury deliberated for less than seven hours before convicting him on July 24, 1979 of the Bowman and Levy murders, three counts of attempted first degree murder (for the assaults on Kleiner, Chandler and Thomas) and two counts of burglary. Trial judge Edward Cowart imposed death sentences for the murder convictions.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{the league}} {{split into two}} {{division}}s, and the teams with the best records in each division played {{one another in the}} five-game ALCS to determine the pennant winner, who received (and continues to receive) the William Harridge Trophy. The trophy features a golden eagle, the league's emblem, sitting atop a silver baseball and <b>clutching</b> <b>the</b> American League banner. The trophy is named for Will Harridge, who was league president from 1931 to 1958. The format of the ALCS was changed from a best-of-five to a best-of-seven format in the 1985 postseason. In 1995, an additional playoff series was added when Major League Baseball restructured into three divisions in each league. , the winners of the Eastern, Central, and Western Divisions, as well as the AL Wild Card winner, play in the American League Division Series, a best-of-five playoff to determine the opponents who will play in the ALCS. American League pennant winners have gone on to win the World Series 65 times, most recently in 2017.|$|E

5|$|The Joker forces Batman {{into a game}} of {{hide and}} seek, giving him one hour to escape Arkham before his adversaries are sent to hunt him down. Although Batman {{initially}} refuses, he accepts the challenge after the Joker shoots a prison guard {{in the head and}} then threatens to kill Adams. However, unbeknownst to Batman, the Joker shortens the time from one hour to ten minutes after being pressured by the other inmates. Batman subsequently encounters Clayface, Mad Hatter, the Scarecrow, and Maxie Zeus, among other villains. During a struggle with Killer Croc, Batman is thrown out of a window, grabbing onto the statue of the angel Michael. <b>Clutching</b> <b>the</b> statue's bronze spear, Batman climbs back inside and impales Croc before throwing him out the window, sustaining a severe wound from the spear in the process.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantage}} to this design {{is that the}} brake is not being applied to slow the vehicle, it is simply <b>clutching</b> <b>the</b> second set of gears in or out. This means it does not dissipate energy, except in the brief period it is being applied or released. Smoother steering {{can be accomplished by}} partial application of the brake, but then it begins to dissipate energy like the braked differential. The main disadvantage is {{that there is only one}} turning radius. Like the standard differential solution, these systems are also subject to self-turning when travelling over terrain.|$|E

Tony arrives back home and, hearing about the hits, orders his family to go into hiding. Carmela and Meadow visit the Baccalieris, who are all in shock over Bobby's death.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 3 February 1945, Freisler was {{conducting}} a Saturday session of the People's Court when United States Army Air Forces bombers attacked Berlin. Government and Nazi Party buildings were hit, including the Reich Chancellery, the Gestapo headquarters, the Party Chancellery and the People's Court. Hearing the air-raid sirens, Freisler hastily adjourned the court and ordered that the prisoners before him be taken to an air-raid shelter, but stayed behind to gather files before leaving. A sudden direct hit on the court-building at 11.08 A.M. caused a partial internal collapse, with Freisler being crushed by a masonry column and killed while still in the courtroom.

500|$|The {{image was}} shot by {{photographer}} Jim Marshall one morning in the band's home of Macon, Georgia. The group were not very happy about being woken up early to shoot ("we figured it didn't make a damn bit of difference what the cover was or what time we took it," [...] said guitarist Dickey Betts). Normally the band hated being photographed; the cover of later retrospective release The Fillmore Concerts shows them displaying terminal boredom. However, during the session, Duane spotted a dealer friend, raced over and grabbed a bag of contraband, then returned to his seat, discreetly <b>clutching</b> <b>the</b> stash in his lap. This made the whole band laugh, resulting in a memorable image. Marshall stenciled the album title {{on one of the}} road cases, which were stacked in front of the wall.|$|E

[...] While she cried, she kissed the casket and said [...] "I love you". Her children surrounded her, and attempted to console her. Nancy then walked away with her military escort, <b>clutching</b> <b>the</b> folded flag. The military band began to play the Victorian hymn [...] "My Faith Looks Up to Thee" [...] as the Reagan children said their goodbyes.

500|$|El Sol resumed cargo {{service with}} the Morgan Line, {{where she had}} eight years of uneventful operation. On 11 March 1927, however, El Sol was inbound to New York with a $1,000,000 cargo of pig iron, copper, and bales of cotton. When a heavy fog settled over New York Harbor, Captain Charles H. Knowles ordered his ship to anchor until the fog cleared. As El Sol was being maneuvered into {{position}} at about 07:45, the American Diamond Line ship Sac City hit a glancing blow to El Sol, bounced off and then struck El Sol a second time, ripping through El Sols plating. Sac Citys bow had some slight damage, but El Sol sank quickly in about [...] of water about a half-mile (800 m) south of the Statue of Liberty.

Contained within is the assertion that Starkey bribed a guard and that the guard left the rope and the bucket for Starkey to climb which is also at odds with reporting from Phelps' 1844 publication and Hubbard's 1907 description of Starkey's capture and fatal escape. In 2007, The Boston Globe even when {{so far as to}} state that Starkey was found [...] "still <b>clutching</b> <b>the</b> bag of coins he intended to use to pay off the guard."
