40|$|An {{algorithm}} is presented which determines the <b>controllable</b> <b>sets</b> {{of a system}} directly from time series data. By determining these <b>controllable</b> <b>sets,</b> it is shown that a minimum time trajectory steering control problem is solved. A global model of the dynamics is not needed for computation since the algorithm exploits local properties of the data. Two algorithms are presented. The more simplistic algorithm relies on a sorting algorithm, while the second algorithm uses local linear models and a continuation scheme to solve problems associated with noise corruption and continuity.

40|$|An {{essential}} element of classical computation is the "if-then" construct, that accepts a control bit and an arbitrary gate, and provides conditional execution of the gate depending {{on the value of}} the controlling bit. On the other hand, quantum theory prevents the existence of an analogous universal construct accepting a control qubit and an arbitrary quantum gate as its input. Nevertheless, there are <b>controllable</b> <b>sets</b> of quantum gates for which such a construct exists. Here we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of unitary transformations to be controllable, and we give a complete characterization of <b>controllable</b> <b>sets</b> in the two dimensional case.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} {{to estimate the}} projection of a higher dimensional (three or more) <b>controllable</b> <b>set</b> onto a lower dimensional (usually one or two) space.

For some nonlinear dynamical system problems such as an aircraft missile avoidance problem, a proper transformation matrix still can be determined. From the transformed system, both an overestimate and an underestimate for an actual projected <b>controllable</b> <b>set</b> in the state space of interest can be provided by using the method presented in this dissertation.

40|$|Predictive {{control is}} a very useful tool in {{controlling}} constrained systems, since the constraints can be satisfied explicitly by the optimisations. Sets, namely, reachable <b>sets,</b> <b>controllable</b> <b>sets,</b> invariant sets, etc, play fundamental roles in designing predictive control strategies for uncertain systems. Meanwhile, {{in addition to the}} commonly assumed boundedness of the uncertainty, the explicit use of its stochastic properties can lead to improvement in system response. This thesis is concerned with robust set theories, mainly for reachable sets, with applications to time-optimal control; and the use of stochastic properties of the uncertainty to achieve less conservative controls. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we focus on LTI systems subject to, additional to the usual constraints, a constraint on the control change between sample times. One key ingredient in controlling such constrained systems is the initial control value, which, via analyses and simulations, is shown to be a useful extra degree of freedom. Reachable sets that incorporate this influential initial control value are derived and analyzed, with theoretical as well as computational algorithms developed for both nominal and uncertain systems under different types of feedback policy. Following this, the reachable set is discussed in connection with time-optimal control to obtain desired control laws. In addition, <b>controllable</b> <b>sets,</b> stabilisable sets and invariant sets for such constrained uncertain systems are studied. In the second part, the uncertainties are assumed to have stochastic properties. They are exploited in three different ways: the expected worst-case is used instead of the worst-case to achieve less conservative control even when the uncertainty is relatively large; the stochastic invariant set is proposed to provide alternative methods for approximating disturbance invariant sets; the relaxed set difference is developed to obtain less restrictive controls and/or replacing probabilistic constraint or slack variables.

40|$|Polyhedral control Lyapunov {{functions}} (PCLFs) are exploited in finite-horizon {{linear model}} predictive control formulations {{in order to}} guarantee the maximal domain of attraction (DoA), in contrast to traditional formulations based on quadratic control Lyapunov functions. In particular, the terminal region is chosen as the largest DoA, namely the entire <b>controllable</b> <b>set,</b> which is parametrized by a level set of a suitable PCLF. Closed-loop stability of the origin is guaranteed either by using an "inflated" PCLF as terminal cost or by adding a contraction constraint for the PCLF evaluated at the current state. Two variants of the formulation based on the inflated PCLF terminal cost are also presented. In all proposed formulations, the guaranteed DoA is always the entire <b>controllable</b> <b>set,</b> independently of the chosen finite horizon. Closed-loop inherent robustness with respect to arbitrary, sufficiently small perturbations is also established. Moreover, all proposed schemes can be formulated as Quadratic Programming problems.

In {{the first part of this}} thesis, some of the main ideas in set invariance theory are brought together and placed in a general, nonlinear setting.
