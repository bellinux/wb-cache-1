40|$|As part of {{the shift}} within second {{language}} acquisition (SLA) research toward complex systems thinking, researchers have called for investigations of social network structure. One strand of social network analysis yet to receive attention in SLA is network statistical models, whereby networks are {{explained in terms of}} smaller substructures of social ties. This article offers an overview and instructive demonstration of exponential random graph models as applied to a cohort of English for Academic Purposes students (N = 75) and their willingness to communicate in the second language (L 2 WTC). Results indicate that cross-cultural ties build off of intracultural ties through triadic <b>closure</b> (<b>meeting</b> through a mutual contact). Furthermore, situational subtypes of L 2 WTC are associated with various network tie patterns...|$|E
40|$|Unlike its {{predecessor}} project IRIScotland, which {{took a more}} top-down approach to developing repository services for users in Scottish HE institutions, the ERIS project took a bottom-up approach, and consulted potential users of repository systems widely {{at the outset of}} the project, whether these systems would be for use by single institutions or subject pools. The idea was to find out what the user community actually required in terms of repository systems and services. In practice we discovered that there was a range of opinion about the usefulness of repositories to researchers, and to institutions. Some groups within HE are already clear about the usefulness of the technology, and the associated workflows. These do not need much persuading. Others see the suggestion that they should use repositories to disseminate their research as an imposition of extra work, additional to the existing publication process, either for themselves or their research administrators. This spectrum of opinion surfaced in both the focus group activity and the case studies, reports on which form part of the appendices to this report. Perhaps surprisingly, the division of opinion was also found among the research pools and their users. The staff of the project responded to the spectrum of opinion, and the range of commitment to the role of repositories in dissemination, and in the research process, by reformulating their ideas about engagement with the research community in Scotland, and about what was required to achieve the goal of enhancing repository infrastructure for users and stakeholders. This was done in an agile way, and the new approach and new targets were formulated and agreed, and reflected in the quality plan which can be found at Appendix J. The new approach consisted of two strands. The first was about increased advocacy for the use of repositories, which involved the offer of hosted repository services during the later stages of the project, for institutions which did not already have their own institutional repositories. If these (generally) smaller institutions wished to continue to have access to these hosted repository spaces after the end of the project, it was proposed that these repository-lite services would be administered by the SDLC (the Scottish Digital Library Consortium), at minimal cost. The idea of this was to ensure at least a minimal level of provision nationally, to encourage the use of repositories. The second strand involved looking beyond the limited period of the project, to what would be required to promote the take-up and development of repository services in the longer term. It was concluded that this would involve developing the business case for continuing ERIS/IRIScotland type work. What the project had in mind was setting up co-ordinating groups and fora for meetings of stakeholders and users, and the research pools. This would be the responsibility of the SCOS group (the Scottish Council for Open Scholarship). It was planned that SCOS would be launched formally at a event <b>closure</b> <b>meeting,</b> held in the Royal Society of Edinburgh, in September 2011. [Quality Plan Appendix J]. The course of the project after the community consultations followed this new approach. The project continued to be agile in response, and influenced related work in Scotland (see section: ‘Outcomes’). We have a number of recommendations to make for future approaches to repository operations in Scotland. These are listed in a section following...|$|E

40|$|POLICY [REVISED] The Indiana Department of Child Services (DCS) will {{facilitate}} the Child and Family Team (CFT) Meeting process with every family at critical junctures throughout {{the life of}} the case beginning in the assessment phase and continuing through all case type <b>closures.</b> The CFT <b>Meeting</b> is a process and the composition of the team should continue to be expanded based on the needs of the family. The CFT Meeting model is a shared decision-making model and is a strength-based approach to assist with the initial and ongoing assessments of children and their families. The CFT Meeting process includes gathering formal and informal supports to achieve the goals identified by the family. This process will allow DCS to hear and understand the family’s voice and to assist families with building a support system that will remain in place after the DCS assessment or case has closed. [NEW] To assist families with achieving their goals, the most effective teams will always consist of at least one (1) or more formal or informal supports identified by the family. This strategy of team building will enable informal supports to continue assisting the family well after the exit of DCS and other formal supports.

40|$|How can a {{diversity}} of perspectives be accommodated in scientific and political consensus on environmental issues? This paper adopts a science and technology studies (STS) approach to examine how the pursuit of consensus-based knowledge and diverse participation, as seemingly contradictory commitments, have been converted into practice in the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Through a series of negotiations, these commitments have been translated into a set of situated practices that now dominate this expert panel. Consensus has been achieved through the pursuit of <b>closure,</b> in which <b>meetings</b> of expert and administrator groups produce texts, tables and images that stabilise ostensibly collective decisions. Within this framework, diverse perspectives have been accommodated through the production of typologies, such as lists of comparable options, which allow for the coexistence and commensurability {{of a range of}} knowledges and experts. However there is a politics to typologies, which requires specific attention to how decisions are made (deliberation), who participates in them (participation), {{and the extent to which}} these participants are representative of broader knowledge and policy communities (representation). While the potential of typologies to accommodate consensus and diversity offers the hope of realising ‘unity in diversity’ for both environmental knowledge and policy, recognising the politics of their production is important for more equitable processes of environmental governance.

40|$|This thesis studies how {{government}} in the US gathers and uses information effectively, {{and the role of}} federal advisory committees therein. All governments that serve the public interest encounter conflicting needs - on the one hand to gather information to solve important problems, {{and on the other hand}} to resist particularistic pressures of special interests both within and outside of government. Many governments choose to reconcile these demands in different ways - through balance of power, direct oversight, and procedural controls, for example - but these control mechanisms are costly. The use of such control mechanisms impacts both the effectiveness of advisory committees as information gathering tools, and how advisory committees are used. The body of the thesis consists of three papers. The first summarizes the available literature on information transmission and influence in complex environments, especially as they relate to delegation of authority. It categorizes the various bodies of theory and identifies the key lines of difference across these theories. The second paper tests hypotheses about <b>meeting</b> <b>closure,</b> government capture, and committee authorization to ascertain which branches of government are most vulnerable to inappropriate influence. Results weakly predict that committees formed cooperatively by Congress and agencies are most vulnerable to special interests. The third paper uses survey data to test how process controls impact the effectiveness of committees,(cont.) and concludes that although openness does impair committee effectiveness somewhat, balanced membership strongly enhances effectiveness. To explain this apparent contradiction, it notes how balance requirements and other procedural controls enhance a committee's credibility, and reduce the likelihood that important information is dismissed as 'Cheap Talk'. by Kevin Dean Karty.

5000|$|The Waverley Route's {{fate was}} decided {{at a meeting}} of the MCEP on 21 May chaired by Peter Shore, Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, and {{attended}} by Willie Ross, Marsh, Tom Urwin, Ray Gunter, Dick Taverne and Ernest Fernyhough. Two supporters of the line - Antony Crosland and Lord Brown of Machrihanish - were absent. After hearing arguments on both sides, Shore summarised the Committee's opinion in favour of closure throughout [...] "as quickly as possible", noting that the effect on the movement of freight traffic would be minimal and that inconvenience for some passengers was an inevitable consequence of any <b>closure.</b> Following the <b>meeting,</b> Ross escalated the matter to the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, begging him [...] "to look at the cumulative consequences of our course of action on our standing in Scotland". Marsh countered with a memorandum which stated that could would affect [...] "only about 200 regular travellers ..., of whom all but 30 would be adequately catered for by alternative bus services", and that the subsidy required to continue the passenger service would run into more than several millions of pounds per year. He was supported by Peter Shore who sent a separate memorandum referring to the Central Borders study and its lack of support for the line. The Prime Minister replied to Ross on 5 June indicating that he saw no reason to reopen the MCEP's decision. An official statement by Richard Marsh in the House of Commons on 15 July 1968 confirmed the Waverley Route's demise. A petition against closure with 11,678 signatures presented to the Prime Minister in December 1968 by a Hawick housewife, Madge Elliot, accompanied by David Steel and Earl of Dalkeith, MP for Edinburgh North was to no avail. The line closed on Monday 6 January 1969, one of 37 lines closed by Marsh during his 18-month term of office. It was the largest railway closure in the United Kingdom until the closure of the Great Central Main Line a few months later.|$|R
40|$|This {{corrective}} action decision document (CADD) identifies and rationalizes the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Operations Office's {{selection of a}} recommended {{corrective action}} alternative (CAA) appropriate to facilitate the closure of Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 271, Areas 25, 26, and 27 Septic Systems, Nevada Test Site (NTS), Nevada, under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO). Located on the NTS approximately 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, CAU 271 consists of fifteen Corrective Action Sites (CASs). The CASs consist of 13 septic systems, a radioactive leachfield, and a contaminated reservoir. The purpose of this CADD is to identify and provide a rationale for {{the selection of a}} recommended CAA for each CAS within CAU 271. Corrective action investigation (CAI) activities were performed from October 29, 2001, through February 22, 2002, and April 29, 2002, through June 25, 2002. Analytes detected during the CAI were evaluated against preliminary action levels and regulatory disposal limits to determine contaminants of concern (COC) for each CAS. It was determined that contaminants of concern included hydrocarbon-contaminated media, polychlorinated biphenyls, and radiologically-contaminated media. Three corrective action objectives were identified for these CASs, and subsequently three CAAs developed for consideration based on a review of existing data, future use, and current operations in Areas 25, 26, and 27 of the NTS. These CAAs were: Alternative 1 - No Further Action, Alternative 2 - Clean Closure, and Alternative 3 - Closure in Place with Administrative Controls. Alternative 2, Clean Closure, was chosen as the preferred CAA for all but two of the CASs (25 - 04 - 04 and 27 - 05 - 02) because Nevada Administrative Control 444. 818 requires clean closure of the septic tanks involved with these CASs. Alternative 3, Closure in Place, was chosen for the final two CASs because the short-term risks of transportation were eliminated; long-term health risks were minimized by preventing public and worker access to contaminated media through physical and administrative controls; all waste will be managed in accordance with federal, state, and local requirements; and a cost-effective method for achieving protection and <b>meeting</b> <b>closure</b> requirements is provided. All CAAs were evaluated on technical merit focusing on performance, reliability, feasibility, and safety. These two alternatives were judged to meet all applicable state and federal regulations for closure of the site and reduced the potential for future exposure pathways to the contaminated soils at this site...|$|R
