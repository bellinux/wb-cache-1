The valve used to connect a small-diameter service line to a water main is called a <b>corporation</b> <b>stop</b> (also called a tap, or corp stop). One gooseneck joins the <b>corporation</b> <b>stop</b> to the water service pipe work. A second gooseneck links the supply pipeline to a water meter located outside the building.|$|E

40|$|Performance {{testing of}} direct-tapped PVC {{pressure}} pipe {{was conducted at}} the Utah Water Research Laboratory to verify and document its capabilities under cyclic pressure conditions. Twelve samples of nominal six-inch diameter, pressure class 150 PVC pipe, manufactured {{to satisfy the requirements}} of AWWA Standard C 900, were obtained from Uni-Bell Member producers. Five pipe samples were tapped and fitted with Â¾ inch <b>corporation</b> <b>stops</b> under a line pressure of 80 +- 5 psi. Another five samples were tapped fitted with one inch <b>corporation</b> <b>stops</b> under a pressure of 150 psi. Only <b>corporation</b> <b>stops</b> complying with AWWA Standard C 800 were used. The remaining two pipe samples were not tapped, for use as controls. All twelve pipe samples were subjected to 1. 5 million pressure cycles ranging from 100 to 200 psi. A continuous record of the pressure cycles was kept and a red dye was added to the water in the test pipes so that even the smallest amount of leakage could easily be detected. These cyclic tests represent an extreme condition that pressure class 150 psi, C 900 PVC pressure pipe, would rarely be subjected to in service. To reach 1. 5 million pressure surges, the pipe would need to be in service 171 years if such surges occurred once every hour on the average. A nearly instantaneous 5. 7 fps flow velocity change would be needed to increment the internal pressure by 100 psi. This velocity change would occur, for example, if a flow rate of 525 gpm were stopped by complete closure of a valve in a nominal six-inch diameter PVC pipe line. No leakage or seepage developed around any of the threaded <b>corporation</b> <b>stops</b> during the testing through 1. 5 million cycles of pressures varying from 100 to 200 psi at two second intervals...|$|R

At the same time, the California Franchise Tax Board reported that the same corporation owed more than $4,743.40 in taxes, fines, and associated penalties in the state of California for 2003 through 2007, because the corporation did not file tax returns in the state for those years. A Franken representative said that it followed the advice of an accountant who believed when the <b>corporation</b> <b>stopped</b> doing business in California that no further filing was required. Subsequently, Franken paid $70,000 in back income taxes in 17 states dating back to 2003, mostly from his speeches and other paid appearances.
