40|$|We {{show how}} a simple {{laboratory}} experiment can illustrate certain electrical transport properties of metallic granular media. At a low critical imposed voltage, {{a transition from}} an insulating to a conductive state is observed. This transition comes from an electro-thermal coupling {{in the vicinity of}} the microcontacts between grains where microwelding occurs. Our apparatus allows us to obtain an implicit determination of the microcontact temperature, which is analogous to the use of a resistive thermometer. The experiment also illustrates an old problem, the explanation of Branly's <b>coherer</b> <b>effect</b> - a radio wave detector used for the first wireless radio transmission, and based on the sensitivity of the metal fillings conductivity to an electromagnetic wave.

6000|$|And Emil Gluck {{chuckled and}} went his way. He knew. But {{how was the}} world to know? He had {{stumbled}} upon the secret in his old electroplating shop on Telegraph Avenue {{in the city of}} Oakland. It happened, at that time, that a wireless telegraph station was established by the Thurston Power Company close to his shop. In a short time his electroplating vat was put out of order. The vat- wiring had many bad joints, and, on investigation, Gluck discovered minute welds at the joints in the wiring. These, by lowering the resistance, had caused an excessive current to pass through the solution, [...] "boiling" [...] it and spoiling the work. But what had caused the welds? was the question in Gluck's mind. His reasoning was simple. Before the establishment of the wireless station, the vat had worked well. Not until after the establishment of the wireless station had the vat been ruined. Therefore the wireless station had been the cause. But how? He quickly answered the question. If an electric discharge was capable of operating a coherer across three thousand miles of ocean, then, certainly, the electric discharges from the wireless station four hundred feet away could produce <b>coherer</b> <b>effects</b> on the bad joints in the vat-wiring.|$|R
