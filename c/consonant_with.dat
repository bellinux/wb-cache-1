5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is nothing in the Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading <b>consonant</b> <b>with</b> the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E

5000|$|Co-articulated consonants or complex consonants are <b>consonants</b> {{produced}} <b>with</b> two simultaneous {{places of}} articulation.

25|$|Justeson and Stephens {{proposed}} that this inherent vowel system in Brahmi and Kharoṣṭhī developed by transmission of a Semitic abjad through the recitation of its letter values. The {{idea is that}} learners of the source alphabet recite the sounds by combining the <b>consonant</b> <b>with</b> an unmarked vowel, e.g. /kə/,/kʰə/,/gə/, {{and in the process}} of borrowing into another language, these syllables are taken to be the sound values of the symbols. They also accepted the idea that Brahmi was based on a North Semitic model.|$|E
25|$|The action–motivation model {{proposes that}} {{inconsistencies}} in a person's cognition cause mental stress, because psychologic inconsistency {{interferes with the}} person's functioning in the real world. Among the ways for coping, the person can choose to exercise a behavior that is inconsistent {{with his or her}} current attitude (a belief, an ideal, a value system), but later try to alter that belief to be <b>consonant</b> <b>with</b> a current behaviour; the cognitive dissonance occurs when the person's cognition does not match the action taken. If the person changes the current attitude, after the dissonance occurs, he or she then is obligated to commit to that course of behaviour.|$|E
25|$|In December 1763, Matthew Smith, {{one of the}} Paxton Boys, took a small {{scouting}} {{party to}} Conestoga Town to investigate reports of a hostile Indian being sheltered there. The party returned with tales of dozens of strange Indians occupying the town, and began to assemble a more substantial force. Col. Elder heard of the expedition, and sent a written message dissuading it, to no effect. On the morning of December 14, 1763, just before dawn, fifty armed and mounted Paxton Boys descended upon Conestoga Town, killed the six Indians they found there, and burned the town. While the Susquehannocks were probably in communication with hostile Indians on the frontier, {{the results of the}} Rangers' attack are hardly <b>consonant</b> <b>with</b> their supposed justification of harboring numerous hostile Indians.|$|E

25|$|Helena {{gave birth}} to the future emperor Constantine I on 27 February of an {{uncertain}} year soon after 270 (probably around 272). At the time, she was in Naissus (Niš, Serbia). In order to obtain a wife more <b>consonant</b> <b>with</b> his rising status, Constantius divorced Helena some time before 289, when he married Theodora, Maximian's daughter under his command. (The narrative sources date the marriage to 293, but the Latin panegyric of 289 refers to the couple as already married). Helena and her son were dispatched to the court of Diocletian at Nicomedia, where Constantine grew {{to be a member of}} the inner circle. Helena never remarried and lived for a time in obscurity, though close to her only son, who had a deep regard and affection for her.|$|E
25|$|For each {{consonant}} in an abugida, {{there is}} an unmarked symbol representing that consonant followed by a canonical or inherent vowel. For the Ge'ez abugida, this canonical vowel is ä, the first column in the table. However, since the pharyngeal and glottal consonants of Tigrinya (and other Ethiopian Semitic languages) cannot be followed by this vowel, the symbols in the first column in the rows for those consonants are pronounced with the vowel a, exactly as in the fourth row. These redundant symbols are falling into disuse in Tigrinya and are shown with a dark gray background in the table. When {{it is necessary to}} represent a <b>consonant</b> <b>with</b> no following vowel, the consonant+ə form is used (the symbol in the sixth column). For example, the word ’ǝntay 'what?' is written , literally ’ǝ-nǝ-ta-yǝ.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{many other}} major civilizations where written law {{was held in}} honor and often {{attributed}} to divine origin, law in early China was viewed in purely secular terms, and its initial appearance was greeted with hostility by Confucian thinkers as indicative of a serious moral decline, a violation of human morality, and even a disturbance of the total cosmic order. Historically, the people's awareness and acceptance of ethical norms was shaped far more by the pervasive influence of custom and usage of property and by inculcating moral precepts than by any formally enacted system of law. Early emperors however embraced the Legalist ideal {{as a way of}} exerting control over their large and growing territory and population. This process was integrated with traditional Chinese beliefs in the cosmic order, holding that correct behavior was behavior <b>consonant</b> <b>with</b> the appropriate responses set by fǎ. Xíng states the potential costs to the individual of exceeding them and imposes penalties for these actions.|$|E

25|$|The {{second part}} is signed by {{those from the}} first signing and in {{addition}} by professors Ulrich Kridweiss of Esslingen, Konrad Vorn of Kampen, Cornelius Pays of Breda and Dietrich of Balveren (Bummel). Signatories attest that: 1) The Masters of Holy Theology written below commend the Inquisitors into Heretical Depravity appointed by {{the authority of the}} Apostolic See in conformity with the Canons, and urge that they think it right to carry out their office zealously.2) The proposition that acts of sorcery can happen with God's permission through sorcerers or sorceresses when the Devil works with them is not contrary to the Catholic Faith, but <b>consonant</b> <b>with</b> the statements of Holy Scripture. Indeed, according to the pronouncements of the Holy Doctors it is necessary to admit that such acts can sometimes happen.3) It is therefore erroneous to preach that acts of sorcery cannot happen, because in this way preachers impede, {{to the extent that they}} can, the pious work of the inquisitors, to the prejudice of the salvation of souls. Nonetheless, secrets that are heard at any time by inquisitors should not be revealed to everyone.4) All princes and Catholics should be urged to think it right to assist such pious vows on the part of the Inquisitors in defense of the Holy Catholic Faith.|$|E

5000|$|Proto-Edoid is reconstructed {{as having}} a {{contrast}} between oral and nasal consonants and oral and nasal vowels typical for the region. However, in some Edoid languages nasal vowels have been reanalyzed as allophones of oral vowels after nasal consonants, and in others nasal consonants have been reanalyzed as allophones of oral consonants before nasal vowels, {{reducing the number of}} phonemically nasal consonants. Urhobo retains three nasals, , and has five oral <b>consonants</b> <b>with</b> nasal allophones, in Edo this is reduced to one phonemic nasal, , but eight additional <b>consonants</b> <b>with</b> nasal allophones, and in Ukue there are no indisputably phonemic nasals and only two <b>consonants</b> <b>with</b> nasal allophones, [...]|$|R

500|$|Maintaining {{that humans}} had no free will, Priestley argued {{that what he}} called [...] "philosophical necessity" [...] (akin to {{absolute}} determinism) is <b>consonant</b> <b>with</b> Christianity, a position based on {{his understanding of the}} natural world. Like the rest of nature, man's mind is subject to the laws of causation, Priestley contended, but because a benevolent God created these laws, the world and the people in it will eventually be perfected. Evil is therefore only an imperfect understanding of the world.|$|E
500|$|Other {{accomplished}} {{early works}} include the two string quartets, composed between 1928 and 1930, in which Tippett sought {{to combine the}} styles of Beethoven and Haydn respectively with folk-song, as Beethoven had in his Rasumovsky quartets of 1806. Tippett explains the withdrawal of these and the other early works: [...] "I realised very clearly {{that they were not}} totally <b>consonant</b> <b>with</b> myself. I didn't think they had the stamp of artistic durability. So I took the whole lot along to R.O. Morris who agreed that they didn't show enough technical mastery." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{objection}} {{forms the}} basis of the [...] "Teach the Controversy" [...] campaign by the Discovery Institute, a think tank based in Seattle, Washington, to promote the teaching of intelligent design in U.S. public schools.

[...] Several other attempts were made to insert intelligent design or creationism into the U.S. public school curriculum, including the failed Santorum Amendment in 2001.|$|E
50|$|Palatal consonants are <b>consonants</b> {{articulated}} <b>with</b> {{the body}} of the tongue raised against the hard palate (the middle part of the roof of the mouth). <b>Consonants</b> <b>with</b> the tip of the tongue curled back against the palate are called retroflex.|$|R
