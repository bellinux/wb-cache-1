25|$|Wadi Akarit lay on an east–west line, {{from the}} Mediterranean Sea {{in the east}} and the impassable salt marshes at Sebkret el Hamma (the east end of the <b>Chott</b> el Djerid) to the west. There were no flanks to turn as there had been at the Tebaga Gap and no {{opportunity}} to disperse the defenders by attacking at several points, as at the Second Battle of El Alamein; a frontal attack on prepared defences was unavoidable. From the coast, the defence line followed Wadi Akarit for , which was impassable to armour and then a wider section of dry wadi, backed by a long hill, Djebel er Roumana, the last of a line of high ground that forms the northern boundary of the <b>Chott.</b> The approaches to Djebel er Roumana were obstructed by an anti-tank ditch and there were more defence works to the west, although the broken ground was a significant obstacle.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Tacfarinas {{put an end}} to Musulamii hopes of halting the Roman {{takeover}} of their traditional grazing lands. The registration of the whole plateau for tax purposes was launched by Dolabella immediately after Tacfarinas' demise and completed in 29/30 AD, as evidenced by the stone markers laid down by the Roman surveyors, some of which survive to this day. They reach as far as the <b>Chott</b> el Jerid on the province's southern border. The region was largely turned to grain production and the Musulamii and other tribes most likely permanently excluded from their former grazing areas.|$|E

The Area of <b>chotts</b> and sabkhas of Gadain region can be considered as an area of degradation lands due to the dynamics of sabkhas and <b>chotts</b> that are localized and installed on large areas on one hand and accelerated anthropogenic pressure on the other hand.

25|$|Southern Tunisia is {{a region}} of broken terrain, with rocky ridge lines and desert, which obstruct manoeuvre; {{opposite}} a bight where the north–south coast opens to the east, a semi-arid, scrub covered coastal plain is met inland by the Matmata Hills which run south to north. North of Gabès, the road to Sfax passes between {{the sea and the}} Chotts, the only route north for the Eighth Army. Across the plain in a line roughly south-west to north-east, lay the Mareth line, a fortification built by the French in the 1930s. In the north, the hills and line of forts terminated at the Tebaga Gap, a low pass between the Matmata Hills and the Djebel Tebaga, another line of high ground {{to the west of the}} gap running east–west. North and west of this feature is the <b>Chott</b> el Djerid and west of the Matmata Hills, dry Jebel Dahar country and then the impassable sand of the Grand Erg Oriental. Gabès lies on the coast, where the plain meets the route from the Tebaga Gap.|$|E
25|$|Long {{before the}} Eighth Army reached {{the port of}} Tripoli, thought {{had been given to}} an attack on the Mareth line and the LRDG had been sent to survey the land south of the Matmata Hills. Despite maps and reports {{indicating}} that the ground was impossible for tanks and lorrries, the LRDG found a route inland southwards and around the hills to the Tebaga Gap, between the <b>Chott</b> el Fejaj salt marsh and the hills. The 7th Armoured Division (Major-General George Erskine) had probed forward from Tripoli, while the 51st (Highland) Division (Major-General Douglas Wimberley) and the 2nd New Zealand Division (Major-General Bernard Freyberg) rested at the port. Winter rains turned the ground into a swamp, until a short lull beginning on 15 February, when the 7th Armoured and 51st (Highland) divisions moved forward and captured airfields at Medenine on 17 February. Next day the Free French Flying Column (FFFC) and the 1st Infantry Battalion Marine and Pacific (1st IBMP) arrived with General Philippe Leclerc, after a long march across the Sand Sea from Lake Chad to join the Eighth Army. XXX Corps (Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese) brought the 2nd New Zealand Division forward from Tripoli, which had the 8th Armoured Brigade and the 201st Guards Brigade under command.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{transition}} facies between evaporate and clay, carbonate and siliciclastic deposits occurs {{within the}} Lower Cretaceous of Southern Tunisia. The sedimentary deposits comprise four major transgressive-regressive sedimentary sequences with distinctive sabkha, tidal to shallow carbonate marine platform, and mixed siliciclastic ramp environments. Sedimentation rates, {{as well as}} thickness and facies changes were controlled by tectonic, climatic and eustatic factors. Transgression pulses encompassing the whole Late Hauterivian–Barremian, Early Aptian and Late Albian have controlled the basin infill. Evaporate and siliciclastic systems pass gradually to carbonate deposition in the <b>Chotts</b> area. Our sedimentation model helps to decipher the roles of tectonics and, to a lesser extent, climate and palaeogeographic changes as the key factors of evaporate, carbonate and siliciclastic deposit sequences. Furthermore, sea level changes exert additional control on their environmental differentiations in such an ancient sedimentary basin. The sedimentary environments and palaeogegraphy in the <b>Chotts</b> chain during Hauterivian to Albian time are also reconstructed...|$|R
2500|$|Filming {{began in}} <b>Chott</b> el Djerid, while a {{construction}} crew in Tozeur took eight weeks {{to transform the}} desert into the desired setting. Other locations included the sand dunes of the Tunisian desert near Nafta, where a scene featuring a giant skeleton of a creature lying in the background as R2-D2 and C-3PO make {{their way across the}} sands was filmed. When actor Anthony Daniels wore the C-3PO outfit {{for the first time in}} Tunisia, the left leg piece shattered down through the plastic covering his left foot, stabbing him. He also could not see through his costume's eyes, which was covered with gold to prevent corrosion. Abnormal radio signals caused by the Tunisian sands made the radio-controlled R2-D2 models run out of control. Kenny Baker, who portrayed R2-D2, said: [...] "I was incredibly grateful each time an [...] would actually work right." [...] After several scenes were filmed against the volcanic canyons outside Tozeur, production moved to Matmata to film Luke's home on Tatooine. Lucas chose Hotel Sidi Driss, which is larger than the typical underground dwellings, to shoot the interior of Luke's homestead. Additional scenes for Tatooine were filmed at Death Valley in North America.|$|E
2500|$|Rommel {{had wanted}} retreat to Wadi Akarit in the Gabès area, [...] further west, where the non-{{motorised}} troops could defend the narrow {{gap between the}} Mediterranean and the <b>Chott</b> Djerid.

At a meeting with Hitler on 28 November, Rommel discussed the proposal but only received a promise of more supplies.
