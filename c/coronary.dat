5|$|A {{cohort study}} {{suggested}} that treatment of FH with statins {{leads to a}} 48% reduction in death from <b>coronary</b> heart disease {{to a point where}} people are no more likely to die of <b>coronary</b> heart disease than the general population. However, if the person already had <b>coronary</b> heart disease the reduction was 25%. The results emphasize the importance of early identification of FH and treatment with statins.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1967, Favaloro began {{to consider the possibility}} of using the saphenous vein in <b>coronary</b> surgery. He put his ideas into practice {{for the first time in}} May of that year. The basic principle was to bypass a diseased (obstructed) segment in a <b>coronary</b> artery in order to deliver blood flow distally. The standardization of this technique, called bypass or transmyocardial revascularization surgery, was the fundamental work of his career, and ensured that his prestige would transcend the limits of his country, as the procedure radically changed the treatment of <b>coronary</b> disease. In 1970 he published one of his best-known volumes, Surgical Treatment of <b>Coronary</b> Arteriosclerosis.|$|E
5|$|In the beginning, {{the major}} part of his work {{revolved}} around valvular and congenital diseases; later on he became interested in other areas. Every day, having hardly finished working in the operating room, Favaloro would spend hours and hours reviewing <b>coronary</b> angiograms and studying <b>coronary</b> arteries and their relation with the cardiac muscle. The laboratory of Sones, father of the <b>coronary</b> angiography, had the largest collection of angiograms in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Surgery, when {{considered}} {{necessary for}} {{diseases of the}} heart, can take place via an open operation or via small guidewires inserted via peripheral arteries ("percutaneous <b>coronary</b> intervention"). Percutaneous <b>coronary</b> intervention is usually used {{in the context of}} an acute <b>coronary</b> syndrome, and may be used to insert a stent.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's long {{histories}} {{of cardiovascular disease}} and periodic need for urgent health care raised questions of whether he was medically fit to serve in public office. Having smoked approximately 3 packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 20 years, Cheney had his first of five heart attacks in 1978, at age 37. Subsequent attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000, and 2010 have resulted in moderate contractile dysfunction of his left ventricle. He underwent four-vessel <b>coronary</b> artery bypass grafting in 1988, <b>coronary</b> artery stenting in November 2000, urgent <b>coronary</b> balloon angioplasty in March 2001, and the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in June, 2001.|$|E
5|$|Heart tissue, {{like all}} {{cells in the}} body, needs to be {{supplied}} with oxygen, nutrients {{and a way of}} removing metabolic wastes. This is achieved by the <b>coronary</b> circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Blood flow through the <b>coronary</b> vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating to the heart muscle's relaxation or contraction.|$|E
25|$|The <b>coronary</b> {{circulation}} system provides a blood {{supply to the}} heart muscle itself. The <b>coronary</b> circulation begins near {{the origin of the}} aorta by two <b>coronary</b> arteries: the right <b>coronary</b> artery and the left <b>coronary</b> artery. After nourishing the heart muscle, blood returns through the <b>coronary</b> veins into the <b>coronary</b> sinus and from this one into the right atrium. Back flow of blood through its opening during atrial systole is prevented by the Thebesian valve. The smallest cardiac veins drain directly into the heart chambers.|$|E
25|$|A study {{comparing}} {{the outcomes of}} all patients in New York state treated with CABG or percutaneous <b>coronary</b> intervention (PCI) demonstrated CABG was superior to PCI with DES in multivessel (more than one diseased artery) <b>coronary</b> artery disease (CAD). Patients treated with CABG had lower rates of death and of death or myocardial infarction than treatment with a <b>coronary</b> stent. Patients undergoing CABG also had lower rates of repeat revascularization. The New York State registry included all patients undergoing revascularization for <b>coronary</b> artery disease, but was not a randomized trial, and so may have reflected other factors besides the method of <b>coronary</b> revascularization.|$|E
25|$|Cahn et al. prospectively followed-up 152 {{patients}} with <b>coronary</b> artery disease for 6–11 months by carotid artery ultrasonography and noted 22 vascular events (myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke, and <b>coronary</b> angioplasty) within this time period. They concluded that carotid atherosclerosis measured by this non-interventional method has prognostic significance in <b>coronary</b> artery patients.|$|E
25|$|The terms single bypass, double bypass, triple bypass, quadruple bypass and quintuple bypass {{refer to}} the number of <b>coronary</b> arteries {{bypassed}} in the procedure. In other words, a double bypass means two <b>coronary</b> arteries are bypassed (e.g., the left anterior descending (LAD) <b>coronary</b> artery and right <b>coronary</b> artery (RCA)); a triple bypass means three vessels are bypassed (e.g., LAD, RCA and left circumflex artery (LCX)); a quadruple bypass means four vessels are bypassed (e.g., LAD, RCA, LCX and first diagonal artery of the LAD) while quintuple means five. Left main <b>coronary</b> artery obstruction requires two bypasses, one to the LAD and one to the LCX.|$|E
25|$|A <b>coronary</b> {{catheterization}} is a {{minimally invasive}} procedure to access the <b>coronary</b> circulation and blood filled chambers of the heart using a catheter. It is performed for both diagnostic and interventional (treatment) purposes.|$|E
25|$|Angiography was {{historically}} used {{to detect}} <b>coronary</b> artery aneurysms, and remains {{the gold standard for}} their detection, but is rarely used today unless <b>coronary</b> artery aneurysms have already been detected by echocardiography.|$|E
25|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (heart attack) {{occurs in}} 1–2% of aortic dissections. The {{cause of the}} infarction is involvement of the <b>coronary</b> arteries, which supply the heart, in the dissection. The right <b>coronary</b> artery is involved more commonly than the left <b>coronary</b> artery. If the myocardial infarction is treated with thrombolytic therapy, the mortality increases to over 70%, mostly due to bleeding into the pericardial sac causing pericardial tamponade.|$|E
25|$|In {{recognition}} of the focused training required by cardiologists to perform percutaneous <b>coronary</b> interventions and the rapid progression {{in the field of}} percutaneous <b>coronary</b> interventions, specialized fellowship training in the field of Interventional Cardiology was instituted in 1999.|$|E
25|$|SEMS {{are also}} {{sometimes}} {{used in the}} vascular system, usually in the aorta and peripheral vascular system. In the past they {{have been used for}} saphenous vein graft and native <b>coronary</b> artery percutaneous <b>coronary</b> interventions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>coronary</b> arteries {{start in}} {{the right and left}} aortic sinus and provide blood to the heart muscle in a similar fashion to most other vertebrates. Other {{domestic}} birds capable of flight have three or more <b>coronary</b> arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. The blood supply by the <b>coronary</b> arteries are fashioned starting as a large branch over the surface of the heart. It then moves along the <b>coronary</b> groove and continues on into the tissue as interventricular branches toward the apex of the heart. The atria, ventricles, and septum are supplied of blood by this modality. The deep branches of the <b>coronary</b> arteries found within the heart tissue are small and supply the interventricular and right atrioventricular valve with blood nutrients for which to carry out their processes. The interatrial artery of the ostrich is small in size and exclusively supplies blood to only part of the left auricle and interatrial septum.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coronary</b> artery luminal {{narrowing}} {{reduces the}} flow reserve for oxygenated {{blood to the}} heart, typically producing intermittent angina. Very advanced luminal occlusion usually produces a heart attack. However, it has been increasingly recognized, since the late 1980s, that <b>coronary</b> catheterization does not allow {{the recognition of the}} presence or absence of <b>coronary</b> atherosclerosis itself, only significant luminal changes which have occurred as a result of end stage complications of the atherosclerotic process. See IVUS and atheroma for a better understanding of this issue.|$|E
25|$|He had two <b>coronary</b> {{interventions}} {{earlier that}} year. On 7 February 2010, he developed {{problems with the}} common carotid artery and needed surgery. On 11 September 2010, he was hospitalized due to <b>coronary</b> artery blockage and needed an angioplasty.|$|E
25|$|With early treatment, rapid {{recovery}} from the acute symptoms can be expected, {{and the risk of}} <b>coronary</b> artery aneurysms is greatly reduced. Untreated, the acute symptoms of Kawasaki disease are self-limited (i.e. the patient will recover eventually), but the risk of <b>coronary</b> artery involvement is much greater. Overall, about 2% of patients die from complications of <b>coronary</b> vasculitis. Patients who have had Kawasaki disease should have an echocardiogram initially every few weeks, and then every one or two years to screen for progression of cardiac involvement.|$|E
25|$|Disease of {{the left}} main <b>coronary</b> artery (LMCA).|$|E
25|$|Russert's {{longtime}} friend and physician, Dr. Michael Newman, said that his asymptomatic <b>coronary</b> artery disease had been controlled with medication (LDL-C was <70 mg/dL) and exercise, {{and that he had}} performed well on a stress test in late April. An autopsy performed on the day of his death determined that his history of <b>coronary</b> artery disease led to a myocardial infarction (heart attack) and ventricular fibrillation with the immediate cause being an occlusive <b>coronary</b> thrombosis in the left anterior descending artery resulting from a ruptured cholesterol plaque.|$|E
25|$|Disease of {{all three}} <b>coronary</b> arteries (LAD, LCX and RCA).|$|E
25|$|Acute <b>coronary</b> {{syndrome}} (ACS) is a syndrome (set {{of signs}} and symptoms) due to decreased blood {{flow in the}} <b>coronary</b> arteries such {{that part of the}} heart muscle is unable to function properly or dies. The most common symptom is chest pain, often radiating to the left shoulder or angle of the jaw, crushing, central and associated with nausea and sweating. Acute <b>coronary</b> syndrome is usually caused by one of three problems: ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, 30%), non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI, 25%), or unstable angina (38%).|$|E
25|$|So far, no {{large-scale}} research {{involving the}} incidence of atherosclerosis and <b>coronary</b> heart disease in adults with cystic fibrosis has been conducted. This is likely because {{the vast majority of}} people with cystic fibrosis do not live long enough to develop clinically significant atherosclerosis or <b>coronary</b> heart disease.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Coronary</b> Drug Project was {{intended}} to study the safety and effectiveness of drugs for long-term treatment of <b>coronary</b> heart disease in men. Those {{in the placebo group}} who adhered to the placebo treatment (took the placebo regularly as instructed) showed nearly half the mortality rate as those who were not adherent.|$|E
25|$|Inhalation of {{nitrous oxide}} is used {{frequently}} to relieve pain associated with childbirth, trauma, oral surgery, and acute <b>coronary</b> syndrome (includes heart attacks). Its use during labour {{has been shown}} to be a safe and effective aid for birthing women. Its use for acute <b>coronary</b> syndrome is of unknown benefit.|$|E
25|$|Echocardiogram {{may show}} subtle <b>coronary</b> artery changes or, later, true aneurysms.|$|E
25|$|A <b>coronary</b> artery may be {{unsuitable}} for bypass grafting {{if it is}} small (< 1nbsp&mm or < 1.5nbsp&mm), heavily calcified, or located within the heart muscle {{rather than on the}} surface. A single obstruction of the left main <b>coronary</b> artery is associated with a higher risk for a cardiac death and usually receives a double bypass.|$|E
25|$|There is {{only very}} weak {{evidence}} linking to <b>coronary</b> heart disease.|$|E
25|$|He died of <b>coronary</b> {{occlusion}} on June 8, 1936, in Gloucester, Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|People {{diagnosed}} with heterozygous (carrier) β-thalassemia have some protection against <b>coronary</b> heart disease.|$|E
25|$|UA {{may occur}} unpredictably at rest, {{which may be}} a serious {{indicator}} of an impending heart attack. What differentiates stable angina from unstable angina (other than symptoms) is the pathophysiology of the atherosclerosis. The pathophysiology of unstable angina is the reduction of <b>coronary</b> flow due to transient platelet aggregation on apparently normal endothelium, <b>coronary</b> artery spasms, or <b>coronary</b> thrombosis. The process starts with atherosclerosis, progresses through inflammation to yield an active unstable plaque, which undergoes thrombosis and results in acute myocardial ischemia, which, if not reversed, results in cell necrosis (infarction). Studies show that 64% of all unstable anginas occur between 22:00 and 08:00 when patients are at rest.|$|E
25|$|The {{approximate}} {{prevalence of}} the metabolic syndrome {{in patients with}} <b>coronary</b> heart disease (CHD) is 50%, with a prevalence of 37% in patients with premature <b>coronary</b> artery disease (age 45), particularly in women. With appropriate cardiac rehabilitation and changes in lifestyle (e.g., nutrition, physical activity, weight reduction, and, in some cases, drugs), the prevalence of the syndrome can be reduced.|$|E
25|$|The {{first use}} of a <b>coronary</b> stent is {{typically}} attributed to Jacques Puel and Ulrich Sigwart when they implanted a stent into a patient in Toulouse, France in 1986. It {{was used as a}} scaffold to prevent the vessel from closing and to avoid restenosis in <b>coronary</b> surgery—a condition where scar tissue grows within the stent and interferes with vascular flow. Shortly thereafter in 1987, Julio Palmaz (known for patenting a balloon-expandable stent) and Richard Schatz implanted their similar stent into a patient in Germany. The use of these bare-metal stents helped reduce the incidence of restenosis from 30–40% in <b>coronary</b> surgery to 20–30%.|$|E
25|$|CABG {{is often}} {{indicated}} when <b>coronary</b> arteries have a 50 percent to 99 percent obstruction. The obstruction being bypassed is typically due to arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, or both. Arteriosclerosis {{is characterized by}} thickening, loss of elasticity, and calcification of the arterial wall, most often resulting in a generalized narrowing in the affected <b>coronary</b> artery. Atherosclerosis is characterized by yellowish plaques of cholesterol, lipids, and cellular debris deposited into the inner layer of {{the wall of a}} large or medium-sized <b>coronary</b> artery, most often resulting in a focal partial obstruction in the affected artery. Either condition can limit blood flow if it causes a cross-sectional narrowing of at least 50 percent.|$|E
25|$|During <b>coronary</b> {{catheterization}} (often {{referred to}} as a cath by physicians), blood pressures are recorded and X-ray motion picture shadow-grams of the blood inside the <b>coronary</b> arteries are recorded. In order to create the X-ray pictures, a physician guides a small tube-like device called a catheter, typically ~2.0mm (6-French) in diameter, through the large arteries of the body until the tip is just within the opening of one of the <b>coronary</b> arteries. By design, the catheter is smaller than the lumen of the artery it is placed in; internal/intraarterial blood pressures are monitored through the catheter to verify that the catheter does not block blood flow.|$|E
