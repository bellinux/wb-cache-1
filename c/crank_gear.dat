40|$|During the {{start-up}} {{and shut down}} phase of reciprocating compressors the loads on all components of driven train system are very high. In this paper a method for the calculating the forces on coupling, e-motor, crank shaft as well other components of the system will be described. The modelling of the electrical induction motor, coupling, crank shaft, damper {{as well as the}} compressor resistance torque are extremely important in simulating start-up and shut down of reciprocating compressor. Equally important, are the switching torque of the electrical motor and the instantaneous moment of inertia of the reciprocating compressor <b>crank</b> <b>gear.</b> The transient start-up and shut down process under loaded and unloaded is described using a non-linear differential equation for driven train system: EMotor – Coupling – Flywheel – Reciprocating compressor - Damper. Shaft torsional moments on the drive train and especially on the coupling, whether elastic or stiff, can then only be calculated using numerical simulation...|$|E
40|$|Rekluse Motorsports of Boise, ID has {{sponsored}} an MBE senior project to design an interactive display for their aftermarket dirt bike clutches. They {{would like a}} free standing structure that runs off electricity so emissions are not a concern inside at trade shows. The purpose is to the show the expansion and engagement of the clutch to display the unique features. The user {{should be able to}} experience what sets a Rekluse clutch apart from other aftermarket clutches. To meet this request, a kiosk style display has been designed and will be built to meet their needs. The display features a CRF 450 dirt bike engine, handle bars with clutch lever, brakes and throttle. The standard clutch cover will be removed and replaced with a clear one so clutch function is visible. The throttle will input to an electric motor that will spin a <b>crank</b> <b>gear</b> to spin clutch. Once the user provides enough throttle for the clutch to engage, a drive wheel on the output shaft will spin to simulate the drive wheel on an actual bike. As a result, the user will experience the same feel of the Rekluse clutch without having to be on a bike to test drive it...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{technical}} diagnostics of ship diesel engine – generator installation – is proposed. Spectral-power diagnostic {{parameters of the}} synchronous generator voltage and currents are used. The electric machine {{in this case is}} the multipurpose sensor of diagnostic parameters. A judgment {{on the quality of the}} operational processes in diesel engine cylinders and its technical condition is possible on the basis of these parameters. This method is applicable to piston compressor installations with electric drive. On the basis of such parameters as rotating torque, angular speed and angular acceleration it is possible to estimate the quality of the operating process in the cylinders of a diesel engine, the condition of its cylinder-piston group and the <b>crank</b> <b>gear</b> mechanism. The investigation was realized on the basis of a diesel-generator with linear load. The generator operation was considered for the case of constant RL load. Together with the above mentioned, the condition of bearings of synchronous machines, uniformity of the air gap, windings of the electric machine were estimated during the experiments as well. The frequency spectrum of the stator current of the generator was researched and analyzed. In this case the synchronous machine is becoming a rather exact multipurpose diagnostic sensor. The signal of non-uniformity in the operation process of diesel engine cylinders and its technical condition is the increasing of the amplitudes of typical frequencies...|$|E

Though it lacked an Aerofoil section wing (the most crucial aspect of an airplane), in general layout his flying machine resembled modern aircraft design more than did the Wright brothers' machine: monoplane rather than biplane; tractor rather than pusher propeller; stabiliser and elevators at the back rather than the front; and ailerons rather than wing-warping for controlling banking (although much {{the same can be}} said for the much earlier, and unsuccessful Adar Avion III, excluding the ailerons).|$|R

50|$|The second {{generation}} K5 models incorporated the rear hatch glass and tailgate {{into a single}} unit, which allowed the glass panel to retract inside of the tailgate by use of a manual crank mounted on the tailgate or an electric motor activated by a key-operated switch on the tailgate and a dash-mounted switch. The weight of the large glass panel was rumored to be a liability as the manual <b>crank</b> <b>gears</b> wore prematurely and the electric motor was prone to frequent overheating and subsequent failure. This also included the electric motor drive cable which goes to the window regulator to the motor (similar in design to a speedometer cable), which usually would fail under heavy abuse. Another feature of the K5 Blazer tailgate was the safety switch connected to the electric motor which prevented the rear window from being raised if the tailgate was unlatched.|$|R

While its rectangular format was typical of earlier Kodak 16 mm cameras (such as Cine-Kodak, Kodak Models B, F and K), the CKS 'box' was formed by two joined sections: the spring motor half with the user controls, winding <b>cranks,</b> and <b>gear</b> work to the shutter.

50|$|At {{first it}} was {{classified}} as a Standard Class glider, {{which at the time}} allowed flaps instead of air-brakes for approach control.

50|$|Technical {{innovation}} continued. Unlike railway locomotives where {{equipment is}} mounted on a frame, traction engines use the boiler as the frame. This cuts down on weight but introduces stresses and holes for the rivets which could {{be a source of}} leaks or failures. In 1870 Aveling introduced horn plates which were extensions of the outer firebox and which carried all the motion, <b>cranks</b> and <b>gearing.</b> Preston regards this as one of Aveling's most important inventions. Also in 1870 he took out a patent on a simplified reversing gear. Eight years later he managed to move the gears between the bearings, not overhanging. The resultant motion was stronger and narrower allowing a more compact engine.|$|R
50|$|Some seeders/spreaders have {{directional}} fins {{to control}} {{the direction of the}} material that is thrown from the spreader. All broadcast spreaders require some form of power to spin the disk. On hand carried units, a hand <b>crank</b> spins <b>gears</b> to turn the disk. On tow behind units, the wheels spin a shaft that turns gears which, in turn, spin the disk. As is partially visible in one of the photos, with tractor mounted units, a mechanical P.T.O. shaft connected to the tractor and controlled by the tractor operator, spins the disk. There are some seeder/spreaders made for garden size tractors that use a 12 volt motor to spin the dispersing disk and yaw.|$|R
5000|$|The Italian 1931 Schneider Trophy entrant, the Macchi M.C.72, {{required}} an engine of 2,300 horsepower (1,700 kW) with {{the capability of}} producing up to 2,800 horsepower (2,090 kW) while having a weight of not more than 840 kilograms (1,850 lb). The contract was awarded to Fiat, but as their most powerful V engine to that date was the 1,000-horsepower (750 kW) 12-cylinder Fiat AS.5 that had also been used for Schneider Trophy racing, the company faced a difficult challenge. The novel solution was to couple two AS.5 V12 engines in tandem to produce a V-24 with each engine independently driving one {{of a pair of}} contra-rotating propellers through co-axial shafts. Except for sharing a common mechanical supercharger, the unit was more a [...] "tandem V12" [...] than a true V24, which would require all cylinders to power a single crankshaft, rather than dual crankshafts rotating in opposite directions with independent crank and driveshafts, or at least to have both <b>cranks</b> <b>geared</b> together to drive a single output. The rear engine drove the front propeller through a reduction gearbox, located between the two engines, up to a shaft that passed between the cylinder banks of the reverse-mounted forward engine. The latter's crankshaft drive faced rearwards and drove the rearmost propeller in a likewise manner, but instead via a hollow shaft passing between the cylinder banks through which the rear engine driveshaft passed. [...] A large rear-mounted mechanical centrifugal supercharger was used to boost the engine, with the fuel/air mixture being delivered to the cylinders through a manifold that was centrally mounted between the cylinder banks of both engines.|$|R
