The general purpose is to propose an internally consistent system of concepts which allows classification of cartographic presentation methods based on <b>unambiguous</b> <b>criteria.</b> For this purpose, in the article the concept of presentation method and the concept of presentation form were differentiated, the cartographic presentation method was divided into stages, and possible data transformation and visualization aspects during application of a method were specified. Then, review of the previous classifications of cartographic presentation methods was conducted which allows differentiation of two fundamental approaches to classification and comparison of the applied criteria. On this basis, the author’s classification of cartographic presentation methods was suggested in which three qualitative and four quantitative methods were differentiated.

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{behavioral}} account of subjective performance evaluation inflation (i. e., leniency bias) and compression (i. e., centrality bias). When a manager observes noisy signals of employee {{performance and the}} manager strives to produce accurate ratings but feels worse about unfavorable errors than about favorable errors, the man-ager’s selfishly optimal ratings will be biased upwards. Both the uncertainty about performance and the asymmetry in the manager’s utility are necessary conditions for performance evaluation inflation.

However, the <b>unambiguous</b> <b>criteria</b> used to validate the aromaticity of that were controversial or inadequate in theory. In this work, the global aromaticity of the compounds has been studied using the ELF, NICS and ISE.

The correlations between NICS(max) σzz and NICS(max) πzz with respect to aromaticity are demonstrated, specifically between NICS(max) πzz and ELFπ (cc = 0. 98) for π bonds.

40|$|The {{study of}} the role of dynamic metal {{speciation}} in lipophilic membrane permeability in aqueous solution requires accurate interpretation of experimental data. To meet this goal, a general theory is derived for describing 1 : 1 metal complex flux, under steady-state and ligand excess conditions, through a permeation liquid membrane (PLM). The theory is applicable to fluxes through any lipophilic membrane. From this theory, fluxes in the three rate-limiting conditions for metal transport are readily derived, corresponding, namely, to (i) diffusion in the source solution, (ii) diffusion in the membrane, and (iii) the chemical kinetics of formation/dissociation of the metal complex in the interfacial reaction layer. The theory enables discussion of the reaction layer concept in a more general frame and also provides <b>unambiguous</b> <b>criteria</b> for the definition of an inert metal complex. The theoretical flux equations for fully labile complexes were validated in a previous paper.

As documented for the Gyra fan, they consist of allochthonous, sublittoral and/or littoral sediments.

However, most of these characteristics do not represent diagnostic, <b>unambiguous</b> <b>criteria</b> for {{the determination of the}} event source. The Gyra fan is built up of up to four stratigraphic subunits, each showing different sedimentary characteristics. This diagnostic feature together with the sheer dimension of the fan, its consistent general internal stratigraphical architecture, the occurrence of mud drapes between individual subunits and the synopsis of the sedimentary and microfaunal findings argue for a tsunami-induced rather than a storm-induced formation. This scenario fits best with the local geomorphological settings and the regional storm and wave climates. The subunits likely correspond to at least four major inundation phases during one tsunami event. Sediment transport and related deposition seem to have been largest during flooding impulses in the middle part of the tsunami wave train.|$|R

Near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectra at the C and IN K-edges provide unique signatures for microbes. Aragonite crystals, which range in size from 30 to 100 nm, comprise the largest part of the microbialites. These crystals are surrounded by a 10 -nm-thick amorphous calcium carbonate layer containing organic molecules and are embedded in an organic matrix, likely consisting of polysaccharides, which helps explain the unusual sizes and shapes of these crystals.

40|$|Correlation {{functions}} of adiabatic modes in cosmology are constrained by {{an infinite number}} of consistency relations, which relate N + 1 -point correlation functions with a soft-momentum scalar or tensor mode to a symmetry transformation on N-point correlation func-tions of hard-momentum modes. They constrain, at each order n, the qn behavior of the soft limits. In this paper we show that all consistency relations derive from a single, master identity, which follows from the Slavnov-Taylor identity for spatial diffeomorphisms. This master identity is valid at any value of q and therefore goes beyond the soft limit. By differ-entiating it n times with respect to the soft momentum, we recover the consistency relations at each q order. Our approach underscores the role of spatial diffeomorphism invariance at the root of cosmological consistency relations. It also offers new insights on the necessary conditions for their validity: a physical contribution to the vertex functional must satisfy certain analyticity properties in the soft limit in order for the consistency relations to hold. For standard inflationary models, this is equivalent to requiring that mode functions have constant growing-mode solutions. For more exotic models in which modes do not “freeze ” in the usual sense, the analyticity requirement offers an <b>unambiguous</b> <b>criterion.</b> a...|$|R

The semiparametric approach allows the generalization of mixtures of distributions while making no specific parametric assumptions about {{the distribution of the}} hidden heterogeneity of the cDNAs. The semiparametric {{approach was}} applied to study gene expression in the brains of Apis mellifera ligustica honey bees raised in two colonies (A. m. mellifera and ligustica) with consistent patterns across five maturation ages. Results: The semiparametric approach provided <b>unambiguous</b> <b>criteria</b> to detect groups of genes, trajectories and probability of gene membership to groups. The semiparametric results were cross-validated in both colony data sets. Gene Ontology analysis enhanced by genome annotation helped to confirm the semiparametric results and revealed that most genes with similar or related neurobiological function were assigned to the same group or groups with similar trajectories. Ten groups of genes were identified and nine groups had highly similar trajectories in both data sets. Differences in the trajectory of the reminder group were consistent with reports of accelerated maturation in ligustica colonies compared to mellifera colonies. Conclusion: The combination of microarray technology, genomic information and semiparametric analysis provided insights into the genomic plasticity and gene networks linked to behavioral maturation in the honey bee. </p...|$|R

The gas velocity where the first large bubbles are detected, with an average diameter of 1. 5 cm, and with a frequency of occurrence of one bubble per s, is designated as the first regime transition point (transition from the homogeneous regime to the transition regime). At this point, the coherent standard deviation of the measured pressure fluctuations clearly increases from zero.

Using the " 50 per cent rule" as a device to catalogue the type of connexion - irrespective of the morphology - all hearts were described in unambiguous fashion. A comparison with synonyms, as frequently used for purposes of classification, revealed that the latter are often insufficient properly to classify the basic abnormality. By classifying the type of connexion and describing the morphology separately, no basic problem remains in distinguishing between hearts with double outlet right ventricle and subpulmonary ventricular septal defect and hearts with the morphology of Fallot's tetralogy with an aorta almost exclusively arising from the right ventricle. Similarly, the classification of hearts with complete transposition and subpulmonary defect in the setting of the so-called Taussig-Bing heart is brought back to its proper perspective. Proper and consistent application of the sequential segmental approach leaves no room for ambiguity, even in complicated hearts with overriding arterial valve...|$|R
