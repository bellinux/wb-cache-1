25|$|The pitch {{itself had}} become slower and slower. Some {{observers}} {{said that it}} was useless to bowlers and batsmen alike. That wasn't true, because some of the batsmen showed beyond all doubt that anyone who <b>could</b> <b>really</b> hit the ball could play it away with ease, power, and safety as it rose slowly from the turf.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} he <b>could</b> <b>really</b> do no wrong.

George Frideric Handel was also keen to engage Farinelli for his company in London, and while in Venice in January 1730, tried unsuccessfully to meet him.|$|E

25|$|The medieval Baldrick was {{probably}} the only Baldrick of the four who <b>could</b> <b>really</b> be described as clever. Baldrick, an ex-dung shoveller (a respected position, which he had {{worked very hard to}} get – earlier jobs include milking pigs and mucking out lepers) and Son of Robin the Dung Gatherer, first met Prince Edmund at the feast before the Battle of Bosworth Field and using flattery became his Squire. The two, along with Lord Percy, toasted their new friendship, unaware that from that point onwards, their descendants' lives would be eternally entwined.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{debate about whether}} Archaeopteryx <b>could</b> <b>really</b> fly. It appears that Archaeopteryx had the brain {{structures}} and inner-ear balance sensors that birds use to control their flight. Archaeopteryx also had a wing feather arrangement like that of modern birds and similarly asymmetrical flight feathers on its wings and tail. But Archaeopteryx lacked the shoulder mechanism by which modern birds' wings produce swift, powerful upstrokes (see diagram above of supracoracoideus pulley); this may mean that it and other early birds were incapable of flapping flight and could only glide.|$|E
25|$|German espionage {{activity}} in Cuba was minor, despite the country's {{importance to the}} Allied war-effort, and was eliminated by Allied counter-intelligence before it <b>could</b> <b>really</b> begin. Shortly after {{the beginning of the}} war, the Germans began operating a clandestine communications network in South America to collect secret information and safely smuggle it out of the region to Occupied Europe. For Cuba, the Abwehr sent a man named Heinz Lüning to Havana with orders to establish a secret radio station and then transmit the information he collected to agents in South America, where it would then be sent directly to Germany.|$|E

25|$|The season {{proved to}} be one of the most {{dramatic}} and controversial on record. While Hunt's performances in the Hesketh had drawn considerable praise, there was some conjecture as to whether he <b>could</b> <b>really</b> sustain a championship challenge. Now a works McLaren driver, he dispelled many doubters at the first race in Brazil, where, in a hastily rebuilt McLaren M23, he landed pole position in the last minutes of qualifying. Over the course of the year he would drive the McLaren M23 to six Grands Prix wins, but with superior reliability, reigning world champion and main rival Niki Lauda pulled out a substantial points lead in the first few races of the season. Hunt's first race win of 1976, at the fourth race of the season, the Spanish Grand Prix, resulted in disqualification for driving a car adjudged to be 1.8cm too wide. The win was later reinstated upon appeal, but it set the tone for an extraordinarily volatile season. At the British Grand Prix, Hunt was involved in a first corner incident on the first lap with Lauda which led to the race being stopped and restarted. Hunt initially attempted to take a spare car, however this was disallowed, and during this time the original race car was repaired, eventually winning the restarted race. Hunt's victory was disallowed on 24 September by a ruling from the FIA after Ferrari complained that Hunt was not legally allowed to restart the race.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} the AWA, Jannetty and Michaels were {{contacted}} by WWF owner Vince McMahon informing them {{that he was willing}} to bring them back if they were able to be more professional this time round. By the end of May the team was working for the WWF under the shortened name The Rockers. They officially made their television debut on the June 18, 1988 edition of WWF Superstars of Wrestling in a squash match. The Rockers made their pay-per-view (PPV) debut at the 1988 Survivor Series as part of the 10 team tag match. They eliminated The Bolsheviks from the match before being eliminated by a double-disqualification in a brawl with the Brain Busters. The brawl between The Rockers and The Brain Busters led to a match taped for WWF Superstars of Wrestling where both teams were disqualified once again, this time before the match <b>could</b> <b>really</b> start. This led to a series of house show matches between the two teams, a series of matches that drew rave reviews from the fans. One match in particular on January 23, 1989 was rated as one of the 50 greatest matches in the PWI 10th year anniversary issue. The Brain Busters narrowly defeated The Rockers, as Anderson held down Marty Jannetty's leg as Blanchard pinned him. The feud continued to rage on as they clashed at Saturday's Night Main Event in a match that saw both teams counted out for brawling on the floor.|$|E

According to Peppiatt, [...] "it {{would be no}} exaggeration to say that, if one <b>could</b> <b>really</b> explain the origins and {{implications}} of this scream, one would be far closer to understanding the whole art of Francis Bacon". Gilles Deleuze wrote that, in Bacon's screams, [...] "the entire body escapes through the mouth".|$|E
500|$|Gielgud {{was in the}} Oxford {{company in}} January and February 1924, from October 1924 {{to the end of}} January 1925, and in August 1925. He played a wide range of parts in {{classics}} and modern plays, greatly increasing his technical abilities in the process. The role he most enjoyed was Trofimov in The Cherry Orchard, his first experience of Chekhov: [...] "It was the first time I ever went out on stage feeling that perhaps, after all, I <b>could</b> <b>really</b> be an actor." ...|$|E

5000|$|Over {{the next}} three years, the lineup {{continued}} to alter. Arguelles and Hall both left, saxophonist Steve Buckley arrived and the band also gained a permanent drummer, Martin France [...] At one point the band featured two bass players, Steve Watts and Tim Harries. Bates admits [...] "Neither of them knew why they were both there. I didn't know either; I {{was still trying to}} find a band that <b>could</b> be <b>really</b> powerful without being macho, and <b>could</b> be <b>really</b> experimental without being bollocks." ...|$|R
500|$|Gerry Anderson {{remembered that}} AP Films had never {{attempted}} to film skiing sequences previously, but judged {{the scenes of}} Penelope and Tin-Tin travelling to Olsen's lodge to be suitably realistic. Anderson himself conceived the [...] "ski thrusters" [...] that the agents use to power their ascent up the mountainside while returning to Paradise Peaks. Praising production designer Bob Bell's visuals, he opined that the episode [...] "gave our art and design departments {{a chance to show}} what they <b>could</b> <b>really</b> do, and they didn't let us down." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{frequent}} {{criticism of}} the Bates method {{is that it has}} remained relatively obscure, which is seen as proof that it is not truly effective. Writer Alan M. MacRobert concluded in a 1979 article that the [...] "most telling argument against the Bates system" [...] and other alternative therapies was that they [...] "bore no fruit". In regards to the Bates method, he reasoned that [...] "If palming, shifting, and swinging <b>could</b> <b>really</b> cure poor eyesight, glasses would be as obsolete by now as horse-drawn carriages." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{underground}} {{success of the}} band's second studio album Kerplunk (1992), {{a number of major}} record labels became interested in Green Day. Representatives of these labels attempted to entice the band to sign by inviting them for meals to discuss a deal, with one manager even inviting the group to Disneyland. The band declined these advances until meeting producer and Reprise representative Rob Cavallo. They were impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo [...] "was the only person we <b>could</b> <b>really</b> talk to and connect with".|$|E

[...] His entire life revolves around creativity, and that's something I <b>could</b> <b>really</b> relate to." [...] Kierszenbaum praised Kills' work ethic during the recording sessions, stating that she would focus simultaneously on the melodic and lyrical structure of song, {{as well as its}} soundscape. He {{went on to say that}} she [...] "influenced the timbre of the sound" [...] and assisted the production as if [...] "she's making a movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Barry Rosen said, [...] "We {{were very}} lucky that [...] were so human-grounded, so we <b>could</b> <b>really</b> play off {{of them and}} the way they looked at things that [...] went through. They were also able to get into real-life situations, romances, getting in trouble, jealousies and so on." [...] Although Vandernoot and Kirsch are three years apart in age (Vandernoot being the older of the two), on set Vandernoot treated Kirsch like a young boy, while Kirsch seemed to her like a younger brother because of his {{youthful}} appearance.|$|E
500|$|Owing to {{the strange}} {{nature of the}} language, the Century 21 writers would brief Unwin on episode plots and then leave space in their scripts for the actor to draft all the Unwinese {{dialogue}} himself. Shane Rimmer, who scripted the episode [...] "Hole in One", remarked that [...] "A lot of [...] you had to leave to [...] You gave him a line of patter that's {{going to work with}} what he does.
