5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E

5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man. It was the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serpent in the Garden of Eden who caused the downfall of Adam and Eve. However, for the troubadours, green {{was the color of}} growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.|$|E
5|$|In Polish heraldry, the {{tincture}} of {{the charge}} has priority {{in relation to the}} tincture of the field. In the case of Polish national colors, white, the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Eagle, should always be placed in a more honorable position than red, the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field of the Polish coat of arms. In the most usual, horizontal alignment, this means that the white stripe is placed above the red one. If the alignment is vertical, the white stripe should be on the left from the onlooker's point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white stripe should be placed on the left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers. If it drapes a coffin, the white stripe should be placed over the heart.|$|E

5|$|Krishna is {{represented}} in the Indian traditions in many ways, but with some common features. His iconography typically depicts him with black, dark, or blue skin, like Vishnu.

5|$|Manganese {{compounds}} {{have been}} used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass. The brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of manganese compounds. In the glass industry, manganese compounds are used for two effects. Manganese(III) reacts with iron(II) to induce a strong green color in glass by forming less-colored iron(III) and slightly pink manganese(II), compensating for the residual <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iron(III). Larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass.|$|E

Molecular genetic analysis revealed that the lilac-brown bolete was separate from both of these genera, and merited placement in a new genus.

Originally, in the event a pope was not elected, damp straw was added to the fire to create dark smoke. In the event a new pope was elected, the ballots were burned alone, creating white smoke.|$|E
5|$|The dark bluish-green {{color and}} the widely spaced, deeply cut and {{indented}} pinnae differentiate A.montanum from most related species.

Wall-rue (A.ruta-muraria) has a green stipe, and its pinnae have longer stalks and are broadest near the tip. Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a hybrid between Bradley's spleenwort and mountain spleenwort, is intermediate between its parents. When compared with mountain spleenwort, the blade of Wherry's spleenwort is lance-shaped, rather than triangular; the upper parts of the blade are not as deeply cut; and the dark <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stipe extends {{to the beginning of}} the rachis.|$|E
