500|$|Speaking {{about the}} reveal that Fitz was just imagining the {{presence}} of Simmons due to the injuries he sustained {{at the end of}} the first season, Tancharoen said, [...] "We didn’t want him to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> experience unscathed. He clearly suffered major trauma to his body. The lack of oxygen to his brain has to have consequences because that’s how it is in real life. We wanted there to be a price. Basically, he in his own Fitz way had professed his love for her, and then he came out of that. How do you <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> experience without any physical damage, there would still be probably a change to their relationship because the feelings are out in the open. But, of course, being the people that we are, we wanted to make it even more painful and compound it." ...|$|E
500|$|When Joan Baez {{first met}} Dylan in April 1961, {{she had already}} {{released}} her first album and was acclaimed as the [...] "Queen of Folk". On hearing Dylan perform his song [...] "With God on Our Side," [...] Baez later said, [...] "I never thought anything so powerful could <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> little toad". In July 1963, Baez invited Dylan to join her on stage at the Newport Folk Festival, setting the scene for similar duets {{over the next two}} years. By the time of Dylan's 1965 tour of the U.K, their romantic relationship had begun to fizzle out, as captured in D. A. Pennebaker's documentary film Dont Look Back. Baez later toured with Dylan as a performer on his Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975–76, and sang four songs with Dylan on the live album of the tour, [...] Baez appeared with Dylan in the one-hour TV special Hard Rain, filmed at Fort Collins, Colorado, in May 1976. Baez also starred as 'The Woman In White' in the film Renaldo and Clara (1978), directed by Dylan and filmed during the Rolling Thunder Revue. Dylan and Baez toured together again in 1984 with Carlos Santana.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} for [...] "TS-19" [...] transpired at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, {{which was}} depicted as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Producers {{of the show}} {{were not allowed to}} photograph the interior of the actual buildings as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a point of reference due to its high security. Although the location was not featured in the comics of the same name, Hurd felt {{that it was important to}} add because of its close proximity to the survivor's camp. As opposed to the previous episode, where filming mostly took place outside of the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, production for [...] "TS-19" [...] occurred inside of the building. Darabont conceived the idea of exploring into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [...] "When Frank was pitching the idea to me, saying he wanted to bring them to the CDC and telling me all the different things that he felt would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> story, the science of it all and the being trapped in the small location, I was very much picturing a lot of Day of the Dead stuff," [...] stated creator Robert Kirkman.

500|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} Jeremy Davies character Daniel Faraday. Daniel {{was introduced in the}} fourth season and was originally intended to be a minor character only. However, his quiet demeanor and seemingly good heart made him a favorite with the fans, so Lindelof and Cuse decided to expand Daniel's role, which has led to him being a key player in Losts eventual resolution. In response to Daniel's death, Cuse said, [...] "It was an incredibly painful thing to kill this beloved character, but we feel that’s what this show has to do. His death is kind of the culminating event in the entire season. It really ends one chapter and commences the start of the final chapter of the entire series." [...] Once the show runners explained that to Davies, he was saddened that his full-time status on Lost was coming to an end, but put the story [...] "above his own personal self". Damon seconded Carlton's emotions, adding that Jeremy took the news well: [...] "When Carlton and I called Jeremy to explain what was going to be happening with Daniel, we’ve never had a more awesome exit interview with somebody on the show. For us, Daniel really was the cornerstone of the fifth season – he really shined. I can’t imagine what Season 5 would have looked like without Jeremy Davies. When you think about all the crazy stuff that had to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> guy’s mouth, for him to be as interesting and emotional and poetic as he was is really extraordinary." [...] The cast of the show said Davies would be missed, though he may not be done with Lost — Carlton commented that Jeremy's [...] "full-time" [...] status was over, but dead characters have been known to reappear on the show. Michael Emerson, who plays Ben, said Davies was [...] "a great sensitive guy who got deep into his character, he really lived it." ...|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started writing}} {{the songs on}} the album, she was {{inspired}} by different situations, like having guitar lessons and getting an idea, or sometimes Ahmadzaï would send over a rough demo to her without the basic chord progression. The songs on American Life and their lyrics were developed like that. Explaining her writing process, Madonna told Q magazine that the [...] "music has to jar my brain in terms of lyrics. Sometimes I write free verse. I have a journal and I note down ideas I get from newspapers and books". Madonna also remembered Ahmadzaï's downbeat existentialism regarding the condition of society around them, and the long discussions they had into the night, which ultimately reflected into the songwriting as anxiety they felt in their heart. American Life was deemed {{by some as a}} concept album featuring political themes based around the United States, with Madonna explaining that she felt [...] "like America has changed over the years and that a lot of our values seem to be materially oriented and so superficial. And we all seem to be obsessed with fame {{just for the sake of}} fame, no matter what— sell your soul to the devil if that's what it takes. And we're also completely obsessed with the way we look." [...] Madonna recalled that even she had been through such trials and those musings came out in the writing of the first three songs, the title track, [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "I'm So Stupid". John Norris from MTV described them as a trilogy, and an indicator of Madonna's reassessment of her life while discussing things she wishes to put behind her. Madonna partly agreed, saying that the tracks are extensions of one another, and portray her desire of giving importance to less noteworthy things, and how she could <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> [...] "illusion". Madonna discussed the materialistic themes of the record and her personal encounters which have led to the composition with MTV saying: ...|$|E

[...] Schembechler recalled, “He was absolutely great, and the freshmen absolutely loved it. [...] And let me tell you, {{every one of those}} freshmen came out of that session with Revelli knowing ‘The Victors.’ [...] They knew the words, they knew how to sing it, and they knew how to emphasize the right spots. [...] They flat out knew how to do it. [...] And it was only because he came over there with the idea that those guys were going to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> meeting room knowing how to sing this fight song the right way or else!

2500|$|In 2003, after S Club disbanded, Stevens {{signed a}} £1.5million solo four-album deal with Polydor Records and re-signed with Fuller. She said that {{breaking}} {{out on her}} own after success with S Club was difficult: [...] "I think we [...] ended up conforming to what people's perceptions were. This one was the ditzy one, this one was the singer, this one was the dancer. And to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> and be a whole person has been a real challenge for me. I didn't have my say, really, in the group. None of us did". Her first solo single, written by Cathy Dennis and produced by Bloodshy & Avant, [...] "Sweet Dreams My LA Ex", was released in September 2003. Taking inspiration from R and adult-style pop music, Stevens's debut solo album, Funky Dory, was released later that month. The album was a minor hit, reaching number 9 on the UK albums chart. Although it was not a huge commercial success, it gained praise from pop critics; Jamie Gill, in a review for Yahoo! Launch, said that Stevens [...] "eschews the cheap and cheerful approach of her old band for a slinky adult confidence and musical eclecticism." [...] That December the album's title track [...] "Funky Dory", featuring a sample of the David Bowie song [...] "Andy Warhol" [...] from his album Hunky Dory, was released as its second single and failed to match the success of [...] "Sweet Dreams My LA Ex", peaking at number twenty-four.|$|E
