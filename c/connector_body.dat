Once the adhesive sets, the fiber's end is polished to a mirror finish. Various polish profiles are used, {{depending on the type of}} fiber and the application. For single-mode fiber, fiber ends are typically polished with a slight curvature that makes the mated connectors touch only at their cores. This is called a physical contact (PC) polish. The curved surface may be polished at an angle, to make an angled physical contact (APC) connection. Such connections have higher loss than PC connections, but greatly reduced back reflection, because light that reflects from the angled surface leaks out of the fiber core. The resulting signal strength loss is called gap loss. APC fiber ends have low back reflection even when disconnected.|$|E

50|$|A camlock is an {{interchangeable}} {{electrical connector}} {{often used in}} temporary electrical power production and distribution. The most common form is the 16 series, rated at 400 amperes with 105 °C terminations. Also in common use is the 15 series (mini-cam), rated at 150 amperes. A larger version is made denoted as the 17 series with ratings up to 760 A. A ball nose version and a longer nose standard version exist-the latter is the most common. Another version is the Posi-lok which has controlled interconnection sequencing to a panel and a shrouded connector body.The early version original connector was hot-vulcanized to the cable body;later versions use dimensional pressure to exclude foreign material from the connector pin area;the tail of the <b>connector</b> insulator <b>body</b> is trimmable to fit the cable outer diameter.|$|R
5000|$|As an {{additional}} complication, certain electronic connector designs may incorporate combinations {{of male and}} female pins in a single <b>connector</b> <b>body,</b> for mating with a complementary connector with opposite gender pins in corresponding positions. In these unusual cases, gender is often defined by the shape of the <b>connector</b> <b>body,</b> rather than the mixed-gender connector pins and sockets. These types of connectors are not strictly speaking hermaphroditic, since mating connectors are not freely interchangeable. An informal term that has been used for these connectors is [...] "bisexual", in addition to the more official terminology, mixed-gender. Thus, for example, one can have a mixed-gender female plug that connects to a mixed-gender male jack (though a reversed gender assignment of connectors would be a more typical design choice in this example).|$|E

This paper examines the influence of fiber orientation and fiber length on electrical properties of PALF reinforced Bisphenol-A composite and explores the potential of using PALF as reinforcing material for electrical applications such as terminals, <b>connectors,</b> motor <b>body</b> cover, industrial and household plugs and circuit boards. The resistance and inductance of resin material is increased by 24. 19 % and 24. 13 % respectively after reinforcement of PALF in different orientations and its value increased by 37. 93 % and 37. 81 % respectively after reinforcement of PALF in different lengths.

50|$|Hermetic vs. Water-Proof vs. Water-Resistant {{refers to}} the {{coupling}} seal between the contacts, <b>connector</b> insert and <b>body.</b> A true hermetic connector provides an airtight seal and can support and maintain positive pressure or a vacuum. Waterproof connectors prevent liquid ingress when immersed {{using a variety of}} methods (e.g., molding, potting and encapsulating) to prevent water intrusion at high hydrostatic pressures. Water resistant implies that a coupled connector will prevent water ingress that can lead to shorting in shallow standing water or rain. Typically this is achieved by inserting rubber gaskets and compression seals at the contract region {{as well as at the}} cable entry.|$|R
50|$|The Push-pull {{connector}} {{was invented}} by Swiss connectors manufacturer LEMO and {{is a type of}} cable interconnect that provides a strong locking mechanism that is only released by squeezing the <b>connector</b> <b>body,</b> preventing accidental disconnects.

So, if there is only one (master) device on the cable, there is no cable stub to cause reflections. Also, cable select is now implemented in the slave device connector, usually simply by omitting the contact from the <b>connector</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
50|$|An 8P8C modular {{connection}} has two paired components: {{the male}} plug {{and the female}} jack, each with eight equally-spaced conductors. On the plug, these conductors are flat contacts positioned parallel with the <b>connector</b> <b>body.</b> Inside the jack, the contacts are suspended diagonally toward the insertion interface. When an 8P8C plug is mated with an 8P8C jack, the contacts meet and create an electrical connection. Spring tension in the jack's contacts ensures a good interface with the plug and allows for slight travel during insertion and removal.|$|E
40|$|Centrin, a 20 -kD phosphoprotein {{with four}} calcium-binding EF-hands, {{is present in}} the centrosome/basal body {{apparatus}} of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in three distinct locations: the nucleus- basal <b>body</b> <b>connectors,</b> the distal striated fibers, and the flagellar transition regions. In each location, centrin is found in fibrous structures that display calcium-mediated contraction. The mutant vfl 2 has structural defects at all of these locations and is defective for basal body localization and/or segregation. We show that the vfl 2 mutation is a G-to-A transition in the centrin structural gene which converts a glutamic acid to a lysine at position 101, the first amino acid of the E-helix of the protein's third EF-hand. This proves that centrin is required to construct the nucleus-basal <b>body</b> <b>connectors,</b> the distal striated fibers, and the flagellar transition regions, and it demonstrates the importance of amino acid 101 to normal centrin function. Based on immunofluorescence analysis using anti-centrin antibodies, it appears that vfl 2 centrin is capable of binding to the basal body but is incapable of polymerizing into filamentous structures. 19 phenotypic revertants of vfl 2 were isolated, and 10 of them, each of which had undergone further mutation at codon 101, were examined in detail. At the DNA level, 1 of the 10 was wild type, and the other 9 were pseudorevertants encoding centrins with the amino acids asparagine, threonine, methionine, or isoleucine at position 101. No ultrastructure defects were apparent in the revertants with asparagine or threonine at position 101, but in those with methionine or isoleucine at position 101, the distal striated fibers were found to be incomplete, indicating that different amino acid substitutions at position 101 can differentially affect the assembly of the three distinct centrin-containing fibrous structures associated with the Chlamydomonas centrosome...|$|R

Furthermore, the cover may connect with the guide arm through a pivot; the cover further comprises a groove. When the second salient block is moved, the first salient block shifts inside the groove and pushes the SIM card out from the accommodating space.|$|R
40|$|In the {{flagellate}} green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii the Ca 2 +-binding EF-hand protein centrin is encoded by a single-copy gene. Previous {{studies have}} localized the protein to four distinct {{structures in the}} flagellar apparatus: the nucleus-basal <b>body</b> <b>connector,</b> the distal connecting fiber, the flagellar transitional region, and the axoneme. To explain the disjunctive distribution of centrin, the interaction of centrin with as yet unknown specific centrin-binding proteins has been implied. Here, we demonstrate using serial section postembedding immunoelectron microscopy of isolated cytoskeletons that centrin is located in additional structures (transitional fibers and basal body lumen) and that the centrin-containing structures of the basal apparatus are likely part of a continuous filamentous scaffold that extends from the nucleus to the flagellar bases. In addition, we show that centrin {{is located in the}} distal lumen of the basal body in a rotationally asymmetric structure, the V-shaped filament system. This novel centrin-containing structure has also been detected near the distal end of the probasal bodies. Taken together, these results suggest a role for a rotationally asymmetric centrin “seed” in the growth and development of the centrin scaffold following replication of the basal apparatus...|$|R
50|$|Glass {{fiber optic}} {{connector}} performance is affected {{both by the}} connector and by the glass fiber. Concentricity tolerances affect the fiber, fiber core, and <b>connector</b> <b>body.</b> The core optical index of refraction is also subject to variations. Stress in the polished fiber can cause excess return loss. The fiber can slide along its length in the connector. The shape of the connector tip may be incorrectly profiled during polishing. The connector manufacturer has little control over these factors, so in-service performance may well be below the manufacturer's specification.|$|E
50|$|The ends of coaxial cables usually {{terminate}} with connectors. Coaxial connectors {{are designed}} to maintain a coaxial form across the connection and have the same impedance as the attached cable. Connectors are usually plated with high-conductivity metals such as silver or tarnish-resistant gold. Due to the skin effect, the RF signal is only carried by the plating at higher frequencies and does not penetrate to the <b>connector</b> <b>body.</b> Silver however tarnishes quickly and the silver sulfide that is produced is poorly conductive, degrading connector performance, making silver a poor choice for this application.|$|E
50|$|Modular {{connectors}} come in four sizes: 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-position, where {{a position}} is a location for a contact. Not {{all of the}} positions may have contacts installed. When contacts are omitted, they are typically done so from the outermost pair of contacts inward, such {{that the number of}} contacts is almost always an even number. The insulating plastic bodies of 4P and 6P connectors have different widths, whereas 8P or 10P connectors share an even larger body width. The <b>connector</b> <b>body</b> positions with omitted contacts or contacts unattached to wires are unused for the electrical connection, but ensure that the plug fits correctly. For instance, RJ11 cables often have connectors with six positions and four contacts, to which are attached just two wires.|$|E
40|$|The antiphosphoprotein {{monoclonal}} antibody MPM- 2 {{was used to}} investigate protein phosphorylation during flagellar regeneration in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. MPM- 2 recognizes a phosphorylated epitope and detects several Chlamydomonas proteins by Western immunoblot analysis. Two MPM- 2 reactive proteins (34 and 90 kD) increase in Western immunoblot intensity after flagellar excision and decrease in intensity during flagellar regeneration. Immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling revealed MPM- 2 staining within the nucleus, especially towards the nuclear periphery, the flagellar basal apparatus, and the nucleus-basal <b>body</b> <b>connector</b> after flagellar excision. Comparison of MPM- 2 reactivity in wild-type cells and in the mutant bald- 2, which lacks functional basal bodies, demonstrates that the 34 -kD protein is localized in the nucleus and the 90 -kD protein is localized in the flagellar basal region. MPM- 2 reactivity is observed in cells competent for flagellar regeneration. However, when cells were treated with the kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, MPM- 2 reactivity did not increase after flagellar excision and flagellar regeneration was impaired. These observations suggest that phosphorylation of the 34 - and 90 -kD proteins may be important for flagellar regrowth. Possible roles for phosphorylation in flagellar regeneration include transcriptional activation and transport of flagellar precursors {{to the base of}} the growing flagella...|$|R

ECENT studies make a strong case for the role of cAMP as a primary signaling agent during the Chlamydomonas mating reaction: sexual adhesion between plus and minus gametes generates an immediate rise in intracellular cAMP levels (Pijst et al., 1984; Pasquale and Goodenough, 1987; Kooijman et al., 1990; Schuring et al., 1991) ...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the gender}} of tubing and {{plumbing}} fittings is usually obvious, {{this may not be}} true of electrical connectors because of their more complex and varying constructions.
