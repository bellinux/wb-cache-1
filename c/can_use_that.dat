25|$|A rarely {{occurring}} and high-scoring {{feature of}} Hong Kong Mahjong is a move called robbing the Kong. If a player declares a Kong (by melding it or adding a fourth piece to a Pong {{to form a}} Kong or declaring a concealed Kong) and another player(s) <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> piece to complete a hand (which by logic {{could not be used}} to form a Pong or Kong as two players cannot make a Pong out of the same tile), a player may steal that piece from that player when declaring the Kong and go Mahjong (win the hand).|$|E
25|$|The Cherokee {{language}} {{is one of}} the few, or perhaps the only, Native American language with an increasing population of speakers, and along with Navajo it is the only indigenous language in the United States with more than 50,000 speakers, a figure most likely achieved through the tribe's 10-year long language preservation plan involving growing new speakers through immersion schools for children, developing new words for modern phrases, teaching the language to non-Indians in schools and Universities, fostering the language among young adults so their children <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> language at home, developing iPhone and iPad apps for language education, the development of language radio stations including Cherokee Voices, Cherokee Sounds, and promoting the writing system through public signage, products like Apple Inc., Internet use through Google including Gmail, and others so the language remains relevant in the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|That Start transit {{requires}} {{the attainment of}} a threshold cell size directly implies that yeast cells measure their own size, so that they <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> information to regulate Start. A favored model for how yeast cells, as well as cells of other species, measure their size relies on the detection of overall translation rate. Essentially, since cell growth consists, to a great extent, of the synthesis of ribosomes to produce more proteins, the overall rate of protein production should reflect cell size. Thus, a single protein that is produced at a constant rate relative to total protein production capacity will be produced in higher quantities as the cell grows. If this protein promotes cell cycle progression (Start {{in the case of}} yeast), then it will link cell cycle progression to translation rate and, therefore, cell size. Importantly, this protein must be unstable, so that its levels depend on its current translation rate, rather than the rate of translation over time. Furthermore, since the cell grows in volume as well as mass, the concentration of this size sensor will remain constant with growth, so its activity must be compared against something that does not change with cell growth. Genomic DNA was suggested as such a standard early on, because it is (by definition) present in a constant quantity until the start of DNA replication. How this occurs remains a major question in current studies of size control (see below).|$|E

500|$|Barton {{does not}} believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles {{is a world of}} false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the {{screenplay}} (filmed, but not included in the theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent tells him: [...] "I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism– [...] if I <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> word and Hollywood in the same breath". Later, as Barton tries to explain why he's staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is [...] "less Hollywood". The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the [...] "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast. Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: [...] "The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: [...] "If your opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let you run the studio. It doesn't, and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum".|$|E

2500|$|Engineering {{is quite}} {{different}} from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people <b>can</b> <b>use.</b> <b>That</b> something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined. [...] In the past engineers working on new designs found {{that they did not have}} all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.|$|E
2500|$|On February 19, 2009, the IAEA {{reported}} that samples {{taken from the}} site revealed new traces of processed uranium. A senior UN official said additional analysis of the June find had found 40 more uranium particles, {{for a total of}} 80 particles, and described it as significant. He added that experts were analyzing minute traces of graphite and stainless steel found at and near the site, but said that it was too early to relate them to nuclear activity. The report noted Syria's refusal to allow agency inspectors to make follow-up visits to sites suspected of harboring a secret nuclear program despite repeated requests from top agency officials. Syria disputed these claims. According to Syria's IAEA representative Othman, {{there would have been a}} large amount of graphite had the building been a nuclear reactor. Othman continued, [...] "They found 80 particles in half a million tonnes of soil. I don't know how you <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> figure to accuse somebody of building such a facility." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{formulas}} that viticulturist and winemakers <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> utilize the various measurements of sugar, acid and pH level. One method developed {{by researchers at}} the University of California-Davis is the Brix:TA ratio which uses the ratio of brix degrees to the TA measurements. For example, a wine with 22°Bx and [...]75 TA will have almost a 30:1 Brix:TA ratio. According to the Davis researchers, the most balanced table wines tend to have a Brix to TA ratio between 30:1 - 35:1. Another method is to multiply the pH reading by itself and then multiply that number by the Brix reading. Using this method, when white wine grapes gets close to 200 and red wine grapes close to 260, it can be a good rule of thumb of when to harvest. For example, white wine grapes have a pH of 3.3 and Brix of 20, after going through that formula they will have a finally number of 217.80 which is well within an acceptable harvest range for some winemakers.|$|E
