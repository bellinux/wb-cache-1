In spring 1973 they started their own farm with five other families, thanks to Rodger McAfee (the same small farmer responsible for sending the $102,000 bail out to Angela Davis in 1972) who leased them 6 acres.They had some success as the first people to grow, sell, and nationally distribute <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes</b> under the label Rancho El Bracero (Also the name of their farm.) They made $64,000 off the sales from the <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> and used that money to purchase land. In 1974, the Lopez-De La Cruz family and three other families decided to purchase 40 acres near Raisin City, CA and started their own cooperative farm selling <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes</b> and other produce to local and national sellers. They attempted to expand their land and acquire some land with water by purchasing land from millionaire farmer Giffen, but he refused to sell any plot for less than a half of a million dollars.|$|E

2500|$|After flowering, {{potato plants}} produce small green fruits that {{resemble}} green <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> each containing about 300 seeds. Like {{all parts of}} the plant except the tubers, the fruit contain the toxic alkaloid solanine and are therefore unsuitable for consumption. All new potato varieties are grown from seeds, also called [...] "true potato seed", [...] "TPS" [...] or [...] "botanical seed" [...] to distinguish it from seed tubers. New varieties grown from seed can be propagated vegetatively by planting tubers, pieces of tubers cut to include at least one or two eyes, or cuttings, a practice used in greenhouses for the production of healthy seed tubers. Plants propagated from tubers are clones of the parent, whereas those propagated from seed produce a range of different varieties.|$|E

At the end of storage at room and cold temperature fruit coated with CHI-OVEO showed higher firmness (> 2 N/mm) and lower weight loss (> 2 %) compared to uncoated tomato fruit. CHI-OVEO coating delayed the decrease of lycopene, ascorbic citric acid, glucose and fructose during the storage time assessed at room or cold temperatures. The increase of catechin, myricetin, caffeic and syringic acids was higher (1 - 9 mg/g) in <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> fruit coated with CHI-OVEO compared to uncoated fruit during the storage at both temperatures studied.

40|$|Hot water dipping (HWD) at a {{range of}} treated {{temperatures}} from 34. 5 to 630 C and exposure times from 10 sec to 210 min were applied to <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> fruits (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Coco) after harvest. During storage at 200 C for ripening, the surface color development of treated tomato fruits was delayed in a particular range of HWD conditions and after that ripped to full red-ripe stage. HWD conditions, in which tomato surface color development was delayed without heat damage, accumulated the effective treatment area (ETA). At red ripe-stage (a*/b * = 1), the qualities such as sugar content, titratable acidity and firmness of tomato fruits treated in an ETA were similar to the control fruits, except for the lower acidity of tomato fruits treated at low temperatures for long exposure times. Those findings suggest that HWD at high temperatures for short times in the ETA were preferred in both color-delay and quality maintenance of <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> fruits. The discovery and utilization of HWD in ETA could have significant benefits for quality management of <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> fruits.

40|$|Ascorbate redox {{metabolism}} and growth {{have been shown}} to be linked and related to the activity of enzymes that produce or remove the radical monodehydroascorbate, the semi-oxidized form of ascorbate (ascorbate oxidase or peroxidase and monodehydroascorbate reductase respectively). Previous work in <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> has revealed correlations between monodehydroascorbate reductase and ascorbate oxidase activity and fruit yield: decreased whole plant MDHAR activity decreases yield while decreased whole plant ascorbate oxidase activity increases yield under unfavourable environmental conditions. We aimed to investigate if similar effects on yield are obtained in a large-fruited variety of tomato, Moneymaker. Furthermore we wished to establish whether previously observed effects on yield in <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> following changes in whole plant enzyme activity could be reproduced by reducing MDHAR activity in fruit only by using a fruit-specific promoter in <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> (West Virginia 106). In Moneymaker, RNAi lines for monodehydroascorbate reductase did not show significant yield decrease compared to control lines when plants were grown under optimal or non-optimal conditions of carbon stress generated by mature leaf removal. In addition, we show that a decrease in monodehydroascorbate reductase activity in fruit of <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> had no effect on yield compared to a reduction in whole-plant monodehydroascorbate reductase activity: we therefore show that whole plant MDHAR activity is necessary to maintain yield in <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato,</b> suggesting that the carbon source in autotrophic tissue is more important than fruit sink activity. The present data also revealed differences between cherry and large fruited tomato that could be linked to a source of genetic variability in the response to monodehydroascorbate metabolism in tomato: maybe the domestication of tomato towards large-fruited lines could have affected the importance of MDHAR in yield maintenance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> is {{a variety}} that is poorly present at Macedonian fields, mainly {{due to the}} {{traditional}} habits of the consumers and the commercial tomato producers to grow tomato varieties with large fruit. <b>Cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> - Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. var. cerasiforme (Dunal) is a tomato variety with small fruit, while having different shapes and colors, and it is used mainly for fresh consumption. The features of this variety are portrayed its sweetness and aroma, which further enriche the taste of food.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the linear relationship between <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> yield components. Two uniformity trials, without treatments, were conducted on Lilli <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> plants in a plastic greenhouse during the 2014 spring/summer season, with the plants in two stems. Variables observed for each plant were mean fruit length, mean fruit width, mean fruit weight, number of bunches, number of fruits per bunch, total number of fruits, and total fruit weight; a Pearson's correlation matrix was used to estimate the relationship between the variables. Path analysis was then performed considering total fruit weight as the main variable and the remaining variables as explanatory. Due to the severe multicollinearity, the variable 'number of fruits per bunch' was eliminated. Pearson's correlation coefficients were significant between explanatory and main variables. Mean fruit weight has a low cause-and-effect relationship with the total weight of fruits produced. A low cause-and-effect relationship was also observed between number of fruits and number of bunches. <b>Cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> productivity is directly related to the number of fruits per plant...|$|R
