30|$|The {{intersection}} process [24] {{is performed}} as follows. Each polygon {{is perceived as}} being formed {{by a set of}} left and right bounds. All the edges on the left bound are left edges, and those on the right are called right edges. Left and right sides are defined with respect to the interior of polygon. Edges are further classified as like edges (belonging to same polygon) and unlike edges (of different types means belongs to two different polygons). The following convention is used to formalize these rules: An edge is characterized by a two-letter word. The first letter indicates whether the edge is left (L) or right (R) edge, and the second letter indicates whether the edge belongs to subject (S) or <b>clip</b> (<b>C)</b> polygon.

40|$|Passive open-top {{chambers}} (OTCs) and rainout shelters (RSs) {{have been}} used for over two decades to manipulate temperature and water availability in experiments on plant communities. These types of manipulations have been independently evaluated; however, as experiments become more complex and multiple factors are evaluated the potential for unknown or undesirable treatment effects increases. We present the effects of temperature manipulations (with OTCs), water manipulations (with RSs and water additions), and a clipping treatment, implemented in a fully factorial design, on soil moisture and temperature over 2 years in a temperate grassland. Temperature was increased 0. 2 C by OTCs. Soil volumetric water content was reduced 3 % by RSs and increased 2 % by watering. However, clipping vegetation, treatment interactions, and weather conditions also affected soil temperature and moisture. For example, in OTCs RSs increased the temperature an additional 0. 4 C, watering lowered it 0. 4 <b>C,</b> and <b>clipping</b> raised temperature 2 C. Similarly, changes in soil moisture due to the RSs decreased VWC by 3 % and increased 1 % by clipping whereas soil moisture due to watering was reduced 1 % by the OTCs and clipping. We also found that OTCs are more effective at raising temperatures on cooler days when soil temperatures are below 16. 3 C. Our results suggest that all treatment types generally affect soil variables in predicable ways, but use of such devices should be adopted with caution, as they do not act independently, or exclusively, on the target variables.

40|$|Regulatory {{mechanisms}} of soil respiratory carbon (C) release induced by substrates (i. e., plant derived substrates) {{are critical for}} predicting ecosystem responses to climate change, but the mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we sampled soils from a long-term field manipulative experiment and conducted a laboratory incubation to explore the role of substrate supply in regulating the differences in soil C release among the experimental treatments, including control, warming, clipping, and warming plus clipping. Three types of substrates (glucose, C 3 and C 4 plant materials) were added with an amount equal to 1 % of soil dry weight under the four treatments. We found that the addition of all three substrates significantly stimulated soil respiratory C release in all four warming and clipping treatments. In soils without substrate addition, warming significantly stimulated soil <b>C</b> release but <b>clipping</b> decreased it.

Yet, increased climate variability may be shifting the competitive edge {{back toward the}} natives.

We measured light penetration and soil moisture content in <b>C.</b> nutans monoculture, <b>clipped</b> and non <b>clipped</b> grassland with <b>C.</b> nutans, and bare ground control plots. We also tracked phenology of the invader and grasses. Our studies revealed that light was a limiting resource in normal precipitation years; removing biomass (e. g., clipped grassland plots) allowed C. nutans to successfully establish, while not removing biomass (e. g., nonclipped grassland plots) resulted in premature death. Similarly, soil moisture was a limiting resource when light was abundant; a lack of precipitation in the second year reduced grass growth, which opened the canopy and allowed adequate light for C. nutans seedlings that also died prematurely under extremely low soil moisture levels. We found that C. nutans was unable to compensate for the low light and soil moisture in offsetting, yet consecutive seasons and failed to establish in a nonclipped grassland.

Seedlings {{were subjected to}} shoot removal (clipping) at ages from 9 to 19 weeks, and transferred to the high water treatment for a further 8 weeks to assess shoot emergence from lignotubers. Seedling shoot biomass was greater in both the high than the low nutrient and water treatments, but lignotuber diameter was not affected significantly. C. variegata seedlings had the largest lignotuber diameters, followed by E. siderophloia and E. acmenoides, respectively. Although growth of shoots was influenced by nutrient availability, results suggest that species differences {{in the growth of}} lignotubers was less affected. It is suggested that lignotuber growth was strongly influenced by genotype. More than 70 % of <b>C.</b> variegata seedlings <b>clipped</b> at 9 weeks sprouted, compared with only 5 and 10 % of seedlings of E. siderophloia and E. acmenoides, respectively. All C. variegata seedlings sprouted after being clipped at 19 weeks, but < 80 % of E. siderophloia and < 60 % of E. acmenoides sprouted when clipped at the same age. It was concluded that seedlings forming part of the regeneration stratum in dry sclerophyll forests need to be protected from damage for at least 4 months (for C. variegata) or at least 6 months (for E. siderophloia and E. acmenoides) if they are to survive by sprouting from lignotubers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Ferulic acid (FA) is a {{naturally}} occurring nutritional compound. Although {{it has been}} shown to have antihypertensive effects, its effects on vascular function have not been intensively established. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the vasoreactivity of FA in chronic two-kidney, one-clip (2 K 1 C) renal hypertensive rats. Methods: Hypertension was induced in 2 K 1 <b>C</b> rats by <b>clipping</b> the left renal artery and age-matched rats that received a sham treatment served as a control. Thoracic aortas were mounted in tissue baths to measure isometric tension. The effects of FA on vasodilatory responses were evaluated based on contractile responses induced by phenylephrine in the aortic rings obtained from both 2 K 1 C and sham rats. Basal nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability in the aorta was determined by the contractile response induced by NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME). Results: FA induced concentration-dependent relaxation responses which were greater in 2 K 1 C hypertensive rats than in sham-clipped control rats. This relaxation induced by FA was partially blocked by the removal of endothelium or by pretreating with l-NAME. l-NAME-induced contractile responses were augmented by FA in 2 K 1 C rats, while no significant differences were noted in sham rats. FA improved acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation in 2 K 1 C rats, but not in sham rats. The simultaneous addition of hydroxyhydroquinone significantly inhibited the increase in acetylcholine-induced vasodilation by FA. Conclusion: These results suggest that FA restores endothelial function by altering the bioavailability of NO in 2 K 1 C hypertensive rats. The results explain, in part, the mechanism underlying the vascular effects of FA in chronic renal hypertension...|$|R

STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant ewes (n = 16) at 92 to 104 days of gestation (term, 145 days) underwent amniodistention with Hartmann's solution (group I, n = 8) or nitrous oxide (group II, n = 8) at 38 degrees <b>C.</b> Endoscopic tracheal <b>clipping</b> according to a standardized surgical protocol was performed in all animals. The duration of fetoscopy (from insertion of first cannula until removal of last one), fetal surgery (fetal skin incision to skin closure), and number of bleeding episodes was recorded. Maternal and fetal blood gas values (pH, PO 2, and PCO 2) were measured at baseline and every 15 minutes during the experiment. Videotapes of the operations were assessed independently and scored by a visual analog scale in terms of smoothness of the operation and control of hemorrhagic events. RESULTS: Mean duration of fetoscopy (+/-SEM) (68 +/- 16 minutes vs 92 +/- 23 minutes) and fetal surgery (19 +/- 6 minutes vs 42 +/- 18 minutes) as well as number of bleeding episodes (1. 9 +/- 0. 8 minutes vs 5. 8 +/- 2. 1 minutes) was significantly reduced in animals operated with use of nitrous oxide amniodistention. In both groups, fetal and maternal blood gases remained unchanged during the entire experiment. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were significantly higher for procedures conducted with use of gas distention.

Methods: The study was designed as four different hypertension models. Rats (n= 84) were divided equally into six groups: Control group (C), Sham operated (Sham), Two kidney-one clip (2 K- 1 <b>C),</b> One kidney-one <b>clip</b> (1 K- 1 C), Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and N-omega-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME). Brain TBARS, serum lipids (total and lipoprotein bound cholesterols and triglycerides) CD and TBARS levels and PON 1 activity were assayed. Comparisons were performed using ANOVA or Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis tests. Pearson correlation and linear regression analysis were used to evaluate associations of independent predictors with hypertension. Results: Mean arterial pressure, brain and serum lipid peroxidation markers, VEP latencies were significantly higher in four hypertensive groups compared with control and sham groups (p< 0. 05). Compared with controls, PON 1 activity was decreased in DOCA, 1 K 1 C and L-NAME groups (p< 0. 05). Serum PON 1 activity was negatively correlated with lipid peroxidation markers and VEPs. In terms of VEP's records linear regression analysis showed that changes in N 2 (B= 1. 51 ± 0. 34; p< 0. 001), P 1 (B=- 1. 71 ± 0. 28; p< 0. 001), P 3 (B= 0. 54 ± 0. 14; p< 0. 001), serum TBARS levels (B= 0. 94 ± 0. 24; p< 0. 001) and PON 1 activity (B= 0. 05 ± 0. 02; p< 0. 01) were independently associated with elevated blood pressure.

40|$|Responses of {{ecosystem}} carbon (C) fluxes to human disturbance and climatic warming will affect terrestrial ecosystem C storage and feedback to climate change. We conducted a manipulative experiment {{to investigate the}} effects of warming and clipping on soil respiration (Rs), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross ecosystem production (GEP) in an alpine meadow in a permafrost region during two hydrologically contrasting years (2012, with 29. 9 % higher precipitation than the long-term mean, and 2013, with 18. 9 % lower precipitation than the long-tem mean). Our results showed that GEP was higher than ER, leading to a net C sink (measured by NEE) over the two growing seasons. Warming significantly stimulated ecosystem C fluxes in 2012 but did not significantly affect these fluxes in 2013. On average, the warming-induced increase in GEP (1. 49 µ mol m(- 2) s(- 1)) was higher than in ER (0. 80 µ mol m(- 2) s(- 1)), resulting {{in an increase in}} NEE (0. 70 µ mol m(- 2) s(- 1)). Clipping and its interaction with warming had no significant effects on <b>C</b> fluxes, whereas <b>clipping</b> significantly reduced aboveground biomass (AGB) by 51. 5 g m(- 2) in 2013.
