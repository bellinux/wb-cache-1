5|$|In New York, Kilo and Lily {{land in the}} Downzone {{where the}} unchipped, lower-class {{population}} lives. After they split up and head towards Eurocorp HQ, Kilo is betrayed by Lily and is sent into a trap with EMP mines, injuring him and disabling his chips. After his chips regain function, Kilo is given orders to either capture or kill Lily. After fighting off subverters, Kilo learns their leader Kris—Lily's ex-boyfriend and colleague—is responsible for instigating a war between the syndicates. Kris reveals he started the war so he could hack into the dataverse and kill the syndicates and their chipped populations as punishment for abandoning the unchipped. Lily, who wants to find a peaceful solution and make the syndicates <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> unchipped, opposes the idea. Kilo fights Kris, who attempts to suicide bomb him but kills himself instead. Kilo apprehends Lily; he can either kill her or release her. Lily is captured and a barely-alive Kilo is retrieved.|$|E
5|$|Styles went on {{to defend}} the {{championship}} against Petey Williams, while Daniels and Joe competed in a Four-on-Four Tag Team Elimination X match at Genesis. Styles retained the title at the event, while Daniels and Joe's team were the victors in their contest. After Daniels and Joe won their match, Joe assaulted Daniels by bashing him {{over the head with}} a steel chair and slamming him on a steel chair back-first. Daniels was sidelined with an injury in the storyline {{as a result of these}} action. Thereafter, Joe proceeded to carry around a blood stained towel from the attack. Joe's action at Genesis angered Styles in the storyline, as Styles accused Joe of violating the unwritten code of the TNA X Division. Styles followed by challenging Joe to a match at Turning Point for the TNA X Division Championship on the November19, 2005 episode of Impact!, which Joe accepted. On the December3, 2005 episode of Impact!, Joe attacked Styles, claiming he did not <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> X Division code.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} use other Batman characters in the game, but these were removed when it was decided they would not work within the story. For example, Batman's enemy Mr. Freeze did not fit because the character has different motivations to the Joker. Unlike the Riddler, who is obsessed with proving his superiority over Batman, Mr. Freeze does not hold a personal grudge against Batman, and Mr. Freeze would not <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> other villains' plans. A garden maze under Poison Ivy's control was considered as a location; she could grow it in different directions. In its center, Batman would find the Mad Hatter hosting a tea-party, but the developers decided these ideas would not match the game's tone. Batman's vehicles, the Batmobile and Batwing, were considered {{for inclusion in the}} game, but developing unique control mechanics and gameplay segments for them would have taken too much time, and compromised its quality; the vehicles appear in the game, but players cannot control them.|$|E

25|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, {{he shook his head}} in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E

I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> beauty of the book.|$|E
25|$|Ian McTeague (Charles Napier) - A corrupt greedy businessman. He {{started up}} an illegal mining {{operation}} near the mountain, {{where he and}} his men believe that there is gold for them to dig. As they do so, they use the water from the river to irrigate their operation, where they separate the dirt from ore with chemicals, which are then later spilled out into the rest of the river heading towards the jungle. Because of this, it has caused a plague among the animals drinking it (even Tantor almost fell victim to it). Even the Waziri tribe fell victim to the plague, as they used the river for their crops and drinking. Needless to say, McTeague doesn't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> toxicity of the chemicals and continues dumping them into the river, as he still wants to be rich. Upon learning about the mine, Tarzan and his friends ally with the Waziri tribe to build a dam to block the river and then break it down to have the rushing water destroy the whole mine operation for good, leaving the river fresh and clean again. McTeague and his men then leave in a huff, but not after McTeague angrily swears revenge against Tarzan and the Waziri tribe for ruining his mining operation.|$|E
25|$|In February 1985, Tony secures {{himself a}} job renovating The Queen Victoria public house {{and gives the}} {{unemployed}} Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) a job as his aid. It is whilst he is working here that Tony gains {{the interest of the}} married landlady Angie Watts (Anita Dobson). Angie has grown tired of her cheating husband, Den (Leslie Grantham), and whilst he is away on a holiday in Spain with his lover, Angie seduces Tony and the two embark on an affair. Tony takes the relationship seriously, but Angie is only using him to get back at Den and make him jealous. The affair is conducted in secret, but after Angie initiates a kiss in The Vic with Tony, she is caught by her daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean). Angie is forced to use bribery in order to keep her daughter from informing her husband, and even informs her about Den's current infidelity. Upon Den's return Angie calls off the affair but it isn't long before Sharon tells her father that Angie has been unfaithful. Unfortunately for Angie, Den cares more about his reputation than her and tells her that he doesn't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> affair, so long as it is done discreetly. Tony is very hurt by the whole ordeal, but he is even more concerned for his own safety, should Den find out that it was him his wife was seeing. Fortunately for Tony his identity is never disclosed.|$|E

25|$|Ecology in {{the narrow}} sense refers to the {{biological}} science of ecology. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms {{have to do with}} the way we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly take account of the role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes. Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriated because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to be the best way to start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure to <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.|$|E
25|$|For his {{entrance}} {{prior to}} the main event Myzteziz was lowered from the ceiling wearing a harness, holding a pose {{similar to that of}} Ethan Hunt (portrayed by Tom Cruise) from the first Mission Impossible movie. Once he landed on the ground and was unhooked he revealed a half black/half white version of his normal wrestling gear, alluding to comments made {{prior to the}} show that he may or may not work as a tecnico for the match. Initially Rey Mysterio Jr. took control of the match, much to Myzteziz's frustration, with Myzteziz only gaining control of the match by using punches, kicks and other rudo tactics. This drew boos from the crowd as they were vocally behind Rey Mysterio Jr. At one point during the match Myzteziz slammed Rey Mysterio Jr. onto of the English Language commentator's table, and at another point he suplexed Mysterio Jr. out of the ring, through a table. At one point Rey Mysterio Jr. threw Myzteziz into one of the ring posts, making it look like Myzteziz hit his head on the metal. While the cameras were focusing on Rey Mysterio Jr. Myzteziz made it look like the impact had cut his forehead open as blood (or a similar red substance) covered the white portion of his mask. Once the two wrestlers returned to the ring Rey Mysterio Jr. started to tear at Myzteziz's mask, tearing it open around the eye holds. Late in the match Rey Mysterio Jr. managed to apply Myzteziz's finishing hold, the La Mistica Fujiwara armbar, on Myzteziz but did not gain a submission from the move. Later on Mysterio Jr. managed to apply La Mistica once more, this time with Myzteziz being forced to tap out. As Mysterio Jr. celebrated on the floor Averno, Pentagón Jr. and Joe Lider ran to the ring to attack Myzteziz while he was down. When Rey Mysterio Jr. noticed the attack he entered the ring and helped Myzteziz fight off the rudo trios. When Mysterio Jr. offered a handshake Myzteziz spit a liquid in Mysterio's eyes and then declared that he did not <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fans or Rey Mysterio Jr. He later challenged Mysterio to put his mask on the line in a Luchas de Apuestas match. As the show went off the air Myzteziz declined to join Konnan's La Sociedad, stating he was on his own.|$|E
