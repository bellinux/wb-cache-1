5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50–60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E

25|$|Both Atlamál and Atlakviða are {{referred}} to as Greenlandic poems in the Codex Regius. Most scholars believe Atlakviða to be older than the Norse colony in Greenland and reject a Greenlandic origin for that poem. Atlamál, on the other hand, is believed to be of an age consistent with composition in Greenland. Moreover, some aspects of the poem itself are suggestive of Greenland. In particular one of Kostbera's ominous dreams has a realistic description of a polar bear. The grim tone of the poem is also <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> is known of the Greenland settlement. The relatively mean conditions of the chieftains in the poemthe Niflungar, for example, have only 10 retainershave also been taken as strengthening the case for an origin in Greenlandic culture.|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} the tolerability of adding docetaxel to radiation therapy {{in patients with}} a rising PSA post prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Study design: Phase II study of the combination of docetaxel and radiation therapy. Place and duration of study: University and Veterans Association Hospital from 2007 - 2009. Methodology: Patients eligible to receive “salvage” radiation therapy were enrolled in a prospective study to receive concomitant weekly docetaxel (20 mg/m 2) and then 4 cycles of full dose (75 mg/m 2) docetaxel. Results: All 19 patients were able to complete the concomitant therapy, with just one patient not receiving all 7 cycles of weekly chemotherapy (missing one). Sixteen of 19 completed all four cycles, 2 completed 3 cycles and 1 completed 1 cycle of full dose docetaxel. During combined treatment, there were 3 transient grade 3 toxicities (diarrhea, hemoglobin decline, and hyperglycemia). There was no grade 4 toxicity. During full dose docetaxel, 3 patients suffered a grade 3 decline in WBC count and 2 went on to grade 4. Other single incidents of grade 3 toxicity were anxiety, fatigue, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, port infection and abscess. All the toxicities were transient. By the end of treatment, 89 % had a decline in PSA. Conclusion: This is the first report of combined docetaxel and radiation in the post prostatectomy setting. Patients tolerated the combined treatment very well. Toxicities of the full dose docetaxel are <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>what’s</b> {{reported in the literature}} and appear tolerable...|$|R

25|$|This {{pattern is}} <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> {{is known about}} the effects of hypoxia, a {{shortage}} but not a total absence of oxygen. However, hypoxia cannot have been the only killing mechanism for marine organisms. Nearly all of the continental shelf waters would have had to become severely hypoxic to account for the magnitude of the extinction, but such a catastrophe would make it difficult to explain the very selective pattern of the extinction. Models of the Late Permian and Early Triassic atmospheres show a significant but protracted decline in atmospheric oxygen levels, with no acceleration near the P–Tr boundary. Minimum atmospheric oxygen levels in the Early Triassic are never less than present day levels—the decline in oxygen levels does not match the temporal pattern of the extinction.|$|E

30|$|Another major {{impediment}} to implementing diversity {{work is the}} issue of ethicality. In any of the pre-scientific paradigms, ethicality is straightforward. God(s) or their messengers tell you what is right and you either do that or you don’t and suffer the consequences. Sometimes the alter-enlightenment paradigms (e.g. Islamic science) work similarly, or sometimes they incorporate a more complex set of guiding principles (e.g. Chinese Buddhism). In post-enlightenment societies, ethicality can also be a straightforward matter: a positivist paradigm encourages absolute ethical positions based on authority, although not necessarily a supernatural authority. Obviously, these ethical positions are <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> ethnocentrism—I know <b>what</b> is right and it’s right for you, too (since we all live the same absolute reality).|$|R

Falk et al. (2007) conclude that the onus is now upon the critics that continue to claim microcephaly to produce a brain of a microcephalic that bears resemblance to the floresiensis brain.|$|E
25|$|The {{author of}} the De medicamentis is most likely the Marcellus who was {{appointed}} magister officiorum by Theodosius I. The heading of the prefatory epistle identifies him as a vir inlustris, translatable as “a distinguished man,” but a more formal designation of rank that indicates he had held imperial office. Marcellus’s 16th-century editor Janus Cornarius gives the unhelpful phrase ex magno officio (something like “from high office”); coupled with two references in the Theodosian Code to a Marcellus as magister officiorum, Cornarius’s phrase has been taken as a mistaken expansion of the standard abbreviation mag. off. The magister officiorum {{was a sort of}} Minister of the Interior and the identification is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> is known of the author’s life and with the politics of the time.

Parents' perceptions of available options reflect <b>consistent</b> discrepancy <b>with</b> <b>what</b> they wish were possible.

40|$|Wikipedia is {{commonly}} {{viewed as the}} main online encyclope-dia. Its content quality, however, has often been questioned due to the open nature of its editing model.
