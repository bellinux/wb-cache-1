50|$|The {{system was}} built by the National Electric Construction Company (NEC), which owned other systems in England, using the Dolter system of stud <b>contact</b> <b>power</b> supply (the reason given for this being the unsightliness of {{conventional}} overhead wiring) and public services began on Wednesday 6 February 1907 with a route linking College Square, Rotherham and Parkgate, this being extended to the company’s Dale Road depot in Rawmarsh three days later. The remainder of the line opened on 3 August. In the Dolter system the current was supplied from metal studs placed between the rails that became live and rose from the road to energize the motors of the tram passing over, being then supposed to become dead. This proved unsatisfactory since on occasions the studs remained upright and live so that horses following the tram hauling drays could receive an electric shock. In August 1908, following instructions from the Board of Trade, the company converted their system to overhead pick-up.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Thermal energy {{generated}} by the friction between the disc and pad is transferred to both components and causes thermal expansion of material of each component, and futher affects the friction contact condition. This is the main factor of the thermoelastic instability (TEI) of a disc brake. In this study, TEI is analyzed using the finite element analysis technique. Three dimensional thermo-mechanical analysis model of the disc brake system is created. An intermediate processor based on the staggered approach is used to exchange analysis results: temperature, friction <b>contact</b> <b>power,</b> nodal displacement and deformation. Disc thickness variation (DTV) and temperature distribution of the disc are calculated, and the tendency and meaning of the results are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal SAE International Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems and the definitive published version is available at [URL] Presented at the 9 th International Styrian Noise, Vibration & Harshness Congress: The European Automotive Noise Conference, Graz, Austria, June 22 - 24, 2016. Efficiency and durability are key areas {{of research and development}} in modern racing drivetrains. Stringent regulations necessitate the need for components capable of operating under highly loaded conditions whilst being efficient and reliable. Downsizing, increasing the power- to-weight ratio and modification of gear teeth geometry to reduce friction are some of the actions undertaken to achieve these objectives. These approaches can however result in reduced structural integrity and component durability. Achieving a balance between system reliability and optimal efficiency requires detailed integrated multi-disciplinary analyses, with the consideration of system dynamics, contact mechanics/tribology and stress analysis/structural integrity. This paper presents an analytical model to predict quasi-static <b>contact</b> <b>power</b> losses in lubricated spur gear sets operating under the Elastohydrodynamic regime of lubrication. Tooth Contact Analysis (TCA) is used to predict variations in contact loads, local surface curvature and rolling and sliding velocities. This is combined with an extrapolated oil film thickness formula available in literature, to predict instantaneous lubricant film thickness and sub-surface stresses. Subsequently, viscous and boundary friction are estimated, enabling calculation of power losses. The presented methodology has been used to investigate the effects of parabolic tip relief on power loss and induced sub-surface stresses. The results of this investigation are also presented...|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} metropolitan morning newspapers in Sweden {{and their relationship}} with advertisers. Various forces in society have led to changes in partnerships between metropolitan newspapers and advertisers, which have previously only had small amounts of data. In these particular newspapers, {{it is common to}} find editorial advertisement supplements. The reason these supplements are included, their benefits and how they can affect the paper’s credibility have not previously been investigated. I have researched how the changed collaborations between the metropolitan morning newspapers and advertisers look today; including the <b>contact,</b> <b>power</b> and dependence they have on one another. I have also examined the newspaper’s advertising departments affect the credibility of the journalistic product linked to the editorial advertisement supplements. I have furthermore examined the trends and tendencies of advertisement in metropolitan newspapers. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the phenomena I have investigated and based on my findings give an overall perspective of how it looks in general at metropolitan morning newspapers; there similarities, differences and what these depend upon. For the purpose of being objective and not allowing personal opinions ruin the reliability of my research, I have chosen to interview two persons at each of the newspapers that I selected. This is justified by the fact that decisions concerning partnerships with advertisers and evaluations of advertisements potential impact on the credibility are rarely taken by a single employee. The results from my research regarding metropolitan morning newspaper’s relationship with advertisers can, in some cases, be linked to changes that have occurred in society. In other situations, decisions were made internally at the papers regarding their relationships and amount of cooperation. The results, although partly predicted, have shown surprises that were not anticipated. Overall, it provides a picture of how the relationships and the cooperation between the newspapers and advertisers exist today, and to some extent, how it might look in the future...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} has been devised {{for measuring the}} relative humidity levels in the protective helium/water vapor atmosphere in which the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the Bill of Rights are encased behind glass panels {{on display at the}} National Archives in Washington, DC. The technique is noninvasive: it does not involve penetrating the encasements (thereby risking contamination or damage to the priceless documents) to acquire samples of the atmosphere. The technique could also be applied to similar glass encasements used to protect and display important documents and other precious objects in museums. The basic principle of the technique is straightforward: An encasement is maintained at its normal display or operating temperature (e. g., room temperature) while a portion of its glass front panel is chilled (see Figure 1) until condensed water droplets become visible {{on the inside of the}} panel. The relative humidity of the enclosed atmosphere can then be determined as a known function of the dew point, the temperature below which the droplets condense. Notwithstanding the straightforwardness of the basic principle, careful attention to detail is necessary to enable accurate determination of the dew point. In the initial application, the affected portion of the glass panel was cooled by contact with an aluminum plate that was cooled by a thermoelectric module, the exhaust heat of which was dissipated by a heat sink cooled by a fan. A thermocouple was used to measure the interior temperature of the aluminum plate, and six other thermocouples were used to measure the temperatures at six locations on the cooled outer surface of the glass panel (see Figure 2). Thermal grease was applied to the aluminum plate and the thermocouples to ensure close thermal <b>contact.</b> <b>Power</b> was supplied to the thermoelectric module in small increments, based on previous laboratory tests. A small flashlight and a magnifying glass were used to look for water droplets condensing on the inner surface of the glass. The temperature readings of the thermocouples were taken during cool-down and upon observing condensation. In determining the dew point, it was necessary to make a correction for the differences between the temperatures measured on the chilled outer surface of the glass and the temperature of the inner surface, where the condensation took place. The correction was derived from a laboratory test on a measurement setup that was nearly identical, except that the dew location on the inner surface was also instrumented with a thermocouple. The test showed that the temperature at the dew location on the inner surface of the glass panel was 0. 9 C above the temperature determined from the measurements on the chilled outer surface of the panel...|$|E

40|$|Workers risk {{electrocution}} {{when using}} metal ladders around energized, overhead power lines. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has developed recommendations to prevent injuries and deaths while working with metal ladders. A NIOSH {{review of the}} Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) data from 1992 - 2005 identified at least 154 electrocution deaths that resulted from <b>contacting</b> overhead <b>power</b> lines with portable metal ladders (excluding truck-mounted and aerial ladders) [NIOSH 2007 a]. Of these 154 deaths, 36 involved a person of Hispanic origin (CFOI data for all years exclude New York City; the data for 2005 are preliminary). Although Hispanic workers accounted for 23 %) of these electrocution deaths due to ladders <b>contacting</b> <b>power</b> lines, {{it is estimated that}} they made up only 11 % of the workforce during this period [NIOSH 2007 b]. The NIOSH Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) Program is designed to identify, study, and prevent fatal occupational injuries [www. cdc. gov/niosh/face]. A review of NIOSH FACE cases between 1987 and 2007 identified 11 investigations involving the deaths of 12 workers that occurred while working around overhead power lines and using metal ladders. Ladder <b>contacts</b> with <b>power</b> lines usually occurred during erection, lowering, or relocation of the ladder. The surveillance data indicate a disproportionate rate of deaths among Hispanic workers involved in incidents related to metal ladders making <b>contact</b> with over-head <b>power</b> lines. Recent investigations of Hispanic worker deaths have also highlighted the need for worksite surveys and hazard controls and identified additional safety measures for workers whose primary language is not English.
