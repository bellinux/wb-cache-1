The season follows the club through a loss at the Sectionals competition (episode 9) and subsequent reinstatement when the winning Dalton Academy Warblers were found to have used banned substances (human growth hormone) (episode 12) before winning at the Regionals competition (episode 22), which meant they would be attending their third consecutive National show choir competition. In the meantime, Rachel Berry and Kurt Hummel navigate NYADA and their lives as aspiring performers, plus their relationships with Finn and Blaine. Issues during the season include sex, bulimia, gender identity, <b>child</b> <b>molestation,</b> dyslexia, school violence, and pregnancy scares.

The authorities re-interviewed some of the victims and worked with the Internet blogger who brought the information to light.

50|$|The book is narrated {{in three}} parts: Alice narrates {{the first part}} looking back a year later to {{describe}} their lives immediately before and after Lizzy’s death; Howard narrates the second part describing his struggles while Alice is in prison, and Alice again narrates the third part describing her release on bail and the subsequent trial. In speaking, Alice has a habit of making off-beat, eccentric observations, which Howard finds annoying, but which also lends her narration an air of tragicomedy. Howard describes his increasing desperation that leads him to bond with Theresa, but then to sell their beloved farm {{to raise funds for}} Alice’s release on bail. Alice’s trial for molestation highlights the workings of the legal system and especially the hysteria that can arise from accusations of mass <b>child</b> <b>molestations.</b> While Alice is ultimately acquitted, she and Howard know that their lives can never be fully mended. The power of forgiveness is one of the central themes throughout the book. Alice is unable to forgive herself after Lizzy’s drowning even while Theresa finds it in her heart and faith to forgive Alice.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{number of}} reports have {{emphasized}} the lack of physical aggression and violence used by incest offenders despite {{evidence to the contrary}} from victims. The current study investigated the extent of sexual and nonsexual violence committed by incest offenders against members of their family. Two groups of offenders (38 incest offenders and 52 non-sex offenders) were compared on ratings of threats, violence, and amounts of physical aggression used in their index offenses as well as outside of their index offenses within their homes. The results of the study revealed that a large percentage of both groups of offenders used physical, nonsexual violence directed towards both partners and children within their homes. The results of this study are discussed in terms of viewing incest in isolation from other behaviours and the protection of incest victims. Increased concern about and interest in child abuse has resulted in an expansion of knowledge and understanding of all forms of abuse, including sexual abuse. Incest, or intrafamilial sexual abuse, is widely believed to be {{the most common form of}} <b>child</b> sexual <b>molestation,</b> although estimates o...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{traces the}} causes of the sexual abuse of females, {{particularly}} father-perpetrated rape, in rigid patriarchal communities in Montana, Mexico, and Utah. Based on 15 years of research among fundamentalists in the Intermountain West (Bennion 1997, 2004), the predicting variables were found to consist of 1) a male supremacist ideology that is sanctioned by both scriptural and economic prerogatives, 2) female circumscription, which is the geographic and social isolation of women and children from the mainstream, and 3) economic deprivation, leading to an increase in male underemployment and general dissatisfaction with their masculine role. It is my premise that the combination of these factors within contemporary millenarian fundamentalist movements contribute to the expression of <b>child</b> sexual <b>molestation</b> and domestic violence against women. The Nature and Cause of Sexual Abuse Human males are not unique in the animal kingdom in their ability to maintain sexual arousal and copulate with unwilling female victims. Certainly, there are other creatures which are capable of rape [...] such as the scorpionfly that has identified a clamp {{on the top of the}} male’s abdomen as an adaptation specifically for rape (Wilson 2000).

40|$|Quantitative {{research}} on paedophiles does not capture the psychological meaning of <b>child</b> sexual <b>molestation</b> for the perpetrators. This qualitative study attempted {{to address this}} aspect by exploring the subjective meaning of paedo-philic experience for identified child molesters. Data derived from transcribed open-ended interviews with six identified paedophiles were analysed using an empirical phenomenological methodology. The results challenge traditional stereotypes of child molesters, and show this sample or paedophilic behaviour to originate {{from a range of}} non-sexual motives primarily related to unmet childhood needs for parental affection and affirmation. In this group, pervasive feelings of inadequacy and rejection, stemming from motionally neglectful or abusive parenting, results in the paedophile-to-be renouncing the dangerous world of adult sexuality, and turning to children as substitute sources of emotional and physical intimacy. The paedophile misinterprets children's emotional responsiveness as erotic interest, and takes great risks in his compulsive sexual pursuit of children. The child's gender is unimportant as the paedophile is driven primarily by the need for affirmation and affection. Although he avoids physically hurting his victims, the paedophile is unable to acknowledge that they might be psychologically harmed by his actions. * To whom correspondence should be addressed 15 Most sexual offences elicit social opprobrium, but child sexua...|$|R

The Romans immediately drew their swords, and rushed forward, each to secure his own prize. A scene of the greatest excitement and confusion ensued. The whole company of visitors perceived of course that some great act of treachery was perpetrated upon them, but they were wholly in the dark in respect to the nature and design of it. They were chiefly unarmed, and wholly unprepared for so sudden an attack, and they fled in all directions in dismay, protecting themselves and {{their wives and children}} as well as they could, as they retired, and aiming only to withdraw as large a number as possible from the scene of violence and confusion that prevailed. The Romans were careful not to do them any injury, but, on the contrary, to allow them to withdraw, and to take away all the mothers and <b>children</b> without any <b>molestation.</b> In fact, it was the very object and design of the onset which they made upon the company, not only to seize upon the maidens, but to drive all the rest of their visitors away.
