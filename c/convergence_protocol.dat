40|$|The {{design of}} {{distributed}} gathering and convergence algorithms for tiny robots has recently received much attention. In particular, {{it has been}} shown that convergence problems can even be solved for very weak, oblivious robots: robots which cannot maintain state from one round to the next. The oblivious robot model is hence attractive from a self-stabilization perspective, where state is subject to adversarial manipulation. However, to the best of our knowledge, all existing robot <b>convergence</b> <b>protocols</b> rely on the assumption that robots, despite being "weak", can measure distances. We in this paper initiate the study of <b>convergence</b> <b>protocols</b> for even simpler robots, called monoculus robots: robots which cannot measure distances. In particular, we introduce two natural models which relax the assumptions on the robots' cognitive capabilities: (1) a Locality Detection (LD) model in which a robot can only detect whether another robot is closer than a given constant distance or not, (2) an Orthogonal Line Agreement (OLA) model in which robots only agree on a pair of orthogonal lines (say North-South and West-East, but without knowing which is which). The problem turns out to be non-trivial, and simple median and angle bisection strategies can easily increase the distances among robots (e. g., the area of the enclosing convex hull) over time. Our main contribution are deterministic self-stabilizing convergence algorithms for these two models, together with a complexity analysis. We also show that in some sense, the assumptions made in our models are minimal: by relaxing the assumptions on the monoculus robots further, we run into impossibility results.

50|$|In {{the user}} plane, LTE and WLAN are {{aggregated}} at the Packet Data <b>Convergence</b> <b>Protocol</b> (PDCP) level. In the downlink, the eNB may schedule PDCP PDUs {{of the same}} bearer to be delivered to the UE either via LTE or WLAN. In order to perform efficient scheduling and to assign packets to LTE and WLAN links in the most efficient manner, the eNB can receive radio information about both links, including flow control indication. In order to avoid changes to the WLAN MAC, LWA uses an EtherType allocated for this purpose, so that LWA traffic is transparent to WLAN AP.|$|E
50|$|The UE (User Equipment) {{interface}} of the RAN (Radio Access Network) primarily {{consists of}} RRC (Radio Resource Control), PDCP (Packet Data <b>Convergence</b> <b>Protocol),</b> RLC (Radio Link Control) and MAC (Media Access Control) protocols. RRC protocol handles connection establishment, measurements, radio bearer services, security and handover decisions. RLC protocol primarily divides into three Modes—Transparent Mode (TM), Unacknowledge Mode (UM), Acknowledge Mode (AM). The functionality of AM entity resembles TCP operation whereas UM operation resembles UDP operation. In TM mode, {{data will be}} sent to lower layers without adding any header to SDU of higher layers. MAC handles the scheduling of data on air interface depending on higher layer (RRC) configured parameters.|$|E
50|$|Cellular networks, such as GSM, UMTS or LTE networks, {{also use}} a MAC layer. The MAC {{protocol}} in cellular networks is designed to maximize the utilization of the expensive licensed spectrum. The air interface of a cellular network is at layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model; at layer 2, it is divided into multiple protocol layers.In UMTS and LTE, those protocols are the Packet Data <b>Convergence</b> <b>Protocol</b> (PDCP), the Radio Link Control (RLC) protocol, and the MAC protocol.The base station has the absolute control over the air interface and schedules the downlink access {{as well as the}} uplink access of all devices. The MAC protocol is specified by 3GPP in TS 25.321 for UMTS and TS 36.321 for LTE.|$|E
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of current Internet usage is data retrieval and information exchange. As a result, the focus has been shifted from the current location-based system to an Information-Centric system, where information can be cached and accessed from anywhere within the network {{rather than from the}} end hosts only. To support this functionality, data must be uniquely identified regardless of the location. Current research efforts in the area of Information-Centric Networks presume the existence of a <b>Convergence</b> Layer <b>protocol</b> that facilitates the functionalities of forwarding, while data caching takes place on a higher-plane. Therefore, this paper proposes a <b>convergence</b> layer <b>protocol,</b> based on the Location/ID Separation Protocol which uses two numbering spaces for data.

Therefore, it does not address issues like routing or congestion control. It was originally designed to support “long-haul” transmission in an interplanetary network; its design is based on experiences with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP).

40|$|The use of {{wireless}} communications networks has gained phenomenal momentum, {{resulting in the}} widespread deployment and expansion {{of wireless}} network infrastructure. The dynamic and unpredictable environment characteristic of wireless ad-hoc networks coupled with the scarcity of wireless network resources, limit and may even preclude the use of conventional subnet configuration protocols like the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [1]. The problem of autoconfiguration is further exacerbated by the high degrees of mobility in ad-hoc networks. The Dynamic Registration and Configuration Protocol (DRCP) [2] is an autoconfiguration protocol that has been proposed to overcome these shortcomings and facilitates dynamic, rapid and efficient configuration in the unpredictable adhoc wireless network environment. This paper describes the performance modeling and simulation of the DRCP protocol. More specifically, it helps analyze and answer critical questions related to protocol performance, such as <b>protocol</b> <b>convergence</b> time, <b>protocol</b> overheads, scalability, etc., under realistic operating conditions. Our contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, we analyze protocol performance and provide useful insights into its operation and use in wireless ad-hoc networks. Next, we illustrate the power of modeling and simulation (M&S), since {{the complexity of the}} underlying ad-hoc networks, precludes the use of closed form expressions for analysis.
