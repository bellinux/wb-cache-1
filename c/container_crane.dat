5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} in the Dominican Republic, David turned unexpectedly to the northwest, causing 125 mph (200 km/h) winds in Santo Domingo and Category 5 winds {{elsewhere in}} the country. The storm caused torrential rainfall, resulting in extreme river flooding. The flooding swept away entire villages and isolated communities during the storm's onslaught. A rail-mounted <b>container</b> <b>crane</b> collapsed in Rio Haina at the sea-land terminal. Many roads in the country were either damaged or destroyed from the heavy rainfall, especially in the towns of Jarabacoa, San Cristobal, and Baní.|$|E

25|$|The Virginia Port Authority used a $12 million {{appropriation}} {{from the}} General Assembly to acquire NIT on July 1, 1972.

2500|$|The largest modern {{container}} cranes {{are classified as}} [...] "super-post-Panamax" [...] (for vessels of about 22 or more containers wide). A modern <b>container</b> <b>crane</b> capable of lifting two [...] long containers at once (end to end) under the telescopic spreader will generally have a rated lifting capacity of 65tonnes. Some new cranes have a 120-tonne load capacity, enabling them to lift up to four [...] or two [...] containers. Cranes capable of lifting six 20-foot containers have also been designed. Post-Panamax cranes weigh approximately 800–900tonnes, while the newer-generation super-post-Panamax cranes can weigh 1,600–2,000tonnes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, an {{agreement}} between the VPA and Portsmouth allowed Sea-Land Service, Inc. to construct a terminal on the property of PMT; the new facility used {{about one-third of the}} available space. Sea-Land built a [...] marginal wharf, a paved backup storage area, an office building, a warehouse with 26 loading bays, and a maintenance garage. Sea-Land also purchased a <b>container</b> <b>crane.</b> Sea-Land developed the terminal under a 30-year lease that stipulated {{that at the end of}} the lease the land and facility would revert to the VPA.|$|E
