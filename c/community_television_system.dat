In order to present the results, the text relates three moments: firstly, legal aspects governing the <b>community</b> <b>television</b> <b>system,</b> regulations that have controlled the public television in the country and its effects {{on the development of the}} local community television system; in Colombia; secondly, it delves into the need to understand modes of organization such as economic associations and their collective actions (Network Activities) as co-operative strategies for the work, and thirdly, it raises the role of the <b>community</b> <b>television</b> <b>system</b> as an organ of expression of the communities in this sub-region, struck by violence, exclusion, and the imposed arrival of development. El presente artículo resultado de investigación, expone las diversas realidades que atraviesan los canales comunitarios del Oriente Antioqueño (Colombia). Para presentar los resultados el texto relaciona tres momentos: primero, aspectos jurídicos que en Colombia rigen la Televisión Comunitaria, normativas que ha regido a la televisión pública en el país y sus incidencias en el desarrollo de la televisión comunitaria local; dos, se ahonda en la necesidad de entender los modos de organización como asociaciones económicas y sus acciones colectivas (Actividades en Red) como estrategias co-operativas para el trabajo y tres, plantea el papel de la televisión comunitaria como órgano de expresión de las comunidades de esta subregión golpeada por la violencia, la exclusión y la impuesta llegada del desarrollo...|$|E

50|$|<b>Community</b> antenna <b>television</b> <b>systems,</b> {{also known}} as cable television, have been {{expanded}} to provide bidirectional communication over existing physical cables. However, they are by nature shared systems and the spectrum available for reverse information flow and achievable S/N are limited. As was done for initial unidirectional TV communication, cable loss is mitigated {{through the use of}} periodic amplifiers within the system. These factors set an upper limit on per-user information capacity, particularly when many users share a common section of cable or access network.|$|R

50|$|On February 2016, TV5 Network, Inc {{formally}} filed {{a motion}} for reconsideration with the NTC asking the regulator to dismiss Sky Cable's application to offer DBS and reverse its order last December 2015 that allows Sky Cable to offer both wired and wireless cable network services nationwide. TV5 argued that DBS or wireless cable service {{is beyond the scope}} of Sky Cable’s franchise and articles of incorporation. According to TV5, Sky Cable's amended articles of incorporation states that it can establish and operate a <b>Community</b> Antennae <b>Television</b> (CATV) <b>System</b> which is wired in nature and not a wireless service like DBS.|$|R
50|$|Walson, {{owner of}} a Mahanoy City General Electric {{appliance}} store, needed to solve problems receiving signals from Philadelphia television stations, which were blocked by the mountains surrounding the town. Walson erected an antenna on a utility pole on a local mountaintop that enabled him to demonstrate the televisions in his store with strong broadcasts coming from the three Philadelphia stations. He connected the antenna to his appliance store via a cable and modified signal boosters. He then connected several of his customers who were located along the cable path. This was the first <b>community</b> antenna <b>television</b> (CATV) <b>system</b> in the United States.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Two-way {{transmission}} of data on broadband <b>community</b> cable <b>television</b> <b>systems</b> is considered in this thesis. A discussion of the data transmission environment is presented which attempts to characterize the channel noise and interference which degrades data transmission performance. The analysis considers channel degradation resulting from additive gaussian noise and various amplitudes and frequencies of sinewave interference which simulate the noise and interference environment {{likely to be found}} on cable systems. To assess the impact of the channel noise and interference, noncoherent binary frequency shift keying (FSK) using frequency discriminator detection was chosen as the basis for a theoretical and experimental investigation. To simplify the analysis, a linear model of frequency discriminator detection is presented which provides useful results in situations where the signal-to-noise ratio is high. The model was tested against laboratory experiments using an idealized FSK data transmission channel with controlled amounts of noise and interference. A comparison of theoretical and experimental results show reasonably good agreement, thus validating the model for certain noise and interference circumstances which are applicable to data transmission on two-way cable <b>television</b> <b>systems.</b> The results show that with an FSK carrier-to-sinewave interference ratio of 6 dB, an increase in carrier-to-noise ratio of approximately 5 dB is required to achieve the same 1 X 10 ⁻⁹ error rate. The usefulness of the study results for predicting FSK data transmission performance can be improved by incorporating empirical statistical data on interference ingress in the return path of the cable system...|$|R
