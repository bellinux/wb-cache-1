5|$|The Avro Museum , based out of CYBW west of Calgary, Alberta, Canada is {{building}} a 2/3rd scale, manned, high performance flying replica of the Avro Arrow (officially known as ARROW II) to Canadian Aviation Experimental Aircraft Regulations {{in order to become}} an airshow demonstration aircraft. Construction began in October 2007, and by 2012 the fuselage was completed and passed its first MDRA inspection, and now has a serial number. Powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney JT-15D-4s, the ARROW II will have a top speed of approximately 500 knots and a range of 1,800 miles. <b>Current</b> <b>projections</b> show a final cost of the project at approximately one million dollars and it is hoped that ground tests will start in about 2016 with the first flight to follow.|$|E
5|$|Two {{populations of}} pallid {{sturgeon}} in the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers of Montana are both {{at risk of}} extinction, and <b>current</b> <b>projections</b> are that wild pallid sturgeon populations in Montana will be extinct by 2018. Though a vigorous stocking effort was implemented in 1996, until pallid sturgeon females reach reproductive maturity sometime after they are 15years of age, recovery efforts in Montana will not be readily measurable. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has been conducting spring pulse water releases from the Tiber Dam every four to fiveyears to try to recreate a semblance of an annual spring flood to restore and rejuvenate downstream floodplains. These pulse releases are done {{in an effort to}} restore suitable habitat for numerous fish species.|$|E

In this paper, a different method for allocating transmission losses to pool market participants is proposed. The proposed method is fundamentally based on decomposition of loss function and <b>current</b> <b>projection</b> concept. The method has been implemented and tested on several networks and one sample summarized in the paper. The {{results show that the}} method is comprehensive and fair to allocating the energy losses of a power market to its participants.

25|$|The Social Security Administration {{projects}} that the demographic situation will stabilize. The cash flow {{deficit in the}} Social Security system will have leveled off {{as a share of}} the economy. This projection has come into question. Some demographers argue that life expectancy will improve more than projected by the Social Security Trustees, a development that would make solvency worse. Some economists believe future productivity growth will be higher than the <b>current</b> <b>projections</b> by the Social Security Trustees. In this case, the Social Security shortfall would be smaller than currently projected.|$|E
500|$|A {{competing}} plan, called The Path to Prosperity, {{was announced}} by House Republicans, led by House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan, on April 5, 2011. This plan would cut $5.8 trillion in spending over ten years, {{but would also}} reduce tax income by $4.2 trillion below <b>current</b> <b>projections.</b> The plan would make no further reduction in defense spending beyond the Obama administration's plan, but would make major changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, which was expected to pass more {{of the cost of}} these programs onto individuals. [...] It would also cut energy research and other applied research and development. This plan was criticized by Democrats for disproportionately cutting programs which benefit the disadvantaged and stifling innovation, while not cutting defense spending further and containing deep tax cuts. The House Republican plan was defeated in the Senate by a margin of 40–57 votes on May 25, 2011, the same day that the Obama budget was also defeated.|$|E

Long-range predictions to 2150 range from a population decline to 3.2 billion in the [...] "low scenario", to [...] "high scenarios" [...] of 24.8 billion. One extreme scenario predicted a massive increase to 256 billion by 2150, assuming the global fertility rate remained at its 1995 level of 3.04 children per woman; however, by 2010 the global fertility rate had declined to 2.52.|$|E

Projection methods show promise for the development of fast structural database search solutions. Projection methods map a structure to a point in a high-dimensional space and compare two structures by measuring distance between their projected points.

However, <b>current</b> <b>projection</b> methods are not practical, partly because they are unable to identify local similarities...|$|R

Our optimization technique computes a spatially-varying projection that respects user-specified constraints while minimizing a set of energy terms that measure wide-angle image distortion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by showing results on a variety of wide-angle photographs, as well as comparisons to standard projections...|$|R

50|$|This {{formula is}} used to move the object until a new update is {{received}} over the network. At that point, {{the problem is that}} there are now two kinematic states: the currently estimated position and the just received, actual position. Resolving these two states in a believable way can be quite complex. One approach is to create a curve (ex cubic Bézier splines, centripetal Catmull-Rom splines, and Hermite curves) between the two states while still projecting into the future. Another technique is to use projective velocity blending, which is the blending of two projections (last known and current) where the <b>current</b> <b>projection</b> uses a blending between the last known and current velocity over a set time.|$|R
