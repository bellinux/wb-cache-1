5|$|A bulk carrier's {{design is}} largely {{defined by the}} cargo it will carry. The cargo's density, also known as its stowage factor, is the key factor. Densities for common bulk cargoes vary from 0.6tons per <b>cubic</b> <b>meter</b> for light grains to 3tons per <b>cubic</b> <b>meter</b> for iron ore.|$|E
5|$|Outer {{space is}} the closest known {{approximation}} to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits. However, even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per <b>cubic</b> <b>meter.</b> By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per <b>cubic</b> <b>meter.</b> The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, {{is an important factor}} in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.|$|E
5|$|According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, {{short-term}} {{exposure to}} platinum salts may cause irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, and long-term exposure may cause both respiratory and skin allergies. The current OSHA standard is 2micrograms per <b>cubic</b> <b>meter</b> of air averaged over an 8-hour work shift. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{has set a}} recommended exposure limit (REL) for platinum as 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{while the}} rates remain constant, wood removal (measured in <b>cubic</b> <b>meters)</b> {{continues}} to dramatically increase annually. Industrialized roundwood {{has increased from}} 3.05 million <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> in 1990 to 4.45 million <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> in 2010; fuelwood has increased from 44.2 million <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> to 75.44 million <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> annually in that same time.|$|R
50|$|Timber {{enterprises}} and their downstream industries made a sizable {{contribution to the}} Mongolian economy, accounting for 10 percent of gross industrial output in 1985. Approximately 2.5 million <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> of timber were cut annually. Fuel wood accounted for about 55 percent of the timber cut, and the remainder was processed by the woodworking industry. In 1986 Mongolia produced 627,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> of sawn timber, of which 121,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> was exported. Lumber also was exported; lumber exports declined dramatically from 104,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> in 1984 to 85,700 <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> in 1985 and to 39,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> in 1986.|$|R
50|$|The {{first episode}} had 31 million <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> of lava flow into Kīlauea Iki with 1 million <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> {{draining}} back. During the following episodes, {{a total of}} 71 million <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> of lava was ejected during a month-long eruption that stopped on December 20, 1959. Only 8 million <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> of lava remained, 63 million <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> of lava drained back into Kīlauea magma reservoir. Often the lava drainback had {{a higher rate of}} flow than the eruptions.|$|R
5|$|The more matter {{there is}} in the Universe, the {{stronger}} the mutual gravitational pull of the matter. If the Universe were too dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the Universe contained too little matter then the expansion would accelerate too rapidly for planets and planetary systems to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded monotonically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our universe has just the right mass density of about 5 protons per <b>cubic</b> <b>meter</b> which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.|$|E
5|$|The LOC {{included}} Launch Complex 39, a Launch Control Center, and a 130 {{million cubic}} foot (3.7 million <b>cubic</b> <b>meter)</b> Vertical Assembly Building (VAB) {{in which the}} space vehicle (launch vehicle and spacecraft) would be assembled on a Mobile Launcher Platform and then moved by a transporter to one of several launch pads. Although at least three pads were planned, only two, designated A and B, were completed in October 1965. The LOC also included an Operations and Checkout Building (OCB) to which Gemini and Apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles. The Apollo spacecraft could be tested in two vacuum chambers capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to , which is nearly a vacuum.|$|E
5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy {{density of the}} Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per <b>cubic</b> <b>meter,</b> including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible matter. Unlike the matter and dark matter, the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.|$|E

25|$|Prices {{for water}} sold by tanker trucks. A <b>cubic</b> <b>meter</b> of water {{supplied}} by a water tanker may {{cost as much}} as 6 Riyals (US$1.50), or about 20 times more than water supplied through the network. Citizens who are not connected to the piped network, who are often poor, pay up to 40 times more for water than connected households. The monthly water bill is about 1 Riyal (US$0.27), compared to an average mobile phone bill of 200 Riyals. The price of a 19 <b>cubic</b> <b>meter</b> tank is 150 SR, and the price of a 30 <b>cubic</b> <b>meter</b> tank is 180 SR.

25|$|A {{cleanroom}} {{or clean}} room is an environment, typically used in manufacturing, including of pharmaceutical products or scientific research, {{as well as}} aerospace semiconductor engineering applications with {{a low level of}} environmental pollutants such as dust, airborne microbes, aerosol particles, and chemical vapors. More accurately, a cleanroom has a controlled level of contamination that is specified by the number of particles per <b>cubic</b> <b>meter</b> at a specified particle size. To give perspective, the ambient air outside in a typical urban environment contains 35,000,000 particles per <b>cubic</b> <b>meter</b> in the size range 0.5μm and larger in diameter, corresponding to an ISO 9 cleanroom, while an ISO 1 cleanroom allows no particles in that size range and only 12 particles per <b>cubic</b> <b>meter</b> of 0.3μm and smaller.|$|E
