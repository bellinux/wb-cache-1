Five of these engines still existed, all of which were fitted with dry sump lubrication. These engines were chosen and considered to be especially useful as the dry sump would lower the vehicle's centre of gravity. The displacement of the V12 was set at 6.2 litres (6222cc) for the XJ220. The engine fitted to the XJ220 concept had titanium <b>connecting</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|E

There wasn't a significant amount of deterioration noted in these early inspections, and when the wheels were jacked off the rails, as they had been 50 years earlier, the axles were found to be freely operable. One morning in January 1980, before the museum opened to the public, museum officials used compressed air to power the cylinders and move the wheels through the <b>connecting</b> <b>rods</b> {{for the first time since}} its last semi-operation.

5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet <b>connecting</b> <b>rods</b> and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Every {{vehicle that}} uses an {{internal}} combustion engine requires at least one <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> depending upon the number of cylinders in the engine. <b>Connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is a structural member in the engine, which transfers reciprocating motion in to rotary motion of crank shaft. The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> while transferring the power from piston to crank shaft takes load from piston due to combustion process in the combustion chamber and inertia forces of the reciprocating parts (piston & <b>connecting</b> <b>rod)</b> due to this the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> may fail. The inertia effect of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> will also reduce the power transmission. Hence the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is analyzed for reducing the inertia effect due to reciprocating parts i. e. <b>connecting</b> <b>rod.</b> In this project the analysis is done on <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> with traditional material i. e. grey cast iron and a new alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) for optimizing the weight to reduce the inertia forces due to <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> for this process pro-e package is used to model the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> & ansys- 11. 0 is used {{to carry out the}} analysis of <b>connecting</b> <b>rod...</b>|$|R

The main function of <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is to transmit the translational motion of piston to rotational motion of crank shaft.

25|$|Another change {{affected}} the stroke, also a technique from the Arab, {{where it had}} been responsible for the engine's failure. A multi-cylinder V engine offers little length for <b>connecting</b> <b>rods.</b> Coatalen's usual solution was to use articulated <b>connecting</b> <b>rods,</b> where one rod runs on the crankshaft journal, but the other acts indirectly, through a journal on the other rod. The difficulty is that this gives a slightly different piston stroke for each bank, leading to unbalance and possible vibration problems, as for the Arab.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parts of an engine system. It fits in between the crosshead and the crankshaft and converts the piston’s reciprocating motion to rotary motion with the crankshaft. The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is subjected to a complex state of loading. High compressive loads and high tensile loads are due to combustion and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod’s</b> mass of inertia, respectively. This is why the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is the most stressed part of an engine system. If the engine is operating, <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> fails, this could cause a critical situation. Therefore, the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> should be able to withstand tremendous load and transmit a great deal of power smoothly. In general, the failure occurs at the big end of <b>connecting</b> <b>rod.</b> Hence, the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod’s</b> big end corner radius was taken as a design variable. Also, three dimensional finite element analyses were performed. From these results, the stress distribution was estimated and the value of the corner radius was optimized...|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} contributors to Fiero engines catching fire. The primary cause {{is thought to}} be a batch of poorly cast <b>connecting</b> <b>rods,</b> produced in GM's Saginaw plant, which failed when the oil level became too low. One theory is that the sports car styling attracted buyers who would drive the car hard, most notably by excessively revving the engine. Another factor was the incorrectly listed three-quart oil capacity; the actual oil capacity is 4.5quarts, but a misprint on the dipstick and in the owner's manual resulted in owners using only three quarts, any leakage or consumption would allow the oil level to decline over time to a dangerously low level. If the proper oil level was not maintained, the bearings could seize, snapping the porous castings of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rods.</b> This could result in a hole being punched in the engine block, allowing oil to spray onto hot exhaust components where it could ignite.|$|E
