5000|$|Tabulators {{built by}} the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1910 census could print their results. Prior to that, {{tabulator}} operators had to write down totals from counter wheels onto tally sheets. IBM developed a series of printing accounting machines, beginning in 1920. The 285 Numeric Printing Tabulator could read 150 cards per minute. The 405, introduced in 1934, could print at 80 lines per minute. It had 88 type bars, one for each print position, with 43 alphanumeric bars on the left, followed by 45 numeric-only bars. The IBM 402 series, introduced after World War II, had a similar print arrangement and was used by IBM in early computing devices, including the IBM <b>Card-Programmed</b> Electronic Calculator.|$|E
50|$|From the IBM Archives http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/reference/faq_0000000011.html:The IBM <b>Card-Programmed</b> Electronic Calculator was {{announced}} in May 1949 as a versatile general purpose computer designed to perform any predetermined sequence of arithmetical operations coded on standard 80-column punched cards. It was also capable of selecting and following one of several sequences of instructions {{as a result of}} operations already performed, and it could store instructions for self-programmed operation. The Calculator consisted of a Type 605 Electronic Calculating Punch and a Type 412 or 418 Accounting Machine. A Type 941 Auxiliary Storage Unit was available as an optional feature. All units composing the Calculator were interconnected by flexible cables. If desired, the Type 412 or 418, with or without the Type 941, could be operated independently of the other machines. The Type 605 {{could be used as a}} Calculating Punch and the punch unit (Type 527) could be operated as an independent gang punch.|$|E
50|$|At the time, IBM calculators were {{programmed}} by plugging and unplugging wires manually {{into large}} panels. The concept of storing {{the program as}} well as data in computer memory was generally called the Von Neumann architecture (although others developed the concept about the same time).IBM had built the experimental stored-program SSEC, but company president Thomas J. Watson favored basing commercial products on punched card technology with manual programming. Hurd hired a team {{who would be the}} first professional computer software writers, such as John Backus and Fred Brooks.The first step was to offer a calculator that could be programmed on punch cards in addition to a manual plugboard. This was the <b>Card-Programmed</b> Electronic Calculator, announced in May 1949. It was essentially a commercialized version of experiments done by Wallace John Eckert and customers at Northrop Corporation, but became a very popular product, shipping several thousand units in various models.|$|E
50|$|The 1946 ENIAC {{had more}} tubes than the SSEC and was faster in some operations, but was {{originally}} less flexible, {{needing to be}} rewired for each new problem. At the end of 1948 a new IBM 604 multiplier was announced, which used newer tube technology that already made the bulky tubes of the SSEC obsolete. By May 1949 the <b>Card-Programmed</b> Electronic Calculator was announced, and shipped in September. It was effectively a much scaled-down version of the SSEC technology to allow customers to perform similar calculations. Even {{by the end of}} 1948, the limited electronic memory of the SSEC was seen as a problem, and IBM soon licensed the Williams tube technology developed on the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine at the Victoria University of Manchester. Subsequent computers would have electronic random access memory, and in fact the ability to execute instructions from processor registers was generally not adopted. The 77-bit wide programming word was also abandoned for fewer bits but much faster operation.|$|E
5000|$|Much of Ken's {{work was}} {{concerned}} with writing programs and doing calculations related to thermonuclear burning, first using human [...] "computers" [...] with desk calculators, then IBM <b>card-programmed</b> calculators (CPCs), and later, with Project Matterhorn, the SEAC computer at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, DC. A SEAC calculation, programmed by Ken {{with the assistance of}} John Toll and the guidance of John Wheeler, provided the final predicted yield of 7 megatons for the Mike test on November 1, 1952. The actual yield was approximately 10 megatons."I was {{aware of the fact that}} Oppenheimer was expressing opposition to the development of the H-bomb, for various reasons, from technical to moral. But I was also an accidental participant in what may have been the critical moment in changing his point of view. In June of '51 there was a meeting of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission a broader gathering that included the GAC meeting at the Institute for Advanced Study. They were meeting in a first floor room on, if I remember correctly, a Sunday morning. Maybe it was a Saturday morning. It was a weekend. was Sunday, June 17. Wheeler was scheduled to make a presentation on the latest results of our calculations on the CPC in New York. I was working every night, all night, that week prior to that meeting trying to get the latest and best results that we could."The night prior to this meeting at the Institute for Advanced Study, I took a morning train down from New York with the latest results, went over to the Matterhorn building, got out a very large piece of paper, maybe about two feet by three feet in size, a large rectangle of paper, and sketched out a graph showing our latest calculation of thermonuclear burning, still very crude of course, because of those calculations, yet extremely encouraging. I then rolled up this large graph and drove over to the Institute and walked up to the first-floor window of the room where the meeting was in progress and either rapped gently on the window or signaled through the window to catch Wheeler's attention. As it happened, Wheeler had just taken the floor. It had just become his turn to speak. He interrupted his speech, walked over to the window, opened it, took from me this large graph, carried it back and pasted it on the blackboard for all to see. And then, at that moment, according to the reports of those who were there, Oppenheimer suddenly decided, 'This does look encouraging. I think they've really got something. It looks like it's going to work after all.'"In the fall of 1952, Ken left project Matterhorn and spent the next six months completing his graduate dissertatation on the collective model of the nucleus. After defending his dissertation in the spring of 1953, and after spending that summer working in Los Alamos, he took up a post-doctoral research appointment at Indiana University, beginning that fall.|$|E

40|$|A general matrix {{method is}} {{developed}} for the solution of characteristic-valueproblems of the type arising in many physical appli-cations. The scheme employed is essentially that of Gauss and Seidel with appropriate modifications to make it applicable to characteristic- “ value problems. An iterative procedure produces a sequence of estimates to the answer; and exlmapolation techniques, based upon previous be-havior of iterants, are utilized in speeding convergence. Theoretically sound limits are placed on {{the magnitude of the}} extrapolation that may be y tolerated. E This matrti method is applied to the problem of finding criticality and neutron fluxes h a nuclear reactor with control rods. The two-dimensional finite-difference appr~tion to the two-group neutron-diffusion equations is treated. Results for this example are indicated. The calculations were performed on the JEM <b>card-programmed</b> SNTROIHJCTION A geneml matrix method is {{developed for the}} solution of calculator. characteristic-vslueproblems of a type srising h many physical appli-cations.

This calculation is made to rely upon Turner’s technique (ref. 3) for assigning a meaning to the ratio of two vectors. Extrapolation techniques are also employed to speed up the conver-gence of the iterative process. One of these is based on Turner’s orig-. ti fo ~ (ref. 3), and the other is a slightly more complicated modification...|$|E
