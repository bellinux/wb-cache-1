40|$|The reuse of {{recycled}} construction and demolition (C&D) waste materials in pavement construction would greatly reduce {{the demand for}} landfill sites and for premium quality quarry materials. Various recycled C&D products can be formed by mixing recycled <b>crushed</b> rock, <b>crushed</b> concrete, <b>crushed</b> brick, <b>crushed</b> glass and quarry produced <b>crushed</b> rocks for use as selected base and subbase materials. While their properties as tested in a laboratory usually meet the VicRoads specifications for quarry produced materials, their constructability and field performance may not be {{exactly the same as}} traditional quarry produced materials.

It also provides results of field density, layer thickness, layer stiffness, pavement deflections and pavement roughness obtained from field testing and field monitoring programs.

Because calcium carbonate, the primary component of these substrates, increases water hardness and pH, these are used most often for hard water species, {{such as those}} for African rift lake cichlids or for saltwater fish and invertebrates. Some invertebrates such as mollusks or stony corals also use the calcium and strontium released. Calcium carbonate substrates are poorly suited to aquaria housing most other freshwater aquarium fish, particularly river species, which are adapted to soft water.|$|R
