Its current name was chosen by <b>consular</b> <b>decree</b> of 30 September 1723. It was drawn in the early eighteenth century, during the {{construction}} of buildings {{to the east of}} the Place Bellecour.|$|E

50|$|By {{a decree}} of 3 January 1800 {{a company of}} Chasseurs à cheval was created. Its {{commanding}} officer was Napoleon's stepson, captain Eugène de Beauharnais, who was promoted major on 5 March. The strength was 4 officers and 113 men, the latter being chosen from the Guides who had returned from Egypt, and 112 were veterans of the Italian Campaign of 1796. The cavalry of the Garde Consulaire, two squadrons of Grenadiers à Cheval and the company of chasseurs, was commanded by Chef de brigade Jean-Baptiste Bessières. In May the company left Paris for Italy. It crossed the Great St Bernard Pass and was heavily engaged {{at the battle of}} Marengo (14 June) losing 70 out of its 115 horses. At the end of the campaign the corps returned to Paris. By a <b>consular</b> <b>decree</b> of 8 September it was augmented, becoming a squadron of two companies (troops) and 234 men.|$|E
50|$|On 14 Nivôse Year IX of the French Republic (January 4, 1801) First Consul Bonaparte {{and his two}} colleagues Cambacérès and Lebrun exiled 130 Jacobins from France. Their <b>consular</b> <b>decree</b> read: 130 {{citizens}} {{whose names}} are indicated, suspect of carrying partial responsibility for the terrorist attempt of 3 Nivôse, {{the explosion of the}} machine infernale, shall be placed under special surveillance outside the European territory of the Republic. On 15 Nivôse (January 5) the docile Sénat ratified this act by issuing a sénatus-consulte certifying that the consuls’ action preserved the constitution. The 130 unfortunate suspects were deported from France without trial and without the right of appeal. Napoleon increasingly acted as if he had the power to do anything he wished. Two days later, on 17 Nivôse, he named , the future comte de Melito, the administrateur général of the two Corsican départements of the Golo and the Liamone, where anti-bonapartiste sentiment was strong and where Bonaparte had suspended constitutional rule. The Christian date was January 7 - Joseph Bonaparte’s 33rd birthday.|$|E
5000|$|One of Napoleon's most quoted {{lines is}} his dictum that [...] "An army is a {{creature}} which marches on its stomach". This clearly illustrates the vital importance of military logistics. The {{troops of the}} Grande Armée each carried 4 days' provisions. The supply wagon trains following them carried 8 days', but these were to be consumed only in emergency. One man was allotted to 750 grams of bread, 550 grams of biscuits, 250 grams of meat, 30 grams of rice, and 60 grams of grain; one liter of wine was shared between four men. Insofar as possible, Napoleon encouraged his men to live off the land through foraging and requisition of food (which was known as La Maraude). An {{integral part of the}} French logistics system was the inclusion in every regiment of several women known as cantinières (also known as vivandières, but [...] "cantinière" [...] was by far the more common term among French troops). These women were married to soldiers in their regiments, and acted as sutlers, selling food and drink (especially alcohol) to the troops. They were considered [...] "absolutely necessary" [...] to the functioning of the army, and the <b>Consular</b> <b>Decree</b> of 7 Thermidor, Year VIII set their number at four per battalion and two per cavalry squadron. [...] These women fed the troops when all other logistical arrangements broke down.|$|E
