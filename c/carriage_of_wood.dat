50|$|As the horse-drawn {{carriage}} {{was replaced}} by the car and lorry or truck, and speeds increased, the need for smoother roads and less vertical displacement became more apparent, and pneumatic tires were developed to decrease the apparent roughness. Wagon and <b>carriage</b> wheels, made <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> had a tire {{in the form of an}} iron strip that kept the wheel from wearing out quickly. Pneumatic tires, which had a larger footprint than iron tires, also were less likely to get bogged down in the mud on unpaved roads.|$|R
50|$|The <b>carriages</b> <b>of</b> {{those days}} were built <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> or wicker and held {{together}} by expensive brass joints. These sometimes became heavily ornamented works of art.

5000|$|Carriages may be {{enclosed}} or open, {{depending on}} the type. [...] The top cover for the body <b>of</b> a <b>carriage,</b> called the head or hood, is often flexible and designed to be folded back when desired. Such a folding top is called a bellows top or calash. A hoopstick forms a light framing member {{for this kind of}} hood. The top, roof or second-story compartment <b>of</b> a closed <b>carriage,</b> especially a diligence, was called an imperial. A closed carriage may have side windows called quarter lights (British) as well as windows in the doors, hence a [...] "glass coach". On the forepart <b>of</b> an open <b>carriage,</b> a screen <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> or leather called a dashboard intercepts water, mud or snow thrown up by the heels of the horses. The dashboard or carriage top sometimes has a projecting sidepiece called a wing (British). A foot iron or footplate may serve as a carriage step.|$|R
50|$|Electric {{railways}} {{began in}} Britain in 1883 {{and the first}} EMU ran on the Liverpool Overhead Railway in 1893. In the early 20th century systems were developed where all the motors on a train could be controlled by a low voltage signal from any cab. Due to problems using steam locomotives underground, the underground railways in London and Liverpool were early adopters of 600V DC electric traction and by 1907 underground railways in London and some provincial cities were running electric trains. A 6.7 kV 25 Hz overhead system was also used from 1908. After the railway companies were grouped in 1923, the Southern Railway greatly expanded the 3rd rail DC electrification, replacing some early AC electrification. Overhead lines at 1500 V DC were planned and installed just {{before and after the}} second world war. The early EMU carriages, similar to contemporaneous locomotive-hauled <b>carriages,</b> were constructed <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> with hinged doors with accommodation in saloons or compartments. As time went on more steel became to be used in carriage construction.|$|R

40|$|It is {{expected}} that the massive expansion <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods {{that went on in}} past couple of decades will soon resume after the worldwide recession.

The transport <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> and wood products was particularly important. The most important customers for freight for decades were the Krauth & Co. sawmill (at the time Württemberg's largest sawmill) at the former Rotenbach station and the timber yard in the Eyach valley.|$|R

40|$|During {{a two-year}} period from January 1979, 260 {{patients}} {{have been involved in}} an outbreak <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> and infection due to gentamicin-resistant enterobacteria. We have examined the duration <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> such enterobacteria and have compared the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> Klebsiella with that of other resistant enterobacteria. <b>Carriage</b> <b>of</b> gentamicin-resistant enterobacteria occurred most frequently and was least sporadic in the intestinal tract.
