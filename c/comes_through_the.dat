5|$|Prior to March 18, 2014, 13 was {{the total}} of Medals of Honor awarded to Hispanics for their actions in World War II. On April 28, 1951, President Barack Obama {{announced}} that on March 18, 2014, 4 Hispanics who served in World War II will have their Distinguished Service Cross Medal's upgraded to the Medal of Honor in a ceremony in the White House. They are: Pvt. Pedro Cano, Pvt. Joe Gandara, Pfc. Salvador J. Lara and Staff Sgt. Manuel V. Mendoza. The award <b>comes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Defense Authorization Act which called {{for a review of}} Jewish American and Hispanic American veterans from World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War to ensure that no prejudice was shown to those deserving the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|Several years later, {{according}} to a narration collected by historian Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad was involved with a well-known story about setting the Black Stone {{in place in the}} wall of the Kaaba in 605 CE. The Black Stone, a sacred object, was removed during renovations to the Kaaba. The Meccan leaders could not agree which clan should return the Black Stone to its place. They decided to ask the next man who <b>comes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gate to make that decision; that man was the 35-year-old Muhammad. This event happened five years before the first revelation by Gabriel to him. He asked for a cloth and laid the Black Stone in its center. The clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and together carried the Black Stone to the right spot, then Muhammad laid the stone, satisfying the honour of all.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} Adam and Rachel having sex {{in a shop}} window in the third episode, {{inspired}} by one of Bullen's ex-girlfriends, was filmed in an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station. The unit was dressed {{to look like a}} charity shop, with various items and the bed added. Mylod and the stunt co-ordinator storyboarded the sequence where the car <b>comes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> shop window before setting it up on location. Nesbitt and Baxendale were switched with stunt doubles and the car was propelled up a ramp through the window. Explosive charges were placed on the glass to achieve a shatter effect. As only one take could be done, Mylod trailed five cameras on the window. Filming ran from 8p.m. to 6a.m. the following day. The location was near several clubs and many passers-by inquired what was being filmed. To avoid giving away the plot they were told that Baxendale was filming a bed advertisement, capitalising on her exposure from appearing in Friends. Baxendale selected the lingerie Rachel wears in that episode herself, buying £2,000 worth from the Janet Reger outlet in Knightsbridge, London.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} method of {{monetary}} and resource sponsorship teams <b>comes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> community surrounding the team. Since {{the majority of}} teams are based around a school or a school district, schools often provide the infrastructure needed to run a team. Local governments and individual citizens may provide funds and other support to teams. Local universities and colleges often give significant funds to teams.|$|E

25|$|Wellington is {{marketed as}} the 'coolest little {{capital in the}} world' by Positively Wellington Tourism, an award-winning {{regional}} tourism organisation set up as a council controlled organisation by Wellington City Council in 1997.

The long-term domestic marketing strategy was a finalist in the 2011 CAANZ Media Awards.|$|E
25|$|Henry {{comes home}} briefly. He tells {{his wife that}} he has been {{entrusted}} with holding a secret pre-conference meeting at his home with a foreign diplomat who is arriving that night and he leaves to meet them. The room is empty for a moment and Costello re-enters through the French windows. Like Jeremy before, he starts to go through the contents of the desk with the secret drawer. Behind him, the door of the hidden recess opens and an unseen hand clubs him down. He falls to the ground behind a sofa. After Clarissa shows her husband off, she re-enters the room and soon finds the body of Costello. Almost instantly Pippa <b>comes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hidden recess and starts babbling hysterically that she is responsible. Clarissa tries to calm her down while wondering what she will do...|$|E
25|$|Typically a TEM {{consists}} of three stages of lensing. The stages are the condenser lenses, the objective lenses, and the projector lenses. The condenser lenses are responsible for primary beam formation, while the objective lenses focus the beam that <b>comes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sample itself (in STEM scanning mode, there are also objective lenses above the sample to make the incident electron beam convergent). The projector lenses are used to expand the beam onto the phosphor screen or other imaging device, such as film. The magnification of the TEM {{is due to the}} ratio of the distances between the specimen and the objective lens' image plane. Additional stigmators allow for the correction of asymmetrical beam distortions, known as astigmatism. It is noted that TEM optical configurations differ significantly with implementation, with manufacturers using custom lens configurations, such as in spherical aberration corrected instruments, or TEMs using energy filtering to correct electron chromatic aberration.|$|E

500|$|The fourth {{generation}} MacBook Pro follows {{the design of}} the previous two generations with an all-metal unibody enclosure and separated black keys. A few apparent design changes are a thinner chassis, thinner screen bezel, larger trackpad, the OLED Touch Bar, and shallower butterfly mechanism keyboard with less key separation than the previous models. The speakers grilles have been relocated to the sides of the keyboard on the 13-inch variant. Tear downs show that the speaker grilles on the 13-inch model with Touch Bar are [...] "largely cosmetic", and that sound output mostly <b>comes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> side vents. The {{fourth generation}} MacBook Pro comes in two finishes, the traditional silver color and a darker [...] "space gray" [...] color. The MacBook Pro model name returns {{to the bottom of the}} screen bezel in Apple's San Francisco font after being absent from the third generation. Similar to the Retina MacBook, the new models replace the backlit Apple logo on the rear of the screen with a glossy opaque version.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{imprecision}} of the fairy's curse, which was placed on [...] "the English magician," [...] Norrell is trapped along with Strange in the [...] "Eternal Night," [...] and they cannot move more than a certain distance from each other. Upon the gentleman with the thistledown hair's death, Arabella <b>comes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mirror in Padua, where Flora is waiting for her upon instruction of Strange. The penultimate scene is of Childermass releasing the contract upon The Learned Society of York Magicians, telling them they can study magic again, and showing the now restored Vinculus as proof that one last book remains, tattooed upon his body. Two months later, Strange has a conversation with Arabella, who is still living in Padua, explaining that he and Norrell are working to undo the eternal darkness they are both trapped in, but are planning to adventure into other worlds. Neither wish to take her to Faerie again, so he instead promises to return to her when he dis-spells the darkness and tells her not to be a widow till then, which she agrees to.|$|E

2500|$|Sacramento has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa), {{characterized}} by damp to wet, mild winters and hot, dry summers. The wet season is generally October through April, though {{there may be}} a day or two of light rainfall in June or September. The normal annual mean temperature is , with the monthly daily average temperature ranging from [...] in December to [...] in July.

It is so heavy, and <b>comes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> single canvas of the tents, wetting everything… All the morning the gangways are filled with the blankets and odds and ends, regularly turned out to dry in the sun.

2500|$|The 4th-century AD Lycurgus Cup in the British Museum is a {{spectacular}} cage cup which changes colour when light <b>comes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> glass; {{it shows the}} bound King Lycurgus being taunted by the god and attacked by a satyr; {{this may have been}} used for celebration of Dionysian mysteries. [...] Elizabeth Kessler has theorized that a mosaic appearing on the triclinium floor of the House of Aion in Nea Paphos, Cyprus, details a monotheistic worship of Dionysus. In the mosaic, other gods appear but may only be lesser representations of the centrally imposed Dionysus. [...] The mid-Byzantine Veroli Casket shows the tradition lingering in Constantinople around 1000 AD, but probably not very well understood.|$|E
