The investigated biomass-based CHPs are economically viable only with high overall efficiency and low power-to-heat ratio due to both low investment and operational costs. The biomass-based CCHPs do not have economic or environmental benefits over the biomass-based CHPs due to the significant increase entailed of both investment and operational costs.

40|$|All new {{buildings}} will be nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEB) in Europe {{by the end}} of 2020, in compliance with the recast Directive on the Building Energy Performance (EPBD recast 2010 / 31 /EU). Thereby changes to the energy performance requirements for buildings are also expected to come through the application of costoptimality concept. The European Parliament and the Council have hence established that Member States (MS) have to create a set of reference buildings to which apply energy efficiency measures and to calculate the cost optimal levels of minimum energy performance. In particular the cost optimal level is defined as the energy performance level which leads to the lowest cost during the estimated economic lifecycle. It must be calculated in accordance with a <b>comparative</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>framework</b> that is based on the global cost method. This one considers, for each energy efficiency measure, the initial investment, the sum of the annual costs for every year (including energy costs) and the final value, all with reference to the starting year of the calculation period. The analysis carried on within this research, apply the <b>comparative</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>framework</b> to two European case studies in order to compare the obtainable results and point out the criticalities of this procedure. In particular two reference existing buildings, now mainly used for office purpose, were selected as the EPBD recast requires applying the cost-optimal procedures by using typical buildings; one of them is representative of the Italian existing buildings stock and the other one of the Turkish one. Although Turkey is not yet a European Member State, but just a candidate, the cost optimal methodology has been applied to a Turkish case study as this methodology represents a current and widespread area of research also in this country. A set of energy efficiency measures has been selected, organized into packages and applied to retrofit the reference buildings. They mostly consist of the improvement of the envelope thermal insulation and of the systems efficiency; the measures have been defined in compliance with the respective national regulations in terms of energy. The on-site production of renewable energy, from PV system on the building roof (when suitable according to the law), has been considered as an additional efficiency measure. The office buildings energy performance and the impact of the efficiency measures have been assessed by means of dynamic simulation with the EnergyPlus code. In order to establish which of the packages defined has the lowest global cost and represents thus the cost optimal level, the global cost method has been applied to the two reference buildings according to the European Standard EN 15459 : 2007.

The minimum energy performance requirements are represented by the area of the cost curve that delivers the lowest cost for the end-user and society. The results demonstrate that the minimum requirements set for new single family houses in national building codes in force are more severe than the minimum requirements corresponding to the cost optimal level, mainly due to the national energy and climate policy targets in the building sector.

40|$|Energy Efficiency in Buildings {{has been}} gaining {{increasing}} relevance in the past decades due to the raise of the energy consumption in the building sector {{as a consequence of}} the modern way of living with higher comfort patterns. In Europe, buildings are responsible for 40 % of the energy consumption, which turns them into an important target for carbon emissions’ reduction [1]. Energy efficiency should be a main concern not only in new buildings, but also in the existing ones, which have poor energy performances. In Portugal most of the building stock was built before 1990, date of entrance into force of the first thermal regulation. Therefore, most of these buildings need intervention to improve not only the living environment, but also their energy performances. To evaluate the best measures, that fulfil the minimum requirements established for the energy needs with the lowest costs, the European Commission released the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) Nº 244 / 2012 that establishes a <b>comparative</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>framework</b> for calculating the cost-optimal level for minimum energy performance.

In Italy the cost optimal methodology has been performed by using a simulation tool enforced on a quasi-steady state numerical model (UNI/TS 11300) while the cost optimisation procedure is based on a sequential search-optimisation technique considering discrete options, as introduced in a previous work.

40|$|The European energy {{policies}} {{about climate}} and energy package, {{known as the}} “ 20 - 20 - 20 ” targets define ambitious, but achievable, national energy objectives. As regards the Directives {{closely related to the}} 2020 targets, the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD Recast- DIR 2010 / 31 /EU) is the main European legislative instrument for improving the energy performance of buildings, taking into account outdoor climatic and local conditions, as well as indoor climate requirements and cost-effectiveness. The EPBD recast now requests that Member States shall ensure that minimum energy performance requirements for buildings are set “with a view to achieving cost-optimal levels”. The cost optimum level shall be calculated in accordance with a <b>comparative</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>framework,</b> leaving the Member States to determine which of these calculations is to become the national benchmark against which national minimum energy performance requirements will be assessed. The European standards (ENs- Umbrella Document V 7 (prCEN/TR 15615) are intended to support the EPBD by providing the calculation methods and associated material to obtain the overall energy performance of a building. For Italy the Energy Performance of Building Simulations EPBS must be calculated with standard UNITS 11300. The energy building behaviour is referred to standard and not to real use, nor climate or dynamic energy evaluation.

40|$|The {{building}} sector represents around 32 % {{of total}} {{final energy demand}} and 40 % of primary energy consumption at European level and is thus very energy-intensive. In this context, the Directive 2010 / 31 /EU "Energy Performance of Buildings" (EPBD recast) establishes a <b>comparative</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>framework</b> {{for the assessment of}} buildings' energy performance "with a view to achieving cost-optimal levels". The cost optimal analysis leads to a package of energy efficiency measures that minimizes the global cost over a building's lifecycle. Since {{it is not possible to}} apply such analysis to each building, a set of reference buildings (RBs) must be defined to represent the national building stock, as previously done but with different targets. It is important to highlight that hospitals are the most energy-intensive type of building, since they require big amounts of energy for air-conditioning in order to maintain an high air quality level also for the working of equipments and diagnostic tools. To reduce hospitals' energy consumptions while satisfying quality standards, new tools are required. Therefore, referring to the legislative framework in force, this PhD thesis illustrates an original methodology to define a hospital reference building (both for new or existing hospitals) and to evaluate, using a multi-objective approach, the optimal energy performance levels related to different refurbishment scenarios. Referring to a fixed location (Naples, 1034 DD), an original methodology to characterize a hospital reference building is illustrated; in more detail two versions of the reference building were characterized, the first one representative of hospitals built between 1991 and 2005 and the second one representative of new buildings. The core of this methodology is the development of a virtual building based on statistical data and, exceptionally, on experts' knowledge and other sources of information. The methodology is organized in different phases: definition of the geometry, subdivision into thermal zones, definition of the architectural envelope, development of the geometric model, systems' characterization, dynamic energy simulation. The analysis of energy performance, using Energy plus, was carried out for both RBs and the primary energy consumptions for all uses are characterized. Referring to different retrofit's scenario an analysis of elements and technologies for the reduction of the energy demand was carried out, with an approach first focused on the detailed study of the single design element and then on the global analysis of the efficacy of "energy efficiency packages" (EEMs). In order to evaluate the optimal EEMs a new methodology was developed for cost-optimal analysis by means of the multi-objective optimization of hospitals energy performance. Finally a dynamic energy analysis of a real hospital case study, representative of the existing stock, was reported in order to compare with the Reference Building' energy performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of buildings and their operation contribute to {{a large proportion of}} total energy end-use worldwide; indeed, buildings account for 40 % of the total energy consumption and for 36 % of CO 2 emissions in the European Union. The sector is expanding, which is bound to increase its energy consumption. In order to reduce the growing energy expenditure, the European Directive imposes the adoption of measures to improve the energy efficiency in buildings. The recast of the Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings defined all new buildings will be nearly zero-energy buildings by the end of 2020. However, the transformation of the EU's building stock will not be completed until well after 2020 and this target can only constitute an intermediate step. Indeed, the recent Commission Roadmap for moving towards a competitive, low-carbon economy showed that emissions in the building sector could be reduced by around 90 % by 2050. While new buildings should be designed as intelligent low or zero-energy buildings, refurbishment of existing building stock has many challenges and opportunities because, in the building sector, most energy is consumed by existing buildings. Since the replacement rate of existing buildings by the new-build is only around 1 - 3 % per annum, a rapid enhancement of taking up retrofit measures on a large scale is essential for a timely reduction in global energy use and promotion of environmental sustainability. Consequently, defining minimum energy performance requirements for new and, in particular, for existing buildings represent a key element in European building codes. For this reason, EPBD recast has set out Member States must ensure that minimum energy performance requirements are set with a view to achieve cost-optimal levels for buildings, building units and buildings elements. A cost-optimal level is defined as the energy performance level which leads to the lowest cost during the estimated economic lifecycle. It must be calculated in accordance with a <b>comparative</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>framework</b> that is based on the global cost method. To apply this methodology Member States are expected to define a series of Reference Buildings as baseline and representative models of the national building stock. Additionally, they must define energy efficiency measures to be applied to Reference Building; these ones can be a single measure or constitute a package of measures. Reference Buildings can be exploited as a basis for analysing national building stock and the potential impacts of energy efficiency measures in order to select effective strategies for upgrading existing buildings. Finally, once estimated the Reference Building energy consumptions and the impact of the different energy efficiency measures, the costs of the different packages are estimated in order to establish which of them has the lowest global cost and, consequently, represents the cost-optimal level. Global cost method considers the initial investment, the sum of the annual costs for every year and the final value, all with reference to the starting year of the calculation period. A measure or package of measures is cost-effective when the cost of implementation is lower than the value of the benefits that result, taken over the expected life of the measure. The cost-optimal result represents that retrofit action or combination of actions that minimized the global cost. From the variety of specific results, a cost curve can be derived; the lowest part of this curve represents the economic optimum for the specific set of the analyzed energy efficiency measures. This PhD study deals with complex scenario above described. Its main objective is to examine cost-optimal analysis in order to establish if this methodology can be an appropriate tool to guide and support decisions related with buildings energy performances. In detail, a critical review of the methodology has been developed and some sensitivity analyses have been exploited in order to testing the robustness of the cost-optimal analysis results. Considering the influence that similar outcomes could have on the European energy policies and on the roadmap towards 2050, it is fundamental to evaluate, even before the same outcomes, how these are reliable. Cost-optimality as a theoretical concept is well and clearly established. However, its application is far from easy and straightforward. Indeed, cost-optimal analysis is a complex methodology characterized by an inherent degree of uncertainty in the final outputs; choices of methodology, procedural decision and complexity of much of the input data significantly affect outcomes. In addition, the research highlights that often although a cost-optimal calculation is being developed and some energy efficiency retrofit measures are individualized, there are no effective instruments, in term of energy policies and financial tools, to drive the market to increase the rate of deep renovation...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that the building sector largely contributes to the total European energy consumption with a 40 % influence on the total assessed energy uses. To this regard the EPBD recast Directive promotes nearly zero energy buildings (nZEB) for {{the public and the}} private sector as a mandatory requirement by 2020. Given the low energy efficiency of old buildings, concerns {{about the state of the}} existing building stock should be seriously considered as most of the energy consumption is attributable to the existing buildings. Additionally, residential buildings are often seen as long-term assets, setting thus a low replacement rate, approximately 1 % per year in Europe, of old buildings by new ones. To this regard, larger energy savings can be achieved with the energy retrofitting of the existing building stock, rather than with the construction of relatively small proportion of new high performing buildings. Therefore, the refurbishment of the existing building stock has to be primarily planned and accomplished in order to achieve a timely reduction on the buildings energy consumption. Concerning this, the EPBD recast, as policy driver for reducing European energy use in buildings, has been representing the first and main legislative reference. According to it Member States must ensure that minimum energy performance requirements are set with a view of achieving at least cost-optimal levels for buildings, building units and building elements" by means of a <b>comparative</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>framework</b> applied to new constructions and existing buildings undergoing major renovations. The methodology specifies how to compare energy efficiency measures in relation to their energy performance and to the cost attributed to their implementation, and how to apply these to selected reference buildings with the aim of identifying cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements. A cost optimal level is defined as the energy performance level, which leads to the lowest cost during the estimated economic lifecycle of the building. A measure is considered cost-effective when the cost of implementation is lower than the achievable benefits, during the expected life of the measure. This type of analysis allows defining energy renovation scenario based on their energy and economic optimum. Within the complex scenario described above, this Ph. D. thesis aims to provide a scalable methodology for the definition of energy retrofit scenarios to be applied to existing buildings, based on the use of dynamic building simulation models. The methodology targets the existing building stock given the large energy savings that can be achieved from existing buildings. It builds on an energy and economic assessment of energy efficiency measures applied to different building typologies. The energy and economic assessment are respectively carried out by means of dynamic building simulation and a cost-optimality approach. The cost optimal analysis was chosen for the aim of this study for its systematic approach in defining energy retrofit interventions based on their energy and economic optimum. The term "scalable" is used for defining the methodology as the studied energy retrofit scenarios can vary depending on the "scale" of the study. Two main scales of buildings can be distinguished: building stock or single buildings. When retrofit interventions are studied to be applied to wide portion of the building stock, as for example at national level, representative building models are used. They correspond to reference buildings representative of a certain building typology, construction age and geographic location. Within this thesis, a methodology for their definition was defined and various reference buildings for the Italian context were created. On the contrary, when it is necessary to study specific and customized retrofit measures, a single existing building is modelled. In this case, compared to the case of the reference buildings, larger quantity of data and a higher degree of detail are necessary. These building models are customized based on the existing buildings characterization (e. g. building envelope, system, etc) and when applicable, based also on data from monitoring. To this regards, when detailed information about the building real operation from monitoring is available, the building model need to be calibrated based on measured data. For a model to be calibrated, the building energy consumption predicted by the simulation program, has to match the consumption measured from monitoring. Calibrated models can be used for comparing the baseline situation of the building (calibrated and not retrofitted) with other simulation results relative to the application of building renovation interventions. To this regard, within this Ph. D. thesis, a literature review on the most common calibration techniques currently in use for the calibration of building models was conducted. Additionally two case studies were calibrated by means of two different approaches: a trial and error approach and an optimization-based calibration. For both scale of buildings (building stock and single buildings), dynamic building simulation was employed for the energy assessment. Building simulation application has expanded since mid-‘ 70 s building simulation as an attempt to emulate reality. To date, it is much more common to employ building simulation in post construction or advanced building design phases rather than in early phases. In particular building simulation is frequently used for the prediction of energy savings by assessing energy retrofit interventions on existing buildings. To this regard, given its wide application and the high level of detail of the analysis performed (dynamic analysis), building simulation was chosen within this thesis, as a tool for the energy assessment of buildings and of the relative energy renovation interventions. Finally, the economic assessment of the energy retrofit measures was carried out by means of the cost optimal methodology, as defined by the EPBD recast. The methodology allowed defining energy renovation interventions based on their economical and energy optimum. The Directive requires to define different packages of energy efficiency measures, which can be applied to reference representative buildings but also to single and existing building for energy and economical assessments. The energy assessment of a building can be carried out with analytical or simplified methods, but dynamic building simulation is strongly suggested, as performed within this thesis. For the economic assessment, the global cost method was employed based on the calculation method of the Standard EN 15459 as advised by the EBPD. The global cost method considers, for each energy efficiency measure, the initial investment, the sum of the annual costs for every year (including energy costs) and the final value, all with reference to the starting year of the calculation period. In order to define different energy retrofit solution and set the minimum energy performance requirements, within the Ph. D. thesis, the cost optimal approach was applied to both the considered scale of buildings: to the building stock scale with three reference buildings, and to the single buildings scale with two calibrated buildings. A set of energy efficiency measures was defined and applied to the case studies for evaluating the financial and energy performance gap between the cost-optimal solutions and nZEB levels, respectively. For the building stock, different energy retrofit solutions are defined as final outcomes. Given the use of representative models (reference buildings), the retrofit solutions can be replicated to several buildings, among the same building typology. In this sense, different energy retrofit solutions can be established. On the other hand, for single buildings, the energy retrofit solution studied is specific and customized barely to the analyzed case stud...|$|E
