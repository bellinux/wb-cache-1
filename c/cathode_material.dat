500|$|In 1896, the British {{physicist}} J. J. Thomson, {{with his}} colleagues John S. Townsend and H. A. Wilson, performed experiments indicating that cathode rays really were unique particles, rather than waves, atoms or molecules as was believed earlier. Thomson made good estimates {{of both the}} charge e and the mass m, finding that cathode ray particles, which he called [...] "corpuscles," [...] had perhaps one thousandth {{of the mass of}} the least massive ion known: hydrogen. He showed that their charge-to-mass ratio, e/m, was independent of <b>cathode</b> <b>material.</b> He further showed that the negatively charged particles produced by radioactive materials, by heated materials and by illuminated materials were universal. The name electron was again proposed for these particles by the Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney, and the name has since gained universal acceptance.|$|E

40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{progresses}} {{has been made in}} the pursuit of high energy and high power battery devices in the past decades on account of the growing demand for clean and sustainable energy. The tremendous challenges in increasing the specific energy and power density of batteries lie mainly in the <b>cathode</b> <b>materials.</b> Lots of {{attempts have been made to}} improve the reversible capacity and rate capability of <b>cathode</b> <b>materials</b> for lithium ion batteries in the past few years. On the one hand, the rate capability of the <b>cathode</b> <b>materials</b> depends strongly on their surface structures, which determine the kinetics of lithium ion transportation and intercalation. Through tuning the surface structure of <b>cathode</b> <b>materials,</b> the density of channels for fast Li+ diffusion can be increased, and therefore enhance greatly the surface/interfacial transportation kinetics of lithium ions. On the other hand, the reversible capacity of the <b>cathode</b> <b>materials</b> of lithium ion batteries is in direct proportion to the number of electrons transferred, thus exploration of high capacity <b>cathode</b> <b>materials</b> beyond intercalation, such as sulfur cathodes, has been conducted extensively. The utilization efficiency of sulfur active materials, the reaction kinetics and trapping of soluble polysulfides depend also on the structure of sulfur cathodes. This review outlines recent developments in structure-tuning of the most appealing <b>cathode</b> <b>materials,</b> including layered lithium metal oxides, olivine structured LiFePO 4, spinel LiMn 2 O 4 and LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4, as well as sulfur cathodes.

2500|$|In 1866, Georges Leclanché {{patented}} a new battery system, {{which was}} immediately successful. Leclanché's original cell was assembled in a porous pot. The positive electrode (the cathode) consisted of crushed manganese dioxide {{with a little}} carbon mixed in. The negative pole (anode) was a zinc rod. The cathode was packed into the pot, and a carbon rod was inserted {{to act as a}} current collector. The anode and the pot were then immersed in an ammonium chloride solution.

2500|$|The {{promise of}} {{titanium}} disulfide as a <b>cathode</b> <b>material</b> in rechargeable batteries {{was described in}} 1973 by M. Stanley Whittingham. The Group IV and V dichalcogenides attracted attention for their high electrical conductivities. The originally described battery used a lithium anode and a titanium disulfide cathode. This battery had high energy density and the diffusion of lithium ions into the titanium disulfide cathode was reversible, making the battery rechargeable. Titanium disulfide was chosen {{because it is the}} lightest and cheapest chalcogenide. Titanium disulfide also has the fastest rate of lithium ion diffusion into the crystal lattice. [...] The main problem was degradation of the cathode after multiple recycles. [...] This reversible intercalation process allows the battery to be rechargeable. Additionally, titanium disulfide is the lightest and the cheapest of all group IV and V layered dichalcogenides. In the 1990s, titanium disulfide was replaced by other cathode materials (manganese and cobalt oxides) in most rechargeable batteries.|$|E

40|$|In Lithium ion {{batteries}} (LIBs), proper {{design of}} <b>cathode</b> <b>materials</b> influences its intercalation behavior, overall cost, structural stability, {{and its impact}} on environment. At present, {{the most common type of}} <b>cathode</b> <b>materials,</b> NCA, has very high cobalt concentration. Since cobalt is toxic and expensive, the existing design of <b>cathode</b> <b>materials</b> is not cost-effective, and environmentally benign. However, these immensely important issues have not yet been properly addressed. Therefore, we have performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate three types of NCA <b>cathode</b> <b>materials</b> NCA_(Co= 0. 15), NCA_(Co= 0. 10), NCA_(Co= 0. 05). Our results show that even if the cobalt concentration is significantly decreased from NCA_(Co= 0. 15) to NCA_(Co= 0. 05), variation in intercalation potential and specific capacity is negligible. For example, in case of 50 % Li concentration, voltage drop is ~ 0. 12 V while change in specific capacity is negligible. Moreover, decrease in cobalt concentration doesn't influence the structural stability. We have also explored the influence of sodium doping on the electrochemical and structural properties of these three structures.

50|$|The basic {{element of}} the common ion pump is a Penning trap. A {{swirling}} cloud of electrons produced by an electric discharge is temporarily stored in the anode region of a Penning trap. These electrons ionize incoming gas atoms and molecules. The resultant swirling ions are accelerated to strike a chemically active cathode (usually titanium). On impact the accelerated ions will either become buried within the cathode or sputter <b>cathode</b> <b>material</b> onto {{the walls of the}} pump. The freshly sputtered chemically active <b>cathode</b> <b>material</b> acts as a getter that then evacuates the gas by both chemisorption and physisorption resulting in a net pumping action. Inert and lighter gases, such as He and H2 tend not to sputter and are absorbed by physisorption. Some fraction of the energetic gas ions (including gas that is not chemically active with the <b>cathode</b> <b>material)</b> can strike the cathode and acquire an electron from the surface, neutralizing it as it rebounds. These rebounding energetic neutrals are buried in exposed pump surfaces.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} side of the cell, the <b>cathode</b> <b>material</b> is {{composed}} of a porous Ni that is converted to a lithiated nickel oxide (lithium is intercalated within the NiO crystal structure). The pore size within the cathode is in the range of 7-15 μm with 60-70% of the material being porous. The primary issue with the <b>cathode</b> <b>material</b> is dissolution of NiO since it reacts with CO2 when the cathode is in contact with the carbonate electrolyte. This dissolution leads to precipitation of Ni metal in the electrolyte and since it is electrically conductive, the fuel cell can get short circuited. Therefore, current studies have looked into the addition of MgO to the NiO cathode to limit this dissolution. Magnesium oxide serves to reduce the solubility of Ni2+ in the cathode and decreases precipitation in the electrolyte. Alternatively, replacement of the conventional <b>cathode</b> <b>material</b> with a LiFeO2-LiCoO2-NiO alloy has shown promising performance results and almost completely avoids the problem of Ni dissolution of the cathode.|$|E
