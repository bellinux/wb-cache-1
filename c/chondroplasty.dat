40|$|The use of {{radiofrequency}} devices {{has become}} widespread for surgical ablation procedures. When ablation devices {{have been deployed}} in treatment settings requiring tissue preservation like débridement <b>chondroplasty,</b> adoption has been limited due to the collateral damage caused by these devices in healthy tissue surrounding the treatment site. Ex vivo radiofrequency mediated débridement <b>chondroplasty</b> was performed on osteochondral specimens demonstrating surface fibrillation obtained from patients undergoing knee total joint replacement. Three radiofrequency systems designed to perform débridement <b>chondroplasty</b> were tested each demonstrating different energy delivery methods: monopolar ablation, bipolar ablation, and non-ablation energy. Treatment outcomes were compared with control specimens as to clinical endpoint and histopomorphic characteristics. Fibrillated cartilage was removed in all specimens; however, the residual tissue remaining at the treatment site displayed significantly different characteristics attributable to radiofrequency energy delivery method. Systems that delivered ablation-based energies caused tissue necrosis and collateral damage at the treatment site including corruption of cartilage Superficial and Transitional Zones; whereas, the non-ablation system created a smooth articular surface with Superficial Zone maintenance and without chondrocyte death or tissue necrosis. The mechanism of radiofrequency energy deposition upon tissues is particularly important in treatment settings requiring tissue preservation.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to test the {{hypothesis}} that thermal treatment of grade III chondromalacia using radiofrequency energy (RFE) results in greater cartilage smoothing as compared to mechanical debridement and as compared to no treatment. Methods: Fresh human articular cartilage specimens were obtained from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. One-centimeter square grade ill chondromalacia lesions were identified and randomly assigned to thermal <b>chondroplasty,</b> mechanical <b>chondroplasty</b> or 2 ̆ 2 no treatment 2 ̆ 2 groups. Digital video arthroscopy images were recorded, demonstrating the lesions pre- and post-treatment. Outcomes were assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) by five orthopedic surgeons who were blinded to the treatment groups. Analysis of variance was performed to detect differences in mean smoothing scores among the three groups.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the subchondral temperature during radiofrequency energy (RFE) application simulating <b>chondroplasty</b> in an arthroscopic setting of the wrist. Methods A <b>chondroplasty</b> of the lunate fossa was performed during an arthroscopy setting on 14 cadaver arms using monopolar or biopolar RFE. The temperature was recorded simultaneously from 7 predefined anatomical landmarks. Results The mean temperature for both application modes did not exceed more than 30 °C at all measured points, except for the lunate fossa. The highest subchondral measured peak temperature was 49. 35 °C (monopolar) and 69. 21 °C (bipolar) in the lunate fossa. In addition, the temperature decreased for both radiofrequency (RF) devices depending on the distance of the sensors to the RF-probe. Conclusion It remains to be questionable how safe RFE can be used for <b>chondroplasty</b> in wrist arthroscopy under continuous irrigation and constant movement to obtain the desired sealing effect. However, the bipolar device should be applied with more caution since peak temperature in the lunate fossa almost reached 70 °C even under continuous irrigation...|$|E

The aims of this study were to investigate a wide range of biphasic hydrogels as potential <b>chondroplasty</b> materials and to further the understanding of natural joint tribology. The mechanical properties of each potential <b>chondroplasty</b> material were quantified and their tribological performance investigated by means of a series of simple geometry friction and wear studies in Ringer's solution and a proteincontaining lubricant. Also uni- and multi-directional continuous sliding tests in a protein-containing lubricant were conducted under various loading conditions to evaluate the friction and degradation of each material and that of the opposing articular cartilage surface. A number of potential <b>chondroplasty</b> materials were also evaluated as defect repair materials when implanted using a proposed clinical method. Selected biphasic hydrogel materials showed a marked reduction in dynamic friction, degradation and articular cartilage pin damage when compared with single-phase materials. Following continuous wear studies, alterations in opposing cartilage surface topography were found to be associated with increased levels of dynamic friction. The protocols devised in this study are the first to yield objective and quantifiable data demonstrating a reduction in friction and opposing cartilage surface degradation following the implantation of certain biphasic hydrogel defect repair materials. They also demonstrate the potential of biphasic hydrogels to act as superior <b>chondroplasty</b> materials compared with currently available materials.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the depth of penetration from mechanical <b>chondroplasty</b> and metabolic consequences of this procedure on the remaining articular cartilage. METHODS: Mechanical <b>chondroplasty</b> was performed in vitro on a portion of fresh grade I or II articular cartilage from 8 human knee arthroplasty specimens. Treated and control (untreated) explants (approximately 30 mg) were cut from the cartilage. The explants were divided into 2 groups, day 1 and day 4, placed separately in a 48 -well plate containing media, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. After the 24 -hour incubation, the explants were weighed on day 1 and day 4, and explant media were removed and tested for total proteoglycan synthesis and aggrecan synthesis. At time 0, 2 sets (2. 6 mm each) of treated and control cartilage slices were cut with a precision saw. One set was stained for confocal laser microscopy via a cytotoxicity stain to determine cell viability. The second set was stained with H;E to determine depth of penetration. RESULTS: The mean depth of penetration was 252. 8 +/- 78 microm. There was no significant difference (P >. 25) between total proteoglycan synthesis for control versus treatment groups on day 1 or 4. Aggrecan synthesis was significantly reduced on day 1 when normalized for tissue weight (P =. 019) and double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (P =. 004). On day 4, no significant difference was detected. Confocal laser microscopy did not show cell death below the zone of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant metabolic consequence caused by <b>chondroplasty</b> to the remaining articular cartilage, and the zone of injury was limited to the treatment area.

40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} {{has little}} ability to repair partial-thickness injuries, {{and if any}} repair response does occur, it is often dis-organized and inadequate. 28 This poor healing response may predispose the surrounding cartilage to progressive dam-age, leading to enlargement of the defect and release of intra-articular debris, which may result in mechanical or inflammatory symptoms. Traditionally, unstable partial-thickness cartilage lesions have been treated arthroscopi-cally using mechanical instrumentation such as rotary shavers. 7, 18, 20, 25 However, with these techniques, {{it is difficult to}} smooth the articular surface, and viable cartilage may be inadvertently removed along with the unstable tissue. 16, 21 In the past few years, the use of radiofrequency (RF) -generating energy devices in arthroscopic surgery has gained popu-larity for applications such as <b>chondroplasty.</b> 4, 10, 11, 19 Radiofrequency-based devices can remove damaged tissue and produce a smooth articular surface.

40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between temperature elevation and thermal exposure time during thermal <b>chondroplasty</b> {{has implications for}} cell viability and subsequent articular cartilage function. Purpose: To characterize cartilage metabolic changes after exposure to thermal stress and to determine whether changes seen acutely are reversible. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Human cartilage was exposed to a 45 °, 50 °, or 55 °C bath for up to 3 minutes. Untreated control specimens were analyzed with each group. Viability and metabolic capability of treated and untreated specimens were evaluated immediately or 1 week after thermal stress by using methylthiotetrazole conversion, 3 H-serine incorporation into protein, and 35 S-sulfate incorporation into newly synthesized proteoglycan. Results: Nonarthritic and arthritic articular cartilage metabolic activity declined with increasing thermal exposure. Articular cartilage displayed a recovery from thermal stress after exposure to the 50 °C but not the 55 °C bath. Arthritic cartilage displayed increased sensitivity with higher temperatures.

ABR animals formed repair cartilage at the abrasion site (ABR and CT/ABR) at six months as determined by arthroscopy and at necropsy. CT and CT/ABR animals had an additional cartilage ulcer on the superior aspect of the medial condyle. The abraded site extended in CT/ABR condyles. Repair cartilage (ABR and CT/ABR) contained reduced amounts of proteoglycan as seen by histological loss of safranin O staining and reduced uronic acid content. Fibrocartilage was suggested by histological appearance, hypocellularity, and a higher hydroxyproline content. In contrast with ABR animals, the repair cartilage in the CT/ABR animals contained near normal amounts of hydroxyproline.
