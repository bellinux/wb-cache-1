5|$|After the High Councillor's {{downfall}} and the regime's {{defeat in}} Metropolis, the Regime is dismantled {{and all of}} its accomplices are arrested. Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern hands over his <b>counterpart</b> and Sinestro to the Guardians of the Universe to stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her <b>counterpart.</b> The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime <b>counterpart</b> admits that if he were placed in the same position, he might have done the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never has to learn what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever happens to him, causing him to go down the path of his <b>counterpart,</b> he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E

Assuming identical technical capabilities, the tentative mid- 2017 three-detector network observing run favors southern OIR observatories for the discovery of electromagnetic <b>counterparts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Keywords: We {{investigate}} the photometric redshift distribution, colours and morphologies {{of a large}} sample of submillimetre sources in the GOODS-North region. With the depth achieved by the deep ACS images, optical <b>counterparts</b> have been found for all the radio-detected sub-mm sources, and we have used several techniques to identify <b>counterparts</b> to the radio-undetected sources. The sub-mm <b>counterparts</b> have a median photometric redshift, from optical and near-IR photometry, of 1. 9. Our sample contains a much higher fraction of EROs than other sub-mm surveys, and larger angular sizes than the average galaxy at all redshifts. The sub-mm galaxy <b>counterparts</b> are consistent with massive star-forming galaxies at high redshift. 1...|$|R

40|$|This BA thesis {{examines}} the English translation <b>counterparts</b> of the Czech particles copak and jestlipak. The postfix -pak {{evolved from the}} eclitic particle pak, which is added to pronouns, adverbs or particles. The postfix is by its nature expressive and has an intensifying function. The present thesis analyses the particles with -pak {{from the perspective of}} the third syntactical plan (Poldauf, 1964). Based on Poldauf's findings about the English equivalents of the Czech third syntactical plan elements, the thesis presents possible English <b>counterparts</b> of the two particles. Subsequently, English <b>counterparts</b> of Czech sentences with copak/jestlipak excerpted from the parallel corpus InterCorp are analysed to find out what types of equivalents occur in English translations of Czech fiction. The English <b>counterparts</b> then serve as markers of the functions of the Czech sentences containing copak and jestlipak. Apart from emotionally evaluative functions, such as reproach, the particles are shown to have deliberative, intensifying or focusing functions. keywords: translation <b>counterparts,</b> the third syntactical plan, particle...|$|R
