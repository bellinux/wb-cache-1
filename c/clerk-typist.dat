You don’t realize how much I appreciated being remembered by the faculty and students of Bryant. As you know, the reserves reported at Fort Devens March 27 th. From there quite a few were shipped to Camp Lee, Virginia, including myself, where a five week basic training course was given. We were fortunate indeed in being together. But, alas! As soon as basic was over they shipped William Bander, George Barsalou, George Dion, and yours truly to the Mississippi Ordnance Plant while some remained at Camp Lee and others were shipped to Alanta [sic], Georgia. Because of the typing course given at Bryant, I was classified as <b>clerk-typist.</b> Am now working at Battalion Headquarters as clerk of the Headquarters and Service Company. It’s entirely different from the work one would find in the ordinary business world. May I express my admiration for the splendid work you are doing in keeping close contact with the alumnae and remembering always to add to their pleasures with little gestures. I’m sure you have the appreciation of all of us. Sincerely, Jimmy Dunn [Transcription ends...|$|E
