40|$|Hybrid {{vehicles}} {{usually have}} several braking systems, and braking mode switches are significant events during braking. It {{is difficult to}} coordinate torque fluctuations caused by mode switches because the dynamic <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> are different. In this study, {{a new type of}} plug-in hybrid vehicle is taken as the research object, and braking mode switches are divided into two types. The control strategy of type one is achieved by controlling the change rates of clutch hold-down and motor braking forces. The control strategy of type two is achieved by simultaneously changing the target braking torque during different mode switch stages and controlling the motor to participate in active coordination control. Finally, the torque coordination control strategy is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink, and the results show that the proposed control strategy has a good effect in reducing the braking torque fluctuation and vehicle shocks during braking mode switches...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} a joined {{research}} project of Knorr-Bremse, Siemens Mobility and the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the hysteresis <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> a pneumatic <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> for multi-axle heavy vehicles (MHVs). Hysteresis affects emergency braking performance severely. The fact that MHVs have a large size and complex structure leads to more nonlinear coupling property <b>of</b> the pneumatic <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> compared to normal two-axle vehicles. Thus, theoretical analysis and simulation are not enough when studying hysteresis. In this article, the hysteresis <b>of</b> a pneumatic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> for an eight-axle vehicle in an emergency braking situation is studied based on a novel test bench. A servo drive device is applied to simulate the driver’s braking intensions normally expressed by opening or moving speed <b>of</b> the <b>brake</b> pedal. With a reasonable arrangement of sensors and the NI LabVIEW platform, both the delay time of eight loops and the response time of each subassembly in a single loop are detected in real time. The outcomes of the experiment show that the delay time of each loop gets longer {{with the increase of}} pedal opening, and a quadratic relationship exists between them. Based on this, the pressure transient in the system is fitted to a first-order plus time delay model. Besides, the response time of treadle valve and controlling pipeline accounts for more than 80 % of the loop’s total delay time, indicating that these two subassemblies are the main contributors to the hysteresis effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to {{investigate}} the dynamic centre of pressure during a noisy brake application. A novel technique is employed to measure the centre of pressure and contact pressure distribution between the disc/pad interfaces during braking events. The test rig was developed to study the contact pressure distribution between disc/pad interfaces. The caliper and set of pads were modified to measure both static and dynamic centre <b>of</b> pressure during <b>braking</b> events. The brake uses a 12 piston opposed caliper arranged to allow {{a number of the}} pistons to be controlled independently using 4 master cylinders. This allows the interface centre of pressure to be adjusted both {{along the length of the}} pad and radially. The tests included static pressure measurements with the sensor film between the pad friction face and the disc, the centre of pressure being adjusted using the master cylinders to provide a “system benchmark”. Once the static <b>characteristic</b> behaviour <b>of</b> the modified pad is established, the centre of pressure variation is measured under dynamic conditions. This allows the movement of the centre of pressure to be plotted against brake pressure and rotor speed. Furthermore, a detailed finite element model <b>of</b> a disc <b>brake</b> assembly is developed. Contact analysis was performed to determine the pressure distribution, interfacial contact area and normal contact forces under both frictionless (μ= 0) and frictional braking conditions. The effect of varying friction coefficients and the brake hydraulic pressure is also examined. Preliminary finite element results of contact pressure distribution between the disc/pad interfaces were compared with the experimental results, followed by a detailed modal analysis <b>of</b> disc <b>brake</b> to predict the natural frequencies and the mode shapes <b>of</b> disc <b>brake.</b> In addition, a stability analysis <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> assembly is carried out to distinguish the unstable frequencies. Structure modification <b>of</b> disc <b>brake</b> assembly was also investigated to understand the <b>characteristics</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> in terms <b>of</b> squeal noise performance. It is established from the results that there is a strong relationship between the interface pressure distribution, the effective centre of pressure and the propensity <b>of</b> the <b>brake</b> to generate noise. It is noticed that the centre of pressure may vary both along the pad and radially during braking which adds to the complex analysis of instability. The finite element results compared well with the experimental results. It is observed that the contact pressure distribution and the magnitude of normal contact forces are much higher towards the leading edge of the pads comparing to the trailing edge. It is also established yet again that with a leading centre <b>of</b> pressure the <b>brake</b> is more prone to noise whereas with a trailing centre of pressure the system is more likely to be stable...|$|R

40|$|Heavy haul {{trains are}} used to {{transport}} mineral resources from inland mines to harbours in South Africa. It is believed that the cost is less with a larger load per car or per train. This {{has resulted in the}} use of long heavy haul trains. The increase in train length has posed unprecedented technical challenges. For heavy haul trains, energy consumption, running time and in-train forces between neighbouring cars are of much concern to transportation corporations. The objective of the study is to find optimal driving methodologies for the implementation of a desired speed profile with energy consumption and in-train forces considered. Firstly, three control strategies are proposed in this study for train handling. In view <b>of</b> the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> traditional pneumatic <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> and the new Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) <b>braking</b> <b>systems,</b> a simulation study of optimal open loop controllers was undertaken. The result shows that the ECP <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> demonstrate superb performance compared with pneumatic <b>braking</b> <b>systems,</b> especially together with independent distributed power (iDP) control. Thus, the main focus of the study was the control of heavy haul trains equipped with ECP <b>braking</b> <b>systems.</b> It is shown that there are redundancies in designing an open loop controller. An optimization procedure is applied to schedule cruise control by taking the in-train forces into initial design consideration. Optimal open loop scheduling presents a better starting point for a closed-loop controller design. A type of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller with state feedback is simulated to verify the above result. However, the closed-loop control law is designed based on full state feedback, which is not practical since not all the states can be measured. An observer could be designed to supplement the LQR controller if partial states are measured. This is, however, not the approach taken in this study. Instead, the application of output regulation of nonlinear systems with measured output feedback to the control of heavy haul trains is considered. This approach to design is practically feasible and manageable, and by its nature, is also easily integrable with human drivers. In this study, the existing result of output regulation of nonlinear systems is extended. The output regulation problem of nonlinear systems with measured output feedback is formulated in this study and solved for the local version and global version. For its application to train control, some application issues are discussed. Based on the proposed theory, a speed regulator for train control is designed. Simulation results show its applicability. Lastly, this study concentrates on the fault-tolerant capacity of the speed regulator. Two kinds of fault modes are considered. Fault detection and isolation for the sensor fault and <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> fault are exploited. Controller redesign is also given. Simulation results show that such a speed regulator has a fault-tolerant capacity to the corresponding faults. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|The {{automotive}} <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> plays {{a significant}} role not only in the deceleration and stopping process, but also in many stability control strategies. To overcome the limitations <b>of</b> conventional <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> and to improve vehicle control strategies such as traction control, and differential braking, a new generation <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> called the brake-by-wire system has been introduced to the vehicle industry. This generation <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> combines electrical, mechanical and, in some cases, hydraulic components. Although different types of brake-by-wire mechanisms have been developed in the past two decades, there still exist demands for further improvement and developing new brake mechanisms in the automotive industry due to the ever increasing demand for better safety and performance. This research proposes a novel brake-by-wire system based on cam actuation. This system is a combination of electrical, mechanical and hydraulic components. The unique feature of the cam actuation <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> proposed in this research is that the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> the motor torque amplification can be optimized by careful design of the cam shape. The compactness and self-contained <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> the design allow the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> to be installed on each wheel enabling fully independent control of each wheel for better stability control. Moreover, the cam actuated brake has a fail-safe advantage by keeping the direct connection between the driver and the brake calipers in case of any system failure. In this work, different subsystems <b>of</b> the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> and their components are explained, the dynamic model of the system is found and the design parameters are optimized. Specifically, the optimal design problem has been formulated by taking the geometry of the cam as the optimization variable and the open-loop response time <b>of</b> the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> as the objective function to be minimized.
