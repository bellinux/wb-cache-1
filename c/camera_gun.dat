2500|$|At {{the time}} of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Army Air Corps still did not have a {{specialized}} school for flexible gunnery. Three schools opened in December 1941, and the program grew rapidly. [...] In July 1943 flexible gunnery schools had possessed few tactical aircraft with which to train, mainly 55 twin-engine B-34 Lexingtons (Lockheed Venturas). By December 1944 they had 440 four-engine aircraft (173 B-17 Flying Fortresses, 255 B-24 Liberators, and 12 YB-40 Flying Fortresses). By the latter date, students on gunnery missions fired from these, while two-engine aircraft towed targets and single engine tactical aircraft simulated attacks on the bombers. Unfortunately, towed targets hardly resembled attacking fighter aircraft, but one device that more closely simulated combat conditions was a <b>camera</b> <b>gun</b> that students [...] "fired" [...] at fighter aircraft flying in normal attack patterns toward the bombers. These cameras, which came into general use during 1944 and 1945.|$|E
5000|$|For {{mid-range}} weapons, {{the briefcase}} gun was tested against the <b>camera</b> <b>gun.</b> The briefcase gun killed a target with a lethal {{shot to the}} liver while the <b>camera</b> <b>gun</b> achieved an instant kill by driving a [...]22 bullet through the left nostril of a gel head. The edge {{was given to the}} briefcase gun since it contained a 9mm PPK which was a heavier caliber and longer range weapon that could be fired multiple times.|$|E

50|$|The use of gun cameras {{first became}} common for gunnery {{training}} in the 1920s though examples were used during World War I by the British Royal Flying Corps. A special version of the standard Lewis Machine Gun was manufactured as a <b>Camera</b> <b>Gun.</b> During World War II, as the Luftwaffe did with the German Robot II <b>camera,</b> <b>gun</b> cameras were commonly used on operational aircraft to record kills of enemy aircraft.

5000|$|Other {{training}} devices {{used in this}} {{instruction was}} the manipulation trainer, which consisted of 12 towers arranged to resemble a formation of planes. The towers ranged in height from 10 to 40 feet, each equipped with 2 nose, 2 tail, 2 ring sighting, and 4 blister positions. As students in these positions faced simulated attacks from PT-13 and PT-17 aircraft, they [...] "fired" [...] <b>camera</b> <b>guns</b> at the attacking fighters.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>camera</b> <b>gun</b> {{version was}} made for training. The body was of cast metal. The grip and trigger {{mechanism}} were realistic.

50|$|Bomb damage {{assessment}} (BDA), {{also known as}} battle {{damage assessment}}, is the practice of assessing damage inflicted on a target from a stand-off weapon, most typically a bomb or air launched missile. It {{is part of the}} larger discipline of combat assessment. Assessment is performed using many techniques including footage from in-weapon <b>cameras,</b> <b>gun</b> <b>cameras,</b> forces on the ground near the target, satellite imagery and follow-up visits to the target. Preventing information on battle damage reaching the enemy is a key objective of military censorship. For nuclear weapons special techniques may be required due to the extensive damage caused and difficulty in approaching the site.|$|R
5000|$|Harlingen AAF had a Waller Gunnery Trainer for {{firing at}} [...] "planes {{projected}} on a screen", and B-29 Flexible Gunnery Training at Buckingham, Harlingen, and Las Vegas included the [...] "manipulation trainer". The manipulation trainer used 12 towers at heights of 10 - 40 ft and arranged like a B-29 formation. Each tower had 2 nose, 2 tail, 2 ring sighting, and 4 blister positions {{for students to}} fire <b>camera</b> <b>guns</b> against simulated attacks by PT-13 and PT-17 Stearman biplane aircraft.|$|R

Sharik is very ashamed at being saved by the very animals that he planned to hunt, so he decided to do fishing instead. However Sharik gets depressed, because he could not satisfy his hunting instinct by shooting from the gun. Fedya eventually presents him with a <b>camera</b> <b>gun</b> for wildlife photography.

50|$|The Avia BH-22 was {{a trainer}} {{aircraft}} built in Czechoslovakia in 1925, {{based on the}} BH-21 fighter. A smaller engine was used and armament removed. The lighter engine required the wing stagger to be decreased. No significant modifications {{were made to the}} airframe structure, reduced weight further increasing the ultimate load factor (the BH-21 was designed to 12.5g). Some aeroplanes carried a <b>camera</b> <b>gun.</b> The type saw long service as a special aerobatic trainer and eventually several examples found their way into Czechoslovakia's aero clubs.|$|E

Crew of two, sitting in tandem, with dual controls (instructor in front, student in rear). Some had an elevated canvas cover above the student's cockpit for blind flying training. Engine: 9-cylinder Wright Whirlwind J-5B air-cooled radial engine, built under licence in the Polish Avia works. Two-blade wooden propeller of fixed pitch.

5000|$|I {{opened fire}} with all guns, my {{starboard}} cannon stopping almost immediately ... strikes were observed {{on the port}} side of the enemy aircraft fuselage, the starboard engine and tail unit. The starboard engine and fuselage immediately caught fire and some pieces of flying debris hit my own plane ... I flew behind it for several miles; it was now burning at three points and trailing white smoke ... The enemy aircraft appeared to make an attempt to level out momentarily and hit the water at a point 20 miles kilometres due west of Cape Fourcroy. I photographed the splash with my <b>camera</b> <b>gun</b> and flew at zero feet around the debris observing three bodies in the water, two of which had partially opened parachutes attached ... One body was that of a large man in a black flying suit and helmet; he was lying spreadeagled on top of the water, face upward and I gained the impression that he was still alive.|$|E
5000|$|Rather {{than being}} fitted {{instead of a}} {{synchronised}} weapon, the Foster-mounted Lewis in the S.E.5 was fitted in addition. The two guns were normally used together, both being aimed through an Aldis sight, implying a degree of harmonization; but in some respects this arrangement was less than ideal. Replacement of the"hybrid" [...] S.E.5 armament with twin guns (either two Vickers or two Foster mounted Lewis guns) was considered, but it was calculated that the centre section of the upper wing would have required reinforcement {{to cope with the}} recoil and vibration of two Lewis guns firing simultaneously. Twin-gun versions of the hydraulic C.C. synchronisation gear were not available until late 1917, and the early examples were required to replace the inferior Sopwith-Kauper gears used in early Camels, so that the armament of the S.E.5a remained the same throughout its production life. On S.E.5s that were used by advanced training units in 1918 the Foster mounting proved amenable for the Hythe <b>camera</b> <b>gun,</b> one of the first of its kind. Reflections from the spinning propeller that may have interfered with pictures taken by a cowl mounted [...] "gun" [...] were avoided.|$|E

5000|$|In 1944, Harlingen began {{training}} B-29 Superfortress gunners. They received {{practically the}} same training {{as those for}} other aircraft, {{but at the end}} of the year a few of them began to receive training in B-24s modified by the addition of central fire control turrets to make them more like B-29s. Among the training devices used in this instruction was the manipulation trainer—12 towers arranged to resemble a formation of planes.

25|$|On 1 April 1, 1918 {{preparations}} got underway for {{the opening}} of a new gunnery school. Instructors were borrowed from the French, British and Canadian flying corps. By July 1918, Selfridge had reached its peak performance in gunnery training. Over 250 students were enrolled at one time, and on one occasion 52 planes were in the air over the field simultaneously. Classes were so filled that 150 Lewis air guns, 60 Lewis ground guns, 80 Marlin air <b>guns,</b> 90 <b>camera</b> <b>guns</b> and 10 aerial cameras were in use daily. By the end of World War I, the young base had 1,028 enlisted men and 200 officers. It had trained 72 pilots and 700. mechanics, and 1,002 men had attended gunnery school.|$|R
