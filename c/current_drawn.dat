5|$|Low-power and {{high-power}} devices remain operational {{with this}} standard, but devices using SuperSpeed {{can take advantage}} of increased available current of between 150mA and 900mA, respectively. Additionally, there is a Battery Charging Specification (Version 1.2– December 2010), which increases the power handling capability to 1.5A but does not allow concurrent data transmission. The Battery Charging Specification requires that the physical ports themselves be capable of handling 5A of current but limits the maximum <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> to 1.5A.|$|E
25|$|The <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> {{is nearly}} fixed over {{a range of}} load voltages, to one {{electron}} per converted photon. The quantum efficiency, or probability of getting an electron of photocurrent per incident photon, depends not only upon the solar cell itself, but upon the spectrum of the light.|$|E
25|$|Quiescent {{current in}} a {{regulator}} circuit is the <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> internally, {{not available to}} the load, normally measured as the input current while no load is connected and hence a source of inefficiency (some linear regulators are, surprisingly, more efficient at very low current loads than switch-mode designs because of this).|$|E

25|$|Linear loads {{with low}} power factor (such as {{induction}} motors) can be corrected with a passive network of capacitors or inductors. Non-linear loads, such as rectifiers, distort the <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> from the system. In such cases, active or passive {{power factor correction}} {{may be used to}} counteract the distortion and raise the power factor. The devices for correction of the power factor may be at a central substation, spread out over a distribution system, or built into power-consuming equipment.|$|E
25|$|To {{avoid the}} loading of the {{measured}} circuit by the <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> {{by the meter}} movement, some analog multimeters use an amplifier inserted between the measured circuit and the meter movement. While this increases the expense {{and complexity of the}} meter, by use of vacuum tubes or field effect transistors the input resistance can be made very high and independent of the current required to operate the meter movement coil. Such amplified multimeters are called VTVMs (vacuum tube voltmeters), TVMs (transistor volt meters), FET-VOMs, and similar names.|$|E
25|$|The {{output voltage}} of the {{stabilizer}} {{is equal to}} the Zener diode voltage minus the base–emitter voltage of the transistor, UZ − UBE, where UBE is usually about 0.7V for a silicon transistor, depending on the load current. If the output voltage drops for any external reason, such as an increase in the <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> by the load (causing a decrease in the Collector-Emitter junction voltage to observe KVL), the transistor's base–emitter voltage (UBE) increases, turning the transistor on further and delivering more current to increase the load voltage again.|$|E
5000|$|Inductive {{pumps are}} {{designed}} for increased efficiency and were intended to reduce energy consumption {{in an environment that}} is increasingly demanding energy conservation. Most electric motors are on average about 85% efficient as evidenced by the usual stall test that shows a marked increase in <b>current</b> <b>draw</b> when the motor is stopped mechanically. Inductive pumps show no increase in <b>current</b> <b>draw</b> when stalled during operation as better than 95% of the current is being used to create a force on the piston.|$|R
50|$|Even later (1998) Microchip Technology {{introduced}} the improved PIC16F84A which allowed for faster clock speeds (up to 20 MHz), faster programming, and decreased the <b>current</b> <b>draw</b> of the chip.|$|R
25|$|For some configurations, the {{arrangement}} of pins will differ slightly for the different current ratings, to prevent accidental mating of devices with a higher <b>current</b> <b>draw</b> than the receptacle can support.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> {{into the}} {{operational}} amplifier {{from the power}} supply {{can be used as}} inputs to external circuitry that augment the capabilities of the operational amplifier. For example, an operational amplifier may not be fit for a particular high-gain application because its output would be required to generate signals outside of the safe range generated by the amplifier. In this case, an external pushpull amplifier can be controlled by the current {{into and out of the}} operational amplifier. Thus, the operational amplifier may itself operate within its factory specified bounds while still allowing the negative feedback path to include a large output signal well outside of those bounds.|$|E
25|$|Inrush {{current or}} input surge current or switch-on surge is the maximum, {{instantaneous}} input <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> by an electrical device when first turned on. Inrush current usually lasts {{for half a}} second, or a few milliseconds, but it is often very high, which makes it dangerous because it can degrade and burn components gradually (over months or years), especially {{if there is no}} inrush current protection. Alternating current transformers or electric motors in automatic voltage regulators may draw and output several times their normal full-load current for a few cycles of the input waveform when first energized or switched on. Power converters also often have inrush currents much higher than their steady state currents, due to the charging current of the input capacitance.|$|E
25|$|The meter {{movement}} in a moving pointer analog multimeter is practically always a moving-coil galvanometer of the d'Arsonval type, using either jeweled pivots or taut bands {{to support the}} moving coil. In a basic analog multimeter the current to deflect the coil and pointer is drawn from the circuit being measured; it is usually an advantage to minimize the <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> from the circuit, which implies delicate mechanisms. The sensitivity of an analog multimeter is given in units of ohms per volt. For example, a very low cost multimeter with a sensitivity of 1000 ohms per volt would draw 1milliampere from a circuit at full scale deflection. More expensive, (and mechanically more delicate) multimeters typically have sensitivities of 20,000 ohms per volt and sometimes higher, with 50,000 ohms per volt (drawing 20microamperes at full scale) being about the upper limit for a portable, general purpose, non-amplified analog multimeter.|$|E

50|$|Typical {{computer}} {{power supplies}} may have power factors {{as low as}} 0.5 to 0.6. The higher power factor reduces the peak <b>current</b> <b>draw,</b> reducing load on the circuit or on an uninterruptible power supply.|$|R

25|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, {{the power}} factor of an AC {{electrical power system}} {{is defined as the}} ratio of the real power flowing to the load to the apparent power in the circuit, and is a dimensionless number in the closed interval of −1 to 1. A power factor of less than one means that the voltage and current waveforms are not in phase, reducing the instantaneous product of the two waveforms (V × I). Real power is the capacity of the circuit for performing work in a particular time. Apparent power is the product of the current and voltage of the circuit. Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source, or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> from the source, the apparent power will be greater than the real power. A negative power factor occurs when the device (which is normally the load) generates power, which then flows back towards the source, which is normally considered the generator.|$|E
25|$|In 1878, Edison {{began working}} on a system of {{electrical}} illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting. He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, {{something that would be}} needed for indoor use. Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta's demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer, William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich Göbel. Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and high electric <b>current</b> <b>drawn,</b> making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially. Edison realized that to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size and using the necessary thickness of copper wire, he would have to develop a lamp that used a low amount of current. This lamp must have high resistance and use relatively low voltage (around 110 volts).|$|E
25|$|When {{power is}} first {{applied to the}} circuit, {{there will be a}} glow {{discharge}} across the electrodes in the starter lamp. This heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by thermionic emission. In the starter, the touching contacts short out the voltage sustaining the glow discharge, extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch, which opens within a second or two. The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an inductive kick which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect). A power factor correction (PFC) capacitor draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> by the lamp circuit.|$|E

5000|$|In {{hydraulic}} elevator systems, {{emergency power}} will lower the elevators {{to the lowest}} landing and open the doors to allow passengers to exit. The doors then close after an adjustable time period and the car remains unusable until reset, usually by cycling the elevator main power switch. Typically, due to the high <b>current</b> <b>draw</b> when starting the pump motor, hydraulic elevators are not run using standard emergency power systems. Buildings like hospitals and nursing homes usually size their emergency generators to accommodate this draw. However, {{the increasing use of}} current-limiting motor starters, commonly known as [...] "soft-start" [...] contactors, avoid much of this problem, and the <b>current</b> <b>draw</b> of the pump motor is less of a limiting concern.|$|R

50|$|With an {{increasing}} continental shelf slope, current velocity increases, as {{the velocity of}} the flow increases, turbulence increases, and the <b>current</b> <b>draws</b> up more sediment.

2500|$|The {{input stage}} of a CFL is a rectifier, which {{presents}} a non-linear load to the power supply and introduces harmonic distortion on the <b>current</b> <b>drawn</b> from the supply.

The power factor of CFLs does not significantly affect their energy-saving benefits for individual consumers, but their use in large numbers—such as in commercial applications or across millions of homes in a distribution system—could require infrastructure upgrades. [...] In such cases, CFLs with low (below 30 percent) total harmonic distortion (THD) and power factors greater than 0.9 should be selected.|$|E
