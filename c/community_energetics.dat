40|$|Recent global {{synthetic}} analyses {{have revealed}} that marine taxonomic inventories are far from complete, nowhere {{more so than in}} the deep-pelagic ocean. At over a billion km 3, it is the largest biome on Earth, yet {{only a tiny fraction of}} the biogeographic records include the bathypelagic fauna. This data gap served as the impetus for recent deepwater surveys, many of which have altered our perceptions of pelagic ecosystems. Here we examine data from four deep-pelagic (0 - 5000 + m) sampling programs in the Atlantic (60 °N- 25 °S) in order to assess the character of bathypelagic fish communities with respect to faunal distinctiveness and ecological connectivity. Regions studied include the Gulf of Mexico, Sargasso 702 Sea, eastern North/South Atlantic, and mid-North Atlantic. Quantitative analyses give contrasting pictures with respect to faunal composition and ecosystem operation. The discreteness of the bathypelagic zone is exhibited faunistically by the suite of ―holobathypelagic‖ species found only below 1000 m, most of which are highly modified morphologically. Geometric abundance class analyses reveal that the character of relative species abundance distributions between the meso- and bathypelagic zones is fundamentally dissimilar; the former exhibit a much higher proportion of common species, while the latter exhibit a much higher percentage of rarer species. From a <b>community</b> <b>energetics</b> perspective, however, the bathy- and mesopelagic zones are highly interconnected. Approximately 70...|$|E
40|$|Interannual {{environmental}} {{variability in}} Peru {{is dominated by}} the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The most dramatic changes are associated with the warm El Niño (EN) phase (opposite the cold La Niña phase), which disrupts the normal coastal upwelling and affects the dynamics of many coastal marine and terrestrial resources. This study presents a trophic model for Sechura Bay, located at the northern extension of the Peruvian upwelling system, where ENSO-induced environmental variability is most extreme. Using an initial steady-state model for the year 1996, we explore the dynamics of the ecosystem through the year 2003 (including the strong EN of 1997 / 98 and the weaker EN of 2002 / 03). Based on support from literature, we force biomass of several non-trophically-mediated 'drivers' (e. g. Scallops, Benthic detritivores, Octopus, and Littoral fish) to observe whether the fit between historical and simulated changes (by the trophic model) is improved. The results indicate that the Sechura Bay Ecosystem is a relatively inefficient system from a <b>community</b> <b>energetics</b> point of view, likely due to the periodic perturbations of ENSO. A combination of high system productivity and low trophic level target species of invertebrates (i. e. scallops) and fish (i. e. anchoveta) results in high catches and an efficient fishery. The importance of environmental drivers is suggested, given the relatively small improvements in the fit of the simulation with the addition of trophic drivers on remaining functional groups' dynamics. An additional multivariate regression model is presented for the scallop Argopecten purpuratus, which demonstrates a significant correlation between both spawning stock size and riverine discharge-mediated mortality on catch levels. These results are discussed {{in the context of the}} appropriateness of trophodynamic modeling in relatively open systems, and how management strategies may be focused given the highly environmentally influenced marine resources of the region...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} 11 of 24 ecosystem {{attributes that}} Odum (1969) proposed would change during succession in avian communities in meadow, aspen, fir, and spruce forests in northern Utah and southern Idaho. A total of 71 bird species was observed during the 30 -month study, of which 43 {{were known to}} breed. Yearly energetic relationships were calculated for the breeding bird populations using an avian <b>community</b> <b>energetics</b> model. In the different avian communities, the ratios of annual secondary production/community respiration, secondary production/biomass present, and secondary production/ consumption all tended to decrease with increasing plant succession; biomass present/ 2 ̆ 2 unit energy flow 2 ̆ 2 tended to increase. All of these trends {{are consistent with those}} postulated by Odum for the entire ecosystem. These energetics ratios differed in 1977 from those in 1976 and 1978 due to a severe drought. They also fluctuated greatly {{during the course of a}} year. Avian species diversity was highest in the preclimax fir forest during the breeding season and fluctuated widely in the nonbreeding season. Species equitability tended to be relatively high in all avian communities, although it was slightly lower during the nonbreeding season. No trends were found in male body sizes, mean clutch size, and mean length of incubation period (a crude measure of parental investment). Thus, for the bird communities, we reject the postulated trends of increased species diversity, equitability, and organism size in the climax, quantity to quality production, and r- to K-selection. During the drought of 1977 the spruce avifauna appeared more stable, so we cannot reject Odum 2 ̆ 7 s hypothesized trend of increased stability in the climax. We conclude that the vegetational characteristics of a given sere will in most cases determine the avian population response along that sere; this in turn will influence the correspondence of the avian communities to Odum 2 ̆ 7 s postulates. Incorporating these avian results with other studies within our subalpine sere, some of Odum 2 ̆ 7 s hypothesized trends are supported while others are not, suggesting that successional relationships are more complicated than would follow from Odum 2 ̆ 7 s relatively simple model...|$|E

40|$|In {{a series}} of {{community}} food webs from native and agricultural soils, we modeled energetics and stability, and evaluated {{the role of the}} various groups of organisms and their interactions in energy flow and community stability. Species were aggregated into functional groups based on their trophic position in the food webs. Energy flow rates among the groups were calculated by a model using observations on population sizes, death rates, specific feeding preferences and energy conversion efficiencies. From the energetic organization of the communities we derived the strengths of the mutual effects among the populations. These interaction strengths were found to be patterned {{in a way that is}} important to community stability. The patterning consisted of the simultaneous occurrence of strong top down effects at lower trophic levels and strong bottom up effects at higher trophic levels. These patterns resulted directly from the empirical data we used to parameterize the model, as we found no stabilizing patterns with random but plausible parameter values. Also, the impact of each individual interaction on community stability was established. This analysis showed that some interactions had a relatively strong impact on stability, whereas other interactions had only a small impact. These impacts on stability were neither correlated with energy flow nor with interaction strength. Comparison of the seven food webs showed that these impacts were sometimes connected to particular groups of organisms involved in the interaction, but sometimes they were not, which might be due to different trophic positions in the food webs. We argue that future research should be directed to answer the question which energetic properties of the organisms form the basis of the patterning of the interaction strengths, as this would improve our understanding of the interrelationships between <b>energetics,</b> <b>community</b> stability, and hence the maintenance of biological diversity...|$|R
40|$|Small cryptic fishes {{represent}} over 50 % of fishes on coral reefs. Yet {{our knowledge}} of them lags far behind that of larger species and their significance to coral reef ecosystems remains unclear. Vastly different in their ecology due to their small size, this thesis examines their community structure and identifies key life history features that highlight their unique ecological status. These results are combined to model the relative contribution of small cryptic fishes to reef fish assemblages and define their significance to coral reef ecosystems. Small-scale clove oil samples (0. 4 m 2) were used to quantify the spatial distribution of small (< 10 cm) cryptic fishes across reef zones and microhabitats at both exposed and sheltered reefs. Marked variation in abundance, species numbers, size-class distribution and community composition were found among reef zones at exposed sites; in contrast, comparatively little among-zone variation was found at sheltered sites. At exposed sites, {{there was a strong}} trend of declining abundance, species numbers and larger body sizes with increasing wave energy; whereas at sheltered sites, microhabitat type played a more important role. There was little taxonomic overlap between sheltered and exposed reefs even of highly abundant species. Overall, wave energy was found to play a pivotal role in the spatial distribution of this community with microhabitat type playing a significant, yet secondary role. Contrasting the life history (LH) characteristics of the most abundant genus (Eviota: 3 species of Gobiidae) at the two study sites with those of existing coral reef fishes in a meta-analysis revealed vastly different LH features. Otolith analysis revealed rapid linear growth trajectories and extremely short maximum life spans of < 100 days (E. queenslandica 99 days; E. melasma 97 days and E. sigillata at 59 days - the shortest recorded lifespan for any vertebrate). Although settlement marks on otoliths disclosed unremarkable pelagic larval durations (PLDs) of 24 - 26 days, this represented 24 - 42 % of their total lifespan. The complete lack of response in shortening PLDs to compensate for such short life spans suggests that developmental constraints may be the primary determinant of PLDs in coral reef fishes. Histological examinations indicated that Eviota mature at an earlier than expected size and showed a strong female bias in their sex ratios (1 ♂: 1. 4 - 1. 7 ♀) indicating the possibility of protogyny or harem keeping by males. A field tagging study indicated remarkably high daily mortality rates of 7 - 8 % which closely matched otolith-based estimates of 4 - 7 % d- 1. An experimental breeding study using E. sigillata revealed a frequent semi-lunar spawning pattern and batch sizes of 108 - 163 eggs. Although small in comparison to those of larger species, the frequency of spawning events coupled with generational turnover rates of 47 days indicated potential annual offspring production to be orders of magnitude higher than that of much larger reef fish species. Collectively, these LH attributes revealed how the smallest of reef fish size-classes respond to their vastly different ecological environments and highlight the extensive range and versatility of coral reef fish evolutionary strategies. The relative contribution of the small cryptic group to reef fish assemblages was examined using visual censuses of 14 coral reef fish families. In total, data on 58, 944 fish were utilized over five reef zones providing 86 g m- 2 of biomass. The clear trend among size-class distributions was one of rapidly decreasing densities with increasing size. Small cryptic fishes represented 45 - 90 % of the numbers of individuals across reef zones with a reef average contribution of 67 %. Among families, the numerical dominance of the Gobiidae was evident (11 m- 2 ± 1. 4 SE) with significant contributions made by the Pomacentridae, Apogonidae, Blenniidae, Labridae and Tripterygiidae. For biomass, the Acanthuridae made the largest contribution (35 g m- 2 ± 11. 6 SE) followed by the Pomacentridae, Scaridae and Serranidae. Small cryptic families made up < 3 %. To examine the implications of taxa-specific growth rates in the energy dynamics of coral reef systems, a community growth model was produced. Sizespecific growth estimates for all genera censused were calculated over a 7 -day period. Overall, small cryptic fishes contributed 79. 5 % to reef fish assemblage patterns of growth in length and 14 % to the period’s total weight accumulation in grams. This cryptic contribution stands in marked contrast to the static biomass estimate presented above and highlights the significance of LH’s in defining <b>community</b> and ecosystem <b>energetics.</b> Overall, small cryptic fishes make a substantial contribution to coral reef communities but differ considerably from their larger counterparts in the way they achieve this. Demographic evidence of drastically shortened life spans, rapid linear growth and high turnover rates, coupled with high average abundances and rates of mortality suggests they {{play a significant role in}} the energetics of coral reefs. This addition of demographic information on small cryptic reef fishes emphasized this role, uncovered new extremes in vertebrate biology and showcases the rich potential for coral reef fishes to test general life history theory...|$|R
40|$|Leach's Storm—Petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa), the {{smallest}} and most abundant seabirds that breed {{in the northwest}} Atlantic, are not usually included in avian energetics models. To round out an energy analysis of seabirds spanning {{the full range of}} body sizes in the northwest Atlantic, the field metabolic rates (FMRs) of breeding Leach's Storm—Petrels were measured using doubly labeled water techniques (DLW). Metabolic, dietary and, demographic data were used as inputs in a populations energetics model to estimate the energy requirements and prey harvests of the Leach's Storm—Petrel population of eastern North America. FMRs of storm—petrels that remained in burrows averaged 83. 3 ± 19. 4 KJ/d. FMRs increased significantly with time (i. e., x in hours per day) at sea (y = [85. 8 ± 6. 5] + [3. 13 ± 0. 48]x), and metabolism at sea was estimated to be 161 ± 18 KJ/d. FMRs integrated over activity on land and activity at sea averaged 124 KJ/d during incubation and 142 KJ/d during chick rearing. Incubating adults weighed significantly more than adults rearing chicks, although adult mass did not vary with age of chick. Basal metabolic rate (BMR, measured as O 2 flux) averaged 2. 02 ± 1. 01 cm 3 °g— 1 °h— 1, equivalent to 45. 4 ± 30. 4 KJ/d, very similar to values obtained for breeding conspecifics in the Bay of Fundy and in the Bering Sea. Thermal conductance averaged 0. 124 ± 0. 065 cm 3 °g— 1 °h— 1 °°C— 1. FMR/BMR ratios averaged 2. 73 for incubating birds and 3. 13 for birds rearing young. Population energetics modelling indicated that during a 7 —mo breeding period Leach's Storm—Petrels at colonies in the northwest Atlantic Ocean consume > 74 000 Mg of prey, mostly myctophids and amphipods (mostly Hyperia galba), as wall as euphausiids (mostly Meganyctiphanes norvegica) and other prey (decapods, copepods, isopods). Leach's Storm—Petrels make up ° 80 % of the breeding seabird population in eastern Canada, but owing to small body size and metabolic efficiency, they account for comparatively little of the energy that flows through the avian assemblage of the northwest Atlantic. An intra—specific, inter—colony difference in FMR is suggested: FMRs measured in a Newfoundland colony were significantly higher than those determined with the same DLW procedure in the Bay of Fundy near the southern limit of the species' breeding range in the northwest Atlantic. Differences in ambient temperatures and wind speed associated with different oceanographic regimes may generate energetic differences. Like inter—colony differences in feeding ecology, inter—colony differences in FMR need to be considered in population and <b>community</b> <b>energetics</b> models and in meso— and mega—scale extrapolations...|$|E
