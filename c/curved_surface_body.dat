The investigation includes three fringe projection systems, two stereo image-based matching methods and one object-based multi-image matching method. The accuracy is assessed by use of a 3 D <b>surface</b> reference <b>body</b> consisting of a double sine <b>curved</b> <b>surface.</b> The reference <b>body</b> has been calibrated by a coordinate measuring machine whereby the measured 3 D points are used to calculate a NURB splines surface model. The resulting CAD model {{is used as a}} reference for the optical measurements. The surface has Lambertian reflectance properties, thus fringe projection systems can be used without object preparation.

The low-level operations include constructing <b>curves</b> and <b>surfaces</b> (canonical objects, NURBS, offset <b>curves</b> and <b>surfaces,</b> and so on), projecting points and <b>curves</b> on <b>surfaces,</b> intersecting and extending <b>curves</b> and <b>surfaces,</b> modifying topology (including Euler operations), and so on. Low-level operations enable application developers to modify kernel {{data in a}} most flexible manner, practically operating in manual mode. High-level operations include operations that are standard for body generation, and Boolean operations on bodies (union, subtract, and intersect).

40|$|Tactile shear {{stresses}} {{play an important}} role in the medical field and robotics. To monitor these stresses in situ, there is a need for unobtrusive flexible sensors that can be wrapped around <b>curved</b> <b>surfaces</b> or moving <b>body</b> parts. The presented sensor is based on changing coupling of optical power between a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) and a photodiode facing each other and separated by a deformable transducer layer. The required optoelectronic components were embedded in a polymer foil of only 40 mu m thick, yielding a very thin and flexible total sensor stack of 250 mu m thick. In the linear part of the range (between 2 and 5. 5 N), the sensitivity of the prototype was - 350 mu A/N; the maximum measurable force was 5. 5 N. However, by selecting the appropriate deformable sensor transducer material, the sensitivity and range can be tuned for a specific application...|$|R
40|$|Boundary-layer flow over bodies such as {{aircraft}} wings or turbine blades {{is characterized by}} a pressure gradient due to the <b>curved</b> <b>surface</b> of the <b>body.</b> The boundary layer may experience modal and non-modal instability, and the type of dominant instability depends on whether the body is swept with respect to the oncoming flow or not. The growth of these disturbances causes transition of the boundary-layer flow to turbulence. Provided that they are convective in nature, the instabilities will only arise and persist if the boundary layer is continuously exposed to a perturbation environment. This may for example consist of turbulent fluctuations or sound waves in the free stream or of non-uniformities on the <b>surface</b> of the <b>body.</b> In engineering, it is of relevance to understand how susceptive to such perturbations the boundary layer is, and this issue is subject of receptivity analysis.   In this thesis, receptivity of simplified prototypes for flow past a wing is studied. In particular, the three-dimensional swept-plate boundary layer and the boundary layer forming on a flat plate with elliptic leading edge are considered. The response of the boundary layer to vortical free-stream disturbances and surface roughness is analyzed, receptivity mechanisms are identified and their efficiency is quantified.

Hydraulic transfer is generally used for printing on <b>curved</b> <b>surfaces</b> [24, 25]. By floating a printed film on water and pressing a <b>curved</b> <b>surface</b> onto the film, uniform printing on the <b>curved</b> <b>surface</b> is obtained. Retinal vessels on a <b>curved</b> <b>surface</b> are obtained by overlaying patterned PDMS sheets on a <b>curved</b> <b>surface,</b> {{as shown in}} Fig. 5.

40|$|Lattice Boltzmann method {{combined}} with large eddy simulation is {{developed in the}} article to simulate fluid flow at high Reynolds numbers. A subgrid model {{is used as a}} large eddy simulation model in the numerical simulation for high Reynolds flow. The idea of subgrid model is based on an assumption to include the physical effects that the unresolved motion has on the resolved fluid motion. It takes a simple form of eddy viscosity models for the Reynolds stress. Lift and drag evaluation in the lattice Boltzmann equation takes momentum-exchange method for <b>curved</b> <b>body</b> <b>surface.</b> First of all, the present numerical method is validated at low Reynolds numbers. Second, the developed lattice Boltzmann method/large eddy simulation method is performed to solve flow problems at high Reynolds numbers.

40|$|In {{order to}} perform {{underwater}} surveillance, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) require flexible, light-weight, reliable and robust sensing {{systems that are}} capable of flow sensing and detecting underwater objects. Underwater animals like fish perform a similar task using an efficient and ubiquitous sensory system called a lateral-line constituting of an array of pressure-gradient sensors. We demonstrate here the development of arrays of polymer microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) pressure sensors which are flexible and can be readily mounted on <b>curved</b> <b>surfaces</b> of AUV <b>bodies.</b> An array of ten sensors with a footprint of 60 (L) mm × 25 (W) mm × 0. 4 (H) mm is fabricated using liquid crystal polymer (LCP) as the sensing membrane material. The flow sensing and object detection capabilities of the array are illustrated with proof-of-concept experiments conducted in a water tunnel. The sensors demonstrate a pressure sensitivity of 14. 3 μV Pa⁻¹. A high resolution of 25 mm s⁻¹ is achieved in water flow sensing. The sensors can passively sense underwater objects by transducing the pressure variations generated underwater by the movement of objects. The experimental results demonstrate the array's ability to detect the velocity of underwater objects towed past by with high accuracy, and an average error of only 2. 5 %. 13 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{based on}} the idea of profit and loss modification, we present the {{iterative}} non-uniform B-spline <b>curve</b> and <b>surface</b> to settle a key problem in computer aided geometric design and reverse engineering, that is, constructing the <b>curve</b> (<b>surface)</b> fitting (interpolating) a given ordered point set without solving a linear system. We start with a piece of initial non-uniform B-spline <b>curve</b> (<b>surface)</b> which takes the given point set as its control point set. Then by adjusting its control points gradually with iterative formula, we can get a group of non-uniform B-spline <b>curves</b> (<b>surfaces)</b> with gradually higher precision. In this paper, using modern matrix theory, we strictly prove that the limit <b>curve</b> (<b>surface)</b> of the iteration interpolates the given point set.
