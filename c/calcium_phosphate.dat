5|$|Excess calcium in {{the urine}} (hypercalciuria) occurs due to {{increased}} bone demineralisation with acidosis. Bones {{are mainly composed of}} <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate.</b> The phosphate reacts with the acid, and the calcium is excreted by the kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Enamel's {{primary mineral}} is hydroxyapatite, {{which is a}} {{crystalline}} <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate.</b> The large amount of minerals in enamel accounts {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. Unlike dentin and bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Proteins of note in the development of enamel are ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins and tuftelins. It is believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as framework support, among other functions.|$|E

5|$|Both {{groups have}} a shell {{consisting}} of two valves, but {{the organization of the}} shell is quite different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, the valves are on the left and right sides of the body, and are, in most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a coiled, rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates, the bryozoans and the phoronids. Brachiopod shells are often made of <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> as well as calcium carbonate, whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of calcium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Cerium has {{no known}} {{biological}} role in humans, {{but is not}} very toxic either; it does not accumulate in the food chain to any appreciable extent. Because it often occurs together with calcium in phosphate minerals, and bones are primarily <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> cerium can accumulate in bones in small amounts that are not considered dangerous. Cerium, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. Cerium nitrate is an effective topical antimicrobial treatment for third-degree burns, although large doses can lead to cerium poisoning and methemoglobinemia. The early lanthanides act as essential cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, for which lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium alone are about equally effective.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of sharks dates from the Ordovician period, 450–420 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before many plants had colonized the continents. Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans. The oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago, in the Silurian period. The first sharks looked very different from modern sharks. The majority of modern sharks {{can be traced back to}} around 100 million years ago. Most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> an apatite. When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments.|$|E
40|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> have {{important}} role in biological and pathological mineralization. While only one of <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates,</b> carbonate apatite, represents the main mineral component of teeth and bones, octacalcium <b>phosphate,</b> <b>calcium</b> hydrogenphosphate dihydrate and beta-tricalcium phosphate occur in pathological deposits. From the stand-point of chemists, processes of biological and pathological mineralization could be considered as deposition of inorganic phase within organic matrix, i. e. formation of inorganic-organic composites. Although this approach is very simplified at first glance, it allows clarification of important issues related to biomineralization (e. g. {{what is the role}} of individual components of organic matrix in the emerging solid tissue), and design and preparation of new materials for hard tissue regeneration (e. g. process of transformation after implantation).

40|$|The {{history of}} <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> in the {{medicine}} field starts in 1769 {{when the first}} evidence of its existence in the bone tissue is discovered. Since then, the interest for <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> has increased among the scientific community. Their study has been developed in parallel with new advances in materials sciences, medicine or tissue engineering areas. Bone tissue engineering is the field where <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> have had a great importance. While the first bioceramics are selected according to bioinert, biocompatibility and mechanical properties with the aim to replace bone tissue damaged, <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> open {{the way to the}} bone tissue regeneration challenge.

25|$|The first theory {{attributed}} to de Kruif and Holt, proposes that nanoclusters of <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> and the phosphopeptide fraction of beta-casein are the centerpiece to micellular structure. Specifically in this view, unstructured proteins organize around the <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{giving rise to}} their structure and thus no specific structure is formed.|$|E
25|$|The second theory {{proposed}} by Horne, {{the growth of}} <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> nanoclusters begins the process of micelle formation but is limited by binding phosphopeptide loop regions of the caseins. Once bound, protein-protein interactions are formed and polymerization occurs, in which K-casein is used as an end cap, to form micelles with trapped <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> nanoclusters.|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} chemical, {{structural and}} morphological properties of <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> are highly {{sensitive to the}} changes of synthesis conditions. As many characteristics, e. g., purity, solubility, bioactivity, depend on chemical composition and crystal structure of synthesized <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> it has been studied extensively during last year. Influence of technological parameters on chemical composition of as-prepared and calcined <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> samples was investigated. <b>Calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> powders have been synthesized by wet-chemical precipitation rout using CaCO 3 and H 3 PO 4 as starting materials. These synthesis series vary with following technological parameters: temperature of the suspension {{during the process of}} synthesis (T, °C), ending pH value, aging time of suspension (τ, h) and thermal processing (T, °C; τ, h). The identification and characterization of obtained <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> powders chemical composition has been made with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy method. FT-IR spectra of as-synthesized <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> powders showed characteristic chemical bands (PO 4 3 -, OH-, H 2 O absorbed, CO 32 -, HPO 4 2 -) at definite wave number ranges. The as-synthesized powders are non-stoichiometric hydroxylapatite (HAp) with the presence of CO 3 2 -, OH- and H 2 O absorbed bands. Carbonate and OH- absorbed bands can be perfectly removed after calcination above 900 °C. The experimental results of X-ray diffraction and FT-IR spectra have shown the presence of biphasic mixtures containing HAp and β-tricalciumphosphate (β-TCP).

The mineralization pattern of the composites, after soaking in the Ca(OH) 2 aqueous solution, clearly demonstrated oriented, needle-like nanocrystallites of <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> in the matrix with especially high Ca/P molar ratio (3. 98) as detected by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis. Subsequent to mineralization in a simulated body fluid (SBF), the mineralized composites showed micro-scaled spherical aggregates deposited on the surface and granule-like nanocrystallites grew in the matrix. The Ca/P molar ratio (1. 72) and X-ray diffraction pattern of the nanocrystallites grown in the composites were similar to those of hydroxyapatite (HAp). Osteoblastic differentiation of ROS cells cultured on the mineralized composites allowed an enhanced expression of the chosen osteogenic marker (alkaline phosphatase, ALPase).
