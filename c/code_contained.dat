5|$|The first (and only) {{production}} model (serial number S5, named Graywolf) was loaned to NCAR {{as a demonstration}} system in May 1993. NCAR's version was configured with 4 processors and a 128MWord (64-bit words, 1GB) common memory. In service, the static RAM proved to be problematic. It was also discovered that the square root <b>code</b> <b>contained</b> a bug that resulted in 1 in 60 million calculations being wrong. Additionally, {{one of the four}} CPUs was not running reliably.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic cause had a {{drawback}} while Stephan Dushan {{ruled in}} Albania. The Catholic rite was called Latin heresy and Dushan's <b>code</b> <b>contained</b> harsh measures against them. However, the persecutions of local catholic Albanians {{did not begin}} in 1349 when the Code was promulgated, but much earlier, {{at least since the}} beginning of 14th century. Under these circumstances the relations between local Catholic Albanians and the papal curia became very close.|$|E

The Catholic influence on the Code was initially kept secret. [...] A recurring theme was [...] "throughout, the audience feels sure that evil is wrong and good is right."

500|$|Posters and {{publicity}} photos were often tantalizing. Women appeared in poses and garb not even glimpsed {{in the films}} themselves. In some cases actresses with small parts in films (or {{in the case of}} Dolores Murray in her publicity still for The Common Law, no part at all) appeared scantily clad. Hays became outraged at the steamy pictures circulating in newspapers around the country. The original Hays <b>Code</b> <b>contained</b> an often-ignored note about advertising imagery, but he wrote an entirely new advertising screed {{in the style of the}} Ten Commandments that contained a set of twelve prohibitions. The first seven addressed imagery. They prohibited women in undergarments, women raising their skirts, suggestive poses, kissing, necking, and other suggestive material. The last five concerned advertising copy and prohibited misrepresentation of the film's contents, [...] "salacious copy", and the word [...] "courtesan".|$|E

2500|$|The <b>code</b> <b>contained</b> 63 titles, with 6,571 {{consecutively}} numbered sections, and {{was published}} in an oversized, unannotated single volume and a two volume annotated edition. [...] Neither version of the Code of 1919 had any provision for supplementation, and so the Code of 1919 quickly became outdated, so {{that as soon as}} 1923, the director of the State Legislative Reference Bureau published General Laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia to incorporate amendments and assign section numbers to new statutes.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990), was a U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} that filled {{in an important}} gap in the federal criminal law of sentencing. The federal criminal code does not contain a definition of many crimes, including burglary, the crime at issue in this case. Yet sentencing enhancements applicable to federal crimes allow for the enhancement of a defendant's sentence if he has been convicted of prior felonies. The Court addressed in this case how [...] "burglary" [...] should be defined for purposes of such sentencing enhancements when the federal criminal <b>code</b> <b>contained</b> no definition of [...] "burglary." [...] The approach the Court adopted in this case has guided the lower federal courts in interpreting other provisions of the criminal code that also refer to generic crimes not otherwise defined in federal law.|$|E

This complaint forced Bourguiba to intervene, publicly and by name. On September 7, he asked members of the religious courts for their opinions concerning the Code's conformity with religious law. On September 14, thirteen members of the higher court published a fatwa, in which they affirmed that the <b>Code</b> <b>contained</b> elements judged opposed to the Koran, to the Sunna and to the Ijma. they were almost all dismissed or forced to retire. Imams delivering speeches opposing the Code and shayks signing petitions or articles criticizing it were arrested. Bourguiba later addressed them in a speech: ...|$|E

The last five concerned advertising copy and prohibited misrepresentation of the film's contents, [...] "salacious copy", and the word [...] "courtesan". Soon, studios found their way around the restrictions and published more racy imagery. Ultimately this backfired in 1934 when a billboard in Philadelphia was placed outside Cardinal Thomas Dougherty's home. Severely offended, Dougherty helped launch the motion picture boycott that later facilitated the enforcement of the code. A commonly repeated theme by those supporting censorship, and one mentioned in the code itself, was the notion that film was a medium that greatly appealed to the masses and thus needed to be regulated.|$|E
