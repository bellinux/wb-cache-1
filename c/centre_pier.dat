5000|$|From The Cornwall Chronicle, April 23, 1870: [...] "The Longford iron bridge {{has been}} {{constructed}} and erected under contract by Mr. C. de Borgue from designs {{prepared by the}} company's engineers, Messrs. Doyne, Major, and Willett. It is on the principle known as the double Warren girder, and consists of two spans, each of 200 ft. The girder is continuous, fixed in the centre but expanding and contracting at both ends, upon an apparatus invented by Mr. Doyne. The girders are of lattice work, formed by building at top and bottom, strings of plate iron 2 ft wide on the bottom, and 2 ft deep. These are connected together by vertical and diagonal bars, the vertical bars being placed 14 ft apart, and the diagonals crossed between these. The size {{of each of these}} bars is arranged according to its position in the bridge, and in exact proportion to the amount of work it is to perform, a much smaller bar being used in tho centre than at the ends of each span. The top and bottom strings, on the contrary are much stronger in the centre than at the ends. The space between the upper and lower strings is 19 ft. The two main girders are connected together by cross girders at every 14 ft, and upon these are rivetted the beams which carry the permanent rails. The cross girders are rivetted to the sides of the lower strings, and the top strings arc connected by strong angle irons, thus giving great stability to the whole structure, which represents, in section, a square of 20 ft. A feature in this Bridge {{is the fact that the}} rivet holes instead of being punched as is the ordinary process, have all been drilled as true as a gun barrel; the consequence being that not a single hole required alteration, even where two or three plates had to be bolted together. The rivets were all made to fit the holes cold, and as they were put in at a red heat, and driven up by means of a circular steel cap, they all fit- as tight as though the holes had been rammed with some soft substance. Hence the extreme rigidity and elasticity of the structure. The ends of the bridge are to be set off by four massive fluted columns of cast iron, having handsome basements, and relieved by ornamental capitals, and over the centre also is a massive ornamental casting, which will agreeably break the line and relieve the appearance of the structure. These are the only pieces of ornamentation in which tho engineers have indulged. The height of the bridge and of the viaduct immediately beyond were both deter mined after a careful survey of the country and the most minute enquiries respecting the various flood levels. The bridge is now 2 feet 6 inch cm clear above the level of the highest recorded flood, and as it offers no impediment whatever to the passage of the waters, it is regarded almost as an everlasting structure. The abutments and <b>centre</b> <b>pier</b> are not yet quite complete, inasmuch as they have to be built up to the sides of the bridge, but the brick work and masonry of which they are composed, is very massive. They are sixteen feet thick, and stand upon a foundation of stiff clay. We are informed that a bed of cement concrete was laid 1 ft thick, upon which the brickwork was commenced. The average depth of the concrete bed from the surface of the ground is 26 feet m, so that the foundations are imbedded 27 ft or more below the river level. The abutments and piers are composed of brick, with ponderous blocks of hard blue stone, dove-tailed together under the girders, with quoins, caps, and copings of freestone quarried in the immediate neighbourhood, of the quality of which the engineers speak very highly. We have referred above to an apparatus invented by Mr. Doyne, the object of which is to supply a means of compensation for the expansion or contraction in tho length of long iron girders, produced by variations of temperature and also to remove the pounding of the girder upon its support, caused by tho uudulatory motion produced in the girder by the passage of a heavy load. This has hitherto been effected by means more or less imperfect, and it is believed that this invention will prove a great improvement upon those which have hitherto been in use. The apparatus consists of a cast-iron circular plate seven feet in diameter and four inches in thickness, which rests on the top of the abutment. From the upper surface of this plate, five vertical ribs or jaws project upwards to the height of one foot nine inches. They are three inches in thickness and ten inches apart, running along the plate, in the direction of the girder, for its whole diameter. The upper edges of these ribs are grooved across the line of the girder, and in these grooves there rests a cast-steel turned pin 5 ftlong, and three inches in diameter. From this pin two steel links depend between each pair of ribs, making eight in number : they are three inches square, and are furnished with eyes at each end three inches in diameter, and bushed with brass. They are 16 inch cm long from centre to centre of the eyes, and hang nearly touching the ribs on one side, and leaving a space of nearly three inches between them on the other. This completes the description of the lower or abutment member of the apparatus. The upper girder member is nearly similar, but inverted; its plate, instead of being circular, is oblong. The ribs are four in number, and project downwards. They are placed between the links with the grooves opposite to the eyes. Through these, and through the eyes, a steel pin similar to the one described passes. Thus, the lower portion of the upper member is suspended from the upper portion of the lower member. The girder rests upon the iron plate, and as it increases or diminishes in length, through changes of temperature, it pushes forward or draws backward the whole upper member, causing it to swing freely on the suspending links, as if it rested on the tray of an ordinary swing. There is also a third motion, which takes place in the girders, which must be provided for in the bearings on the abutments, or serious vibration is produced. It is the undulatory or wave motion, produced by the changing deflections of the girders under the action of a moving load, which causes the ends of the girders to rock on their bearings. This motion is also perfectly provided for by Mr Doyne's apparatus, as the plate, on which the girder rests rolls freely on the lower pin, and thus destroys all pounding action on the abutment plate. It will be seen that when longitudinal expansion or contraction takes place in the girder, the lower pin moves forwards and backwards through the ribs of the lower member, and consequently the holes in these arc so formed as to give free play to this motion; they are of a radial oblong form, which has been termed [...] "balanoidal," [...] or bean-shaped." ...|$|E

40|$|The Netherlands is {{a country}} where people {{have to live with}} water, rather than {{fighting}} against it. This philosophy often requires interaction between infrastructure and waterways, where (hydraulic) structures are placed close to or even extending in the waterway, introducing the risk of ship collision. What makes this accidental load so problematic is the magnitude of these forces, caused by the combination of a very high mass moving with a sizeable velocity. Since structures are often not able to withstand the high impact energy, this requires the design of separate protective structures. This research focusses on the concept of mitigating these damages, limiting the plastic deformation to specific parts of the structure which can easily be replaced. In order to find an answer to the research question, it is important to gain more insight in the problem of ship collision and the solutions that are currently available. This achieved by gathering available data about shipping accidents that happened in the Netherlands, which show that the problem of ship collision is something that has a large impact on the design of structures, and has been for several years. Solving the problem of ship collision starts with a proper determination of the magnitude and the relation between both the collision energy and the forces required to safely disperse it. The methods prescribed by the Eurocode, the CETMEF and the AASHTO are consulted. Finally an overview of the currently available methods was established. At this stage of the research, some proper insight was gained in how the problem of ship collision was handled in the years leading up to this one. By taking {{a closer look at the}} techniques used in other branches, a set of three alternatives was brought up. Before making a selection between the two alternatives, a feasibility study has been executed, validating that the concepts actually worked as expected. A selection between the alternatives was made by a Multi Criteria Analysis, where each of the alternatives was scored on a list of weighed criteria. According to this analysis, the sandwich panels proved to be the better alternative. Since the design has been based solely on assumptions rather than properties of an existing location, a case was introduced. In December of 2016 a ship collided with a section of the weir in Grave, providing for a topical case, hence the design is based on the <b>centre</b> <b>pier</b> of the bridge/weir structure. Based on a combination of the original sketches and a risk analysis carried out a few years ago, it was possible to identify the static loads that act on the <b>centre</b> <b>pier.</b> Minor alterations to the design of the sandwich panels made it possible to fit them to the pier, where the dimensions of the hexagon mesh combined with the properties of the design ship resulted in a value of the resulting collision force on the pier. The high magnitude of the horizontally acting collision force might introduce problems to the stability of the shallow foundation of the structure. The method prescribed by the Eurocode was used to validate the stability of the structure both the current situation and the updated situation where the resulting collision force is acting on the structure. The results of the calculations showed that the structure proved to be stable under each of the checked loading situations. Validation of the stability was the final step of this thesis research. Future research is required to optimise the design and properly model the problem, but the resulting design is a strong starting point for this design problem.

60|$|Then {{the troubled}} beating of the gong carried {{the order to}} take up {{everything}} and bear it beyond high-water mark, and the flare-lamps broke out by the hundred between the webs of dull iron as the riveters began a night's work, racing against the flood that was to come. The girders of the three <b>centre</b> <b>piers</b> - those that stood on the cribs -were all but in position. They needed just as many rivets as could be driven into them, for the flood would assuredly wash out their supports, and the ironwork would settle down on the caps of stone {{if they were not}} blocked at the ends. A hundred crowbars strained at the sleepers of the temporary line that fed the unfinished piers. It was heaved up in lengths, loaded into trucks, and backed up the bank beyond flood-level by the groaning locomotives. The tool-sheds on the sands melted away before the attack of shouting armies, and with them went the stacked ranks of Government stores, iron-hound boxes of rivets, pliers, cutters, duplicate parts of the riveting-machines, spare pumps and chains. The big crane would be the last to be shifted, for she was hoisting all the heavy stuff up to the main structure of the bridge. The concrete blocks on the fleet of stone-boats were dropped overside, where there was any depth of water, to guard the piers, and the empty boats themselves were poled under the bridge down-stream. It was here that Peroo's pipe shrilled loudest, for the first stroke of the big gong had brought the dinghy back at racing speed, and Peroo and his people were stripped to the waist, working for the honour and credit which are better than life.|$|R
