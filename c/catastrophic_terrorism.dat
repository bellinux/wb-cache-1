The United States might respond with draconian measures scaling back civil liberties, allowing wider surveillance of citizens, detention of suspects and use of deadly force. More violence could follow, either future terrorist attacks or U.S. counterattacks. Belatedly, Americans would judge their leaders negligent for not addressing terrorism more urgently." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role that}} insurance has played in dealing with terrorism before and after September 11, 2001, {{by focusing on the}} distinctive challenges associated with <b>terrorism</b> as a <b>catastrophic</b> risk. The <b>Terrorism</b> Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) was passed by the U. S. Congress in November 2002, establishing a national terrorism insurance program that provides up to $ 100 billion commercial coverage with a specific but temporary risk-sharing arrangement between the federal government and insurers. TRIA's three-year term ends December 31, 2005, so Congress soon has to determine whether it should be renewed, whether an alternative terrorism insurance program should be substituted for it, or whether insurance coverage is left solely {{in the hands of the}} private sector. As input into this process, the paper examines several alternatives and scenarios, and discusses their potential to create a sustainable terrorism insurance program in the Unites States. ...|$|R
40|$|CHDS State/LocalThe {{analysis}} of domestic incidents of terrorism has revealed many gaps in our Nation's capability to effectively manage the multi-jurisdictional response. Although many gaps {{have been addressed}} through implementation of measures based on lessons learned, the most pervasive unresolved issue remains the ability to properly identify first response personnel on incident scenes. The nature of incidents of terrorism requires force protection to be a priority because {{of the threat of}} a secondary attack. Identity must be established and authenticated to protect responders and prevent infiltration to perpetrate a secondary attack. This thesis examines and evaluates several options for closing this pervasive identity management capability gap. The current decentralized identity system, a defined and typed response resource for identity management, and the federal identity project initiated under HSPD- 12 are examined and evaluated as mechanisms for improving on-scene identity management in the response to incidents of terrorism. The thesis argues the development of a standardized nationwide responder identity token that can be rapidly authenticated and establishing dedicated identity management response resources are essential to improving the response multi-jurisdictional and <b>catastrophic</b> incidents of <b>terrorism.</b> Corporal, Frederick County Sheriff’s Office, Frederick, Marylan...|$|R

Several insurance programs in the United States and other countries ensure that insurance will be available to cover risks that the private sector has been unable or unwilling to cover, including losses from <b>catastrophic</b> events and <b>terrorism.</b> For government insurance programs, the question of long-term cost and program funding needs to be addressed before any program is established.

The latter question addresses the issue of whether postponing a risk mitigating decision is an optimal strategy or not. Accordingly we develop and estimate both a one-period model and a multi-period model within the framework of Extreme Value Theory (EVT).

40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} sources of <b>catastrophic</b> risk are <b>terrorism</b> and climate change. The United States has responded aggressively to the risk of terrorism while doing very little about the risk of climate change. For the United States alone, the cost of the Iraq War is in excess of the anticipated cost of the Kyoto Protocol. The divergence presents a puzzle; it also raises more general questions about both risk perception and the public demand for legislation. The best explanation for the divergence emphasizes bounded rationality. Americans believe that aggressive steps {{to reduce the risk of}} terrorism promise to deliver significant benefits in the near future at acceptable cost. By contrast, they believe that aggressive steps to reduce the risk of climate change will not greatly benefit American citizens in the near future and they are not willing to pay a great deal to reduce that risk. This intuitive form of cost-benefit analysis is greatly influenced by behavioral factors, including the availability heuristic, probability neglect, outrage, and myopia. All of these contribute, after 9 / 11, to a willingness to support significant steps to respond to terrorism and to relative indifference to climate change. It follows that Americans are likely to support significant steps in response to climate change only f one of two conditions is met: the costs of those steps are perceived to be acceptably low; or new information, perhaps including a salient incident, indicates that Americans have much to gain from risk reduction in the relatively near future...|$|R

40|$|Do {{the laws}} of war govern the September 11 attacks? Did the attacks {{constitute}} 2 ̆ 2 war crimes 2 ̆ 2 ? These questions are difficult because they touch upon complex legal problems involving deep conceptual ambiguities in international humanitarian law. It is unclear under what conditions {{the laws of}} war apply. This ambiguity arises from the combination of two related developments in {{the laws of war}}: (1) The laws of war now govern de facto as well as de jure warfare; and (2) the laws of war now govern internal as well as international armed conflict. The central difficulty is how best to define the scope and content of international humanitarian rules applicable in non-international armed conflict. This Article argues that the September 11 attacks violated the Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions; and that this determination has important consequences for both US. anti-terrorism policy and international humanitarian law. Careful scrutiny of the treaty text, structure, and history of the potentially applicable laws of war strongly supports the conclusion that the terrorist attacks of September 11 constituted the initiation or confirmation of an 2 ̆ 2 armed conflict 2 ̆ 2 within the meaning of international law; and that the attacks were 2 ̆ 2 war crimes. 2 ̆ 2 The dual concerns that animate the scope and content of Common Article 3 -humanitarian protection and state sovereignty-are best served by this reading of 2 ̆ 2 armed conflicts not of an international character. 2 ̆ 2 The laws of war offer a proven, durable mode of imposing principled constraints on organized violence.

40|$|Introduction]. Europe {{has long}} had {{a pivotal role in}} American foreign policy. The <b>catastrophic</b> <b>terrorism</b> that came to America on that sunny Tuesday morning in September 2001 is {{unlikely}} to change this. Transatlantic relations will remain at the core of world order, even as the American giant concentrates its might on the prevention of another September 11 th. Pursuing the perpetrators of that dark deed, and more importantly, thwarting those who would do so again, will top the American political agenda {{for a long time to}} come. An unusual mood of determination has settled across the land; nine months on, the flags still fly; the public still gives the President unprecedented support in his "war on terror. " This is an American public that sees the biggest challenges in the war as yet to come. It is a people ostensibly ready to do battle with Iraq. It is an America that sees the challenge of terrorism as long-term and complex. Domestic and foreign policies alike have been infused with a new urgency: concentrating the capacities of the shaken nation on warding off the next attack. If others, if Europe, can help in this quest, so much the better. America’s new determination does not mean America is uninterested in partners. It does mean America is more serious about foreign policy than it has been in a long time. Americans will want to cooperate with partners in Europe and elsewhere — where possible — but Americans will also condone acting alone when necessary. Americans, especially within the broad and diverse foreign policy community, have long debated how much "multilateralism" is possible, how much "unilateralism" is necessary. Operationalized, the abstract opposites "multi" or "uni" most frequently refer to cooperation between the United States of America and the less than united states of Europe. The United States is a global power; all the same, when it talks about international cooperation, it is almost always also talking about cooperation with Europe. This debate over the value of the transatlantic partnership will go on, in a changed context certainly, but by no means bereft of the many underlying continuities that have come to constitute relations across the Atlantic. U. S. perspectives on Europe’s role in the unfolding war against terrorism must thus be seen in the shadow of this larger, older discourse...|$|E
40|$|Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD- 5 {{requires}} {{all federal}} departments and agencies {{to adopt a}} National Incident Management System (NIMS) /Incident Command System (ICS) and use it in their individual domestic incident management and emergency prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation programs and activities, {{as well as in}} support of those actions taken to assist state and local entities. This system provides a consistent nationwide template to enable federal, state, local, and tribal governments, private-sector, and nongovernmental organizations to work together effectively and efficiently to prepare for, prevent, respond to, and recover from domestic incidents, regardless of cause, size, or complexity, including acts of <b>catastrophic</b> <b>terrorism.</b> This document identifies the operational concepts of the Federal Radiological Monitoring and Assessment Center's (FRMAC) implementation of the NIMS/ICS response structure under the National Response Plan (NRP). The construct identified here defines the basic response template to be tailored to the incident-specific response requirements. FRMAC's mission to facilitate interagency environmental data management, monitoring, sampling, analysis, and assessment and link this information to the planning and decision staff clearly places the FRMAC in the Planning Section. FRMAC is not a mitigating resource for radiological contamination but is present to conduct radiological impact assessment for public dose avoidance. Field monitoring is a fact-finding mission to support this effort directly. Decisions based on the assessed data will drive public protection and operational requirements. This organizational structure under NIMS is focused by the mission responsibilities and interface requirements following the premise to provide emergency responders with a flexible yet standardized structure for incident response activities. The coordination responsibilities outlined in the NRP are based on the NIMS/ICS construct and Unified Command (UC) for management of a domestic incident. The NRP Nuclear/Radiological Incident Annex (NUC) further provides requirements and protocols for coordinating federal government capabilities to respond to nuclear/radiological Incidents of National Significance (INS) and other radiological incidents. When a FRMAC is established, it operates under the parameters of NIMS as defined in the NRP. FRMAC and its operations have been modified to reflect NIMS/ICS concepts and principles and to facilitate working in a Unified Command structure. FRMAC is established at or near the scene of the incident to coordinate radiological monitoring and assessment and is established in coordination with the U. S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS); the coordinating agency; other federal agencies; and state, local, and tribal authorities. However, regardless of the coordinating agency designation, U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) coordinates radiological monitoring and assessment activities for the initial phases of the offsite federal incident response through the Radiological Assistance Program (RAP) and FRMAC assets. Monitoring and assessment data are managed by FRMAC in an accountable, secure, and retrievable format. Monitoring data interpretations, including exposure rate contours, dose projections, and any requested radiological assessments are to be provided to the DHS; to the coordinating agency; and to state, local, and tribal government agencies...|$|E
40|$|Preventing and {{protecting}} against <b>catastrophic</b> <b>terrorism</b> {{is a complex}} and dynamic challenge. Small groups or individuals can use advanced technology to cause massive destruction, and the rapid pace of technology and ease of information dissemination continually gives terrorists new tools. A 100 % defense is not possible. It's a numbers problem [...] there are simply too many possible targets to protect and too many potential attack scenarios and adversaries to defend against. However, science and technology (S&T) is a powerful force multiplier for defense. We must use S&T {{to get ahead of}} the game by making terrorist attacks more difficult to execute, more likely to be interdicted, and less devastating in terms of casualties, economic damage, or lasting disruption. Several S&T areas have potential to significantly enhance homeland security efforts with regard to detecting radiation, pathogens, explosives, and chemical signatures of weapons activities. All of these areas require interdisciplinary research and development (R&D), and many critically depend on advances in materials science. For example, the science of nuclear signatures lies at the core of efforts to develop enhanced radiation detection and nuclear attribution capabilities. Current radiation detectors require cryogenic cooling and are too bulky and expensive. Novel signatures of nuclear decay, new detector materials that provide high resolution at ambient temperatures, and new imaging detectors are needed. Such technologies will improve our ability to detect and locate small, distant, or moving sources and to discriminate threat materials from legitimate sources. A more complete understanding of isotopic ratios via secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), NanoSIMS, or yet-to-be-developed technologies is required to elucidate critical characteristics of nuclear materials (e. g., isotopics, age, reprocessing) in order to identify their source and route history. S&T challenges abound in the biodefense arena as well. Improved biodetectors are needed [...] autonomous instruments that continuously monitor the environment for threat pathogens, promptly alert authorities {{in the event of a}} positive detection, and have an extremely low false alarm rate. Because many threat pathogens are endemic to various regions of the world, the natural microbial environment must be characterized so that background detections can be distinguished from a deliberate release. In addition, most current detection approaches require an a priori knowledge of the pathogens of concern and thus won't work in the face of a new, naturally occurring disease, such as a mutated avian influenza that effects humans, or a deliberately manipulated organism. Thus, we must move from species-specific detection to function-based detection based on a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms and genetic markers of infectivity, pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance, and other traits that distinguish a harmful organism from an innocuous one. Last but not least, new vaccines and treatments are needed, which in turn require in-depth understanding of cellular surfaces, protein folding, and myriad nano-bio aspects of host-pathogen interactions. Much attention is being devoted to countering weapons-of-mass-destruction terrorism, since Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups have repeatedly stated their intention to acquire and use nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. However, terrorists in Iraq and elsewhere continue to wreak havoc using improvised explosive devices. Thus, there is a pressing security need for better methods for detecting explosive materials and devices. Transformational S&T such as pulsed fast-neutron analysis or terahertz spectroscopy for material- and element-specific imaging offer the promise of greatly improved explosive detection. For bioscience-based approaches, the development of highly multiplexed transducer arrays and molecular recognition methods that mimic biological systems would similarly provide the foundation for vastly improved capabilities. Likewise, new materials and technologies are needed for the detection of chemical signatures of weapons activities. One grand challenge is the detection and characterization of chemical effluents indicative of weapons production, either biological, chemical, or nuclear. Ideally, one would like to be able to detect such chemical signatures remotely, via satellite or other high-altitude platform. To do so, one must know what chemicals, singly or in combination, would be produced in various production processes, how they would behave in the environment, and how those chemicals, their precursors, and degradation products could be sampled...|$|E
