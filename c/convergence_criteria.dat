5|$|Following the U.S. {{financial}} crisis in 2008, {{fears of a}} sovereign debt crisis developed in 2009 among investors concerning some European states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in early 2010. Greece was most acutely affected, but fellow Eurozone members Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were also significantly affected. To {{be included in the}} eurozone, countries had to fulfil certain <b>convergence</b> <b>criteria,</b> but the meaningfulness of such criteria was diminished by the fact it was not enforced with the same level of strictness among countries.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU {{member states}} to adopt the euro upon meeting certain {{monetary}} and budgetary <b>convergence</b> <b>criteria,</b> although not all states have done so. The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions, while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course.|$|E
5|$|In February 1992, European Union {{countries}} {{signed the}} Maastricht Treaty which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first stage centered on liberalizing capital mobility and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries. The second stage established the European Monetary Institute which was ultimately dissolved {{in tandem with}} the establishment in 1998 of the European Central Bank (ECB) and European System of Central Banks. Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of <b>convergence</b> <b>criteria</b> that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. The third and final stage introduced a common currency for circulation known as the Euro, adopted by eleven of then-fifteen members of the European Union in January 1999. In doing so, they disaggregated their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy. These countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders, exchangeable for euros at fixed rates, until 2002 when the ECB began issuing official Euro coins and notes. , the EMU comprises 17 nations which have issued the Euro, and 11 non-Euro states.|$|E

25|$|In 1998 eleven {{member states}} of the European Union had met the euro <b>convergence</b> <b>criteria,</b> and the eurozone came into {{existence}} with the official launch of the euro (alongside national currencies) on 1 January 1999. Greece qualified in 2000 and was admitted on 1 January 2001 before physical notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002 replacing all national currencies. Between 2007 and 2015, seven new states acceded.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of a European single currency became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969. In 1992, having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union, the member states signed the Maastricht Treaty and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed-on rules including the <b>convergence</b> <b>criteria</b> {{if they wanted to}} join the monetary union. The states wanting to participate had first to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Determining when a {{numerical}} simulation is fully converged {{is important in}} getting accurate and reliable results. In this study a new <b>convergence</b> <b>criterion</b> based on extracting the energetic modes of {{a numerical}} solution, based on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition method, is suggested. The POD <b>convergence</b> <b>criterion</b> is tested and applied to flow over a bluff body which has been solved numerically. The higher the mode number, the longer it takes to converge. The {{results show that the}} singular values alone can be used to judge convergence based on POD numerical simulations. Also, the suggested POD <b>convergence</b> <b>criterion</b> can be applied successfully and easily to numerical simulations...|$|R

In 2011, polls showed narrow opposition to the currency. On 23 July 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a decision allowing Lithuania to adopt the euro as its currency on 1 January 2015. Litas and euro were both legal tender in Lithuania until 16 January 2015.|$|E

In all of the three latest annual assessment reports, Bulgaria managed to comply with four out of the five economic <b>convergence</b> <b>criteria</b> for euro adoption, only failing to comply with the criteria requiring the currency of the state to have been a stable ERM-II member for a minimum of two years.|$|E

Although a September 2000 referendum rejected adopting the euro, the country follows the policies {{set forth in}} the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union and meets the economic <b>convergence</b> <b>criteria</b> needed to adopt the euro. The majority of the political parties in the Folketing support adopting the euro, but as yet a new referendum has not been held, despite plans; scepticism of the EU among Danish voters has historically been strong.|$|E

25|$|According to the 1995 {{accession}} treaty, Sweden {{is required}} to join the eurozone and therefore must convert to the euro once the <b>convergence</b> <b>criteria</b> are met. Notwithstanding this, on 14 September 2003, a consultative Swedish referendum was held on the euro, in which 56% of voters were opposed {{to the adoption of}} the currency, out of an overall turnout of 82.6%. The Swedish government has argued such a course of action is possible since one of the requirements for eurozone membership is a prior two-year membership of the ERM II. By simply not joining the exchange rate mechanism, the Swedish government is provided a formal loophole avoiding the theoretical requirement of adopting the euro.|$|E
25|$|The SGP was {{initially}} proposed by German finance minister Theo Waigel in the mid-1990s. Germany had long maintained a low-inflation policy, {{which had been}} {{an important part of}} the German economy's strong performance since the 1950s. The German government hoped to ensure the continuation of that policy through the SGP, which would ensure the prevalence of fiscal responsibility, and limit the ability of governments to exert inflationary pressures on the European economy. As such, it was also described to be a key tool for the Member States adopting the euro, to ensure that they did not only meet the Maastricht <b>convergence</b> <b>criteria</b> at the time of adopting the euro, but kept on to comply with the fiscal criteria for the following years.|$|E
25|$|According to the Erste Group Bank, {{it would}} be very {{difficult}} for Romania to meet this 2019 target, not in regards of complying with the five nominal <b>convergence</b> <b>criteria</b> values, but in regards of reaching some appropriate levels of real convergence (i.e. raising the GDP per capita from 50% to a level above 60% of the EU average) ahead of the euro adoption. The Romanian Central Bank governor, Mugur Isărescu, admitted the target was ambitious, but obtainable if the political parties passed a legal roadmap for the required reforms to be implemented, and clarified this roadmap should lead to Romania entering ERM-2 only on 1 January 2017 so the euro could be adopted after two years of ERM-2 membership on 1 January 2019. In April 2015, Isărescu stated that the technical requirement for adoption of the euro 1 January 2019 would imply joining ERM-2 at the latest in the first half of 2016. Ahead of ERM-2 entry, Isărescu argued, Romania needs to conduct monetary adjustments in form of finalizing the process of bringing minimum reserve requirement ratios in line with eurozone levels (a process envisaged to last between 1-1½ year) and to complete major economic policy adjustments: 1) Removing the sources of repressed inflation (i.e. completion of the energy market deregulation), 2) Removing sources of quasi-fiscal deficits (by restructuring loss-making state-owned enterprises), 3) Removing other sources of future budgetary pressures (i.e. the unavoidable expenditures to modernise road infrastructure).|$|E

500|$|The EU {{treaties}} contain {{so called}} <b>convergence</b> <b>criteria,</b> {{specified in the}} protocols of the Treaties of the European Union. As regards government finance, the states agreed that the annual government budget deficit should not exceed 3% {{of gross domestic product}} (GDP) and that the gross government debt to GDP should not exceed 60% of GDP (see [...] ). For eurozone members there is the Stability and Growth Pact, which contains the same requirements for budget deficit and debt limitation but with a much stricter regime. In the past, many European countries have substantially exceeded these criteria {{over a long period of}} time. Around 2005 most eurozone members violated the pact, resulting in no action taken against violators.|$|E
2500|$|Since the <b>convergence</b> <b>criteria</b> require {{participation}} in the ERM, and non-eurozone states are responsible for deciding when to join ERM, they can ultimately control when they adopt the euro by staying outside the ERM and thus deliberately failing to meet the <b>convergence</b> <b>criteria</b> until they wish to. [...] In some non-eurozone states without an opt-out, there has been discussion about holding referendums on approving their euro adoption. [...] Of the 16 states which have acceded to EU since 1992, the only state to have staged a euro referendum to date is Sweden, which in 2003 rejected its government's proposal to adopt the euro in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009 {{the authors}} of a {{confidential}} International Monetary Fund (IMF) report suggested that {{in light of the}} ongoing global financial crisis, the EU Council should consider granting EU member states which are having difficulty complying with all five <b>convergence</b> <b>criteria</b> the option to [...] "partially adopt" [...] the euro, {{along the lines of the}} monetary agreements signed with the microstates outside the EU. These states would gain the right to adopt the euro and issue a national variant of euro coins, but would not get a seat in ECB or the Eurogroup until they met all the <b>convergence</b> <b>criteria.</b> However, the EU has not made use of this alternative accession process.|$|E

40|$|Currently, only {{computationally}} complex, probabilistic {{models for}} convergence exist for self-organizing maps (SOMs). The complexity of these algorithms {{seems to take}} away from the simple intuitive nature of SOMs in addition to making them computationally unwieldy. The hypothesis proposed is that the basic SOM algorithm is heuristic in nature and will almost always converge on a set of code vectors (or neurons) which reflect the underlying distribution from which the original sample (or training) vectors were drawn. This study shows that this hypothesis is valid for the basic SOM algorithm by imposing a <b>convergence</b> <b>criterion</b> on the basic SOM algorithm. The <b>convergence</b> <b>criterion</b> (or <b>convergence</b> measure) imposed treats the SOM as a conventional two sample test (i. e. one sample being the training data and one sample being the code vectors). If the hypothesis holds, then imposing a population based <b>convergence</b> <b>criterion</b> on SOMs will increase their accuracy and utility by allowing an end user of the maps to differentiate between “good ” maps (which converged well) and “bad ” maps (which did not converge well), hence allowing only the best maps to be selected for use.
