The enzyme {{was active in}} the 40 to 80 % ammonium sulfate precipitate of whole leaf homogenates and catalyzed the synthesis of acetoacetyl-acyl carrier protein. This condensation reaction was five-fold faster than acetyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein transacylase, and the initial rates of acyl-acyl carrier protein synthesis were independent of the presence of cerulenin. In the presence of fatty acid synthase cofactors and 100 micromolar cerulenin, the principal fatty acid product of de novo synthesis was butyric and hexanoic acids.

50|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the first}} step in the Hofmann-Löffler-Freytag reaction conducted in acidic medium is the protonation of the N-halogenated amine 21 to form the corresponding N-halogenated ammonium salt 22. In case of thermal or chemical initiation of the free radical chain reaction, the N-halogenated ammonium salt 22 undergoes homolytic cleavage of the nitrogen-halogen bond to generate the nitrogen-centered radical cation 23. In contrast, it has been argued that the UV light-catalyzed initiation involves the free form of the N-haloamine and a rapid protonation of the newly generated neutral nitrogen radical (see the section devoted to mechanistic studies for arguments supporting this statement). Intramolecular 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer produces carbon-centered radical 24, which subsequently abstracts a halogen atom from the N-halogenated ammonium salt 22. This affords the protonated δ-halogenated amine 25 and regenerates the nitrogen-centered radical cation 23, the <b>chain</b> <b>carrier</b> of the reaction. Upon treatment with base, 25 undergoes deprotonation followed by an intramolecular SN2 reaction to yield pyrrolidine 28 via intermediate 27.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{destruction}} of stockpiles or unexploded ammunitions of bis(2 -chloroethyl) sulfide, also called mustard gas or yperite, by thermal treatments requires {{the development of}} highly safe processes. The high-level of toxicity of this compound induces {{a high level of}} complexity for any experiments. Consequently, there is a considerable lack of knowledge on the behavior of this chemical under high-temperature conditions (with or without oxygen). In this work a detailed chemical kinetic model for the combustion and pyrolysis of mustard gas is proposed for the first time. A large number of thermo-kinetic parameters were calculated using quantum chemistry and reaction rate theory. The model was validated against experimental pyrolysis data of the literature. It was shown that the degradation of mustard gas is ruled by a chain reaction mechanism where the chlorine atom is the principal <b>chain</b> <b>carrier.</b> HS radical, formed in the primary mechanism by an original pathway found using quantum calculations, was also proved to be an important <b>chain</b> <b>carrier.</b> Comparison with the kinetics of the usual simulant of mustard gas, diethyl sulfide, showed that the lack of chlorine atom in the former chemical leads to an inappropriate simulation of the mustard gas behavior.

However, in the main stage of volatilisation (from 10 - 20 to 70 % weight loss) both polymers liberate the same volatile products through the same basic mechanism of depolymerisation. Nevertheless, the overall rate of volatilisation of TPPS polymers in this stage is much lower than that of PS.

The importance {{of the structure of the}} aluminum additives and of the ratio [Al]/[Li] on both the formation of 'ate' complexes, the retardation effect and the reactivity profile of the polymerization are investigated by UV-visible spectroscopy and polymerization studies. The presence of bulky alkyl groups and/or alkoxide ligands onto aluminum allows the retarded polymerization to proceed for [Al]/[Li] ratios higher than one. Some of these systems offers a broad polymerization window in which the rate of polymerization is strongly reduced and remains almost constant over a large range of [Al]/[Li] ratios.

This analysis discloses the rich kinetic behavior expected for this system, in which the “branching” reaction (H + O_ 2 → OH + O) produces an inert radical toward the reactant.
