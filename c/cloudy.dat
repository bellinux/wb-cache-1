5|$|Despite heavy fishing {{pressure}} {{within its}} range, the <b>cloudy</b> catshark remains common, {{perhaps because it}} may be more biologically productive than most other sharks. As a result, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). <b>Cloudy</b> catsharks from a number of locations off Japan {{have been found to be}} contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDEs), which they acquire from their food. One likely source of these pollutants is the use of the pesticide DDT by developing nations in southern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the <b>cloudy</b> {{catshark}} adapts well to captivity and has {{reproduced in}} the aquarium. It {{is often used}} as a model organism in physiology research. On September 25, 1995, Masuda Motoyashi and colleagues used this species to perform the first successful artificial insemination of a shark or ray. The <b>cloudy</b> catshark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries with bottom fishing nets including trawls and gillnets, {{as well as on}} bottom longlines. Captured individuals are typically discarded, possibly with a high survival rate due to their hardiness. Some 40% of the fish discarded in Yamaguchi Prefecture fisheries are of this species. The bottom trawl fishery operating off Fukushima Prefecture may catch over a ton of <b>cloudy</b> catsharks annually, which are also discarded.|$|E
50|$|Cloud cover varies {{throughout}} the province, ranging {{from more than}} 60% in the Andean region to about 40% in the coastal areas. The central plateaus have intermediate amounts of cloud cover between these 2 regions. As such, the Andean region is more <b>cloudier</b> {{than the rest of}} the province. Sunshine ranges from 10-11 hours of sunshine/day in January to about 5 hours of sunshine/day (less <b>cloudier</b> areas) to less than 3 hours of sunshine/day (more <b>cloudier</b> areas) in July.|$|R

50|$|Cloud {{cover in}} the {{province}} varies widely with the eastern parts receiving less cloud cover than the Andean region which tends to be <b>cloudier.</b> Winters tend to be <b>cloudier</b> than summers with mean daily sunshine hours ranging {{from a high of}} 11 hours/day in January to a low of 3 hours in June.|$|R
5|$|Butterflies {{navigate}} using a time-compensated sun compass. They can see {{polarized light}} and therefore orient even in <b>cloudy</b> conditions. The polarized light near the ultraviolet spectrum {{appears to be}} particularly important. Many migratory butterflies live in semi-arid areas where breeding seasons are short. The life histories of their host plants also influence butterfly behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Denver {{lies within}} the semi-arid, {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification BSk). It has four distinct seasons and receives a modest {{amount of precipitation}} spread throughout the year. Due to its inland location on the High Plains, {{at the foot of}} the Rocky Mountains, Denver, like all cities along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains, is subject to sudden changes in weather. Contrary to the popular belief that Denver receives 300 days of sunshine a year, the city can actually expect to receive an average of 115 clear days, 130 partly <b>cloudy</b> days, and 120 <b>cloudy</b> days each year.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are capable}} of killing humans. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near <b>cloudy</b> waters. American alligators are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. American alligator bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection.|$|E
5|$|For pilots, {{knowledge}} of the sky cover helps determine if visual flight rules (VFR) are being met. Knowing the degree of cloud cover can help {{determine whether or not}} various weather fronts, such as cold fronts or warm fronts, have passed by a location. A nephanalysis, contouring areas that are <b>cloudy</b> with scalloped lines, can be performed to indicate a system's cloud and precipitation pattern. This technique is rarely performed nowadays, due to the prevalence of satellite imagery worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Karl von Frisch (1886–1982) {{studied the}} European honey bee, demonstrating that bees can {{recognize}} a desired compass direction {{in three different}} ways: by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth’s magnetic field. He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under <b>cloudy</b> skies or inside a dark beehive.|$|E
50|$|Precipitation in {{the region}} ranges from 1000 to 1400 mm, with two peaks in late spring / early summer, and late summer / early fall, and a drier, yet <b>cloudier</b> winter.|$|R

5|$|Many {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed for animal navigation: there is evidence {{for a number of}} them. Investigators have often been forced to discard the simplest hypotheses - for example, some animals can navigate on a dark and <b>cloudy</b> night, when neither landmarks nor celestial cues like sun, moon, or stars are visible. The major mechanisms known or hypothesized are described in turn below.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, <b>cloudy</b> weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are <b>cloudy</b> while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. These warm air masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when {{they come from the}} north or northwest {{as a result of a}} trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, warm air masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air. These warm air masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the warmest air masses, leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.|$|E
5|$|Since Darwin's On the Origins of Certain Instincts (quoted above) in 1873, path {{integration}} {{has been}} shown to be important to navigation in animals including ants, rodents and birds. When vision (and hence the use of remembered landmarks) is not available, such as when animals are navigating on a <b>cloudy</b> night, in the open ocean, or in relatively featureless areas such as sandy deserts, path integration must rely on idiothetic cues from within the body.|$|E

25|$|The {{climate of}} Pelotas is humid {{subtropical}} or temperate (Cfa), very homogeneous to Sydney, Australia (albeit <b>cloudier).</b> Summers are warm with regular rainfall. Winters are cool with relatively frequent frosts (about 24 per year) and fog.|$|R
5|$|Some brewers add {{one or more}} {{clarifying}} {{agents to}} beer, which typically precipitate (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product. This process makes the beer appear bright and clean, rather than the <b>cloudy</b> appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers.|$|E
5|$|The {{cloud cover}} {{is such that}} typical surface light levels are similar to a partly <b>cloudy</b> day on Earth, around 5000–10000 lux. The {{equivalent}} visibility is about three kilometers, but this will likely vary with the wind conditions. Little to no solar energy could conceivably be collected by solar panels on a surface probe. In fact, due to the thick, highly reflective cloud cover, the total solar energy received by {{the surface of the}} planet is less than that of the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cloudy</b> {{outer edge}} of the eye is called the “eyewall”. The eyewall {{typically}} expands outward with height, resembling an arena football stadium; this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the stadium effect. The eyewall is where the greatest wind speeds are found, air rises most rapidly, clouds reach to their highest altitude, and precipitation is the heaviest. The heaviest wind damage occurs where a tropical cyclone's eyewall passes over land.|$|E
50|$|There is a National Weather Service (NWS) office (which sends up {{radiosonde}} balloons twice a day) colocated {{with the}} FAA Flight Service Station at the airport. The NWS ranks Cold Bay as the <b>cloudiest</b> {{city in the}} United States.|$|R
