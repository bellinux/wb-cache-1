5|$|The {{airfield}} {{served as}} an alternative destination for Imperial Airways when Croydon was fogbound. The runway was {{just long enough for}} this purpose. Using Penshurst as an alternate destination caused delays to the passengers as there were no <b>Customs</b> <b>facilities.</b> On 18 February 1932, both Croydon and Penshurst were fogbound, and Handley Page H.P.45 G-AAXE Hengist diverted to Heston Aerodrome. As <b>Customs</b> <b>facilities</b> existed there, passengers were on their way in 10 minutes, as opposed to the three hour or longer delay when using Penshurst. The practice of having a Customs Officer attend Penshurst on a daily basis was instigated, but it was discontinued in February 1935. On 24 October 1932, a German and a French airliner diverted to Penshurst due to smog over London.|$|E
5|$|Lympne Airport , was a {{military}} and later civil airfield , at Lympne, Kent, United Kingdom, which operated from 1916 to 1984. During the First World War RFC Lympne was originally an acceptance point for aircraft being delivered to, and returning from, France but was later designated as a First Class Landing Ground, RAF Lympne. It became a civil airfield in 1919 and saw the operation of early air mail services after the 1918 armistice. It {{was one of the}} first four airfields in the United Kingdom with <b>customs</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|E
5|$|I-87 takes a northerly track from US11, {{crossing}} the Great Chazy River and briefly entering the village limits, where it runs past {{a series of}} homes and businesses built up along nearby US9. As both roads head north out of the village, US9 connects to the Northway one last time at exit43, the last interchange on I-87 before the Canadian border. Past the exit, the highway doubles in width, becoming eight lanes wide as it begins to run past the <b>customs</b> <b>facilities</b> on the American side of the border. The Northway and I-87 end shortly thereafter at the Canadian border, where the highway continues past the Champlain-St. Bernard de Lacolle Border Crossing into Quebec as A-15.|$|E

The 2009-2011 terminal renovation did not include a <b>customs</b> <b>facility,</b> nor did US Customs & Border Protection open an office at the airport until 2014. However, construction is now underway for a passenger <b>customs</b> <b>facility</b> that will be linked to Gate A9 via a walkway. This facility is scheduled to open in 2016.|$|R

25|$|In 1846 another Act of Parliament {{established}} the Great Western Dock Company to provide full facilities for shipping at Millbay. Gill sold his Millbay Pier to this company {{and became a}} director. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was engaged to design new docks; both he and Gill {{were involved in the}} South Devon Railway, so {{it is no surprise that}} the first railway station in Plymouth was opened nearby in 1849.

25|$|Level 1 of the {{terminal}} contains baggage carousels and ground transportation access. Level 2 contains ticketing/check-in, shopping and dining, {{and access to the}} concourses. The airport currently has two immigration and <b>customs</b> <b>facilities</b> (FIS), located in Concourse D, Level 3 and in Concourse J, Level 3. The Concourse D FIS can be utilized by flights arriving at all gates in Concourse E and all gates in Concourses D and some gates in Concourse F. The Concourse J FIS can be utilized by flights arriving at all gates in Concourse J and most gates in Concourse H. However, all gates in Concourse G and some gates in Concourses F and H, do not have the facilities to route passengers to any FIS, and therefore can only be used for domestic arrivals. MIA is unique among American airports in that all of its facilities are common-use, meaning that they are assigned by the airport and no one airline holds ownership or leases on any terminal space or gates, thus giving the airport much more flexibility in terminal and gate assignments and allowing it to make full use of existing facilities. The entire airport became common-use by the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|The North Sea Aerial and General Transport Co. used a Blackburn Kangaroo on its {{short-lived}} Leeds-Lympne-Amsterdam {{service from}} 6 March 1920. The <b>customs</b> <b>facilities</b> at New Holland had been withdrawn on 28 January, necessitating the roundabout route. It was {{estimated that the}} extra costs involved in taking this route amounted to one-third of the total costs. Flight called for <b>customs</b> <b>facilities</b> to be established to enable direct flights to be made from the north of England to the continent. Starting from 2 August, hourly weather forecasts were broadcast from Lympne and other airfields. A system of ground signals advising pilots of the weather conditions at Biggin Hill and Croydon was also introduced about this time. During August, Aircraft Transport and Travel took over air mail flights, using DH.9A aircraft. In November a Notice to Airmen was released announcing that searchlights would be in use at Lympne for two hours after sunset to assist pilots in landing their aircraft. Arrangements could be made in advance for this facility to be made available after the notified hours. In December, {{it was announced that}} an [...] "aerial lighthouse" [...] was to be installed at Lympne as the one installed at Croydon had proved to be of benefit to pilots arriving after dark.|$|E
500|$|The {{canal and}} docks opened on 20 July 1826. A barge lock, [...] and a ship lock, , {{capable of taking}} vessels up to 400 tons, {{connected}} the extensive docks to the Ouse.

Goole became an official port in 1827, when it gained its own <b>Customs</b> <b>facilities.</b> The scheme had cost £361,484, of which £221,350 had been borrowed, while the rest came from company resources.|$|E

500|$|The airline was due {{to begin}} flights on 20 April 2009 to Bagdogra Airport in India, but had to delay the inaugural flight [...] {{due to the lack}} of {{immigration}} and <b>customs</b> <b>facilities</b> at the airport. The inaugural flight to Bagdogra Airport left Paro Airport on 18 June 2009, making Drukair the first international airline to operate into the airport. In Bagdogra, a ceremony was held which was attended by S. M. Krishna, the Indian Minister for External Affairs, and Lyonpo Ugyen Tshering, the Bhutanese Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
500|$|Deutsche Gold- und Silber-Scheideanstalt (German Gold and Silver Refinery; Degussa) became sole {{owners of}} Degesch in 1922. There, {{beginning}} in 1922, , Bruno Tesch, and others worked on packaging hydrogen cyanide in sealed canisters {{along with a}} cautionary eye irritant and adsorbent stabilizers such as diatomaceous earth. The new product was also labelled as Zyklon, but it became known as Zyklon B to distinguish it from the earlier version. Heerdt was named the inventor of Zyklon B in the Degesch patent application (number DE 438818) dated 20 June 1922. The German Patent Office awarded the patent on 27 December 1926. Beginning in the 1920s, Zyklon B was used at U.S. <b>Customs</b> <b>facilities</b> along the Mexican border to disinfect the clothing of [...] border crossers.|$|E
500|$|In 1920, an {{airfield}} {{was established}} at Saint-Inglevert {{on a different}} site to the former military airfield. Facilities developed {{over the years to}} include two hangars, <b>customs</b> <b>facilities</b> and ultra short wave radio. In March 1920, a Notice to Airmen was issued stating that Saint-Inglevert was open and fuel, oil and water were available, but there were no hangars or repair facilities. A proposal to designate Saint-Inglevert as a customs airfield in order to relieve Le Bourget of some of its workload was made in April 1920. Facilities then in existence included hangars, repair facilities and a radio station. Later that month, it was notified that an aerial lighthouse had been installed at the airfield, flashing the Morse letter A, and Saint-Inglevert became a customs airport on 20 May. By July, the provision of ground signals at Saint-Inglevert had begun. A [...] arrow was displayed indicating the wind direction. In August, it was reported that Saint-Inglevert was sending weather report by radio seven times a day to Le Bourget. By October, aids available included a windsock and a landing T. Requirements for aircraft to perform clockwise or anticlockwise circuits when landing were indicated by the flying of a red or white flag respectively. The aerial lighthouse was reported to be out of action in November 1920.|$|E

2500|$|Concourse E also {{dates back}} to the terminal's 1959 opening, and was {{originally}} known as Concourse 4. From the start, it was the airport's only international concourse, containing its own immigration and <b>customs</b> <b>facilities.</b> In the mid-1960s it underwent renovations similar to the airport's other original concourses, but didn't receive its first major addition until the opening of the International Satellite Terminal in 1976. Featuring Gates E20–E35 (commonly known as [...] "High E"), the satellite added 12 international gates capable of handling the largest jet aircraft as well as an international intransit lounge for arriving international passengers connecting to other international flights. The concourse and its satellite were briefly linked by buses until the airport's first automated people mover (Adtranz C-100) opened in 1980. At the same time Concourse E's immigration and <b>customs</b> <b>facilities</b> were radically overhauled and expanded. During the late 1980s the original portion of Concourse E ("Low E") was rebuilt to match the satellite.|$|E
