In the wake of these two incidents, the Aquino government further reacted by filing a diplomatic protest to the Chinese Embassy in Manila for the intrusions and by beefing up the AFP’s presence in the disputed territorial waters (Storey 2011). Accordingly, the Philippine government asserted that the Reed Bank is well within the country’s EEZ and belongs to the KIG, and is therefore not part of the contested areas of the Spratlys.

40|$|Every year Norwegian <b>Coastguard</b> <b>vessels</b> are {{involved}} in different salvage, towage and environmental damage operations. This thesis identifies the rules involved in such operations, and explores the rules from a Coastguard perspective. All three subjects are closely connected, and {{major part of the}} thesis is relevant to all three situations. Environmental damage and towage will often {{be a part of a}} salvage operation, so a major part of this thesis involves salvage operations. Some rules are though special to towage and some to environmental damage operations. On many occasions will those operations also be outside the category of salvage. Salvage, towage and environmental damage operations creates special legal considerations. Many of these considerations will apply to all kinds of <b>vessel.</b> When the <b>Coastguard</b> performs such operations some special considerations are relevant. Part of the discussion will aslo be of general interest. In all three kinds of operations will it be an increased risk of damages to material and personnel. A major part of the discussion is on the rules on liability for damages in such operations. In the thesis it is discussed if the fact that the Coastguard does the salvage, towage or environmental damage operations will change the question of liability. It will also identify how the Coastguard may limit its liability...|$|R
