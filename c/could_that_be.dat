2500|$|Daniel Howard-Snyder and Paul Moser, in the {{introduction}} to a volume of papers on the idea of divine hiddenness as evidence against theism, cite Nietzsche's question as anticipating this contemporary theme: [...] "a god who is all-knowing and all-powerful and who does not even make sure his creatures understand his intentions — <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> a god of goodness?" ...|$|E

50|$|The time-saving bias {{describes}} people's {{tendency to}} misestimate the time <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> saved (or lost) when increasing (or decreasing) speed. In general, people underestimate the time <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> saved when increasing from {{a relatively low}} speed (e.g., 25 mph or 40 km/h) and overestimate the time <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> saved when increasing from a relatively high speed (e.g., 55 mph or 90 km/h). People also underestimate the time <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> lost when decreasing from a low speed and overestimate the time <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> lost when decreasing from a high speed.|$|R
2500|$|On February 8, 2012 {{the name}} of the series was revealed, All the Wrong Questions, along with the first book's title, Who <b>Could</b> <b>That</b> <b>Be</b> at This Hour?. The series is to follow Lemony Snicket's {{childhood}} in [...] "an organization nobody knows about". The first book has been given a first printing of one million copies and was released on October 23, 2012. The title of the first book had earlier been hinted at in a message to fansite 667 Dark Avenue, where it was apparently designated as [...] "The First Question". The second book is titled [...] "When Did You See Her Last?" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{her face}} was white, her hair tawny and flying in the wind. <b>Could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> Allie? It must be she. It was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good heavens!" [...] cried Elizabeth; [...] "but how <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be?</b> How could {{his will}} be disregarded? Why {{did you not}} seek legal redress?" ...|$|E
60|$|FALDER. It's not my fault, sir, {{that she}} couldn't {{get rid of}} him --she would have if she <b>could.</b> <b>That's</b> <b>been</b> the whole trouble from the beginning. [Looking {{suddenly}} at WALTER]... If anybody would help her! It's only money wants now, I'm sure.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Could</b> it <b>be</b> <b>that</b> {{they had}} <b>been</b> delayed? <b>Could</b> it <b>be</b> <b>that</b> {{they had had}} to drop for repairs and were still uncaptured? <b>Could</b> it <b>be</b> <b>that</b> even now while this fool babbled, they were over there among the {{mountains}} heaving their deadly charge {{over the side of}} the aeroplane? ...|$|R

6000|$|What old fashion <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be,</b> Paul {{wondered}} with a palpitating heart, {{that was}} so visibly expressed in him; so plainly seen by so many people! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I?" [...] {{the girl}} said quietly, with a demureness which was not all mockery. [...] "How <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be?</b> Such a {{responsibility}} would be too onerous for me." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{farmers of}} the Heidmark, for whom hunting [...] "was {{inherited}} from the blood of their forebears", as tradition has it, would have reimbursed themselves. They poached whenever they <b>could.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> considered an unwritten right {{and not as a}} sin. Nevertheless the gendarmes had to track down the poachers and hand them over to the courts.|$|R

6000|$|... "But whose spirit? Whose?" [...] I persisted. [...] "When I am {{here alone}} in the garden, why, it is just peace. How <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be,</b> if an evil spirit haunted here?" ...|$|E

60|$|Ranse {{looked again}} at the clear-faced, bronzed, smiling cowpuncher who stood at Collins's side. <b>Could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> Curly? He held out his hand, and Curly grasped it with the muscles of a bronco-buster.|$|E

30|$|A {{possible}} explanation for why the younger groups had higher hospital charges <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> those who qualify for Medicare {{under the age of}} 65 have significant comorbidities <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> increasing their cost of care.|$|R
50|$|However, the pub is more {{commonly}} known as The Dirty Duck. It is unclear where this name originates from. One reason <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> given this name by brewery families who played darts in the pub. Another reason <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> actors nicknamed it The Dirty Duck. It is the only pub in England which has a licence under its two names.|$|R
60|$|Lady Muriel {{had just}} risen {{and left the}} party. <b>Could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> {{the cause of his}} despondency? The Theory hardly rose to the dignity of a Working Hypothesis. Clearly more Facts were needed.|$|E

60|$|Chopin! The polonaise in A flat. Good! <b>Could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> Gyp? Very good! He moved out, {{down the}} passage, drawn on by her playing, and softly turned the handle. The music stopped. He went in.|$|E

50|$|There are {{variations}} {{arising from}} geography that impact culture. For example, the state features some areas <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> classified as urban (such as Boise), and others <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> classified as decidedly rural.|$|R
50|$|Alberta, among others, argued <b>that</b> there <b>were</b> no {{flaws in}} the present {{passport}} system <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> fixed, and <b>that</b> the proposed Act contained nothing <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> found in current provincial legislation.|$|R
60|$|<b>Could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> {{the face}} of her cousin Pieter van de Werff, and, if so, what passion had stamped that strange seal thereon? She turned herself in her seat {{and looked at him}} who drove her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, poor child!" [...] said I; [...] "no {{doubt it}} must have been sick, and being a burden, has been left behind. But stay. How <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> {{possible}} if it was found between the camp and this village?" ...|$|E
60|$|What <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be?</b> Was it {{something}} real or only a shadow? Dick {{rubbed his eyes}} and peered out more sharply than ever. It was not a shadow, but a real form, slowly moving around {{to the rear of}} the house.|$|E
60|$|Therefore he {{rang the}} bell, and tossing himself negligently on a sofa, ordered 'Some dinner at six - with a beefsteak in it,' and {{got through the}} {{intervening}} {{time as well as}} he <b>could.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> not particularly well; for he remained in the greatest perplexity, and, as the hours went on, and no kind of explanation offered itself, his perplexity augmented at compound interest.|$|R
5000|$|Once the {{isolation}} is complete the volatiles are detected using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) [...] which {{will produce a}} chromatogram <b>that</b> will <b>be</b> interpreted by a fire chemist. The interpretation is completed by comparing the sample chromatograms with chromatograms from known ignitable liquid samples <b>that</b> <b>were</b> analyzed on the same instrument. The chemist {{will be able to}} identify the ignitable liquids present in the sample by matching the sample chromatogram to a standard chromatogram that contains the highest degree of similarity. After the analyst has finished interpreting the results they will have one of three conclusions. One <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> ILRs <b>are</b> present and their identities will be determined (ex. Gasoline or Varsol). Another <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> ILRs <b>are</b> absent and the last <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the sample <b>was</b> inconclusive and a reanalysis needs to be completed.|$|R

The practices examined include a number <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> adopted by any rural landholder, those <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> applied by crop growers, and those <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> applied by graziers. Practices examined <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> applied by any landholder include the preparation of property or business plans, the encouragement of regrowth of native vegetation, attending short courses related to land management and participation in Government NRM programs...|$|R
