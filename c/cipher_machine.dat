5|$|Before 1932, the Cipher Bureau {{had succeeded}} in solving an earlier Enigma machine that functioned without a plugboard, but had been {{unsuccessful}} with the Enigma I, a new standard German <b>cipher</b> <b>machine</b> that was coming into widespread use. In late October or early November 1932, {{the head of the}} Cipher Bureau's German section, Captain Maksymilian Ciężki, tasked Rejewski to work alone on the German Enigma I machine {{for a couple of hours}} per day; Rejewski was not to tell his colleagues what he was doing.|$|E
5|$|Between July and December 1941, the {{garrison}} received 8,500 reinforcements. After years of parsimony, much equipment was shipped. By November, {{a backlog of}} 1,100,000 shipping tons of equipment intended for the Philippines had accumulated in U.S. ports and depots awaiting vessels. In addition, the Navy intercept station in the islands, known as Station CAST, had an ultra secret Purple <b>cipher</b> <b>machine,</b> which decrypted Japanese diplomatic messages, and partial codebooks for the latest JN-25 naval code. Station CAST sent MacArthur its entire output, via Sutherland, the only officer on his staff authorized to see it.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1941, Rejewski and Zygalski {{were asked}} to try solving {{messages}} enciphered on the secret Polish Lacida <b>cipher</b> <b>machine,</b> which was used for secure communications between Cadix and the Polish General Staff in London. Lacida was a rotor machine {{based on the same}} cryptographic principle as Enigma, yet had never been subjected to rigorous security analysis. The two cryptologists created consternation by breaking the first message within a couple of hours; further messages were solved in a similar way.|$|E
50|$|The C-35 and C-36 were <b>cipher</b> <b>machines</b> {{designed}} by Swedish cryptographer Boris Hagelin in the 1930s. These {{were the first}} of Hagelin's <b>cipher</b> <b>machines</b> to feature the pin-and-lug mechanism. A later machine in the same series, the M-209, was widely used by the United States military.|$|R
50|$|The Army {{developed}} their own <b>cipher</b> <b>machines</b> on the same principle as Enigma, 92-shiki injiki (九二式印字機), 97-shiki injiki (九七式印字機) and 1-shiki 1-go injiki (一式一号印字機) from 1932 to 1941. The Army judged that these machines had lower security than the Navy's Purple design, so the Army's two <b>cipher</b> <b>machines</b> were less used.|$|R
50|$|There {{were several}} books {{available}} that hint {{at ways to}} break <b>cipher</b> <b>machines.</b> William Friedman's The Index of Coincidence and Its Applications to Cryptography was revolutionary; the addition of advanced mathematical, especially statistical, methods to the cryptological toolkit made traditional cryptographic systems obsolete and machine systems breakable. So {{it is possible that}} the Japanese cryptanalysts knew that <b>cipher</b> <b>machines</b> were, in theory at least, breakable.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the organisation's Chief Planner, a Czech chess {{grandmaster}} named Kronsteen (Number 5), devises {{a plan to}} play British and Soviet intelligence {{against each}} other to procure a Lektor cryptographic device from the Soviets. SPECTRE's Chief Executive, Number1, puts Rosa Klebb (Number 3), a former Colonel of SMERSH (the counter-intelligence branch of Soviet Intelligence) who has defected to SPECTRE in the West, {{in charge of the}} mission as Chief of Operations. Klebb chooses Grant to protect Bond until he acquires the Lektor - then to eliminate 007 and steal the <b>cipher</b> <b>machine</b> for SPECTRE. As part of the scheme, Klebb recruits the beautiful Tatiana Romanova, a cipher clerk at the Soviet consulate in Istanbul, who believes the ex-Colonel to still be working for SMERSH.|$|E
25|$|Most German {{messages}} decrypted at Bletchley {{were produced}} {{by one or}} another version of the Enigma <b>cipher</b> <b>machine,</b> but an important minority were produced by the even more complicated twelve-rotor Lorenz SZ42 on-line teleprinter <b>cipher</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1929 the Polish {{mathematician}} Marian Rejewski, {{who helped}} {{to solve the}} German Enigma <b>cipher</b> <b>machine</b> in December 1932, began studying actuarial statistics at Göttingen. At the request of his Poznań University professor, Zdzisław Krygowski, on arriving at Göttingen Rejewski laid flowers on Gauss's grave.|$|E

50|$|The (Hagelin) C-52 and CX-52 were <b>cipher</b> <b>machines</b> {{manufactured}} by Crypto AG starting 1951/1952. These pin-and-lug type <b>cipher</b> <b>machines</b> were advanced successors of the C-38/M-209. The machine measures 8 1/2in &times; 5 3/8in &times; 4 3/8in. The device is mechanical, but {{when combined with}} an electric keyboard attachment, the B-52, the resultant system is termed the BC-52. The B-52 is larger, measuring 12 1/2in &times; 8 1/2in &times; 6 3/8in.|$|R
25|$|Friedman {{used his}} {{understanding}} of rotor machines to develop several that were immune to his own attacks. The best of the lot, the SIGABA—which was destined to become the US's highest-security <b>cipher</b> <b>machine</b> in World War II—was co-invented by Frank Rowlett. At least one patent related to it was finally granted after Friedman had died.|$|E
25|$|On {{entering}} World War II in June 1940, the Italians {{were using}} book codes {{for most of}} their military messages. The exception was the Italian Navy, which after the Battle of Cape Matapan started using the C-38 version of the Boris Hagelin rotor-based <b>cipher</b> <b>machine,</b> particularly to route their navy and merchant marine convoys to the conflict in North Africa.|$|E
25|$|In February 1941, Captain Abe Sinkov and Lieutenant Leo Rosen of the US Army, and US Naval Lieutenants Robert Weeks and Prescott Currier, {{arrived at}} Bletchley Park bringing, amongst other things, {{a replica of}} the 'Purple' <b>cipher</b> <b>machine</b> for the Bletchley Park's Japanese section in Hut 7. The four {{returned}} to America after ten weeks, with a naval radio direction finding unit and many documents including a 'paper Enigma'.|$|E

50|$|Mealy {{machines}} {{provide a}} rudimentary mathematical model for <b>cipher</b> <b>machines.</b> Considering the {{input and output}} alphabet the Latin alphabet, for example, then a Mealy machine can be designed that given a string of letters (a sequence of inputs) can process it into a ciphered string (a sequence of outputs). However, although one could use a Mealy model to describe the Enigma, the state diagram would be too complex to provide feasible means of designing complex <b>ciphering</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{his book}} Spycatcher, former MI5 {{operative}} Peter Wright discusses {{use of an}} acoustic attack against Egyptian Hagelin <b>cipher</b> <b>machines</b> in 1956. The attack was codenamed [...] "ENGULF".|$|R
25|$|A common myth {{surrounding}} the bombing (due {{in part to}} such books as Winterbotham's The Ultra Secret) is that Coventry was deliberately undefended to prevent the Germans realising that Enigma <b>cipher</b> <b>machine</b> traffic (information from which was termed Ultra) was being read by British cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park. This claim is untrue – Winston Churchill was aware that a major bombing raid was to take place, but no-one knew where the raid was meant to strike {{before it was too}} late to evacuate.|$|E
25|$|Little {{was done}} to prepare for air attack. Inter-service rivalries between Kimmel and Short did not improve the situation. Particularly, most {{intelligence}} information was sent to Kimmel, assuming he would relay it to Short, and vice versa; this assumption was honored mostly in the breach. Hawaii {{did not have a}} Purple <b>cipher</b> <b>machine</b> (although, by agreement at the highest levels between U.S. and UK cryptographic establishments, four had been delivered to the British by October 1941), so Hawaii remained dependent on Washington for intelligence from that (militarily limited) source. However, since Short had no liaison with Kimmel's intelligence staff, he was usually left out of the loop. Henry Clausen reported the war warnings could not be more precise because Washington could not risk Japan guessing the U.S. was reading important parts of their traffic (most importantly Purple), as well as because neither was cleared to receive Purple.|$|E
500|$|Upon their return, {{all three}} soon joined the Government Code and Cypher School (GC) at Bletchley Park. Milner-Barry was {{recruited}} by mathematician Gordon Welchman, {{who had been}} his contemporary at Trinity College; in turn Milner-Barry recruited Hugh Alexander. Arriving in early 1940, he joined Welchman's [...] "Hut 6" [...] section, whose task was to solve the Enigma <b>cipher</b> <b>machine</b> as used by the German Army and Air Force.|$|E

50|$|Development of OKW/Chi <b>cipher</b> <b>machines</b> rested {{with the}} Ordnance office. Although OKW/Chi remit was to analyze {{a number of}} devices to find their {{perceived}} weaknesses, they never constructed any themselves.|$|R
50|$|Pinwheels {{might be}} turned through a purely {{mechanical}} action (as in the M-209) or electromechanically (as in the Lorenz SZ 40/42). Other <b>cipher</b> <b>machines</b> which used pinwheels include the C-52, the CD-57 and the Siemens and Halske T52.|$|R
500|$|The Bureau's leading Enigma {{cryptanalyst}} Marian Rejewski {{commented that}} the <b>cipher</b> <b>machine</b> may be surmised {{to have been a}} commercial-model Enigma, since at that time the military model had not yet been devised. [...] "Hence this trivial episode was of no practical importance, though it does fix the date at which the Cipher Bureau's interest in the Enigma machine began"manifested, initially, in the entirely legal acquisition of a single commercial-model Enigma.|$|E
500|$|Marian Adam Rejewski ( [...] 16 August 1905 – 13 February 1980) was a Polish {{mathematician}} and cryptologist who reconstructed the Nazi German military Enigma <b>cipher</b> <b>machine</b> sight-unseen in 1932. [...] The cryptologic {{achievements of}} Rejewski and colleagues Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski enabled the British to begin reading German Enigma-encrypted messages {{at the start}} of World War II, seven years after Rejewski's original reconstruction of the machine. The intelligence that was gained by the British from Enigma decrypts formed part of what was code-named Ultra and contributed—perhaps decisively—to the defeat of Germany.|$|E
500|$|In late 1927 {{or early}} 1928, there {{arrived at the}} Warsaw Customs Office from Germany a package that, {{according}} to the accompanying declaration, was supposed to contain radio equipment. [...] The German firm's representative strenuously demanded that the package be returned to Germany even before going through customs, {{as it had been}} shipped with other equipment by mistake. [...] His insistent demands alerted the customs officials, who notified the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau, which took a keen interest in new developments in radio technology. [...] And since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, the Bureau's experts had ample time to look into the matter. [...] They carefully opened the box and found that it did not, in fact, contain radio equipment but a <b>cipher</b> <b>machine.</b> [...] They examined the machine minutely, then put it back into the box.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to code books and manual ciphers, the Imperial Japanese Navy also utilized electric <b>cipher</b> <b>machines</b> known as JADE and CORAL {{using the same}} technology as PURPLE. While OP-20-G took the lead on these systems, Bletchley provided some contributions.|$|R
50|$|Virtually all rotor based <b>cipher</b> <b>machines</b> (from 1925 onwards) have {{implementation}} flaws {{that lead}} to {{a substantial number of}} weak keys being created. Some machines have more problems with weak keys than others, as modern block and stream ciphers do.|$|R
50|$|Arvid Gerhard Damm (27 May 1869 - 1927) was a Swedish {{engineer}} and inventor. He designed {{a number of}} <b>cipher</b> <b>machines,</b> {{and was one of}} the early inventors of the wired rotor principle for machine encipherment. His company, AB Cryptograph, was a predecessor of Crypto AG.|$|R
2500|$|Dönitz {{revived the}} World War I idea of {{grouping}} several submarines {{together into a}} [...] "wolfpack" [...] to overwhelm a merchant convoy's defensive escorts. Implementation of wolfpacks had been difficult in World War I owing to the limitations of available radios. In the interwar years, Germany had developed ultrahigh frequency transmitters which it was hoped would make their radio communication unjammable, while the Enigma <b>cipher</b> <b>machine</b> was believed to have made communications secure. Dönitz also adopted and claimed credit for Wilhelm Marschall's 1922 idea of attacking convoys using surface or very-near-the-surface night attacks. This tactic had the added advantage of making a submarine undetectable by sonar.|$|E
2500|$|In 1671, Leibniz {{began to}} invent a machine that could execute all four {{arithmetic}} operations, gradually improving it {{over a number of}} years. This [...] "stepped reckoner" [...] attracted fair attention and was the basis of his election to the Royal Society in 1673. A number of such machines were made during his years in Hanover by a craftsman working under his supervision. They were not an unambiguous success because they did not fully mechanize the carry operation. Couturat reported finding an unpublished note by Leibniz, dated 1674, describing a machine capable of performing some algebraic operations. Leibniz also devised a (now reproduced) <b>cipher</b> <b>machine,</b> recovered by Nicholas Rescher in 2010. In 1693, Leibniz described a design of a machine which could, in theory, integrate differential equations, which he called [...] "integraph".|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, the Japanese {{introduced}} a new <b>cipher</b> <b>machine</b> for their most sensitive diplomatic traffic, replacing an earlier system that SIS referred to as [...] "RED." [...] The new cipher, which SIS called [...] "PURPLE", was different and much more difficult. The Navy's cryptological unit (OP-20-G) and the SIS {{thought it might be}} related to earlier Japanese cipher machines, and agreed that SIS would handle the attack on the system. After several months trying to discover underlying patterns in PURPLE ciphertexts, an SIS team led by Friedman and Rowlett, in an extraordinary achievement, figured it out. PURPLE, unlike the German Enigma or the Hebern design, did not use rotors but stepper switches like those in automated telephone exchanges. Leo Rosen of SIS built a machine — as was later discovered, using the identical model of switch that the Japanese designer had chosen.|$|E
50|$|The Enigma family {{included}} multiple designs. The earliest were commercial models {{dating from}} the early 1920s. Starting in the mid-1920s, the German military began to use Enigma, making a number of security-related changes. Various nations either adopted or adapted the design for their own <b>cipher</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War it {{produced}} {{large numbers of}} Typex <b>cipher</b> <b>machines,</b> derived from the German Enigma, {{for use by the}} British armed forces and other government departments. In 1959 it merged with the competing British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) to form International Computers and Tabulators (ICT).|$|R
50|$|The Lorenz SZ40, SZ42, SZ42A and SZ42B were German rotor stream <b>cipher</b> <b>machines</b> {{used by the}} German Army during World War II. They were {{developed}} by C. Lorenz AG in Berlin. The model name SZ was derived from Schlüssel-Zusatz, meaning cipher attachment. The instruments implemented a Vernam stream cipher.|$|R
