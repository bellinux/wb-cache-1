The MD 199 designation was removed from that road in 1954. That same year, construction began on modern US 50 (John Hanson Highway) {{at the southern end}} of Glenn Dale Road. Glenn Dale Road had previously continued southeast from its bridge across Lottsford Branch and followed what is now Belvidere Road south of US 50 to its southern end at MD 556 (now MD 193). After the US 50 freeway {{was constructed}}, Glenn Dale Road was relocated to head due east from Lottsford Branch to MD 556. In 1965, MD 193 was extended east from the BaltimoreWashington Parkway in Greenbelt to the Glenn Dale level crossing of the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak Northeast Corridor), then south along Glenn Dale Road to MD 556 just north of US 50. The <b>current</b> <b>curve</b> just west of MD 953's southern terminus was added in 1983, replacing the piece of Glenn Dale Road that continues straight east but dead ends before MD 193. Two years later, MD 193 was moved to the new Glenn Dale Boulevard and replaced MD 556 south to MD 214. Old MD 193 remained a state highway but was split by the closing of the Glenn Dale railroad crossing in favor of MD 193's bridge over the railroad on its new alignment. Glenn Dale Road was designated MD 953 by 1993.|$|E
