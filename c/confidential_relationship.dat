The pair were accused of acting on [...] "messianic" [...] impulses by Yuval Diskin, former head of the Shin Bet, who added that their warmongering rhetoric appealed to [...] "the idiots within the Israeli public". Diskin's remarks were supported by former Mossad chief Meir Dagan, who himself had previously said that an attack on Iran was [...] "the stupidest thing I have ever heard". A few weeks later, the RAND Corporation (a leading American think-tank that advises the Pentagon) also openly disagreed with Netanyahu's belligerent stance: [...] "In doing so, and without naming names, RAND sided with former Mossad chief Meir Dagan and former head of the Shin Bet Yuval Diskin." ...|$|E

The Division in the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) for 'Professional <b>confidential</b> <b>relationship</b> privilege' and how it is excluded or lost is at Division 1A This is often interpreted as being between a health professional and their patient. It may however, extend to confidential advice from social workers, and accountants.. NSW has also added a 'Sexual assault communications privilege' at Division 1B [...] Therefore, when considering the access and adducing decisions for medical records that may also cover sexual assault records, the first consideration of course will be relevance, and then any NSW court or tribunal may exclude any evidence of either 'Professional <b>confidential</b> <b>relationship</b> privilege' or 'Sexual assault communications privilege' or both. These sections of the Act aimed to provide further restrictions and protections against oppressive discovery that can cause undue harm to a party in court and may dissuade them from seeking medical care or counselling or damage those relationships, see for example, R v A and B [...] for an appeal on an application in a case for access to discovery across 'Professional <b>confidential</b> <b>relationship</b> privilege' and 'Sexual assault communications privilege' and how the exclusions are decided.|$|E

50|$|Vitro was {{incorporated}} in 1950 as the Vitro Manufacturing Company. Its main product was slide transparencies for overhead projectors. For some time prior to incorporation, the founders had produced tinted lighting gels {{for the theater}} and stage industry, and were known for their leadership {{in the production of}} gels used to replicate the lighting characteristics of the outdoors on a sunny day. These gels had this quality because of the admixture of salts of uranium, which are bright yellow. This business had positioned Vitro as a ready source of uranium during US military and scientific research efforts into nuclear energy during the Second World War. It seems likely that the <b>confidential</b> <b>relationships</b> developed in this time-frame with US government entities led to later contracting and development business arrangements.|$|R

40|$|Current {{law allows}} {{defendants}} {{to use a}} preexisting relationship to give credibility to a defense of consent or reasonable, good faith belief of consent. However, the law acknowledges various connections between people and recognizes that under certain circumstances it is appropriate both to prevent a person from acting and to require a person to act. If courts applied the doctrine of <b>confidential</b> <b>relationships</b> to acquaintance rape, evidence of the relationship would impose upon the defendant a heightened duty of care to the victim. This heightened duty of care would change the mental element of the crime. It would also change the definition of consent to mean positive words or positive action indicating a freely given agreement to have sexual contact. Finally, it deters the defendant from introducing evidence of the prior relationship or prior conduct between the victim and the defendant as relevant to showing consent to sexual contact during the disputed incident. Instead, the prosecution may introduce evidence of the prior relationship and conduct to impose on the defendant a heightened duty to obtain consent...|$|R

50|$|A {{non-disclosure}} agreement (NDA), {{also known as}} a confidentiality agreement (CA), confidential disclosure agreement (CDA), proprietary information agreement (PIA) or secrecy agreement (SA), is a legal contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties. It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement. An NDA creates a <b>confidential</b> <b>relationship</b> between the parties to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information or trade secrets. As such, an NDA protects non-public business information.|$|E

The fund passed the e-fits to the police—the Polícia Judiciária and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received them when they became involved in August 2011—but did not otherwise release them.

40|$|While HIV {{infection}} is considered protected information {{in most parts}} of the world, it is clear that if a health care provider knows, that the patient is infected or is likely to be infected, then either the patient or those responsible for making their medical decisions must be informed of the infection or likelihood of infection. If not, the liability exposure of the health care provider, like the virus itself, will spread to more and more people. It must be remembered that despite the existence of a <b>confidential</b> patient-physician <b>relationship,</b> a health care provider has a duty to warn a clearly identifiable third party of possible serious harm. This reliance suggests that states may eventually extend provider liability to significant others and individuals with whom the provider knows, or has reason to believe, the infected individual is engaged in activity which may spread this virus. The focus by the courts reinforces the need for health care providers to stay current with local reporting requirements and their legal obligations...|$|R

We show via theoretical studies and empirical evaluations that various similarity measures can be exploited by attackers to significantly improve their confidence and accuracy of predicted sensitive links between nodes with high similarity values. ...|$|R
