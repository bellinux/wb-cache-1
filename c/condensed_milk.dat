The Algarrobina Cocktail is made from pisco, <b>condensed</b> <b>milk,</b> and sap from the Peruvian algarroba tree. Another similar cocktail, from the United States, is the Californian pisco punch, {{originally}} made with Peruvian pisco, pineapples, and lemon.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 {{the town}} was {{described}} as having an antique appearance, with its principal trade being salt, along with fruit and vegetables, and small silk and heavy cotton works.

5|$|By the 1830s the British Agricultural Revolution had {{disturbed}} traditional {{society and}} created a class of labourers who struggled to support their families in rural areas. This led to an unrest known as the Swing riots which swept across southern England, consequently reaching Selborne and Liphook in September 1830. The Parliamentary Enclosure Acts of 1856 established a new land pattern for nearby Steep Marsh and Stroud, which still exists today. There was also extensive land drainage between 1860 and 1880; conduits and sluices were constructed to take water from Ashford Stream for the artificial flooding of hay meadows. In Steep, hops were grown for use in local breweries, watercress produced for commercial use, and a <b>condensed</b> <b>milk</b> factory was in operation in Steep Marsh.|$|E

Popular Japanese beverages such as sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that, typically, contains 15%~17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice. Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 1800s and is produced in many regions by companies including Asahi Breweries, Kirin Brewery, and Sapporo Brewery – the oldest brand of beer in Japan. The Michelin Guide has awarded restaurants in Japan more Michelin stars {{than the rest of}} the world combined.|$|E
5|$|The balloon {{had carried}} {{a lot of}} food, of a kind adapted more for a balloon voyage than for travels on foot. Andrée had {{reasoned}} that {{they might as well}} throw excess food overboard as sand, if losing weight was necessary; and if it was not, the food would serve if wintering in the Arctic desert did after all become necessary. There was therefore less ballast and large amounts of heavy-type provisions, 767kg (1690lb) altogether, including 200liters of water and some crates of champagne, port, beer, etc., donated by sponsors and manufacturers. There was also lemon juice, though not as much of this precaution against scurvy as other polar explorers usually thought necessary. Much of the food was in the form of cans of pemmican, meat, sausages, cheese, and <b>condensed</b> <b>milk.</b> By the time they crashed, they had thrown some of it overboard. The three men took most of the rest with them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking utensils, making a load on each sled of more than 200kg (440lb). This was not realistic, as it broke the sleds and wore out the men. After one week, they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non-essential equipment, bringing the loads down to 130kg per sled. It became more necessary than ever to hunt for food. They shot and ate seals, walruses, and especially polar bears throughout the march.|$|E
25|$|<b>Condensed</b> <b>milk</b> is cow's {{milk from}} which {{water has been}} removed and to which sugar has been added, {{yielding}} a very thick, sweet product that can last for years without refrigeration if unopened.

50|$|According to the {{writings}} of Marco Polo, in the 13th century the Tatars were able to <b>condense</b> <b>milk.</b> Marco Polo reported that ten pounds (4.5 kg) of milk paste was carried by each man, who would subsequently mix the product with water.

50|$|In 1856, {{after three}} years of {{refining}} his model, Borden received the patent for his process of <b>condensing</b> <b>milk</b> by vacuum. At that time, he abandoned the meat biscuit, to focus on his new product. Having lost so much money in his beef biscuit endeavors, Borden was forced to recruit partners to begin production and marketing of this new product. He offered Thomas Green three-eighths of his patent rights and gave James Bridge a quarter interest on his investment; together, the three men built a condensery in Wolcottville, Connecticut (within modern-day Torrington), which opened in 1856. Green and Bridge were eager for profits, and when the factory was not immediately successful, they withdrew their support; it closed within a year.|$|R

25|$|In 1927, the Free State {{government}} {{established a}} new semi-state body, the Dairy Disposal Company, to regularise and rationalise the industry.

The company continued to operate under State control until the early 1970s. At that stage, the government decided to break up the Dairy Disposal Company and transfer ownership of the creameries to a number of farmer co-operatives. In 1974, most of what remained of the <b>Condensed</b> <b>Milk</b> Company was sold to one of these, Golden Vale, subsequently a subsidiary of the Kerry Group.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Condensed</b> <b>Milk</b> Company of Ireland Limited was an Irish {{manufacturer}} of dairy products and, in its heyday, {{the largest of}} its kind in the United Kingdom.

25|$|Through his {{contacts}} with Irish farmers, Cleeve saw {{the potential to}} process milk and manufacture dairy products for home consumption and export.

There, the partners set up a factory to produce <b>condensed</b> <b>milk</b> and butter.|$|E
40|$|In this {{literature}} review automatic milking is reviewed on two main topics, the role within product quality and control {{systems and the}} possibilities of applying reverse osmosis on the farm. The milking process is a key process within a total quality management system on dairy farms. The milk production process was analysed using a Pareto analysis, identifying the main factors Man, Materials, Methods and Machinery. For each of these main factors quality control has been described for both automatic milking and conventional <b>milking.</b> On-farm <b>condensing</b> of <b>milk</b> {{will contribute to the}} reduction of transport costs between the dairy farmer and the dairy processor. In The Netherlands on-farm <b>condensing</b> of <b>milk</b> is not practised due to lack of profitability (long payback times). However with the introduction of automatic milking on dairy farms, new chances appear. The high level of automation within AM-systems, the relatively low milk flow per hour, availability of high-tech cleaning systems within AM-systems and the overall scaling up of dairy farms can be mentioned as chances in reducing payback times of condensing equipment...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. This {{study was}} {{prompted}} by a concern over the poor performance of 'Nestle Infant Cereal with Soya' raised during ad hoc discussions held with Sales and Marketing Managers. It represents an investigative study of the marketing issues associated with the poor performance of the product {{with a view to}} establish possible causes and their likely solutions. Nestle was founded by Henry Nestle in 1866 and today it is the world's leading food company. It is Switzerland's largest industrial company with more than 480 worldwide operations. The company is present in different markets which are demarcated into zones. Zone one represents Europe, Zone two — Asia, Zone three — Latin America, Zone four — North America and Zone five — Africa and the Middle East. It has more than 200 000 employees worldwide. Over the years, the company grew through mergers with other companies such as Anglo Swiss <b>Condense</b> <b>milk,</b> Chocolate Suisse S. A., Alimentina S. A. (Manufacturers of Maggi products and acquisition of carnation USA), Buitoni-Perugina (Italy), Rowntree (Great Britain) and Perrier (France).
