500|$|Joey Thurmond of Push Square wrote how playing {{through the}} {{campaign}} from Modern Warfare {{reminded him of}} its sheer memorability and how it had long endured with fans compared with other games in the series, saying [...] "there's tension and gravity shot through the experience, {{as if the world}} is on your shoulders to push past every enemy line with explosive bravado or exacting stealth. [...] There's a grounded feel to player characters that make you another cog in the machine with the abilities and limitations of an ordinary soldier, not a supernatural saviour." [...] He praised the game's graphical enhancements, saying [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered looks and sounds like a fresh game on par with today's graphical and aural standards" [...] and calling it a [...] "ridiculously faithful remake", but wrote that the game still showed some slight signs of age, such as artificial intelligence problems and pacing issues. In short, he commended Raven Software [...] "for arguably delivering the most substantial, masterful remake we have ever experienced", and that [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered celebrates this legacy with updated visuals and sound that really go above and beyond the call of duty, sprucing up an old <b>care</b> <b>package</b> for a more modern age to near-perfection." ...|$|E
