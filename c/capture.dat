5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} important element of Pokémon gameplay. Although other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured, the player can use different kinds of Poké Balls on a wild Pokémon during battle. A successful <b>capture</b> adds the Pokémon to the player's active party or stores it if the player already has the maximum of six Pokémon. Factors in the success rate of <b>capture</b> include the HP of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used; the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of <b>capture</b> is. Also, inflicting certain status effects such as sleep or paralysis add a multiplier to the <b>capture</b> rate, making it easier to <b>capture</b> wild Pokémon. Each species has a <b>capture</b> rate of its own as well.|$|E

The Americans, assigned to land at Utah and Omaha, were {{to cut off the}} Cotentin Peninsula and <b>capture</b> the port facilities at Cherbourg. The British at Sword and Gold, and the Canadians at Juno, were to <b>capture</b> Caen and form a front line from Caumont-l'Éventé to the south-east of Caen {{in order to protect the}} American flank, while establishing airfields near Caen. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give the Anglo-Canadian forces a suitable staging area for a push south to <b>capture</b> the town of Falaise. A secure lodgement would be established and an attempt made to hold all territory captured north of the Avranches-Falaise line during the first three weeks. The Allied armies would then swing left to advance towards the River Seine.|$|E

5|$|Close {{encounters}} {{between the}} Sun and other stars in its birth cluster could {{have resulted in}} the <b>capture</b> of a planet from beyond the Solar System. Three-body interactions during these encounters can perturb the path of planets on distant orbits around another star, or free-floating planets, in a process similar to the <b>capture</b> of irregular satellites around the giant planets, leaving one in a stable orbit around the Sun. A planet that originated in a system with a number of Neptune-massed planets and without Jupiter-massed planets, could be scattered into a more long-lasting distant eccentric orbit, increasing its chances of <b>capture</b> by another star. Although this increases the odds of the Sun capturing another planet from another star, a wide variety of orbits are possible, reducing the probability of a planet being captured on an orbit like that proposed for Planet Nine to 1–2 percent. In a simulation where the <b>capture</b> takes place between co-planar systems a large number of other objects are also captured into orbits aligned with the planet, potentially allowing this <b>capture</b> scenario to be distinguished from others. The likelihood of the <b>capture</b> of a free-floating planet is much smaller, with only 5–10 of 10,000 simulated free-floating planets being captured on orbits similar to that proposed for Planet Nine.|$|E
