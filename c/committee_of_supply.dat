2500|$|The {{establishment}} of the regiment had been proposed to the House of Commons <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> on 19 November 1793 by Major-General Richard FitzPatrick on behalf of Alexander Hay. Alexander was known as [...] "Sandie" [...] Leith-Hay after inheriting Leith Hall from his brother, and later taking on the additional titles of Hay of Rannes to honour his great uncle Andrew Hay, a renowned jacobite in the 1745 rising. He was a regular army soldier who had been commissioned lieutenant upon his birth and promoted to captain in the 7th Dragoons {{at the age of}} ten, as well as a noted laird in Aberdeenshire. On 8 March 1794 Leith-Hay wrote to Sir George Yonge, 5th Baronet, Secretary of State for War, to remind him of his offer to recruit soldiers to fight in the French Revolutionary Wars, and he was granted a letter of service to raise the regiment on 2 April 1794.|$|E

60|$|Is it not {{the same}} virtue which does {{everything}} for us here in England? Do you imagine, then, {{that it is the}} land-tax which raises your revenue? that it is the annual vote in the <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> which gives you your army? or that it is the Mutiny Bill, which inspires it with bravery and discipline? No! surely no! It is the love of the people; it is their attachment to their government, from the sense of the deep stake they have in such a glorious institution, which gives you your army and your navy, and infuses into both that liberal obedience, without which your army would be a base rabble, and your navy nothing but rotten timber.|$|E
60|$|With {{these ideas}} rooted in their minds, the Commons of Great Britain, in the {{national}} emergencies, will never seek their resource from the confiscation of the estates of the Church and poor. Sacrilege and proscription are not among {{the ways and means}} of our <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Supply.</b> The Jews in Change Alley have not yet dared to hint their hopes of a mortgage on the revenues belonging to the see of Canterbury. I am not afraid that I shall be disavowed, when I assure you that there is not one public man in this kingdom, whom you wish to quote,--no, not one, of any party or description,--who does not reprobate the dishonest, perfidious, and cruel confiscation which the National Assembly has been compelled to make of that property which it was their first duty to protect.|$|E

60|$|Such is the {{imperfection}} {{of human}} wisdom that the Committee totally failed in their well-laid project. They were totally mistaken in their man. Under that cold outside the commissioner, Paterson, concealed a firm, manly, and fixed principle, a deciding intellect, {{and a feeling}} heart. My Lords, he {{is the son of}} a gentleman of a venerable age and excellent character in this country, who long filled the seat of chairman of the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Supply</b> in the House of Commons, and who is now enjoying repose from his long labors in an honorable age. The son, {{as soon as he was}} appointed to this commission, was awed by and dreaded the consequences. He knew to what temptation he should be exposed, from the known character of Debi Sing, to suppress or to misrepresent facts. He therefore took out a letter he had from his father, which letter was the preservation of his character and destruction of his fortune. This letter he always resorted to in all trying exigencies of his life. He laid the letter before him, and there was enjoined such a line of integrity, incorruptness, of bearing every degree of persecution rather than disguising truth, that he went up into the country in a proper frame of mind for doing his duty.|$|E

60|$|A gross error {{had been}} made by the <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> when Washington, on taking command, had {{required}} a return of the ammunition. They had returned the whole amount of powder collected by the province, upwards of three hundred barrels; without stating what had been expended. The blunder was detected on an order being issued for a new <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> cartridges. It was found that there were but thirty-two barrels of powder in store. This was an astounding discovery. Washington instantly despatched letters and expresses to Rhode Island, the Jerseys, Ticonderoga and elsewhere, urging immediate <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> powder and lead; no quantity, however small, to be considered beneath notice.|$|R

60|$|The provincial Congress {{conducted}} its {{affairs with}} {{the order and}} system so formidable to General Gage. Having adopted a plan for organizing the militia, it had nominated general officers, two of whom, Artemas Ward and Seth Pomeroy, had accepted. The executive powers were vested in a <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> safety. This was to determine when the services of the militia were necessary; was to call them forth,--to nominate their officers to the Congress,--to commission them, and direct {{the operations of the}} army.

2500|$|While Venezuelans were {{suffering}} from shortages of food, the Bolivarian government created the Local <b>Committees</b> <b>of</b> <b>Supply</b> and Production (CLAP). The committees, controlled by supporters of President Maduro, were designated to provide subsidized food and goods to poor Venezuelan households directly. According to the Vice President of Venezuela, AristÃ³bulo IstÃºriz, CLAPs are a [...] "political instrument {{to defend the}} revolution". Allegations arose that only supporters of Maduro and the government were provided food while critics were denied access to goods. PROVEA, a Venezuelan human rights group, described CLAPs as [...] "a form of food discrimination that is exacerbating social unrest".|$|R

50|$|The DSA scheme will be {{reviewed}} under two guiding principles, announced Acting Minister for Education (Schools) Ng Chee Meng in the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Supply</b> Debate in Parliament today (8 Apr).

The review aims to expand opportunities for students with specific aptitudes and talents by providing more schools with distinctive programmes. This will allow students with specific domain talents and achievements to be recognised - which was its original objective - instead of general academic ability.|$|E

[...] Members from Toronto and those along the main route of the Trent led the attack. The resulting debate continued well into the evening, and the Hansard records over 1,000 words on the topic in the acrimonious debate. The Liberals were just able to defeat the motion when the division bells rang.|$|E

5000|$|In defence of {{the task}} force and [...] "Three Secretaries Meeting", Leung {{described}} the Wang Chau housing project as a [...] "very rare opportunity for the government to be able to build large numbers of public housing units", which justified him taking charge {{of the task}} force.
