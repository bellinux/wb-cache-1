Cultures of this strain have been recovered from the monkey lesions as late as 3 years after inoculation and have been shown to reproduce the granular disease in monkeys. Six additional strains of Bacterium granulosis have been isolated from cases of trachoma occurring in the Indian schools of Arizona. The cultures thus obtained are identical morphologically and culturally with those isolated by Noguchi and have induced the same <b>chronic</b> granular <b>conjunctivitis</b> in monkeys. Advanced untreated cases are more favorable for cultural study than treated cases. Cultures of Bacterium granulosis kept on semisolid medium containing 10 per cent rabbit serum ("leptospira medium") remain viable for many months at room temperature, and sealed ampoules of such cultures have been found to retain their pathogenicity for the monkey conjunctiva for at least 69 days at room temperature and at least 284 days at 4 ° to 6 °C. Several additional cultural and biological characteristics of Bacterium granulosis have been described. Of outstanding importance is the fact that cocaine, in contradistinction to novocain, has a bactericidal effect on the organism.

40|$|ABSTRACT Rosacea is a chronic, {{progressive}} disease of unknown cause affecting {{the eye and}} the facial skin. Ocular rosacea is often underdiagnosed if the ophthalmologist does not inspect the patient’s face adequately during the ocular examination. Severe ocular complications and blindness can occur if the treatment is delayed because of non-diagnosis of the rosacea. Here, we present a case of ocular rosacea in a 78 -year-old Caucasian woman. Based on the ocular lesions, which preceded cutaneous involvement, she was misdiagnosed as having ocular cicatricial pemphigoid initially. This case emphasizes the difficulty in diagnosis when ocular findings precede those of skin manifestations, and rosacea {{should be kept in}} mind in the differential diagnosis of <b>chronic</b> cicatrizing <b>conjunctivitis...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Chlamydia trachomatis causes many infections, {{including}} eye infections. They manifest as inclusion conjunctivitis and trachoma. The {{agent is}} transmitted by dirty hands, eyeliners, medical instruments and via swimming-pool water or, in neonates, by passage through an infected birth canal. Due to the nonspecific clinical features {{at the beginning}} of the infection and delayed application of symptomatic, anti-allergic and non-specific antibiotic therapy, Chlamydia aetiology is usually established only after laboratory diagnosis in the chronic stage of infection. Objective. Determining the frequency of Chlamydia trachomatis antigen in conjunctival and genital samples of adult patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> in Nišava district. Methods. Our retrospective study was carried out on 116 patients (63 female and 53 male) with clinical signs and symptoms of <b>chronic</b> <b>conjunctivitis.</b> Chlamydia trachomatis antigen was detected by a direct immunofluorescence test with labelled monoclonal antibodies. Results. From a total of 116 examined patients in 37 patients Chlamydia trachomatis antigen was detected; 17 female and 20 male. Thirty-three of the patients had a bilateral infection and four unilateral. Among 24 patients who were also tested for Chlamydia trachomatis antigen collected by ocular and genital swabs, 19 had conjunctivitis associated with urethritis/vaginitis. Conclusion. The studied group of patients showed that the common cause of the <b>chronic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> were bacteria, but predominantly Chlamydia trachomatis.

Although most types of allergic conjunctivitis do not affect vision, VKC is unusual in that damage to the cornea from the condition can result in vision loss.

Although the pathophysiology of VKC is better understood in recent years, allowing more targeted therapies, management of these patients can still be very challenging, and complications can occur.

40|$|AIMS. To {{identify}} and determine antibiotic susceptibility of coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) isolated from patients with <b>chronic</b> blepharitis, purulent <b>conjunctivitis,</b> and suppurative keratitis. METHODS. A retrospective review of all culture positive cases of <b>chronic</b> blepharitis, purulent <b>conjunctivitis,</b> and suppurative keratitis between July 1995 and December 1996 was performed. Cases in which CoNS were the sole isolates were analysed. Species identification {{was performed by}} using a commercially available standardised biochemical test system. Antibiotic susceptibility to penicillin, gentamicin, tetracycline, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and teicoplanin was determined by agar disc diffusion (Kirby–Bauer method). Teicoplanin resistance was confirmed by agar dilution. RESULTS. 42 Staphylococcus epidermidis, four S. warneri, three S. capitis, two S. hominis, one each of S. xylosus, S. simulans, S. equorum, and S. lugdunensis were identified. 37 CoNS were penicillin resistant, 12 gentamicin resistant, 28 tetracycline resistant, 18 erythromycin resistant, four ciprofloxacin resistant, and one teicoplanin resistant (MIC, 32 μg/ml). In total, 16 strains were resistant to three or more antibiotics. CONCLUSION. Species of CoNS apart from S. epidermidis may be isolated from patients with corneal and external infection. Antibiotic susceptibility of CoNS is unpredictable and multiresistant strains are common. As a result, antibiotic susceptibility testing should be performed in all cases of clinically significant ocular infections caused by CoNS...|$|R
