40|$|One of the {{challenges}} facing the gold industry in the 21 st century is the continuing need to identify new reserves of economically treatable ores. Discoveries of large, metallurgically simple orebodies are becoming increasingly rarer, forcing companies to investigate options for the processing of ores which may present recovery, economic and/or environmental issues, requiring innovative approaches to their treatment. Ores which contain naturally occurring carbonaceous material (‘preg-robbing ores’) are {{an example of one}} such ore type. Newmont’s Jundee operation contains zones of carbonaceous ore within the oxidised orebody. A program consisting of detailed laboratory work and extensive plant trials has been undertaken to assess the options of the processing of this material. Laboratory tests demonstrated the advantage of carbon-in-leach (CIL) over direct cyanide leaching and carbon-in-pulp (CIP) for treatment of these ores. The laboratory program identified several factors which would enhance overall gold recoveries where preg-robbing ore was being processed, including: keeping preg-robbing ore separate from non-graphitic ore; maximising gravity recovery; and ensuring the plant operates in ‘pure’ CIL mode, ie no leaching prior to first adsorption tank. Several plant trials were undertaken to assess the economic sustainability of treating moderate preg-robbing ores through a modified gravity/leach/adsorption circuit. Results indicated that where good operational control of the circuit was maintained to ensure high gravity recovery, minimal leaching prior <b>to</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>contact,</b> and maintenance of good, active carbon inventory, then acceptable and sustainable overall gold recoveries could be obtained. Using these relatively simple plant modifications potentially allows a plant to treat ores with preg-robbing index (PRI) values up to one. When PRI values rise to 1. 3 - 1. 6, leach recoveries can drop from > 85 per cent to < 40 per cent, indicating a more intensive approach may be required, including kerosene addition and higher carbon inventories and activities...|$|R

40|$|Aluminium smelter {{reduction}} cells typically {{operate at}} 4. 5 V and 100 - 400 kA DC. The voltage loss associated with electrical conductors and connections is approximately 0. 4 V, which equates to 10 per {{cent of the}} total electricity consumed in the reduction cell. It is estimated that process improvements of 5 MW per plant (50 000 t CO 2 e pa for coal based electricity) are possible through optimization of the stub <b>to</b> <b>carbon</b> (STC) <b>contact</b> interfaces within the anode assembly. The objective {{of this study is}} to develop a finite element analysis (FEA) model to predict the voltage loss through the STC contact interfaces as a function of electrical contact resistance (ECR) and thus evaluate the effect of this ECR on cell operation. ECR is affected by the pressure and temperature at the STC contact surfaces and is potentially sensitive to a change in stub diameter or thermal properties of cover material. In this article, a sequentially coupled thermo-mechanical-electrical FEA has been developed to model the process of casting in a typical anode assembly and its subsequent usage in the reduction cell. The ECR and its dependence on temperature and contact pressure have been derived from data available in the public domain. The FEA results are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|This {{discussion}} describes {{efforts to}} produce a stable, efficient electrocatalyst for four-electron O 2 reduction through the direct attachment of fungal laccase, a 'blue' <b>copper</b> oxidase, <b>to</b> functionalised <b>carbon</b> electrode materials. Commercially available carbons, including fibrous and porous materials, offer important opportunities for achieving high conductivity over high surface areas that can be chemically functionalised. A promising approach for attaching laccase <b>to</b> a <b>carbon</b> surface is <b>to</b> use the diazonium coupling reaction to generate protrusive aromatic functionalities that can bind to hydrophobic residues close to the 'blue' Cu site: this site provides a fast, intramolecular electron relay into the buried trinuclear Cu active site that converts O 2 rapidly and cleanly to H 2 O. This enhancement procedure makes possible the stable, direct electrocatalytic reduction of O 2 at high potential with high efficiency in terms of turnover frequency per enzyme active site engaged with the electrode. The absence of electron-transfer mediators and simplicity of electrode system reveals the more inherent characteristics of the electrocatalytic mechanism that are masked in the waveform when a mediator is used.

The dusting behaviour of Ni-Cu alloys containing up to 50 wt% Cu, along with pure Cu, was investigated in a 68 %CO- 31 %H 2 - 1 %H 2 O gas mixture (a C : 19) at 680 °C for up to 150 h. Surface analysis showed that two types of carbon deposits, graphite particle clusters and filaments, were observed on pure Ni and Ni-Cu alloys with Cu contents of up to 5 wt%. Alloys with more than 10 wt% Cu showed very little coking, forming filaments only. SEM and TEM analyses revealed metal particles encapsulated by graphite shells within the graphite particle clusters, and metal particles at filament tips or embedded along their lengths. A kinetic investigation showed that alloy dusting rates decreased significantly with increasing <b>copper</b> levels up <b>to</b> 10 wt%.

Although pure copper is not catalytic <b>to</b> <b>carbon</b> formation, scattered carbon nanotubes were observed on its surface.

Nicotinic acid is decarboxylated by heating with <b>copper</b> chromite <b>to</b> give <b>carbon</b> dioxide (C- 7) and pyridine. The pyridine is converted into 4 -nitropyridine 1 -oxide, which is heated with aqueous calcium hypobromite to give tribromonitromethane. Combustion of the latter gives carbon dioxide derived from C- 4 of the nicotinic acid. Nicotinic acid is also reduced to nipecotic acid, which is oxidized to succinic acid by acidic potassium permanganate. Stepwise degradation of the succinic acid by standard procedures gives two samples of carbon dioxide, which correspond to C- 3, C- 6 and C- 4, C- 5 of the nicotinic acid. Benzoylation of the nipecotic acid, followed by oxidation with permanganate at pH 7, gives 5 -amino- 4 -carboxyvaleric acid; this is converted into 2 -methyleneglutaric acid {{by the action of}} nitrous acid. Hydrogenation of the 2 -methyleneglutaric acid over rhodium in methanol gives 2 -methylglutaric acid, which is oxidized with dilute chromic acid to acetic acid.

Sputtered Permalloy electrodes designed with shape anisotropy were used <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> <b>Carbon</b> nanotubes grown by chemicalvapour deposition in lateral spin-valve structures. The magnetoresistance of these spin-valves were measured at low-temperatures {{and as a}} function of the charge state of the quantum dots. Two conductance regimes were measured in a Carbon nanotube spinvalve with Permalloy nucleation pads. At high bias outside of the coulomb blockade regime a ~ 10 % magnetoresistance was measured that is analogous to giant-magnetoresistance, in that it is due to spindependent scattering at the ferromagnet-Carbon nanotube interfaces. At lower bias the device enters the coulomb blockade regime and the magnetoresistance observed develops a different structure, over a larger field range, together with the development of an offset in conductance between saturations. The maximum value of this MR was MR ~ 245 % and it was attributed to changes in the induced charge on the quantum dot. By modifying the design of the Permalloy electrodes, a single domain state at the point of <b>contact</b> of the <b>Carbon</b> nanotube was achieved. A well defined anti-parallel state of the Permalloy electrodes, with associated changes in the conduction of the devices was observed, yet the conductance offset remained, with a maximum MR of ~ 60 %. The positions of the coulomb peaks were measured during magnetic reversal of the electrodes, showing the change in induced charge on the quantum dot, with a maximum MR ~ 350 %. Predictions of device transport based on the magneto-coulomb effect and spin-dependent interfacial phase shifts were compared to experimental results and found to not fit the observed behaviour.
