40|$|Semantics (WFS) for logic programs, {{but in a}} few {{pathological}} cases {{its engine}} treats atoms as undefined that are true or false in WFS. The {{reason for this is}} that the XSB does not implement the SLG ANSWER <b>COMPLETION</b> <b>operation</b> in its engine, the SLG-WAM – rather ANSWER COMPLETION must be performed by post-processing the table. This engine-level omission has not proven significant for applications so far, but the need for ANSWER COMPLETION is becoming important as XSB is more often used to produce well-founded residues of highly non-stratified programs. However, due to its complexity, care must be taken when adding ANSWER COMPLETION to an engine. In the worst case, the cost of each ANSWER <b>COMPLETION</b> <b>operation</b> is proportional to the size of a program P, so that the operation must be invoked as rarely as possible, and when invoked the operation must traverse as small a fragment as possible of P.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{significant}} development in logging tools designed to acquire information of the downhole events during drilling operations. This development has not been as significant in <b>completion</b> <b>operations,</b> making it difficult to analyze successes and failures that occur downhole {{due to the lack of}} data. The i-Con Drill String Dynamics Logging Tool has been developed by Trican Completion Solutions to be used for downhole data acquisition in wells during <b>completion</b> <b>operations.</b> It contains sensors that measure downhole parameters such as pressure inside the installation string, annular pressure, torque, temperature and axial loads. As of June 2016, the i-Con tool has been run during the installation of lower completion in five wells at the Ivar Aasen Field. The wells are all long, horizontal oil producers from 4600 m MD to 6200 m MD, completed with sand screens. During the installation, the tool was located directly above the liner hanger running tool as this was the main point of interest in the well. The downhole data acquired by the tool in the five oil producers was analyzed, with particular attention payed to five specific downhole events: 1 - Installation of the lower completion 2 - Anchoring the lower completion 3 - Circulation through the lower completion 4 - Isolating the lower completion 5 - Pressure testing the lower completion The goal of this analysis was to determine the typical fingerprint behavior for each event, and to evaluate areas of improved visibility that appear when using downhole data in addition to surface data. In order to achieve this, plots were made in Microsoft Excel. Some plots show all data from the lower completion installations, while others only display relevant data for each downhole event. The main findings based on the analysis include that there are clear fingerprint behaviors for several variables in many of the downhole events. The acquired downhole data provides new information to draw a more complete picture of the downhole events taking place in the five oil producers at Ivar Aasen. Another more general conclusion is that downhole data sets like these can be used to adjust and optimize future <b>completion</b> <b>operations.</b> It also provides documentation and verification that tools have run through their intended cycles and operations.
