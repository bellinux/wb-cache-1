The brain regions that are active during working memory tasks are also being evaluated, and research has shown that different parts of the brain are activated during working memory in younger adults as compared to older adults. This suggests that younger and older adults are performing these tasks differently.|$|E

40|$|The {{duration}} that saltstone {{retains its}} ability to immobilize some key radionuclides, such as technetium (Tc), plutonium (Pu), and neptunium (Np), depends on its capacity to maintain a low redox status (or low oxidation state). The <b>reduction</b> <b>capacity</b> {{is a measure of}} the mass of reductants present in the saltstone; the reductants are the active ingredients that immobilize Tc, Pu, and Np. Once reductants are exhausted, the saltstone loses {{its ability to}} immobilize these radionuclides. The <b>reduction</b> <b>capacity</b> values reported here are based on the Ce(IV) /Fe(II) system. The Portland cement (198 {micro}eq/g) and especially the fly ash (299 {micro}eq/g) had a measurable amount of <b>reduction</b> <b>capacity,</b> but the blast furnace slag (820 {micro}eq/g) not surprisingly accounted for most of the <b>reduction</b> <b>capacity.</b> The blast furnace slag contains ferrous iron and sulfides which are strong reducing and precipitating species for a large number of solids.

40|$|Several {{causes of}} delay are {{deterring}} the air transportation system from being efficient. System <b>capacity</b> <b>reductions</b> {{are the major}} cause of delay. However, {{there are also some}} other causes, directly imputable to airlines, which may produce, in combination with the <b>capacity</b> <b>reductions,</b> undesired downstream effects. Therefore, with the purpose of containing delays and disruptions in flight schedules, it is important to grant flexibility to flight operations. This paper presents a mathematical formulation that allows to determine the degree of flexibility given to flights by identifying through a set of temporal intervals, called time windows, those flights that have a larger impact on the air traffic system performances. A time window is a period of time during which a certain phase of the flight (e. g., take off, landing and entry into a sector) has to be executed. The size of the time windows is variable as it reflects system’s capacity constraints. The set of time windows, which maximizes the total width of the time windows, provides airline operators and air traffic control authorities with the largest degree of flexibility to perform their operations. Several formulations of the models are presented, which vary in the way of formulating the use of system capacity. However, by means of a computational analysis, we show that the solution of the time window model is insensitive to the formulation used for the capacity constraints...|$|R
