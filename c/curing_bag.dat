Rows of new presses are lined up at center as two men on a step ladder are welding them in place. In the foreground at right, two men {{are looking at a}} map of the factory. Overhead, metal rafters and pipes can be seen. Florescent lights are suspended from the rafters. The presses all have the letters "NRM" on them.; Part of a six million dollar expansion program, the presses were intended to boost tire output at the factory by fifty percent. They produced tupless tires and conventional tires for both 14 " and 15 " wheel. One of the most modern types of curing presses, the Anto Form equipment featured the <b>curing</b> <b>bag</b> as part of the press...|$|E

50|$|A {{vacuum bag}} is a {{bag made of}} strong rubber-coated fabric or a polymer film used to {{compress}} the part during cure or hardening. In some applications the bag encloses the entire material, or in other applications a mold is used to form one face of the laminate with the bag being a single layer to seal to {{the outer edge of}} the mold face.When using a tube shaped bag, the ends of the bag are sealed and the air is drawn out of the bag through a nipple using a vacuum pump. As a result, uniform pressure approaching one atmosphere is applied to the surfaces of the object inside the bag, holding parts together while the adhesive <b>cures.</b> The entire <b>bag</b> may be placed in a temperature-controlled oven, oil bath or water bath and gently heated to accelerate curing.|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} an experimental mechanical characterisation campaign on composites {{made out of}} a quasi-unidirectional basalt fabric. In order to evaluate the ability of commercial basalt fabrics and their composites to meet the potentials of basalt fibers, the work has used raw materials from commercial catalogs with no further modification. Two common manufacturing techniques for medium performance composites have been adopted: vacuum assisted resin infusion, and hand-impregnated vacuum bagging. Two panels, one for each technique, have been fabricated, able to provide {{a sufficient number of}} samples for a comprehensive stiffness and strength characterization through Tensile, Flexural, In-Plane Shear, Short Beam Shear, Double Cantilever Beam and End-Notched Flexural tests. Results revealed a significant dependence of the mechanical properties on the manufacturing processes, due to their different ability to fully impregnate the dry fabric assembly, and on the quality of fiber/matrix adhesion. In general, hand-impregnation followed by vacuum <b>bag</b> <b>curing</b> was able to guarantee a better impregnation, which in particular yielded superior Interlaminar Shear Strength and Interlaminar Fracture Toughness performances...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} determination of purge bag materials properties, development of purge bag manufacturing techniques, experimental {{evaluation of a}} subscale purge bag under simulated operating conditions and the experimental evaluation of the purge pin concept for MLI purging are discussed. The basic purge bag material, epoxy fiberglass bounded by skins of FEP Teflon, showed no significant permeability to helium flow under normal operating conditions. Purge bag small scale manufacturing tests were conducted to develop tooling and fabrication techniques for use in full scale bag manufacture. A purge bag material layup technique was developed whereby the two plys of epoxy fiberglass enclosed between skins of FEP Teflon are vacuum <b>bag</b> <b>cured</b> in an oven in a single operation. The material is cured on a tool with {{the shape of a}} purge bag half. Plastic tooling was selected for use in bag fabrication. A model purge bag 0. 6 m in diameter was fabricated and subjected to a series of structural and environmental tests simulating various flight type environments. Pressure cycling tests at high (450 K) and low (200 K) temperature as well as acoustic loading tests were performed. The purge bag concept proved to be structurally sound and was used for the full scale bag detailed design model...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 28 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 6 - 9 July 2009 "Sustainable Transport", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the strength of enzyme treated soil material. Thus the aim of the paper is to present laboratory results on the effects of two enzyme-based liquid chemicals as soil stabilizers. Soil samples were prepared for standard geotechnical tests from two types of soils treated with the two enzyme-based products. One soil had a plasticity index of 35 and the other had a plasticity index of 7. The maximum plasticity index reduction after treatment of both soils was less than 5 % and therefore not significant. A slight improvement in the maximum dry density was obtained following treatment by one product on one of the soil samples. Unconfined compressive strength was evaluated after the samples were left to <b>cure</b> in plastic <b>bags</b> for 7, 14 and 28 days and revealed a mixed effect on strength. Those instances where there was increase in strength it was less than 50 % with increase in concentration level of the two enzyme-based stabilizers and age for both soils after treatment. More independent investigations on the effects of enzymes based liquid stabilisers on the strength of treated soils are required if the level of their acceptance in road construction is to be enhanced.

40|$|Investigations were {{completed}} in two areas of research. Firstly mechanical compression test coupons of unidirectional carbon fibre composite were optimised to produce repeatable and reproducible {{data to support}} automotive structural applications. The compressive strength was determined through ASTM D 695 M testing, {{and the results were}} correlated with test variations implemented. Various preparation methods were evaluated in the determination of the cause of variation found in unidirectional carbon fibre test specimens. Analytical tools were implemented, including microscopical techniques, Scanning Electron Microscope, Talyscan and X-Ray Tomography to determine initiation of failure and to quantify the damage encountered by the compressive test specimen. The findings correlated well with the mechanical test results, which indicate that the higher quality laminates in terms of surface and edge finishes will have better mechanical properties compared to lower quality composites. Secondly, the characterisation of the surface of a material designed for automotive body applications. The CBS 95 is manufactured by Gurit UK and has been designed to be the first carbon fibre material to be <b>cured</b> using vacuum <b>bagging</b> and have no evidence of print through at the surface. Various characterisation tools, including Proscan 2000, microscopical techniques, and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis, were used to evaluate anomalies found at the surface of the components manufactured from CBS 95. The origin and formation mechanisms of the anomalies was sought and explained with use of models and the analytical equipment, two main origins were found: porosity and kitting defects. Additionally, the sustainability of CBS 95 exposed to harsh environments was investigated. The CBS 95 was exposed for 20 weeks in three different environments (hot/dry, hot/wet and chemical). Analytical techniques such as MINOLTA Spectrophotometer CM- 500 Series, Gloss analyser and microscopical techniques were used to quantify the environmental degradation of the CBS 95. The CBS 95 performed consistently {{in each of the three}} environments. The work has also made many recommendations for improved manufacturing routes for both the compressive test specimen and the CBS 95, reducing processing time and improving quality. These suggestions, when considered together, contribute significantly to carbon fibre manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|Composites {{have been}} {{extensively}} used in high performance structural applications due their lightweight and better {{strength to weight}} ratio. A common defect in angle ply laminates {{is caused by the}} low velocity impacts, due to their poor resistance to accidental impact by foreign objects, and also the defect is barely visible. Actually contact zone between the target and the penetrating object is relatively large and the whole structure is affected even well away from the impact point. This type of interaction can generate large delaminations, which can reduce the strength under compressive loading. At present, allowance for the delamination induced strength reduction is given by maintaining the strain limits to the structures that prevent the failure due to delamination. If any damage is found in the structure, {{it is not easy to}} repair due to the larger damage area. Carbon auxetic composites can be considered as good candidate materials with special properties required for today’s modern technology. This thesis presents the study of auxetic laminates and their response to low velocity multiple impact events in order to assess the damage behaviour of the laminates. These materials are of great interest because the damage area created is smaller, which does not affect the whole structure as compared to the conventional carbon laminates. As received unidirectional 12 k tow fibre reinforced, high performance (IM 7 / 8552), epoxy resin pre-preg, which one of the stiffest fibre matrix systems, was used to prepare 24 -layers auxetic and positive Poisson’s ratio laminates. This work focuses on four stacking sequences; all through-thickness auxetic and positive Poisson’s ratio laminates were prepared with [± 30]s and [35 /- 20 / 25 / 40 /- 85 / 40 / 25 /- 45 / 35 /- 15 / 25 / 40] s angles, respectively. Stacking angles for the in-plane auxetic and positive Poisson’s ratio laminates were designed as [0 / 15 / 75 / 15]s and [0 /- 70 / 10 / 25]s respectively. These laminates were <b>cured</b> by vacuum <b>bagging</b> technique before testing in order to achieve the highest quality specimens. All the tests presented in this work are conducted on 100 mm 2 squared size specimens, by using a standard 12. 7 mm steel hemisphere indentor. In this work multiple indentation and impact tests were conducted both at the initial test site and also away from the initial test site to determine the extent of damage zone. The most important conclusions and findings drawn from the experimental results are as follows. From the low velocity multiple impacts, indentation testing, fractography, residual testing and dynamic analysis it can be concluded that through-thickness auxetic laminates are found to be better than the positive Poisson’s ratio laminates, even though they were tested 20 mm away from the vicinity of the initial test site. Their confined damage area can prevent the structure from catastrophic failure because the damage is more concentrated at the test site and is easy to repair due to the smaller damage area. A preliminary study into the high velocity impact on the through-thickness laminates and the low velocity impacts on the in-plane laminates was also carried out in order to study their impact response. Here, auxetic and the positive Poisson’s ratio laminates show almost similar damage response to the high velocity impacts. However, auxetic in-plane laminates were found to have better resistant to an impact event as compared to the positive Poisson’s ratio specimens...|$|R
