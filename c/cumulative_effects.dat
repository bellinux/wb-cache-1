5|$|Carpentier was {{an admirer}} of the elegance and wit {{in the work of}} satirical French writers and artists of the eighteenth century, and often {{employed}} grotesques in his descriptions to ridicule the ostentation of colonial aristocracy. Examples include Ti Noel's comparison of wax heads at a barber's shop to white men's heads being served at a banquet, or the portrayal of the decadence of Mademoiselle Floridor, a fourth-rate actress who performs for slaves as an outlet for her desire to act. Carpentier further satirizes the pomp of those in power through a series of details of protocol and ceremony whose <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> ridicule the object of description, {{as is the case with}} Henri Christophe's chambers.|$|E
5|$|The devastating {{impact of}} this last war, added to the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> of a century of almost {{continuous}} conflict, left both empires crippled. When Kavadh II died only months after coming to the throne, Persia was plunged into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. The Sasanians were further weakened by economic decline, heavy taxation from Khosrau II's campaigns, religious unrest, and the increasing power of the provincial landholders. The Byzantine Empire was also severely affected, with its financial reserves exhausted by {{the war and the}} Balkans now largely {{in the hands of the}} Slavs. Additionally, Anatolia was devastated by repeated Persian invasions; the Empire's hold on its recently regained territories in the Caucasus, Syria, Mesopotamia, Palestine and Egypt was loosened by many years of Persian occupation.|$|E

Utilizing data from 50 countries over the period of 1970 to 2004, we find that inward FDI has a negative contemporaneous effect on domestic investment, while the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> of FDI over time tends to be positive. In addition, we separately study FDI in Developed Countries (DCs) and Less Developed Countries (LDCs). The effect of contemporaneous FDI on domestic investment is negative in DCs, and the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> of FDI is neutral.

25|$|Most of the {{economic}} traits are controlled by genes with small but <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects.</b> Although the potential of DH populations in quantitative genetics has been understood for some time, it was the advent of molecular marker maps that provided the impetus for their use in identifying loci controlling quantitative traits. As the quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects are small and highly influenced by environmental factors, accurate phenotyping with replicated trials is needed. This is possible with doubled haploidy organisms because of their true breeding nature and because they can conveniently be produced in large numbers. Using DH populations, 130 quantitative traits have been mapped in nine crop species. In total, 56 DH populations were used for QTL detection.|$|E
25|$|Historical ecology is a {{research}} program {{that focuses on the}} interactions between humans and their environment over long-term periods of time, typically over the course of centuries. In order to carry out this work, historical ecologists synthesize long-series data collected by practitioners in diverse fields. Rather than concentrating on one specific event, historical ecology aims to study and understand this interaction across both time and space in order to gain a full understanding of its <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects.</b> Through this interplay, humans adapt to and shape the environment, continuously contributing to landscape transformation. Historical ecologists recognize that humans have had world-wide influences, impact landscape in dissimilar ways which increase or decrease species diversity, and that a holistic perspective is critical to be able to understand that system.|$|E

However, few large-scale empirical studies are conducted to validate the existence of <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> in information diffusion on social networks. In this paper, using the population-scale dataset from the largest Chinese microblogging website, we conduct a comprehensive study on the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> in information diffusion. We base our study on the diffusion network of message, where nodes are the involved users and links characterize forwarding relationship among them. We find that multiple exposures to the same message indeed increase the possibility of forwarding it. However, additional exposures cannot further improve the chance of forwarding {{when the number of}} exposures crosses its peak at two. This finding questions the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> hypothesis in information diffusion. Furthermore, to clarify the forwarding preference among users, we investigate both structural motif in the diffusion network and temporal pattern in information diffusion process. Findings provide some insights for understanding the variation of message popularity and explain the characteristics of diffusion network...|$|R

25|$|The Rhodesian economy {{experienced}} a modest {{boom in the}} early 1970s. Real per capita earnings for blacks and whites reached record highs, although the disparity in incomes {{between blacks and whites}} remained, with blacks earning only about one-tenth as much as whites. After 1975, however, Rhodesia's economy was undermined by the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> of sanctions, declining earnings from commodity exports, worsening guerilla conflict, and increasing white emigration. When Mozambique severed economic ties, the Ian Smith regime was forced to depend on South Africa for access to the outside world. Real gross domestic product (GDP) declined between 1974 and 1979, before full independence in 1980. An increasing proportion of the national budget, an estimated 30%–40% per year, was allocated to defence, and a large budget deficit raised the public debt burden substantially.|$|E

The suppressor is made by Knight's Armament Company, and was selected over the one HK originally included {{as part of its}} entry. Insight Technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module, later designated AN/PEQ-6. One version of the LAM produces a visible light dot, while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles. There have since been different LAM models and, at least commercially, different suppressors as well. It has been reported by some users that the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> of recoil may occasionally cause the can of the suppressor to become slightly unscrewed, but that it is relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem.|$|E

The reasons for removal of the original bridge are controversial, and there was a groundswell of protest from a number of local residents. The bridge was removed regardless and the debate over whether this was the correct course of action has yet to be resolved in the minds of many residents. The building has been restored to its original state, but does not include the tower on the roof containing the clock removed from the chapel further up the hill, which was removed as a safety measure a long time ago.|$|E

25|$|Swayze, {{who was an}} FAA {{licensed}} pilot with {{an instrument}} rating, made the news on June 1, 2000, while flying with his dogs in his twin-engine Cessna 414 N414PS, from Van Nuys, California to Las Vegas, New Mexico. His plane developed a pressurization problem, causing Swayze to make a precautionary landing on a dirt road in a housing complex in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The plane's right wing struck a light pole, but Swayze was unharmed. He locked the cockpit, left the aircraft in the subdivision, and obtained a ride—with his dogs—from a passing vehicle driven by Gary Bruso, in order to telephone the authorities. According to the police report, witnesses said that Swayze appeared to be extremely intoxicated and asked for help to remove evidence—an open {{bottle of wine and}} a 30-pack of beer—from the crash site. He made himself unavailable to police for several hours. It was later determined that the alcohol in question was not in the cabin, but stored in external storage compartments inaccessible in flight and that the probable cause of the accident was Swayze's physical impairment due to the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> of carbon monoxide from engine exhaust by-products, carbon monoxide from heavy tobacco use, and the loss of an undetermined amount of cabin pressurization, resulting in hypoxia.|$|E
25|$|The devastating {{impact of}} this last war, added to the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> of a century of almost {{continuous}} conflict, left both empires crippled. When Kavadh II died only months after coming to the throne, Persia was plunged into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. The Sassanids were further weakened by economic decline, heavy taxation from Khosrau II's campaigns, religious unrest, rigid social stratification, and the increasing power of the provincial landholders. The Roman Empire was even more severely affected, with its financial reserves exhausted by the war, the Balkans now largely {{in the hands of}} the Slavs, Anatolia devastated by repeated Persian invasions, and the empire's hold on Syria, Mesopotamia, Palestine and Egypt loosened by many years of Persian occupation. Neither empire was given any chance to recover, as within a few years they were struck by the onslaught of the Arabs, newly united by Islam. The Sassanid Empire rapidly succumbed to these attacks and was completely destroyed. During the Byzantine-Arab Wars, the exhausted Roman Empire's recently regained southern provinces were also lost during the Muslim conquest of Syria, Egypt and North Africa, reducing the empire to a territorial rump consisting of Anatolia and a scatter of islands and footholds in the Balkans and Italy. These remaining lands were thoroughly impoverished by frequent attacks, marking the transition from classical urban civilization to a more rural, medieval form of society. However, unlike Persia the Roman Empire (in its medieval form usually termed the Byzantine Empire) ultimately survived the Arab assault, holding onto its residual territories and repulsing two Arab sieges of its capital Constantinople in 674 and 718.|$|E
25|$|In May, Nadeau was {{involved}} in what was regarded {{at the time as}} one of the most serious accidents in NASCAR history. While practicing for the race at Richmond International Raceway, Nadeau lost control of the No. 01 while trying to avoid another car in turn one and slammed into the wall driver side first. This was before the advent of SAFER barriers being installed at racetracks to dissipate the force from racing accidents, resulting in Nadeau impacting the unprotected concrete wall. He suffered fractures to his skull and several of his ribs along with a collapsed lung and temporary paralysis on his left side, and the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> would lead to his retirement as a driver. Busch Series veteran Jason Keller replaced Nadeau at the Richmond race finishing 32nd, and the team used several temporary substitutes for the rest of the year. Mike Wallace ran the next four races, then four more races afterwards (skipping Sonoma) with a best finish of 19th at Dover. Mike Skinner ran 11 races with the team after being released from Morgan McClure Motorsports, earning a pole at Richmond. Boris Said ran both road course races, also earning a pole as well as a sixth-place finish (both at Sonoma). Finally, the team signed Joe Nemechek, who had been released from Hendrick Motorsports' 25 car (where he had replaced Nadeau), to permanently drive the No. 01 car, running the last four races of the year and earning a top 10 at Atlanta. Said and Skinner earned spots in the 2004 Budweiser Shootout for their respective pole runs, with Boris in the 01 finishing 10th, and Skinner finishing 15th in the 10 Valvoline car.|$|E
