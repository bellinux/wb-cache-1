5|$|In English, when unit {{names are}} {{combined}} to denote multiplication {{of the units}} concerned, they are separated with a hyphen or a space (e.g. newton-metre or newton metre). The plural is formed by <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> last unit name to the plural form (e.g. ten newton-metres).|$|E
5|$|Kane scored {{his first}} Tottenham goal at White Hart Lane in a League Cup tie against Hull City, scoring the {{equaliser}} in extra time, the match finished 2–2. Tottenham won 8–7 on penalties, with Kane taking and <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> {{fifth of the}} nine sets of spot-kicks.|$|E
50|$|For {{addition}} of two base-φ numbers, add {{each pair of}} digits, without carry, and then <b>convert</b> <b>the</b> numeral to standard form. For subtraction, subtract each pair of digits without borrow (borrow is a negative amount of carry), and then <b>convert</b> <b>the</b> numeral to standard form. For multiplication, multiply in the typical base-10 manner, without carry, then <b>convert</b> <b>the</b> numeral to standard form.|$|R

5000|$|The {{coefficient}} [...] is {{the same}} value in all three forms. To <b>convert</b> <b>the</b> standard form to factored form, one needs only the quadratic formula to determine the two roots [...] and [...] To <b>convert</b> <b>the</b> standard form to vertex form, one needs a process called completing <b>the</b> square. To <b>convert</b> <b>the</b> factored form (or vertex form) to standard form, one needs to multiply, expand and/or distribute the factors.|$|R
5|$|Once the GWR was {{in control}} of the whole line from London to Penzance, it set about <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> {{remaining}} broad-gauge tracks. The last broad-gauge service left Paddington station on Friday, 20 May 1892; the following Monday, trains from Penzance were operated by standard-gauge locomotives.|$|E
5|$|About {{the time}} that Edwin died in 633, {{a member of the}} East Anglian royal family, Sigeberht, {{returned}} to Britain after his conversion while in exile in Francia. He asked Honorius, one of the Gregorian missionaries who was then Archbishop of Canterbury, to send him a bishop, and Honorius sent Felix of Burgundy, who was already a consecrated bishop; Felix succeeded in <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> East Angles.|$|E
5|$|Cædwalla sent Wilfrid to the Isle of Wight, {{which was}} still pagan, {{with the aim of}} <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants. The king also gave Wilfrid a quarter of the land on the island as a gift. In 688, the king relinquished his throne and went on a pilgrimage to Rome to be baptised, but died shortly after the ceremony. Wilfrid was {{probably}} influential in Cædwalla's decision to be baptised in Rome.|$|E

50|$|The Mimico {{radial line}} used Toronto gauge until 1922 when <b>the</b> Hydro-Electric Railways <b>converted</b> <b>the</b> line to {{standard}} gauge. When the TTC {{took over the}} line in 1927, it <b>converted</b> <b>the</b> line back to Toronto gauge.|$|R
5000|$|In speech {{synthesis}}, {{the front}} end refers to {{the part of the}} synthesis system that <b>converts</b> <b>the</b> input text into a symbolic phonetic representation, and <b>the</b> back end <b>converts</b> <b>the</b> symbolic phonetic representation into actual sounds.|$|R
5|$|Henry II had {{a square}} stone keep {{constructed}} in the 1180s by first Theobald de Valoignes and then Hugh de Morville, who rebuilt {{the remains of the}} castle. It was placed into the bailey wall, allowing it to directly support the outer defences. Thomas de Wyrkington conducted further work between 1199 and 1202 for King John, <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> castle entirely into stone.|$|E
5|$|In the {{synthesis}} of CMOS circuits, the function to be synthesized is represented as a formula in Boolean algebra. Then this formula is translated into two series-parallel multigraphs. These graphs {{can be interpreted as}} circuit diagrams in which the edges of the graphs represent transistors, gated by the inputs to the function. One circuit computes the function itself, and the other computes its complement. One of the two circuits is derived by <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> conjunctions and disjunctions of the formula into series and parallel compositions of graphs, respectively. The other circuit reverses this construction, <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> conjunctions and disjunctions of the formula into parallel and series compositions of graphs. These two circuits, augmented by an additional edge connecting the input of each circuit to its output, are planar dual graphs.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{predicted}} that the standing water caused by the storm surge would render {{most of the city}} uninhabitable for weeks and that the destruction of oil and petrochemical refineries in the surrounding area would spill waste into the flooding. The resulting mess would coat every surface, <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> city into a toxic marsh until water could be drained. Some experts said that it could take six months or longer to pump all the water out of the city.|$|E
50|$|Alcohol is metabolized {{mainly by}} the group of six enzymes collectively called alcohol dehydrogenase. These <b>convert</b> <b>the</b> ethanol into {{acetaldehyde}} (an intermediate more toxic than ethanol). The enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase then <b>converts</b> <b>the</b> acetaldehyde into non-toxic acetic acid.|$|R

5|$|MOX fuel {{has been}} in use since the 1980s, and is widely used in Europe. In September 2000, the United States and the Russian Federation signed a Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement by which each agreed to dispose of 34tonnes of weapons-grade {{plutonium}}. The U.S. Department of Energy plans to dispose of 34tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium in the United States {{before the end of}} 2019 by <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> plutonium to a MOX fuel to be used in commercial nuclear power reactors.|$|E
5|$|More unorthodox {{methods were}} also explored. Astrosystems International {{developed}} a so-called “Quartz Chamber” which burned pure oxygen and aircraft fuel, <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> chemical energy into light. The system was {{planned to be}} evaluated within a year, and installed in a similar arrangement to the more conventional BIAS. A plan, codenamed Moonshine, was also put forward. Moonshine {{was to be a}} joint effort with NASA to determine the feasibility of a geosynchronous satellite that could in project light directly down on any desired location.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the energy}} thus {{captured}} produces biomass and energy that is available for growth and development of other life forms. The majority {{of the rest of}} this biomass and energy are lost as waste molecules and heat. The most important processes for <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are metabolism and cellular respiration.|$|E
50|$|It was {{announced}} in 2011 by owners Benmore that the Theatre Royal would receive a £2 million refurbishment to <b>convert</b> <b>the</b> building into a live music venue. Plans to <b>convert</b> <b>the</b> building into a hotel and live music venue never came about.|$|R

It bears a hieroglyphic text that is woven into a criss-cross mat design to form a convoluted puzzle that must be read in precisely the right order to be understood.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{conquest of}} the Jaffna kingdom {{occurred}} after Portuguese traders arrived at the rival Kotte Kingdom in the southwest of modern Sri Lanka in 1505. Many kings of Jaffna, such as Cankili I, initially confronted the Portuguese in their attempts at <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> locals to Roman Catholicism, but eventually made peace with them.|$|E
5|$|The {{landline}} telephones in most residential {{homes are}} analog—that is, the speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage. Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly telephone service providers are transparently <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> signals to digital signals for transmission. The {{advantage of this}} is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication (as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise).|$|E

5|$|A minor Army-Air Force fight {{then broke}} out about what targets {{would be used}} for the Kwajalein tests. The Army favored using its Jupiter design, fired from Johnston Atoll in the Pacific, while the Air Force {{recommended}} using Atlas fired from Vandenberg AFB in California. The Army had already begun <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> former Thor launchers to Jupiter when an Ad Hoc Panel formed by the Department of Defense considered the issue. On 26 May 1960 they decided in favor of Atlas, and this was made official on 29 June when the Secretary of Defense ended pad conversion and additional Jupiter production earmarked for Zeus testing.|$|E
5|$|A £1million refubishment {{got under}} way in 1985 with the {{introduction}} of artificial turf, as well as the conversion of the ground to all-seater, which began a year later in 1986. The Oak Road End was filled with seats, while the Bobbers Stand had its seats ripped out to be replaced with executive boxes. The Main Stand's enclosure received seats, and work also began on <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> Kenilworth Stand, which had a roof added at this time. The stand would also receive seats in stages over the coming years.|$|E
5|$|After Montagu's death his son {{elected to}} {{continue}} living at nearby Townhill Park House, and South Stoneham was subsequently sold to University College Southampton (now the University of Southampton) {{for use as}} student accommodation. In 1964 the building was considerably altered by adding a 17-storey tower and a kitchen and dining complex to the building. In 2004 the University submitted plans to demolish these extensions {{with the intention of}} <b>converting</b> <b>the</b> original house into a conference venue and building new blocks of flats on the remaining landscaped gardens.
