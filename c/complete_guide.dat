5|$|Gossip {{was also}} a noted writer. His {{treatise}} The Chess-Player's Manual—A <b>Complete</b> <b>Guide</b> to Chess, a 900-page tome published in 1874 {{after several years of}} work, was harshly received by the critics, largely because he had included a number of informal skittles games that he had (atypically) won against stronger players. As a result, Gossip developed a lifelong enmity toward chess critics, whom he often attacked ferociously in his books. However, his 1879 book Theory of the Chess Openings was well received. Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Chess Champion, wrote that the 1888 edition of The Chess-Player's Manual {{was one of the best}} available books on the game. Thanks in part to a 122-page appendix by S. Lipschütz, it became one of the standard opening works of the time.|$|E

5|$|Starting with Final Fantasy III, Square began {{publishing}} guide {{books for}} its games which traditionally include additional content such as developer interviews and expanded plot and setting information. Studio BentStuff {{wrote the first}} Ultimania book for Final Fantasy VIII in 1999, though the company had been contracted to write Final Fantasy VII True Script Dissection for the previous game. Since then, Ultimania books have been written for every major Final Fantasy title, including Battle Ultimania, Scenario Ultimania, and Ultimania Omega editions for some games. Square experimented with online content delivery with Final Fantasy IX Online Ultimania, but the move was criticized for forcing customers to buy a print guide while releasing {{most of the information}} online. Another online Ultimania was planned for Final Fantasy XI, but it was dropped during development. Square Enix has produced expanded editions to some books, such as Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania Revised Edition. In addition to the Ultimania series, Square Enix also publishes an Official <b>Complete</b> <b>Guide</b> series of guide books.|$|E
