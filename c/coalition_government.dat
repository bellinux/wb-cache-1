40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{literature on}} common pool problems in fiscal policy suggests that government fragmentation increases public expenditures. In parliamentary regimes, the fragmentation hypothesis refers to (i) <b>coalition</b> <b>governments</b> and (ii) cabinet size. This paper explores {{the effect of}} <b>coalition</b> <b>governments</b> and cabinet size on public expenditures with panel data covering all 16 German States over the period 1975 - 2010. Identification is facilitated by the large within-variation {{in the incidence of}} <b>coalition</b> <b>governments</b> {{and the size of the}} cabinet in the German States. In addition, I exploit a feature of state electoral laws to construct a credible instrument for the likelihood of <b>coalition</b> <b>governments...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} types of government and level of public spending. There are two competing perspectives {{about the consequences of}} <b>coalition</b> <b>governments</b> for the size of public expenditures. The most common argument is that government spending increases under <b>coalition</b> <b>governments,</b> compared with one-party governments. Another line of thought contends that <b>coalition</b> <b>governments</b> are often stalled in the status quo due to the veto power of each member. Our analysis of public spending in 33 parliamentary democracies between 1972 and 2000 confirms the latter argument that <b>coalition</b> <b>governments</b> have a status quo bias. We find, particularly, that single-party governments are apt to modify the budget according to the current fiscal condition, which enables them to increase or decrease spending more flexibly. By contrast, <b>coalition</b> <b>governments</b> find it difficult not only to decrease spending under difficult fiscal conditions but also to increase it even under a more favorable context, because each member of the coalition has a veto power...|$|R
5|$|After Sharif's {{return to}} Pakistan from exile in 2007, Abbasi joined him {{and ran for}} {{a seat in the}} National Assembly in the 18 February 2008 general {{election}} as a candidate of the PML (N), and was successfully re-elected for the fifth time with 99,987 votes from Constituency NA-50 (Rawalpindi). The election resulted in a hung parliament where PPP had secured the most seats in the National Assembly and PML (N) the second most. After the formation of a <b>coalition</b> <b>government</b> between PPP and PML (N) with Yousaf Raza Gillani as Prime Minister, Abbasi was inducted into the federal cabinet of Gillani with the status of a federal minister in March 2008 and was appointed as the Minister for Commerce. However, he resigned from the ministerial office after PML (N) left the PPP-led <b>coalition</b> <b>government</b> in May 2008 to lead the movement to impeach Pervez Musharraf and to restore the judiciary.|$|E

5|$|Upon the resignation, Spooner was {{touted as}} Stevens' {{possible}} successor until Bruxner, {{who had always}} detested Spooner, refused to form a <b>coalition</b> <b>government</b> with him. At a UAP party meeting on 5 August, Spooner chose not to nominate and Steven's favoured candidate, Alexander Mair, defeated Athol Richardson 18 votes to 6, becoming Leader of the United Australia Party and {{was sworn in as}} Premier by Lord Wakehurst on the same day. Mair, who had got on well with Bruxner, ensured the survival of the <b>coalition</b> <b>government.</b> Mair attempted to shore up unity in his party to save the government. In the last months of government Bruxner was preoccupied with preparation for Australia's entry into the Second World War. He equipped railway workshops with modern machine tools and established National Emergency Services to deal with air raids.|$|E
5|$|After several {{rounds of}} {{negotiations}} mediated by Deng and Singapore's prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, FUNCINPEC, KPNLF, and the Khmer Rouge agreed {{to form the}} <b>Coalition</b> <b>Government</b> of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) in June 1982. The CGDK was headed by Sihanouk, and functioned as a government-in-exile. The UN defeated a resolution to expel Democratic Kampuchea and admit the PRK, effectively confirming Sihanouk as Cambodia's internationally recognized head of state.|$|E
40|$|Single-party {{governments are}} {{commonly}} {{thought to be}} more clearly responsible for <b>government</b> policy than <b>coalition</b> <b>governments.</b> One particular problem for voters evaluating <b>coalition</b> <b>governments</b> is how to assess whether all parties within a coalition should be held equally responsible for past performance. As a result, it is generally accepted that voters {{are less likely to}} hold <b>coalition</b> <b>governments</b> to account for past performance. This article uses data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems project to assess whether and how the composition of <b>coalition</b> <b>governments</b> affects the way in which people use their votes to hold governments to account, and which parties within coalitions {{are more likely to be}} held to account for the government's past performance.

5|$|Another {{public outcry}} arose when the {{government}}, seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania. At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the fiercely contested Vilnius Region. The <b>coalition</b> <b>government</b> directly confronted the Christian Democrats when it proposed a 1927 budget that reduced salaries to the clergy and subsidies to Catholic schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military reform program was revealed as a careless downsizing. Some 200 conservative military officers were fired. The military began planning the coup.|$|E
5|$|As the CPP {{required}} a two-third {{majority in the}} National Assembly to form a government, it offered FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP), which had come in third place in the elections, to become joint partners of a <b>coalition</b> <b>government.</b> Both Ranariddh and Rainsy, now the leader of his eponymous party refused, and filed complaints against election irregularities to the National Election Committee (NEC). When the NEC turned down their complaints, they organised public protests between 24 August until 7 September 1998, when riot police stepped in to break them up. Subsequently, Sihanouk meditated two meetings in September and November 1998, leading to a political deal being struck between CPP and FUNCINPEC in the second meeting. The deal provided for another <b>coalition</b> <b>government</b> between CPP and FUNCINPEC, with the latter as a junior coalition partner controlling the tourism, justice, education, health, culture and women's-cum-veteran's affairs portfolios. In exchange for FUNCINPEC's support for Hun Sen to become the sole Prime Minister, Ranariddh was made the President of the National Assembly.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{model of a}} parliamentary democracy where electoral competition inside <b>coalition</b> <b>governments</b> induces higher spending than under single party governments.

5|$|On 22 June 1982, {{leaders of}} the three {{organizations}} formalized the formation of their <b>coalition</b> <b>government</b> by signing a Thai-sponsored agreement which established the <b>Coalition</b> <b>Government</b> of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK). Accordingly, the CGDK’s Inner Cabinet consisted of Sihanouk as the President of Democratic Kampuchea, Khieu Samphan as the Vice-President in charge of foreign affairs and Son Sann as Prime Minister. Below the Inner Cabinet were six separate committees responsible for national defence, economy and finance, social affairs and public health, military affairs and the media. During a meeting between Kim Il-sung and Sihanouk on 10 April 1986, in Pyongyang, Kim Il-Sung had reassured Sihanouk that North Korea would continue to regard him as the legitimate head of state of Kampuchea. By 1987, Democratic Kampuchea still held its membership at the UN General Assembly, even though it lacked four criteria of statehood: people, territory, government and supreme authority within the borders of a country. In spite of those limitations, forces of the three armed factions within the CGDK continued to fight the Vietnamese to achieve their objective of “bring about {{the implementation of the}} International Conference on Cambodia and other relevant UN General Assembly resolutions”.|$|E
