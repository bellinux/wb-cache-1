40|$|Abstract. <b>Crowd</b> {{behavior}} {{recognition is}} becoming an important research topic in video surveillance for public places. In this paper, we first discuss the <b>crowd</b> feature selection and extraction and propose a multiple-frame feature point detection and tracking based on the KLT tracker. We state that behavior modelling of <b>crowd</b> is usually coarse compared to that for individuals. Instead of developing general <b>crowd</b> behavior models, we propose to model <b>crowd</b> events for specific end-user scenarios. As a result, a same type of event may be modelled slightly differently from one scenario to another and several models are to be defined. Consequently, fast modelling is required and this is enabled {{by the use of}} an extended Scenario Recognition Engine (SRE) in our approach. <b>Crowd</b> event models are defined; particularly, composite events accommodating evidence accumulation allow to increase detection reliability. Tests have been conducted on real surveillance video sequences containing <b>crowd</b> scenes. The <b>crowd</b> tracking algorithm proves to be robust and gives reliable <b>crowd</b> motion vectors. The <b>crowd</b> event detection on real sequences gives reliable results of a few common <b>crowd</b> behaviors by simple dedicated models.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, a wide {{attention}} has been paid to the <b>crowd</b> control and management in intelligent video surveillance area. Among the tasks of automatic video-based <b>crowd</b> management, <b>crowd</b> motion modeling is recognized as one of the most critical components, since it lays a crucial foundation for numerous subsequent analyses. However, it still encounters many unsolved challenges due to occlusions among pedestrians, complicated motion patterns in <b>crowded</b> scenarios, and so forth. Addressing these issues, we propose a novel spatiotemporal Weber field, which integrates both appearance characteristics and stimulus of <b>crowd</b> motion patterns, to recognize the large-scale <b>crowd</b> event. On the one hand, <b>crowd</b> motion is recognized as variations of spatiotemporal signal, and we then measure the variation based on Weber law.
