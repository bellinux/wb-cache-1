YouTube also asked Madonna's representative to upload a more PG-rated version. Madonna later commented, [...] "What's wrong with... what grinding? I'm {{supposed to be a}} 'girl gone wild' in the video—how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> wild and not grind? This is the question that people should be asking." [...] During her interview with Jimmy Fallon on Facebook, Madonna jokingly confessed that if she were president, [...] "There would be no restrictions whatsoever on any of my videos, ever".

2500|$|In November 1948, a tiny {{cancerous}} lump {{was found}} on Ramana's arm and was removed in February 1949 by the ashram's doctor. Soon, another growth appeared, and another operation was performed by an eminent surgeon in March 1949 with radium applied. The doctor told Ramana that a complete amputation of the arm to the shoulder was required to save his life, but he refused. A third and fourth operation were performed in August and December 1949, but only weakened him. Other systems of medicine were then tried; all proved fruitless and were stopped {{by the end of}} March when devotees gave up all hope. To devotees who begged him to cure himself {{for the sake of his}} followers, Ramana is said to have replied, [...] "Why are you so attached to this body? Let it go," [...] and [...] "Where <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>go?</b> I am here." [...] By April 1950, Ramana was too weak to go to the hall and visiting hours were limited. Visitors would file past the small room where he spent his last days to get one final glimpse. He died on 14 April 1950 at 8:47p.m. At the same time a shooting star was seen, which impressed some of his devotees as a synchronicity.|$|E
