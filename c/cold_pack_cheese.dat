40|$|A {{field study}} with follow up {{investigations}} sought to: 1) determine whether <b>cold</b> <b>packs</b> (over-the-counter symptomtic treatments), coupled with in-office education, improve antibiotic-related knowledge, {{attitudes and behaviors}} more than in-office education alone in patient populations with high percentages of Asian Americans and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders; 2) identify possible reasons for intervention outcomes as described by physicians {{who participated in the}} field study; and 3) explore potential future directions based on a large sample survey of physicians in the field study's highly ethnic county. The intervention resulted in a pre- to post-consultation decrease in perceived need for and an increase in knowledge about antibiotic risks but had no impact on frequency of reported receipt of an antibiotic prescription. Unexpectedly, in-office education alone was more effective in increasing knowledge than in-office education plus the <b>cold</b> <b>pack.</b> In-depth interviews of field study physicians and a large scale physician survey suggest that <b>cold</b> <b>pack</b> interventions targeting patient populations with high percentages of Asian Americans and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders {{may be more likely to}} succeed if accompanied by mass public education regarding risks and physician training regarding effective ways to talk to patients.

40|$|Though <b>cold</b> <b>pack</b> {{is often}} {{made use of}} at home {{as well as at}} {{hospitals}} to reduce fever, {{it can be said that}} evidence showing that it is effective has not been reported. The purpose of this paper is to argue for the usefulness of <b>cold</b> <b>pack</b> in nursing and explore its effective application, presenting empirical data about how <b>cold</b> <b>pack</b> changes body temperature and affects sensation of coldness. Cooperated by healthy females, two types of <b>cold</b> <b>pack</b> treatments, that is, application of the ice pillow to the back part of the head and application of the ice bag to the bilateral axillary[?], were performed. In this experiment, the skin and deep temperatures of all subjects were measured and they were also asked to tell us how cold they felt. The result was that whereas both of the methods made the skin temperature go down alike, they showed a meaningful difference in effect of changing of the deep temperature, indicating that application of the ice bag to the bilateral axillary was more effective in falling the deep temerature. It was also shown that the use of the ice bag made subjects feel colder. The results thus seem to suggest that we feel more comfortable with the ice pillow applied to the back part of the head and that application of the ice bag to the bilateral axillary is more effective in falling body temperature...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} {{compared}} {{the effect of}} quadriceps and hamstring muscle cooling on standing balance in healthy young men. Methods: Thirty healthy young men (18 - 30 years) participated in the study. The participants {{were randomly assigned to}} three groups (n= 10 each) : quadriceps cooling (QC), hamstring cooling (HC), or control group (no cooling). Participants in the QC and HC groups received 20 minutes of cooling using a <b>cold</b> <b>pack</b> (gel pack), placed on the anterior thigh (from the apex of the patella to the mid-thigh) and the posterior thigh (from the base of the popliteal fossa to the mid-thigh), respectively. Balance score including unilateral stance was measured at baseline and immediately after the application of the <b>cold</b> <b>pack.</b> Results: No significant difference in the balance score was noted in any group after the application of the <b>cold</b> <b>pack</b> (p> 0. 05). Similarly, no significant differences in post-test balance score were noted among the three groups (p> 0. 05). Conclusions: Cooling of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles has no immediate effect on standing balance in healthy young men. However, longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate the long-term effects of cooling these muscles on standing balance...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} results of three high-powered, {{independent}} replications of Study 2 from Williams and Bargh (2008). Participants evaluated hot or <b>cold</b> instant therapeutic <b>packs</b> before choosing a reward for participation that was framed as a prosocial (i. e., treat for a friend) or self-interested reward (i. e., treat for the self). Williams and Bargh predicted that evaluating the hot pack {{would lead to a}} higher probability of making a prosocial choice compared to evaluating the <b>cold</b> <b>pack.</b> We did not replicate the effect in any individual laboratory or when considering {{the results of}} the three replications together (total N = 861). We conclude that {{there is no evidence that}} brief exposure to warm therapeutic packs induces greater prosocial responding than exposure to <b>cold</b> therapeutic <b>packs...</b>|$|R
50|$|An instant <b>cold</b> <b>pack</b> is {{a device}} that {{consists}} of two bags; one containing water, inside a bag containing ammonium nitrate, calcium ammonium nitrate or urea. When the inner bag of water is broken by squeezing the package, it is allowed to dissolve the solid in an endothermic reaction. This reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings, quickly lowering the pack's temperature.|$|R
5000|$|Ammonium nitrate {{is used in}} some instant <b>cold</b> <b>packs,</b> as its {{dissolution}} {{in water}} is highly endothermic.

30|$|If the {{sufferer}} had {{knowledge of}} specific skills, they sometimes asked their relatives for assistance {{as described in}} the subcategory “support with skills”. Skills used were diverse. Some sufferers instructed their relatives to place a <b>cold</b> <b>pack</b> on their neck if they were dissociating, while others helped them to inhale an aroma therapy mixture. Often porcupine balls were used to deal with stressful situations. Prior to the assistance, relatives were informed where to find specific items, for example the <b>cold</b> <b>pack,</b> aroma therapy mixture, or massage tools, such as porcupine ball. Moreover, sometimes relatives also helped with taking medication, such as reminding the sufferer to take it or giving emergency medication during stressful situations. Relatives were required as an anchor to reality, for instance helping the sufferer to focus on their environment and to describe what they perceive around them. Likewise, relatives helped during a crisis to escort them out through a crowd.|$|R

40|$|The {{activity}} of antidromically identified supraoptic neurosecretory neurones {{was recorded in}} Sprague-Dawley rats under urethane or sodium pentobarbitone anaesthesia during cooling of the body with a <b>cold</b> <b>pack.</b> Of twelve phasic neurones studied during a complete cooling and rewarming cycle, six displayed an initial increase, followed by a depression in activity {{during the period of}} reduced body temperature. The remaining six phasic neurones did not alter their activity during cooling. Non-phasic neurohypophysial neurones displayed a reversible reduction (n = 8), or increase (n = 6) in activity during cooling, while seven neurones were unaffected by changes in body temperature. In four other anaesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats, urine flow was reduced by approximately 50 % during cooling; this was followed by a diuresis after removal of the <b>cold</b> <b>pack</b> and return of body temperature to normal. The antidiuresis did not occur in homozygous Brattleboro rats which lack arginine vasopressin. The electrophysiological data from a proportion of the supraoptic neurohypophysial neurones correlate with the observed changes in urine flow...|$|R
40|$|Effect of {{packaging}} {{systems on}} the quality and shelf-life of the Rokpol type mould cheese from goat milk The material for experiments comprised 4 batches of the Rokpol type mould cheese manufactured at 25 -day intervals. The raw material used to manufacture the cheese was goat milk of extra class (TBC- total bacterial count – less than 100 x 103 /cm 3 and number of somatic cells- 400 x 103 /cm 3). The experimental Rokpol <b>cheese</b> was <b>packed</b> in aluminium foil {{as well as in}} modified atmosphere and in vacuum. The packaging material used to <b>pack</b> <b>cheeses</b> in the modified atmosphere was a barrier foil (oriented polyethylene polyamide). The performed microbiological investigations revealed that, in the case of packaging of the experimental cheese in aluminium foil, proliferation of the coli type of bacteria occurred. In the remaining <b>cheeses</b> <b>packed</b> in the modified atmosphere, the number of bacteria from the coli group remained stable from the moment of their production until the end of their shelf-life, irrespective of the type of the applied gas mixture. The performed organoleptic evaluation showed that <b>cheeses</b> <b>packed</b> in the aluminium foil were characterised by highest consumer overall acceptability...|$|R
