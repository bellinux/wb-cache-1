40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{determine}} if calcium cross-linking of pectin in the pit membrane of xylem parenchyma restricts water movement which results in deep supercooling. <b>Current</b> <b>year</b> <b>shoots</b> of `Loring' peach (Prunus persica) were infiltrated with oxalic acid or EGTA solutions for 24 or 48 hours and then either prepared for ultrastructural analysis or subjected to differential thermal analysis. The effect of 0. 25 to 1. 0 % pectinase (weight/volume) on deep supercooling was also investigated. The use of 5 to 50 millimolar oxalic acid and pectinase resulted in a significant reduction (flattening) of the low temperature exotherm and a distinct swelling and partial degradation of the pit membrane. EGTA (10 millimolar) for 24 or 48 hours shifted the low temperature exotherm to warmer temperatures and effected the outermost layer of the pit membrane. A hypothesis is presented on pectin-mediated regulation of deep supercooling of xylem parenchyma...|$|E
40|$|Current theory {{indicates}} that {{the structure of the}} cell wall is integral to the ability of a tissue to exhibit deep supercooling. Our previous work has indicated that the structure of the pit membrane and/or amorphous layer (protective layer), rather than the entire cell wall, may {{play a major role in}} deep supercooling (21, 22). The present study indicates a shift in the low-temperature-exotherm of <b>current</b> <b>year</b> <b>shoots</b> of peach can be induced by soaking twigs in water over 3 to 10 days. Alternatively, these shifts can be inhibited by exposing tissues to 10 − 4 molar cycloheximide. Ultrastructural observations indicated a marked alteration of the amorphous layer in xylem parenchyma of water-soaked tissue. Alterations consisted of an apparent loosening or partial dissolution of portions of the amorphous layer. Changes in the density or uniformity of the amorphous layer in cycloheximide-treated tissues were not as readily apparent. The appearance of the protoplast in tissue soaked in water for up to 10 days was characteristic of deacclimated cells. However, in tissue soaked in cycloheximide for the same period these changes were not evident. These observations further support our contention that the structure of the amorphous layer may play a key role in establishing and regulating the ability of a cell to exhibit deep supercooling...|$|E
40|$|Biomass {{allocation}} {{and growth}} by the clonal plant Acaena magellanica were characterized for three populations grazed by introduced reindeer on the subantarctic island of South Georgia. Annual growth markers (internode lengths) {{were used to}} divide each rhizome into <b>current</b> <b>year's</b> <b>shoots,</b> one-year-old and two-year-old rhizome segments. Total dry weights were significantly smaller in grazed than in ungrazed populations. Leaf biomass of <b>current</b> <b>year's</b> <b>shoots</b> was very much lower in grazed shoots. Rhizome length and number of leaves were less affected than dry weight by grazing, and the reindeer grazing thus seems to mainly influence biomass accumulation rather than morphology in Acaena. Interactions with Festuca contracta in both grazed and ungrazed areas were also studied in a two-year competition experiment. No apparent release of soil resources (as measured {{by an increase in}} plant growth) was apparent in plots where Festuca was removed, but the <b>current</b> <b>year's</b> <b>shoots</b> of Acaena were smaller and more numerous in these plots than in controls, especially in the ungrazed area...|$|R

40|$|NO 2 enters spruce needles by gas {{exchange}} through the slomata. Nitrate formed from NO 2 is reduced in the cytosol by nitrate reductase (NR), the {{rate limiting enzyme}} of the nitrogen assimilatory pathway. A linear relationship {{was found between the}} nitrate reductase activity (NRA), NO 2 concentration and the amount of N incorporated into amino acids and proteins, so that NRA was suggested as an estimate of NO 2 -uptake. In the present field study, 50 spruce trees (Picea abies) have been selected, which grow in a natural habitat in a NO 2 concentration gradient in a forest crossed by a highway which is a major NO source. At part of the sites, the microclimatic conditions have been recorded, so that common models of local {{gas exchange}} of the needles could be used to estimate stomatal uptake of NO 2. NRA was investigated as a function of radiation and stomatal uptake on the day before needle sampling. Close to the highway NRA was permanently elevated with a maximum in summer. As with the laboratory results, a linear relationship between stomatal uptake and NRA was found. Total N — content of <b>current</b> <b>year</b> <b>shoots</b> was not affected by the additional N-source provided by airborne NO 2. The present study shows that the gas exchange models are consistent with the physiological reactions of spruce needles on a local level and therefore contribute to the validation of calculations of NO 2 dry deposition to spruce forests...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Drimys brasiliensis Miers is an Angiosperm {{native to}} the Atlantic Rainforest, {{commonly}} known as cataia. Because of dormancy of its seeds, due to embryonic immaturity, production of cataia seedlings presents challenges regarding propagation of the species. Thus, cuttings emerged as a possible technique to be applied, diminishing plants production time and ensuring uniformity of rooting. Stem cuttings from <b>current</b> <b>year</b> <b>shoots</b> were collected in autumn/ 2012, prepared with 10 - 12 cm in length, a bevel cut on base and straight on top, keeping two leaves, one leaf or no leaves in the apical portion. After disinfestation, bases of cuttings were submitted to the following treatments with indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) in 50 % hydro-alcoholic solution: 100 % water, 0, 500, 1500, 3000, 4500 and 6000 mg L- 1 IBA. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with 3 types of cutting x 7 IBA concentrations, with four replicates of 10 cuttings per experimental unit. After 120 days, the variables percentage of rooted cuttings, number of roots per cutting, length of the three longest roots per cutting, percentage of cuttings with callus, alive and dead, with new shoots and the cuttings maintaining the original leaves were assessed. The application of IBA had no influence {{on any of the}} assessed variables. Cuttings with two leaves presented the best rooting percentage (51. 1 %) and the lowest mortality (5. 4 %), when compared to cuttings with one leaf (35. 0 %) or without leaves (0. 4 %).

40|$|Sphaeropsis sapinea is a {{cosmopolitan}} fungus, identified {{in more than}} 50 countries of the world, on all continents, but it is primarily the species of warm lands. It is also a polyphagous fungus recorded from 11 coniferous genera. The most endangered and the most frequent host plants are Pinus species - it occurs on 48 pine species, among which the most susceptible are Pinus Radiata, P. nigra, P. sylvestris, P. ponderosa, P. resinosa, P. mugo, P. pinaster and P. elliotti. The greatest damage is caused on the introduced Pinus species and on those cultivated in artificial plantations, shelterbelts and in urban environments. In Yugoslavia S. sapinea is widely distributed both in the continental and in the Mediterranean parts. It was identified from ten pine species and six hosts from other coniferous genera. By the study in our country, the new hosts of this fungus were detected - Pinus jeffrey, P. peuce and P. heldreichii. The most endangered species in our country is Austrian pine, both in urban environments, and in plantations The symptoms of the disease are bud wilt, curling, stunting and necrosis of <b>current</b> <b>year</b> <b>shoots</b> and needles, dieback of top shoots, parts of crown or tree tops, branch and stem bark canker, root collar rot on the young plants in nurseries and their dying. This fungus also prevents seed germination of Pinus species and causes blue sap stain of the freshly cut wood, although sap stain was also observed on standing trees. More rarely it causes root rot and crown wilt of Pinus species. The main symptoms of infection, both of young plants and older trees, are the dieback of <b>current</b> <b>year</b> <b>shoots</b> S. sapinea can penetrate through buds, bark of young shoots and needles. The critical time of infection is the period from mid April to mid May. Then infection mainly penetrates through the bark of young shoots, which results in their dying. Infection through the needles occurs mainly {{at the time of}} their sudden growth or during summer months. The first visible symptoms of infection of the young shoots are in the form of brown necroses, resin bleeding and several short pairs of needles at the place. S. sapinea can infect male and female flowers, current year and second-year cones. The pycnidia with mature conidia can form on the shoots, needles, first-year and second-year cones during the year of infection. The first mature fructifications are mostly formed in the bark of young shoots, in the zone of infection, and they were recorded in late June at the earliest. They were recorded on the cones at the beginning of the third decade of July. Pycnidia are formed in the bark, on the needles and on the second-year and older cones, on male and female flowers, as well as on the cones in the first year of development. The size of S. sapinea conidia on different Pinus species is very variable throughout the world and ranges widely from 16. 8 - 55. 0 × 7. 0 - 21. 0 m. Our study shows that the size of pycnospores in our country is also variable and it ranges 14. 8 - 51. 4 × 9. 7 - 20. 2 m The optimal temperature for spore germination and germ tube growth is 27 °C, and the optimal temperature for mycelial growth on the media PDA and MEA is 28 °C. The formation of fruiting bodies in the culture is affected by light and the presence of sterilised needles on the mycelium The correct and timely control measures can contribute to reduce the consequences of this serious disease, by the combined application of silvicultural and chemical measures. Chemical control is recommended in the nurseries, severely infected plantations and in urban environments.

Originated from <b>current</b> <b>year</b> <b>shoots</b> in autumn/ 2011, spring/ 2011 and summer/ 2012, two types of cuttings were prepared: one about 10 - 12 cm long, with bevel cut on the base and straight at the apex, with two leaves reduced to an area of 78. 5 cm²; the other with the same specifications, with leaves completely removed. After disinfection, base of the cuttings was treated with IBA (0, 500, 1. 000, 1. 500 and 2. 000 mg L- 1). Planting was made in tubes of 110 cm³, with medium size vermiculite particles and carbonized rice hull (1 : 1) and installed in a greenhouse with intermittent mist.

40|$|In boreal forests, {{the main}} factors {{limiting}} biomass production are the harsh climate, which combines a short growing season and low annual levels of incoming solar energy, {{and the limited}} availability of nitrogen. These limitations will be directly affected by climate change, and may in turn substantially affect the carbon budget of the boreal forests, the production of wood and biofuel, biodiversity and other ecosystem services. This thesis addresses the {{effects of climate change}} on the rate of carbon assimilation by boreal Norway spruce, Picea abies (L.) Karst. The study focussed on examining how the mechanisms regulating uptake of CO 2 in mature, field-grown trees are affected by exposure to elevated concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide [CO 2] and air temperature. The experiment was conducted at the Flakaliden research site in northern Sweden. Twelve whole-tree chambers (WTCs) were used to impose combinations of [CO 2] and temperature treatments as predicted for the region in the <b>year</b> 2100. <b>Shoot</b> CO 2 gas exchange was measured continuously within the chambers, using shoot cuvettes. The effect of the climate change treatments on developing shoots was studied during their first growing season; the effect of the treatments on spring recovery and annual photosynthetic performance in 1 -year old shoots was also examined. The elevated temperature induced an earlier start and completion of the structural development of the <b>current</b> <b>year’s</b> <b>shoots,</b> as well as an earlier shift from negative to positive net carbon assimilation rate (NAR) by one to three weeks. The elevated CO 2 increased photosynthetic performance by 30 % in high season. Consequently, the <b>current</b> <b>year’s</b> <b>shoots</b> had assimilated their own mass in carbon 20 - 30 days earlier under the climate change conditions than under the current climatic conditions. For the 1 -year old shoots, an increase in the maximum photosynthetic rate of ~ 50 % was recorded, and the spring recovery of photosynthetic capacity was completed three to four weeks earlier than under the current climatic conditions. Multiple environmental variables constantly affect the NAR. A model incorporating the most important variables – light, temperature and vapour pressure deficit – was fitted to the data from the 1 -year old shoots. This linked changes in the carbon assimilation rate to each of the tested variables. An artificial neural network was used to reduce the noise present in the field data, and to benchmark the performance of the model. The climate change treatment increased the temperature optimum for gross carbon assimilation from 19. 7 to 24. 7 °C, and the model apparent quantum yield increased from 0. 042 to 0. 077 mol mol- 1. In total, the annual gross carbon uptake increased by 84 %, compared to that under current conditions. The lengthening of the growing season increased annual gross carbon uptake by 22 %. Finally, the influence of canopy processes on the rate of soil respiration and its carbon isotope signal (δ 13 C) were investigated. The results indicated that canopy processes are likely to have a considerable influence on soil respiration rates, and it is suggested that ecosystem carbon balance models should include plant root allocation and aboveground productivity as driving variables with respect to soil respiration and carbon sequestration...|$|R

Four Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) trees were destructively sampled and {{were divided into two}} groups: high-density group and low-density group. First, the effects of density on organ dimensions and on organ relative mass were analysed based on experimental measurements. These were primary indicators of the plant response to competition.

The quality of the fitting is finally validated using data of individual organ mass at shoot level for the sampled branches. The Mann-Whitney Student's t test showed that there were significant differences between the shoot attributes of the two groups for shoot diameter, shoot biomass and needle biomass.

40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the effect of twig (<b>current</b> <b>year</b> <b>shoot)</b> size on seed size variation and to test whether a seed size vs number tradeoff occurs for the twigs of subtropical broad-leaved species. Fruit-bearing twigs were sampled for 55 woody species (including 33 evergreen and 22 deciduous dicot species) from a southwest Chinese forest. Twig size, fruit size and number, and seed size and number were measured for each species. The relationships among these functional traits were determined both across species and across correlated phyletic divergences. Total fruit mass and total seed mass were positively correlated with twig size. Seed size was positively associated with fruit size, which was, in turn, positively correlated with twig diameter, but negatively correlated with the ratio of twig length to diameter. The effect of twig size on seed size variation was not significant, possibly {{as a result of the}} large variation in seed number per fruit. Cross-species and across-phyletic divergence analyses revealed that seed size was negatively and isometrically correlated with seed number per twig mass in both the evergreen and deciduous species groupings, demonstrating the existence of tradeoff between seed size and number.

Half of the saplings were harvested after the exposure, and {{the second half of}} the saplings were left in the pots in open field until next autumn. The reaction of the saplings of different timing of bud burst was also investigated. The terminal shoot length and the total <b>current</b> <b>year</b> <b>shoot</b> length of Norway spruce saplings after one month of ozone fumigation were significantly (p < 0. 05) suppressed in all the treatments comparing to the control saplings. The needles of saplings fumigated with ozone were smaller than the needles of control saplings. No significant changes of the biomass of different fractions of Norway spruce saplings were determined right after the fumigation, as well as, in 14 month after the cessation of the fumigation. Norway spruce saplings of early and late timing of bud burst reacted differently to ozone fumigation during the active growth period. The formation of new needles and shoots of the saplings of late bud burst stage was more suppressed comparing to the saplings of the early bud burst stage.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} study we analyze the fate of {{airborne}} nitrogen in heathland ecosystems (NW Germany) {{by means of a}} 15 N tracer experiment. Our objective was to quantify N sequestration and N allocation patterns in an ecosystem that is naturally limited by N, but that has been exposed to airborne N inputs exceeding critical loads for more than 3 decades. We hypothesized that the system has a tendency towards N saturation, which should be indicated by low N sequestration and high N leaching. We analyzed 15 N partitioning (aboveground biomass and soil horizons) and investigated 15 N leaching over 2 years following a 15 N tracer pulse addition. 15 N tracer recovery was 90 % and 76 % in the first and second year, respectively. Contrary to our expectations, more than 99 % of the tracer recovered was sequestered in the biomass and soil, while leaching losses were < 0. 05 % after 2 years. Mosses were the most important short-term sink for 15 N (64 % recovery in the first year), followed by the organic layer. In the second year, the moss layer developed from a sink to a source (23 % losses), and soil compartments were the most important sink (gains of 11. 2 % in 2008). Low 15 N tracer recovery in the <b>current</b> <b>year's</b> <b>shoots</b> of Calluna vulgaris (< 2 %) indicated minor availability of 15 N tracer sequestered in the organic layer. N partitioning patterns showed that the investigated heaths still have conservative N cycling, even after several decades of high N loads. This finding is mainly attributable to the high immobilization capacities for N of podzols in soil compartments. In the long term, the podzol-A- and B-horizons in particular may immobilize considerable amounts of incoming N. Since N compounds of these horizons are not readily bio-available, podzols have a high potential to withdraw airborne N from the system's N cycle...|$|R

Intensively growing shoots modified the dry matter partitioning: during shoot growth {{the proportion of}} roots decreased but after that it increased. Based on their large proportion of dry matter, the needles (excluding current needles) were the strongest sink of carbon containing 40 % of the incorporated 14 C. Despite their small initial sink size, the elongating shoots (current main shoot + current branch) and their needles were the second strongest sink (30 – 40 % of the total 14 C) which reflects their high physiological activity.

50|$|Every year, a main rhizome {{produces}} {{only one}} aerial shoot, {{but in the}} case of a plant with multiple main rhizomes a new shoot is produced from each. The age of a shoot corresponds to the layers of compressed microphylls in its stem, caused by growth halting each winter, the same way as tree rings are formed. Shoot morphology can also be used to estimate their ages. First <b>year</b> <b>shoots</b> are unbranched and usually do not penetrate the soil surface. Second <b>year</b> <b>shoots</b> undergo rapid growth, usually reaching near their final heights, and forming several systems of lateral branches. Branching occurs only in the second, and sometimes third years. Strobili can be formed as early as the second growing season, but usually begin to be produced in the third. Strobilus production can continue through the fourth <b>year,</b> and <b>shoots</b> die in either the fourth or fifth year.|$|R
