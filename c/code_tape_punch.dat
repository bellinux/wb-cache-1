50|$|The BRPE <b>tape</b> <b>punches</b> {{operate at}} 110 {{characters}} per second, with two adjustable-level versions for reading either 5 or 8-level paper tape or 6, 7 or 8-level paper tape. A fixed-level 6-level paper <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> was also available. All BRPE version paper <b>tape</b> <b>punches</b> were packaged for table-top use {{and have a}} parallel contact interface which is wired directly to the punch electromagnetic coils.|$|R
50|$|The Model 28 <b>Tape</b> <b>Punches,</b> {{also known}} as a tape perforators, are receiving-only five-level devices that is {{actuated}} by incoming line signals and perforates standard 11/16 inch paper <b>tape.</b> These <b>tape</b> <b>punches</b> are self-contained and motor-driven, operating at speeds up to 100 words-per-minute. The Model 28 family of <b>tape</b> <b>punches</b> includes the non-typing perforator (LPE), typing perforator (LTPE), non-typing reperforator (LRPE) and typing reperforator (LPR).|$|R
50|$|Four {{different}} <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> {{units are}} available for use with the Model 28 ASR. These are the non-typing perforator (LPE), typing perforator (LTPE), non-typing reperforator (LRPE) and typing reperforator (LPR). Similarly, there are four different tape reader options. These are the fixed head single contact transmitter-distributor (LXD), pivoted head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LAXD), fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LBXD) and pivoted and fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LCXD). There is also an option that installs a second <b>tape</b> <b>punch,</b> usually a typing reperforator (LPR) under the dome just behind the tape reader. The second <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> is driven by its own motor.|$|R

50|$|The only input was a {{paper tape}} reader {{and the only}} outputs were the console printer and paper <b>tape</b> <b>punch.</b> As the paper <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> was much faster than the printer, most output was punched, and then listed on an {{off-line}} printer.

50|$|A {{paper tape}} reader, the IBM 2671, was {{introduced}} in 1964. It had a rated speed of 1,000 cps. There were also a paper tape reader and paper <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> from an earlier era, available only as RPQs (Request Price Quotation). The 1054 (reader) and 1055 (punch), which were carried forward (like the 1052 console typewriter) from the IBM 1050 Teleprocessing System. All these devices operated at a maximum of 15.5 characters per second. The paper <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> from the IBM 1080 System was also available by RPQ, but at a prohibitively expensive price.|$|R
50|$|Some other {{examples}} of secondary storage technologies are flash memory (e.g. USB flash drives or keys), floppy disks, magnetic <b>tape,</b> paper <b>tape,</b> <b>punched</b> cards, standalone RAM disks, and Iomega Zip drives.|$|R
50|$|While {{there was}} an {{optional}} high-speed paper <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> (the PTP-1 at 60 digits per second) for output, the standard punch operated at 17 hex characters per second (510 bytes per minute).|$|R
50|$|Single Character - The single {{character}} output provides four-bit characters {{suitable for}} typewriter, <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> or other similar output equipment. A parity check bit and two timing bits are issued automatically with each character.|$|R
50|$|The {{computers}} {{were connected to}} data channels coming from the wind tunnels and the engine facility. There were five typewriters for printed output, five paper <b>tape</b> <b>punches,</b> and four pen plotters to produce graphs.|$|R
50|$|In 1948, Western Union {{introduced}} Plan 55-A, {{the first}} automatic electromechanical {{store and forward}} message switching system. All message storage was performed by paper <b>tape</b> <b>punches</b> paired with paper tape readers, with a bin in between.|$|R
50|$|A {{range of}} {{peripherals}} was available, including 80-column card punches and readers, 8 track paper <b>tape</b> <b>punches</b> and readers and solid barrel line printers. Data could be stored on half-inch magnetic tape. Magnetic disk storage became available in 1966.|$|R
50|$|In some {{electromechanical}} {{offices in}} the 1970s, the paper <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> recorders were replaced by magnetic <b>tape</b> recorders. Most <b>punches</b> remained in service until the exchange switch itself was replaced by more advanced systems. Stored program control exchanges, having computers anyway, do not need separate AMA equipment. They sent magnetic tapes to the Accounting Center until approximately 1990, when data links took over this job.|$|R

A less-common tape reader had a four-position START/AUTO/STOP/FREE lever. In the AUTO position {{it could be}} commanded on and off remotely. The <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> is the unit directly behind the reader. As it exits the machine, the tape passes under a triangular lip that allows the tape to be easily torn by lifting against the sharp edge of the lip.|$|R

50|$|The {{architecture}} has {{a simple}} programmed I/O bus, plus a DMA channel.The programmed I/O bus typically runs low to medium-speed peripherals, such as printers,teletypes, paper <b>tape</b> <b>punches</b> and readers, while DMA {{is used for}} cathode ray tubescreens with a light pen, analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters,tape drives, disk drives.|$|R
50|$|The {{first pass}} {{of the source}} tape through the tape reader was {{generally}} used just for checking for syntax errors in the program, so the generation of the object tape from the <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> would be suppressed. If any errors or warnings were detected, {{it would be necessary}} to load the Minisystem tape again, and to run the editor program to make the corrections, and to generate {{a new version of the}} source tape. Otherwise, the source tape could be wound up again, and loaded back into the tape reader for a second pass. This time, it would be read in, haltingly, whilst the paper <b>tape</b> <b>punch</b> worked flat-out to produce the corresponding object tape (usually two or three times longer in length than the Fortran source tape).|$|R
