5000|$|...GT {{would be}} a {{co-sponsor}} when he raced with Shimano. The frame fork and handlebars were of GT manufacture while Shimano provided the major components such as the caliper brakes pedals, cranks, <b>chainwheels,</b> sprockets etc.|$|E
50|$|Bicycle cranks have dead centres at {{approximately}} 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock where simple pushing {{down of the}} pedal will not turn the <b>chainwheel,</b> but the rider's leg is able to apply tangential force at the pedal to overcome it. Fixed-gear bicycles (without a freehub) use {{the momentum of the}} bicycle and rider to keep the <b>chainwheel</b> turning even if the rider makes no attempt to pedal in a circular motion.|$|R
50|$|Renthal also {{produces}} chains, sprockets and grips. The Intellilever unbreakable clutch and brake levers for motocross bikes along with brake pads were added in 2008. Also new is a hybrid bi-metal rear sprocket called the Twinring Rear <b>Chainwheel</b> which utilizes an aluminium centre section mated with a steel outer ring. By combining these two materials, the <b>chainwheel</b> is lighter than an all-steel construction but is more durable {{than the traditional}} all aluminium rear sprocket.|$|R
50|$|Schlumpf Drives are {{primarily}} {{used as an}} alternative to multiple chainrings. Four models are currently produced, with differing ratios from pedal revolutions to <b>chainwheel</b> revolutions.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{resurgence}} in domestic and export demand for pedal bicycles and by February 1932 Raleigh had acquired all the Humber Limited trade marks. Manufacture {{was transferred to}} Raleigh's Nottingham works. Raleigh-made Humbers differed from Raleighs only in <b>chainwheels,</b> fork crowns and some brakework.|$|E
50|$|Renthal is a UK {{manufacturer}} and designer of motorcycle accessories, including handlebars, <b>chainwheels,</b> grips {{and other items}} for the off-road, street, and ATV markets. Honda, Kawasaki, KTM, and Suzuki specify Renthal handlebars as standard for their performance off-road motorcycles. Renthal's manufacturing and engineering facility is located in Bredbury, near Manchester in England.|$|E
50|$|The bikes Engers rode pioneered {{lightweight}} techniques, frequently featuring drilled out brakes, <b>chainwheels</b> {{and other}} components. The bikes were often {{designed and built}} by his friend and mentor, the late Alan Shorter. It was not uncommon for Engers {{to arrive at a}} morning event with a Shorter bicycle frame built the previous night and thus unpainted.|$|E
25|$|As {{there is}} no <b>chainwheel</b> on a unicycle, both right and left cranks are identical, except for the pedal {{attachment}} thread in the left-hand crank, which is reverse threaded.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{important}} that the <b>chainwheel</b> match the chain size (i.e. the link pitch) closely. Even a small difference in link size or consistency can cause undue wear on the <b>chainwheel</b> and/or cause the chain to jump off the windlass when the winch is operating, particularly during payout, a runaway condition sometimes referred to as [...] "water spouting" [...] should it occur at high speed. Nowadays, especially on large tankers and cruise ships, the windlass may be split into independent port and starboard units. In these cases they are frequently coupled with warping drums (as distinct from warping heads). In some of these the warping drums are of the self tensioning or constant tension type.|$|R
50|$|The {{wheels on}} either a {{vertical}} or horizontal windlass provide for either chain or line to be engaged. The wheel for line is termed a warping head, while the chain handling wheel is variously {{referred to as}} the gypsy (in the UK) or wildcat (in North America). For clarity in communication the generic term <b>chainwheel</b> is often used. On small craft a warping drum is sometimes used to handle both chain & rope, although particular care must be taken with sizing and compatibility of line, chain, and windlass, for this feature to work effectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{crankset}} (in the US) or chainset (in the UK), is {{the component}} of a bicycle drivetrain that converts the reciprocating motion of the rider's legs into rotational motion used to drive the chain or belt, which in turn drives the rear wheel. It consists {{of one or more}} sprockets, also called chainringsor <b>chainwheels</b> attached to the cranks, arms, or crankarms to which the pedals attach. It is connected to the rider by the pedals, to the bicycle frame by the bottom bracket, and to the rear sprocket, cassette or freewheel via the chain.|$|E
5000|$|Track cogs are {{generally}} {{available in a}} range of sizes from 12T to 23T (number of teeth) and two different widths - 3/32" [...] and 1/8" [...] (thickness of teeth). The 3/32" [...] size is made to accommodate narrower 3/32" [...] chains, but is also compatible with 1/8" [...] and wider bmx/single speed chains. The thicker 1/8" [...] cogs are ONLY compatible with 1/8" [...] or wider single speed chains. There may be larger (number of teeth) sizes available as well, either custom manufactured or adapted from <b>chainwheels</b> or front sprockets using a number of methods or devices. There are some heavy duty 3/16" [...] chains designed for BMX use which are compatible with most cogs. However, because these chains usually have taller thicker side plates, they may not work properly with some cogs smaller than 11T or freewheels smaller than 16T.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{elliptical}} chainrings (also called <b>chainwheels</b> or sprockets) {{has gained}} considerable {{interest in the}} amateur and professional cycling community. evertheless, we are unaware of any scientific studies that have examined the performancebenefits of using elliptical chainrings during an actual performance trial. Therefore, {{this study examined the}} influence of elliptical chainring use on physiological and performance parameters during a 10 km cycling time trial. Nine male cyclistscompleted, in a counterbalanced order, three 10 km cycling time trials using either a standard chainring or an elliptical chainring at two distinct settings. An attempt was made to blind the cyclists to the type of chainring used until the completion ofthe study. During the 10 km time trial, power output and heart rate were recorded at a frequency of 1 Hz and RPE was measured at 3, 6, and 8. 5 km. Total power output was not different (P =. 40) between the circular (340 ± 30 W) or eitherelliptical chainring condition (342 ± 29 W and 341 ± 31 W). Similarly, no differences (P =. 73) in 2 km mean power output were observed between conditions. Further, no differences in RPE were observed between conditions measured at 3, 6, and 8. 5 km. Heart rate was significantly greater (P =. 02) using the less aggressive elliptical setting (174 ± 10 bpm) compared with the circular setting (171 ± 9 bpm). Elliptical chainrings do not appear to provide a performance benefit over traditional circular chainrings during a mid-distance time trial...|$|E
5000|$|... "By one {{of those}} telling ironies of eternal {{recurrence}} his riding style has come back into fashion. Switch on any mountain stage these days and the screen fills with our contemporary grimpeurs earnest twiddling upwards. Whether they realise it or not, they've all taken a crank out of Charly's <b>chainwheel.</b> There is a further, rather touching irony attached to {{the identity of the}} rider who has revived this way with inclines. As regards physique and disposition he is far removed from the 'angelic' Luxembourger. Who could he be, this opportune plagiarist, this new twiddler-in-chief? Why, none other that the present king of the hill himself, Lance Armstrong." ...|$|R
50|$|Pedersen {{wrote that}} he {{developed}} the hammock style seat first. It provides suspension from road imperfections with much less weight, 4 oz instead of 3 lb of traditional leather and steel spring saddles of the day. Pedersen then developed a frame, a truss assembled from several thin tubes, around his new seat design. He attributed his inspiration to the Whipple-Murphy bridge truss. The design initially did not support seat height adjustment, and even after some adjustability was added, required the manufacture of eight different sizes. The non-standard frame design would not accommodate a traditional front fork. Instead, Pedersen developed a fork that also consisted of thin tubes assembled into a truss, which {{was attached to the}} frame with bearings at two distinct points, instead of through a traditional head tube. Pedersen also received patents for a <b>chainwheel</b> and bottom bracket combination and lightweight pedals.|$|R
2500|$|Coaster brakes {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being protected from the elements and thus perform well in rain or snow. Though coaster brakes generally go years without needing maintenance, they are more complicated than rim brakes to repair if it becomes necessary, especially the more sophisticated type with expanding brake shoes. Coaster brakes also do not have sufficient heat dissipation for use on long descents, a characteristic made legendary through events such as the 'Repack Downhill' race, where riders almost certainly would need to repack their coaster brakes after the grease melted or smoked due to the heat from lengthy downhill runs. A coaster brake can only be applied when the cranks are reasonably level, limiting how quickly it can be applied. As coaster brakes are only made for rear wheels, they have the disadvantage common to all rear brakes of skidding the wheel easily. This disadvantage may, however, be alleviated if the bicycle also has a hand-lever-operated front brake and the cyclist uses it. Another disadvantage is that the coaster brake is completely dependent on the chain being fully intact and engaged. If the chain breaks or disengages from the <b>chainwheel</b> and/or rear sprocket, the coaster brake provides no braking power whatsoever. [...] Like all hub brakes except disc brakes, a coaster brake requires a reaction arm to be connected to the frame. [...] This may require unbolting when the wheel is removed or moved in its fork ends to adjust chain tension.|$|R
