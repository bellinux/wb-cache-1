Owing to certain natural and Political conditions, it is only when these natural conditions are vanishing and these political ones becoming modified that we fund this vast question thrust upon us and a demand is felt for a solution of the problem before it goes beyond the <b>controlling</b> <b>line.</b> In treating this question, I desire to take up first, a fit of history closely connected with the United States, and to consider the political, economical, moral, and social effects, and try if possible to offer a partial solution to this great question.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{scattering}} in a quantum star graph with a Fülöp [...] Tsutsui coupling in its vertex and with external potentials on the lines. We find certain special couplings {{for which the}} probability of the transmission between two given lines of the graph is strongly influenced by the potential applied on another line. On {{the basis of this}} phenomenon we design a tunable quantum band-pass spectral filter. The transmission from the input to the output line is governed by a potential added on the <b>controlling</b> <b>line.</b> The strength of the potential directly determines the passband position, which allows to control the filter in a macroscopic manner. Generalization of this concept to quantum devices with multiple controlling lines proves possible. It enables the construction of spectral filters with more controllable parameters or with more operation modes. In particular, we design a band-pass filter with independently adjustable multiple passbands. We also address the problem of the physical realization of Fülöp [...] Tsutsui couplings and demonstrate that the couplings needed for the construction of the proposed quantum devices can be approximated by simple graphs carrying only δ potentials.

40|$|Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) {{devices are}} the key to produce {{electrical}} energy economically and environmental friendly in a deregulated market. Implemented through a new equipment consisting high power electronics based technologies, it opens up new opportunities for <b>controlling</b> <b>line</b> power flows, minimizing losses and maintaining bus voltages at desired level in a power system network. In large, interconnected power systems, power system damping is often reduced, leading to lightly damped electromechanical modes of oscillations. Proper controller design and installation of this system becomes essential for control and operation improvement of power systems networks. Three categories of FACTS controllers may be distinguished: Series controllers; Shunt controllers; Combined series-shunt controllers. The location of these devices depends on the amount of local load and through load and from transient stability point of view their location moves towards the sending-end. The optimal location for the device is not in the mid-point of the line but rather, slightly off-center of the transmission line gives better performance for maximum benefit and depends on the line resistance and is linearly increased as R/X ratio of the line is increased. The paper attempted to highlight best location and control strategy for this device that, guarantee security and stability of the power system networks for maximum benefits...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of approaches for synthesis and optimization of reversible circuits received significant {{attention in the}} past. This {{is partly due to}} the increasing emphasis on low power design methodologies, and partly motivated by recent works in quantum computation. While most of them relied on a gate library composed of multiple-control Toffoli (MCT) gates with positive <b>control</b> <b>lines,</b> some initial works also exist which additionally incorporate negative <b>control</b> <b>lines.</b> This usually leads to smaller circuits with respect to the number of gates as well as the corresponding quantum costs. However, despite these benefits, negative <b>control</b> <b>lines</b> have hardly been considered in post-synthesis optimization of reversible circuits so far. In this paper, we address this issue. We are presenting an optimization scheme inspired by template matching which explicitly makes use of negative <b>control</b> <b>lines.</b> Experimental evaluations demonstrate that exploiting negative <b>control</b> <b>lines</b> in fact lead to a {{reduction in the number of}} gates and the quantum costs by up to 60 % and 25 %, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{explosion}} of microcontrollers and microprocessor applications {{has led to}} a rapid growth in the area of robotics especially line follower robots. <b>Controlling</b> <b>line</b> follower robots to travel over a complex race course pose some instability and speed problems. This article mainly deals with the design of an electronic three wheeled-robot capable of tracking a black line by means of infrared sensors and also capable of moving through a given trajectory by control of limit switches at a relatively high speed. The method consists first in developing a program written in Basic language under Microcode plus environment and loading it into the microcontroller to control the robot. Various PWM techniques were adopted in the programming to handle the turning left, right, the moving forward and backward. In addition, necessary hardware involving 6 V DC motor, limit switches, infrared sensors, 6 V battery and others have been assembled on a PIC 16 F 877 microprocessor board and put in a case, shaped as a vehicle. H bridge motor control and PWM were used to control the DC motors. The implementation is finally successful. The robot can move autonomously across a black line and also pass through a complex race in absence of black line by means of limit switches. The motor can complete a race of 2 m in 10 s and turn at angles less than 30 degree while remaining stable...|$|E
30|$|SSSC injects a {{controllable}} {{and almost}} sinusoidal voltage which remains {{in series with}} the transmission network (Hingorani & Gyugi 2000). The injected voltage source imposes virtual reactance in the line which in turn controls the power flow of the transmission line. This control of line power flow is independent {{of the magnitude of}} the line current (Hingorani & Gyugi 2000). The ability of SSSC to operate in both inductive and capacitive mode makes it very efficient in controlling the power flow in the system. In either case the injected voltage remains in quadrature with the line current and therefore acts as capacitive or inductive reactance in series with the transmission line. Besides <b>controlling</b> <b>line</b> power flow, SSSC offers good response time with perfectly smooth transition from (+ve) positive to (−ve) negative power through zero voltage injection. Unlike other series compensating devices, SSSC does not run the risk of getting into classical resonance issues at fundamental frequency operation {{because of the fact that}} for every practical scenarios line inductance (L) is essentially regulated by injected compensating voltage produced (Acha et al. 2004). Aside from controlling the power flow of the line, SSSC can be utilized as a Power Oscillation damping (POD) device through modulation of series reactive power compensation (Zhang et al. 2006). The energy storage ability of SSSC can enhance the effectiveness of POD by absorbing or injecting real power into the transmission line.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{for this}} project {{was to investigate the}} feasibility of making high aspect ratio SU 8 structures via contact lithography with a target of 10 : 1 and line width resolution of about 2 μm. Factors investigated include exposure dose of 150 mJ/cm 2, 200 mJ/cm 2, 250 mJ/cm 2 and PEB times of 1. 5 mm, 3 mm and 4. 5 mm. The responses were line width CD and sidewall angle. The approach was first to optimize the thickness of the resist coated. This was done by generating a spin speed curve for the SU 8 formulation used. Secondly, was to optimize the line width CD. A 32 full factorial experiment was performed. From earlier screening experiments, the center point treatment combination was using a dose of 200 mJ/cm 2, and PEB time of 3 mm. Statistical analysis showed a large residual error in the response data and thus unexplained variation in the process as it pertains to <b>controlling</b> <b>line</b> width CD and sidewall angle. The treatment combination with the smallest 8 μm line width was dose of 200 mJ/cm 2, PEB time of 1. 5 mm and the measured feature width was 7. 1 μm to give an aspect ratio of approximately 3 : 1. Across all treatment combinations, dose of 250 mJ/cm 2, PEB time of 4. 5 mm gave the smallest line width CD resolved with a CD of 5. 1 μm giving approximately 4 : 1 aspect ratio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{question}} of whether selection experiments ought to include a <b>control</b> <b>line,</b> as opposed to investing all facilities in a single selected line, is addressed using a likelihood perspective. The consequences of using a <b>control</b> <b>line</b> are evaluated under two scenarios. In the first one, environmental trend is modeled and inferred from the data. In this case, a <b>control</b> <b>line</b> is shown to be highly beneficial {{in terms of the}} efficiency of inferences about eheritability and response to selection. In the second scenario, environmental trend is not modeled. One can imagine that a previous analysis of the experimental data had lent support to this decision. It is shown that in this situation where a <b>control</b> <b>line</b> may seem superfluous, inclusion of a <b>control</b> <b>line</b> can result in minor gains in efficiency if a high selection intensity is practiced in the selected line. Further, if there is a loss, it is moderately small. The results are verified to hold under more complicated data structures via Monte Carlo simulation. For completeness, divergent selection designs are also reviewed, and inferences based on a conditional and full likelihood approach are contrasted. </p...|$|R
