I said no! I played hooky in all my Arabic classes. Every class that I missed was an act of resistance, a slice of liberty conquered. My rejection was voluntary and purposeful." [...] By 1975, he had abandoned formal education. He left for France in search of work.|$|E

The program featured former Liberal Party member Guy Pearse and Four Corners host Janine Cohen, while others concerned about the influence exerted by the fossil fuel lobby also participated. The report was based on a thesis Pearse wrote at the Australian National University between 1999 and 2005 regarding the response of Australian business to global warming. According to the program, lobby groups representing the coal, <b>car,</b> <b>oil,</b> and aluminium industries have wielded their power to prevent Australia from reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, which were already among the highest per capita in the world in 1990.|$|E

40|$|In this study,five {{contaminated}} soil samples with benzene, used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> and diesel {{were collected from}} five car workshops in Kuala Lumpur area,Malaysia. The microbial strains were isolated using selective media(agar containing crude oil,used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> and benzene). Microorganisms were identified by biochemical test and then used in biodegradation experiment of two types of crude oils(Miri and Masila) and used <b>car</b> <b>oil.</b> Qualitative determination of the degradation capacity of crude oils and used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> was driven in 24 well cell culture cluster-flat bottom,adding to each well nutrient broth medium,crude oil or used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> and the isolated microorganism cultured in the tubes(single and mixtures) and incubated at 27 -°C for 30 days. For hydrocarbons rate of biodegradation measurement,sterilized soil was distributed in petri dishes, 3 % w/w of two crude oils and used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> were added,separately and then supplemented with isolated strains(single and mixtures). One Petri dish {{was used as a}} control without any microbial addition. Absorbance was determined by spectrophotometer at 360 nm and at 340 nm for crude oils and used <b>car</b> <b>oil,</b> respectively. The effect of aeration,added NPK and added microbial degraders on biodegradation of Masila crude oil and used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> was studied. Soil was supplemented with 20 % Masila crude oil and used car oil,separately. The soil was distributed into containers. Container(1) was aerated twice a week,NPK 1 : 1 : 1 was added to container(2),mixture of all isolated strains with degrading capacity was added to container(3. Finally, NPK with continued aeration in addition to the microbial mixture were applied to the last container (4). One container was used as a control without any addition (soil and contaminant only). Colony Forming Unit (CFU) of total heterotrophic microbes and hydrocarbon utilizing microbes,PH and percentage of oils degradation were determined. 22 microbial strains were isolated and identified as,Achrombacter,Aeromonas,Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas,Corynebacterium,Penicillium,Enterobacteriaceae (Enteric rods),Actinobacillus,Streptomyces,budding yeast cells, Cladosporum and Geotrichum spp. The highest biodegradation result in Miri crude oil after 30 days were 54. 33 % and 84. 61 % for strain Z 13 (Corynebacterium spp.) and microbial mixture of the strains isolated from Rawang and Serdang area (MS),respectively. While in Masila crude oil was 33. 81 % for Strain A 3 (Klebsiella pneumonia) and 49. 47 % for microbial mixture of the strains isolated from Serdang (Smix). In used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> biodegradation experiment,strain Z 4 (Corynebacterium) had the highest degradation with 72. 9 %. While microbial mixture of the strains isolated from Kajang (Zmix) had 72. 4 % of degradation. In the experiment of the effect of aeration,added NPK and added microbial degraders on biodegradation,the aerated container showed 56. 62 % of degradation after 42 days in Masila crude oil,while the container which contained NPK and was aerated and supplemented with isolated strains showed 66 % degradation in used <b>car</b> <b>oil.</b> Generally,two bacterial species and one fungal species isolated were found to be effective degraders (Corynebacterium spp,Streptomyces spp. and Cladosporum spp,), respectively. The highest degradability by single strains was on used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> which might be due to the adaptability of the isolated microbes to use it. The microbial mixtures showed higher effect on the biodegradation than the single strains. Aeration found {{to be the most important}} in the effect on the biodegradation results...|$|E

40|$|Several {{technology}} and fuel options {{could be used}} to lower the strong oil dependence of the transportation sector. To formulate policies and to cost-effectively meet oil reduction objectives, assessments and comparisons of the long-term economic performances of different technology trajectories are essential. In this work, the energy and technology costs associated with reducing oil consumption in passenger cars in Sweden are calculated for a number of possible future transport fuel pathways and for different energy prices and climate policies. An optimisation model is applied in a simulatory multiple-run approach for this purpose. The model encompasses the transportation sector, as well as the stationary energy system. In terms of results, a methanol-based pathway gives incremental system costs in the range of − 0. 9 – 3 billion EUR for a complete phase-out of passenger <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> up to 2030. As compared to the methanol pathway, other biomass gasification-based fuel pathways involve additional incremental system costs in the region of 3 billion EUR, whereas ethanol- and electricity-based pathways give additional incremental system costs of 4 – 5 billion EUR. At lower oil reduction levels, the cost differences between the pathways are smaller and the electricity-based pathway is significantly more cost-competitive...|$|E
