500|$|Marshall's wit is {{best remembered}} for a phrase he {{introduced}} to the American lexicon. While presiding over a Senate session in 1914, Marshall responded to earlier comments from Senator Joseph L. Bristow in which the senator provided {{a long list of}} what he felt the country needed. Marshall reportedly leaned over and muttered to one of his clerks, [...] "What this <b>country</b> <b>needs</b> is more of this; what this <b>country</b> <b>needs</b> is more of that" [...] and quipped loudly enough others to overhear, [...] "What this <b>country</b> <b>needs</b> is a really good five-cent cigar." [...] Marshall’s remark was popularized and widely circulated among a network of newspapers. Other accounts later embellished the story, including the exact situation that prompted his comment. In 1922 Marshall explained that the five-cent cigar was a metaphor for simpler times [...] and [...] "buckling down to thrift and work." ...|$|E
