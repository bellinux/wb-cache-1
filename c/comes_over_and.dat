On the day of their wedding, Amanda <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> gives Greenlee gifts from Kendall, such as the first fusion {{lipstick}} ever made, and more, Madison North decides to go to work. Madison finds Greenlee's bouquet, and Greenlee catches her with it. Madison rushes off, leaving her phone behind. When Emma, Spike, and Ryan arrive, Madison finds out her phone is gone. She calls it using Scott's phone and Emma picks up. Madison reluctantly comes to get the phone and starts to have cramps while she's there. Ryan tries to help her and asks her what's wrong. She {{says that it is}} too soon; when Ryan asks questions what is too soon, Greenlee sees her and blurts out that Madison's pregnant. The information shocks Ryan.|$|E
500|$|Shawn Roberts was {{originally}} going {{to audition for}} Chris Redfield before Miller accepted the role. He went to audition {{for the role of}} Albert Wesker, a role previously played by Jason O'Mara. Describing the character Roberts said, [...] " [...] Chairman of the Umbrella Corporation. He is in a position of power. He pretty much runs the world, and Alice is an annoyance. It's a whole process: I get to set and wardrobe gives me this big, long black jacket, and props <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> gives me the dark glasses and the gloves. By the time you are all dressed you stand a little straighter, you walk a little differently. He's got everything going for him—he's super fast, super strong, has the ability to regenerate—it's all the elements from the game. That was one thing we all agreed on from the start: this character has to be for the fans." [...] Sienna Guillory reprises her role as Jill Valentine, who was last seen in Resident Evil: Apocalypse. She is featured briefly in a scene shown during the credits, setting up the [...]|$|E
2500|$|Adele and Frank fall in {{love and}} plan to escape to Canada with Henry, packing the car and {{cleaning}} out the house. Meanwhile, Henry develops a friendship with a mature girl named Eleanor, and goes to see her one more time before they leave. She manipulates him into thinking Adele and Frank are going to abandon him and he accidentally reveals Frank's past. Adele assures Henry she would never leave him. [...] The morning they are going to leave, Henry takes a note to his father's house and leaves it in his mailbox. While he is walking home, a policeman offers to drive him home, and Henry accepts. The policeman is suspicious of the packed car and nearly-empty house, but eventually leaves. Adele goes to the bank to get all the money out of her account, and the bank staff, too, are suspicious. [...] While Adele is gone, the neighbor <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> speaks to Frank. She, too, is suspicious of who he may be. Henry's father finds the note that Henry left, and calls the house. Before Adele, Frank, and Henry can escape, they hear police sirens approaching. [...] Frank ties Henry and Adele up before he goes out to surrender, so that they won't be charged with harboring a fugitive. [...] It is not revealed who called the police to report Frank's presence at the house. Adele wants to plead in Frank's case but is warned by the prosecutor himself that if she does, Henry might be taken away from her. She writes letters to Frank but to protect her he returns them all unopened.|$|E

Young men, when they get out to those places, are not quite so particular as they ought to be, I daresay. When I was young, perhaps I was not as steady as I ought to have been. But, by George! here is a man <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> asks for a lot of money; and then the woman asks for money; and then they say that if they don't get it, they'll swear the fellow was married in Australia. I can't fancy that any jury will believe that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|March 5.--I have {{a letter}} from our member, Whytbank, adjuring me to assist the gentlemen of the county with an address against the Reform Bill, which menaces them with being blended with Peeblesshire, and losing of {{consequence}} one half of their franchise. Mr. Pringle conjures me not to be very nice in choosing my epithets. Mr. Pringle, Torwoodlee, <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> speaks to the same purpose, adding, {{it will be the}} greatest service I can do the county, etc. This, in a manner, drives me out of a resolution to keep myself clear of politics, and [...] "let them fight dog, fight bear." [...] But I am too easy to be persuaded to bear a hand. The young Duke of Buccleuch comes to visit me also; so I promised to shake my duds and give them a cast of my calling, fall back, fall edge.|$|E

He always amuses me when he <b>comes</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> I think he amuses himself as well. There's a considerable number like him, round in society; they're very fashionable just now. I don't know what they're trying to do--whether they're {{trying to get up}} a revolution. I hope at any rate they'll put it off till after I'm gone. You see they want to disestablish everything; but I'm a pretty big landowner here, and I don't want to be disestablished. I wouldn't have come over if I had {{thought they were going to}} behave like that," [...] Mr. Touchett went on with expanding hilarity. [...] "I came over because I thought England was a safe country. I call it a regular fraud if they are going to introduce any considerable changes; there'll be a large number disappointed in that case." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not; {{but if you}} observe, {{people always}} live for ever {{when there is an}} annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty. An annuity is a very serious business; it <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over every year, and there is no getting rid of it. You are not aware of what you are doing. I have known {{a great deal of the}} trouble of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated {{servants}} by my father's will, and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it. Twice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing. My mother was quite sick of it. Her income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever. It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Already I know much. I {{know that}} the will is not destroyed, and yet I know not where it is, but I may know yet. I have dreams at night. I see at times before me a small chamber, with a single arm-chair and a table there; a light stands upon the table, and a figure, your brother, sits there writing. The will lies {{on the table before}} him. He has risen now, and has taken up the will and the candle, but the light burns dimly, and I cannot see what he does with it; but I know somehow that he has put it into a place of safety, and that it is there still. A voice seems to say to me, 'Patience, and wait: I guard it!' When I wake I know this is no {{ordinary}} dream, for it <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over again, and I {{know that the}} chamber is in existence. I can see it now before me, with its low ceiling, and a stone staircase which seems to run through it, leading both up and down--I know not where. I can see it, with its table and chair, with books and some scattered papers, and a figure is sitting in the chair, and which yet {{seems to me to be}} no figure, but a mere shadow; but I know that he is there, and that he will wait until the time comes for the hidden will to be found. Miss Harmer!" [...] Polly said, turning suddenly round upon her, [...] "you best know how far my dream is true, and whether such a chamber as I have seen exists!" ...|$|E

6000|$|May 16 to 22.--I visit Central Park {{now almost}} every day, sitting, or slowly rambling, or riding around. The whole place {{presents}} its very best appearance this current month--the full flush of the trees, the plentiful white and pink of the flowering shrubs, the emerald {{green of the}} grass spreading everywhere, yellow dotted still with dandelions --the specialty of the plentiful gray rocks, peculiar to these grounds, cropping out, miles and miles--and over all the beauty and purity, three days out of four, of our summer skies. As I sit, placidly, early afternoon, off against Ninetieth street, the policeman, C. C., a well-form'd sandy-complexion'd young fellow, <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> stands near me. We grow quite friendly and chatty forth-with. He is a New Yorker born and raised, and in answer to my questions tells me {{about the life of}} a New York Park policeman, (while he talks keeping his eyes and ears vigilantly open, occasionally pausing and moving where he can get full views of the vistas of the road, up and down, and the spaces around.) The pay is $2.40 a day (seven days to a week)--the men come on and work eight hours straight ahead, which is all that is required of them out of the twenty-four. The position has more risks than one might suppose--for instance if a team or horse runs away (which happens daily) each man is expected not only to be prompt, but to waive safety and stop wildest nag or nags--(do it, and don't be thinking of your bones or face)--give the alarm-whistle too, so that other guards may repeat, and the vehicles up and down the tracks be warn'd. Injuries to the men are continually happening. There is much alertness and quiet strength. (Few appreciate, I have often thought, the Ulyssean capacity, derring do, quick readiness in emergencies, practicality, unwitting devotion and heroism, among our American young men and working-people--the firemen, the railroad employes, the steamer and ferry men, the police, the conductors and drivers--the whole splendid average of native stock, city and country.) It is good work, though; and upon the whole, the Park force members like it. They see life, and the excitement keeps them up. There is not so much difficulty as might be supposed from tramps, roughs, or in keeping people [...] "off the grass." [...] The worst trouble of the regular Park employe is from malarial fever, chills, and the like.|$|E
