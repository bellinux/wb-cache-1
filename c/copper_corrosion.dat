25|$|Often it is {{possible}} to chemically remove the products of corrosion. For example, phosphoric acid in the form of naval jelly is often applied to ferrous tools or surfaces to remove rust. Corrosion removal {{should not be confused with}} electropolishing, which removes some layers of the underlying metal to make a smooth surface. For example, phosphoric acid may also be used to electropolish copper but it does this by removing copper, not the products of <b>copper</b> <b>corrosion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Architectural copper is, however, {{susceptible}} to corrosive attack under certain conditions. Oxidizing acids, oxidizing heavy-metal salts, alkalis, sulfur and nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and some sulfur and ammonium compounds can expedite <b>copper</b> <b>corrosion.</b> Precipitation {{in areas with}} a pH less than 5.5 may corrode copper, possibly before a patina or protective oxide film has the time to form. Acidic precipitation, known as acid rain, is due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion, chemical manufacturing, or other processes that release sulfur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. Erosion corrosion may occur when acidic water from a non-copper roof that does not neutralise the acidity, such as tile, slate, wood, or asphalt, falls on a small area of copper. Line corrosion can occur if the drip edge of an inert roofing material rests directly on copper. A solution to this may be to raise the lower edge of the shingles with a cant strip, or to provide a replaceable reinforcing strip between the shingles and the copper. Proper water-shedding design and detailing, which reduces the dwell time of acidic water on metal surfaces, can prevent the majority of atmospheric corrosion problems.|$|E

40|$|In this work, <b>copper</b> {{bimetallic}} <b>corrosion</b> and inhibition in ultra {{large scale}} interconnect fabrication process is explored. Corrosion behavior of physical vapor deposited (PVD) copper on ruthenium on acidic and alkaline solutions was investigated {{with and without}} organic inhibitors. Bimetallic corrosion screening experiments were carried out to determine the corrosion rate. Potentiodynamic polarization experiments yielded information on the galvanic couples and also corrosion rates. XPS and FTIR surface analysis gave important information pertaining inhibition mechanism of organic inhibitors. Interestingly copper in contact with ruthenium in cleaning solution led to increased corrosion rate compared to copper in contact with tantalum. On the other hand when cobalt was in contact with copper, cobalt corroded and copper did not. We ascribe this phenomenon to {{the difference in the}} standard reduction potentials of the two metals in contact and in such a case a less noble metal will be corroded. The effects of plasma etch gases such as CF 4, CF 4 +O 2, C 4 F 8, CH 2 F 2 and SF 6 on <b>copper</b> bimetallic <b>corrosion</b> was investigated too in alkaline solution.

40|$|Interactions between {{copper and}} {{chlorine}} disinfectants were examined {{from the perspective}} of disinfectant decay and <b>copper</b> pitting <b>corrosion.</b> Sparingly soluble cupric hydroxide catalyzed the rapid decay of free chlorine, which in turn, led to production of less soluble and more crystalline phases of cupric hydroxide. The catalytic activity of the cupric hydroxide was retained over multiple cycles of chlorine dosing. Experiments with chloramine revealed that copper species could also trigger rapid loss of chloramine disinfectant. In copper pipes, loss of free chlorine and chloramine were both rapid during stagnation. Reactivity of the copper to the disinfectants was retained for weeks.

However, copper sulphide deposition on oil-paper insulation can lead to insulation failures in power transformers. This paper presents the influences of <b>copper</b> sulfur <b>corrosion</b> and <b>copper</b> sulphide deposition on copper wires and oil-paper insulation in power transformers. Thermal aging tests of paper-wrapped copper wires and bare copper wires in insulating oil were carried out at 130 °C and 150 °C in laboratory.

3000|$|According to Scott [2], who has {{reviewed}} the older literature, <b>copper</b> phosphates as <b>corrosion</b> products are not common. However, the reported <b>copper</b> phosphate <b>corrosion</b> products are libethenite (Cu 2 (OH)PO 4), cornetite (Cu 3 (PO 4)(OH) 3), sampleite (NaCaCu 5 (PO 4) 4 Cl· 5 H 2 O), hydrated copper phosphate (cupric orthophosphate Cu 3 (PO 4) 2 · 3 H 2 O) and zapatalite (Cu 3 Al 4 (PO 4) 3 (OH) 9 · 3 H 2 O). Among these compounds {{the most frequent}} copper phosphate found as a corrosion product is libethenite (Cu 2 (OH)PO 4) often associated with cremation sites. Recent work has reported both sampleite and libethenite on a Lydian bed of iron, bronze and copper dating to about 505 BC [35], and libethenite was found by Berger on a Nordic bronze dagger from Schoolbek farm, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, dating from the mid- 2 nd millennium BC [36]. Three bronze arrowheads unearthed at Dachengdun site in Anhui province, China all showed libethenite (Cu 2 (OH)PO 4) in the corrosion products [37] while corrosion {{on a pair of}} bronze tweezers wrapped with silk products and buried near a person’s waist in Gansu province, China was found to contain cupric orthophosphate (Cu 3 (PO 4) 2 · 3 H 2 O) [38]. It appears that more frequent analysis of corrosion products on ancient bronzes is revealing more copper phosphates and the present study is in accordance with these findings. According to Mattson [39] and Fabrizi [40], bronzes with <b>copper</b> phosphate <b>corrosion</b> products are rare and less commonly found with copper chloride products which form in an acid environment. The analysis results of the three swords in this paper is in line with their conclusion. The two pH values obtained from Lijiaba site are close to neutral and slightly alkaline while soil from Birka where <b>copper</b> phosphate <b>corrosion</b> products also occur [39] shows a pH of about 8. This is consistent with a pH control on the formation of phosphate corrosion products. Libethenite has been produced experimentally through the reaction 2 Cu^ 2 + [...] + HPO_ 4 ^ 2 - [...] + 2 OH^ - →Cu_ 2 PO_ 4 OH + H_ 2 O at pH 7 [41]. Hence the presence of libethenite on the swords from Lijiaba may reflect the pH of the burial environment.|$|R

40|$|Enrichment {{of copper}} beneath {{amorphous}} anodic films on relatively dilute, solid-solution Al-Cu alloys is necessary before copper can be oxidized and {{incorporated into the}} oxide layer. A similar enrichment arises during electropolishing, which also develops an amorphous oxide. In these cases, external polarization is applied, usually generating a relatively high oxidation rate. In contrast, enrichment behaviour at the corrosion potential has received less attention. The present study examines the corrosion of Al-Cu alloys, containing up to 6. 7 at. % Cu, in 0. 1 M sodium hydroxide solution at 293 K. Copper is again found to enrich in the alloy, similarly to behaviour with anodic polarization. However, following enrichment, discrete copper-rich particles appear to be generated in the corrosion product. These are suggested to be nanoparticles of <b>copper,</b> since the <b>corrosion</b> potentials of the alloys are low relative to that required for oxidation of <b>copper.</b> The <b>corrosion</b> rate increases with increase of both time and copper content of the alloy, probably associated with a greater cathodic activity due to {{an increasing number of}} nanoparticles.
