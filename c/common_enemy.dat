5|$|Several {{attempts}} at a Franco-Mongol alliance against the Islamic caliphates, their <b>common</b> <b>enemy,</b> {{were made by}} various leaders among the Frankish Crusaders and the Mongol Empire in the 13th century. Such an alliance might have seemed an obvious choice: the Mongols were already sympathetic to Christianity, given the presence of many influential Nestorian Christians in the Mongol court. The Franks (Western Europeans {{and those in the}} Crusader States of the Levant) were open to the idea of support from the East, in part owing to the long-running legend of the mythical Prester John, an Eastern king in a magical kingdom who many believed would one day come to the assistance of the Crusaders in the Holy Land. The Franks and Mongols also shared a <b>common</b> <b>enemy</b> in the Muslims. However, despite many messages, gifts, and emissaries {{over the course of several}} decades, the often-proposed alliance never came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|In the city, Argante and Armida, {{in danger}} from a <b>common</b> <b>enemy,</b> become {{reconciled}} and prepare their troops for battle. Goffredo's army advances, and battle finally commences. After {{a struggle for}} supremacy, Jerusalem falls to Goffredo; Argante is overcome and captured by Rinaldo, while Armida is taken by Eustazio. Rinaldo and Almirena celebrate their love and forthcoming marriage. Armida, accepting her defeat, breaks the wand which {{is the source of}} her evil power and together with Argante embraces Christianity. Goffredo expresses his forgiveness to his beaten foes and sets them free, before victors and vanquished join in a chorus of reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Dmowski {{became more}} {{receptive}} to Russian overtures, particularly neoslavism, warming up {{to the idea that}} Poland and Russia may have a common future, particularly due to Germany being their <b>common</b> <b>enemy.</b> In light of what he regarded as Russian cultural inferiority, Dmowski felt that a strong Russia was more acceptable than a strong Germany. In Dmowski's view, the Russian policy of Russification would not succeed in subjugating the Poles, while the Germans would be far more successful with their Germanisation policies. He explained those views in his book Niemcy, Rosja i kwestia Polska (Germany, Russia and the Polish Cause), published in 1908.|$|E

5|$|Baruch Kimmerling and Joel S. Migdal {{argue that}} the revolt was a {{formative}} event for the Palestinian sense of nationhood in that it brought together disparate groups against a <b>common</b> <b>enemy.</b> Moreover, they asserted that these groups reemerged later to constitute the Palestinian people. The revolt represented a moment of political unity in Palestine. However, the ultimate intention of the notables and rebel leaders was to force out the Egyptian army and reinstate Ottoman rule {{as a means of}} restoring the Ottoman-era standards that defined the relationship {{between the government and the}} governed. These standards were made up of the religious laws, administrative codes and local norms and traditions that were disrupted by Egyptian reforms.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond met Philip, Count of Flanders, who {{had come}} to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in September 1177. According to the {{contemporaneous}} William of Tyre, many crusaders blamed Bohemond and RaymondIII of Tripoli for dissuading Philip from participating in a military campaign against Egypt, preferring instead to take advantage of Philip's presence in their own realms. Indeed, in December Philip and Bohemond jointly laid siege to Harenc, a fortress of As-Salih Ismail al-Malik, Emir of Damascus, seizing the opportunity following a mutiny of the garrison. They lifted the siege soon after As-Salih informed them that Saladin (the <b>common</b> <b>enemy</b> of both As-Salih and Bohemond) had left Egypt for Syria. As-Salih paid 50,000 dinars and renounced half of the nearby villages in favor of Bohemond.|$|E
5|$|The Jin–Song Wars were {{a series}} of {{conflicts}} between the Jurchen Jin dynasty (1115–1234) and Han Chinese Song dynasty (960–1279). In 1115, the Jurchens rebelled against their overlords, the Khitan Liao dynasty (907–1125), and declared {{the formation of the}} Jin. Allying with the Song against their <b>common</b> <b>enemy</b> the Liao, the Jin promised to return to the Song the territories in northern China that had fallen under Liao control since 938. The Jurchens' quick defeat of the Liao combined with Song military failures made the Jin reluctant to cede these territories. After {{a series of}} failed negotiations that embittered both sides, the Jurchens attacked the Song in November 1125, dispatching one army towards Taiyuan and the other towards Kaifeng, the Song capital.|$|E

5|$|After Extreme Rules, Orton began pairing with Daniel Bryan {{despite their}} poor {{relationship}} {{to face a}} <b>common</b> <b>enemy</b> in the Shield. On the June 14 SmackDown, Orton teamed with Bryan and Kane to end the Shield's unpinned and unsubmitted streak in televised six-man tag matches. Three days later at Payback, Orton and Bryan's poor teamwork resulted in an unsuccessful challenge for Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins' WWE Tag Team Championships. The following night on Raw, Orton and Bryan faced off in a no disqualification match, which Orton won via referee stoppage after Bryan suffered a legitimate nerve injury. Four days later on SmackDown, Orton was defeated by Bryan in a singles match via countout. Orton and Bryan faced {{each other for the}} third time on the next Raw, but their match ended in a no-contest after both men were counted out. Later that night, Orton was defeated by Bryan in a Street Fight Match after he was forced to submit to the Yes! Lock with a kindo stick applied to the move.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} Latin {{authors of the}} twelfth century, William is {{surprisingly}} favourable to the Byzantine Empire. He had visited the Byzantine court as an official ambassador and probably knew more about Byzantine affairs than any other Latin chronicler. He shared the poor opinion of Alexius I Comnenus that had developed during the First Crusade, although he was also critical {{of some of the}} crusaders' dealings with Alexius. He was more impressed by Alexius' son John II Comnenus; he did not approve of John's attempts to bring the crusader Principality of Antioch under Byzantine control, but John's military expeditions against the Muslim states, the <b>common</b> <b>enemy</b> of both Greeks and Latins, were considered admirable. Emperor Manuel, whom William met during his visits to Constantinople, was portrayed more ambivalently, much like King Amalric. William admired him personally, but recognized that the Empire was powerless to help Jerusalem against the Muslim forces of Nur ad-Din and Saladin. William was especially disappointed in the failure of the joint campaign against Egypt in 1169. The end of the Historia coincides with the massacre of the Latins in Constantinople and the chaos that followed the coup of Andronicus I Comnenus, and in his description of those events, William was certainly not immune to the extreme anti-Greek rhetoric that was often found in Western European sources.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 732, Marwan led 40,000 men north into Khazar lands. The {{accounts}} of this campaign are confused: Ibn A'tham records that he reached Balanjar and returned to Derbent with much captured livestock, but the campaign is described in terms strongly reminiscent of Maslama's expeditions in 728 and 731, and its veracity is open to doubt. Ibn Khayyat {{on the other hand}} reports that Marwan led a far more limited campaign on the country immediately to the north of Derbent and then retired there to spend the winter. Marwan was more active in the south, where he raised Ashot III Bagratuni to the position of presiding prince of Armenia, effectively granting the country broad autonomy in exchange for the service of its soldiers alongside the Caliphate's armies. This unique concession points, according to Blankinship, to the worsening manpower crisis faced by the Caliphate. At about the same time, the Khazars and Byzantines strengthened their ties and formalized their alliance against their <b>common</b> <b>enemy</b> with the marriage of Constantine V to the Khazar princess Tzitzak.|$|E

5|$|On Earth, Nite Owl and Rorschach {{continue}} {{to uncover the}} conspiracy surrounding the death of The Comedian and the accusations that drove Manhattan into exile. They discover evidence that Veidt may be behind the plan. Rorschach writes his suspicions about Veidt in his journal, {{in which he has}} been recording his entire investigation, and mails it to New Frontiersman, a local right-wing newspaper. The pair then leave New York and confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat. Veidt explains his underlying plan is to save humanity from impending nuclear war between the United States and Soviet Union by faking an alien invasion in New York City, which will annihilate half the city's population. He hopes this will unite the nations against a perceived <b>common</b> <b>enemy.</b> He also reveals that he had murdered The Comedian, arranged for Dr. Manhattan's past associates to contract cancer, staged the attempt on his own life in order to place himself above suspicion, and killed Moloch in order to frame Rorschach. This was all done in an attempt to prevent his plan from being exposed. Nite Owl and Rorschach find Veidt's logic callous and abhorrent, but Veidt has already enacted his plan.|$|E
5|$|The Lithuanian Civil War of 1389–92 was {{the second}} civil {{conflict}} between Jogaila, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his cousin Vytautas. At issue was control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, then the largest state in Europe. Jogaila had been crowned King of Poland in 1386; he installed his brother Skirgaila as ruler of Lithuania. Skirgaila proved unpopular and Vytautas attempted to depose him. When his first attempt to take {{the capital city of}} Vilnius failed, Vytautas forged an alliance with the Teutonic Knights, their <b>common</b> <b>enemy</b> – just as both cousins had done during the Lithuanian Civil War between 1381 and 1384. Vytautas and the Knights unsuccessfully besieged Vilnius in 1390. Over the next two years it became clear that neither side could achieve a quick victory, and Jogaila proposed a compromise: Vytautas would become Grand Duke and Jogaila would remain Superior Duke. This proposal was formalized in the Ostrów Agreement of 1392, and Vytautas turned against the Knights. He went on to reign as Grand Duke of Lithuania for 38 years, and the cousins remained at peace.|$|E
