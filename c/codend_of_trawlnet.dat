40|$|The bag <b>of</b> a <b>trawlnet</b> is {{considered}} as an elliptical cone, its wings as merely forward extensions of this cone. The {{dimensions of the}} cone are derived from the measured wingend spread and the headline height (gape) of the net and from its specification drawings.

40|$|Codends are {{the rear}} parts of trawls, which collect the catch and {{where most of}} the {{selectivity}} process occurs. Selectivity is the process by which the large sh are retained while the small ones are released. The codends applied in many sheries often consist of only one type of mesh. Therefore it is reason- able to consider these codends as being axisymmetric. Their shapes depend mainly on the volume of catch, on the shape of meshes (diamond, square, hexagonal) and on the number of meshes along and around the <b>codend.</b> The shape <b>of</b> the <b>codends</b> is <b>of</b> prime importance {{in order to understand the}} se- lectivity process.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 An {{analysis}} was conducted to estimate the minimum mesh size for managing the common Chilean hake (Merluccius gayi) fishery. Secondary objectives were to establish the selective relationship between mesh size and fish length, to examine growth patterns and related parameters, and to estimate the critical age (or optimum size) at which hake cohorts reach their maximum biomass. Selectivity was estimated from experiments performed on the central coast of Chile using trawls with <b>codends</b> <b>of</b> 60 -, 80 -, 100 -, and 120 -mm mesh size. No differences in gear selectivity were found between sexes, thus a common linear relationship was established. The relative growth of hake proved to be allometric for both females and males with little departure from isometry, and was statistically different between sexes. The Brody growth coefficient, k, was estimated for each sex yielding values of 0. 1382 for females and 0. 3230 for males. Differences in asymptotic weight (Winf = 3, 167. 77 gr in females, and Winf = 776. 23 gr in males) together with minor differences in natural mortality and in the adjusted "age zero", importantly influenced estimates of critical age. The results of critical age determinations were 5. 7 years (49. 74 cm) for females, and 3. 8 years (38. 15 cm) for males. To expedite enforcement, and to produce a minimum departure from their respective age optima, a convenient mesh of 110 mm was recommended. This mesh will theoretically retain the hake at 42. 22 cm which corresponds to an age of 4. 21 years for females, and 4. 96 years for males. Additional studies should be carried out to confirm the selective pattern of gears on hake with tunnels and <b>codends</b> <b>of</b> 110 mm mesh size, and to evaluate the variations in catch caused by differences in trawling speeds, trawling time, type of grounds, migratory movements of hake, and other fishing variables...|$|R

Beam {{trawling}} on brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important fisheries for the German fleet. It is an open fishery without a defined quota. Indicators such as increased by-catch, a predominance of undersized shrimp in catches, and a high fishing mortality all suggest that improved gear selectivity could have positive economic impacts. In the CRANNET project we tested a range <b>of</b> <b>codend</b> mesh sizes and shapes to derive selection curves, which were subsequently implemented within a population model. The results were combined with typical revenues to determine the most profitable mesh. A considerable decrease in by-catch was observed with all tested <b>codends</b> <b>of</b> larger mesh size, while the marketable catch component was reduced only slightly. The effect of shrimp escapement on the population and thus on future catch was estimated with a population model. This cohort based yield-per-recruit model simulates the population based upon seasonal and size-specific growth and mortality rates. In combination with selectivity curves and market prices we estimated the effect of alternate mesh on catches and revenues both immediately following introduction and at a later, balanced state. The mesh size that is commonly used at present was predicted to yield the lowest catches and revenues, while any increase in mesh size resulted in a considerable increase in catch and revenue. However, this result would only apply if larger mesh sizes were employed throughout the entire brown shrimp fleet. Aside from replacing codends, which have a short lifespan anyway, the measure is considered to be cost-neutral...|$|R

[...] University of Washington, 1996 The {{present study}} is entirely focus on the {{analysis}} selectivity from alternate-haul experiments performed on fishing grounds off the coasts of Washington, Oregon and northern California, and in the Bering Sea, under commercial fishing conditions. Participating fishing vessels towed especially designed codends that differed in mesh size and shape, and layers of netting, in predetermined sequence. All other decisions concerning the fishing and hauling operations were left to the skippers of the participant vessels. After a brief introduction describing the main concepts, experimental designs and estimation procedures related to fish size selection and its controlling factors, pooled selectivity data for ten commercially important flat and rockfish species were analyzed for the first time. The logistic, probit, Gompertz, negative extreme value and Richards curves were fitted to data to obtain the best selection curves for four diamond- and two square-mesh codends with different mesh sizes. The negative exponential curve produced best fits in 28 out of, mostly with rockfish data. Length of 50 % retention was found to increase with increasing mesh sizes. Square-mesh codends appeared to be less selective than diamond-mesh <b>codends</b> <b>of</b> similar mesh size. Next, a new maximum likelihood estimation procedure based on a multinomial distribution was developed {{for the analysis of}} alternate-haul data. The method proved to be better than traditional selection-curve fitting procedures, and a good alternative to the binomial based SELECT method. Alternative non-parametric approaches for the analysis of selection curves are also discussed. Two different approaches, one based on a multinomial likelihood and the other on isotonic regression were used in fitting selection curves for two sets of "uncooperative" data. The parametric maximum likelihood estimation procedure was also used to explore the possibility of a simultaneous estimation of selection curves for experimental and control codends. Finally, the issues of between-haul variability and uncertainty in alternate-haul assumptions were dealt with in a multiple hauls selectivity analysis of walleyed pollock data for four experimental codends (two diamond- and two square-mesh). A model to assess the effects <b>of</b> <b>codend</b> type, catch size and towing speed that incorporates the uncertainty in alternate-haul assumptions was developed...|$|R

The Commonwealth Trawl Sector (CTS) and the Tasmanian Danish-seine fishery (TDSF) use a minimum <b>codend</b> mesh sizes <b>of</b> 90 and 70 mm, respectively. The codend mesh size should be tailored to the LML, {{which is based on}} the length of first maturity of females (M 50). This study found the length–girth relationship of N. richardsoni and P. bassensis was not significantly different. Using the covered codend method, these two species had 50 % retention lengths (L 50) of 294 ± 2 and 307 ± 3 mm, in 70 -mm and 90 -mm codends, respectively. L 50 estimates for mesh sizes from this study and others produced a curvilinear relationship: y = 120 ln(x) − 214, with an r 2 of 0. 8504. The size at maturity (M 50) for female N. richardsoni was 337 mm, which is larger than the estimate for female P. bassensis (247 mm). There is a mismatch between the estimates of L 50, the estimates of M 50 and the LMLs in each fishery, leading to suboptimal exploitation of female Platycephalus. The model produced in this paper recommends a <b>codend</b> mesh size <b>of</b> 98 mm for both fisheries to exploit Platycephalus species sustainably...|$|R
40|$|Responsible sheries {{management}} involve, {{among other}} things, operations to avoid catches of juvenile sh. Technical measures of shing gears to exclude small sh are thus generally regulated. Knowledge {{and control over}} the size selection characteristics of the shing gear are therefore required, and the escaping sh should survive for the size selection to be a meaningful action. This thesis consists of four papers that deal with size selectivity and escape mortality of cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aegle nus) and saithe (Pollachius virens) in the Barents Sea bottom trawl sheries. Our {{studies show that the}} trawl ground gears contribute to the overall size selectivity of bottom trawls. Netting bags were rigged underneath a commercial trawl with a rockhopper gear, along the shing line, to collect sh that passed beneath the trawl. Approximately one third of the cod, a quarter of the haddock and seven percent of saithe available to the trawl escaped below the shing line. Cod escape rates were highly length dependent with an estimated length at 50 % retention (L 50) of 38. 5 cm and selection range (L 75 − L 25 = SR) of 34. 1 cm. Length dependence was less pronounced for haddock, and the escape rate of saithe was not length dependent. Some of the sh had been overrun by the gear as evidenced by scale abrasions and video observations. The size selection of a bottom trawl for cod with the mandatory con guration of a sorting grid with 55 mm bar spacings and a 135 mm diamond mesh codend was compared to that <b>of</b> conventional <b>codends</b> <b>of</b> 135 and 155 mm mesh sizes. Previous indirect comparisons have indicated sharper selection (narrower SR) for sorting grids than conventional codends. Based on these comparisons, the use of grids was made mandatory in the Barents Sea bottom trawl shery for cod. Our experimental studies demonstrated no evidence that the grid and mesh combination has sharper selection than conventional <b>codends.</b> The introduction <b>of</b> the grid corresponded to approx. 20 mm increase in mesh size, from 135 mm to 155 mm. The L 50 for the grid declined with increasing catch rates, but grid selection appeared less affected by seasonal variations in girth and sh condition than mesh selectivity. Mortality of cod, saithe and haddock that escaped through meshes and sorting grids were studied in four eld experiments. Cod and saithe mortality were negligible, suggesting that selection devices serve their purpose as conservation tools regarding these species. Haddock mortality was higher and inversely related to sh length. Their mortality could neither been shown to depend upon selection device nor shing intensity. There was, however, a considerable variation between replicates masking any such possible effects. It is concluded that the trawl passage, but not mesh and grid penetration is the ii primary cause of mortality. Injury analysis supports this suggestion. The mortality estimates were confounded by methodological problems. Potential sources of experimentally induced mortality were identi ed throughout the experiments and the methods subsequently improved. The confounding methodological effects are accounted for in a model describing haddock escape mortality...|$|R

A radial escape section (RES) in the aft belly of the trawl allowed fish to activly escape as shrimp was guided by funnels of netting towards the <b>codend.</b> The performance <b>of</b> the new selective device (RES) as well as behaviour of fish in trawls has been observed by a remote controlled television vehicle (RCTV).

40|$|This paper quantifies {{the effects}} of a square mesh codend bycatch {{reduction}} device (BRD) and turtle excluder device (TED) in the deepwater eastern king prawn (Melicertus plebejus) fishery on the southeast Queensland coast, based upon on a 10 -day research charter. The bycatch comprised 224 taxa, mainly gurnards, flatheads, sandpaper fish, hermit and charybdid crabs, mantis shrimps, sand dollars (i. e. sea urchins), dragonets, snipefish, carids and lizardfish. The total mean bycatch rate was comparatively low (1114. 0 g ha− 1 from the standard diamond mesh <b>codend),</b> mainly because <b>of</b> the relatively deep waters associated with the fishery. When the TED and square mesh codend BRD were used together the total mean bycatch rate was significantly reduced by 29...|$|R
40|$|The {{mandatory}} use of bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) in prawn {{trawl fisheries}} is now commonplace in Australia. BRDs {{are designed to}} allow unwanted or juvenile species to escape fishing nets with consequent benefits for the abundance of such species, species which prey on them, and general ecosystem integrity. In the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery, {{as well as in}} a handful of other Australian prawn trawl fisheries, specific turtle excluder devices (TEDs) are required to prevent turtles from entering the <b>codend</b> section <b>of</b> trawl nets. This article reviews international and Australian legal measures to protect turtles from prawn trawl fishing activities. It focuses on the difficult task fisheries officers in Queensland were presented with in 2002 when they attempted to prosecute two fishers for alleged non-compliance with their licence requirement to use a device which enables turtles to escape “immediately” after being taken in the net. A review is presented of this case which highlights the difficult task of securing convictions for alleged non-compliance with fisheries regulations where scientific uncertainty compounds the establishment of the required evidentiary burden of proof. The decision in the case exposes the challenge drafters of legislation face when they attempt to translate sound fisheries management objectives into effective and enforceable law...|$|R
40|$|In {{account of}} the {{decision}} of the IBSFC (International Baltic Sea Fisheries Commission) to admit alternative codend constructions to the presently legal of diamond meshes with 120 mm mesh opening, since seven years a vivid research activity is encouraged at the fishing technology institutions around the Baltic. Though a center of gravity in this field of research lies in the EUproject BACOMA (participants Finland Sweden, Denmark) also the corresponding national institutes of other Baltic countries (Germany, Poland, Russia) have been active with similar investigations. German experiments in 1999 dealt with the effect of the use of netting made of double instead of single yarn on the selectivity. Further research was done on modifications <b>of</b> <b>codends</b> made from netting turned 90 ° from its original orientation and on simplified versions of the so-called Multipanel <b>codend</b> which consists <b>of</b> three equal diamond and three square mesh panels. The experiments demonstrated on the one hand a definite deterioration of the selective properties in a codend made from double instead of single yarn. Constructional changes in codends made from netting turned 90 ° on the other hand brought a further improvement of the selectivity <b>of</b> such <b>codends.</b> Finally, the investigations on the Multipanel codend revealed the overwhelming influence of the square mesh panels on the selectivity success. If in a conventional diamond codend three windows are cut out starting 50 cm from the real end <b>of</b> the <b>codend</b> {{in such a way that}} the remaining parts have the same breadth as the square mesh panels to insert, the selective effect <b>of</b> such a <b>codend</b> is remarkably improved.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} escapes from <b>codend,</b> underneath <b>of</b> footrope and above head-line model in bottom trawl net widely used. Fishing trials {{were carried out}} between August 2006 and February 2007 with “EGESUF”. Different experiment bags, Rtext 620 and 24 mm mesh sizes, were constructed to obtain escaping species. Bosom bag was attached under the bottom model and rigged throughout the selvedge. Upper bag laced {{to the outside of}} headline above the upper model and cover was fitted over the codend. A nominal 40 mm polyethylene codend was used. The trawl catches were sorted into species. Length measurement was made in total length for abundant fish species which were annular sea bream (Diplodus annularis), red mullet (Mullus barbatus) and scald fish (Arnoglosus laterna). Non-parametric and para-metric statistical tests were applied to analyze data. A total of 24 933 specimens belonging to 34 species were caught from 9 valid hauls. Upper bag, bosom bag, covers and codend catch value were determined as 0. 1 %, 2. 8 %, 41. 6 % and 55. 6 %, respectively. While the highest Jaccard similarity coefficient was calculated 0. 50 between codend and cover, the lowest was 0. 05 between upper and bosom bag. Although there were significant differences between bosom bag, cover and codend for annular sea bream and scald fish specimen (Kruskal Walli...|$|R
