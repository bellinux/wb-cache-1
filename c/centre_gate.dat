60|$|Then, {{preceded by}} Caleb, they marched {{through the long}} cloisters, passed an inner door, turned down more cloisters on the right, and, {{following}} {{the base of the}} great wall, came to its beautiful <b>centre</b> <b>gate,</b> Nicanor, that was adorned with gold and silver, and stood between the Court of Women and the Court of Israel. Over this gateway was a square building, fifty feet or more in height, containing store chambers and places where the priests kept their instruments of music. On its roof, which was flat, were three columns of marble, terminated by gilded spikes. By the gate one of the Sanhedrim was waiting for them, that same relentless judge, Simeon, who had ordered Miriam to be searched.|$|E
50|$|Older pachinko {{machines}} had a spring-loaded lever {{for shooting}} the balls individually, but newer ones use a round knob {{that controls the}} strength of an electrically fired plunger that shoots the balls onto the playing field. When shot, the balls drop through an array of pins; {{some of them will}} fall into the <b>centre</b> <b>gate</b> and start up the slot machine in the centre screen. Every ball that goes into the <b>centre</b> <b>gate</b> results in one spin of the slot machine, but there is a limit on the number of spins at one time because of the possibility of balls passing through the <b>centre</b> <b>gate</b> while a spin is still in progress. Each spin pays out a small number of balls, but the objective is to hit the jackpot. The program of the digital slot machine decides the outcome of the spin when the ball falls through the <b>centre</b> <b>gate,</b> not when the spinning animation plays.|$|E
5000|$|This Centennial Flame {{was erected}} as a {{temporary}} monument, but due to great public support it still stands today. [...] It is located near the Queen's Gates (the <b>centre</b> <b>gate),</b> {{in front of the}} stairs leading to the Peace Tower and Centre Block. [...] The Centre Block is home to the House of Commons, the Senate and serves as an office building for MPs and Senators. The Centennial was celebrated across Canada in various ways; for example the re-enactment of the Battle of the Thames, the building of a destroyer out of match sticks, etc. [...] The government also encouraged the building of a Centennial memorial in each of Canada’s 10 provinces. The provincial and federal governments matched whatever the municipal government spent on their memorial, thereby encouraging the construction of grand buildings such as the National Arts Centre in Ottawa.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>centre</b> <b>gate</b> was {{constructed}} in 1883. The New Southport Gate (pictured above) was opened in the Charles V Wall to improve the flow of traffic. It {{was constructed}} {{during the reign of}} Queen Victoria and the term of Governor of Gibraltar General Sir John Miller Adye. It is ornamented with the coat of arms of the governor and that of Gibraltar, over which is the Royal Arms of Queen Victoria. In the 19th century, the Southport Ditch was the site of an ordnance [...] In the 1880s, the South Bastion featured four new rifled muzzle loading guns. A magazine was built in Southport Ditch at that time to store the ammunition needed for the new guns. Today, one of the guns (pictured below) is mounted just inside the Southport Gates. By 1908, the magazine had been converted to use as a pumphouse, as demonstrated on an Ordnance Survey map of that year.|$|E
50|$|During {{this time}} the Band has taken its place by the <b>centre</b> <b>gate,</b> formed up in a half-circle, where it plays music to {{entertain}} the New and Old Guard {{as well as the}} watching crowds. During this period, the two regimental colours are paraded up and down by the Ensigns (usually junior officers of 2nd Lieutenant rank or equivalent). With the Old and New Guards formed up once again, the Old Guard and the Band marches out through the centre gates in slow time to their Regimental Slow march played by the Band. At the end of the slow march the Captain of the Old Guard gives the word of command to 'Break into Quick Time' and with a brisk five pace roll from the drums, the Band leads the way back to Wellington Barracks.A detachment of the regiment on guard at Buckingham Palace and St James' Palace is also responsible for providing the guard at the Tower of London. As the Tower is still officially a royal residence, and is also the location of the crown jewels, it remains the army's obligation to guard it. The Tower guard numbers one officer, 3 NCOs and 10 soldiers, and usually posts a sentry outside the Jewel House and one outside the Queen's House. As the protection of the Tower is their responsibility (in conjunction with the Yeoman Warders), the guard must also see it is secure at night (see Ceremony of the Keys).|$|E
40|$|Structure-function {{correlations}} of the reconstituted carriers have been derived from inhibition studies.

40|$|A special mold with {{mechanically}} driven {{mold surface}} motions (rotation and axial) was developed allowing {{the imposition of}} different molding sequences, thus enlarging the possibilities of controlling the thermomechanical environment, and consequently the manipulation of the developed morphology. In this work, <b>centre</b> <b>gated</b> discs were injection molded with distinct rotation velocities of the mold surface. The moldings were characterized by several structure sensitive techniques. The imposition of a mold surface rotation has a marked effect on the morphology of the moldings, with novel molding morphologies being developed: a laminated skin–core structure featuring a dual shish-kebab structure differently oriented relatively to the flow direction, one {{in each of the}} skin layer...|$|R

The mechanical behaviour of the mouldings was characterized in tensile and flexural loadings on specimens cut at different locations along the flow length.

50|$|There {{used to be}} {{problems}} upstream of the lock's position because of the shallows known as Laleham Gulls, and various proposals were put forward to resolve them. There was a survey for a lock in 1793, but it was disallowed by parliament. In 1805 there was another proposal for a cut {{along the length of}} the current reach, with a pound lock at the lower end, but this was resisted by local landowners. A lock was authorised by parliament in 1810 a short way upstream, but when Lord Lucan asked to have the lock out of his view, a new Act in 1812 authorised it at the present lower site. The lock was opened in 1813 with the lock-house effectively on the Middlesex bank (although technically in Surrey because the course of the stream had been altered. The lock was lengthened in 1893 and again in 1913. It was then built with two compartments, but the <b>centre</b> <b>gates</b> have since been removed.|$|R
