Reports exist that attest that on occasion, people were fastened to rockets and blown into the air, this is said to have occurred for a Brahmin under Hyder Ali's reign (1761–1782), and also, in an 1800 treason case, in the Maratha Empire.|$|E

It is the third in a group of ten cantatas following the same structure of biblical text (in this <b>case</b> <b>from</b> the Old Testament) – recitative – aria – recitative – aria – chorale. The ten cantatas were dedicated to the 8th to 14th and 21st to 22nd Sunday after Trinity and the second Sunday after Easter.|$|E

40|$|Electrocardiographic {{studies have}} been carried out in 50 {{patients}} with acute cerebrovascular accidents. These cases included 31 <b>cases</b> <b>from</b> non-haemorrhagic group and 19 <b>cases</b> <b>from</b> haemor-rhagic group. `T&#x 2032; or T-U wave abnormalities were seen in 63. 1 &#x 0025; of cases in haemorrhagic group and in 35. 4 &#x 0025; of <b>cases</b> <b>from</b> non-hae-morrhagic group. Abnormal prolongation of QTc interval (105 &#x 0025; of normal i. e. 0. 45 Secs.) was observed in 73. 6 &#x 0025; <b>cases</b> <b>from</b> haemorrhagic group and in 35. 4 &#x 0025; of <b>cases</b> <b>from</b> non-haemorrhagic group. On comparing these two groups it was found that QTc was signi-ficantly more prolonged in patiens of haemorrhagic group than non [...] haemorrhagic group. The CSF pressure was found to be signi-ficantly more in patients with ECG abnormalities. However, there teas no correlation between serum electrolyte levels and ECG abnormalities. After 2 weeks, the ECG abnormalities disappeared, except in two <b>cases</b> <b>from</b> haemorrhagic group. There was no signi-ficant difference in the incidence of mortality between patient having ECG abnormalities and the patients without ECG abnormalities. In the light of these findings the probable mechanism of production of ECG changes in acute cerebrovascular accidents is discussed...|$|R

5|$|Significantly, the {{possibility}} that Dietrich may have been acquitted differentiates this <b>case</b> <b>from</b> the unsuccessful 1979 McInnis v R. appeal. McInnis, like Dietrich, had appealed to the High Court against his conviction, arguing that the failure to adjourn the proceedings while McInnis sought legal representation resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

5|$|In 2006, a {{researcher}} in Devon discovered {{a list of}} ingredients for a pasty tucked inside an audit book and dated 1510, calculating the cost of making a venison pasty. This replaced the previous oldest recipe, dated 1746, held by the Cornwall Records Office in Truro, Cornwall. The dish {{at the time was}} cooked with venison, in this <b>case</b> <b>from</b> the Mount Edgcumbe estate, as the pasty was then considered a luxury meal. Alongside the ledger, which included the price of the pasty in Plymouth, Devon, in 1509, the discovery sparked a controversy between the neighbouring counties of Devon and Cornwall as to the origin of the dish. However, the term pasty appears in much earlier written records {{from other parts of the}} country, as mentioned above.|$|E
5|$|In July 1963, police raided Liliesleaf Farm, arresting {{those they}} found there and {{uncovering}} paperwork documenting MK's activities, {{some of which}} mentioned Mandela. The Rivonia Trial began at Pretoria Supreme Court in October, with Mandela and his comrades charged with four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government; their chief prosecutor was Percy Yutar. Judge Quartus de Wet soon threw out the prosecution's case for insufficient evidence, but Yutar reformulated the charges, presenting his new <b>case</b> <b>from</b> December 1963 until February 1964, calling 173 witnesses and bringing thousands of documents and photographs to the trial.|$|E

40|$|Samples of tumours {{collected}} during necropsies or received from veterinary clinics, {{as well as}} biopsies were analysed.

Skin and subcutaneous tissue (45 % of dogs and 48 % of cats), and mammary gland (23 % of dogs and 29 % of cats) were the most common location of tumours. Malignant forms prevailed in dogs (59 %), cats (66 %), and horses (89 %). The analysis revealed interesting facts concerning the middle age of dogs and cats with tumours present with a peak in nine-year-old dogs and 10 - 12 -year-old cats...|$|R
5|$|Nearly all {{elements}} in the periodic table form binary bromides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each <b>case</b> <b>from</b> one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the noble gases, {{with the exception of}} xenon in the very unstable XeBr2); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond bismuth); and having an electronegativity higher than bromine's (oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine), so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not bromides but rather oxides, fluorides, or chlorides of bromine.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the earliest fragmentary remains that will {{come to be known as}} Deinosuchus, it was found that it was a relative of crocodiles, going as far as placing it in the same family (crocodylidae) in 1954, this assignment was mostly supported by dental features but was overturned in 1999 when the finding of new specimens from Texas and Georgia helped place Deinosuchus in a phylogenetic analysis, finding it in a basal position within the clade Alligatoroidea along with Leidyosuchus. This classification was bolstered in 2005 by {{the discovery}} of a well-preserved Deinosuchus brain <b>case</b> <b>from</b> the Blufftown Formation of Alabama, which shows some features reminiscent of those in the modern American alligator, Deinosuchus however, was not a direct ancestor of modern alligators.|$|E

5|$|The most {{noteworthy}} doping <b>case</b> <b>from</b> the 2007 Giro involved sprinter Alessandro Petacchi. Petacchi {{took five}} stage wins, {{but after the}} third of them, he tested non-negative for salbutamol, an asthma medication which Petacchi has a medical exemption to use. Petacchi was obligated as the stage winner to give a urine sample to the doping authorities, {{and it had a}} concentration of 1,352 nanograms per milliliter of salbutamol, above the 1,000 allowed by the medical exemption. Salbutamol has anabolic effects at high concentrations. Team Milram placed Petacchi on immediate provisional suspension following the Giro, which kept him from participating in the Tour de France later that season as he had planned. The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) asked the Italian Cycling Federation (FCI) for a one-year ban for Petacchi.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} all but {{its last}} moult, the caterpillar spins a cocoon out of silk. The cocoon {{can be in}} the tree crown or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an open network cocoon with large and irregular mesh. In the warm season, the cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin, the metamorphosis takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The chrysalis stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before eclosion, the motifs of the wings start to become visible. The moth emerges during the night or in low light, by splitting the pupal <b>case</b> <b>from</b> the top. Once out of the pupal exuvia (the pupal exoskeleton), the moth finds a horizontal surface, from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping haemolymph into the wing veins. The moth then beats them a few times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. The moth finally takes flight between one and a half to two hours later.|$|E
