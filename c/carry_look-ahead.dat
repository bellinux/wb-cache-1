40|$|The 74 LVC 169 is a {{synchronous}} presettable 4 -bit {{binary counter}} which features an internal <b>look-ahead</b> <b>carry</b> circuitry for cascading in high-speed counting applications. Synchronous operation {{is provided by}} having all flip-flops clocked simultaneously so that the outputs (pins Q 0 to Q 3) change simultaneously with each other when so instructed by the count-enable (pins CEP and CET) inputs and internal gating. This mode of operation eliminates the output counting spikes that are normally associated with asynchronous (ripple clock) counters. A buffered clock (pin CP) input triggers the four flip-flops on the LOW-to-HIGH transition of the clock. The counter is fully programmable; that is, the outputs may be preset to any number between 0 and its maximum count. Presetting is synchronous with the clock and takes place regardless of the levels of the count enable inputs. A LOW level on the parallel enable (pin PE) input disables the counter and causes the data at the Dn input to be loaded into the counter on the next LOW-to-HIGH transition of the clock.
