Eine simultane Applikation von Propofol mit Analgetika und Sedativa birgt das Risiko von Emulsionsinstabilitäten und Arzneimittelinkompatibilitäten. Aus diesem Grund wurde Propofol mit folgenden klinisch relevanten Analgetika und Sedativa sowie 0, 9 %iger Kochsalzlösung kombiniert und auf physikalische sowie chemische Kompatibilität getestet: Clonidin, Dexmedetomidin, γ-Hydroxybuttersäure, (S) -Ketamin, Lormetazepam, Midazolam, Piritramid, Remifentanil und Sufentanil. Insgesamt wurden 10 Zweierkombinationen in 3 Mischungsverhältnissen und 7 Mehrfachkombinationen makroskopisch, mikroskopisch, mittels pH-Wert-Messung, HPLC-, LC/MS- sowie LC-MS/MS-Analyse untersucht und zur Bestimmung der Emulsionsstabilität mittels Zetapotential-Messung, Turbiscan®-Analyse, Laserdiffraktometrie und Photonenkorrelationsspektroskopie analysiert. Anhand der Ergebnisse der Untersuchungen konnten 2 physikalisch inkompatible Kombinationen von Propofol mit Midazolam bzw. Piritramid ermittelt werden sowie 2 physikochemisch inkompatible Mischungen von Propofol mit γ-Hydroxybuttersäure bzw. Remifentanil.

Die physikalischen Inkompatibilitäten äußerten sich in Emulsionsinstabilitäten mit erhöhten Anteilen von Öltröpfchen > 5 µm. Die chemischen Inkompatibilitäten zeigten sich in Form eines pH-Wert-abhängigen hydrolytischen Abbaus des Remifentanils und in einer Propofol-Konzentrationsabnahme in Mischung mit γ-Hydroxybuttersäure. Eine vergleichende physikalische Untersuchung der Propofol-Emulsion mit einer weiteren Propofol-Emulsion sowie mit einer parenteralen O/W-Emulsion zeigte, dass das Kompatibilitätsverhalten nur auf identische Emulsionsformulierungen übertragen werden kann.

40|$|Strained-layer {{semiconductor}} films offer tremendous potential {{with regards}} to optoelectronic applications for high speed communications, mobile communications, sensing, and novel logic devices. It is an unfortunate reality {{that many of the}} possible film/substrate combinations that could be exploited technologically are off limits because of large differences in lattice parameters, chemical compatibilities, or thermal expansion rates. These mechanical, <b>chemical,</b> and thermal <b>incompatibilities</b> manifest themselves primarily in terms of lattice defects such as dislocations and antiphase boundaries, and in some cases through enhanced surface roughness. An additional limitation, from a production point of view, is money. Device manufacturers as a rule want the cheapest substrate possible. Freeing the heteroepitaxial world of the bonds of (near) lattice matching would vastly expand the types of working devices that could be grown. As a result, a great deal of effort has been expended finding schemes to integrate dissimilar film/substrate materials while preserving the perfection of the film layer. One such scheme receiving significant attention lately is the so-called compliant substrate approach...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{flexibility}} of electronic devices has {{attracted much attention}} from research due to the great demand in practical applications and rich commercial value. Integration of functional oxide materials in flexible polymer materials has proven {{an effective way to}} achieve {{flexibility of}} functional electronic devices. However, the <b>chemical</b> and mechanical <b>incompatibilities</b> at the interfaces of dissimilar materials make it still a big challenge to synthesize high-quality single-crystalline oxide thin film directly on flexible polymer substrates. This study reports an improved method that is employed to successfully transfer a centimeter-scaled single-crystalline LiFe 5 O 8 thin film on polyimide substrate. Structural characterizations show that the transferred films have essentially no difference in comparison with the as-grown films with respect to the microstructure. In particular, the transferred LiFe 5 O 8 films exhibit excellent magnetic properties under various mechanical bending statuses and show excellent fatigue properties during the bending cycle tests. These results demonstrate that the improved transfer method provides an effective way to compose single-crystalline functional oxide thin films onto flexible substrates for applications in flexible and wearable electronics...|$|R
40|$|Cement based mortars {{used for}} {{historic}} masonry restoration presented unsatisfactory results, {{due to their}} <b>chemical</b> and physico-mechanical <b>incompatibility</b> to original buildings. In the present research, several syntheses of restoration mortars are produced using traditional techniques and materials such as binders (aerial and natural hydraulic lime), pozzolanic additives (natural and artificial pozzolanas) and aggregates (sand and crushed brick). The technical characteristics of the mortars were determined using mechanical tests (compressive and flexural) and mercury intrusion porosimetry measurements {{at the time of}} 1, 3, 9, 15 months of curing. Water absorption measurements were performed at the time of 9 and 15 months curing, in order to evaluate mortars microstructural characteristics, their rate of water absorption and the total percentage of absorbed water. The aerial lime - artificial pozzolana mortar presented the best mechanical and microstructural performance. Hydraulic mortars acquired the maximum of the mechanical strength in 1 month, lime - pozzolana mortars in 3 months while aerial lime mortars continue to gain mechanical strength even in 15 months curing. Furthermore, the use of ceramic aggregates produces lightweight and elastic mortars, compatible to historic ones...|$|R
