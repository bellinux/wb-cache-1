5|$|Concerned that {{allegations}} of communists in the SCLC, if made public, would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives, Kennedy warned King to discontinue these associations, and later {{felt compelled to}} issue the written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the Civil Rights movement and investigated the {{allegations of}} communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> <b>tape</b> {{over the next five}} years in attempts to force King out of his leadership position, in the COINTELPRO program.|$|E
5|$|Toivonen's crash {{remains a}} mystery because it had no close witnesses. Although it was <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> <b>tape</b> by a spectator further down the stage, {{it proved to be}} {{impossible}} to determine the cause of the crash from the footage. No race marshalls were close to the scene to notice the black smoke and no-one at the race finish knew about the crash. Toivonen's team only started to fear something might have happened after he failed to arrive from the stage on schedule. The next rally crew through the stage then mentioned they had seen some black smoke. By the time the emergency vehicles arrived on the crash scene, they could only put down the flames, which had been fanned by breezes. Lancia engineers and technicians could not determine the cause of the crash because the remains of the car were so charred.|$|E

25|$|A rare tornado {{occurred}} {{in the capital of}} Colombia, Bogotá, and was <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> <b>tape.</b> There were no immediate word on any damage or injuries.

2500|$|Gary Moeller {{took over}} from Schembechler for the 1990 season, {{becoming}} the 16th {{head coach in}} Michigan football history. Moeller inherited a talented squad that had just played in the 1990 Rose Bowl, including wide receiver Desmond Howard. Moeller led Michigan to a 93 record in his first season, tying for the Big Ten championship but losing out on a Rose Bowl bid to Iowa. The next two years, Moeller's teams won the conference outright, setting marks of 102 and 903. In 1991, Desmond Howard had a memorable season that propelled him to win the Heisman Trophy, the award given to college football's most outstanding player. The 1992 team, led by quarterback Elvis Grbac, posted a 903 record, defeating Washington in the 1993 Rose Bowl. Moeller led Michigan to 84 records in both 1993 and 1994. The 1994 season was marked by an early-season loss to Colorado that included a Hail Mary pass from Kordell Stewart to Michael Westbrook to end the game, leading to the game being dubbed [...] "The Miracle at Michigan."

2500|$|The {{incident}} was <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> <b>tape</b> by a crew from the Spanish television company PVS, and the videotape showed that Kasparov's fingers were {{free of the}} knight for about 1/25 of a second, or a single frame of the video. Tournament director Carlos Falcon did not forfeit Kasparov when the videotape evidence was made available to him. As U.S. chess journalist Shelby Lyman pointed out, {{in the majority of}} sports [...] "instant replays" [...] do not overrule a referee's original decision and chess is no exception. The video has never been publicly released, at the request of tournament sponsor Luis Rentero. At one point Polgár reportedly confronted Kasparov in the hotel bar, asking him, [...] "How could you do this to me?" [...] Following this incident, Kasparov bluntly told an interviewer [...] "... she just publicly said I was cheating. ... I think a girl of her age should be taught some good manners before making such statements." [...] Subsequently, Kasparov refused to speak to her for three years. Kasparov told reporters that his conscience was clear, as he was not aware of his hand leaving the piece. Although Polgár recovered {{by the end of the}} tournament, she went into a slump over the next six rounds, gaining only half a point. The incident may also have had an effect on Kasparov, who turned out a subpar performance in the tournament.|$|E

40|$|A {{large portion}} of human {{intellectual}} and social life {{is based on the}} pro-duction, use, and exchange of relevant meanings in verbal discourse. This has endowed the human species with the ability to cope effectively with the crucial aspects of existence – knowing, behaving purposefully, planning, so-cializing, and communicating. Clearly, then, one of the primary tasks of semiotics is to identify and document how discourse unfolds and how it en-codes meanings. The purpose of this brief paper is to put forward a principle, as a target for discussion, which is proposed as a framework for studying the “meaning flow ” of discourse. It has been drafted here from previous work (e. g.
