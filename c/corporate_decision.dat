25|$|Traditional Aboriginal {{society had}} been governed by councils of elders and a <b>corporate</b> <b>decision</b> making process, {{but the first}} European-style governments {{established}} after 1788 were autocratic and run by appointed governors—although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies {{by virtue of the}} doctrine of reception, thus notions of the rights and processes established by the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights 1689 were brought from Britain by the colonists.

40|$|Using a 2004 Chinese {{securities}} {{regulation that}} requires equity offering proposals {{to obtain the}} separate approval of voting minority shareholders, we examine whether giving minority shareholders increased control over <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions</b> helps to reduce value-decreasing <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions</b> for firms domiciled in weak investor protection countries. We find that the regulation deters management from submitting value-decreasing equity offering proposals in firms with higher mutual fund ownership. There is also weak evidence that minority shareholders {{are more likely to}} veto valuedecreasing equity offering proposals in firms with higher mutual fund ownership in the post-regulation period. Overall, our evidence suggests that in weak investor protection countries, the effect of granting minority shareholders increased control over <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions</b> on the quality of <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions</b> depends on the composition of minority shareholders...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} way in which {{information}} about <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions</b> is reflected in stock prices. In the corporate finance literature a typical assumption is that managers have superior information that is revealed to the market by their <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions</b> and personal equity trades. In contrast, many market microstructure models assume that <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions</b> are exogenous and that informed agents are outside the firm. We formulate hypotheses that capture these views {{in the context of a}} seasoned equity issue. We consider insider trading and stock price movements from the time a firm files a prospectus through to the time that it decides to either complete or withdraw the issue. Evidence from 1, 081 equity registrations and insider trading during this interval supports the hypothesis that price movements are generated by informed outsiders, and that <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions</b> and managerial trading respond to these price movements. ...|$|R

25|$|During {{the early}} part of his tenure {{anchoring}} the CBS Evening News, Cronkite competed against NBC's anchor team of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, who anchored the Huntley-Brinkley Report. For much of the 1960s, the Huntley-Brinkley Report had more viewers than Cronkite's broadcast. A key moment for Cronkite came during his coverage of John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963. Another factor in Cronkite and CBS' ascendancy {{to the top of the}} ratings was that, as the decade progressed, RCA made a <b>corporate</b> <b>decision</b> not to fund NBC News at the levels that CBS provided for its news broadcasts. Consequently, CBS News acquired a reputation for greater accuracy and depth in coverage. This reputation meshed well with Cronkite's wire service experience, and in 1967 the CBS Evening News began to surpass The Huntley-Brinkley Report in viewership during the summer months.|$|E

Regarding this album, Diffie told Billboard that its material had a common theme of love, and {{that he wanted to}} create a more contemporary sound through the production. The album's title track peaked at number ten on the country charts and number 66 on the Hot 100.

500|$|The {{technical}} sophistication {{required to}} make modern video games and the high expectations of players {{make it difficult for}} independent developers to impress audiences viscerally, to the degree that large game makers with extensive budgets and development teams are able to, but innovation and quality need not necessarily be stymied. Europe, and Germany in particular, remains more receptive to PC-exclusives and, in general, to older, more [...] "hardcore" [...] design decisions. Like the movie industry, the indie video game scene plays a crucial role in formulating new ideas and concepts that mainstream publishers and marketing departments, stuck in their old ways, might otherwise deem unworkable or too radical. There are many examples that movies that never gained approval with the <b>corporate</b> <b>decision</b> makers were financially successful or became iconic on the film industry. Indie video game developers can provide more development time and effort whereas larger corporate enterprises are constrained by the expenses and expectations of voice-overs and advanced graphics. Independent developers can be successful in focusing on niche markets.|$|E
40|$|Does board {{composition}} {{matter for}} <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions?</b> In this paper, {{we focus on}} the effect of financial expertise, a requirement considered in regulatory proposals. We use a novel data set on board composition covering 288 companies over 14 years. We find that financial experts significantly affect <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions,</b> but mainly in the interest of their own institutions. We examine separately conflicts of interest due to commercial bank and investment bank affiliation. First, when commercial bankers enter boards, external funding increases and investment-cash flow sensitivity diminishes. However, the increased financing benefits mostly firms with good credit but poor investment opportunities. Commercial bankers appear to offer loans that benefit their own financial institutions. Second, investment bankers are associated with larger bond issues and worse acquisitions. They appear to maximize the fees accruing to their investment banks. Third, we find little evidence that financial expertise matters for <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions</b> when conflicts of interest are absent. Our findings suggest that requiring financial expertise o...|$|R

Although governance is based in the legal frameworks of agents and owners that underpin agency and stewardship theories, a raft of corporate scandals in the 1990 s and 2000 s shifted public expectations around corporate behavior and the role of directors and those guiding organizations. To deal with the societal impact of <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions</b> raised by these scandals, the notion of governance has broadened: first, to include moral claims and the concerns of stakeholders; and second, by spreading from corporations to other organizational types.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{contribute}} to the corporate finance literature by focusing on the interdependence of corporate investment, financing and payout decisions of UK-listed companies, within the period 1999 - 2008. After the introductory chapter, Chapter 2 critically reviews the existing literature on corporate investment, financing and payout policies. Chapter 3 investigates the interactions among the three <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions.</b> One of the key findings is that the three <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions</b> are likely to be jointly determined in the presence of financial constraints. The results also suggest that the effect of uncertainty on corporate investment is significantly positive, but the effect on dividend payout is significantly negative. Chapter 4 explores the influence of managerial confidence and economic sentiment on the set of jointly determined <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions.</b> An important finding is that the state of confidence at aggregate levels has significantly positive effects on both real investment and debt financing decisions. Chapter 5 discriminates conceptually and evaluates empirically twenty alternative measures of corporate investment used in the existing literature. It is found that conclusions drawn from empirical analysis are likely {{to be sensitive to the}} choice of corporate investment measures. The key findings of the thesis are summarised in the conclusion chapter...|$|R

40|$|The {{studies in}} this thesis {{contribute}} to a growing stream of papers showing that capital structure decisions are not only influenced by corporate determinants, but also by fluctuations in investor tastes and capital available for investment. This {{is a relatively new}} way of looking at <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions,</b> but is also given the deserved importance in the literature. This view contrasts with the traditional approach in the literature that largely considered <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions</b> to be distinct from the decision process of investors. Chapters 2 and 3 use convertible debt issuance to analyze the impact of intertemporal variation in investor demand on <b>corporate</b> <b>decisions,</b> and the market reaction to these decisions. Chapter 2 shows that convertible debt issuance, pricing, and design decisions are influenced by demand forces from investors. Chapter 3 finds that a shift in the convertible bond investor base from long-only investors towards convertible arbitrage funds resulted in an increasingly negative stock price reaction, induced by short-selling pressure. Thus, the first two studies {{in this thesis}} provide more evidence of corporate opportunism, using data on issuers of convertible debt. The fourth chapter uses data from repeat issuers of equity, and provides evidence in line with the hypothesis that investors take opportunism into account when firms issue new equity. In addition, the paper shows that firms’ choice of capital structure is influenced by their past behavior...|$|R
