Analysis {{is devoted to the}} progress payment method recommended by the Navy Task Group to Study Shipbuilding Progress Payments. An examination is made of both Government profit policy and <b>contract</b> <b>financing</b> as they relate to the shipbuilding industry. A computer model was developed which makes explicit the discounted cash flow in a given contract and displays all government payments to the contractor as well as the contractor's share of <b>contract</b> <b>financing.</b> The time-adjusted rate of return which is implied by the terms and conditions of the contract is computed by the model. A decision process for computing a profit negotiation position is developed which integrates (1) the IAC profit computation system, (2) the proposed shipbuilding progress payment method, and (3) the prevailing market conditions.

40|$|Current vascularization {{strategies}} for Tissue Engineering constructs, in particular cell sheet-based, {{are limited by}} time-consuming and expensive endothelial cell isolation and/or by the complexity of using extrinsic growth factors. Herein, we propose an alternative strategy using angiogenic cell sheets (CS) obtained from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue that {{can be incorporated into}} more complex constructs. Cells from the SVF were cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions for up to 8 days in the absence of extrinsic growth factors. Immunocytochemistry against CD 31 and CD 146 revealed spontaneous organization in capillary-like structures, more complex after hypoxic conditioning. Inhibition of HIF- 1 α pathway hindered capillary-like structure formation in SVF cells cultured in hypoxia, suggesting a role of HIF- 1 α. Moreover, hypoxic SVF cells showed a trend for increased secretion of angiogenic factors, which was reflected in increased network formation by endothelial cells cultured on matrigel using that conditioned medium. In vivo implantation of SVF CS in a mouse hind limb ischemia model revealed that hypoxia-conditioned CS led to improved restoration of blood flow. Both in vitro and in vivo data suggest that SVF CS can be used as simple and cost-efficient tools to promote functional vascularization of TE constructs. R. P.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 allows the use of performance-based payment (PBP) {{as an alternative to}} other forms of <b>contract</b> <b>financing.</b> According to the Department of Defense (DOD), the paying office processed about one million invoices for 363, 000 major contracts. In fiscal year 1999, only 195 of these contracts contained performance-based provisions. These contracts are so few in number because they are a relatively new form of contracting within DOD. In November 2000, however, DOD indicated that performance-based financing will be military's preferred <b>contract</b> <b>financing</b> method for future fixed-price contracts. This report reviews the C- 17 aircraft production program as a case study of the business processes used to make investment expenditures during the production phase of a major weapons system. GAO chose this contract because it is mature, stable, and is performance-based rather than cost-based. GAO found internal control weaknesses in the C- 17 program affecting compliance with regulations, policies, and procedures over (1) establishing withhold amounts by the Air Force contracting officer for conditionally accepted items, (2) processing by the Administrative Contracting Officer for performance-based payment requests, (3) processing by the Administrative Contracting Officer of invoices for delivered aircraft, and (4) processing of a delivery payment by the paying office at the Defense Finance Accounting Service Columbus Center on a contract containing performance-based payment provisions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine how three major defense {{acquisition}} programs (MDAPs) C- 17, Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), E- 2 C have used performance-based payments (PBP) and to determine what the important issues are, and how this method of <b>contract</b> <b>financing</b> might be enhanced in Department of Defense (DoD) contracts. Each of the MDAPs was reviewed to provide background about the acquisition program, and their use of PBP. A series of analyses was conducted {{to assess the impact}} of using PBP versus progress payments based on costs on a contractor's cash flow. Fourteen telephone interviews were conducted with DoD and defense contractors involved with PBP. Analysis led to concluding: regulation limits the use of PBP, PBP education and training is insufficient, the PEP payment process needs to be improved, PEP appear to facilitate timely deliveries, PEP are not suited for all procurements, and there are cases when PBP are advantageous. Recommendations to enhance PBP are: developing additional training/education and materials/programs, improving the payment end of PEP, incorporating "annual reevaluation" clauses in multi- ear contracts, and considering whether PBP are appropriatte.

40|$|Two {{financing}} modes can {{be considered}} for manufacturer’s production capital constrained: RPFM (retailer’s prepayment financing mode) and PCFM (procurement <b>contract</b> <b>financing</b> mode). Under the RPFM, the retailer places order in advance for a discount price and makes prepayment; manufacturer is able to finance from a bank as production quantity cannot satisfy the second-order quantity of retailer. By contrast, manufacturers make financing from commercial banks based on the procurement contract with upstream supplier under the PCFM. Taking into account the relation between production volumes with the manufacturer’s own capital and retailer’s order quantity, the optimal production and financing decision model for manufacturer under these two financing modes are built. Moreover, the profits of the manufacturer, the retailer, and the supply chain are compared and discussed. Results show that both of the two modes can create new value and profit for the supply chain with capital constraint and achieve optimal production under “newsvendor” mode; the supply chain has the better performance under the RPFM than that achieved under the PCFM. Also, under the RPFM, the manufacturer’s production and the profit of the whole supply chain would be increased when the manufacturer makes the second financing. Similar conclusion is reached under the PCFM. Finally, numerical study was given to demonstrate the conclusions...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to provide a}} comprehensive analysis of the issues surrounding the use of performance-based payments as a form of <b>contract</b> <b>financing</b> and to determine the major reasons why PBP have not been readily adopted in Department of Defense (DoD) contracts. In order to fully research, analyze, and evaluate the issues surrounding PBP and the reasons why they have not been readily adopted, two separate online surveys were developed and distributed. One survey was disseminated to DoD acquisition workforce personnel such as contracting officers and program managers. The second survey was distributed to contracting, program management, and acquisition personnel within the defense industrial base. Additionally, interviews were conducted with DoD personnel and defense contractors involved with PBP. Analysis led to concluding: training in PBP is inadequate, a lack of coordination exists between the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) and Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) in establishing PBP terms, the PBP payment process needs immediate improvement, and a culture change is still needed with DoD. Recommendations to expand the use of PBP are: develop a comprehensive training program on PBP, encourage the use of Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) in the PBP process, improve the payment process for PBP, and continue the strong push for the expansion of PBP usage.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Procurement regulations implemented in 1996 mandated that women-owned small businesses (WOSB) receive five percent of governmentwide contracts. Although the number of contracts awarded to WOSBs has risen {{more than four times}} as fast as other federal contracting efforts since 1996, the goal of awarding five percent of federal contracts to WOSBs has not been met. More agencies succeeded in meeting the WOSB subcontracting goal than their prime contracting goal. GAO found that three federal agencies [...] the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of State, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration [...] met or exceeded both goals in three of the four years it studied. Because the Department of Defense, which accounted for 64 percent of federal procurement in 1999, did not come close to achieving its five-percent goal, the governmentwide goal for prime contracting with WOSBs could not have been met even if all other federal agencies reached their prime contracting goals. Government officials cited many obstacles to increasing federal contracting with WOSBs, including a reduced contracting personnel force and the absense of a targeted WOSB government program. These contracting officers offered suggestions for increasing WOSB participation in federal contracting, including a strengthened outreach program and expanded excess to <b>contract</b> <b>financing.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Public debt {{incurred}} by developing countries {{has become an}} ardently debated issue in international relations. The competing interests of creditors and debtors, combined with the increasing necessity of advancing welfare worldwide, {{make it difficult to}} establish a workable scheme that provides adequate assistance to needy countries. Foreign aid is evidently part of the solution to development problems. However, conditions imposed by international lenders bring about certain discontents. The World Bank's negative pledge clause forbids a public borrower from securing external debt that is preferential to that of the Bank. This covenant also includes several exceptions: short-term secured banking transactions and financing, through the transfer of state-owned assets, are allowed. Moreover, only in exceptional circumstances does the Bank waive the clause's application. Thus, in order to secure foreign debt, a borrowing government is usually forced to <b>contract</b> <b>financing</b> that falls within the covenant's exceptions. This Paper analyzes the World Bank's negative pledge clause and compares it to the provisions used in commercial lending. It also reviews the historical tendencies and current trends with respect to sovereign borrowing, and concludes that the World Bank's negative pledge clause should be amended, in order to bring it closer to commercial practice. It is argued that the amendments proposed in this thesis will enhance the Bank's dual function and role as both a creditor and a development institution...|$|E

40|$|Prior to the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, {{the economic}} model of PPPs {{benefited from a}} very favorable environment in terms of credit availability and cost. The high level of liquidity in financial markets allowed rising abundant and not expensive external resources, because of both {{the low level of}} interest rates and the search by investors for financial assets characterize by these kinds of risk and revenue profiles. Such context was essential to help PPP deals to achieve their value for money requirement as it allowed minimizing the additional cost of private funds, compared to public ones. Indeed, the sovereign debt is considered as immunized from default risk. As a consequence, no risk premium is charged on public debt. So, it would be automatically more expansive to finance procurement through private funds than public ones. The financial attractiveness of PPPs, despite this handicap, could be both explained by intrinsic qualities of such deals in terms of incentive capacities and by this initial financial context, which conduce to such a private funding structure to present a very limited additional cost compared to sovereign bonds. The credit crunch compromised the viability of deals, which are funded through project finance structures with high levels of debt. Funds are more and more difficult to rise and are more and more costly, even for deals for which the counterpart is a public body. Additionally, the disappearance of monoline insurers, which guaranteed to the investors the repayment of the project entity debt through their AAA financial rating, contribute to limit the capacity of project managers not only to fund them with a limited risk premium but also to obtain a debt maturity, which match with the project one. Consequently, mini-perm structures, which are not a novelty in long-term contracts, tend to be more and more frequent after the financial crisis. Our purpose, in the framework of this communication, is to assess the possible consequences of such financial structures on the opportunity of PPPs for the public contractor. After presenting in a first part the increasing use of mini-perm structures after the 2008 crisis {{as a consequence of the}} major disruption in the <b>contract</b> <b>financing</b> model, we describe, in a second one, its potential repercussions, both in favorable and unfavorable situations. Our conclusion will put the accent on the analysis of financial and budgetary consequences of the additional risk induced by such structures for the public contractor. These consequences could be put in perspective with other devices used for preserving PPP financial structure as government guarantees...|$|E
