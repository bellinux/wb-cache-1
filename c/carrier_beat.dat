40|$|<b>Carrier</b> <b>beat</b> phase {{measurements}} of GPS are routinely used for precise positioning applications. However, before any position can be computed, the carrier ambiguity {{which is an}} inherent part {{of these types of}} observations should be correctly resolved. Otherwise, the computed positions are biased and their corresponding accuracies are drastically decreased. Ambiguity resolution is still a challenging problem in precise positioning applications. Finding a fast and reliable method for ambiguity resolution is notwithstanding an open area of research. Precise positioning computations using <b>carrier</b> <b>beat</b> phase observations usually involve three steps: 1. resolving ambiguities as float numbers, 2. assigning integer numbers to the resolved ambiguities (fixing ambiguities), and 3. testing the fixed ambiguities and computing accurate positions. Researchers have introduced many different methods to resolve the ambiguities. However, LAMBDA (Least square AMBiguity Decorrelation Adjustment) {{is one of the most}} powerful ones used so far. This paper discusses the effects of observation weight matrix on ambiguity resolution using LAMBDA method. Numerical results show that observation weight matrix has a direct effect on the accuracy of resolved float ambiguities. Moreover, in the process of fixing ambiguities using LAMBDA method, observation weight matrix determines the dimension of search space but it has no direct effect on fixing the ambiguities. Last but not least, it is shown that the result of adjustment using fixed ambiguities has not been much affected with the quality of the observation weight matrix unless it is unreasonably wrong. 1...|$|E

We demonstrate {{the effectiveness of}} our proposed algorithm on picture <b>carrier</b> <b>beat</b> type noise observed in a real-world situation involving the transmission of critical video signals obtained from a traffic monitoring system. We compare and contrast our results with a traditional linear time invariant (LTI) notch filter.

40|$|This {{report shows}} a new method to {{determine}} the high precision velocity of an aircraft using GPS <b>carrier</b> <b>beat</b> phase measurements in differential mode. For this a movable and a reference receiver are required. The receivers determine velocities {{in line of sight}} direction to each satellite.

The results of two stationary measurements show the better accuracy of the so-called receiver-epoch-double-difference method, especially in greater distances to the reference receiver.

40|$|From March to August 1990, {{the signals}} {{transmitted}} by the Block II satellites of the GPS were dithered under {{a policy of}} 'Selective Availability' (SA).

5000|$|The two FM audio {{channels}} {{occupied the}} disc spectrum at 2.3 and 2.8 MHz on NTSC formatted discs and each channel had a 100 kHz FM deviation. The FM audio carrier frequencies {{were chosen to}} minimize their visibility in the video image, so that even with a poorly mastered disc, audio <b>carrier</b> <b>beats</b> in the video {{will be at least}} ‑35 dB down, and thus, invisible. Due to the frequencies chosen, the 2.8 MHz audio carrier (Right Channel) and the lower edge of the chroma signal are very close together and if filters are not carefully set during mastering, there can be interference between the two. In addition, high audio levels combined with high chroma levels can cause mutual interference, leading to beats becoming visible in highly saturated areas of the image. To help deal with this, Pioneer decided to implement the CX Noise Reduction System on the analog tracks. By reducing the dynamic range and peak levels of the audio signals stored on the disc, filtering requirements were relaxed and visible beats greatly reduced or eliminated. The CX system gives a total NR effect of 20 dB, but in the interest of better compatibility for non-decoded playback, Pioneer reduced this to only 14 dB of noise reduction (the RCA CED system used the [...] "original" [...] 20 dB CX system). This also relaxed calibration tolerances in players and helped reduce audible pumping if the CX decoder was not calibrated correctly.|$|R

This adjustment ensures that the sums and differences of the sound carrier and the color subcarrier and their multiples (i.e., the intermodulation products of the two carriers) are not exact multiples of the frame rate, which is the necessary condition for the dots to remain stationary on the screen, making them most noticeable.|$|R

5000|$|Since the {{pulses of}} carrier have no audio modulation, a CW signal {{received}} by an AM radio receiver simply sounds like silence. In {{order to make}} the carrier pulses audible in the receiver, a beat frequency oscillator is used. The BFO is a radio frequency electronic oscillator that generates a constant sine wave at a frequency fBFO that is offset from the intermediate frequency fIF of the receiver. This signal is mixed with the IF before the receiver's second detector (demodulator). In the detector the two frequencies add and subtract, and a beat frequency (heterodyne) in the audio range results at the difference between them: faudio = |fIF - fBFO| which sounds like a tone in the receiver's speaker. During the pulses of <b>carrier,</b> the <b>beat</b> frequency is generated, while between the pulses there is no carrier so no tone is produced.

The word heterodyne {{is derived from the}} Greek roots hetero- [...] "different", and -dyne [...] "power". In radio applications the term derives from the [...] "heterodyne detector" [...] pioneered by Canadian inventor Reginald Fessenden in 1905, describing his proposed method of producing an audible signal from the Morse code transmissions of the new continuous wave transmitters. With the older spark gap transmitters then in use, the Morse code signal consisted of short bursts of a heavily modulated carrier wave, which could be clearly heard as a series of short chirps or buzzes in the receiver's headphones. However, the signal from a continuous wave transmitter did not have any such inherent modulation and Morse Code from one of those would only be heard as a series of clicks or thumps. Fessenden's idea was to run two Alexanderson alternators, one producing a carrier frequency 3kHz higher than the other. In the receiver's detector the two <b>carriers</b> would <b>beat</b> together to produce a 3kHz tone thus in the headphones the Morse signals would then be heard as a series of 3kHz beeps.

Autocorrelation measurements reveal long dephasing times up to T 2 = 1. 16 +- 0. 05 ps for positively charged excitons.

The influence of Landau level broadening and spin-dependent scattering rates on the observation of beating in the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations is investigated by simulations of the magnetoconductance. Data with non-zero beat node amplitudes are accompanied by asymmetric peaks in the Fourier transform, which are successfully reproduced by introducing a spin-dependent broadening in the simulations.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with modulation and beat detection for sinusoidal carriers. In the first experiment, temporal modulation transfer functions (TMTFs) were measured for carrier frequencies between 1 and 10 kHz. Modulation rates covered the range from 10 Hz to about the rate equaling the critical bandwidth at the carrier frequency. In experiment 2, TMTFs for three carrier frequencies were obtained {{as a function of}} the carrier level. In the final experiment, thresholds for the detection of either the lower or the upper modulation sideband (beat detection) were measured for 2 ̆ 2 carrier 2 ̆ 2 frequencies of 5 and 10 kHz, using the same range of modulation rates as in experiment 1. The TMTFs for carrier frequencies of 2 kHz and higher remained flat up to a modulation rate of about 100 – 130 Hz and had similar values across carrier frequencies. For higher rates, modulation thresholds initially increased and then decreased rapidly, reflecting the subjects' ability to resolve the sidebands spectrally. Detection thresholds generally improved with increasing carrier level, but large variations in the exact level dependence were observed, across subjects as well as across <b>carrier</b> frequencies. For <b>beat</b> rates up to about 70 Hz (at 5 kHz) and 100 Hz (at 10 kHz), beat detection thresholds were the same for the upper and the lower sidebands and were about 6 dB higher than the level per sideband at the modulation-detection threshold. At higher rates the threshold for both sidebands increased, but the increase was larger for the lower sideband. This reflects an asymmetry in masking with more masking towards lower frequencies. Only at rates well beyond the maximum of the TMTF did detection for the lower sideband start to be better than that for the upper sideband. The asymmetry at intermediate frequency separations can be explained by assuming that detection always takes place in filters centered above the stimulus spectrum. The shape of the TMTF and the beat-detection data reflects a limitation in resolving fast amplitude variations, which must occur central to the inner-ear filtering. Its characteristic resembles that of a first-order low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of about 150 Hz...|$|R
40|$|High {{electric}} field Hall measurements on InAs and InSb epilayers grown on GaAs show that electron energy loss at high fields occurs via plasmon, coupled plasmon-phonon and optical phonon emission, even in intrinsic inSb at 300 K. A simple 'catchment' model {{based on these}} energy loss mechanisms is developed and provides {{an excellent fit to}} #mu#(E), the mobility variation with applied {{electric field}}. Using this model, an estimate of the plasmon cutoff wavelength to within #approx# 10 % is possible for weakly degenerate or degenerate electron gases. An increase in the carrier concentration up to a factor of 3 is observed at high fields, and demonstrates that estimates of the saturation drift velocity made using I-V curves and an assumption of constant carrier concentration are invalid in these materials. It is commonly assumed that the beat patterns observed at low temperatures in the quantum magneto-resistance (QMR) of many high mobility semiconductor heterostructures are due to the presence of two Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) series of slightly differing periods. The appearance of a second series is attributed to a 'Zero Field Spin Splitting' arising from the quantum well potential (Rashba) asymmetry and the beat pattern is used to derive a value for the spin-orbit coefficient (#alpha#_ 0). We present QMR measurements on gated InAs/GaSb quantum wells over an extended temperature range, 0. 4 K < T < 31 K. At high <b>carrier</b> concentrations, a <b>beating</b> is observed which arises from a mixing of the first subband SdH series and a magneto-intersubband oscillation, the onset of which occurs when the Fermi energy is close {{to the bottom of the}} second subband. It is only at the lowest concentrations where the well asymmetry is minimal that beat patterns due to two narrowly split SdH series are observed. This splitting energy is found to be dependent on magnetic field, dropping from #approx# 4. 8 meV at B = 0 T to #approx# 3. 2 meV at B 1. 3 T. In contrast, no beating is found in gated InAs/AISb wells at 4. 2 K over the largest concentration range yet reported in a single sample (4. 8 x 10 " 1 " 1 cm"-" 2 < n < 2. 4 x 10 " 1 " 2 cm"-" 2). The Heusler alloy NiMnSb is identified as a candidate for an electrical spin injector for InAs. A simple technique for the fabrication of bulk NiMnSb targets for laser ablation is detailed, and attempts at laser ablation of NiMnSb thin films are reported.
