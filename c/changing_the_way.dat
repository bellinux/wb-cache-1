5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of {{protocols}} that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an Internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.|$|E

40|$|Information and {{communications}} technology (ICT) is <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which knowledge is being collected, processed, stored, presented and transmitted. Moreover, it is <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which course contents are presented and delivered to users.

This trend requires a new analysis of the information and knowledge presentation in order to facilitate creating of an active learning situation and to support exploratory activities. Dealing with this matter, the paper describes a beneficial virtual learning space for engineering educational activities. It points out the significance of shaping hypermedia contents with Virtual Reality components and interactivity features, which support the learner’s imaginative and learning abilities, allow to freely move through the virtual world, to experiment with its elements, and to seek for further information.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, says: While the radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases may be determined to a reasonably high degree of accuracy... the uncertainties relating to aerosol radiative forcings remain large, and rely to a large extent on the estimates from global modelling studies that are difficult to verify at the present time.

25|$|Stock Rotation is the {{practice}} of <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> inventory is displayed on a regular basis. This is most commonly used in hospitality and retail - particularity where food products are sold. For example, {{in the case of}} supermarkets that a customer frequents on a regular basis, the customer may know exactly what they want and where it is. This results in many customers going straight to the product they seek and do not look at other items on sale. To discourage this practice, stores will rotate the location of stock to encourage customers to look through the entire store. This is in hopes the customer will pick up items they would not normally see.|$|E

In one case, a poor boy from Iraq applied for admission to the yeshiva but could not provide the necessary tuition.

25|$|Shania Twain {{became the}} best selling female country {{artist of the}} decade. This was {{primarily}} due {{to the success of}} her breakthrough sophomore 1995 album, The Woman in Me, which was certified 12x platinum sold over 20 million copies worldwide and its follow up, 1997's Come On Over, which was certified 20x platinum and sold over 40 million copies. The album became a major worldwide phenomenon and became one of the world's best selling albums of 1998, 1999 and 2000; it also {{went on to become the}} best selling country album of all time. Unlike the majority of her contemporaries, Twain enjoyed large international success that had been seen by very few country artists, before or after her. Critics have noted that Twain enjoyed much of her success due to breaking free of traditional country stereotypes and for incorporating elements of rock and pop into her music. In 2002, she released her successful fourth studio album, titled Up!, which was certified 11x platinum and sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Twain has been credited with breaking international boundaries for country music, as well as inspiring many country artists to incorporate different genres into their music in order to attract a wider audience. She is also credited with <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which many female country performers would market themselves, as unlike many before her she used fashion and her sex appeal to get rid of the stereotypical 'honky-tonk' image the majority of country singers had in order to distinguish herself from many female country artists of the time.|$|E
