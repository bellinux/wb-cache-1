Because of this, DOCSIS systems experience relatively few collisions, {{in contrast to the}} pure <b>contention-based</b> MAC CSMA/CD employed in older Ethernet systems (there is no contention in switched Ethernet).|$|E
5000|$|The chief {{difference}} between Slotted and Reservation ALOHA {{is that with}} Slotted ALOHA, any slot is available for utilization without regards to prior usage. Under Reservation ALOHA's <b>contention-based</b> reservation schema, the slot is temporarily considered [...] "owned" [...] by the station that successfully used it. Additionally, Reservation ALOHA simply stops sending data once the station has completed its transmission. As a rule, idle slots are considered available to all stations that may then implicitly reserve (utilize) the slot on a contention basis.|$|E
5000|$|Bi Directional TXOP allows an AP and non-AP (STA or client) to {{exchange}} {{a sequence of}} uplink and downlink frames during a reserved time (transmit opportunity or TXOP). This operation mode is intended {{to reduce the number}} of <b>contention-based</b> channel accesses, improve channel efficiency by minimizing the number of frame exchanges required for uplink and downlink data frames, and enable stations to extend battery lifetime by keeping Awake times short. This continuous frame exchange is done both uplink and downlink between the pair of stations. In earlier versions of the standard Bi Directional TXOP was called Speed Frame Exchange.|$|E

50|$|The Chaosnet {{protocol}} originally used an implementation over CATV {{coaxial cable}} {{modeled on the}} early Xerox PARC 3 megabit/second Ethernet, the early ARPANET, and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). It was a <b>contention-based</b> system intended to work over a 0-1000 meter range, that included a pseudo-slotted feature intended to reduce collisions, which worked by passing a virtual token of permission from host to host; successful packet transmissions updated each host's knowledge of which host had the token at that time. Collisions caused a host to fall silent for a duration depending on {{the distance from the}} host it collided with. Collisions were never a real problem, and the pseudo-slotting fell into disuse.|$|E
30|$|The hybrid {{protocols}} aim {{to obtain}} a tradeoff between the <b>contention-based</b> protocols and slotted protocols. Usually, the hybrid DSA protocol divides time axes into synchronized slots. In each slot, SUs compete for transmission through <b>contention-based</b> methods. The performance of the hybrid protocols are usually better than that of <b>contention-based</b> protocols and the complexity is {{lower than that of}} slotted protocols.|$|E
30|$|Generally speaking, the <b>contention-based</b> {{protocols}} {{have the}} simplest architectures {{than the other}} kinds of protocols. However, the spectrum utilization efficiency and network performance are usually the lowest due to the serious packet collisions and inefficient spectrum competitions. The slotted protocols can usually achieve the best network performance compared with the <b>contention-based</b> and hybrid protocols. However, the protocol design {{of this kind of}} protocols is the most complex because a series of problems are needed to be considered, such as synchronization mechanism and slot allocation strategy. The hybrid protocols try to achieve the tradeoff between <b>contention-based</b> and slotted protocols. Therefore, the performance of hybrid protocols usually outperforms that of the <b>contention-based</b> protocols and the complexity is lower than that of the slotted protocols.|$|E
30|$|MAC {{protocols}} {{currently available}} in the literature can be broadly classified into two groups. The first group of MAC protocols are <b>contention-based</b> protocols, where nodes contend for channel access and collisions are possible. The 802.11 MAC protocol [2] {{which is based on}} carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) and Aloha system [3] constitute two well-known examples of <b>contention-based</b> MAC protocols. Although they are widely used, <b>contention-based</b> MAC protocols are known to provide inferior performance in multihop wireless mesh/ad hoc networks, especially when the number of contending nodes is increased [1].|$|E
30|$|According to {{different}} spectrum access modes, distributed dynamic spectrum access protocols {{can be divided}} into three categories, which are <b>Contention-based,</b> Slotted, and hybrid protocols, respectively [11, 14]. In the <b>contention-based</b> protocols, spectrum access is usually implemented by carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism, which is similar as the mechanism in IEEE 802.11 DCF standard [20, 21, 23, 24, 41, 43, 44, 50]. In the slotted protocols, a unique slot is assigned for each SU, thus interference-free transmissions are available for SUs [25, 40]. Hybrid protocols aim to derive the tradeoff between the <b>contention-based</b> protocols and slotted protocols. This kind of protocol is usually based on the ON/OFF model. In each slot, SUs compete for the spectrum according to the <b>contention-based</b> protocols [22, 26, 27, 35, 39, 42, 52].|$|E
30|$|Based on Table 1, we {{can observe}} {{that most of}} {{existing}} distributed DSA protocols belong to the <b>contention-based</b> protocols and hybrid protocols, only T-MAC [40] and C-MAC [25] are slotted protocols. The reason for such phenomenon is that the design of slotted protocols {{is more complex than}} the design of <b>contention-based</b> and slotted protocols. However, generally speaking, the slotted protocols can realize better performance than the other kinds of protocols. As shown in Figures 6 and 7, compared with the DSA-MAC [20], which belongs to the <b>contention-based</b> protocol, the throughput and delay of T-MAC are significantly improved.|$|E
40|$|Bandwidth {{allocation}} schemes {{have been}} well studied for mobile cellular networks. However, there is no study about this aspect reported for IEEE 802. 11 <b>contention-based</b> distributed wireless LANs. In cellular networks, bandwidth is deterministic {{in terms of the}} number of channels by frequency division, time division, or code division. On the contrary, bandwidth allocation in <b>contention-based</b> distributed wireless LANs is extremely challenging due to its <b>contention-based</b> nature, packet-based network, and the most important aspect: only one channel is available, competed for by an unknown number of stations. As a consequence, guaranteeing bandwidth and allocating bandwidth are both challenging issues. In this paper, we address these difficult issues. We propose and study nine bandwidth allocation schemes, called sharing schemes, with guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) for integrated voice/video/data traffic in IEEE 802. 11 e <b>contention-based</b> distributed wireless LANs. A guard period is proposed to prevent bandwidth allocation from overprovisioning and is for best-effort data traffic. Our study and analysis show that the guard period is a key concept for QoS guarantees in a <b>contention-based</b> channel. The proposed schemes are compared and evaluated via extensive simulations...|$|E

40|$|Fifth {{generation}} (5 G) wireless {{networks are}} expected to support very diverse applications and terminals. Massive connectivity {{with a large number}} of devices is an important requirement for 5 G networks. Current LTE system is not able to efficiently support massive connectivity, especially on the uplink (UL). Among the issues arise due to massive connectivity is the cost of signaling overhead and latency. In this paper, an uplink <b>contention-based</b> sparse code multiple access (SCMA) design is proposed as a solution. First, the system design aspects of the proposed multiple-access scheme are described. The SCMA parameters can be adjusted to provide different levels of overloading, thus suitable to meet the diverse traffic connectivity requirements. In addition, the system-level evaluations of a small packet application scenario are provided for <b>contention-based</b> UL SCMA. SCMA is compared to OFDMA in terms of connectivity and drop rate under a tight latency requirement. The simulation results demonstrate that <b>contention-based</b> SCMA can provide around 2. 8 times gain over <b>contention-based</b> OFDMA in terms of supported active users. The uplink <b>contention-based</b> SCMA scheme can be a promising technology for 5 G wireless networks for data transmission with low signaling overhead, low delay, and support of massive connectivity.

40|$|Abstract—We propose ORCHESTRA, {{a channel}} access pro-tocol that uses {{reservations}} and virtual MIMO to provide high throughput and bounded channel access delays.

A survey of MAC protocols for WBAN is studied in [16]. <b>Contention-based</b> MAC protocols such as carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocols have no strict time synchronization constraint {{which makes it}} scalable and easy to deploy, such as typical T-MAC [17], WiseMAC [18], and S-MAC [19]. The performance of IEEE 802.15. 6 CSMA/CA focusing on throughput and delay is introduced in [20]. The CSMA/CA mechanism of IEEE 802.15. 6 under non-saturation regime and saturation condition is introduced in [21] and [22], respectively. However, <b>contention-based</b> MAC protocols suffer some flaws when designed for WBANs: idle listening, overhearing, and frequency collisions cost too much unnecessary energy, and the network may endure performance deterioration. Though some proposed energy-harvesting MAC protocols such as [23] following the CSMA/CA rules that allow relay nodes to charge their batteries, sometimes battery recharge is difficult and the energy efficiency of MAC protocol is the prime consideration.|$|E

30|$|In general, MAC {{protocols}} can {{be roughly}} {{divided into two}} main categories: (1) contention-free protocols that avoid collisions among transmission nodes, and (2) <b>contention-based</b> protocols where nodes compete for a shared channel, resulting in the probabilistic coordination.

These protocols have been widely used in modern cellular communication systems. <b>Contention-based</b> protocols include random access (ALOHA, slotted ALOHA) [25, 26], and collision avoidance with handshaking (MACA, MACAW) [27, 28], which is the basis of several widely-used standards including IEEE 802.11.|$|E
