Cocoa was taken from plantation area around North Sumatra - Indonesia. Solar energy {{is used as a}} source of energy that save and clean for drying. Cocoa is a mainstay in Indonesian commodities, but quality of the current generated is relatively low. The aims of this research to gain the quality with mathematical modelling of drying by producing a good quality of <b>cocoa.</b> <b>Preparation</b> phase started from cocoa fermentation process.

40|$|It {{is renowned}} the {{importance}} of trade balance for maintaining macroeconomic equilibrium. So, {{the objective of the}} study was to identify main products in Brazilian agricultural exports from 1989 to 2012 and, secondly, to describe the identified products and formulate questions for future investigations. There is a trend for positive increasings in nominal level of agricultural exports. Substantive correlation between mean values and median values exported was also highlighted, something that can suggest the presence of products concentrating revenues. Moreover, increasing in mean values of agricultural exports was greater than increasing in mean values of global Brazilian exports, particularly from 2000. In terms of frequency in exported items, fruits and meat and edible meat offal must be cited. At second level in terms of frequency in export items there are animal and vegetable fats and oils, <b>cocoa</b> and <b>cocoa</b> <b>preparations,</b> preparations of vegetables and tobacco and manufactured tobacco. It is also remarkable specific codes of <b>cocoa</b> and <b>cocoa</b> <b>preparations,</b> sugars and sugar confectionery, and fruits, for example. Further studies can investigate potential increasing of consumption of those items in global markets and Brazilian perspectives in such scenario...|$|R

India exported $415.45 {{million worth of}} goods to Ecuador, and imported $137.69 million in 2015-16. The main commodities exported by India to Ecuador are mineral fuels/oils, wood and wood articles, <b>cocoa</b> and <b>cocoa</b> <b>preparations,</b> aluminum and related articles, machinery and mechanical appliances, lead, copper, zinc and articles thereof, and miscellaneous manufactured articles. The major commodities imported by India from Ecuador are mineral fuels/oils, iron and steel, pharmaceutical products, vehicles, organic chemicals, plastics and related articles, machinery and mechanical appliances, electrical machinery and equipment, rubber and articles.|$|R

40|$|Research {{studies of}} {{fermentation}} effects on processed chocolate have been made. The {{purpose of this}} study was to see the effect of different levels of fermentation of <b>cocoa</b> <b>preparations</b> (pasta, fats and powder) to the chemical quality and flavor. Harvested Cocoa beans will be treated fermentation. The treatment used was the time of fermentation namely: (A) Non fermentation, (B) Imperfect fermentation (4 days) and (C) Perfect fermentation (5 days). The parameters observed was: (a) chemical quality namely water content, fat content, pH, (b) organoleptic tests namely color, aroma, taste bitter (bitterness), texture. The results showed that fermentation of cocoa beans have real impact on levels of fat, water content and pH. Panelists gave the highest rankings for quality of organoleptic attributes of pasta, fat and chocolate powder from perfectly fermented beans. Processing of cocoa beans into refined products had levels of depreciation for each stage. 100 kg dried cocoa beans could produce 79. 0 kilograms of chocolate paste, 48. 7 kg of cocoa powder, and 26. 5 kg of fat. Fermentation for 5 days is the best solution to improve the quality of processed chocolate...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} {{oriented}} by two goals. First, it aims to measure the magnitude of thetariff used by the European Union (EU) on the agricultural products. Second, it triesto identify the existence of tariff discrimination among the groups of agriculturalproducts in the European tariff set. The hypothesis {{is that there is}} tariff discriminationin the EU agricultural tariff schedule. Theoretical and empirical studies have alreadysuggested that there are groups of products particularly protected by the EU agriculturaltariffs. The present work has one main contribution: the discussion related to theeffects of using different prices to the conversion of EU specific and composed tariffs. The study points to certain sets of agricultural products targeted by the EU trade policy:especially meat, sugar, residues and waste from food industries; and, at second,tobacco, meat <b>preparations,</b> cereals, <b>cocoa</b> and <b>preparations,</b> cereal preparations, dairyproducts, and organic quimical products. ...|$|R
40|$|Basic of <b>cocoa</b> bean <b>preparation</b> {{process is}} fermentation. Fermentation is done {{especially}} {{to improve and}} build specific chocolate flavour of cocoa bean and its products, i. e. cocoa liquor, butter, and powder; and also to decrease the disliked flavors, like bitter and acid. Research of cocoa bean fermentation was hold on in Subak Abian Pucaksari, Tabanan. This research involved 20 cooperative farmers with 0, 5 hectare farm area per each farmer. The treatment used was time of cocoa bean fermentation, i. e. without fermentation, not fully fermentation (4 days), and fully fermentation (5 days). Variables observed were dried cocoa beans physic and chemical quality, and also cocoa products chemical and organoleptic quality. Organoleptic test done to cocoa liquor and powder was descriptive and ranking test used 15 semi-trained panelists. The result showed that the fermentation process had significant influence to dried cocoa beans chemical quality and its products. Fermentation had no significant influence to dried cocoa beans physic quality. For organoleptic quality attributes, all panelists gave the highest rank for cocoa liquor and powder prepared from fully fermented cocoa bean...|$|R
40|$|A {{small scale}} {{cylindrical}} type cocoa roaster {{has been designed}} to improve Indonesian mallholder income and commence utilization of cocoa-base products. Capacity of the roaster was at 15 kg dried cocoa beans. Operating condition of the instrument in terms of temperature and duration of roasting for cocoa powder production has been optimized by using Response Surface Methodology in the range of 110 – 140 C for the former and 20 – 60 minute for the latter. Variable of the study were temperature profile, peroxide value of cocoa butter, color and sensory properties of the resultant cocoa powder and microbial con tamination. Result of the study showed that cocoa bean’s temperature at the first 2 – 8 minute roasting was 30 – 50 C, before increased as high 10 C per minute to the adjusted temperature. Temperature and duration of roasting influenced interactively on peroxide value of cocoa butter, color and sensory properties of the resultant cocoa powder. An optimum roasting for <b>cocoa</b> powder <b>preparation</b> was obtained at temperature of 140 C and roasting time of 20 minute. Roasting treatment significantly reduced number of microbe in total plate count, however most probable number (MPN) of coliform in term of Escherichia coli was not detected.
