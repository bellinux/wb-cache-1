5|$|In May 2003, Wilson {{appeared}} in a pictorial and {{on the cover of}} Playboy magazine. A few months earlier, when her pictorial was announced, a short storyline feud with Nidia developed, with the latter being jealous of the fact that Wilson was chosen for the cover and spread in the magazine. In weekly vignettes aired on SmackDown!, both Nidia and her on-screen boyfriend Jamie Noble made trips to The Playboy Mansion to <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> Hugh Hefner over his choice.|$|E
5|$|In later times, {{the term}} has {{continued}} {{to be used to}} describe conservative letter writers who <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> newspapers about a subject that they morally or personally disagree with. It is often used in relation to news stories regarding Royal Tunbridge Wells. Some residents of the town have criticised the term as being obsolete, but several continue to embrace it.|$|E
5|$|Taft {{remained}} {{involved in}} Philippine affairs. During Roosevelt's election campaign in 1904, he urged that Philippine agricultural products {{be admitted to}} the U.S. without duty. This caused growers of U.S. sugar and tobacco to <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> Roosevelt, who remonstrated with his Secretary of War. Taft expressed unwillingness to change his position, and threatened to resign; Roosevelt hastily dropped the matter. Taft returned to the islands in 1905, leading a delegation of congressmen, and again in 1907, to open the first Philippine Assembly.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure of}} Coastal Command to acquire any {{tangible}} results prompted the Admiralty to <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> the Air Ministry on 5 November 1940. In December {{it was agreed}} that 15 of the planned new 100 RAF squadrons be given to Coastal Command. These were to be operational by 1941. In the interim, four aircraft were to be given to each of the squadrons to bolster their strength, while a further Beaufort fighter and Beaufort torpedo bomber squadron were also made available.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Puerto Rico, in January 1521, he {{received}} the terrible news that the Dominican convent at Chiribichi had been sacked by Indians, and that the Spaniards of the islands had launched a punitive expedition, led by Gonzalo de Ocampo, into {{the very heart of}} the territory that Las Casas wanted to colonize peacefully. The Indians had been provoked to attack the settlement of the monks because of the repeated slave raids by Spaniards operating from Cubagua. As Ocampo's ships began returning with slaves from the land Las Casas had been granted, he went to Hispaniola to <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> the Audiencia. After several months of negotiations Las Casas set sail alone; the peasants he had brought had deserted, and he arrived in his colony already ravaged by Spaniards.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the game, feeling insulted, Tregubov {{refused to}} shake his hand. Two days after the game, Tregubov and his team would <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> arbiters about his suspect strong play, and his {{frequent}} toilet breaks. On the second day, Bindrich had the black pieces against Sebastian Siebrecht and on move 10, he took a second toilet break. Siebrecht, having played such cheaters as Christoph Natsidis in the past, suspected that he was using an analysis program on his smartphone. On Bindrich's return an arbiter asked to search him and that he give over his smartphone, which under tournament rules, the refereee is allowed to do. Bindrich refused to hand it over, saying that there was private information on the phone, and he was forfeited the game.|$|E

5|$|Hartnett {{felt the}} strain of {{managing}} a team during the 1939 season as he faced player discontent over the pampering of Dizzy Dean while pitcher Larry French went over his head to <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> owner Philip Wrigley about his lack of pitching assignments. French felt he was being punished for requesting to have Gus Mancuso as his catcher. In addition, Hartnett was forced to catch more games {{due to the lack}} of hitting from the other Cubs catchers. On August 28, 1939, he broke Ray Schalk's Major League record of 1,727 career games as a catcher. His record for longevity was surpassed by Al López during the 1945 season.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy was {{released}} from his WWE contract on May 29, 2009, just four days after his return. In a March 2010 interview with wrestlezone.com, Ken Anderson explained his release was due to fellow wrestler Randy Orton complaining to WWE management that Anderson was reckless in the ring, citing a botched backdrop that caused Orton to land {{on his head and}} neck instead of on his back. Orton argued that this could potentially end his career. According to Anderson, Randy Orton also persuaded his friend and fellow wrestler John Cena to <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> Vince McMahon about Anderson's in ring performance, which prompted McMahon to release Kennedy from his contract.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{worked there}} in adverse {{conditions}} for the following months, being constantly harassed by the Spanish pearl fishers of Cubagua island who traded slaves for alcohol with the natives. Early in 1522 Las Casas left the settlement to <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> the authorities. While he was gone the native Caribs attacked the settlement of Cumaná, burned {{it to the ground}} and killed four of Las Casas's men. He returned to Hispaniola in January 1522, and heard the news of the massacre. The rumours even included him among the dead. To make matters worse, his detractors used the event as evidence of the need to pacify the Indians using military means. The tragic outcome of Las Casas's great mainland adventure made him turn his life in a new direction.|$|E

5|$|Savaric first {{appears in}} the {{historical}} record in 1157 when he is named as a canon of Coutances Cathedral in Normandy. He then was archdeacon of Countances from 1162 to 1174. He was Treasurer of Salisbury in 1174 and archdeacon of Northampton from 1175 to 1187. The medieval chronicler Ralph Diceto says that a Savaric was appointed as Archdeacon of Canterbury, but whether {{this was the same}} Savaric is unclear. He incurred large debts to King Henry II of England, which caused the king to <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> Pope Urban III. During the years 1182–1184, Savaric was deprived of his archdeaconries, which may have been connected to the debt issue with the king.|$|E

Notable cut scenes include Jim and Pam discussing the situation surrounding the reception, Dwight placing his business card in the books in the church's pew, Jim and Pam discussing naming CeCe and thanking their friends and family for coming.|$|E
5|$|After Godwin left England, {{he went to}} Flanders, and {{gathered}} a fleet and mercenaries to force the king to allow his return. In the summer of 1052, Godwin returned to England and was met by his sons, who had invaded from Ireland. By September, they were advancing on London, where negotiations between the king and the earl were conducted {{with the help of}} Stigand, the Bishop of Winchester. When it became apparent that Godwin would be returning, Robert quickly left England with Bishop Ulf of Dorchester and Bishop William of London, probably once again taking Wulfnoth and Hakon with him as hostages, whether with the permission of King Edward or not. Robert was declared an outlaw and deposed from his archbishopric on 14September 1052 at a royal council, mainly because the returning Godwin felt that Robert, along with a number of other Normans, had been the driving force behind his exile. Robert journeyed to Rome to <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> the pope about his own exile, where Leo IX and successive popes condemned Stigand, whom Edward had appointed to Canterbury. Robert's personal property was divided between Earl Godwin, Harold Godwinson, and the queen, who had returned to court.|$|E

5|$|After his forced retirement, Peng lived alone, under {{constant}} surveillance from the Central Guard Unit of the PLA, {{accompanied by a}} secretary and a bodyguard. His wife remained in Beijing; and, due to her work as the Party secretary of Beijing Normal University, was only able to visit infrequently. Peng's guards prevented curious local farmers from visiting Peng, until Peng threatened to <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> Mao. Peng's niece, Peng Meikui, visited frequently, and the two became close. Peng {{spent most of his}} free time renovating his home, gardening, and studying Marxist theory, agriculture, and economics. Peng was not completely purged: even though he could not participate in government meetings or decision-making bodies, he still received and read all documents distributed {{to the members of the}} Politburo and State Council, which he was technically still a member of. In 1960 Peng attended the funeral of Lin Boqu.|$|E
5|$|Luna {{was one of}} {{the first}} to see action in Manila on 13 August 1898, when the Americans landed troops in Intramuros. Since June 1898, Manila had been {{completely}} surrounded by the revolutionary troops. Colonel Luciano San Miguel occupied Mandaluyong; General Pío del Pilar, Makati; General Mariano Noriel, Parañaque; Colonel Enrique Pacheco, Navotas, Tambobong, and Caloocan. General Gregorio del Pilar marched through Sampaloc, taking Tondo, Divisoria, and Azcárraga; Noriel cleared Singalong and Paco, and held Ermita and Malate. Luna thought the Filipinos should enter Intramuros to have joint occupation of the walled city. But Aguinaldo, heeding the advice of General Wesley Merritt and Commodore (later Admiral) George Dewey, whose fleet had moored in Manila Bay, sent Luna to the trenches where he ordered his troops to fire on the Americans. After the chaos following the American occupation, at a meeting in Ermita, Luna tried to <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> American officers about the disorderly conduct of their soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{record of}} {{improvements to the}} river is recorded in a document of 1325 from the Dean and Chapter of Wells Cathedral, where it was proposed to widen the river between Ham Mill and a new mill {{which was to be}} built at Knapp. The Dean and Chapter owned the river as far as Athelney weir, which was presumably a fish weir, as the river was an important source of fish for the local population. Records from 1494 record the intent to build a new mill at North Curry, which was operational in 1504, and caused flooding in 1505, resulting in the Bishop of Winchester having to <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> the Dean and Chapter of Wells. There is also mention of boats using the river at this time, as their use was restricted by the construction of the new mill at Ham.|$|E

5|$|After {{extensive}} {{development and}} pre-production which took four months for scripting, the film started the first schedule {{in the forests}} of Chalakudy in Kerala with Karthi, Reemma Sen and Andrea during October 2007. The project developed a reputation for its gruelling shoots, a novel concept in Tamil films, {{at an early stage}} of production. Thirty-five days into the shoot, Selvaraghavan gave a statement that the film was forty percent over and the film should release by May 2008 whilst also mentioning that rains in Kerala led to the budget going over expectations two months into the project. In January 2008, the unit moved to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan to shoot in the deserts in the region, however they were delayed again by unseasonal rains. Missing its original release date, the film's progress carried on through 2008, with shooting occurring {{towards the end of the}} year inside sets at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. In the studios, choreographer Shivshankar composed a classical dance for Reemma Sen and Parthiepan, and the sequence was shot over twenty days. Shooting carried on in sets for three more months with second half scenes being recorded. Shoots in all regions were tough and demanding for the crew as the film featured more than three thousand junior artistes from a variety of unions across India, with the language barrier becoming a problem. The project, eighteen months into shoot, soon began to face questions about its progress, with the producer, Ravindran, having to <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> the Tamil Film Producers Council that Karthi was trying to change his look for his next film, Paiyaa, following the long period he had spent with Aayirathil Oruvan. In February 2009, filming was completed after 263 days of shooting; therefore the producers signaled for a summer release but it was postponed by six months.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, {{was alarmed}} by this, {{both as a}} matter of principle, since Stephen had {{previously}} agreed in 1135 to respect the freedoms of the church, and more pragmatically because he himself had recently built six castles and had no desire to be treated in the same way. As the papal legate, he summoned the King to appear before an ecclesiastical council to answer for the arrests and seizure of property. Henry asserted the Church's right to investigate and judge all charges against members of the clergy. Stephen sent Aubrey de Vere as his spokesman to the council, who argued that Roger of Salisbury had been arrested not as a bishop, but rather in his role as a baron who had been preparing to change his support to the Empress Matilda. The King was supported by Hugh, Archbishop of Rouen, who challenged the bishops to show how canon law entitled them to build or hold castles. Aubrey threatened that Stephen would <b>complain</b> <b>to</b> the pope that he was being harassed by the English church, and the council let the matter rest following an unsuccessful appeal to Rome. The incident successfully removed any military threat from the bishops, but it may have damaged Stephen's relationship with the senior clergy, and in particular with his brother Henry.|$|E
