2500|$|A {{registered}} trademark confers {{a bundle of}} exclusive rights upon the registered owner, {{including the right to}} exclusive use of the mark in relation to the products or services for which it is registered. The law in most jurisdictions also allows the owner of a {{registered trademark}} to prevent unauthorized use of the mark in relation to products or services which are identical or [...] "colourfully" [...] similar to the [...] "registered" [...] products or services, and in certain cases, prevent use in relation to entirely dissimilar products or services. The test is always whether a consumer of the goods or services will be confused as to the identity of the source or origin. An example may be a very large multinational brand such as [...] "Sony" [...] where a non-electronic product such as a pair of sunglasses might be assumed to have come from Sony Corporation of Japan despite not being a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> that Sony has rights in.|$|E
2500|$|The law {{considers}} a trademark to {{be a form}} of property. [...] rights in relation to a trademark may be established through actual use in the marketplace, or through registration of the mark with the trademarks office (or [...] "trademarks registry") of a particular jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, trademark rights can be established through either or both means. Certain jurisdictions generally do not recognize trademarks rights arising through use. If trademark owners do not hold registrations for their marks in such jurisdictions, {{the extent to which they}} will be able to enforce their rights through trademark infringement proceedings will therefore be limited. In cases of dispute, this disparity of rights is often referred to as [...] "first to file" [...] as opposed to [...] "first to use." [...] Other countries such as Germany offer a limited amount of common law rights for unregistered marks where to gain protection, the goods or services must occupy a highly significant position in the marketplace— where this could be 40% or more market share for sales in the particular <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> or services.|$|E

I say there is no argument and no reason for such a course, and the only argument which could justify it is the argument used by Dr. Smartt at the Colonial Conference when he said (page 514 of the Blue Book), [...] "The foreigner pays, and we do not." [...] Mr. Deakin felt the force of the objection which would be entertained in this country to introducing such a tariff as the right hon. gentleman has proposed, simply for fiscal purposes, and he proceeded to say that Great Britain, if she was a party to such a bargain, should be permitted to raise the money in her own way, and to contribute her proportion to the common fund.

6000|$|As {{has been}} said, “the two great cheapeners of {{production}} are [...] {{division of labor}} and machinery, and the degree in which these [...] admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the [...] scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on. Those [...] manufactures, therefore, that are produced upon a large scale are [...] the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest [...] reduction in cost; in which, therefore, the fall in price, with [...] the progress of society, will be most marked. But the manufactures [...] which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which [...] there exists the largest demand—that is to say, are those which [...] enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of [...] people. They are also, I may add, those in which a fall in price [...] is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand. All the common [...] kinds of clothing, furniture, and utensils fall within the scope [...] of this remark; {{and it is in}} these, rather than in the commodities [...] consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes, that we [...] should, accordingly, expect to find the greatest marvels of [...] cheapening.” But the articles of common consumption are those in [...] which “the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a [...] smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the [...] more elaborate manufactures. Such coarser manufactures, therefore, [...] would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material [...] more sensibly than the refined sorts. Nevertheless, it can not be [...] supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes I have [...] pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts.

I'm {{not one of them}} that had need have a poor opinion of themselves, and be frightened at anybody else getting a chance.

And as to the extra outlay in schooling, I'm neither poor nor greedy--I wouldn't hang myself for sixpence, nor half a crown neither. But the truth of it is, the women and children are fond of Mordecai. You may partly see how it is, sir, by your own sense. A Jewish man is bound to thank God, day by day, that he was not made a woman; but a woman has to thank God that He has made her according to His will. And we all know what He has made her--a child-bearing, tender-hearted thing is the woman of our people. Her children are mostly stout, as I think you'll say Addy's are, and she's not mushy, but her heart is tender. So you must excuse present company, sir, for not being glad all at once. And as to this young lady--for by what you say 'young lady' is the proper term"--Cohen here threw some additional emphasis into his look and tone--"we shall all be glad for Mordecai's sake by-and-by, when we cast up our accounts and see where we are." ...|$|E

Here the period of production is longer, [...] {{the result of the}} process much more uncertain, the commodity at [...] once more perishable and less portable, and human requirements in [...] relation to it are mostly of a more urgent kind: (1.) The shortest [...] period within which additions can be made to the supply of food [...] and raw material of the vegetable kind is in general a year, and, [...] if the commodity be of animal origin, the minimum is considerably [...] larger. (2.) Again, the farmer may decide upon the breadth of [...] ground to be devoted to a particular crop, or upon the number of [...] cattle he will maintain; but the actual returns will vary [...] according to the season, and may prove far in excess or far in [...] defect of his calculations. These circumstances all present [...] obstacles to the adjustment of supply and demand, and consequently [...] tend to produce frequent and extensive deviations of the market [...] from the normal price. Nor are the other conditions of the case [...] such as to neutralize the influence of such disturbing agencies. [...] (3.) The nature, indeed, of some of the principal agricultural [...] products fits them sufficiently well for distant transport, and so [...] far tends to correct fluctuations of price. But, on the other [...] hand, (4.) the relation of these products to human wants is such [...] as greatly to enhance that tendency to violent fluctuation [...] incident to the conditions of their production. More especially is [...] this the case with the commodity, whatever it may be, which forms [...] the staple food of a people. For observe the peculiar nature of [...] human requirements with reference to such a commodity. They are of [...] this kind, that, given the number of a population, the quantity of [...] the staple food required is nearly a fixed quantity, and this [...] almost irrespective of price. Except among the poorest, increased [...] cheapness will not stimulate a larger consumption; while, on the [...] other hand, all, at any cost within the range of their means, will [...] obtain their usual supply. The consequence is that, when even a [...] moderate deficiency or excess occurs in the supply of the staple [...] food of a people, in the one case (a), the competition of [...] consumers for their usual quantum of food rapidly forces up the [...] price far out of proportion to the diminution in the supply; in [...] the other (b), no one being inclined to increase his usual [...] consumption, the competition of sellers, in their eagerness to [...] find a market for the superfluous portion of the supply, is [...] equally powerful to depress it.” ...|$|E
