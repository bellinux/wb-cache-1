5000|$|Marsala wine is {{frequently}} used in cooking, and is especially prevalent in dishes served in Italian {{restaurants in the}} United States. A typical Marsala sauce, for example, involves reducing the wine almost to a syrup with onions or shallots, then adding mushrooms and herbs. One {{of the most popular}} Marsala recipes is chicken marsala, in which flour-coated pounded <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> <b>halves</b> are braised in a mixture of Marsala, butter, olive oil, mushrooms, and spices. [...] Marsala is also used in some risotto recipes, and to produce rich Italian desserts such as zabaglione, tiramisu and shortcake.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the}} effects of the mixing ratio between pork loin and <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> for textural and sensory properties of emulsion sausages. Meat homogenates are prepared by using five mixing ratios between pork loin and <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> (100 : 0, 70 : 30, 50 : 50, 30 : 70, and 0 : 100), and the emulsion sausages are also formulated with five mixing ratios. The additions of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> increase the salt soluble protein solubility due to high pH levels of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast,</b> thereby resulting in the reduction of cooking losses. In addition, the apparent viscosity of meat homogenates increase with increas-ing amounts of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast.</b> In terms of emulsion sausages formulated with pork loin and <b>chicken</b> <b>breast,</b> the addition of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> above 50 % may contribute to a softer and more flexible texture of emulsion sausages. For sensory evalua-tions, an increase in the added amount of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> contributes to a rich umami taste and deeper flavor within the emul-sion sausages, resulting in the high overall acceptance score for the formulation of 0 - 30 % pork loin and 70 - 100 % <b>chicken</b> <b>breast.</b> Therefore, the optimal mixing ratios between pork loin and <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> are 0 - 30 % and 70 - 100 % for enhancing the textural and sensory properties of emulsion sausages.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the effects of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat {{on the quality of}} mackerel sausages. The mackerel sausages were manufactured by additions of 5 %, 7 %, and 10 % of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat. The lightness of mackerel sausages showed {{no significant differences between the}} control and addition groups. The redness increased in a dose-dependent man-ner, but the yellowness decreased significantly with the addition of 7 % <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat (p< 0. 05). The whiteness value of mackerel sausage added with 7 % <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat was significantly higher than those of the other groups (p< 0. 05). In texture analysis, the hardness and adhesiveness of the mackerel sausage added with 5 % of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat showed no significant differences as compared to the control. However, the mackerel sausages added with 7 % and 10 % of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat showed a dose-dependent decrease. The gel strength of the mackerel sausage added with 5 % <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat was not significantly different from the control, but the addition of 7 % and 10 % <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat reduced the gel strength of the mackerel sausage. In sensory evaluation, the mackerel sausages prepared with <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat have higher scores in smell, taste, texture, hardness, chewiness, and overall preference as compared to the no addition group. Therefore, these results suggest that the optimal condition for improving the properties within mackerel sausages was 5 % addition of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{disseminate}} knowledge regarding the perceptions of Spanish consumers of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> and their related lifestyles and to classify different consumer groups according to their food-related lifestyles. Nearly all Spanish consumers consume <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> once or twice per week. The preference for white or yellow chicken appears to be divided evenly, although the preferred is white <b>chicken.</b> <b>Chicken</b> <b>breast</b> is perceived as a product of convenience. Seventy percent of consumers buy <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> because it is easy to cook whereas only 27 % prefer to buy the entire chicken. Four groups of consumers based on their lifestyles and their perceptions of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> were identified: “Urban single”, “Traditional”, “Innovative precariat ” and “Gourmet”. These types of consumers are consistent with types other studies have identified in terms of the lifestyles associated with other foods. Defining groups of consumers with differentiated perceptions of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> is useful in managing marketing strategies to satisfy the various consumption needs associated with <b>chicken</b> <b>breast...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Chicken</b> <b>breast</b> {{was more}} {{resistant}} to various exogenous oxidative factors than beef loin: addition of NaCl did not increase TBARS values and nonheme content of raw <b>chicken</b> <b>breast,</b> but significantly increased those of raw beef loin patties during storage. Addition of NaCl+Mb did not affect lipid oxidation in raw <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> patties, but decreased the TBARS of beef loin during storage. Addition of NaCl+Fe(III) or NaCl+Fe(II) increased the TBARS values of both raw <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> and beef loin during storage, but the increase was greater in beef loin than in <b>chicken</b> <b>breast.</b> The TBARS values of all cooked <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> and beef loin increased during 7 -day storage, but the increases in cooked chicken patties were significantly smaller than those of cooked beef loin patties with the same treatments. Addition of NaCl and cooking caused severe degradation of myoglobin, leading to {{a significant increase in}} free ionic iron content in beef loin. It is suggested that free ionic iron is the major catalyst for lipid oxidation, and the high “storage-stable” ferric ionic reducing capacity and “heat-stable” ferric ion reducing capacity in <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> were responsible for the high oxidative stability for raw and cooked <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> compared with beef loin under prooxidants, cooking and storage conditions...|$|R

40|$|Tenderness or {{texture of}} <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> may be {{evaluated}} through measuring the force needed {{to lead to}} the rupture of muscle fibers. The aim of this paper was to quantify the muscle stiffening in <b>chicken</b> <b>breasts</b> which underwent fixing and storage in 10 % formaldehyde solution, throughout a year. The analyses were carried out in fresh <b>chicken</b> <b>breasts</b> (control group) and in samples at 7, 15, 30, 90, 180, and 360 days of conservation. The shear force varied from 3. 38 kgf (control group) to 17. 37 kgf (30 -day group). In the 15 -day conservation group there was a little force decrease (14. 74 kgf), when compared to the 90 (16. 94 kgf), 180 (16. 71 kgf), or 360 (15. 42 kgf) day groups.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to estimate the effect of temperature and develop predictive models for the growth of total viable cells (TVC) and Escherichia coli (EC) on <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> under aerobic and various temperature conditions. The pri-mary models were determined by Baranyi model. The secondary models for the specific growth rate (SGR) and lag time (LT), as a function of storage temperature, were developed by the polynomial model. The initial contamination level of <b>chicken</b> <b>breasts</b> was around 4. 3 Log CFU/g of TVC and 1. 0 Log CFU/g of E. coli. During 216 h of storage, SGR of TVC showed 0. 05, 0. 15, and 0. 54 Log CFU/g/h at 5, 15, and 25 oC. Also, the growth tendency of EC was similar to those of TVC. As storage temperature increased, the values of SGR of microorganisms increased dramatically and the values of LT decreased inversely. The predicted growth models with experimental data were evaluated by Bf, Af, RMSE, and R 2. These values indicated that these developed models were reliable to express the growth of TVC and EC on <b>chicken</b> <b>breasts.</b> The temperature changes of distribution and showcase in markets might affect the growth of microorganisms and spoilage of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> mainly.
