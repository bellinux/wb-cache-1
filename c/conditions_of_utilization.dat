As the {{advancement}} {{of the process of}} urbanization and the growth of population, the ratio of constructional energy consumption and the total energy consumption has multiplied rapidly in a short periods. At the mean while, the general energy source is limited which could not stand the huge pressure from energy consumption. However, as a kind of clean, green and effective energy, wind power draws more attention from countries than before. These countries began to focus on micro wind and put it into practice when developing large-scale wind power. The utilization of wind power in buildings is a type of micro wind utilization. This paper summarized the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>utilization</b> of winds in buildings and the installation form of wind generator in high-rise buildings. The limitation of utilization of wind is its instability. Through the idea of transformation of utilization and shortening its path, we can settle the basic problem of energy loss and storage. The study indicated that wind power generation is technique with the least environmental cost. From the prospect of life cycle, wind power technique only generates Carbon dioxide in constructional phase. As a result, under the condition of sufficient wind resource and reasonable system design, the technique of wind power integration design in buildings should have obvious economic benefits. ?

40|$|It {{is highly}} {{important}} {{to describe the}} capabilities of existing forest roads in terms of all the functions assigned to them in line with forestry objectives and to define their <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>utilization</b> in the future. This study aimed at determining and grading the factors that are required to make an evaluation concerning the forest roads and preparing an evaluation form for them. Twenty-three evaluation factors and indicators that subgroup these factors were defined to evaluate forest roads. The method of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to define the significance rates at the step of factor evaluation. Survey method was applied for expert group evaluation. Significance rates of the factors were found through {{an evaluation of the}} data obtained. After the significance rates of the factors that were regarded at the outset as significant factors for evaluation of roads were defined, factors having a significance rate of lower than 2 % were extracted and calculation was repeated accordingly.

40|$|Background: Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are a {{cornerstone}} of malaria control at present, and millions are used each day across the globe. However, there is limited information about the durability of LLINs under different <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>utilization</b> {{and there is no}} consensus about when a LLIN ceases to be protective due to physical deterioration. This knowledge is important for malaria control programmes to plan for procurement and replacement. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 208 households where Olyset® nets distributed five years ago were still present was conducted in the village of Sauri, western Kenya, {{in the context of the}} Millennium Villages Project. Information on bed net utilization and maintenance was collected in each household through a structured questionnaire, and one five-year-old Olyset® net from each sampled household was randomly selected and collected for physical examination. All holes larger than 0. 5 cm were measured in each net, registering their position, and a hole index was calculated following WHO guidelines. Nets were classified as in good condition, moderately damaged or badly torn based on the hole index. The analysis explored the associations between demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of households, patterns of bed net utilization and maintenance and physical condition of the nets. Additional analysis was conducted using malaria prevalence data collected in a separate survey to explore if there was any association between the condition of the net collected in a household and the presence of malaria parasites in members of that household. Results: 81. 4 % of Olyset® nets distributed five years ago were still present in the surveyed households, and 98. 97 % of the nets were reportedly used the previous night. Nets had an average of 34. 2 holes (95 % CI 30. 12 - 38. 22), and the mean hole index was 849 (95 % CI 711 – 986), IQR 174 – 1, 135. 15. 2 % of nets were still in good condition, 46. 1 % were moderately damaged and 38. 7 % were badly torn after five years of utilization. There was no association between household characteristics or patterns of bed net utilization or maintenance and physical condition of the nets. The only predictor of the physical condition of the net was the cleanliness at the time of examination. There was a difference of 17. 6 percentage points in the proportion of households with at least one blood smear positive for Plasmodium falciparum between households with a net in good condition (5. 3 %) and those with a moderately damaged or badly torn net (22. 9 %), 95 % CI (0. 04 - 0. 305), t= 2. 77 with unequal variance, p= 0. 009. Conclusions: Olyset® nets were used extensively in Sauri, western Kenya after five years of distribution, regardless of their physical condition. However, only 15 % were found in good condition. Nets in good condition seem to be still protective after five years of utilization, while nets with more than 100 cm 2 of holed surface may be associated with higher malaria parasitaemia at household level. Continued replacement of damaged nets and promotion of net maintenance and repair may be necessary to maintain the protective effectiveness of LLINs...|$|E
