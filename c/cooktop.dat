25|$|Cookware and {{bakeware}} are {{types of}} food preparation containers, {{commonly found in}} a kitchen. Cookware comprises cooking vessels, such as saucepans and frying pans, intended for use on a stove or range <b>cooktop.</b> Bakeware comprises cooking vessels intended for use inside an oven. Some utensils are considered both cookware and bakeware.|$|E
25|$|Aluminum is {{typically}} clad {{on both the}} inside and the exterior pan surfaces, providing both a stainless cooking surface and a stainless surface to contact the <b>cooktop.</b> Copper of various thicknesses is often clad on its interior surface only, leaving the more attractive copper exposed {{on the outside of}} the pan (see Copper above).|$|E
2500|$|Microwave ovens heat food {{without getting}} hot themselves. Taking a pot off a stove, {{unless it is}} an {{induction}} <b>cooktop,</b> leaves a potentially dangerous heating element or trivet that will stay hot for some time. Likewise, when taking a casserole out of a conventional oven, one's arms {{are exposed to the}} very hot walls of the oven. [...] A microwave oven does not pose this problem.|$|E

2500|$|Braising {{pans and}} {{roasting}} pans (also known as braisers and roasters) are large, wide and shallow, to provide space {{to cook a}} roast (chicken, beef or pork). They typically have two loop or tab handles, and may have a cover. Roasters are usually made of heavy gauge metal {{so that they may}} be used safely on a <b>cooktop</b> following roasting in an oven. Unlike most other cooking vessels, roasters are usually rectangular or oval. There is no sharp boundary between braisers and roasters – the same pan, with or without a cover, can be used for both functions. In Europe, a clay roaster [...] is still popular because it allows roasting without adding grease or liquids. This helps preserve flavor and nutrients. Having to soak the pot in water for 15 minutes before use is a notable drawback.|$|E
50|$|The DOE {{test cycle}} starts {{with both the}} block and the <b>cooktop</b> at room temperature: 77 °F ± 9 °F (25 °C ± 5 °C). The <b>cooktop</b> is then {{switched}} to maximum heating power. When the test block temperature reaches + 144 °F (+80 °C) above the initial room temperature, the <b>cooktop</b> power is immediately reduced to 25% ± 5% of its maximum power. After 15 minutes of operation at this lower power setting, the <b>cooktop</b> is turned off and the heat energy in the test block is measured. Efficiency is given by the ratio between energy in the block and input (electric) energy.|$|E

50|$|Compared to {{conventional}} kitchen stoves, glass-ceramic <b>cooktops</b> are relatively simple to clean, {{due to their}} flat surface. However, glass-ceramic <b>cooktops</b> can be scratched very easily, so {{care must be taken}} not to slide the cooking pans over the surface. If food with a high sugar content (such as jam) spills, it should never be allowed to dry on the surface, otherwise damage will occur.|$|R
