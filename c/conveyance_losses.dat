Water <b>conveyance</b> <b>loss</b> in the canals was measured by the inflow-outflow method, while water velocity was determined using a current-meter. Statistical relationships between canal types, canal shapes, and seepage loss were also investigated. The water <b>conveyance</b> <b>loss</b> at the main canal level was between 0. 5 % and 1. 3 % (0. 0071 - 0. 0126 l s- 1 m- 2) per 1 km in the left bank main canal, and between 0. 6 % and 8. 6 % (0. 0024 - 0. 0361 l s- 1 m- 2) per 1 km in the right bank main canal. The average loss was 3. 0 % (0. 0141 l s- 1 m- 2). At the secondary canal level the average water <b>conveyance</b> <b>loss</b> for the trapezoidal canals on the left bank was 2. 0 % (0. 0615 l s- 1 m- 2) per 100 m and for the concrete flumes on the right bank it was 4. 0 % per 100 m.

ABSTRACT: Bhavani basin is the fourth largest Sub Basin in the Cauvery basin. The entire command area of all three major canals that takes off from the Bhavani river falls within the Erode District i. e. Lower Bhavani Project (LBP), Kodiveri and Kalingarayan canals. The LBP canal is {{a major source of}} irrigation in Erode District. Many of these canals are unlined and leakage takes place from them. Thus the seepage from the canal helps in recharging the wells in the area, enabling to get adequate water supply for the crops when water was not released from Bhavanisagar Dam. In this study, the Groundwater recharge is determined by groundwater flow modeling using Visual MODFLOW model. For this purpose, three major natural sources of groundwater recharge are taken into consideration such as rainfall infiltration, canal seepage and return flow of irrigation. The model was run and ZONEBUDGET gives an idea about the amount of recharge from lined/unlined canal to the field. Unlined canal helps to recharge the groundwater about 20 % more than the lined canal. The analysis reveals that the annual rainfall also has rapidly changed in this region. In the LBP canal Head reach meets their requirement with available quantity of water from the canal system. Tail end reach does not receive the required quantity of water because of seepage <b>loss</b> and <b>conveyance</b> <b>loss.</b> Hence the lined canal can be provided for full length of the main canal.

A review of previous estimates for California suggests overall annual transfers of 5 % to 15 % from agriculture to urban and environmental uses over the forseeable future. A range of alternate transfer mechanisms is possible. Transfer effects on agricultural regions overlying groundwater aquifers will occur through a variety of mechanisms, are dynamic as the economic/hydrologic system responds, and will depend on the particular mechanism used. An empirical analysis is conducted for a representative region in California. Transfers via involuntary surface water cutbacks Atilt @ the extraction schedule, and lower water table levels and net benefits over time. The effects are large for the water table level, but more modest for the other variables. Break-even prices are calculated for voluntary quantity contract transfers at the district level. These prices differ considerably from what might be calculated under a static analysis which ignores water table dynamics.

40|$|Settlement Contract: 17 pages. Settlement Agreement: Contract {{between the}} US and the Jicarilla Apache Tribe (Dec. 8, 1992). Parties: Jicarilla Apache Nation and US. The {{contract}} {{will come into}} effect when certain decrees are entered, claims dismissed, and cases resolved. When a decree is entered in the water rights adjudication styled NM v. US of the NM San Juan River system added to the decree in NM v. Aragon, a second water rights adjudication in NM will fully describe the Nation’s reserved water rights, that is, diversion not to exceed 40 K acre-feet per year from the two stream systems. This water will come from in the Navajo River, Navajo Reservoir, and San Juan-Chama Project. The decree will also adjudicate rights held by the Nation under state law and to groundwater, ponds, and lakes within the Reservation. The Nation’s water rights may be sourced in ground or surface water. Many of these rights are subordinated to the contract. US will buy-out private water rights for 11 K acre-feet depletion in the San Juan River system. The Nation will assume all <b>conveyance</b> <b>losses.</b> It {{is responsible for the}} water made available under the contract. The Nation will share shortages in San Juan-Chama Project water. The Nation may lease its water off-reservation. The Nation will develop a water conservation program. [Source: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Water {{transfers}} from agricultural {{to urban}} and environmental uses will likely become increasingly common worldwide. Many agricultural areas {{rely heavily on}} underlying groundwater aquifers. Out-of-basin surface water transfers will increase aquifer withdrawals while reducing recharge, thereby altering {{the evolution of the}} agricultural production/groundwater aquifer system over time. An empirical analysis is conducted for a representative region in California. Transfers via involuntary surface water cutbacks tilt the extraction schedule and lower water table levels and net benefits over time. The effects are large for the water table but more modest for the other variables. Break-even prices are calculated for voluntary quantity contract transfers at the district level. These prices differ considerably from what might be calculated under a static analysis which ignores water table dynamics. Canal-lining implies that districts may gain in the short-run but lose over time if all the reduction in <b>conveyance</b> <b>losses</b> is transferred outside the district. Water markets imply an evolving quantity of exported flows over time and a reduction in basin net benefits under common property usage. Most aquifers underlying major agricultural regions are currently unregulated. Out-of-basin surface water transfers increase stress on the aquifer and management benefits can increase substantially in percentage terms but overall continue to remain small. Conversely, we find that economically efficient management can mitigate some of the adverse consequences of transfers, but not in many circumstances or by much. Management significantly reduced the water table impacts of cutbacks but not annual net benefit impacts. Neither the break-even prices nor the canal-lining impacts were altered by much.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} been made {{regarding}} the efficiency of water use in irrigation systems in operation. Therefore, in this work the search for methodologies to evaluate the actual efficiency of water use in a Mexican irrigation district as well as methods which may improve this efficiency is emphasized. The work has been divided into four parts. In the first part, {{the analysis of the}} economic activities in the irrigation district by means of linear programming has permitted finding the marginal productivity of water which is used as a shadow price for economic evaluation of the operating rules. In this part a relationship between the marginal productivity of water and the conveyance efficiency has also been found. In the second part, using hydrological historical data and a pattern of monthly water demand for crops obtained in the first part, control curves of the reservoir levels which permit knowledge of the probability of risk of spill and shortage were computed. Utilizing these curves and a simple linear programming model for finding the optimal economic annual average release, operating rules for the reservoir have been deduced. These rules were tested by means of a simulation model and their economic effectiveness was estimated using a benefit-cost analysis, showing a significant improvement in benefits for the farmers as a consequence of using these rules. In the third part, the <b>conveyance</b> <b>losses</b> in the canal network are analyzed using a linear regression between releases and deliveries. The proposed model permits an estimation of the conveyance efficiency and its division into two component factors, the intrinsic efficiency directly related to the physical characteristics of the canals, and the operational efficiency related to water management in the canal network. Knowing these components, it is possible to classify the <b>conveyance</b> <b>losses</b> as well as deduce operating rules for improving the operational efficiency. In making decisions about the methods to be used for improving the conveyance efficiency, benefits and costs must be taken into account. Therefore, a practical relationship for evaluating the economic feasibility of lining canals, considering those benefits and costs, is found as well as a method for economic evaluation of the operating rules. Finally, in the last part of this work, a practical methodology for estimating the application efficiency at the farm level in an irrigation district and small divisions as well is shown. This method is useful in finding where the problems in water use are more important within the district and which could be their principal causes. Utilizing data from experiments, which are available in most of the Mexican irrigation districts, production functions relating yields of crops to the amount of water applied and the percentage of moisture depletion in the soil before and during the flowering season of the crop, have been found. These functions can be used not only for obtaining the optimal economic depth of water to be applied and irrigation timing but also for deriving the optimal water use efficiency, whi 6 h, when related to actual values of this water efficiency in each subdivision of the district, permits the deduction of a practical water use efficiency index which is useful for detecting where the problems in water use are and what are the potential returns for the farmers in each of the considered subdivisions...|$|E
