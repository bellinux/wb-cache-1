The Crown contended that lading the goods on an armed merchant vessel of one of the conflicting states surrendered this neutrality to that state.

50|$|The law of {{fundamental}} breach was historically {{treated as an}} extension of the doctrine of deviation. The development of this doctrine can be traced down to the first half of the 19th century, when Tindal C.J. stated in Davis v. Garrett that deviation made by the carrier from the agreed voyage route brings the latter outside of contract and therefore outside of exceptions or limitation clauses provided by such a contract. This harsh attitude to deviation cases originated from the earlier marine insurance practice when cargo insurance policy was lost in case of deviation. Thereby strict obligations imposed to the carrier were designed to afford protection to the <b>cargo</b> <b>owner.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, {{the owner}} of the cargo is {{entitled}} under the contract of affreightment to the ordinary service of the ship and crew for the safe carriage of the cargo to its destination, and the shipowner is bound to pay all ordinary expenses incurred for the voyage. He must also bear all losses that arise from accidental damage to the ship. However, when the shipowner incurs extraordinary expense {{for the safety of the}} cargo, he can recover the expense from the cargo's owner as a special charge on cargo. Also, when the shipowner incurs an extraordinary expense or makes a voluntary sacrifice to save the ship and cargo from a common peril, he may require the <b>cargo</b> <b>owner</b> to contribute in general average.|$|E

50|$|The above {{legislations}} {{were the}} principle governing instruments of oil spills incidents {{prior to the}} Exxon Valdez oil spill. Several attempts by congress to establish more encompassing and elaborate oil pollution laws were hindered by belligerent issues which mostly produced stalemates. One such conflict was federal law limiting a state’s ability to enforce requirements and liability for parties responsible for causing oil spills. The focus of the debates was mostly centred on party liability. An example {{of the type of}} debates is illustrated in the question “who is liable {{in the case of a}} vessel spill?” The <b>cargo</b> <b>owner</b> or the ship operator/ owner? Another significant issue was the interaction of domestic legislation and international measures. In 1980’s, international agreements being considered would take over oil spills federal and state laws adding further complexity to party liability.|$|E
40|$|In {{the coming}} years the Arctic Ocean will become navigable for {{significant}} periods of time. Now {{is the time to}} consider the legal regime that will govern the arctic region, and the recent Polar Code is a major international step in that direction. Among the areas that need further attention before the Arctic becomes a major commercial highway is shipping liability. In particular, Canadian law may hold cargo owners liable for ship owners’ mistakes, errors, and omissions leading to oil spills in the Canadian Arctic. This peculiar <b>cargo</b> <b>owner</b> liability may be an uninsurable risk, and is therefore potentially destabilizing to firms that may not even appreciate their risk. Rather than getting rid of this protection entirely, however, this article proposes a solution to bring this facet of Canadian law into harmony with the Polar Code, preserving the additional protection afforded by <b>cargo</b> <b>owner</b> liability, while tempering it with principles from the Polar Code itself...|$|E

40|$|The {{transportation}} of oil {{represents one of}} the most strategically important movements of energy resources in the global economy (Rodrigue, 2004). However, shipping of crude oil between the Middle East and Europe and between the Middle East and the USA is moving through some of the world’s most pirate-infested waters, the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean being the most significant. This research project presents a study on the effect on operational cost of Somali piracy on crude oil shipping. The study quantifies the direct operational cost for <b>owners,</b> charterers and <b>cargo</b> <b>owners.</b> This includes ransoms, insurance premiums, security measures and rerouting of vessels. Creating an understanding of the operational impact that Somali piracy has on ship <b>owners,</b> charterers and <b>cargo</b> <b>owners</b> in the crude oil market is important for several reasons. • The global economy is highly dependent on oil (Green et. al., 2002). • The oil price and oil consumption are highly correlated with economic growth (Lee & Chiu. 2011) • Transport time has a significant impact when an oil importer selects export markets (Rodrigue, 2004). The operational cost of Somali piracy in this vital corridor for crude oil is thus important considerations when shaping government policies. For stakeholders such as oil companies, ship <b>owners,</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>owners,</b> and energy companies the quantification of the piracy-triggered cost is important in order to formulate appropriate strategies and operational practices (Fu et. al., 2010). The study area has been limited to crude oil shipping from the Middle East Gulf to Europe and to USA. The broader Middle East {{is the single most important}} oilproducing region in the world, while Europe and USA are major exporters and consumers (Rodrigue, 2004). IMO and IMB data have been thoroughly examined and sorted to establish a valid data sample of ship movements. Fixtures on the relevant route have also been thoroughly examined to establish commercial practices that can be relevant to include. Qualitative interviews with ship owners and charterers have been conducted and analysed. 5 This paper suggests that the piracy-triggered increase in direct economic cost to ship <b>owners,</b> charterers and <b>cargo</b> <b>owners</b> is significant. However it is hard to find an absolute quantification. Plymouth Business Schoo...|$|R

30|$|Container shipping, by comparison, {{requires}} significant complementary {{assets in}} the form of ports, chassis, trucks and trains to deliver goods to the beneficial <b>cargo</b> <b>owner.</b> Alliances sometimes require vessels to call on multiple terminals within a single port, making it take longer to unload cargo. Process innovation and implementation for enhanced SCI cooperation cannot be done without an adequate infrastructure or capabilities to support the vessel service. These specialized assets require a bilateral dependence between the ocean carrier and the owner of the complementary asset. For example, ocean carriers need to have marshalling yards (for stacks of containers awaiting pick-up) and terminal gate operations {{that are part of the}} port terminal. Warehouses for trans-loading in US, EU and other countries from ocean containers to domestic vans, and the return and marshalling of empty containers further add to the complexity.
