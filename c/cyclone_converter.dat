50|$|The HIsarna {{steelmaking}} {{process is a}} process for primary steelmaking in which iron ore is processed almost directly into steel. The process is based around {{a new type of}} blast furnace called a <b>Cyclone</b> <b>Converter</b> Furnace, which makes it possible to skip the process of manufacturing pig iron pellets that is necessary for the basic oxygen {{steelmaking process}}. Without the necessity for this preparatory step the HIsarna process is more energy-efficient and has a lower carbon footprint than traditional steelmaking processes.|$|E
50|$|The HIsarna {{ironmaking}} {{process is}} a direct reduced iron process for iron making in which iron ore is processed almost directly into liquid iron or hot metal. The process combines two process units, the <b>Cyclone</b> <b>Converter</b> Furnace (CCF) for ore melting and pre-reduction and a Smelting Reduction Vessel (SRV) where the final reduction stage to liquid iron takes place. The process {{does not require the}} manufacturing of iron ore agglomerates such as pellets and sinter, nor the production of coke, which are necessary for the blast furnace process. Without these steps, the HIsarna process is more energy-efficient and has a lower carbon footprint than traditional ironmaking processes.|$|E
5000|$|It is a {{combination}} of a <b>Cyclone</b> <b>Converter</b> Furnace (CCF) which is placed above the Smelting Reduction Vessel (SRV), forming a continuous, once through process. The HIsarna plant is shaped like a wine bottle: a [...] "bottle" [...] at the bottom and a thin [...] "neck" [...] at the top. The geometry of this furnace causes a cyclone to form in the neck when the crushed iron ore is injected into this cyclone together with oxygen (so oxygen is injected at the top rather than at the bottom). The heat of the cyclone causes the initial (partial) reduction reaction to take place that reduces iron ore to iron.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Cyclone</b> <b>Converter</b> Furnace (CCF) is an {{alternative}} ironmaking process which allows direct iron production from the virgin inputs (coal and iron ore). The reactor consists of two directly connected stages: a melting-cyclone for melting and pre-reduction of iron ore and a converter for final reduction into liquid metal.

The two-stage system involves {{the combination of a}} fluidized bubbling bed and a single carbon electrode plasma converter. Bed particles of mullite (3 Al 2 O 3 - 2 SiO 2) with coarse particle size (1 - 2 mm) are applied as solid inventory in the fluidized bed system. The waste is thermally decomposed within the fluidized bed to produce a crude syngas, containing residual tars, unconverted char and entrained ash particles. The crude syngas is then sent to the plasma <b>cyclone</b> <b>converter</b> where all the inorganic material (particulates and heavy metals components) are captured and immobilized into a vitrified slag. Experimental test runs with RDF waste were conducted by varying the operating conditions and contaminants quantity. The results are presented according to solid samples composition, gas composition, and further specific data (e. g., carbon conversion efficiency, leaching test, etc). Particulate loading data and materials mass balance suggested from 40 to 90 % of non-volatile metals (e. g. chromium) and other heavy metals (e. g. vanadium) were incorporated within the slag where they are rendered non-leachable. The work demonstrates the ability to process highly heterogeneous material achieving high energy conversion (87 - 94 %), high material recovery, and virtually complete carbon conversion, producing a very clean syngas capable of being used for power generation or as a chemical feedstock...|$|E
