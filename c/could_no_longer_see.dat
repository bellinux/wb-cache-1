25|$|For {{years before}} the war the South had been {{building}} a wall around its perimeter, to protect itself from dangerous agitators and subversive ideas, and now those inside the wall <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>see</b> over the top, out to what lay beyond.|$|E
25|$|The glass {{bulkheads}} {{behind the}} driving cabs were another {{casualty of the}} refurbishment - passengers <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>see</b> the driver's view through the front windows. Following refurbishment, units were repainted in the striking new orange and black livery introduced by the newly created Strathclyde PTE.|$|E

60|$|The lad made {{a little}} gesture of {{comprehension}} as he swung round, and Tomlinson gravely walked after him until they <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be <b>seen</b> from the shanty. Then Probyn turned to him again.|$|R
60|$|They sailed on {{the port}} tack {{for an hour and}} then came round again. The {{brigantine}} <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be <b>seen</b> from the deck, and could only just be made out from the crosstrees.|$|R
500|$|The {{other group}} {{not to be}} tolerated was people who wanted reform to go much further, and who finally gave up on the Church of England. They <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>see</b> it as a true church. They {{believed}} it had refused to obey the Bible, so they formed small groups of convinced believers outside the church. The government responded with imprisonment and exile to try to crush these [...] "separatists".|$|E
500|$|Otter and Staunch both fell rapidly behind Boadicea, while Africaine pulled far ahead. By 18:20, lookouts on Africaine <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>see</b> {{the other}} British ships, and by 18:30, Boadicea was {{similarly}} alone. Bouvet realised {{the lack of}} cohesion in the British squadron, and also recognised that Africaine was faster than either of his ships and would soon catch them. As a result, he slowed and prepared to meet the British frigate as night fell. Corbet now found himself outnumbered and began to launch rockets and flares {{in the hope of}} attracting Rowley's attention and as the French closed with Africaine, he readied his ship for action. [...] behind, Rowley could see the flares and flashes but was powerless to intercede in the darkness. At 01:50 on 13 September, the gap had closed between Africaine and the French ships, and at 02:20 Corbet opened fire on Astrée, with Bouvet returning the fire immediately.|$|E
500|$|By 10:00, Stettin had steam {{in all of}} her boilers, and {{was capable}} of her top speed. She {{therefore}} returned to the battle, and at 10:06, she encountered eight British destroyers and immediately attacked them, opening fire at 10:08. Several hits were observed in the British formation, which dispersed and fled. By 10:13, the visibility had decreased, and Stettin <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>see</b> the fleeing destroyers, and so broke off the chase. The ship had been hit several times in return, without causing significant damage, but killing another two and wounding another four men. At around 13:40, Stettin reached with the cruiser , which was just coming under attack from several British battlecruisers. Stettins crew could see the large muzzle flashes in the haze, which after having disabled Ariadne, turned on Stettin at 14:05. The haze saved the ship, which was able to escape after ten salvos missed her. At 14:20, she encountered [...] The German battlecruisers [...] and Moltke reached the scene by 15:25, by which time the British had already disengaged and withdrawn. Hipper, in , followed closely behind, and ordered the light cruisers {{to fall back on}} his ships. After conducting a short reconnaissance further west, the Germans returned to port, arriving in Wilhelmshaven by 21:30.|$|E
60|$|Diggory withdrew with an {{emphatic}} step, Wildeve's eye {{passing over}} his form in withering derision, {{as if he}} were no more than a heath-cropper.

50|$|A rematch with Stieglitz {{took place}} on March 23, 2013 in Stieglitz's home of Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany. Abraham's eye rapidly swelled shut {{in the second round}} and he <b>could</b> soon <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>see.</b> The referee waved him off {{at the start of the}} fourth round, {{resulting}} in his defeat.|$|R
60|$|I was mystified by Pierre's words, {{although}} surely by {{this time}} I should {{have come to understand}} that his odd speech betokened the perfecting of a plan, and I remained silent as if believing he would make sport of me, until two or three minutes had elapsed when Abel Hunt <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be <b>seen</b> in the gloom.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the turn}} of the 19th century, the facón became more of a utility and {{ceremonial}} weapon, though it was still used to settle arguments [...] "of honor". In these situations two adversaries would attack with slashing attacks to the face, stopping the fight when one of the participants <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>see</b> due to bleeding from shallow cuts.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{daughter}} Maria Eriksdotter {{testified that}} Malin took both her and several children to Satan in Blockula, and that Satan himself, [...] "The Mean One" [...] appeared in court, long, black and with horns, standing by her mother, holding {{her skirt and}} {{whispered in her ear}} never to confess. [...] Malin was ordered by the court to fall on her knees and pray to be able to confess, and after having obeyed, her daughter stated that she <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>see</b> the Devil.|$|E
2500|$|Survivors of {{the blaze}} {{claimed that the}} factory had sweatshop-like {{conditions}} and blamed the large loss of life on barred windows. The workers worked for [...] "well below minimum wage" [...] and endured foul smells, according to family of the victims and The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines. Pay was dependent {{on the number of}} shoes produced, creating wages as little as 300 pesos (US$6.70) in a 12-hour day (minimum wage is 481 pesos). Other survivors said that the company was not making required social security and health insurance payments. A survivor who escaped from the first floor remarked, [...] "They were screaming for help, holding on to the bars. When we <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>see</b> their hands, we knew they had died... they died because they were trapped on the second floor." [...] Another survivor remarked, [...] "We were running not knowing exactly where to go... if people had known what to do, it would have been different." ...|$|E
5000|$|The flow is {{generally}} a slow ooze however in 1974 workers clearing the nearby stream, Hancock's Water, described a jet of mud rising into the air. In 1990 an {{attempt was made}} to fill in the most active spring by putting [...] of rubble into it. This displaced mud which ran into Hancock's Water but the rubble <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be <b>seen.</b>|$|R
60|$|The watch was undisturbed, {{and soon}} it became so dark that objects <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be <b>seen</b> fifty yards away. Tom {{began to feel}} nervous. Every tuft of ground, every little bush seemed to {{him to take the}} form of a {{crawling}} Indian, and he felt a great sense of relief when he saw the figures round the fire rise and walk towards him.|$|R
5000|$|A new, smaller [...] "mini-park" [...] {{called the}} Pavilion Nostalgia Park has been created, {{featuring}} {{a few of}} the old rides and attractions, including the carousel and organ. This park, located at Broadway at the Beach, opened July 4, 2007. The organ was moved in June 2014 to where it <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be <b>seen,</b> and people complained, but Burroughs & Chapin planned to find a new location for it.|$|R
2500|$|The Hattie Gage {{was under}} command of Captain Erwin Ferrar who had 35 years of {{experience}} at sea, including 13 seasons in Alaska. The Kayak was under command of Captain Patrick Hamilton who recently obtained his captain license after 10 {{years of experience}} at see as mate and boatswain. Together with captain Wagner of the Star of Bengal, the captains decided {{to proceed with the}} tow, as the weather was calm. Captain Ferrar was placed in charge of the operation. The small flotilla left Fort Wrangell at 8:20a.m. making about [...] and planning to reach the open sea at Warren Island in 12 to 18 hours. The vessels passed point Baker at 3:50p.m., and reached the [...] strait between Coronation Island and Warren Island at 10:00p.m. By that time, the wind has strengthened, and the visibility was poor due to rain, mist, and darkness. The lookouts on both tugs <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>see</b> the Star of Bengal which was [...] behind them.|$|E
2500|$|... “I tied {{a string}} (tied to the wire) to Smoky's collar {{and ran to}} the other end of the culvert [...] [...] [...] (Smoky) made a few steps in and then ran back. [...] `Come, Smoky,' I said sharply, and she started through again. [...] When she was about 10 feet in, the string caught up and she looked over her {{shoulder}} as much as to say `what's holding us up there?' [...] The string loosened from the snag and she came on again. [...] By now the dust was rising from the shuffle of her paws as she crawled through the dirt and mold and I <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>see</b> her. [...] I called and pleaded, not knowing for certain whether she was coming or not. [...] At last, about 20 feet away, I saw two little amber eyes and heard a faint whimpering sound [...] [...] [...] at 15 feet away, she broke into a run. [...] We were so happy at Smoky's success that we patted and praised her for a full five minutes.” ...|$|E
2500|$|With his {{ownership}} reinstated, McMahon {{shifted his}} sights to, then babyface, Test, who was kayfabe dating Shane's sister, Stephanie. Shane disapproved of the relationship, feeling Stephanie was dating [...] "beneath the family's standards", {{and wound up}} feuding with Test. With help from the Mean Street Posse, McMahon made Test's life a living hell. At SummerSlam, McMahon met Test in a [...] "Love Her or Leave Her" [...] match, with the stipulation being that if McMahon won the match, Test and Stephanie <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>see</b> each other, and if he lost, McMahon would give his blessings to the pair. Test {{was able to get}} the win, and McMahon eventually settled his differences with Test, thus making his second face run by becoming his ally. As his father, Vince, then feuded with Triple H, Shane was attacked in early December 1999 by Triple H and D-Generation X (DX). He was thrown off the stage in a gang style attack, in which Billy Gunn and Road Dogg prevented members of the Corporation from saving Shane. Later in the year, Stephanie turned heel, siding with her new kayfabe husband then-heel, Triple H (the two began their off-screen relationship around this time, but did not marry in real life until 2003). With that, the McMahon-Helmsley Faction began, {{and all of the other}} McMahons disappeared from television.|$|E
60|$|During {{the hour}} which {{followed}} Walter's capture {{the two men}} remained close at hand, while their horses were allowed to stroll along the path, eating grass, and at the expiration of that time the animals <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> either be <b>seen</b> or heard.|$|R
60|$|When {{the boat}} <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be <b>seen</b> the child began to cry, {{and though the}} Witch tried to quiet it she could not manage it; so she went below to where the King was {{sleeping}} with the child on her arm, and awakened him, scolding him for leaving them alone on deck, while he and all the crew were asleep. It was great carelessness of him, she said, to leave no one to watch the ship with her.|$|R
60|$|When {{the guests}} were going, Stephen {{stood with her}} father on the steps to see them off. When the {{carriage}} had swept behind the farthest point in the long avenue, and when Harold's cap waving from the window <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be <b>seen,</b> Squire Norman turned to go in, but paused in obedience to the unconscious restraint of Stephen's hand. He waited patiently till with a long sigh {{she turned to him}} and they went in together.|$|R

2500|$|It {{has been}} said that the United States–Cuban thaw was spurred by Cuba's main {{international}} partner, Venezuela, experiencing sharp economic decline.

6000|$|The pirates {{were led}} by a man whose white dress showed up clearly in the darkness, and who Van Houten was sure was the [...] "Sea Tiger" [...] himself. They {{advanced}} towards the house in an irregular line, the two flanks rather in advance. No sound was heard among them. It was evident {{that they had been}} ordered to preserve silence until the house was surrounded. They went on and on until they <b>could</b> be <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>seen</b> by the watchers. Suddenly a voice shouted [...] "Fire!" ...|$|R
60|$|James laid by {{his rifle}} and again took his paddle, and, as all were rowing {{at the top}} of their speed, they {{gradually}} increased the distance between themselves and their pursuers. Rapidly the gap of water widened, and when darkness fell on the lake, the fugitives were more than half a mile ahead of their pursuers. The night was dark, and a light mist rising from the water further aided them. When night had set in, the pursuing canoes <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be <b>seen.</b>|$|R

50|$|The 18 m high, three-stage tower, {{which is}} also known as the Banwell Monument or Banwell Pepperpot, was built in 1840 from local lias stone with some {{decoration}} in Bath stone. During World War II, it was used as a lookout tower by the Home Guard. By the 1960s it was in a poor state of repair and <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be <b>seen</b> above the growing treetops. Local conservation groups undertook conservation work, and it was reopened to the public in 1996. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{argues that}} {{scholars}} have invariably misrepresented Spenser's religious views by concentrating only on his doctrinal and confessional allegiances. Spenser's religion {{needs to be}} seen as a response to the Reformation and the realization that marriage was now the institution in which everyone had to live. Using the work of John Calvin in particular, the essay argues that the first edition of The Faerie Queene charts the transformation of religious values after the Reformation, showing that Holiness <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be <b>seen</b> as a virtue isolated from all others, a realization that, as the poem demonstrates, had far-reaching consequence...|$|R
