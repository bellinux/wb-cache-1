40|$|International audienceSeveral {{compositions}} {{of metal}} <b>cored</b> <b>filler</b> <b>wire</b> were manufactured {{to define the}} best welding conditions for homogeneous welding, by Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) process, of a modified AISI 444 ferritic stainless steel dedicated to automotive exhaust manifold applications. The patented grade is know under APERAM trade name K 44 X and has been developed to present improved high temperature fatigue properties. All filler wires investigated contained 19 %Cr and 1. 8 %Mo, equivalent to the base metal K 44 X chemistry, but various titanium and niobium contents. Chemical analyses and microstructural observations of fusion zones revealed the need of a minimum Ti content of 0. 15 % to obtain a completely equiaxed grain structure. This structure conferred on the fusion zone a good ductility even in the as-welded state at room temperature. Unfortunately, titanium additions decreased the oxidation resistance at 950 °C if no significant Nb complementary alloying was made. The combined high Ti and Nb additions {{made it possible to}} obtain for the welded structure, after optimized heat treatment, high temperature tensile strengths and ductility for the fusion zones and assemblies, rather close to those of the base metal. 950 °C aging heat treatment was necessary to restore significantly the ductility of the as welded structure. Both fusion zone and base metal presented rather homogenized properties. Finally, with the optimized composition of the <b>cored</b> <b>filler</b> <b>wire</b> - 0. 3 Ti minimum (i. e. 0. 15 % in the fusion zone) and high Nb complementary additions, the properties, including the thermal fatigue strength, of the K 44 X assemblies are excellent...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{experimental study}} was undertaken {{to examine the}} suitability of pulsed current {{gas metal arc welding}} of 12 mm thick P 91 steels in groove joint configurations with metal <b>cored</b> <b>filler</b> <b>wire.</b> Both the single and multipass welds showed satisfactory bead morphology, tensile strength and toughness especially at higher groove angles of 60 and 750 for the selected range of welding current and speeds. The weld metal compositions showed considerably high presence of Ni, Mn and Si with little loss of other alloying elements. The weld properties were primarily affected by the heat input per unit length of weld and the groove angle. The maximum ultimate tensile strength and toughness of the welds were found to be around 845 MPa and 125 J, respectively, for a heat input of 1. 38 kJ/mm and a groove angle of 75 degrees. The use of metal cored filler wires could enhance the welding speed by 20 % and filler wire deposition rate by 42 % compared to that with the solid wires. Overall, the present study showed that the pulsed current gas metal arc welding of medium to high thickness P 91 steels using metal cored filler wires could provide higher deposition rate and welding speed, and enhanced weld bead properties in comparison to solid wires.

40|$|International audienceSeven {{compositions}} {{of metal}} <b>cored</b> <b>filler</b> <b>wires</b> for Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), containing {{the same weight}} percent of chromium (Cr) and molybdenum (Mo) as 444 steel, but with different titanium (Ti) and niobium (Nb) contents were investigated. Experimental results {{pointed out that the}} <b>filler</b> <b>wire</b> Ti content required to be twice time more than the amount expected in the deposited metal. This was due to the low Ti transfer ratio during arc welding. Moreover, Ti increased the wetting angle and promoted penetration. It was supposed that Ti affected the weld pool surface tension what led to inward Marangoni convection. Columnar to equiaxed grain transiton (CET) was also promoted thanks to the precipitation in the weld pool of Ti rich refractory compounds which act as heterogeneous nucleation sites for equiaxed grains. A minimum 0. 3 % Ti was required in the <b>filler</b> <b>wire</b> to form a completely equiaxed grain structure in the fusion zone. Niobium in the <b>filler</b> <b>wire</b> did not seem to have any effect on penetration, wetting and grain structure of the fusion zone...|$|R
40|$|Wear and {{corrosion}} are severe {{problems in}} gas and diesel engine components {{and to prevent}} these problems, number of solutions are available. In this thesis one of the possible solutions, cladding of engine components is studied with a state-of-the-art welding process, Cold Metal Transfer. CMT is a rather new and cost-effective method of welding and cladding with a limited heat input and a large variety of available materials. During this thesis, {{a great number of}} cladding tests with different cobalt-base alloy filler materials on different metallic base materials were run. These tests aimed to optimize the cladding parameters for a <b>cored</b> Co-alloy <b>filler</b> <b>wire.</b> Another region of interest was to optimize the tribological properties of the coatings in order to reduce friction coefficient and increase the wear resistance of the components. In this thesis, a powder feeder was used to spray particles into the melt pool during cladding. It was discovered that CMT is able to restrain problems traditional overlay welding pro-cesses exhibit: high heat input resulting in unwanted changes of the base material, which also leads to high dilution and large amount of spattering during the process. The to-and-fro movement of the <b>filler</b> <b>wire</b> reduces the heat input and the precise process control with mechanical droplet detachment reduces the amount of spattering greatly. The CMT-process optimization was successful for Co-base <b>filler</b> <b>wire,</b> and optimal param-eters were achieved by cladding tests and analyzation of the results. The optimization resulted in low-diluted (< 5 %) Stellite-coating (450 - 500 HV 1) with a proper fusion bond and a narrow Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{laser beam}} welding of copper its {{material}} properties require high intensities of the laser beam for a stable process, which are often realized by small focal diameters.

40|$|AbstractAlthough laser brazing is well established, the {{energy-related}} {{efficiency of}} this joining method is quite low. That {{is because of}} low absorptivity of solid-state laser radiation, especially when copper base braze metals are used. Conventionally the laser beam is set close to the vertical axis and the <b>filler</b> <b>wire</b> is delivered under a flat angle. Therefore, {{the most of the}} utilized laser power is reflected and thus left unexploited. To address this situation an alternative processing concept for laser brazing, where the laser beam is leading the <b>filler</b> <b>wire,</b> has been investigated intending to make use of reflected shares of the laser radiation. Process monitoring shows, that the reflection of the laser beam can be used purposefully to preheat the substrate which is supporting the wetting and furthermore increasing the efficiency of the process. Experiments address a standard application from the automotive industry joining zinc coated steels using CuSi 3 Mn 1 <b>filler</b> <b>wire.</b> Feasibility of the alternative processing concept is demonstrated, showing that higher processing speeds can be attained, reducing the required energy per unit length while maintaining joint properties...|$|R

Six test plates were joined by two types of <b>filler</b> <b>wire</b> with similar chemical composition to the base metal, and with lower carbon content and slightly higher alloy elements content compared to the first one. Test plates then exerted three different pre-heat and post-heat treatments on both groups. The three types of heat treatments were alternatively without pre-heat and post-heat, with pre-heat only, and finally with pre-heat and post-heat.
