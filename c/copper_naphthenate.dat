40|$|Abstract: In recent years, the {{performance}} of <b>copper</b> <b>naphthenate</b> as a wood preservative has been in question. To understand the varying results of <b>copper</b> <b>naphthenate</b> in preventing wood decay, {{a closer look at}} eight naphthenic acid (NA) supplies was undertaken. Initial studies of NA samples from individual suppliers revealed large differences in chemical composition and wood preservation ability. Samples were rated from best to worst determined by percent weight loss due to fungal activity. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed that one of the intermediate quality wood preservatives from our wood decay studies contains a large portion of phenolic and aliphatic impurities in addition to the naphthenic acid components. To determine the effect of the impurities on the efficacy studies, we developed a method using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) to remove them from the sample without changing the characteristics of the naphthenic acid composition. Comparison of NA SFE extracts continues.

30|$|Three {{types of}} {{catalysts}} were purchased commercially from the Chengdu Kelong Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Sichuan province, China) and {{were used as}} received with the American Chemical Society (ACS) grade. The oil-soluble catalysts are <b>copper</b> <b>naphthenate</b> (Cu(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2) and manganese naphthenate (Mn(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2). The organic ligand is naphthenic acid (C 22 H 14 O 4) which serves as the carrier of metal ions to reduce the viscosity of heavy oil and is also crucial to the catalytic performance, and the transition metal ions that serve as catalytic centers are, respectively, Cu 2 + and Mn 2 +. The dispersed catalyst is copper oxide (CuO), and the water-soluble catalyst is copper dichloride (CuCl 2). The fine quartz used in the experiment {{was obtained from the}} Pixian Zhitai Chemical (Sichuan province, China) with 60 â€“ 80 mesh size.

3000|$|The {{low-temperature}} {{catalytic oxidation}} of {{heavy crude oil}} (Xinjiang Oilfield, China) was studied using three types of catalysts including oil-soluble, water-soluble, and dispersed catalysts. According to primary screening, oil-soluble catalysts, <b>copper</b> <b>naphthenate</b> and manganese naphthenate, are more attractive, and were selected to further investigate their catalytic performance in in situ upgrading of heavy oil. The heavy oil compositions and molecular structures were characterized by column chromatography, elemental analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry before and after reaction. An Arrhenius kinetics model was introduced to calculate the rheological activation energy of heavy oil from the viscosityâ€“temperature characteristics. Results show that the two oil-soluble catalysts can crack part of heavy components into light components, decrease the heteroatom content, and achieve the transition of reaction mode from oxygen addition to bond scission. The calculated rheological activation energy of heavy oil from the fitted Arrhenius model is consistent with physical properties of heavy oil (oil viscosity and contents of heavy fractions). It is found that the temperature, oil composition, and internal molecular structures are the main factors affecting its flow ability. Oil-soluble catalyst-assisted air injection or air huff-n-puff injection is a promising in situ catalytic upgrading method for improving heavy oil recovery.|$|E

40|$|The Cooperative {{continues}} to actively address a {{diverse array of}} {{issues related to the}} effective use of wood utility poles. The trials {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} MITC-Fume are now in their seventh year and continue to show that methylisothiocyanate (MITC) levels in MITC-Fume treatments remain higher than comparable metham sodium treatments. The levels of chemical are, however, declining, suggesting that this treatment may need replenishment in 3 to 5 years. Trials with the solid wood fumigant Basamid continue to show that MITC release can be enhanced by addition of small amounts of copper. Field trials suggest that these additives become less important with time. As a result, unamended Basamid may be suitable for treatment where the risk of immediate decay is not high, but the utility wishes to protect against future attack. Field trials with various water-diffusible internal treatments continue to show that these treatments move more slowly through Douglas-fir heartwood than do fumigants. Boron levels in pole sections treated with fused borate rods remain at levels that will protect against fungal attack 6 years after treatment. Similar trials with a boron/ fluoride rod indicate that neither fluoride or boron levels in the poles are adequate for wood protection 2 years after treatment. While the dosages tested were relatively low, the volumes of chemical were similar to the liquid volumes normally applied during internal remedial treatment. We will sample these poles next year to ensure that our measurements accurately reflect the chemical levels present. Trials to evaluate the effects of glycol on boron movement from fused borate rods suggest that glycol enhanced boron diffusion to only a slight extent. This effect was most pronounced at lower moisture contents. This trial was established to identify methods for improving boron movement in drier wood. In addition, moisture measurements in these poles suggest the internal wood moisture content varies widely both seasonally and positionally. While elevated moisture levels can negatively affect the movement of gaseous fumigants, excess moisture is critical for diffusion of boron or fluoride and its absence around the treatment site can markedly reduce the efficacy of rod treatments. These poles will continue to be monitored to assess both boron movement and seasonal changes in moisture content. Trials to identify safe, effective and easily used systems for protecting wood exposed during field fabrication are continuing. Boron and fluoride continue to provide excellent protection to field drilled bolt holes. These treatments are safe and easy to apply, and have provided protection in our field test for 14 years. Trials of similar formulations on simulated decking are also reported to provide additional information on the ability of boron and fluoride to protect exposed Douglas-fir heartwood. Efforts to improve the effectiveness of through boring as a method for enhancing the treatment of Douglas-fir poles are continuing. This past year, we evaluated preservative distribution around through bored holes as a means of developing optimum through boring patterns that maximized treatment while minimizing potential strength effects. These trials suggest the diamond shaped through boring zone of effect is relatively narrow. This information will be used in the coming year to construct optimum patterns for poles of various classes. The goal of this project is to develop a standard through boring pattern that would permit automation of the process. This would create the potential for cost savings on new poles. Trials to evaluate the durability of western redcedar are nearly complete. These trials were initiated because of concerns that second growth western redcedar might be less durable than poles cut from older trees. As expected, cedar varied widely in its resistance to fungal attack. This resistance, however, was not related to tree age, suggesting that there might not be a difference between so-called "old-growth" and "second growth" material. These data will be more thoroughly analyzed once the final set of trials are completed. In addition, we are evaluating more rapid methods for assessing cedar durability by measuring tropolone content. Tropolones are an important component of the extractives that make cedar heartwood so durable. Field trials of various externally applied supplemental groundline treatments are continuing at sites in Oregon, California, and New York. Trials in Corvallis, Oregon, have shown that various <b>copper</b> <b>naphthenate,</b> fluoride or boron based systems are at least as effective as the pentachlorophenol (penta) based systems that were formerly used for this purpose. Penta concentrations in one system have now declined below a protective level, while the copper based systems continue to remain at a protective level. Field trials in California are following similar trends and indicate that the alternative systems will provide comparable performance. Fungus cellar trials of <b>copper</b> <b>naphthenate</b> treated western redcedar stakes continue to show that this chemical provides excellent protection to cedar sapwood. Weathered wood that was treated with <b>copper</b> <b>naphthenate</b> {{continues to}} perform more poorly than freshly sawn wood treated to similar retention levels. Variations in permeability likely account for these differences. A new Wood Pole Maintenance Manual has been completed and is now ready for distribution.

40|$|In a study {{replicated}} {{across two}} states and two years, {{we tested the}} sublethal effects on honey bees of the miticides Apistan (tau fluvalinate) and Check Mite+ (coumaphos) and the wood preservative <b>copper</b> <b>naphthenate</b> applied at label rates in field conditions. A continuous covariate, a colony Varroa mite index, helped us disambiguate {{the effects of the}} chemicals on bees while adjusting for a presumed benefit of controlling mites. Mite levels in colonies treated with Apistan or Check Mite+ were not different from levels in non-treated controls. Experimental chemicals significantly decreased 3 -day brood survivorship and increased construction of queen supercedure cells compared to non-treated controls. Bees exposed to Check Mite+ as immatures had higher legacy mortality as adults relative to non-treated controls, whereas bees exposed to Apistan had improved legacy mortality relative to non-treated controls. Relative to non-treated controls, Check Mite+ increased adult emergence weight. Although there was a treatment effect on a test of associative learning, {{it was not possible to}} statistically separate the treatment means, but bees treated with Apistan performed comparatively well. And finally, there were no detected effects of bee hive chemical on colony bee population, amount of brood, amount of honey, foraging rate, time required for marked released bees to return to their nest, percentage of released bees that return to the nest, and colony Nosema spore loads. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine sublethal effects of bee hive chemicals applied at label rates under field conditions while disambiguating the results from mite control benefits realized from the chemicals. Given the poor performance of the miticides at reducing mites and their inconsistent effects on the host, these results defend the use of bee health management practices that minimize use of exotic hive chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Over-the-counter (OTC) wood {{preservatives}} can provide wood {{with both a}} moisture barrier and fungicidal protection against biodeterioration, yet there is little comparative data {{on the performance of}} these preservatives. In this study, the potential of various low-toxicity, OTC preservatives was evaluated on five western wood species, western redcedar (Thuja plicata), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), Douglas-fir (Pseudosuga menziesii),lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens). The active ingredients tested were copper- 8 -quinolinolate, <b>copper</b> <b>naphthenate,</b> zinc naphthenate, 3 -Iodo 2 -propynylbutlycarbamate (IPBC), Bis (tri-n-butyltin) oxide (TBTO), TBTO, TBTO, and TBTO trichloromethylthio-phthalimide (Folpet). Small blocks and stakes of each species were dipped for 3 minutes in one of twelve OTC preservatives to simulate homeowner application. To examine the efficacy of these preservatives, treated blocks were subjected to a modified American Society of Testing and Materials Standards (ASTM) D 2017 - 81 soil-block test to evaluate above ground decay resistance as measured by wood weight loss following exposure to Postia placenta (Fr.) Cooke or Trametes versicolor (L:Fr.) Pilat, a brown and white rot fungus, respectively. Test stakes were placed in soil-beds maintained in an environmentally controlled greenhouse. The stakes were evaluated for the degree of decay at 3 month intervals for the first year, followed by 18 and 24 month ratings. Preservative treatments improved performance of most species except lodgepole pine; improvements were most noticeable in soil-bed trials with redwood and western redcedar. The results suggest that topical application of commercially available preservatives has merit for enhancing the performance of naturally durable woods in soil contact, but their value for less durable woods is questionable. Wood used above-ground will benefit most from such topical treatments, however, for best performance a yearly reapplication might be necessary for the less durable wood species...|$|E
30|$|Textiles {{act as the}} {{carriers}} for microorganisms, such as pathogenic and odour generating bacteria, mould and fungi causing damage to clothing, strength loss, staining, discoloration and may even cause skin diseases. Antimicrobial finishes maintain hygiene and enables to avoid infection from pathogens especially in hospitals, nursing homes, schools, hotels, and crowded public areas. They prevent unpleasant odour on intimate apparel, underwear, socks and athletic wear. Microbes attack natural fibres because they are hydrophilic in nature. In cotton under certain conditions the presence of carbohydrates acts as nutrients and energy source to microbes. Various other sources of nutrients for microorganisms are soil, dust, solutes from sweat and some textile finishes (Gao and Cranston 2008; Schindler and Hauser 2004; Srivastava 2011). Antimicrobial agents are of two types: leaching and non-leaching. Leaching types work through controlled release mechanism by leaching on the fabric surface or at {{the interior of the}} fibre. These are effective against microbes on the fibre surface or in the surrounding environment and include triclosan (2, 4, 4 â€²-trichloro- 2 â€²-hydroxydiphenyl ether), <b>copper</b> <b>naphthenate,</b> quaternary ammonium salts, benzimidazol derivatives etc. Non-leaching types bind to the fibre surfaces and control those microbes that come in contact with the fibre surface only. This type includes chitosan, octadecyl aminodimethyl trimethoxy silylpropyl ammonium chloride, poly-hexamethyl biguanide etc. Antimicrobial finishes can be applied on textile substrates by exhaust, pad-dry-cure, coating, spray methods or in spinning dope (Dorugade and Bhagyashri 2010; Elshafei and El-Zanfaly 2011; Mao 2002; RistiÄ‡ et al. 2011; Shrivastava et al. 2011; Technical Bulletin 2004). Antimicrobial agents control the growth of microbes by various mechanisms ranging from preventing cell reproduction, blocking of enzymes, reaction with the cell membrane to the destruction of the cell walls and poisoning the cell from within (Schindler and Hauser 2004). Various requirements of these finishes in textiles are durability to washing, dry cleaning and hot pressing, no harmful effects to the user and the environment, compliance with the statutory requirements of regulating agencies, compatible with the chemical processes and easy application without deteriorating fabric quality (Schindler and Hauser 2004; Thiry 2010).|$|E
40|$|Previously {{established}} {{field trials}} of MTTC-Fume continue {{to show that}} this chemical remains in Douglas-fir and southern pine poles at fungitoxic levels 5 years after treatment. In general, increasing dosages resulted in higher chemical levels in the poles. All of the MITC-Fume treatments resulted in higher residual M 1 TC levels than comparable metham sodium treatments. Field trials with solid basaniid with and without copper sulfate continue to show the promise of this chemical. Basamid treated poles continue to contain MITC at levels which exceed those for comparable metham sodium treatments. These results, which are currently being confirmed in poles in service, indicate that this formulation can deliver fiingitoxic MITC levels to wood in service, without the risk of spills associated with metham sodium. We have completed trials with gelled and pelletized metham sodium formulations. Both of these formulations offered improved safety during application. Initial laboratory trials also suggested that the gelled formulation was more effective than comparable liquid metham sodium. Field trials, however, indicate that the formulations provided protection comparable to the liquid formulation in poles over the test period. The gelled formulation still offers the advantage of reduced risks of spills during application. Trials are also continuing with various solid, water diffusible treatments for arresting internal decay. Trials of fused borate rods continue to show that these treatments require more moisture for effective movement in Douglas-fir poles. Field trials have also been established with borate rods with glycol as an additive to determine if glycols can accelerate diffusion in drier wood. The poles in these trials have also been sensored to monitor internal moisture changes over {{time in order to}} better correlate boron diffusion with wood moisture content. Trials underway with a boronlfluoride rod indicate that the boron is diffusing well from these rods, while the fluoride is moving somewhat slower. Neither chemical has approached a fiungal threshold one year after treatment, but the combination of chemicals may lead to more effective fungal control. Trials with pelletized metham sodium/basamid mixtures suggests that using ratios of these two chemicals can produce an initial rapid burst ofMITC release followed by a slower MITC release with time. This combination allows for rapid control of existing fungal infestations followed by long term protection against reinvasion. These laboratory trials will be further confirmed with field trials. The trials to evaluate the effects of voids on fumigant movement initially suggested that voids have little influence on subsequent fumigant levels {{on either side of the}} void. Sampling 8 years after treatment, however, indicates that chioropicrin levels were generally higher in poles without voids. We plan further trials of actual field poles containing voids to confirm these effects. Trials to identify treatments for protecting the sapwood of western redcedar poles as well as wood exposed in field drilled bolt holes are continuing. Trials in western redcedar sapwood have identified a number of chemicals which can be remedially applied to protect this wood against fungal attack. At present, however, commercial pole spraying has largely ceased making further field trials difficult. Field trials to identify treatments for protecting untreated wood exposed during drilling for various pole attachments continue to show that diffusible boron and fluoride compounds provide excellent long term protection against flingal attack. The protective effects of one diffusible treatment, Boracol, however, has begun to decline. Further sampling will be undertaken to identify the long term effectiveness of the remaining treatments. Trials to identify enhanced patterns for through boring of Douglas-fir poles are complete. The results indicate that patterns as widely spaced as 400 mm apart longitudinally still produce a nearly completely treated pole i n the through bored zone. Pentachlorophenol levels in the through bored zone were generally above the threshold for ftrngal growth. Prior sampling of Douglas-fir poles in service suggest that even poles with small skips in the through bored zone contained no evidence of internal decay. These results suggest that the through boring pattern can be extended without adversely risking pole service life. A reduced through boring pattern would decrease treatment costs while minimizing impacts on pole strength. Trials to evaluate the application of boron to freshly peeled Douglas-fir poles as a means of preventing fungal colonization using a thermal process suggest that thermal treatment failed to produce a boron loading sufilcient to permit subsequent diffusion across the pole section after a 3 month diffusion period. Evaluations of various external groundline preservative formulations continue to indicate that replacement formulations based upon <b>copper</b> <b>naphthenate,</b> boron or fluoride perform comparably to earlier formulations employing pentachlorophenol and creosote. Pentachlorophenol levels in some treatments have fallen below the threshold for fungal growth, while those in all of the replacement treatments remain above a U protective level. These results suggest that the newer groundline preservative systems should provide a reasonable level of protection against external decay. Laboratory trials to better understand the levels of combinations of chemicals required for protection in the groundline zone are continuing. Fungal cellar evaluations of <b>copper</b> <b>naphthenate</b> treated western redcedar continue to show excellent performance at levels specified in the American Wood Preservers' Association Standards. Performance is generally better for wood which was freshly sawn prior to treatment, while wood cuts from weathered poles in service has provided slightly lower levels of protection. The weather wood apparently has higher permeability, making it more likely to lose chemical in soil contact. Further evaluations are planned...|$|E
40|$|At {{the present}} time, plywood has lost market share to {{competitors}} such as waferboard and {{oriented strand board}} (OSB). Improvement in plywood production and plywood performance is required to make plywood competitive with other wood based panel products. The objectives of this study are: (1) to examine {{the possibility of using}} microwave for drying rotary cut veneer, (2) to investigate treatment methods for veneer both before and after fabrication of panels using diphenyl-methane diisocyanate (MDI), (3) to test the characteristics of veneer and panels visually and mechanically. The experimental (preliminary and main research topics) approach to addressing this question involves investigating the characteristics of high performance panel products. All experimental designs used in this study are factorial ANOVA models for different factorial levels. A one factorial design was used to analyse the effect of moisture content (0 % and 10 %) on the % solid MDI uptake of veneer samples, and the effect of % MDI concentrations (100 %, 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, and 20 %) on the % solid MDI uptake of small cube wood samples. A two factorial design was used to investigate uptake of MDI in veneer and plywood treatments. The variables tested included three concentrations of MDI (50 %, 60 % and 70 %) and three levels of soaking times (5. 10, and 15 minutes). Another two factorial design was used to analyse the effects of five levels of % MDI concentrations (100 %, 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, and 20 %) and three levels of temperature setting (60, 100, and 140 C) on the curing time of MDI solution for small cube wood samples. Analysis of the effects of edge sealing (sealed and unsealed) and pressure type (low and high pressure) on the uptake MDI and <b>Copper</b> <b>Naphthenate</b> was analysed using a two factorial design. The study shows that microwave drying of veneer is technically feasible to cope with veneer drying problems, which at the present time poses a "bottleneck" and is the major consumer of thermal energy used in plywood production. Microwave drying is characterised by having low within charge variability in moisture content after drying; no drying defects and has no effect on the glueability of plywood. However, some importance aspects of the use of microwaves should be taken into account- in designing a commercial drying process. These include: the position, condition, type of wave guide covers and the power level of microwave. Microwave power had a significant effect on drying time. The higher the microwave power used the shorter the drying time. The highest uptake of solid MDI in plywood samples was obtained with 70 MDI following 10 minutes soaking (51 kg/m 3). This was followed by 60 MDI (45 kg/m 3) after 15 minutes soaking and 50 % MDI after 15 minutes soaking (41 kg/m 3) respectively. The highest solid MDI uptake in radiata pine veneer was obtained with 70 % MDI following 10 minutes soaking (115 kg/m 3). This was followed by 60 % MDI (94 kg/m 3) after 15 minutes soaking and 50 % MDI after 15 minutes soaking (71 kg/m 3) respectively. Investigation into the curing processes indicated that the best temperature for curing MDI solution was 60 C. Microwave energy could not be applied for curing MDI treated samples. Microwaving resulted in substantial losses of MDI solution from the wood blocks. Pressure impregnation of MDI, increased the uptake of resin compared to soaking techniques. The highest uptake of solid MDI for plywood samples was obtained with 70 % MDI in unsealed samples using high pressure treatment (359 kg/m 3). This was followed by the treatment of plywood which had been edge sealed and high pressure treated (208 kg/m 3), sealed and low pressure treatment (71 kg/m 3) and unsealed and low pressure treatment (51 kg/m 3), respectively. The highest uptake of <b>Copper</b> <b>Naphthenate</b> in plywood samples was obtained for edge-sealed and high pressure treatment (0. 92 % wt/wt Cu) followed by unsealed and high pressure treatment (0. 88 % wt/wt Cu), unsealed and low pressure treatment (0. 45 % wt/wt Cu) and unsealed and low pressure treatment (0. 51 % wt/wt Cu), respectively. MDI solution applied to plywood and veneers by immersion improved the surface qualities of these products. The surfaces were smoother, more rigid; there was water resistance compared to untreated samples. Water absorption was limited to 8 kg/m 3 after 5 minutes exposure compared to 84 kg/m 3 for untreated plywood. The average surface hardness of MDI treated veneers (82) was 4 points (in Shore C scale) higher than untreated veneers (78). The greatest hardness was obtained for samples treated with 50 % MDI solution (85), followed by 60 % (83) and 70 % (78) MDI solutions. The average surface hardness of MDI treated plywood using soaking treatment (85) was 6 points higher than untreated plywood (79). When MDI was applied by pressure impregnation surface hardness scores of 90 were obtained. The average shear strength of MDI treated veneer (0. 183 kN) is 35 % higher than untreated veneers (0. 135 kN). The highest values were obtained for samples treated with 50 % MDI solution (0. 202 kN), followed by 70 % (0. 178 kN) and 60 % (0. 169 kN) MDI solutions. The average shear strength of MDI treated plywood using soaking treatment was 0. 125 kN. This was 24 % higher than untreated plywood (0. 101 kN). This shear strength value is 19 % higher when compared to that for Cu Naphthenate treated plywood using pressure treatment (0. 105 kN). It can be concluded that MDI resin can be used to improved the water resistance, surface hardness and strength properties of veneer and plywood. Cu naphthenate (in kerosene) preservative can also be used for treating finished plywood without affecting the strength properties of treated plywood.

40|$|Evaluation of {{previously}} established field trials of remedial internal treatments demonstrates the continued performance of chioropicrin, Vorlex, and methylisothiocyanate (MITC). While {{the degree of}} protection afforded by these treatments has declined with time, residual fungitoxic levels remain in many tests. Field trials of gelatin encapsulated MITC indicate that gelatin had no negative effect on fumigant performance even when no water was added {{at the time of}} treatment. Closed tube bioassays, chemical analyses, and culturing of Douglas-fir and southern pine poles treated with glass encapsulated METC (MITC-Fume) indicate that this chemical is outperforming metham sodium 3 years after application. While the glass vials lost chemical very slowly, the slow release rate did not appear to adversely affect MITC performance. Trials to evaluate the performance of fused borate rods were sampled after 1 or 2 years of exposure. Chemical analysis of cores removed from the test poles revealed that none of the treatments contained boron at levels which would be considered adequate for arresting or preventing colonization by wood decay fungi. Interestingly, boron levels in poles exposed in Hilo, Hawaii were highest above the treatment hole, suggesting that some upward diffusion of this chemical is possible. The low boron levels in these poles are reason for concern, since a number of utilities are considering the using this formulation for remedial treatment at the groundline. Evaluations of new solid fumigants are progressing. Trials with Basamid indicate that the addition of copper compounds improved the rate of decomposition to produce MITC. Simultaneous addition of copper sulfate and Basamid may be useful for accelerating the decomposition of this compound, making it practical for control of internal decay fungi. Trials have been established to evaluate the performance of gelled and pelletized metham sodium and a sodium fluoride/boron rod. These trials will be evaluated in future reports. A third field trial to evaluate the performance of a copper naphthenate/boron paste for internal treatment of Douglas-fir poles is currently be evaluated to determine chemical levels 3 years after treatment. The performance of gelled metham sodium was further evaluated under laboratory conditions to better understand the performance of this chemical. Gelled metham sodium provided improved fungal control in comparison with liquid metham sodium and appeared to produce increased MITC levels under a variety of test conditions. The improved performance of this formulation may reflect the ability of the gell to retain moisture {{for longer periods of time}} than the liquid metham sodium formulation. Further studies of this formulation are underway. Laboratory studies were also performed to evaluate the effects of various additives on the performance of Basamid. Once again, the addition of copper compounds enhanced the production of MITC. A number of other compounds shifted decomposition to the production of carbon disulfide and carbonyl sulfide, two less fungitoxic compounds. Further studies are underway to identify non-sulfur products which may provide some protection against wood decay fungi. Evaluations of the effects of artificial voids on performance of fumigants in Douglas-fir poles indicate that voids had little or no effect on fumigant distribution. As a result, fumigant treatment of solid wood around voids represents a viable strategy for improving pole service life. Evaluation of timbers treated with metham sodium indicate that detectable levels of MITC were present one year after treatment. These timbers will be evaluated in subsequent years to determine the protective period provided by fumigants in sawn material. We continue development of a fumigant movement model using data previously developed on MITC. This year, we evaluated a previously developed system, ANSYS. Results of preliminary trials are similar to data previously developed on MITC-Fume treated poles and indicate that modeling MITC movement should be possible. Further trials are underway to confirm and expand this model. The effect of wood moisture content, temperature and wood species on metham sodium decomposition was investigated under laboratory conditions. The efficiency of dcomposition to MITC varied widely, but was most affected by temperature and wood moisture content. The results suggests that there is considerable potential for improving decomposition efficiency to enhance performance of this fumigant. Further studies to characterize the relationship between chemical content of the wood species and decomposition are underway. Field trials to identify safer treatments for preventing decay of cedar sapwood and protecting field drilled bolt holes are continuing. Diffusible treatments continue to provide excellent protection for field drilled bolt holes. A study to develop estimates of the extent of decay above the groundline in Douglas-fir poles in the Pacific Northwest is underway. The data from this study will be used to develop estimates of the potential for damage and provide some insight into the extent of this problem. Studies to develop guidelines for sterilization of Douglas-fir poles following air-seasoning are continuing. Evaluations of internal temperature development during kiln-drying were completed this year and indicate that internal temperatures during typical pole drying schedules were more than adequate for acheiving sterilization. Further evaluations of the data are underway to develop reliable heating curves for this process. Evaluations of groundline preservative systems have been established at Corvallis, OR and Merced, CA. The results indicate that all of the formulations are moving well through the wood in a manner similar to that found with pentachlorophenol-based systems. Chemical levels in some treatments; however, are beginning to decline 30 months after treatment. Studies are now underway to establish thresholds for combinations of the various formulations. <b>Copper</b> <b>naphthenate</b> treated western redcedar stakelets continue to perform well in fungus cellar trials. Stakes weathered prior to treatment are degrading slightly faster, while freshly sawn stakelets continue to perform well. Field trials have also been established to evaluate the performance of <b>copper</b> <b>naphthenate</b> treated Douglas-fir utility poles in California and Oregon. The chemical levels and fungal colonization will be monitored in these poles to provide a guide to performance of this chemical in western wood species...|$|E
