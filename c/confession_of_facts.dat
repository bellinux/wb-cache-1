However, as Tom observed the same night before going to bed, it was only in joke, and John had always been famous for being polite to ladies, even when he was quite a boy. Ruth said, 'Oh! indeed!' She didn't say anything else.|$|R

For little Ruth had now two pupils to attend, each three times a week; and each two hours at a time; and besides this, she had painted some screens and card-racks, and, unknown to Tom (was there ever anything so delightful!), had walked into a certain shop which dealt in such articles, after often peeping through the window; and had taken courage to ask the Mistress of that shop whether she would buy them. And the mistress had not only bought them, but had ordered more, and that very morning Ruth had made <b>confession</b> <b>of</b> these <b>facts</b> to Tom, and had handed him the money in a little purse she had worked expressly for the purpose. They had been in a flutter about this, and perhaps had shed a happy tear or two for anything the history knows to the contrary; but it was all over now; and a brighter face than Tom's, or a brighter face than Ruth's, the bright sun had not looked on since he went to bed last night.|$|R
6000|$|... § 7. Now, I {{have insisted}} long on this English character, because I want {{the reader to}} {{understand}} thoroughly the opposite element of the noble picturesque; its expression, namely, of suffering, of poverty, or decay, nobly endured by unpretending strength of heart. Nor only unpretending, but unconscious. If there be visible pensiveness in the building, as in a ruined abbey, it becomes, or claims to become, beautiful; but the picturesqueness is in the unconscious suffering,--the look that an old laborer has, not knowing that there is anything pathetic in his grey hair, and withered arms, and sunburnt breast; and thus there are the two extremes, the consciousness of pathos in the confessed ruin, {{which may or may}} not be beautiful, according to the kind of it; and the entire denial of all human calamity and care, in the swept proprieties and neatness of English modernism: and, between these, there is the unconscious <b>confession</b> <b>of</b> the <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> distress and decay, in by-words; the world's hard work being gone through all the while, and no pity asked for, nor contempt feared. And this is the expression of that Calais spire, and of all picturesque things, in so far as they have mental or human expression at all.|$|R

From sixteen to thirty-six cannot be called an age, yet it is a pretty long stretch {{of that sort of}} experience which teaches a man slowly to see and feel. It is for me a distinct period; and when I emerged from it into another air, as it were, and said to myself: [...] "Now I must speak of these things or remain unknown to the end of my days," [...] it was with the ineradicable hope, that accompanies one through solitude as well as through a crowd, of ultimately, some day, at some moment, making myself understood.|$|R

This research was qualitative research, in which content {{analysis was used to}} analyze speech act of complaint. The data of the research were in the forms of utterances as uttered by the characters in <b>Confessions</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholic found in dialogues. In the research, quantitative data were also used in the form of number to strengthen the findings. The main instrument of the research was the researcher herself and the secondary instrument was the data sheets. The data were collected by note-taking technique. In analyzing the data, the researcher used referential methods. The methods were done by identifying and re-examining the data based on the theory of complaint strategies and the theory of complaint functions proposed by Anna Trosborg. The validity of the research was gained by doing the theory of triangulation and doing peer correction with competent friends of English Language and Literature majoring in linguistics. The research reveals three findings. First, {{the ways of}} expressing complaint applied by <b>Confessions</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholic’s characters are direct and indirect types. In the application <b>of</b> the type, <b>Confessions</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholic’s characters mostly apply indirect complaints compared to direct complaint. Second, the four complaint functions applied by characters <b>of</b> <b>Confession</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholic are request to repair, threat, request for forbearance, and share negative evaluation. In the application <b>of</b> the maxims, <b>Confessions</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholic’s characters mostly apply request for repair, and they never use request for forbearance. Third, the complaint strategies applied by <b>Confessions</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholic’s characters are no explicit reproach, expressing of disapproval, accusation, and blame. Blame is applied mostly by <b>Confessions</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholic’s characters in their utterances. Key words: <b>Confessions</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholic, speech acts of complain...|$|R
