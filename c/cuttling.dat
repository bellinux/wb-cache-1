50|$|In 1810 <b>Cuttle</b> {{was under}} the command of Lieutenant Michael Molloy, off North America. In June 1811 she was under Lieutenant William L. Patterson, who in 1812 was with her in Portsmouth. On 24 July 1812 she {{captured}} the American vessel Laura. <b>Cuttle</b> was then under a Lieutenant Saunders. The Mary, which <b>Cuttle</b> had detained as she was sailing from Rio de Janeiro to New York, came into Bermuda on 15 August. In 1813 <b>Cuttle</b> was under Lieutenant John T. Young.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, Cap'en <b>Cuttle,</b> Cap'en Cuttle!' said Mrs MacStinger, {{making her}} chin rigid, and shaking it in unison with what, {{but for the}} {{weakness}} of her sex, {{might be described as}} her fist. 'Oh, Cap'en <b>Cuttle,</b> Cap'en <b>Cuttle,</b> do you dare to look me in the face, and not be struck down in the berth!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's an old {{habit of}} mine, Wal'r,' said the Captain, 'any time these fifty year. When you see Ned <b>Cuttle</b> bite his nails, Wal'r, {{then you may}} know that Ned <b>Cuttle's</b> aground.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Who says he don't live here?' {{retorted}} the implacable MacStinger. 'I said it wasn't Cap'en <b>Cuttle's</b> house--and it ain't his house--and forbid it, that it ever {{should be}} his house--for Cap'en <b>Cuttle</b> don't {{know how to}} keep a house--and don't deserve to have a house--it's my house--and when I let the upper floor to Cap'en <b>Cuttle,</b> oh I do a thankless thing, and cast pearls before swine!' ...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Cuttle</b> Cart (also {{known as}} the SuperDuperCharger during development) is an Atari 2600 {{cartridge}} developed by Chad Schell in the early 2000s. Compatible with the Starpath Supercharger under license, the <b>Cuttle</b> Cart allows ROM images to be loaded via an 1/8" [...] minijack audio interface such as a cassette tape or CD player. [...] Discontinued by the manufacturer in 2003, the cartridge is rare and released in limited number; only 204 <b>Cuttle</b> Carts were produced.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cuttle</b> was at {{the capture}} of Martinique in early 1809. [...] In 1847 the Admiralty {{authorized}} the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp [...] "Martinique" [...] to all remaining survivors of the campaign that claimed it. Jackson left <b>Cuttle</b> after Martinique.|$|R
6000|$|... 'To Captain <b>Cuttle's,</b> Miss?' {{interposed}} Rob; 'no, he's {{not gone}} there, Miss. Because he left particular word that if Captain <b>Cuttle</b> called, I should {{tell him how}} surprised he was, not to have seen him yesterday, and should make him stop till he came back.' ...|$|R
60|$|No, no; when Jean Myles {{forgot the}} names of her {{children}} she would still remember the <b>Cuttle</b> Well. Regardless now of the whispering between Tommy and Elspeth, she sat long over the fire, {{and it is not}} difficult to fathom her thoughts. They were of the Den and the <b>Cuttle</b> Well.|$|R

60|$|Therefore Captain <b>Cuttle</b> {{read the}} {{newspaper}} with profound attention and no comprehension, and therefore Captain <b>Cuttle</b> said nothing whatever about Rob to himself, or admitted to himself that {{he was thinking about}} him, or would recognise in the most distant manner that Rob {{had anything to do with}} his feeling as lonely as Robinson Crusoe.|$|R
50|$|Captain <b>Cuttle</b> was a slow-maturing colt {{and was not}} highly-tried at two. He {{made only}} one {{appearance}} on the racecourse, finishing second in a minor race at Doncaster. Captain <b>Cuttle's</b> heavy physique and immaturity put a strain on his forelegs, leading Darling to treat him very carefully, riding the colt himself in most of his exercise work.|$|R

5000|$|Captain <b>Cuttle</b> {{was named}} after the {{character}} in Dickens' novel Dombey and Son. Like his sire, Captain <b>Cuttle</b> was trained throughout his career by Fred Darling at Beckhampton in Wiltshire, and was ridden in his most important races by the leading British jockey of the era Steve Donoghue. The colt was particularly devoted to his trainer, following him [...] "like a pet dog." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no!' said Captain <b>Cuttle,</b> after {{changing}} colour, {{and listening}} to a passing footstep in the street. 'But mind ye, my lad; if any lady, except either of them two as you see t'other day, ever comes and asks for Cap'en <b>Cuttle,</b> be sure to report no person of that name known, nor never heard of here; observe them orders, will you?' ...|$|R

5000|$|There were doubts {{concerning}} the colt's stamina, {{and he started}} at odds of 10/1 {{in a field of}} thirty for the Epsom Derby four weeks later. Captain <b>Cuttle</b> missed the parade for the Derby after a delay caused by a shoeing accident. Allegations were later made in the Daily Express that Captain <b>Cuttle</b> had been illegally injected with cocaine, to combat lameness caused by the incident. Lord Woolavington responded by instituting legal proceedings against the newspaper for libel. Ridden by Donoghue, Captain <b>Cuttle</b> was prominent from the start before moving into the lead entering the straight. He was soon clear and won easily by four lengths from Tamar in a race record time of 2:34.6.|$|R
