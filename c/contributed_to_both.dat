5|$|As a player, Shearer {{was often}} styled {{as a classic}} English centre-forward, owing to his strength, {{physical}} stature, heading ability and strong shot, which enabled him to be highly prolific goalscorer. Of his 206 Newcastle goals, 49 were scored with his head. Earlier in his career, especially at Southampton, Shearer played a more creative role: providing chances for fellow strikers, and making runs into space, owing to his early development as a midfielder. Later on in his career, Shearer played a more forward role, after his age robbed him {{of some of his}} pace. Able to hold the ball up well, he often functioned as a target man, providing balls for other players. Although his strength allowed him {{to hold on to the}} ball, his playing style sometimes brought him criticism – most commonly that his play was too physical, and that he used his elbows too aggressively. It was this which <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> of his sendings off, although one was later rescinded on appeal.|$|E
5|$|By March 2004 {{the cost}} {{had reached the}} sum of £430m (compared to an {{original}} budget of £55m in July 1998 when the architects were appointed). This equates to £85 {{for each of the}} 5.1 million people in Scotland. A report published by the Auditor General for Scotland in July 2004 specifically identified elements that <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> increasing costs and the delay in completing the project. His report criticised the overall management of the project and stated that had the management and construction process been executed better, costs could have been reduced. The report attempted to identify the reasons why there had been an acceleration in cost from £195m in September 2000 to £431m in February 2004 and concluded that over 2000 design changes to the project were a major factor. The building was finally certified for occupation in the Summer of 2004, with the official opening in October of the same year, three years behind schedule.|$|E

In the fifth and final game of the series, Ryan and the Astros held a 5–2 lead entering the 8th inning. But Ryan allowed three consecutive singles before walking in the third run. The Houston bullpen allowed the Phillies to take a 7–5 lead, and only a game-tying Astro rally permitted Ryan to escape the loss.|$|E
500|$|Vane was {{recognised}} by {{his political}} peers as a competent administrator and a wily and persuasive negotiator and politician. [...] His politics {{was driven by}} a desire for religious tolerance {{in an era when}} governments were used to establish official churches and suppress dissenting views. [...] Although his views were in a small minority, he was able to successfully build coalitions to advance his agenda. [...] His actions were often ultimately divisive, and <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> the rise and downfall of the English Commonwealth. [...] His books and pamphlets written on political and religious subjects are still analyzed today, and Vane is remembered in Massachusetts and Rhode Island as an early champion of religious freedom.|$|E

500|$|When Campbell {{took over}} as editor of Astounding, he began to attract {{some of the major}} writers in the field, {{including}} Clifford D. Simak, L. Ron Hubbard, and Jack Williamson. [...] The launch of Unknown strengthened Campbell's dominance of the field; Henry Kuttner, C.L. Moore, and L. Sprague de Camp <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> of Campbell's magazines. [...] As well as developing working relationships with these and other established writers, Campbell [...] discovered and nurtured many new talents. [...] In 1938, he bought Lester del Rey's first story, [...] "Old Faithful"; the following year, he published the first stories of A.E. van Vogt, Robert A. Heinlein, and Theodore Sturgeon, along with an early story by Isaac Asimov. [...] All these writers were strongly associated with Astounding over the next few years, and the period starting with Campbell's editorship is sometimes called the Golden Age of Science Fiction.|$|E
500|$|Unknown (also {{known as}} Unknown Worlds) was an American pulp fantasy fiction magazine, {{published}} from 1939 to 1943 by Street & Smith, and edited by John W. Campbell. [...] Unknown was {{a companion to}} Street & Smith's science fiction pulp, Astounding Science Fiction, which was also edited by Campbell at the time; many authors and illustrators <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> magazines. [...] The leading fantasy magazine in the 1930s was Weird Tales, which focused on shock and horror. Campbell wanted to publish a fantasy magazine with more finesse and humor than Weird Tales, and put his plans into action when Eric Frank Russell sent him the manuscript of his novel Sinister Barrier, about aliens who own the human race. Unknowns first issue appeared in March 1939; in addition to Sinister Barrier, it included H. L. Gold's [...] "Trouble With Water", a humorous fantasy about a New Yorker who meets a water gnome. [...] Gold's story {{was the first of}} many in Unknown to combine commonplace reality with the fantastic.|$|E
500|$|... "Ocean" [...] {{generally}} received {{praise from}} contemporary music critics. Heather Phares from AllMusic applauded {{its role as}} the closing track on Silver Eye for containing [...] "operatic drama" [...] and an [...] "industrial crunch". Similarly, Anna Gaca from Spin found it necessary for [...] "Ocean" [...] to be the album's final track; she wrote that it [...] "is so heavy and foreboding that is practically has to end the album, for fear of sinking it if were it to appear any earlier in the sequence". Additionally, Gaca claimed that the listener could decipher the outside collaborators that <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> [...] "Ocean" [...] and album track [...] "Zodiac Black". Calling it a [...] "rather dramatic close" [...] on the album, Chiu from Consequence of Sound speculated {{that it may be}} Goldfrapp's [...] "heaviest and most emotional song" [...] from their recently recorded material. Listing [...] "Ocean" [...] as an example, The Guardians Alexis Petridis said that the Haxan Cloak's production on several tracks on Silver Eye seemed like a [...] "conscious attempt to meld the two polarities of Goldfrapp's sound". Because of this, she thought that the song [...] "prickle with chilly malevolence". Olivia Riggio, a writer for The Ithacan, complimented Goldfrapp's vocals and the [...] "ominous and powerful" [...] lyrics; she stated that the song should in fact [...] "be called 'Odyssey' because it is an epic". However, Sam Steiger of Hot Press was more negative to the song, stating that although it's interesting, [...] "overall the sensation is of treading water".|$|E

The Annekes would later move to the U.S., where each became Republican Party supporters. Anneke's brother, Emil Anneke, was a founder of the Republican party in Michigan. [...] Fritz Anneke achieved the rank of colonel and became the commanding officer of the 34th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the Civil War; Mathilde Anneke <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> the abolitionist and suffrage movements of the United States.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of his presidency, Reagan ended the price controls on domestic oil which had been started by Richard Nixon; they had <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> the 1973 Oil Crisis and the 1979 Energy Crisis. The price of oil subsequently dropped, and the 1980s did not see the gasoline lines and fuel shortages that the 1970s had. Reagan also attempted to make good on his 1980 campaign promise to repeal the [...] "Windfall Profit Tax" [...] that Carter and Congress enacted in 1980 on domestic oil production; he was able to do so in 1988, when Congress agreed that it had increased dependence on foreign oil. The tax was not a tax on profits, but an excise tax on the difference between a statutory [...] "base price" [...] and the market price.|$|E
2500|$|Distorted {{accounts}} of apes may have <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> the ancient and medieval {{conception of the}} wild man. In his Natural History Pliny the Elder describes a race of silvestres, wild creatures in India who had humanoid bodies but a coat of fur, fangs, and no capacity to speak - a description that fits gibbons indigenous to the area. The ancient Carthaginian explorer Hanno the Navigator (fl. 500 BC) reported an encounter with a tribe of savage men and hairy women in {{what may have been}} Sierra Leone; their interpreters called them [...] "Gorillae," [...] a story which much later originated the name of the gorilla species and could indeed have related to a great ape. Similarly, the Greek historian Agatharchides describes what may have been chimpanzees as tribes of agile, promiscuous [...] "seed-eaters" [...] and [...] "wood-eaters" [...] living in Ethiopia.|$|E

Ciara also co-wrote and co-produced [...] "Sorry", the song that was chosen to supersede [...] "Sweat" [...] as one of One Woman Armys two lead singles, along with [...] "Got Me Good", also written by Ciara. None of these records made the final album. [...] "Sorry" [...] was co-written and co-produced by Jasper Cameron, who previously worked with Ciara on her 2006 single [...] "Promise" [...] and 2009 single [...] "Never Ever". Together the duo wrote and produced [...] "Super Turnt Up" [...] which did make the final listing for Ciara. [...] "Got Me Good" [...] was co-written with Rodney Jerkins and Livvi Franc (Olivia Waith).
