40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{difficulties}} of providing adequate treatment experi-ences during training are discussed {{with reference to}} the inter-dependence of symptoms within family groups. To illustrate this the treatment of an eleven-year-old boy at a child guidance clinic is described. During this, several instances of gross psychopathology within the family group emerged which exposed the limitations of the initial treatment model. The case is discussed with respect to internalization of treatment models dur-ing <b>training.</b> <b>Counsellors</b> <b>in</b> <b>training</b> can now encounter a wide range of techniques and strategies designed to facilitate a therapeutic role. Under appro-priate supervision during the practicum they can, in addition to more conventional counseling approaches, explore behavior modification models (Blackman & Silberman, 1971) and various techniques of de-sensitization and reciprocal inhibition (Eysenck, 1964; Wolpe, 1964). The implications of such methods for therapeutic practice are abl...|$|R

40|$|Aims: This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{reliability}} of the Person Centred and Experiential Psychotherapy Scale (PCEPS), a new adherence/competence measure of person-centred and experiential psychotherapies. The PCEPS consists of 15 items with two subscales: Person Centred Process, and Experiential Process. Method: One-hundred twenty audio-recorded segments of therapy sessions were rated independently by two teams of three raters using the PCEPS. Half of the segments were 10 min long and the other half were 15 min long. Six therapists were experienced therapists and four were <b>counsellors</b> <b>in</b> <b>training.</b> Seven of the therapists identified their work as 'person-centred’, and three identifed their work as 'process-experiential'. Three raters were qualified and experienced person- centred therapists and three raters were person-centred counselling trainees in their first year of training. Results: Interrater reliabilities were good (alpha:. 68 -. 86), especially when ratings were averaged across items (alpha:. 87); interitem reliabilities were quite high (alpha:. 98). Exploratory factor analyses revealed a 12 -item facilitative relationship factor that cuts across Person-centred and Experiential subscales (alpha:. 98), and a nonfacilitative directiveness factor (3 items, alpha:. 89).

40|$|ABSTRACT: IPR (Interpersonal Process Recall) {{is proving}} to be an ef-fective method using {{videotape}} procedures to help <b>counsellors</b> <b>in</b> <b>training</b> become more sensitively aware of their own reactions and their effect on others. Most importantly, this process is an encouraging, growth-inducing one with potential for uses with other groups concerned with personal relationships. OVERVIEW The research which {{led to the development of}} the Interpersonal Process Recall (IPR) method addressed itself to the fundamental question: Can we improve the ways in which people relate to each other? Can reliable methods be developed to teach people to live with each other without inflicting pain? Can we improve the mental health of our society? In 1962 my colleagues and I observed that stimulated recall (Bloom, 1954) by means of videotape and assisted by a person serving as an "inquirer " could help people understand themselves better, recognize their impact on others, realize the impact of others on them, and could allow people an unusual opportunity to try out new interpersonal modes of relating and responding. Our (David R. Krathwohl and William W. Farquhar were co-re-searchers with me during the first four years of IPR) first use of the medium was an attempt to develop a test of situation empathy o...|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the usefulness of}} applying key concepts of the Rogerian theory of ‘becoming a person’ as a framework to theorise the personal growth and change process of becoming a counsellor. It is contended that person-centred philosophy and theory provides {{one way in which}} to view the personal development of the person of counsellor during training. This hypothesis is based on the recognition of a perceived similar change and growth process which Rogers identified in clients in therapy, with those of training counsellors. After reviewing the literature on the importance placed on the personal development of <b>counsellors</b> <b>in</b> <b>training,</b> a distinction is made between personal development and personal growth. An apparent gap is identified within undergraduate training. It is recognised that some students, in particular mature students, training at undergraduate tertiary level for the first time, have unique challenges from those within post graduate programmes. A further gap within the literature is the self-study of a student’s own experience and perceptions of undertaking counsellor training at this level. Therefore, fitting the above demographic, the author retrospectively examines her personal experience using an autoethnographic method of enquiry. With this method the researcher is both an “insider” and “outsider” (Dyson, 2007, p. 39) of the cultural context under investigation. Autoethnographic data consists of a poem titled: School Reports, which contains the story of a failed high school student. Other data are drawings created using the metaphor of an acorn growing into an oak tree to symbolise Rogers’s theoretical propositions of a theory of personality and behaviour. Reflective journal entries written during undergraduate counsellor training further support the analysis. The author’s poem and drawings form the basis of an autoethnographic inquiry analysed through a number of Rogerian philosophical concepts of development along with ‘moments of movement’ towards change and growth. The main focus of personal growth and change centres on the author’s early development of the self-concept of a failed high school student, revised to a self-concept of successful, due to the curative experience of training. The conclusion is made that the primary Rogerian theoretical concept of becoming a person, the organism’s tendency to actualise, along with its “moments of movement” (Rogers, 1961, p. 130), can provide one way in which to conceptualise the personal growth and change process <b>in</b> becoming a <b>counsellor.</b> Implications for counsellor education is the consideration of facilitating growth promoting learning environments and learning opportunities. The principal limitation of the study is identified as applying classic person-centred theory as a framework whereas contemporary theorising would consider the person in both context and environment. A self-study on just one experience of a mature student <b>in</b> undergraduate <b>training</b> was also considered a limitation. Both these limitations warrant further investigation. A further recommendation for further research is a comparative study examining the personal growth and change process of <b>counsellors</b> <b>in</b> <b>training</b> from different philosophical positions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{tested the}} general {{hypothesis}} that categories {{of information about}} a client would influence the counsellors overall judgement {{to the extent that}} the categories are meaningful to the judge. Twenty subjects (13 <b>counsellors</b> <b>in</b> <b>training</b> and 7 professional counsellors) were given 55 statements made by a single client. Subjects were asked to form as clear an impression of the client's personality as they could from the statements. Subjects sorted the statements into categories using category titles of their own choosing. For each category subjects operationalized their impressions of the client by completing a rating scale comprised of 12 bipolar dimensions. Subjects then rated their overall impression of the client based upon the statements in all categories. Meaningfulness of a category was defined by items (number of statements in a category), extremity (sum of the absolute difference from scale mid-point), and centrality (loading on first principle component). Category influence was defined as a category's variance-in-common with the overall judgement. For each subject the three indices of meaningfulness (items, extremity, centrality), were correlated with category influence. [...] The results showed the three meaningfulness indices differed in their ability to predict category influence upon overall judgement. The centrality index was found to be a better predictor than either the items or extremity index. It was concluded that meaningfulness of a category was able to predict a category's influence upon overall judgement. However, predictiveness varied with the index of meaningfulness used...|$|R

40|$|We {{live in a}} multicultural, globalised world, <b>in</b> which <b>counsellors</b> and psychotherapists are {{increasingly}} required to work across languages and cultures. Existing literature, however, focuses largely on the needs and experiences of foreign clients, often overlooking {{the other half of}} the therapeutic dyad. This thesis tackles the under-researched area of foreign practitioners who work in a host environment. Given the ongoing cultural enrichment of <b>counsellor</b> education <b>in</b> Britain and the demanding character of counselling <b>training</b> <b>in</b> general, this work focuses on one sub-group of this population, namely <b>counsellors</b> <b>in</b> <b>training.</b> To that end, this thesis explores foreign counselling trainees’ experiences of practising in a second language and culture. Underpinned by hermeneutic phenomenology, methodologically this project draws upon the principles of Smith, Flowers and Larkin’s (2009) Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The investigation consists of two empirical studies based on semi-structured interviews with A) non-native speaking and B) native speaking, foreign trainees in their counselling placement. This research design aims to investigate the phenomenon of beginning intercultural counselling from a holistic perspective rather than compare the two groups’ experiences. Overall, findings reveal the numerous ways in which linguistic and cultural difference influence trainees’ experiences of beginning intercultural/interlinguistic practice. The experience of difference appears to mainly impact on trainees’ practitioner identity rather than their perception of practice. Despite the complexities participants encounter, their accounts expose self-efficacy, revealing a position of viewing ‘deficit’ as advantageous. Moreover, findings indicate that the more ‘tangible’ difference is, the more readily trainees acknowledge and discuss its presence in counselling practice. This is largely related to intersubjectivity and encounters with others during training and practice. At the same time, participants’ accounts demonstrate that ‘nativeness/non-nativeness’ is not purely a matter of linguistic mastery, but largely intertwined with familiarity with the host culture. To that end, this thesis proposes that counsellor education ought to address difference, and non-nativeness in particular, from a broader perspective, advance the support provided to foreign trainees and provide opportunities for discussion that will promote all trainees’ cultural awareness...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the findings of}} the learning needs assessment described in this issue. Limitations and strengths are discussed. The paper describes a national, multi-sectoral, multidisciplinary picture. Our respondents may over-represent those with an interest in breastfeeding; if so, the true picture may be even more problematic than described here. Major deficits were identified in the knowledge and skills of practitioners from all backgrounds and all sectors. Many professionals report poor knowledge about breastfeeding and have low levels of confidence and clinical competence. Organizational constraints and barriers to effective education and practice include fragmentation of care and education, lack of facilities, and a low priority being given to breastfeeding. There is a range of current educational provision, although not all is fit for purpose. Voluntary organizations seem to have higher standards than do some current professional learning opportunities. Preferred methods of training include practical observation and mentorship, volunteer <b>counsellor</b> involvement <b>in</b> <b>training</b> programmes, as well as self-study and online opportunities. Recommendations include: a funded, mandatory, interagency and multidisciplinary approach; appropriate content; support at local and national levels; breastfeeding education to be included in clinical governance and audit mechanisms; and further research and evaluation to examine optimum ways of providing education and training.

40|$|M. Ed. One of {{the primary}} goals of the Educational Psychology honours {{programme}} at the University of Johannesburg is to support school counsellors to think critically and reflectively about their counselling practice in diverse educational contexts in order to continually improve that practice. During a six month school counsellors practicum {{students are encouraged to}} reflect on and analyse their experiences individually and in class. These reflections {{are an important part of}} students’ learning as through analysis and reflection they begin to connect theory and practice and learn how to critically examine the relationship between education and society. Therefore the purpose of reflective self-evaluation is to provide school <b>counsellor’s</b> <b>in</b> <b>training</b> with a mechanism for developing a deep understanding of the complex relationship between learning and practical experience (Abernathy, De Raad, Beck, Checho, Furno, et al., 2008, p. 149). In 1987, Donald Schön introduced the concept of reflective practice as a critical process in refining one's skill in a specific discipline (Ferraro, 2000). Schön (1992) recommended reflective practice as a way for beginners in a discipline to recognise consonance between their own individual practices and those of successful practitioners. This research focuses on the student school counsellor and efforts to promote reflective practice through the use of blogging, an online technology. This research study examines the student school counsellors perception of blogging as a tool to promote reflective practice during their practicum experience. A class reflective blog was implemented for a four week trial period in order for the students to gain experience of reflective blogging. The researcher acted as the facilitator of reflection in the blog. The role of the facilitator was to respond to the blog posts by asking reflective questions. The students were encouraged to engage in reflective dialogue with the facilitator and the other students. Individual and focus groups interviews were structured to collect information on the students perceptions of blogging as a tool to promote reflective practice. The student school counsellors perceived blogging as a strategy that promotes reflective practice. They viewed the experience as beneficial and that blogging encouraged the development of reflection into deeper reflections. They valued the iii facilitators comments and engaged in reflective dialogue with her. The blog was also perceived as a tool that provided peer learning and support, however, lack of participation by all students compromised peer learning and support. Recommendations were made by the students in order to enhance the reflective blogging experience. Training institutions looking to elevate the reflective practice component of professional development should consider blogging as an option.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades {{interest}} in multicultural dimensions of therapeutic practice has increased, reflecting political and social change, so that it is no longer confined to the page. However, the responses of some black counsellors and clients indicate that what has been and continues to be produced in transcultural literature has not sufficiently transferred into practice. This suggests a gap <b>in</b> <b>counsellor</b> <b>training.</b> At the heart of the gap is the research question. How do trainee <b>counsellors</b> <b>in</b> Britain understand concerns about black issues, raised by themselves during their training or about clients during the therapeutic process? Increasing diversity in student populations has paralleled legislative demands to provide services for the wider multicultural population. This raises a further question of whether training that fails to address the dynamics of racism, and experiences that relate to black peoples' is inadequate. Developments in social policy are a necessity for creating frameworks to address power structures that maintain marginalised voices. The Race Relations Act 1976 (Amended Act 2000) now gives public authorities including Higher Education, a 'statutory general duty to promote race equality'. (CRE. 2002). The Act suggests that 'we' as a community of practitioners are responsible for change in the educational process. In view of this responsibility this study shows the challenges of enabling and empowering trainees to discover the voice of change within their training experience. The study is based on evidence that <b>counsellors</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> a variety of settings had not received sufficient input to support the experiences of black people either <b>in</b> <b>training</b> or counselling settings. In addition, today's trainees have been asking questions about how to actively engage with black issues in the role of counsellor. To address this problem the study places <b>counsellor</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> Higher Education under the spotlight. It invites the organisation to be active in equal opportunities and combines qualitative with multicultural action research and practice at the source of counselling. Elements of these research paradigms supported the transformative and emancipatory nature of the study. However, a flexible approach to their use allowed for the diversity issues embroiled within the context ofthis study. This supported awareness of the ethical implications of 'epistemological power' and 'epistemological racism'. Drawing on a pluralistic approach, the heuristic process of understanding trainee counsellors' relationship with the phenomenon of black issues was explored during training workshops. The study gave voice to trainee counsellors' concerns. It encouraged dialogue about relationships as black people, or with black peoples, that link to the therapeutic process. The researcher's role as black facilitator, tutor, researcher and 'insider outsider' played an important part in both the challenging nature of this study and a model for developing safety and compassion to facilitate the process. Interviews with five established counsellors trained at different points over a twenty year period showed that black issues was a missing element <b>in</b> their <b>training</b> courses. Primary data was collected from the shared concerns of a group of fifty students on three different counsellor training courses. Trainees from one of the courses were followed through into year two of their training. They were offered additional workshops and encouraged to address black issues within assessment criteria of their training. The impact of black issues <b>in</b> their <b>training</b> was shared at verbal evaluation meetings outside of course time. Trainees' narratives made a significant contribution to the primary data collection. Findings demonstrated that themes such as fear and safety were features of trainees' process of exploring and understanding black issues. Three main concepts evolved. These are called 'shared concerns', 'finding a voice' and 'recognition trauma'. The study showed that sharing concerns assisted trainees to find a voice where previously they felt silenced. Their narrative demonstrated that they were keen to find ways of opening a dialogue about black issues, but needed safety to unravel the sticky and often emotional impact of racism. Themes which emerged from the process were those of racism, guilt, history and trust. Reflexive representation of trainees' voices through the data showed that concerns about racism featured highly in their interactions. The outcome demonstrated that firstly space for sharing and exploration <b>in</b> <b>training</b> can model greater confidence in dialogue about black issues in client work. Secondly, the different experiences of black and white trainees must be valued. Thirdly, understanding can be supported by modelling the process and dialogue on black issues. Fourthly, to support the emancipatory and transformative process of the training group the trainer's personal development process must include an understanding of racism and knowledge of black issues. This document reflects creativity in both methodology and presentation. It allows theory to compliment practice and practice to develop counselling and research theory. It may be seen as similar to the reflexive experience of integrative counselling. With this in mind, the reader is invited to share a narrative journey from fear to transformation...|$|R
