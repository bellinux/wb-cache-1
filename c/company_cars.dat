5|$|Biofuel cars {{in general}} get strong tax {{incentives}} in France, including a 0 or 50% reduction {{on the tax}} on new vehicles, and a 40% reduction on CO2 tax for new cars. For <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> there is a corporate car tax free for 2 years and a recovery of 80% of the value added tax (VAT) on E85 vehicles. Also, E85 fuel price is set significantly lower than diesel or gasoline, resulting in E85 at € 0.80, diesel at €1.15, and gasoline at €1.30 per liter, as of April 2007. By May 2008, France had 211 pumps selling E85, even though the government made plans for the installation of up to 500 E85 pumps by year end 2007. French automakers Renault and PSA (Citroen & Peugeot) announced they will start selling FFV cars beginning in the summer 2007.|$|E

As a result, Chancellor Angela Merkel recognized in December 2014 that the government has to provide more incentives to meet the goal of having one million electric cars on the country's roads by 2020.

25|$|The narcissistic manager {{will have}} two main sources of narcissistic supply: inanimate – status symbols like <b>company</b> <b>cars,</b> company-issued {{smartphone}} or prestigious offices with window views; and animate – flattery and attention from colleagues and subordinates. Teammates may find everyday offers of support swiftly turn them into enabling sources of permanent supply, unless they are very careful to maintain proper boundaries. The need to protect such supply networks will prevent the narcissistic managers from taking objective decisions; while long-term strategies will be evaluated according to their potential for attention-gaining for the manager themself. Organizational psychologist Alan Downs wrote a book in 1997 describing corporate narcissism. He explores high-profile corporate leaders (such as Al Dunlap and Robert Allen) who, he suggests, literally have only one thing on their minds: profits. According to Downs, such narrow focus actually may yield positive short-term benefits, but ultimately it drags down individual employees as well as entire companies. Alternative thinking is proposed, and some firms now utilizing these options are examined. Downs' theories are relevant to those suggested by Victor Hill in his book, Corporate Narcissism in Accounting Firms Australia.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} achieve these goals several {{government}} incentives were implemented. Ethanol, as the other biofuels, was exempted of both, the CO2 and energy taxes until 2009, resulting in a 30% price reduction at the pump of E85 fuel over gasoline. Furthermore, other demand side incentives for flexifuel vehicle owners include a [...] bonus to buyers of FFVs, exemption from the Stockholm congestion tax, up to 20% discount on auto insurance, free parking spaces {{in most of the}} largest cities, owner annual registration taxes, and a 20% tax reduction for flexifuel <b>company</b> <b>cars.</b> Also, a part of the program, the Swedish Government ruled that 25% of their vehicle purchases (excluding police, fire and ambulance vehicles) must be alternative fuel vehicles. By the first months of 2008, this package of incentives resulted in sales of flexible-fuel cars representing 25% of new car sales.|$|E

500|$|Gygax {{immediately}} discarded {{his movie}} ambitions—his D movie {{would never be}} made—and flew back to Lake Geneva. There, he discovered to his shock that although industry leader TSR was grossing , it was barely breaking even; {{it was in fact}} [...] in debt and teetering on the edge of insolvency. After investigating the reasons why, Gygax brought his findings to the five other company directors. (Since 1982, TSR Inc. had conformed to the recommendations of the American Management Association by adding three [...] "outside" [...] directors to the board, increasing its size to six.) Gygax charged that the financial crisis was due to mismanagement by Kevin Blume: excess inventory, overstaffing, too many <b>company</b> <b>cars,</b> and some questionable (and expensive) projects such as dredging up a 19th century shipwreck. Gygax demanded that Kevin Blume be removed as company president, and the three outside directors agreed with him. However, the board still believed the financial problems were terminal and the company needed to be sold. In an effort to stay in control, in March 1985, Gygax exercised his 700-share stock option, giving him just over 50% control. He appointed himself president and CEO, and rather than selling the company, he took steps to produce new revenue generating products. To that end, he contacted Dave Arneson with a view to produce some Blackmoor material. He also bet heavily on a new AD book, Unearthed Arcana, a compilation of material culled from Dragon Magazine articles. And he quickly wrote a novel set in his Greyhawk setting, Saga of Old City, featuring a protagonist called Gord the Rogue. In order to bring some financial stability to TSR, he hired a company manager, Lorraine Williams.|$|E

2500|$|A car (or automobile) is a wheeled {{motor vehicle}} used for transportation. [...] Most {{definitions}} of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport {{people rather than}} goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 {{is regarded as the}} birth year of the modern car, when German inventor Karl Benz built his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor <b>Company.</b> <b>Cars</b> were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe {{and other parts of the}} world.|$|E

[...] A portion of the car, usually in the center, is split between two levels, with stairs leading both up and down from the train's regular passenger car floor level. [...] The lower level of the dome usually consisted of a small lounge area, while the upper portion was usually coach or lounge seating within a [...] "bubble" [...] of glass on the car's roof. [...] Budd Co. dome cars used curved class, whereas Pullman <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> used flat panels of glass that were positioned at different angles above the roofline. [...] Passengers in the upper portion of the dome {{were able to see}} in all directions from a vantage point above the train's roof line. [...] On some dome cars, the lower portion was built as a galley, where car attendants used dumbwaiters to transfer items between the galley and a dining area in the dome portion of the car(within the USA, the Union Pacific, prior to Amtrak, was the primary owner/user of 'dome dining cars.')

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Table  9, the results of all three {{statements}} are quite consistent, showing that about two thirds of all respondents believe that <b>company</b> <b>car</b> drivers and privately owned car drivers have different driving styles.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the difference in mileage between <b>company</b> <b>car</b> owners and privately owned car drivers, a regression model of the annual mileage driven {{as reported by the}} respondents was estimated for the pooled data of the two sub-samples. The estimation results of this model, presented in Table  8, show that the coefficient of a dummy variable of <b>company</b> <b>car</b> owner is 8, 483. In other words, all other things being equal, <b>company</b> <b>car</b> drivers annually drive 8, 483  km. more than do privately owned car drivers. Among the socio-economic variables, gender (males drive more), household size (positively related to the mileage driven), and marital status (singles drive more) were found to have the greatest effect on mileage driven. Income was found to be highly correlated with having a <b>company</b> <b>car,</b> and therefore {{it was not possible to}} include this variable in the model.|$|R

A fairly high variance was found in the number of children in a household. A comparison with the socio-economic characteristics of the control group reveals that, as indicated in the market review section, the <b>company</b> <b>car</b> drivers belong to a higher socio-economic level. A significant difference in gender was also found: men composed 76  % of the <b>company</b> <b>car</b> sample population, compared to 60  % of all driving license holders in Israel in 2008 and 45  % of the control group sample population.|$|R
