5|$|From Alaska to Northern California, coastal <b>cutthroat</b> {{trout in}} sea-run, {{resident}} stream and lacustrine forms are sought by anglers. Puget Sound in Washington is a stronghold of sea-run <b>cutthroat</b> trout fishing with its many tributaries and protected saltwater inlets and beaches. Fly anglers search for sea-run <b>cutthroat</b> trout along beaches, river mouths and estuaries year round. In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in drift boats float the rivers searching for trout along the wooded shorelines. In {{addition to a}} <b>cutthroat</b> trout sport fishery managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Federal Subsistence Management Program manages coastal <b>cutthroat</b> trout subsistence fisheries in Southeast Alaska.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River fine-spotted <b>cutthroat</b> trout (or Snake River <b>cutthroat</b> trout) is {{the only}} native trout species in Grand Teton National Park. It is also the only {{subspecies}} of <b>cutthroat</b> trout that is exclusively native to large streams and rivers. Various researchers {{have not been able}} to identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine-spotted <b>cutthroat</b> trout and the Yellowstone <b>cutthroat</b> trout, though in terms of appearances, the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots which cover a greater portion of the body, and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches. The Snake River fine-spotted <b>cutthroat</b> trout was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid-1990s, and is managed as a distinct subspecies by the state of Wyoming, but is not yet recognized as such by the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana. Snake River fine-spotted <b>cutthroat</b> trout is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho. Other non-native species of trout such as the rainbow trout and lake trout were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone. Today five trout species inhabit park waters. Native species of fish include the mountain whitefish, longnose dace, mountain sucker and non-native species include the Utah chub and Arctic grayling.|$|E

50|$|After {{months of}} rumors, and speculation, on August 20, 2014, the Denver <b>Cutthroats</b> {{announced}} an immediate suspension of operations and elected for dormancy for the 2014-15 season. All {{players of the}} <b>Cutthroats</b> were rendered free agents, however the <b>Cutthroats</b> planned to seek additional investors to re-join the league for the 2015-16 season.|$|R
50|$|Finally, on May 17, 2012, the <b>Cutthroats</b> officially {{announced}} their name, logo, and color scheme. With {{the addition of}} the <b>Cutthroats,</b> the CHL aligned to the one Berry Conference. The <b>Cutthroats</b> opened the season in Denver against the Missouri Mavericks on October 19, marking the first hockey game in the Coliseum since 1989.|$|R
50|$|The greenback <b>cutthroat's</b> {{maximum size}} is 18 in. It {{has the largest}} spots of all <b>cutthroats</b> and is {{reported}} to have the most brilliant spawning coloration. Like all <b>cutthroats,</b> it has red coloration {{in the area of the}} lower jaw and throat. Historically, it has been reported to grow as large as 4.5 kg.|$|R
5|$|Behnke in his {{salmon and}} trout {{handbook}} of 2002 recognized 14 subspecies of <b>cutthroat</b> trout that are each native to a separate geographic area. Not {{all of them were}} scientifically described, and different views on the taxonomic identities have been presented in some cases. It has been suggested that the <b>cutthroat</b> trout evolved from a common Oncorhynchus ancestor that migrated along the Pacific coast and into the mountain west primarily via the Columbia and Snake river basins 3-5million years ago, in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene epochs. These epochs had repeated glacial and interglacial periods that would have caused repeated fracturing and isolation of <b>cutthroat</b> trout populations, eventually resulting in the different subspecies found today. The 14 subspecies are found in four evolutionary groups—Coastal, Westslope, Yellowstone and Lahontan.|$|E
5|$|Eighteen {{species of}} fish live in Yellowstone, {{including}} the core range of the Yellowstone <b>cutthroat</b> trout—a fish highly sought by anglers. The Yellowstone <b>cutthroat</b> trout has faced several threats since the 1980s, including the suspected illegal introduction into Yellowstone Lake of lake trout, an invasive species which consume the smaller <b>cutthroat</b> trout. Although lake trout were established in Shoshone and Lewis lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. Government stocking operations in 1890, it was never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage. The <b>cutthroat</b> trout has also faced an ongoing drought, {{as well as the}} accidental introduction of a parasite—whirling disease—which causes a terminal nervous system disease in younger fish. Since 2001, all native sport fish species caught in Yellowstone waterways are subject to a catch and release law. Yellowstone is also home to six species of reptiles, such as the painted turtle and Prairie rattlesnake, and four species of amphibians, including the Boreal Chorus Frog.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{species of fish}} reside in park waters and native game fish species found in the lakes and streams include the westslope <b>cutthroat</b> trout, {{northern}} pike, mountain whitefish, kokanee salmon and Arctic grayling. Glacier {{is also home to}} the threatened bull trout, which is illegal to possess and must be returned to the water if caught inadvertently. Introduction in previous decades of lake trout and other non-native fish species has greatly impacted some native fish populations, especially the bull trout and west slope <b>cutthroat</b> trout.|$|E

50|$|After {{six years}} abroad in Europe, on August 14, 2012, Smyth {{returned}} to North America and {{was signed by}} head coach and former teammate Derek Armstrong to a one-year contract with the newly established Denver <b>Cutthroats</b> of the Central Hockey League. Despite his age, Smyth showed no loss in ability with the <b>Cutthroats,</b> in forming the league's top scoring line alongside A.J. Gale and Troy Schwab, with 23 goals and 78 points in 65 games. After the <b>Cutthroats</b> first round loss to eventual champions, the Allen Americans, Smyth announced {{the end of his}} 20-year playing career by accepting an assistant coach and assistant director of hockey operations role within the <b>Cutthroats</b> on June 4, 2013.After a successful season behind the bench with the CHLs Denver, <b>Cutthroats,</b> he was promoted to director of hockey operation and head coach.|$|R
50|$|With the {{intention}} to skate in the Denver <b>Cutthroats</b> celebrity charity hockey game at the Denver Coliseum, Cullaton came out of retirement and signed a 5-game playing contract with the short-handed <b>Cutthroats</b> on February 5, 2013.|$|R
5|$|Near {{the east}} end of the park, the {{free-flowing}} reaches of Balch Creek support a population of resident <b>cutthroat</b> trout. Near the west end, furthest from the city center, Miller Creek retains much of its historic nature and supports a greater diversity of aquatic organisms than other Forest Park streams. Biological field surveys of Miller Creek in 1990 noted sea-run <b>cutthroat</b> trout, coho salmon, and short-head cottid, as well as abundant macroinvertebrate species including stoneflies, mayflies, caddisflies, water striders, and crayfish.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone National Park was {{established}} in 1872. By the 1890s, the Yellowstone <b>cutthroat</b> trout fishery in the Yellowstone River and Yellowstone Lake were well known and being promoted in national guidebooks.|$|E
5|$|Although heavily polluted, {{the creek}} {{supports}} aquatic life, including coastal <b>cutthroat</b> trout (leopard spotted) in its upper reaches. Watershed councils {{such as the}} Fans of Fanno Creek and government agencies have worked to limit pollution and to restore native vegetation in riparian zones.|$|E
50|$|In the Final, the <b>Cutthroats</b> {{once more}} faced the {{defending}} champions in the Allen Americans who had dispatched them a year earlier. After taking game 1, the <b>Cutthroats</b> again lost 4 straight games, allowing Allen to win back-to-back championships.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{following}} 2013-14 season, a vastly improved <b>Cutthroats</b> team, {{with the help}} of CHL MVP Garett Bembridge, recorded 38 wins, and the 2nd seed in the Ray Miron's President's Cup Playoffs. The <b>Cutthroats</b> won their first playoff series in team history, defeating the Tulsa Oilers in 6 games before advancing to the Finals after a 4:1 series win over the Arizona Sundogs. Marking the <b>Cutthroats</b> first berth in the Ray Miron Cup Final in only their second year of existence.|$|R

5|$|Before its release, many journalists {{expected}} Pirates of the Caribbean to be a flop. The pirate genre had {{not been}} successful for years, with <b>Cutthroat</b> Island (1995) being a notable flop. The film was also based on a theme park ride, and Depp, known mostly for starring in cult films at the time, had little track record as a box office leading man.|$|E
5|$|Rainbow trout, chinook and coho salmon, and Pacific Lamprey are {{the most}} common {{anadromous}} fish that inhabit Big Butte Creek. They travel as far as Butte Falls, sometimes passing over it during high flows. Because of the cold, sterile conditions of the water and the difficulty of jumping over the Butte Creek waterfall, streams above Butte Falls have very low populations of anadromous fish. Native, resident fish in this area include coastal <b>cutthroat</b> and rainbow trout. Willow Lake contains largemouth bass and rainbow, <b>cutthroat,</b> and brook trout. Overall, the number of fish in the Big Butte Creek watershed has declined in recent years, possibly due to the clearing of riparian zones and rising water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{streams and}} lakes around Adams offer {{a number of}} fish for the angler to seek out. The two most common species, eastern brook trout and rainbow trout (Columbia River redband trout), are in nearly every lake and stream. Brown trout and <b>cutthroat</b> trout appear {{in most of the}} lakes in the High Lakes Area and three lakes are home to tiger trout. All the lakes in the High Lakes Area are {{periodically}} replanted with varying species of trout. Bull trout {{can be found in the}} upper reaches of the Klickitat and Lewis Rivers. Westslope <b>cutthroat</b> trout can be found the Klickitat and <b>cutthroat</b> trout are found in the Lewis River and upper reaches of the Cispus River. Whitefish can be found in the Klickitat, Lewis, and Cispus Rivers. Because of barriers to fish passage (dams on the Lewis and Cowlitz Rivers, falls on the White Salmon River), the only river where anadromous fishes can reach the streams around Adams is the Klickitat River. Chinook salmon, coho salmon, and steelhead, in several different runs, make for the upper reaches of the Klickitat, including those around Adams, every year.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cutthroat</b> {{competition}} {{was nothing to}} what was to follow. The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and {{a rising tide of}} anti-Semitism made it an even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained were more interested in politics than in theater: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting Der Veker (The Awakener).|$|E
5|$|Large {{populations of}} salmon {{inhabited}} the creek before urban construction altered the watershed and the stream channel, {{and in the}} 21stcentury, the creek and its tributaries still provide habitat for smaller numbers of chinook and coho salmon, steelhead, and coastal <b>cutthroat</b> trout.

5|$|The Austin Heights area {{contains}} Como Lake, {{a renowned}} urban fishing and recreation area, and headwaters for the Como watershed. The watershed {{represents one of}} the last urban watersheds in the Tri-Cities that supports wild stocks of coho salmon as well as other species at risk such as coastal <b>cutthroat</b> trout (both sea-run and resident) and bird species such as the great blue heron and green heron. It also contains Mundy Park, one of the largest urban parks in the Metro Vancouver area.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of bull trout and other native {{species of fish}} in Banff's lakes has also dwindled, {{with the introduction of}} non-native species including brook trout, and rainbow trout. Lake trout, westslope <b>cutthroat</b> trout, and Chiselmouth are rare native species, while chinook salmon, White sturgeon, Pacific lamprey, and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an extinct species.|$|E
5|$|Basalt, mostly {{covered by}} silt in the uplands and {{sediment}} in the lowlands, underlies the Balch Creek watershed. The {{upper part of}} the watershed includes private residential land, the Audubon Society of Portland nature sanctuary, and part of Forest Park. Mixed conifer forest of Coast Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock with a well-developed understory of shrubs and flowering plants is the natural vegetation. Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112species of birds use Forest Park. A small population of coastal <b>cutthroat</b> trout resides in the stream, which in 2005 was the only major water body in Portland that met state standards for bacteria, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.|$|E
50|$|On May 11, 2012, Patterson {{signed his}} first {{professional}} contract by signing to a two-year entry level {{deal with the}} Avalanche. After initially attending American Hockey League affiliate, the Lake Erie Monsters training camp, Patterson was re-assigned to make his pro debut to start the 2012-13 season with the Denver <b>Cutthroats</b> of the CHL, a secondary affiliate of the Avalanche. Patterson started in the <b>Cutthroats</b> inaugural game and recorded his first professional win over the Missouri Mavericks on October 19, 2012. Patterson's impressive play behind the <b>Cutthroats</b> defense was rewarded when he {{was selected as the}} CHL's Goaltender and Rookie of the Month award for November.
