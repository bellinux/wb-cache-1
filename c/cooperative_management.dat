40|$|The {{business}} environment of rice farming has deteriorated {{because of the}} continuous decline in rice prices since the late 1990 s. In regions where agricultural land is actively bought and sold,large-scale farmers have a heavier debt burden than small-scale farmers. Towards finding {{a way out of}} these circumstances, farmers have started“incorporated cooperative farm management”. This paper aims at identifying the improvements in farm management that are brought by incorporated <b>cooperative</b> farm <b>management.</b> First,the historical background of such management is analyzed. In areas where large-scale rice farming predominates,smaller farmers have pursued organizational restructuring toward achieving incorporated <b>cooperative</b> farm <b>management.</b> Being heavily indebted,these farmers formed cooperatives for shared use of farm machinery and joint ownership of farmland. These efforts, however,failed to ameliorate their cash-flow problems. Second,a survey shows that incorporated <b>cooperative</b> farm <b>management</b> has brought about positive results, including improvement of investment conditions. The rationalization of production that is achieved by incorporated <b>cooperative</b> farm <b>management</b> is characterized by several advantages: 1) Operating efficiency is enhanced because the lot size of each paddy field is increased and each different rice variety is grown collectively in adjoining paddy fields; 2) Competition between farm operations is avoided; 3) Fertilizer application management is upgraded because responsibilities are divided among farmers for various crop varieties;and 4) Farming on a larger scale offsets the risks of trial growing. Additionally,analysis was conducted to identify attitudinal and local conditions that affect the success of farm management improvement efforts. Third,analysis of management in terms of profitability and financial stability reveals that incorporated <b>cooperative</b> farm <b>management</b> helps to increase the value added as a result of modified use of paddy fields,rationalization of production and upgrading of farm management. It is also indicates that incorporated <b>cooperative</b> farm <b>management</b> provides each <b>cooperative</b> member with a level of income that enables debts to be paid off. Incorporated <b>cooperative</b> farm <b>management</b> also affords financial stability. In conclusion,incorporated <b>cooperative</b> farm <b>management</b> is a form of farm management by principal farmers in agricultural regions where agricultural land is actively bought and sold and farmers face difficulties in individually sustaining their farms...|$|R

Our research intention was to categorize the constructs of the following fundamental concept: “vertical <b>cooperative</b> promotion <b>management</b> decision”. A critical hermeneutics approach was adopted for the present study. Our proposition was an extension of the win-win-win papakonstantinidis conceptualization, which led us to “win-win-win spais-papakonstantinidis-papakonstantinidis model”, an innovative bargaining solution analysis for vertical <b>cooperative</b> promotion <b>management</b> decisions applied to a paradigm of a hotel, including three (3) adjusted utility functions...|$|R

40|$|Although {{fisheries}} management {{is a complex}} task, many {{countries in the world}} have managed to develop {{fisheries management}} regimes that can improve the economic efficiency of the fisheries. Property rights-based fisheries management regimes have shown promising results in the management of fisheries resources since they reduce or eliminate the incentives for over-capitalisation in harvesting of the fisheries resources and thus contribute to economic efficiency. Community-based <b>cooperative</b> fisheries <b>management</b> is one of the property rightsbased fisheries management systems, which has received attention in recent years particularly in the developing countries. In Tanzania, community-based <b>cooperative</b> fisheries <b>management</b> seems a feasible option because the current system is entirely based on common property and an open access approach.
