40|$|Interest {{in the use}} {{of natural}} fibers as fillers has grown {{over the past few years}} due to the {{advantages}} it offers. The use of oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) as fillers in the unplasticised poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC-U) is a new attraction in the polymer composite technology. The objectives of the study is to investigate the effects of EFB fillers, screw speeds and processing temperature on processability and mechanical properties of filled and impact modified PVC-U composite extrudates. To produce the composite extrudates, the PVC resin and the additives were firstly dry blended using high speed mixer before being extruded into sheets using single screw extruder. Test specimens were prepared and shaped using <b>cutter</b> <b>machine</b> after which impact, flexural and tensile properties were determined. The results showed that only EFB-filled PVC-U composite incorporated with 10 phr of filler can be extruded with the smoother surface whereas at 20 phr the extrudates surfaces changed to be rough. The impact strength of acrylic-impact modified and EFB-filled acrylic-impact modified extrudates increased while CPE-impact modified and EFB-filled extrudates decreased as the screw speed increased. Meanwhile the flexural properties extrudates decreased as the screw speed increased. In terms of temperature effects, the maximum impact strength of impact modified occurred at temperature of 180 Â°C while EFB-filled and EFB-filled acrylic-impact modified occurred at 185 Â°C. The flexural modulus slightly increased while the flexural strength slightly decreased with the increase of temperature. The yield stress and yield strain of extrudates were insignificantly affected by screw speeds but slightly increased as temperature increased. The yield stress, yield strain and fusion level of extrudates increased with temperature. The overall results showed that the temperature more influence the processability and mechanical properties of both the unmodified of and impact modified extrudates compared to screw speed. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} written in {{cooperation}} with the Robbins Company to: - Document the effect of using large diameter cutters (19 ”) compared to smaller diameters (17 ”) - Document the effect of using 20 ” cutter rings on 19 ” cutters - Evaluate Robbins estimation methods to the NTNU-method and the recorded data. The report starts with a short introduction to cutter wear and the factors influencing on it. Before presenting acalculation of the effects the difference cutter diameters theoretical will have on advance rate and cutter life. The calculations suggest an advance rate of a 10 meter diameter TBM with 17 ” cutters being 77. 3 % of the rate of aTBM with 19 ” cutters. The 20 ” cutters will have an advance rate of 91. 3 % of the 19 ” <b>cutter</b> <b>machine.</b> The cutter lifein hours is calculated to be 13 % lower for a machine with 17 ” cutters than a machine with 19 ”. The effect of using 20 ” cutter rings is calculated to extend the cutter life in hours with 16 %. The field work on the thesis is done on two 10 m diameter double shield TBMs boring in India, the AMR 1 projectand the Veligonda Project. Both machines are utilizing 19 ” with 20 ” cutter rings. The geological conditions arevarying for both projects. The field testing and the lab testing is done according to the NTNU model and includes net penetration tests andchip analysis. The processing and calculations are done according to the NTNU-model. The AMR 1 project has had an average penetration rate of 1. 62 m/h and a cutter life of 1. 25 h/c, or 2. 02 m/h. TheVeligonda project has an average penetration rate slightly higher 1. 90 m/h. The cutter life has been significantly higher with 12. 75 h/c in the first period at the project. On the second period it was a change in the geology and thecutter life was reduced to 1. 90 h/c. The utilization rates for the projects have been generally low with an averagemachine utilization of around 30 %. When comparing the results to comparable projects it gives the following indications: - The advance rate is significantly improved when using large cutter diameters. - The 20 ” cutter rings have a beneficial effect on weekly advance rates in hard and abrasive rock. - The 20 ” cutter rings gives a slight economic saving in hard and abrasive rock compared to 19 ” cutter rings. The estimation of the AMR project from NTNU and Robbins has some major differences. This has been looked at indetail and it gives an indication of a systematically overestimation in advance rate and cutter life for the Robbinsestimates. This leads to an underestimation of the cutter costs of the AMR 1 project. The biggest differences in theestimates are at the AMR 2 where the boring still has not started.  </p...|$|E

The relative position of the cutter and workpiece is calculated under the workpiece coordinate system, and the <b>cutter</b> <b>machining</b> trajectory can be described precisely and smoothly using this method. The three nonuniform rational basis spline curves are transformed into a 12 -dimentional Bézier curve to carry out discretization during the discrete process. With the cutter contact point trajectory as the precision control condition, the discretization is fast. As for different cutters and corners, the complete description method of space cutter compensation vector is presented in this article.
