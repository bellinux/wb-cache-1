Our analysis shows that IS, CRP, and VMI bring varying benefits in terms of inventory cost savings to firms, and that the benefits are not consistently distributed between retailers and manufacturers. Our findings also point to the managerial implications on how managers may decide the product sets and replenishment frequency for improved benefit realization under CRP and VMI.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{benefits}} of sharing information in supply chains. The information used is transaction and forecast data, which are collected by the sharing party’s ERP systems. The research method used was literature review {{and the results of}} the thesis, building upon several academic articles and studies, suggest that information improves supply chain performance and decreases its costs. The motivation for information sharing and supply chain management (SCM) come from the ever-complicating and global business environment. Focus on core competencies has led to lengthy sup-ply chains and dependency on multiple suppliers. Subcontractors account for most of a product’s value nowadays, increasing the need for good supplier relations. Information sharing is a cooperation method, which also helps reduce supply chain costs too. Based on an empirical study, using information sharing alone can provide supply chain costs savings of 3, 3 to 9, 7 per cent. The thesis also presents value adding applications of information sharing, which can help reduce costs and improve performance even more. These applications include vendor managed inventory (VMI) and <b>continuous</b> <b>replenishment</b> <b>program</b> (CRP). In return for the benefits, deeper cooperation and absolute trust is required from the parties...|$|E
40|$|Supply chain {{collaboration}} programs, such as <b>continuous</b> <b>replenishment</b> <b>program</b> (CRP), {{is among}} the most popular supply chain management practices. CRP is an arrangement between two partners in a supply chain to share information on a regular basis for lowering logistics costs while maintaining or increasing service levels. CRP shifts the replenishment responsibility to the upstream partner to avoid the bullwhip effect across the supply chain. This dissertation aims to quantify, measure, and expand the benefits of CRP for the purpose of reducing logistics cost and improving customer service. The developed models in this dissertation are all applied in different case studies supported by a group of major healthcare partners. The first research contribution, discussed in chapter 2, is a comprehensive data-driven cost approximation model that quantifies the benefits of CRP for both partners under three cost components of inventory holding, transportation and ordering processing without imposing assumptions that normally do not hold in practice. The second contribution, discussed in chapter 3, is development of a verifiable efficiency measurement system to ensure the benefits of CRP for all partners. Multi-functional efficiency metrics are designed to capture the trade-off in gaining efficiency between multiple functions of logistics (i. e. inventory efficiency, transportation efficiency, and order processing efficiency). In addition, a statistical process control (SPC) system is developed to monitor the metrics over time. We discuss suitable SPC systems for various time series behaviors of the metrics. The third contribution of the dissertation, discussed in chapter 4, is development of a multi-objective decision analysis (MODA) model for multi-stop truckload (MSTL) planning. MSTL is becoming increasing popular among shippers while is experiencing significant resistance from carriers. MSTL is capable of reducing the shipping cost of shippers substantially but it can also disrupt carriers’ operations. A MODA model is developed for this problem to incorporate the key decision criteria of both sides for identifying the most desirable multi-stop routes from the perspective both decision makers...|$|E

40|$|O crescente interesse pela gestão da cadeia de suprimentos deve-se à percepção de que relacionamentos mais próximos promovem a melhoria do desempenho da cadeia como um todo. Isso é possível graças a, por exemplo, o aumento da visibilidade da demanda, proporcionado pela troca de informação entre os membros. A melhor sincronização entre a oferta e a demanda é uma das consequências da gestão colaborativa da cadeia de suprimentos, e as diferentes iniciativas de colaboração permitem a construção destas novas formas de relacionamento entre empresas que buscam a sua permanência em mercados cada vez mais dinâmicos e com clientes cada vez mais exigentes. Dentro desta temática, este trabalho analisou cinco iniciativas de colaboração por meio de revisão sistemática da {{literatura}}: Quick Response (QR), Efficient Consumer Response (ECR), <b>Continuous</b> <b>Replenishment</b> <b>Program</b> (CRP), Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) e Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR), com o objetivo de propor uma estrutura teórica para orientar o processo decisório de adoção e implementação dessas iniciativas colaborativas, com base nas características, nos benefícios esperados, nos motivadores à adoção e nas possíveis barreiras encontradas em cada uma delas. Após análise dos benefícios mencionados na literatura, estes foram classificados em primários e secundários, sendo que os benefícios primários devem ser alcançados para que os benefícios secundários apareçam. As barreiras encontradas na literatura foram divididas em culturais, comportamentais e físicas. Com o desenvolvimento da tecnologia, uma barreira física, os aspectos culturais e comportamentais passam a ter uma influencia negativa maior no relacionamento. Os motivadores à adoção da iniciativa podem estar relacionados às mudanças econômicas ou de mercado, ou à forma de organização das empresas. Analisando o contexto de criação e desenvolvimento dessas iniciativas, bem como suas características, foi possível propor um framework para caracterização das mesmas que pode servir como um guia para as empresas que desejam implementá-las ou auxiliar as que já adotam a analisarem seu estado atual e projetar seu futuro. Finalmente, foi proposta uma estrutura teórica para auxiliar o processo decisório de adoção de iniciativas colaborativas, unindo os principais resultados deste estudo, mostrando ao tomador de decisão os principais aspectos que devem ser analisados para a adoção de uma iniciativa de colaboração e evidenciando a necessidade de monitoramento constante do desempenho da iniciativa. The {{growing interest}} in supply chain management is due to perception that closer relationship between partners lead to performance improvement of the supply chain as a whole. This is possible, for example, due to the increase of demand visibility provided by information exchange between its members. Better supply and demand synchronization {{is a consequence of}} collaborative supply chain management and the adoption of collaborative initiatives helps to build these new collaborative relationships between companies that are seeking to remain competitive in dynamic markets, with more demand from customers. Within this theme, this master thesis analysed five collaborative initiatives through systematic literature review, including Quick Response (QR), Efficient Consumer Response (ECR), <b>Continuous</b> <b>Replenishment</b> <b>Program</b> (CRP), Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) and Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR), aiming to develop a theoretical framework to guide the decision making process of adopting and implementing these collaborative initiatives, based on the characteristics, expected benefits, reasons for adopting and possible barriers found in each of them. The analysis of benefits cited in literature showed primary and secondary benefits that are reached by these initiatives. Primary benefits, like better inventory management, should be reached before secondary benefits, like cost reduction, appear. The barriers found in literature were grouped in cultural, behavioral and physical. With technology development, a physical barrier, cultural and behavioral barriers influence more negatively on the relationship than do the physical ones. The reasons for adopting found in literature can be related to economic or market changes in the environment that the supply chain operates, or the form of business organization. Analysing the context of creation and development of these initiatives and their characteristics, it was possible to propose a framework for characterizing the initiatives. It is made of several dimensions for differentiating one initiative from another and {{can be used as a}} guide for companies that are planning to implement these initiatives, or help the ones that have already adopted to review its current state and to design a future one. Finally, the theoretical framework to guide the decision making process of adopting a collaborative initiative was proposed, linking the main results of this work, showing to the decision maker the main aspects of concern when adopting a collaborative initiative and highlighting the need to monitor the initiatives performance constantly...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} number of natural disasters that led to catastrophic damage to mankind. China is one of the countries most affected by natural disasters in the world. Although logistics activities account for a large percentage of total operations in aftermath relief, they have frequently not been recognized as key levers for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of humanitarian organizations and as being crucial to operational excellence. Meanwhile, due to the large number of relief actors involved in the Chinese context, the coordination among various players becomes a very prominent challenge to cope with. Therefore, this master study aims to explore how to improve the coordination among actors in the Chinese relief chain context. This research consists of theoretical and empirical parts. In the theoretical party, this thesis explores the prospects of transferring lessons learnt from the commercial supply chain to the relief chain by finding out the existing coordination mechanisms in the commercial logistics operations. Some coordination mechanisms- i. e. Joint Procurement, Quick Response, <b>Continuous</b> <b>Replenishment</b> <b>Program,</b> Vendor Managed Inventory, Joint Managed Inventory, Continuous Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment and 3 rd party logistics are the practiced coordination mechanisms in procurement, inventory and transportation processes together with corresponding characteristics and requirements to adopt them. Besides specific coordination mechanisms, generic lessons learnt from the commercial supply chain are also abstracted. They are Resource Sharing, Joint Decision Making and Outsourcing, which can be performed on strategic, tactical or operational levels based on the orientations of relationships among coordinating alliance. These experiences from the commercial supply chain come as a foreground for relief actors to step on. Although the objective of the relief chain and commercial supply chain remains the same i. e. delivering right amount of materials to the right places, some factors existing after major disasters distinguish the relief chain from the commercial supply chain fundamentally. These factors are 1) Urgency 2) Uncertainty 3) Complexity of operation conditions 4) Co-existence of various actors. Due to the existence of these challenging factors in disaster aftermath, the current practicing coordination mechanisms in the commercial supply chain can’t be transferred directly into the relief chain. As the application level for these coordination mechanisms are evaluated respectively in this thesis, it turns out Joint Procurement, Quick Response and 3 rd party logistics are those promising mechanisms {{with a high level of}} application prospect in the relief chain. Meanwhile, the generic lessons from the commercial supply chain still hold in the relief chain and especially when they are put in practice operationally or tactically among organizations. The theoretical study provides the research a direction to further explore the reality. The Wenchuan earthquake case study is conducted to test the prospects of these coordination methods in Chinese context. Through this case study, all the specific promising coordination mechanisms are found with some changes adapted to specific situations. Some coordination initiatives that reflect the generic approaches (Resource Sharing) in commercial chain are also discovered i. e. demand information sharing and inventory capacity sharing. Meanwhile, some new coordination initiatives are invented uniquely by relief actors. They are coordination to have a complementary supply effect and coordination for the sake of legal operation. In order to better involve actors in the relief chain, the following recommendations are offered to humanitarian organizations during the preparation phase 1) Non-governmental can be incorporated into existing relief system to achieve an overall complemented effect to governmental relief 2) Build up sustainable relations with suppliers on emergency supply 3) NGOs Identify strategic alliance before emergency. During response phase, it is advisable for NGOs to 1) Spot their position in less attention areas to avoid media’s framing effect 2) Coordination by standing by when information is unclear.

40|$|The Toll-like {{receptor}} (TLR) 4 receptor complex, TLR 4 /MD- 2, {{plays an}} important role in the inflammatory response against lipopolysaccharide, a ubiquitous membrane component in Gram-negative bacteria. Ligand recognition by TLR 4 initiates multiple intracellular signaling pathways, leading to production of proinflammatory mediators and type I IFN. Ligand interaction also leads to internalization of the surface receptor complex into lysosomes, leading to the degradation of TLR 4 and the termination of LPS response. However, surface level of TLR 4 receptor complex is maintained via <b>continuous</b> <b>replenishment</b> of TLR 4 from intracellular compartments like Golgi and endosomes. Here we show that <b>continuous</b> <b>replenishment</b> of TLR 4 from Golgi to plasma membrane is regulated by the small GTPase Rab 10, which is essential for optimal macrophage activation following LPS stimulation. Expression of Rab 10 is inducible by LPS. Blockade of Rab 10 function leads to decreased membrane TLR 4 expression and diminished production of inflammatory cytokines and interferons upon LPS stimulation. These findings suggest that Rab 10 expression provides a mechanism to refine TLR 4 signaling by regulating the trafficking rate of TLR 4 onto the plasma membrane. In addition, we show that altered Rab 10 expression in macrophages influences disease severity in an in vivo model of LPS-induced acute lung injury, suggesting Rab 10 as a possible therapeutic target for human acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ...|$|R
