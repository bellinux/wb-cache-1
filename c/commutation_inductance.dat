40|$|This paper {{presents}} a charge-based Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) modulation {{strategy for the}} 3 Level – 5 Level (3 – 5 L) Dual Active Bridge (DAB) DC–DC converter. The DAB combines a primary-side full bridge and a secondaryside mixed bridge (i. e. a 3 -level T-type leg with a half-bridge leg), linked by a high-frequency transformer and an inductor. A ZVS modulation strategy is presented, in which a charge-based model of the non-linear parasitic output capacitances of the switches is used to accurately describe the ZVS constraints. Moreover, <b>commutation</b> <b>inductances</b> are included to extend the ZVS region to the entire operating range. The configuration of the secondary-side bridge facilitates increased flexibility compared to a full bridge configuration, {{in order to reduce}} the RMS current in the switches, inductor, and transformer.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{procedure for}} the derivation of optimal, full-operating-range zero voltage switching (ZVS) modulation schemes for single-phase, single-stage, bidirectional and isolated dual active bridge (DAB) ac-dc converters is presented. The converter topology {{consists of a}} DAB dc-dc converter, receiving a rectified ac line voltage via a synchronous rectifier. The DAB comprises primary and secondary side full bridges, linked by a high-frequency isolation transformer and a series inductor. ZVS modulation schemes previously proposed in the literature are either based on current-based or energy-based ZVS analyses. The procedure outlined in this paper for the calculation of optimal DAB modulation schemes (i. e., combined phase-shift, duty-cycle, and switching frequency modulation) relies on a novel, more accurate, current-dependent charge-based ZVS analysis, {{taking into account the}} amount of charge that is required to charge the nonlinear parasitic output capacitances of the switches during commutation. Thereby, the concept of 2 ̆ 2 <b>commutation</b> <b>inductance(s)</b> 2 ̆ 2 is shown to be an essential element in achieving full-operating-range ZVS.

40|$|Dual Active Bridge (DAB) {{converters}} {{offer an}} unmatched capability to transfer energy {{in either direction}} between two DC sources, especially when they are operated under Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) conditions. However, the parasitic <b>commutation</b> <b>inductance</b> within the bridge phase leg devices can still lead to significant energy losses at device turn-off despite operating under ZVS conditions. These losses can become significant when one bridge has a low DC bus voltage and a consequential high magnitude output current. This paper shows how harmonic decomposition analysis {{can be used to}} constrain the bridge circulating currents to their minimum possible values at the point of phase leg commutation while still ensuring that ZVS operation is maintained. This can be used to improve the overall DAB performance under low voltage, high current operating conditions of one DC port. The capability of the theoretical analysis process is confirmed by matching experimental results for a reference DAB system...|$|E

The overall approach allows for taking advantage of the degrees of freedom offered by silicon and PCB technologies with a limited and well-mastered complexity. The multiphase converter is integrated within three multi-terminal chips that are judiciously packaged, using the partial flip-chip, on a PCB board so as to reduce the switching cell stray inductance as well as the impact of voltage variations on the common mode current that flows through the converter's PCB. Using Si and SiC dipole MOSFET and diode chips, converters based on the 3 -chip approach were realized and compared to the conventional one.

This paper de-scribes a drive inverter that is deeply integrated into the electric motor, {{as well as the}} innovative modular power electronics concepts that are substantial for creating more compact and more cost effective electric power trains. The central components of the presented approach towards higher integration are so-called Smart Stator Teeth (SST). The SST concept blurs the borders between the inverter and the motor by connecting each individual stator winding with its own electronic module. Thus, the current in every tooth can be optimally controlled with respect to efficiency, independently from the other teeth. Furthermore, research is done on the construction of a novel power module based on SiC semiconductor de-vices. In this concept, the semiconductors are directly bonded onto copper busbars by silver sintering.
