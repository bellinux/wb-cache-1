40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} aimed at the {{influence}} of the linear non uniformity of pollution layer on critical current Icri and <b>critical</b> flashover <b>voltage</b> Vcri of polluted insulator under lightning impulse voltage. It is shown that the experimental values of Icri and Vcri of uniformly and non-uniformly polluted insulator depends on the configuration of pollution and the polarity of voltage. A mathematical model enabling to compute the flashover discharge characteristic constants (n and N) and the critical thickness of pollution layer and thence the critical characteristics of flashover (current and voltage) is presented. It's also shown that n and N are not static and they depend on the parameters of the equivalent electrical circuit, thermal characteristics of discharge and the condition of propagation. The computed <b>critical</b> <b>voltages</b> are found in a good accordance with the experimental ones while the computed critical currents are higher than the experimental ones. The recalculated critical currents and <b>critical</b> <b>voltages</b> assuming that only a part of the thickness of pollution layer contributes to the conduction phenomena at the interface between the discharge and electrolyte well match to the experimental values.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of {{experiments}} on electrically driven convection that occurs in a thin, freely suspended film of smectic A liquid crystal when an electric field is applied in {{the plane of the}} film. Convection in a vortex pattern is found above a well-defined <b>critical</b> <b>voltage.</b> The film behaves as a two-dimensional isotropic liquid: neither its thickness nor the director field are modified by the flow. We present measurements of the <b>critical</b> <b>voltage</b> at the onset of convection in two experimental configurations [...] one which allows the injection of charges into the film from the electrodes, and one which does not. When injection is present, the <b>critical</b> <b>voltage</b> for the onset of flow increases monotonically with increasing frequency of applied field.
