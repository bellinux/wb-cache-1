60|$|In the midst, there fell on {{her ears}} a low strain of melancholy music {{rising and falling}} like the wailing of mournful spirits. She sprang {{to her feet and}} stood {{listening}} with dilated eyes; then, as a louder note reached her, in terror uncontrollable, she caught up her <b>candle,</b> <b>rushed</b> down the stairs like a wild bird, and stood panting before Mrs. Aylward, who had a big Bible open on the table before her.|$|R
60|$|And how simple, how weak, how {{unlike any}} Thing of an Angelick Nature, {{was it to}} attempt to save the poor Wretch, only by little Noises and sham Appearances, putting out the <b>Candles,</b> <b>rushing</b> and josteling in the Dark, and the like! If the Devil was that mighty Seraph, which we have heard of, {{if he is a}} God of this World, a Prince of the Air, a Spirit able to destroy Cities and make Havock in the World; if he can raise Tempests and Storms, throw Fire about the World, and do {{wonderful}} Things, as an unchain'd Devil no Doubt could do; what need all this Frippery? and what need he try so many ridiculous Ways, by the Emptiness, nay, the silly nonsensical Manner, of which, he shews, that he is able to do no better, and that his Power is extinguish'd? In a Word, he would certainly act otherwise, if he could. Sed caret pedibus, he wants Power.|$|R
60|$|Everything was at sixes and sevens. But a {{fire was}} made in the kitchen, the hearth-rug put down, the kettle set on the hob, and Mrs. Brangwen began towards sunset to prepare the first meal. Ursula and Gudrun were slaving in the bedrooms, <b>candles</b> were <b>rushing</b> about. Then from the kitchen came the smell of ham and eggs and coffee, and in the gaslight, the {{scrambled}} meal began. The family seemed to huddle together like a little camp in a strange place. Ursula felt a load of responsibility upon her, caring for the half-little ones. The smallest kept near the mother.|$|R
5000|$|... "They went to Long Point, {{arriving}} {{just enough}} before dark {{to locate the}} spot where the treasure was. Then they waited until exactly midnight, and then started a procession, Deacon Troyer holding the open Bible before him, and his son following with a lighted candle, with spades, picks, etc. They dug down, and presently the pick struck metal. They got the pick under the lid of the box and pried it up. And then, at that moment a black shape rose up and assumed the form of a black dog, growing bigger and bigger, and they dropped the Bible and <b>candle</b> and <b>rushed</b> for the canoe, and never had any curiosity to return to the spot." ...|$|R
60|$|So Rose began, and, wakeful as Lucy was, {{she found}} the low sweet tones lulled her a little. But {{she did not like}} this; she had a perverse {{intention}} of staying awake till Rose got into bed, so instead of attending to the holy words, she pinched herself, and pulled herself, and kept her eyes staring open, gazing at the flickering shadows cast by the dim home-made <b>rush</b> <b>candle.</b>|$|R
60|$|The two {{men did not}} {{recognize}} each other, for they had only met for a moment, and that by the faint light of a <b>rush</b> <b>candle.</b> Plume, therefore, {{had no idea of}} giving up his place or his duty to a man whom he conceived was a stranger; and Henri was at a loss to conceive who could be the singular looking creature that seemed to take so tender an interest in his friend.|$|R
60|$|This was not bad news, {{and they}} all entered the hut, where the fire was made up, and one of Patience's <b>rush</b> <b>candles</b> placed {{on the table with}} a kind of screen of plaited rushes to protect it from the worst of the draught. Jeph had grown quite into a man in the eyes of his {{brothers}} and sisters. He looked plump and well fed, and his clothes were good and fresh, and his armour bright, a contrast to Steadfast's smock, stained with weather and soil, and his rough leathern leggings, although Patience did her best, and his shirt was scrupulously clean every Sunday morning.|$|R
60|$|Grisell and Thora {{did their}} utmost, but without {{reviving}} her, and they watched by her, hardly conscious of anything else, {{as they tried}} their simple, ineffective remedies one after another, with no thought or possibility of sending for further help, since the roads would be impassable in the long January night, and besides, the Lancastrians might make them doubly perilous. Moreover, this dumb paralysis was accepted as past cure, and needing not the doctor but the priest. Before the first streak of dawn on that tardy, northern morning, Ridley's ponderous step came up the stair, into the feeble light of the <b>rush</b> <b>candle</b> which the watchers tried to shelter from the draughts.|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps the constable was right. It {{is better}} doubtless to believe much unreason {{and a little}} truth than to deny for denial's sake truth and unreason alike, for when we do this we have not even a <b>rush</b> <b>candle</b> to guide our steps, not even a poor sowlth to dance before us on the marsh, and must needs fumble our way into the great {{emptiness}} where dwell the mis-shapen dhouls. And after all, can we come to so great evil if we keep a little fire on our hearths and in our souls, and welcome with open hand whatever of excellent come to warm itself, whether it be man or phantom, and do not say too fiercely, even to the dhouls themselves, [...] "Be ye gone"? When {{all is said and}} done, how do we not know but that our own unreason may be better than another's truth? for it has been warmed on our hearths and in our souls, and is ready for the wild bees of truth to hive in it, and make their sweet honey. Come into the world again, wild bees, wild bees! ...|$|R
60|$|The precincts of {{the gloomy}} and ruinous hut were enlightened partly by some furze which blazed on the hearth, the smoke whereof, having no legal vent, eddied around, and formed {{over the heads}} of the {{assembled}} council a clouded canopy, as opake as their metaphysical theology, through which, like stars through mist, were dimly seen to twinkle a few blinking <b>candles,</b> or rather <b>rushes</b> dipped in tallow, the property of the poor owner of the cottage, which were stuck to the walls by patches of wet clay. This broken and dusky light showed many a countenance elated with spiritual pride, or rendered dark by fierce enthusiasm; and some whose anxious, wandering, and uncertain looks, showed they felt themselves rashly embarked in a cause which they had neither courage nor conduct to bring to a good issue, yet knew not how to abandon, for very shame. They were, indeed, a doubtful and disunited body. The most active of their number were those concerned with Burley in the death of the Primate, four or five of whom had found their way to Loudon-hill, together with other men of the same relentless and uncompromising zeal, who had, in various ways, given desperate and unpardonable offence to the government.|$|R

60|$|His guide then motioned him {{to follow}} him. For some time it seemed to Harry that he was {{retracing}} his steps. Then they turned, and by what seemed a long detour, at last reached firmer ground. A minute or two later they were walking along a path, and presently stopped before {{the door of a}} cabin, by which two men were standing. They exchanged a word or two with the boy, and then motioned to Harry to enter. A peat fire Was burning on the hearth, and a woman, whose age Harry from her aspect thought must be enormous, was crouched on a low stool beside it. He threw off his riding cloak and knelt by her, and held his hands over the fire to restore the circulation. One of the men lighted a <b>candle</b> formed of <b>rushes</b> dipped in tallow. Harry paid no heed to them until he felt the warmth returning to his limbs. Then he rose to his feet and addressed them in English. They shook their heads. Perceiving how wet he was one of them drew a bottle from under the thatch, and pouring some of its contents into a wooden cup offered it to him. Harry put it to his lips. At first it seemed that he was drinking a mixture of liquid fire and smoke, and the first swallow nearly choked him. However he persevered, and soon felt the blood coursing more rapidly in his veins. Finding the impossibilty of conversing, he again sat down by the fire and waited the course of events. He had observed that as he entered his young guide had, in obedience probably to the orders of one of the men, darted away into the mist.|$|R
