25|$|Lack of {{behavior}} change: Some communities have toilets, yet people prefer to defecate in the open. In some cases, these toilets {{are provided by}} the government or other organizations and the people do not like them, or do not value them. They continue to defecate in the open. Also, older people are often found to defecate in the open and they are hesitant to <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> and go inside a closed toilet.|$|E

25|$|As in vertebrates, {{there are}} many species of {{invertebrates}} which actively pursue prey in groups and exhibit task specialization, but while the vertebrates <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> based on their role in hunting, invertebrate task delegation is usually based on actual morphological differences. The vast majority of eusocial insects have castes within a population which tend to differ in size and have specialized structures for different tasks. This differentiation is taken to the extreme in the groups isoptera and hymenoptera, or termites and ants, bees, and wasps respectively.|$|E
25|$|One {{explanation}} is that social-media users usually split their time between Facebook and interacting in the real world. When something entertaining happens in real life, people {{feel the need to}} share it. It might seem harmless, however at some point people begin to substitute one reality with another. As a result, people start to <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> and even their assumptions about life, love and friendships, based on the Facebook reality. This leads to cognitive dissonance. Such a discrepancy between perceptions and beliefs can damage people's emotional balance and lead them to experience identity confusion, relationship conflicts, changes in judgement, and even psychotic break.|$|E
25|$|The {{term was}} coined by Joel Kovel to {{describe}} the subtle racial behaviors of any ethnic or racial group who rationalize their aversion to a particular group by appeal to rules or stereotypes. People who behave in an aversively racial way may profess egalitarian beliefs, and will often deny their racially motivated behavior; nevertheless they <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> when dealing {{with a member of}} another race or ethnic group than the one they belong to. The motivation for the change is thought to be implicit or subconscious. Experiments have provided empirical support for the existence of aversive racism. Aversive racism has been shown to have potentially serious implications for decision making in employment, in legal decisions and in helping behavior.|$|E

25|$|In this study, {{participants}} {{were assigned to}} one of two conditions. In the first condition they would be paired with a computer and would become the blue team. The computer had a blue sticker and the human wore a blue wristband to signify that they were in fact a team. The second condition was blue individual, in which a person would use a computer but they were not considered teammates, rather the computer was just a resource. The task was to complete a “Desert Survival Guide” activity in which participants rank items they deem most important if they were left on a deserted island. Human participants initially completed the activity on their own and then completed it using a computer (either as a teammate where both the computer and human were evaluated or just using the computer as a resource). Finally, the {{participants were}} allowed to revise their rankings, if they wished to do so. The results of this study indicated that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate viewed the computer as more like them, worked in a similar style to their own, was more cooperative and friendlier than people who worked individually. Another finding of this study showed that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate were more likely to <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> and conform to the group ideal even when the teammate was a computer. This study supports the notion that developing a sense of interdependency is the key to establishing team affiliation.|$|E
500|$|As waves {{approach}} {{land and}} move into shallow water, they <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior.</b> If approaching at an angle, waves may bend (refraction) or wrap rocks and headlands (diffraction). When the wave reaches a point where its deepest oscillations of the water contact the seabed, they begin to slow down. This pulls the crests closer together and increases the waves' height, which is called wave shoaling. When {{the ratio of the}} wave's height to the water depth increases above a certain limit, it [...] "breaks", toppling over in a mass of foaming water. This rushes in a sheet up the beach before retreating into the sea under the influence of gravity.|$|E

2500|$|Laffer {{explains}} {{the model in}} terms of two interacting effects of taxation: an [...] "arithmetic effect" [...] and an [...] "economic effect". The [...] "arithmetic effect" [...] assumes that tax revenue raised is the tax rate multiplied by the revenue available for taxation (or tax base). Thus revenue R is equal to t×B where t is the tax rate and B is the taxable base (R=t×B). At a 0% tax rate, the model assumes that no tax revenue is raised. The [...] "economic effect" [...] assumes that the tax rate will affect the tax base itself. At the extreme of a 100% tax rate, the government theoretically collects zero revenue because taxpayers <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> {{in response to the}} tax rate: either they lose their incentive to work, or they find a way to avoid paying taxes. Thus, the [...] "economic effect" [...] of a 100% tax rate is to decrease the tax base to zero. If this is the case, then somewhere between 0% and 100% lies a tax rate that will maximize revenue.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{cognitive}} {{responses in}} the young stages of infidelity are incompetence and resentfulness. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity, the feeling of incompetence can lead to cognitive resentment. The partner being cheated on will begin to feel that anything and everything they do is not enough to keep their unfaithful partner from straying which in turn makes them feel incompetent. They may feel incompetent in the ways of love, affection, or sex. Whenever an individual suspects that they are being cheated on they try to <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> in hopes of keeping or getting their partner’s attention back onto themselves instead of on the person whom they are having another relationship with (Johnson, 2017). People cheat for many reasons and each of those can cause a faithful person to believe they are not competent enough to be in a romantic relationship. This feeling leads to the resentment of the unfaithful partner’s actions and becomes an ongoing emotion throughout the stages of infidelity instead of simply being a quick and immediate response to a partner’s actions. The accuser begins to anticipate feeling rejected by their significant other, therefore, they have resentful cognitive responses towards the accused.|$|E

5000|$|... "Flooding" [...] is an {{effective}} form of treatment for phobias amongst other psychopathologies. It works {{on the principles of}} classical conditioning or respondent conditioning—a form of Pavlov's classical conditioning—where patients <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>behaviors</b> to avoid negative stimuli. According to Pavlov, people learn through associations, so if one has a phobia, it is because one associates the feared stimulus with a negative outcome.|$|R
2500|$|Also, {{behavioral}} {{therapy and}} psychological therapy are suggested treatments to reduce chronic headaches. Behavioral therapy and psychological therapy relate closely in their treatment methods, {{which include a}} combination of identifying headache stressors, biofeedback, relaxation training, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapy's purpose [...] "is to identify and resolve the sources of recurrent stress". In treatment studies, patients with medication plus cognitive-behavioral therapy groups did better than groups with medication alone or cognitive-behavioral therapy alone. Psychological and behavioral therapies identify stressful situations and teach chronic headache patients to react differently, <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior,</b> or adjust attitudes to reduce tension that leads to headaches. Treatments especially focus on [...] "emotional, mental, behavioral, and social factors" [...] as they impact headaches. Patients are advised to simply avoid stressors when plausible or share their burdens with others. In this way, {{studies have found that}} patients with multimodal treatment in a group setting fare better than patients who follow multimodal treatment alone. Another behavioral study, which included multimodal treatment, showed that the [...] "frequency of severe headaches was reduced by a clinically significant amount for 75% of the patients". Behavioral and psychological therapies work to identify and eliminate or reduce stressful situations that lead to chronic headaches.|$|E
2500|$|A three-person defence {{team was}} hired by the Pakistani embassy to {{supplement}} her two existing public defenders, but Siddiqui refused to co-operate with them.

60|$|The {{main point}} to grasp {{here is that}} {{families}} are not kept together at present by family feeling but by human feeling. The family cultivates sympathy and mutual help and consolation as {{any other form of}} kindly association cultivates them; but the addition of a dictated compulsory affection as an attribute of near kinship is not only unnecessary, but positively detrimental; and the alleged tendency of modern social development to break up the family need alarm nobody. We cannot break up the facts of kinship nor eradicate its natural emotional consequences. What we can do and ought to do is to set people free to behave naturally and to <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> as circumstances change. To impose on a citizen of London the family duties of a Highland cateran in the eighteenth century is as absurd as to compel him to carry a claymore and target instead of an umbrella. The civilized man has no special use for cousins; and he may presently find that he has no special use for brothers and sisters. The parent seems likely to remain indispensable; but {{there is no reason why}} that natural tie should be made the excuse for unnatural aggravations of it, as crushing to the parent as they are oppressive to the child. The mother and father will not always have to shoulder the burthen of maintenance which should fall on the Atlas shoulders of the fatherland and motherland. Pending such reforms and emancipations, a shattering break-up of the parental home must remain one of the normal incidents of marriage. The parent is left lonely and the child is not. Woe to the old if they have no impersonal interests, no convictions, no public causes to advance, no tastes or hobbies! It is well to be a mother but not to be a mother-in-law; and if men were cut off artificially from intellectual and public interests as women are, the father-in-law would be as deplorable a figure in popular tradition as the mother-in-law.|$|E
