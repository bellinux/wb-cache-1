Decisions to purchase technology for education are very often political decisions. Most staff using these technologies did not grow up with them. Training teachers to use computer technology did improve their confidence in its use, but there was considerable dissatisfaction with training content and style of delivery. The <b>communication</b> <b>element,</b> in particular, was highlighted as the least satisfactory part of the training, by which many teachers meant {{the use of a}} VLE and discussion forums to deliver online training (Leask 2002). Technical support for online learning, lack of access to hardware, poor monitoring of teacher progress and a lack of support by online tutors were just some of the issues raised by the asynchronous online delivery of training (Davies 2004).|$|E

40|$|Modern {{integrated}} circuits are often multi-core designs connected via <b>communication</b> <b>elements</b> like buses, bridges, and routers.

When a system interacts cyber-physically with the real world via sensors and actuators guaranteeing that the communication meets certain latency requirements and thus ensuring sufficient throughput is crucial.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Effective {{communication}} with patients impacts clinical outcome and patient satisfaction. We measure {{the rate at}} which medical students use six targeted <b>communication</b> <b>elements</b> with patients and association of element use with patient satisfaction. METHODS: Participants included fourth year medical students enrolled in an emergency medicine clerkship. A trained observer measured use of six communication elements: acknowledging the patient by name, introducing themselves by name, identifying their role, explaining the care plan, explaining that multiple providers would see the patient, and providing an estimated duration of time in the emergency department. The observer then conducted a survey of patient satisfaction with the medical student encounter. RESULTS: A total of 246 encounters were documented among forty medical student participants. For the six <b>communication</b> <b>elements</b> evaluated, in 61 % of encounters medical students acknowledged the patient, in 91 % they introduced themselves, in 58 % they identified their role as a student, in 64 % they explained the care plan, in 80 % they explained that another provider would see the patient, and in only 6 % they provided an estimated duration of care. Only 1 encounter (0. 4 %) contained all six elements. Patients' likelihood to refer a loved one to that ED was increased when students acknowledged the patient and described that other providers would be involved in patient care (P[*]=[*] 0. 016 and 0. 015 respectively, Chi Square). Likewise, patients' likelihood to return to the ED was increased when students described their role in patient care (P[*]=[*] 0. 035, Chi Square). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that medical students infrequently use all targeted <b>communication</b> <b>elements.</b> When they did use certain elements, patient satisfaction increased. These data imply potential benefit to additional training for students in patient communication...|$|R
