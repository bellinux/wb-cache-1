5|$|On June 5, 1986, {{the couple}} was living in Auburn, Washington when Bruce Nickell, 52, <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> with a headache. According to Stella, Nickell took four Extra-Strength Excedrin {{capsules}} from a bottle in their home for his headache and collapsed minutes later. Nickell died shortly thereafter at Harborview Medical Center, where treatment had failed to revive him. His death was initially ruled to be by natural causes, with attending physicians citing emphysema.|$|E
2500|$|That {{was my last}} {{really good}} day. It wasn’t until I <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> that I knew the truth… Gina was still lying in the same position… Katrin was still quiet.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1943, a {{few months}} after Streisand's first birthday, her father died {{suddenly}} at age 34 from complications from an epileptic seizure, possibly the result of a head injury years earlier. The family fell into near-poverty, with her mother working as a low-paid bookkeeper. As an adult, Streisand remembered those early years as always feeling like an [...] "outcast," [...] explaining, [...] "Everybody else's father <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> {{at the end of the}} day. Mine didn't." [...] Her mother tried to pay their bills but could not give her daughter the attention she craved: [...] "When I wanted love from my mother, she gave me food," [...] Streisand says.|$|E

60|$|Not {{many words}} were spoken. Paul almost hated his mother for {{suffering}} {{because his father}} did not <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will speak}} to my father about it this evening when he <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> You are quite sure that I shall not have to undress at all?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next evening}} when Billy <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> Saxon {{caused him to}} know and {{undertake}} more of the responsibilities of fatherhood.|$|E
6000|$|The father <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> {{at about}} four o'clock. He dragged silently {{into the house}} and sat down. Minnie bustled to give him his dinner. Tired, he laid his black arms on the table. There were swede turnips for his dinner, which he liked. Paul {{wondered}} if he knew. It was some time, and nobody had spoken. At last the son said: ...|$|E
60|$|It was in {{the late}} spring that he <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> one night aware of unusual tiredness. There was a keen {{expectancy}} {{in the air as}} he sat down to the table, but he did not notice. He went through the meal in moody silence, mechanically eating what was before him. The children um'd and ah'd and made smacking noises with their mouths. But he was deaf to them.|$|E
50|$|Ringo <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> as Nancy {{goes out}} to her job, and they share breakfast before she leaves. They {{establish}} a good relationship that develops into a good friendship.|$|R
50|$|J. Henry Waugh is an accountant, albeit {{an unhappy}} one. However, each night after he <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> Henry immerses {{himself in a}} world of his choosing: a {{baseball}} league in which every action is ruled by the dice.|$|R
50|$|Dead Funny is a 1994 {{independent}} drama film {{directed by}} John Feldman. It stars Elizabeth Peña as Vivian Saunders, {{a woman who}} <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> and finds her boyfriend Reggie Barker (Andrew McCarthy) pinned to her kitchen table with a long knife.|$|R
60|$|The {{behavior}} of Miss Evans {{was so much}} better next day that it really seemed as though her father's diagnosis was correct. At dinner, when the men <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> she piled Mr. Carter's plate up so generously that her father and brother had ample time at their disposal to watch him eat. And when {{he put his hand}} over his glass she poured half a pint of good beer, that other men would have been thankful for, up his sleeve.|$|E
60|$|He {{went home}} to bed: and dreamed a strange dream. He dreamed {{that he was in}} a country with which he was not acquainted. Night was coming on, and he had nowhere to sleep. So he passed the mouth of a sort of cave or house, in which a woman, an old woman, sat. Therefore he entered, and though he could not {{understand}} the language, still his second self understood. The cave was a house: and men <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> His second self assumed that they were tin-miners.|$|E
60|$|We all knew, of course, that Uncle William is the {{greatest}} artist in the world, but no one liked {{to suggest that he}} should sell his pictures for money, a thing that no prince was ever capable of doing. Yet I could not but feel glad when Uncle decided yesterday that he would stoop to make his living by art. It cost him a great struggle to make this decision, but he talked it over very fully last night with Uncle Henry, after Uncle Henry <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> and the resolution is taken.|$|E
6000|$|... "Make {{him stop}} drinking," [...] he prayed every night. [...] "Lord, let my father die," [...] he prayed very often. [...] "Let him not be killed at pit," [...] he prayed when, after tea, the {{father did not}} <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R
25|$|Full-day {{classes are}} the {{extension}} of already present 'extended stay' (produženi boravak), which allows students to stay at school after the morning shift (typically ending at noon) until their parents <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> (typically 3-5 pm). Schools offering full-day classes also offer 'extended stay'.|$|R
50|$|In current usage, {{the name}} envisions a {{scenario}} where an angry or frustrated employee <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> {{looking for some}} way to take out his anger, {{but the only thing}} present is the cat. He physically abuses it as a means of relieving his frustration, despite the cat playing no part in causing it.|$|R
60|$|After that, every afternoon, as Jack <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> {{the girl}} would {{meet him in}} a quiet corner off the general line, and for five minutes he would teach her, not hearing her say what she had learned, but telling her fresh sounds and {{combinations}} of letters. Five or six times he would go over them, and expected--for Jack was tyrannical in his ways--that she would carry them away with her and learn them by heart, and go through them again and again, {{so that when he}} questioned her during their longer talks she would be perfect.|$|E
60|$|Billy {{could never}} get over the shock, during that period, of Saxon's appearance. Morning after morning, and evening after evening when he <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> he would enter the room where she lay and fight a royal battle to hide his {{feelings}} and make a show of cheerfulness and geniality. She looked so small lying there so small and shrunken and weary, and yet so child-like in her smallness. Tenderly, as he sat beside her, he would take up her pale hand and stroke the slim, transparent arm, marveling at the smallness and delicacy of the bones.|$|E
60|$|Little Boy Blue was {{now very}} happy, {{and his mother}} was proud and {{contented}} and began to improve in health. After a few weeks she became strong enough to leave the cottage and walk a little in the fields each day; but she could not go far, because her limbs were too feeble to support her long, so the most she could attempt was to walk as far as the stile to meet Little Boy Blue as he <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> in the evening. Then she would lean on his shoulder and return to the cottage with him, and the boy was very glad he could thus support his darling mother and assist her faltering steps.|$|E
50|$|A man <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> to his {{seemingly}} luxurious apartment building. Having {{to share}} the elevator with two other tenants seems to make him uncomfortable. When an old lady is dying in the hallway, {{no one can be}} bothered to go out and help her. Except the concierge; a hologram that cannot do anything to help her.|$|R
50|$|The song {{is about}} a woman who waits at home all day for her man to <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> The music video was filmed on the Bluebell Railway, a {{heritage}} line running between East and West Sussex in England. The video stars London and South Western Railway No. 488, a preserved LSWR 0415 Class locomotive.|$|R
5000|$|Laura Newman: Laura is Adam's {{wife and}} {{works at a}} bookstore. She is Adam's {{salvation}} each day when she <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> to take the kids off his hands. She is astonished at how addicted he is to channel surfing and coffee shop fare. [...] "one espresso addict in the family is expensive enough," [...] she warns Clayton.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} spindle-supported porch before Honora's front door, and had she chosen she might have {{followed}} the example of her neighbours and {{sat there in the}} evenings. She preferred to watch the life about her from the window-seat in the little parlour. The word exile suggests, perhaps, to those who have never tried it, empty wastes, isolation, loneliness. She had been prepared for these things, and Wylie Street was a shock to her: in sending her there at this crisis in her life fate had perpetrated nothing less than a huge practical joke. Next door, for instance, in the twin house to hers, flaunted in the face of liberal divorce laws, was a young couple with five children. Honora counted them, from the eldest ones that ran over her little grass plot on their way to and from the public school, to the youngest that spent much of his time gazing skyward from a perambulator on the sidewalk. Six days of the week, about six o'clock in the evening, there was a celebration in the family. Father <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work!</b> He was a smooth-faced young man whom a fortnight in the woods might have helped wonderfully--a clerk in the big department store.|$|E
5000|$|The 1972 song by John Prine, [...] "The Frying Pan," [...] {{from his}} album Diamonds in the Rough, {{begins with the}} line, [...] "I <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> this evening, {{there was a note}} in the frying pan, it said cook your own supper babe, I've run off with the Fuller Brush Man." ...|$|E
50|$|When her {{daughter}} {{was elected to the}} U.S. Senate in 2000, she moved to Washington, D.C., living along Connecticut Avenue. She appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2004. Once living alone became too much for her, in 2006, she moved into the Clintons' large Whitehaven house in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, D.C. There she would often sit and discuss the day when {{her daughter}} <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

50|$|Talksport TV {{launched}} in October 2004 platform broadcasting {{for six hours}} a day on the Sky Digital television platform aiming to catch listeners who've <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> The service amounted to little more than the televisualisation of TalkSport's broadcasters and pundits presenting the station's Drive Time and Kick Off programmes. The channel closed in 2005 following the takeover of Talksport by UTV Radio.|$|R
30|$|My life in Germany was super-boring… I {{was really}} {{stuck in a}} routine… You <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> like 5  pm or so, you sit {{down in front of}} the telly, and you watch telly until 10.30 when you fall into bed, and it was like that every day… Even if you went {{shopping}} one day, or spent an afternoon on the balcony reading, somehow it was always the same (Sandra).|$|R
5000|$|Selle {{claimed the}} melody for [...] "Let it End" [...] {{came to his}} mind while getting ready for work one morning. He wrote it down and {{developed}} it further while at work, then <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> later that day, sitting at a piano and completing it {{by the end of}} the night. He was issued a copyright for the completed song on November 17, 1975 by the U.S. Copyright Office.|$|E

5000|$|In 1895, Rudolph Bendixen {{started his}} own {{business}} selling his own brand of chewing tobacco. He {{had worked in the}} pension department of Solvay Process Company and quit his job to establish his own business, Bendixen Tobacco Company.

The company was nationally known for their Yara brand chewing tobacco.|$|E
60|$|Little Tessa {{sat alone}} by the fire, {{waiting for her}} father to <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> The {{children}} were fast asleep, all four in the big bed behind the curtain; the wind blew hard outside, and the snow beat on the window-panes; the room was large, and the fire so small and feeble that it didn't half warm the little bare toes peeping {{out of the old}} shoes on the hearth.|$|R
50|$|A {{social worker}} visits Liza and they review Liza's lengthy list of medications. The social worker {{stresses}} {{that it would}} be very dangerous for Liza to become pregnant. When Robin <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> Liza is excited {{that she was able to}} function with the social worker. Robin, however, is depressed. A client had urged him to be adventurous with her hairstyle but then reacted badly when Robin styled it like Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra.|$|R
5000|$|In {{her essay}} {{entitled}} [...] "Why We Love Lindsey," [...] M.S. West {{points out a}} conversation in this episode that illuminates Lindsey's character. Darla asks Lindsey why he always showers when he <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> [...] "You're never dirty," [...] she says. His reply - [...] "I'm always dirty" [...] - gives [...] "insight into Lindsey, or perhaps a clear nod to the fact he doesn't lie to himself, either," [...] West writes.|$|R
