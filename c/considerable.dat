5|$|<b>Considerable</b> {{differences}} exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content, particularly for polyphenols, with shallots having the highest level, {{six times the}} amount found in Vidalia onions. Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content, an amount 11 times higher than in white onions. Red onions have <b>considerable</b> content of anthocyanin pigments, with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10% of total flavonoid content.|$|E
5|$|No {{official}} {{records of}} the trial were kept, which led to <b>considerable</b> confusion in the future.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{it could}} be said that women had made marked social {{progress}} since the Bolshevik Revolution and by the Brezhnev era, comprised a <b>considerable</b> number of sole breadwinners in the country. Some professions such as the medical field had a <b>considerable</b> female workforce, although most of the best jobs (including academics, the state bureaucracy, and the military) remained almost exclusively the domain of men.|$|E

5|$|The release {{managed to}} survive against <b>considerable</b> odds, but the {{surviving}} print is not without severe faults. The surviving print has <b>considerable</b> nitrate deterioration and very poor picture quality in certain parts.

5|$|There {{has been}} <b>considerable</b> {{argument}} among paleontologists {{about whether the}} main wing membranes (brachiopatagia) attached to the hind limbs, and if so, where. Fossils of the rhamphorhynchoid Sordes, the anurognathid Jeholopterus, and a pterodactyloid from the Santana Formation seem {{to demonstrate that the}} wing membrane did attach to the hindlimbs, at least in some species. However, modern bats and flying squirrels show <b>considerable</b> variation in the extent of their wing membranes and it is possible that, like these groups, different species of pterosaur had different wing designs. Indeed, analysis of pterosaur limb proportions shows that there was <b>considerable</b> variation, possibly reflecting a variety of wing-plans.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} {{from a number}} of people that the highly fragmented DG structure wastes a <b>considerable</b> amount of time in s as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other. Furthermore, the DGs can exercise <b>considerable</b> control over a Commissioner with the Commissioner having little time to learn to assert control over their staff.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} Liliaceae genera are popular {{cultivated}} plants {{in private and}} public spaces. Lilies and tulips in particular have had <b>considerable</b> symbolic and decorative value, and appear frequently in paintings and the decorative arts.

5|$|After the shootout in Tombstone, {{his pursuit}} {{and murder of}} those who {{attacked}} his brothers, and after leaving Arizona, Wyatt was often the target of negative newspaper stories that disparaged his and his brothers' reputation. His role in history has stimulated <b>considerable</b> ongoing scholarly and editorial debate. A large body of literature {{has been written about}} Wyatt Earp and his legacy, some of it highly fictionalized. <b>Considerable</b> portions of it are either full of admiration and flattery or hostile debunking.|$|E
5|$|Although Maya cities shared many common features, {{there was}} <b>considerable</b> {{variation}} in architectural style. Such styles {{were influenced by}} locally available construction materials, climate, topography, and local preferences. In the Late Classic, these local differences developed into distinctive regional architectural styles.|$|E
5|$|Although the Hong Kong {{government}} has enacted legislation which nominally protects migrant workers, recourse is time-consuming {{and the costs}} <b>considerable.</b> The legal process {{can take up to}} 15 months to reach the District Court or Labour Tribunal, during which workers have no income.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the outward}} {{terminal}} {{of the line}} {{was to be the}} quay at Watchet, the west pier had been practically unusable for some <b>considerable</b> time, and boats were beached and loaded direct from carts brought on to the foreshore. After <b>considerable</b> public pressure, the Watchet Harbour Act was passed in 1857, placing it under the control of Commissioners; they built a new east pier and rebuilt the west pier; the work was finished in 1862, and 500ton vessels could enter the harbour. The WSMR used the west pier, and the newly arrived, broad gauge West Somerset Railway, a branch from the Bristol and Exeter Railway, used the east pier.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the site}} was {{restored}} during the archaeological investigations, it suffered <b>considerable</b> damage in the 1976 Guatemala earthquake. This resulted in destruction {{of some of the}} restoration work, although some of the damage has now been repaired.|$|E
5|$|An {{increase}} in the trade union movement was an inevitable corollary of this and {{during the war years}} there was a <b>considerable</b> {{increase in}} the membership of the various unions. Despite the <b>considerable</b> rises in the costs of many basic items, the government sought to maintain wages largely as they were. Although the average weekly wage during the war was increased by between 8–12 per cent, it was not enough to keep up with inflation and as a result there was <b>considerable</b> discontent amongst workers, to the extent that industrial action followed. Not all of these disputes were due to economic factors, and indeed in some part they were the result of violent opposition to the issue of conscription, which many trade unionists were opposed to. Nevertheless, the result was very disruptive and {{it has been estimated that}} between 1914 and 1918 there were 1,945 industrial disputes, resulting in 8,533,061 working days lost and £4,785,607 in lost wages.|$|E
5|$|As {{the members}} of this unit came from all over Germany and were mostly {{university}} students and academics, the Lützow Free Corps and their colours gained <b>considerable</b> exposure among the German people.|$|E

5|$|Burne-Jones exerted a <b>considerable</b> {{influence}} on French painting. He was also highly influential among French symbolist painters, from 1889. His work inspired poetry by Swinburne– Swinburne's 1866 Poems & Ballads {{is dedicated to}} Burne-Jones.|$|E
5|$|By 1848 the {{population}} was partly employed in coal mines in Bishop Sutton, and {{in the manufacture of}} stockings and of edge tools to a limited extent; formerly there was a <b>considerable</b> factory for cloth.|$|E
5|$|Captive whales have {{occasionally}} {{been known}} to mimic human speech. Scientists have suggested this indicates a strong desire {{on behalf of the}} whales to communicate with humans, as whales have a very different vocal mechanism, so imitating human speech likely takes <b>considerable</b> effort.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{the primary}} use of {{tellurium}} is copper and steel alloys, where it improves machinability. Applications in CdTe solar panels and semiconductors also consume a <b>considerable</b> portion of tellurium production.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens usually {{travel in}} mated pairs, {{although}} young birds may form flocks. Relationships between common ravens are often quarrelsome, yet they demonstrate <b>considerable</b> devotion to their families.|$|E
5|$|<b>Considerable</b> {{additional}} {{development of}} AIS was required, {{with the first}} production version arriving in February 1942, and subsequently requiring {{an extended period of}} installation development and testing. The first kill by a Mk. VII set was on the night of 5/6 June 1942.|$|E
5|$|<b>Considerable</b> {{effort has}} been made {{connecting}} the shaft tomb tradition to the Teuchitlán tradition, a complex society that occupies much the same geography as the shaft tomb tradition.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert {{had already}} written a <b>considerable</b> body of stories, plays, poems, {{criticism}} and other works before writing Creatures of Impulse. He later wrote the libretti {{to the famous}} series of Savoy operas (composed by Arthur Sullivan) between 1871 and 1896.|$|E
5|$|Goldhagen {{recommends}} several significant {{steps that}} might {{be taken by the}} Church to make reparation for its alleged role. A Moral Reckoning received mixed reviews and was the subject of <b>considerable</b> controversy regarding allegations of inaccuracies and anti-Catholic bias.|$|E
5|$|Having fallen {{somewhat}} into disrepair, {{the structure}} {{came under the}} care of the Banagher Branch of the Offaly Historical Society in the 1980s and <b>considerable</b> restoration work has been undertaken since then.
