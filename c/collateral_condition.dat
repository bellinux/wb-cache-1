The Crosssectional data from 313 randomly selected loan beneficiaries (rice growers), were obtained.

It was concluded that factors which showed significant results in both sources banks and arties were farm size, income level, time requirement, payback period and no. of dependent schooling children. Apart from the mentioned factors which other studies have also established, more interesting factors have been identified by this study including the question of trust between Arties and borrowers built on information of borrowers on reputation obtained by Arties and also follow up by arties on borrowers’ use of credit. Here information seems to play a crucial role in building trust and therefore easing conditions for borrowing since most borrowers received their loans without any <b>collateral</b> <b>conditions.</b> Based on these results, it is suggested that banks must improve the amount of loans to agriculture sector in general and to rice growers in particular taking into account information and follow up of their clients. The lenient polices must be formulated by banks regarding collateral securities so that small scale rice growers can avail the loan facilities at lesser <b>collateral</b> <b>conditions.</b> Besides it, arties must reduce commission rate and other type of charges (per acre fixed quantity of rice).

40|$|Based on {{survey data}} {{covering}} 8, 387 firms in 20 countries we compare credit demand and credit supply for firms in Eastern Europe {{to those for}} firms in selected Western European countries. We find that, while 30 % of firms do not need credit in Eastern Europe, their need for credit is higher than in Western Europe. The firm-level determinants of credit needs in Eastern Europe are quite {{similar to that in}} Western Europe: Firms with alternative financings sources, i. e. government-owned, foreign-owned and internally financed firms, are less likely to need credit. Small firms are also less likely to demand credit than larger firms, suggesting that they may have limited investment opportunities. We find that a higher share of firms is discouraged from applying for a loan in Eastern Europe than in Western Europe. Firms in Eastern Europe seem particularly discouraged by high interest rates compared to firms in Western Europe, with <b>collateral</b> <b>conditions</b> and loan application procedures also more discouraging. The higher rate of discouraged firms in Eastern Europe is related to a stronger reluctance of small and financially opaque firms to apply for a loan compared to Western Europe. While many discouraged firms correctly anticipate that their loan applications would be rejected, a large majority of discouraged firms seem to be creditworthy. At the country-level we find that the higher rate of discouraged firms in Eastern Europe is driven more by the presence of foreign banks than by the macroeconomic environment or the lack of creditor protection. We find no evidence that foreign bank presence leads to stricter loan approval decisions. Our findings suggest to policy makers that the low incidence of bank credit among firms in Eastern Europe, compared to Western Europe, is not driven by less need for credit or banks' reluctance to extend loans. The main driver seems to be that many (creditworthy) firms are discouraged from applying for a loan, due to high interest rates, <b>collateral</b> <b>conditions</b> and cumbersome lending procedures. As discouragement is particularly high among small and opaque firms, as well as in countries with a strong presence of foreign banks, it seems that firms perceive lending standards to have become more reliant on "hard information" with the entry of foreign banks. However, as loan rejection rates are not related to foreign bank presence, it seems that firms' perceptions of the likely lending conditions may be too pessimistic. Thus more transparency about credit eligibility and conditions may improve credit access, particularly in countries with a high presence of foreign banks. Banking, Credit, Transition economies...|$|R

The study was conducted using survey methods on farmers (fattening and cow-calf operation), who use credit. Sample location was determined using two stage cluster random sampling based on beef cattle population, namely region of Grobogan, Blora, Rembang, Wonogiri and Boyolali. Number of respondents was 50 for fattening and 50 for cow-calf operation. Data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistic, which consisted of scoring, income and multiple linear regression. Results showed that income per-year of beef cattle fattening was greater than cow-calf operation (IDR 8, 954, 208. 00 > 1, 606, 786. 00), as well as its contribution to the household farmers’ income (49. 45 > 14. 91 %). Credit return ability was 61. 35 % based on amount of credit IDR 22, 482, 510. Five-C analysis resulted that character and capacity of farmers were in adequate category, while capital, <b>collateral</b> and <b>condition</b> were IDR 14, 932, 500. 00, IDR 58, 740, 000. 00 and IDR 14, 440, 600. 00. Capital and collateral had significant effects, while character, capacity and condition had no significant effects on credit return...|$|R
30|$|Expert systems {{might be}} the most basic method {{employing}} subjective analysis (the so-called “expert” system) to assess credit risk. In expert systems, the evaluation index is the predominant factor determining the final score results. For example, the most famous evaluation index system for corporate credit is the 5 C system (Altman 1968) for which the attributes of character, capacity, capital, <b>collateral,</b> and <b>condition</b> are subjectively judged (i.e., by expert judgment). Moreover, Somervile and Taffler 1995 a compared banker judgment with other forecasting models (e.g., multi-variate statistical models) and considered Institutional Investor country credit ratings as other indicators of banker judgment.|$|R
5|$|On the 16th February 1915, the Third Squadron of the Japanese Navy {{received}} a telegram from the Military Attaché Araki Jiro via Ma-Kung in the Formosa Straits (the main {{base of the}} Squadron) requesting for Japanese help. The Otowa and Tsushima were sent immediately for Singapore. Although help was sent and well received by the British Navy in Singapore, the Japanese Navy was hesitant about doing so initially. Commanding Officer of the Third Squadron, Rear Admiral Tsuchiya Mitsukane had apparently expressed his displeasure in dispatching help as he believed that being a signatory of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, Japan should not interfere {{in the internal affairs}} of another country without attaching <b>collateral</b> <b>conditions.</b> Also, Tsuchiya had recalled how a British ship once anchored at Chilung refused to help put down a Taiwanese revolt on Japan. Seeing that Tsuchiya had no choice but to follow orders from the Japanese Government and Naval Headquarters, Tsuchiya secretly advised his land force not to kill or wound any sepoy intentionally but to simply encourage them to surrender as the former had no enmity with the latter. According to The General Staff of the British Military Headquarters, “in reality the Japanese did not do much…and it was found desirable to disband them as early as possible”. However, from the point of view of Japanese politicians, Japan’s entry into the mutiny was also a form of projecting Japanese power and strength in the region.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Restrictive blind {{signatures}} allow {{a recipient}} {{to receive a}} blind signature on a message not known to the signer but the choice of message is restricted and must conform to certain rules. Partially blind signatures allow a signer to explicitly include necessary information (expiration date, <b>collateral</b> <b>conditions,</b> or whatever) in the resulting signatures under some agreement with receiver. Restrictive partially blind signatures incorporate the advantages of these two blind signatures. The existing restrictive partially blind signature scheme was constructed under certificate-based (CA-based) public key systems. In this paper we follow Brand's construction to propose the first identity-based (ID-based) restrictive blind signature scheme from bilinear pairings. Furthermore, we first propose an ID-based restrictive partially blind signature scheme, which is provably secure in the random oracle model. As an application, we use the proposed signature scheme to build an untraceable off-line electronic cash system followed Brand's construction. Key words: ID-based systems, Blind signatures, Bilinear pairings. 1 Introduction Blind signatures, introduced by Chaum [10], allow a recipient to obtain a signature on message mwithout revealing anything about {{the message to the}} signer. Blind signatures {{play an important role in}} a plenty of applications such as electronic voting, electronic cash schemes where anonymityis of great concern. About the formal definition and security of blind signature schemes, refer to [14, 16 - 18]. Restrictive blind signatures, firstly introduced by Brands [5, 6], which allow a recipient to receive a blind signature on a message not known to the signer but the choice of the messageis restricted and must conform to certain rules. Furthermore, he proposed a highly efficient electronic cash system, where the bank ensures that the user is restricted to embed his identityin the resulting blind signature...|$|R
