His family {{moved back to}} West Hills in the spring, but Whitman remained and {{took a job at}} the shop of Alden Spooner, editor of the leading Whig weekly newspaper the Long-Island Star. While at the Star, Whitman became a regular patron of the local library, joined a town debating society, began attending theater performances, and anonymously published some of his earliest poetry in the New-York Mirror. At age 16 in May 1835, Whitman left the Star and Brooklyn. He moved to New York City to work as a <b>compositor</b> though, in later years, Whitman could not remember where. He attempted to find further work but had difficulty, in part due to a severe fire in the printing and publishing district, and in part due to a general collapse in the economy leading up to the Panic of 1837. In May 1836, he rejoined his family, now living in Hempstead, Long Island. Whitman taught intermittently at various schools until the spring of 1838, though he was not satisfied as a teacher.|$|E

He chose to pay all his pre-bankruptcy creditors in full, even after he had no legal responsibility to do so.|$|E

Weston is the reference implementation of Wayland, while GNOME's Mutter and KDE's KWin are being ported to Wayland as standalone display servers.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{development}} of the London Society of <b>Compositors</b> from the formation of the Society in 1848 until the separation of news <b>compositors</b> from book <b>compositors,</b> for all negotiations concerning news compositors' wage rates and working conditions, following the Hampton Dispute of 1906. This study examines both the growth of the London Society of <b>Compositors</b> and the trends of change and continuity among metropolitan <b>compositors</b> {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century, and it addresses itself to issues in trade union history, to contemporary concepts in the social history of Victorian society and also to aspects of the political press. Within the context of the metropolitan composing trade this study seeks firstly, to explain the presence in Victorian London of a trade union whose organization is archaic and whose level of craft control vis-a-vis employers is singular; secondly, it attempts to explain and to examine the persistence and the pervasive influence of compositors' craft ideology whose form and functions are fifteenth century in origin; thirdly, it considers the impact of the growth of the metropolitan printing industry upon the LSC; fourthly, it examines the union's response to political developments in British society in the second half of the nineteenth century; finally, this thesis throws light on the involvement of some metropolitan <b>compositors</b> in the radical and socialist press in Victorian London...|$|R

25|$|Born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, Garrison {{began his}} {{newspaper}} {{career as an}} apprentice <b>compositor</b> for the Newburyport Herald. He {{became involved in the}} anti-slavery movement in the 1820s, and over time he rejected both the American Colonization Society and the gradualist views of most others involved in the movement. Garrison co-founded The Liberator to espouse his abolitionist views, and in 1832 he organized the New-England Anti-Slavery Society. This society expanded into the American Anti-Slavery Society, which espoused the position that slavery should be immediately abolished. Garrison also emerged as a leading advocate of women's rights, which prompted a split in the abolitionist community. In the 1870s, Garrison became a prominent voice for the woman suffrage movement.|$|E

However, he abandoned the order in his mid-thirties to return to secular life, going on {{to work on the}} editorial staff of Messrs. Cassell & Co. in London for two decades. In the mid-1890s he moved, with his wife Anna, into a three-storey terraced house (9, Cavendish Road) in the newly built South Harringay estate in north London, living there {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

It was for Staveley Iron Works Cricket Club that Barlow first played cricket, becoming a cricket professional with Farsley in Leeds in 1871, which was the year in which he first played for Lancashire. From 1873 to 1877 he was the professional for Saltaire in Bradford. Barlow played one match for Derbyshire in the 1875 season against a United North of England Eleven.|$|E

500|$|Vervliet {{comments}} that Granjon [...] "laid {{the foundation for}} our image of the way an Italic should look."

A proper optical harmony of the angle of slope is characteristic for all Granjon’s Italics; it allowed the <b>compositor</b> to use whole lines of capitals without causing too much giddiness." [...] Granjon also cut many swash capitals, which Vervliet describes as [...] "deliciously daring" [...] and have often been copied, for instance in Robert Slimbach's revivals for Adobe (discussed below).|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} scenes Asylum was given was the scene {{depicting}} the death of Amanda, in which Jason ties her into her sleeping bag and hangs her over a campfire. The risk to the actor and the surrounding woodland [...] was deemed too great to physically perform the scene. Asylum created a composite of two shots to show Amanda burning to death in her sleeping bag. Instead of creating a computer generated (CGI) model of the campfire, a real campfire was filmed. Asylum <b>compositor</b> John Stewart blended that footage with shots of the hanging sleeping bag into a single shot. Stewart digitally altered the flames to keep continuity between frames. Another composite shot {{is used in the}} scene in which Chelsea is hit by a speedboat. Because the scene would be too dangerous for even a stuntperson to perform, Asylum digitally combined footage of Willa Ford reacting to an imaginary boat that runs over her with shots of the actual boat to create the effect.|$|E
