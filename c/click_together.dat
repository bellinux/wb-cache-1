Suddenly, the basket that was dangling below Cap'n Bill struck something with a loud thud, and this was followed by a yell of anger.

Why should people flock to pay for seats for what are {{practically}} dress-rehearsals of an unknown play? Half the principals have had to get up in their parts in two weeks, and they haven't had time to get anything out of them. They are groping for their lines all the time. The girls can't let themselves go in the numbers, because they are wondering {{if they are going to}} remember the steps. The show hasn't had time to <b>click</b> <b>together</b> yet. It's just ragged. Take a look at it in another two weeks! I know! I don't say musical comedy is a very lofty form of art, but still there's a certain amount of science about it. If you go in for it long enough, you learn the tricks, and take it from me that, if you have a good cast and some catchy numbers it's almost impossible not to have a success. We've got an excellent cast now, and the numbers are fine. I tell you--as I tried to tell Pilkington, only he wouldn't listen--that this show is all right. There's a fortune in it for somebody. But I suppose Pilkington is now sitting in the smoking-car of an east-bound train, trying to get the porter to accept his share in the piece instead of a tip!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Alexander {{claims that}} in tribal {{societies}} the various elements of cultural performance were tightly fused, and {{were employed in}} collective rituals in which the entire tribe partook and its members experienced first-hand. In modern societies, these various elements became de-fused (as per Weber's sphere differentiation) {{and for this reason}} actors who wish to appear authentic must draw upon various repertoires. [...] "Fusion", in Alexander's terms, is the moment in a performance when the various elements <b>click</b> <b>together,</b> generate an effective performance, and ultimately move the audience to psychological identification with the actors. A failed performance will be one that the audience will perceive as inauthentic, and will not develop the sense of identification the actors desired.|$|E

Despite famous players and high-profile coach, the team never seemed to <b>click</b> <b>together.</b> The team's first home game against the New England Revolution proved to be a harbinger of things to come. Former Juventus defender Nicola Caricola inadvertently flipped a cross into his own net in the dying minutes to hand New England a 1-0 win in front of 46,000 fans. The resulting play would later be dubbed the [...] "Curse of Caricola" [...] by fans to explain the team's inability to come through with a domestic trophy in their history. Firmani left after eight games (3-5) and was replaced by former Portugal coach Carlos Queiróz, who did no better than even (12-12) the rest of the season. The team made it into the playoffs, only to lose to eventual champions D.C. United.|$|E
50|$|Recap: As expected, both Buffalo's {{offense and}} Connecticut's offense would not click {{early in the}} game. The Bulls would take more first downs in the first quarter, but {{would not be able}} to {{complete}} their drives to end in scores.The Bulls would take the lead in the second quarter with a field goal by Peter Fardon. Connecticut would answer back quickly though with a field goal of their own and a touchdown later in the quarter. The Bulls and Huskies would go into halftime with a score of 3-10, Huskies leading. The third quarter was again hampered by strong defensive plays on both sides of the ball. Khalil Mack and Steven Means paired together to create impressive plays and sacks behind Connecticut's line of scrimmage. Buffalo's offense however, would not <b>click</b> <b>together</b> to overcome Connecticut's strong defense, which was one of the best in the FBS. Connecticut would take another touchdown score in the fourth quarter to put away the game. The Huskies would win the game 17-3. The overall series record between the Bulls and Huskies is 4-15 with Connecticut leading.|$|E

In 2011 he gave birth to the project Black Bandana <b>Click,</b> <b>together</b> with Metal Carter and Noyz Narcos, with the intention to publish an album, Klan Related, and three extra tracks. The project failed because of a sudden break between Duke and Noyz Narcos, due to a personal feud. In 2011 Noyz Narcos suggestivley attacked Duke in the song Snakes. Duke replied with an open dissing track named Stai messo male, in which Noyz is described as a poser, drug-addict, actually coming from a wealthy family. In other songs Montana accused Noyz of having given evidences to the police during several drug investigations which led to the arrest of some Duke's friends.

40|$|In {{the last}} several years, {{there has been an}} {{interest}} in graphical user interfaces as compared with character user interfaces. The "mouse" is the device most closely associated with graphical user interfaces. Key strokes are more closely associated with character user interfaces. Given these associations, is there a preference for the keyboard or for the mouse as an input device? The determination of user preference was reduced to the determination of preference of key strokes or mouse clicks for selection of main menu items. The subjects, university students working with Microsoft Works by Microsoft Corporation, copyright 1987 - 1989, were learning how to use application software. While Microsoft Works was running, tracking software recorded every user key stroke and mouse <b>click,</b> <b>together</b> with data about these key strokes and mouse clicks.
