Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E

40|$|The way couples {{educate their}} children, coparenting, is {{influenced}} by personality and by the satisfaction with {{the division of the}} work around the house, the household <b>chores.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the relationship between the variables of the division of the household <b>chores,</b> personality and coparenting. Participants were 72 couples with their first-born child aged three at the beginning of the study. Three coparenting dimensions were indentified, family-integrity, disparagement and conflict between the parents. 	The results show that Family-integrity with fathers can be predicted by the father’s personality, how much he enjoys the household <b>chores</b> and the satisfaction with the <b>chores.</b> Conflict initiation by mothers can only be predicted by satisfaction with the household <b>chores.</b> 	Three moderation effects were found, one for fathers and two for mothers. 1) When the father is not satisfied with children <b>chores,</b> <b>chores</b> associated with children’s upbringing, lower levels of Disparagement were found, regardless of the score on conscientiousness. However, when the father is very satisfied with children <b>chores</b> and he is also very conscientious high levels of Disparagement occurred. 2) When the mother is satisfied with children <b>chores,</b> low levels of Conflict were found, regardless of the agreeableness of the mother. The level of Conflict increases when the mother is dissatisfied with the children <b>chores</b> and she is also not very agreeable. On the other hand, when the mother is not satisfied with children <b>chores</b> and is very agreeable, the level of Conflict is low. 3) When the mother is satisfied with children <b>chores,</b> the level of Conflict decreases when the mother has a higher level of openness. On the other hand when the mother has a high level of openness the level of Conflict increases if the mother is not satisfied with the children <b>chores...</b>|$|R

5|$|Kirill {{arrives at}} the {{workshop}} of Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev), a prominent and well-recognized master painter, {{who is working on}} a new icon of Jesus Christ. Theophanes is portrayed as a complex character: an established artist, humanistic and God-fearing in his views yet somewhat cynical, regarding his art more as a craft and a <b>chore</b> in his disillusion with other people. His young apprentices have all run away to the town square, where a wrongly convicted criminal is about to be tortured and executed. Kirill talks to Theophanes, and the artist, impressed by the monk's understanding and erudition, invites him to work as his apprentice on the decoration of the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow. Kirill refuses at first, but then accepts the offer on the condition that Theophanes will personally come to the Andronikov Monastery and invite Kirill to work with him in front of all the fraternity and Andrei Rublev, who according to Theophanes' comments has some fame as an icon painter in the outside world.|$|E

Adult gender roles were examined from a general perspective, while children’s <b>chores</b> were examined in five distinctive areas – domestic <b>chores,</b> help with siblings, self-care, outside, and technical <b>chores.</b> The research sample consisted of 238 married and unmarried participants (81 men and 157 women). Specifi-cally, sex-typing of adult gender roles and children’s <b>chores</b> was examined in relation to three sets of background variables: (1) personal background variables (age, religiosity, and ethnicity); (2) education and employment variables (level of education, extent of job position, and earning patterns); and (3) family variables (marital status, length of marriage, number of children, and age of children). The women tended to have less sex-typed attitudes than the men did with regard to children’s <b>chores.</b> However, {{no differences were found}} between the genders with regard to sex-typing of adult gender roles. In addition, the married women expressed more sex-typed attitudes toward adult gender roles than did unmarried women, whereas the differences between married and unmarried men were less significant. Among both genders, a correlation was found between sex-typing of adult gender roles and domestic children’s <b>chores...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} Max-min Share (MmS) allocations {{of items}} {{both in the}} case where items are goods (positive utility) {{and when they are}} <b>chores</b> (negative utility).

We prove that like in the case for goods, an MmS allocation does not need to exist for <b>chores</b> and computing an MmS allocation - if it exists - is strongly NP-hard. In view of these non-existence and complexity results, we present a polynomial-time 2 -approximation algorithm for MmS fairness for <b>chores.</b> We then introduce a new fairness concept called optimal MmS that represents the best possible allocation in terms of MmS that is guaranteed to exist. For both goods and <b>chores,</b> we use connections to parallel machine scheduling to give (1) an exponential-time exact algorithm and (2) a polynomial-time approximation scheme for computing an optimal MmS allocation when the number of agents is fixed...|$|R
