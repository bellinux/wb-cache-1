40|$|In {{hydraulic}} manipulator applications effective joints movement range of above 180 ° is often needed. Vane actuator has maximum movement range about 270 °. However, water hydraulic vane actuators are quite expensive to manufacture. Thus we investigate a possibility to use so called <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> instead of vane actuator. <b>Chain</b> <b>drive</b> {{consists of two}} cylinders which are connected in series with a chain. Reduced model for chain-drive equals to symmetric cylinder and can be compared with a vane actuator of same size. Concerns with <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> are the smoothness of sprocket turning around, stiffness of the chain and minimum required back-pressure level for keeping chain tension. In this paper a <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> is designed, built and tested. We also compare <b>chain</b> <b>drive's</b> and vane actuator's properties mathematically from control point of view.
