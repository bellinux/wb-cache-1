40|$|This article {{addresses}} <b>cultural</b> <b>techniques</b> {{of cognitive}} capitalism. The author argues that {{to understand the}} full implications {{of the notion of}} cognitive capitalism we need to address the media and <b>cultural</b> <b>techniques</b> which conditions its range and applications. The article offers an expanded understanding of the labour of code and programming through a case study of 'metaprogramming', a software related organisation practice that offered a way to think of software creativity and programming in organisations. The ideas from the 1970 s that are discussed offer a different way to approach creativity and collaborative and post-Fordist capitalism. The author brings together different theoretical perspectives, including German media theory and Yann Moulier Boutang’s thesis about cognitive capitalism. The wider argument is that we should {{pay more attention to the}} media archaeological conditions of practices of labour and value appropriation of contemporary technological capitalism as well as the <b>cultural</b> <b>techniques</b> which include 'ontological and aesthetic operations' that produce cultural, material situations...|$|R

5000|$|Whereas ideas might {{previously}} {{have been}} interpreted {{in terms of}} their written form, photography heralded new forms of perceptual experience and knowledge. As one recent commentator put it: 'For Flusser, photography is not only a reproductive imaging technology, it is a dominant <b>cultural</b> <b>technique</b> through which reality is constituted and understood'. In this context, Flusser argued that photographs have to be understood in strict separation from 'pre-technical image forms'. For example, he contrasted them to paintings which he described as images that can be sensibly 'decoded', because the viewer is able to interpret what he or she sees as more or less direct signs of what the painter intended. By contrast, even though photography produces images that seem to be 'faithful reproductions' of objects and events they cannot be so directly 'decoded'. The crux of this difference stems, for Flusser, from the fact that photographs are produced through the operations of an apparatus. And the photographic apparatus operates in ways that are not immediately known or shaped by its operator. For example, he described the act of photographing as follows: ...|$|E
5000|$|Grafting {{of woody}} plants has been common for centuries, but {{herbaceous}} grafting has only become popular recently in agricultural systems. The cultivation of grafted vegetable plants began in Korea and Japan {{at the end}} of the 1920s when watermelon plants were grafted onto squash rootstock1. Since this time, this technique has spread throughout Asia and Europe. Currently, 81% of Korean and 54% of Japanese vegetable cultivation uses grafting. [...] The use of this <b>cultural</b> <b>technique</b> is mainly carried out for intensive cropping systems like greenhouse and tunnel production. This method is especially popular for vegetable production in the orient, and the number of vegetables in 1998 was estimated to be 540 million transplants in Korea and 750 million in Japan. [...] This technique has moved to the Mediterranean region as well, where the use of grafting has been proposed as a major component of an integrated management strategy for managing soilborne disease and increasing crop productivity. Grafted tomato transplant production has increased in Spain from less than one million plants in 1999-2000 to over 45 million plants in 2003-2004. Grafted tomato is also cultivated in France and Italy, and over 20 million tomato plants were grafted in Morocco in 2004 as a way to reduce soilborne disease and increase crop production.|$|E

Many of the values held during that time have long since become today’s status quo. The spirit of awakening, however, has dissipated. In 1997 the following invitation was published online on a website shared by the Berkeley Art Museum and the ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe: “In a homage to times of questioning and change, you are invited to contribute to The Berkeley Oracle your urgent, unforgotten, new or never-asked questions.” As early as the beginning of the 1970s, Jochen Gerz had begun to grapple with the <b>cultural</b> <b>technique</b> of the computer (“These Words are My Flesh & My Blood”, 1971), and in the 1990s he increasingly made use of the possibilities offered by digital communication (e.g. “The Plural Sculpture”, 1995; “The Anthology of Art”, 2001). “The Berkeley Oracle” is an allusion to the Oracle at Delphi. Is the World Wide Web the new oracle? “By neither promising nor delivering answers, The Berkeley Oracle steps out of politics and into philosophy, into art. Gerz invites the participants into a space of questioning and simply leaves them there. It is a space that Pyrrho of Ellis called ‘epoché’, a state of mental suspension in which final knowledge of things is understood to be impossible.” ...|$|E

We thus need new cropping systems optimising all <b>cultural</b> <b>techniques,</b> reconciling agricultural production, herbicide reduction and biodiversity conservation. Here, we show how to (i) develop models quantifying {{the effects of}} cropping systems on weed dynamics, (ii) integrate interactions between weeds and other organisms, (iii) predict the impact on production and biodiversity and (iv) use the model for multicriteria evaluation and multiobjective design of cropping systems.

We have illustrated the development of interaction submodels with the example of a crop pathogen whose propagation is increased when infecting grass weeds. To evaluate the weed flora impact, predicted weed densities were translated into indicators of harmfulness (crop yield loss, technical harvest problems, harvest pollution, field infestation, crop disease increase) and biodiversity (weed species richness and equitability, trophic resources for birds, insects and pollinators). Simulations were run over several years and with different weather scenarios (i) to optimise <b>cultural</b> <b>techniques</b> to control harmful weeds, (ii) to analyse the impact of changing agricultural practices (e. g. simplified tillage and rotations, no-till, temporary crops) on weed density, species and trait composition and (iii) to evaluate cropping systems for their ability to reconcile agricultural production and biodiversity, thus identifying levers for designing sustainable cropping systems...|$|R

40|$|What can {{the study}} of Victorian {{literature}} gain from approaching primary texts explicitly as processing, storing, and transmitting data? I suggest that, by applying tools and methodologies from German media history that are usually reserved for technical and digital media, we can illuminate how individual texts operate and better understand Victorian texts as media, which remains an underdeveloped aspect of materialist literary study. In analysing how Victorian texts depict encounters with traditional plastic art-objects, I develop new applications of Friedrich Kittler’s ideas of recursion and transposition, Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht’s method of reading for Stimmung, and the theory of cultural techniques (Kulturtechniken). I also propose new concepts to further {{our understanding of how}} encounters with art-objects function, such as the observer effect: the simultaneous perception of past and future meanings of an art-object. Close readings of Michael Field’s Sight and Song and Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s Ballads and Sonnets suggest that both volumes acknowledge encounter as a <b>cultural</b> <b>technique,</b> rather than a spontaneous, independent action by the subject. Yet they propose different roles for themselves within that technique. Michael Field’s poems purport to halt the process of recursion, but Rossetti’s demand that readers experience their own observer effects. Meanwhile, Vernon Lee’s Hauntings: Fantastic Stories and Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray demonstrate the agency of art-objects vis-à-vis the <b>cultural</b> <b>technique</b> of encounter. Lee’s stories reveal the threat to an individual subject’s production of future meanings that art-objects pose, in particular through their effects of presence. In Dorian Gray, the art-object’s own data processing circumscribes the subject’s observer effect. Each text thus evidences its operations as a medium and its complicated relationships with other media in the form of art-objects. Each processes data; recurs to art-objects, tropes, or themes and transmits future meanings thereof; and participates in the <b>cultural</b> <b>technique</b> of encounter. In so doing, these texts resisted the threats of marginalisation that faced ‘old media’ from the rise of photography and the incipient development of film at the fin de siècle...|$|E
