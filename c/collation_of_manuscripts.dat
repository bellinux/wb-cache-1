This constitution made the works of the five jurists, Papinian, Paul, Gaius, Ulpian and Modestinus, primary authorities. The works of jurists cited by the five could also be produced, provided in this case that, because of the age of the works, what these jurists said was confirmed by <b>collation</b> <b>of</b> <b>manuscripts.</b> In the case of the five primary authorities no <b>collation</b> <b>of</b> <b>manuscripts</b> was demanded.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} a new modality of exploring variants in a textual collation through {{the support of}} a visual tool. In particular, techniques from Information Visualization were applied to explore the patterns of variants in a collation. To apply the visual tool in a practical case, we used a <b>collation</b> <b>of</b> <b>manuscripts</b> provided by a simulated textual tradition. We show how such an approach may be very useful to quickly discover specific variants, patterns of variants, and compare variants between pairs of manuscripts...|$|E

The list {{is based on a}} new <b>collation</b> <b>of</b> <b>manuscripts</b> which had not been taken account of in Keil’s edition. Our knowledge of a more complete picture of the textual tradition of these glosses allows us to put forth convincing theories regarding the nature and the origin of the glosses. Furthermore, I am able to verify possible correspondences which exist between, on the one hand, the glosses and, on the other, both the texts in Goetz’s Corpus Glossariorum Latinorum and the works of Festus, Nonius Marcellus, and Isidore of Seville. At the end of the paper I examine a problematic Punic gloss, which is included in the other grammatical treatise ascribed to St. Augustin, the Ars breviata (GL V 494 - 496). Martorelli Luca.

50|$|These early textual studies {{convinced}} {{him of the}} absolute necessity of new and more exact <b>collations</b> <b>of</b> <b>manuscripts.</b> From October 1840 until January 1843 he was in Paris, busy with the treasures of the Bibliothèque Nationale, eking out his scanty means by making collations for other scholars, and producing for the publisher, Firmin Didot, several editions of the Greek New Testament — one of them exhibiting {{the form of the}} text corresponding most closely to the Vulgate.

50|$|As J. Koch has shown, the {{commentary}} on the Sentences by Durandus of St. Pourçain (1275-1334) is preserved in three recensions. While the last redaction was printed in the 16th century, the first two versions remain unpublished. Of particular interest is the first, because it contains the sharpest polemic against Thomas Aquinas and because it engendered the most critical response by his contemporaries (such as Petrus de Palude and Petrus Aureoli). In the first place a computerised copy of the third version will be made, which can serve as an effective research instrument.

40|$|The textual {{problems}} of the Pauline epistles have rarely received systematic study since the work of Günther Zuntz in 1953. This thesis is {{a study of the}} text of 1 Corinthians using a different methodology, called "thoroughgoing eclecticism. " The textual data was gathered from <b>collations</b> <b>of</b> <b>manuscripts</b> and critical editions, and is provided as an appendix to the thesis. The discussion of the textual problems in 1 Corinthians comprises most of the thesis. In them, effort was made to determine whether a given type of variation is typical <b>of</b> any single <b>manuscript</b> or <b>of</b> <b>manuscripts</b> in general. The focus is placed on determining the cause of corruption in each place. This required study {{of the history of the}} development of the Greek language and comparison with theological and ethical discussions among early Christians. Detailed discussions are necessary for many problems, including 6 : 5, where a conjecture is found to be necessary; 7 : 33 - 34 and 9 : 5, where issues of marriage and sexuality led to corruption; 13 : 3, where transcriptional and structural issues become prominent, and 14 : 34 - 35, where a complicated displacement of text involved issues <b>of</b> <b>manuscript</b> attestation, interpolation, and anti-feminism. The manuscripts that most frequently attest to early readings and unique forms of the text are then assessed. The most unique witnesses to the text of 1 Corinthians are the Greco-Latin bilinguals DFG. Their relationship and unique causes of corruption are described, with the result that FG are shown to frequently preserve the earliest reading. P N A B are also discussed. These witnesses attest many excellent readings, but have undergone their own types of corruptions. The "Byzantine" witnesses are summarized, demonstrating that they carry only a late form of the text. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|In this essay, {{we review}} {{the methods of}} {{computer-assisted}} stemmatic analysis available to the Canterbury Tales Project. 1 Our belief that these techniques will permit us {{to arrive at a}} more exact reconstruction {{of the history of the}} Canterbury Tales than could Manly and Rickert (1940) is vital to our decision to undertake this work. There are two major strands to these techniques. The first, cladistic analysis, is used to gain a rapid overview of the broad relations among the manuscripts. The second, database analysis, is used to refine conclusions about the exact relationships <b>of</b> particular <b>manuscripts</b> and groups, on the basis of scrutiny of individual variants and their distribution. In addition to discussion of these techniques, we briefly report here the results of our testing of these tools on the Wife <b>of</b> Bath’s Prologue <b>manuscripts,</b> among other materials.

50|$|Faerno's {{literary}} accomplishments {{over the}} next decade gained him the esteem and friendship of the cardinal Giovanni Angelo de Medici, afterwards Pope Pius IV, and of his nephew the cardinal Charles Borromeo. Having acquired a critical knowledge of the Latin language, he was enabled to display much judgment in the correction of the Roman classics, and in the <b>collation</b> <b>of</b> ancient <b>manuscripts</b> on which he was frequently employed. Once Pius IV was elected to the papal throne, Faerno was urged to publish some of the results of his diligent work. He was also offered a bishopric, which he modestly refused. Illness intervened before he could see the works he was preparing through the press and he died at the home of Cardinal Giovanni Morone towards the end of 1561.|$|R
