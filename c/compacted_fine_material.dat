40|$|Abstract. Natural {{gravel bed}} {{channels}} commonly contain a fine mode {{of sand and}} fine gravel that fills voids of the bed framework of coarser gravel. If the supply of <b>fine</b> bed <b>material</b> exceeds the storage capacity of framework voids, excess <b>fine</b> <b>material</b> forms surficial patches, which can be voluminous in pools during low flow. Data collected in 34 natural channels in northern California and southern Oregon indicate the following. (1) <b>Fine</b> <b>material</b> on the bed surface can be readily winnowed and transported at high particle velocities, {{much of it in}} intermittent suspension. <b>Fine</b> <b>material</b> can dominate the bed material load in gravel bed channels, but its abundance on the bed surface is limited by its increasing mobility as hiding places among prominent particles are filled. (2) <b>Fine</b> <b>material</b> in pools is typically replaced many times per year. (3) The proportion V * of residual pool volume filled with <b>fine</b> bed <b>material</b> correlates with annual sediment yield in channels whose parent material produces abundant sandy sediment. (4) Temporal and spatial changes in V * appear to correspond to variations in the balance between sediment inputs and water discharge. These results suggest that V * can be used to monitor and evaluate the supply of excess <b>fine</b> <b>material</b> in gravel bed channels and that samples of <b>fine</b> <b>material</b> in pools can characterize the fine, mobile mode of bed material load. 1...|$|R

40|$|This is the River Leith fluvial audit: Final project report {{produced}} by Lancaster University in 1998. Freeze cores {{extracted from the}} upper and lower ends of River Leith illustrate that the bed is highly compacted in the downstream reach. <b>Fine</b> <b>material</b> is locally derived from bedrock at depths of only 32 cms into the bed and in one core <b>fine</b> <b>material</b> is 66 % of the extracted core. Levels of fines that are believed to be detrimental to fish are put at 20 to 30 %. Reduced flow and stream power from water abstraction may lead to a greater infiltration of <b>fine</b> <b>material</b> if gravels are not regularly flushed through with flood flows. Infiltration of <b>fine</b> <b>material</b> can lead to river bed compaction and concretion. A small abstraction may have no effect on the morphology of a river if the reduced discharge is within the normal range of flows experienced. However if the impact on flows is small it is still possible that fine sediment problems will develop progressively and the effects may not be noticed for several years...|$|R
