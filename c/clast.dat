40|$|ABSTRACT: Petrographic {{study was}} {{performed}} on 5 lithic <b>clasts</b> in the Lewis Cliffs 86001 monomict eucrite. K-rich areas in plagioclase indicate significant shock processing of these <b>clasts.</b> Other <b>clasts</b> with no K-rich areas are probably less shocked. Coexistence of heavily shocked and unshocked <b>clasts</b> in the same breccia indicates either mixing of <b>clasts</b> with different regolith histories or mixing of <b>clasts</b> {{from different parts of}} the same impact crater. General similarities between the 5 <b>clasts</b> suggests that they were from a single crater. INTRODUCTION: Five lithic <b>clasts</b> in Lewis Cliff 86001, 15, a monomict eucrite, have been examined both petrographically and by electron microprobe. Of the five <b>clasts,</b> two (LCi & LCiii) contain small (10 pm- 50 pm wide) chain-like regions with large K-enrichment within plagioclase hosts (Figure 1). The remaining basaltic <b>clasts</b> (LCiv, LCV, LCvi) have no potassium enrichment...|$|R
40|$|Yamato- 82162 (Y- 82162) is a {{regolith}} breccia {{including many}} kinds of <b>clasts.</b> The <b>clasts</b> are classified into 6 clast-types {{on the basis of}} the predominant phase and the textures. They are phyllosilicate, carbonate, unusual, magnetite, composite, and matrix-like clast-types. The phyllosilicate <b>clasts</b> are subdivided into two subtypes, sodian talc-rich and chlorite-rich. The sodian talc-rich <b>clasts</b> consist mainly of sodian talc and minor chlorite (or serpentine), and they are coarsegrained and homogeneous in chemical composition. They seem to have formed in hot and deep interior of the parent body. Chlorite-rich <b>clasts,</b> magnetite <b>clasts,</b> and matrix-like <b>clasts</b> consist mainly of chlorite and minor sodian talc, and they show unique microtextures; amygdule, network-like, and microspherulitic. The three clast-types seem to have formed near the surface of the parent body. Matrix-like and composite <b>clasts</b> are sometimes cut across by phyllosilicate veins, which may have been formed by a fluid coming from the interior of the parent body where sodian talcrich <b>clasts</b> were produced. The unusual <b>clasts</b> include FeO-bearing periclase which sometimes overgrows on magnetite grains and is rimmed by an unknown Fe-Ca-S-O phase, suggesting that the unusual <b>clasts</b> were produced from carbonate-rich precursors by heating events. In addition to these <b>clasts,</b> Y- 82162 includes anhydrous chondritic fragments, which were projectiles collided on the parent body to have produced the regolith breccia of Y- 82162...|$|R

40|$|Essentially {{all of the}} lithic {{and mineral}} <b>clasts</b> in DAG 319,a new polymict ureilite, were studied in order to {{determine}} their petrographic and mineralogical characteristics and their petrologic relationships to one another. Most of the <b>clasts</b> are identifiably from the ureilite parent body or appear to be shock-modified <b>clasts</b> from that body. Others appear to be projectiles derived from other bodies. The many kinds of lithic and mineral <b>clasts</b> found were classified into seven major groups, from A to G. The coarse-grained mafic lithic <b>clasts</b> (A) include three types of ureilitic lithology : type I ureilites, the predominant type, are similar to the common monomict ureilites; type II ureilites are a rare type with an olivine-orthopyroxene-augite lithology with essentially no carbon, and contain magmatic inclusions in the olivines and orthopyroxenes (similar to those in the Hughes 009 ureilite); a third type are magnesian ureilites with an mg > 0. 90,which are shock-produced. Fine-grained mafic lithic <b>clasts</b> (B) may have been derived from typical ureilites by shock, recrystallization, reduction, and/or melting. Felsic lithic <b>clasts</b> (C) are rare and important plagioclase-bearing igneous lithologies, which may represent the so-called missing basaltic melts separated during the formation of the ureilites. These represent several different lithic components. Dark <b>clasts</b> (D) consist mainly of phyllosilicates and sulfides, as well as magnetite (sometimes as framboidal clusters) and carbonates (dolomite, magnesite); some phyllosilicates occur as veins. Sulfide or metal-rich <b>clasts</b> (E) are shock-related, fine-grained lithologies to which sulfide and/or metal has been added; metal-rich <b>clasts</b> may have formed by reduction, and sulfide-rich <b>clasts</b> by oxidation. Rare chondrules and chondritic fragments (F) may be from projectiles which collided with the DAG 319 parent body, and they have characteristics that are more closely related to ordinary than to carbonaceous chondrites. Isolated mineral <b>clasts</b> (G) include many kinds of minerals produced by disaggregation of lithic <b>clasts,</b> but the origin of some of these minerals is uncertain. This paper describes all of these <b>clasts,</b> and is intended as a comprehensive study of the petrologic and mineralogical features of polymict ureilites.

Dark <b>clasts</b> consist of chondrule and mineral fragments, phyllosilicate fragments and clusters, magnetite, sulfides and accessory phases, embedded into a very fine-grained, phyllosilicate-rich matrix.

Their pyroxenes tend to be more MgO-rich, and have lower Fe/Mn ratios which are positively correlated with the Fe/Mg ratio. Some of the mesosiderite basaltic and gabbroic <b>clasts</b> contain xenocrystic plagioclase. The basaltic <b>clasts</b> commonly show superchondritic Eu/Sm ratios and slight LREE depletions. The cumulate gabbro <b>clasts</b> are extremely depleted in LIL, have very high Eu/Sm ratios and high Lu/Sm ratios.

25|$|The 3D {{orientation}} of the <b>clasts</b> is called {{the fabric of the}} rock. Between the <b>clasts,</b> the rock can be composed of a matrix (a cement) that consists of crystals of one or more precipitated minerals. The size and form of <b>clasts</b> can be used to determine the velocity and direction of current in the sedimentary environment that moved the <b>clasts</b> from their origin; fine, calcareous mud only settles in quiet water while gravel and larger <b>clasts</b> are moved only by rapidly moving water. The grain size of a rock is usually expressed with the Wentworth scale, though alternative scales are sometimes used. The grain size can be expressed as a diameter or a volume, and is always an average value– a rock is composed of <b>clasts</b> with different sizes. The statistical distribution of grain sizes is different for different rock types and is described in a property called the sorting of the rock.
