2500|$|Moreover, the {{assumption}} of the received (i.e. useful) signal power being exponentially distributed (for example, due to Rayleigh fading) and the Poisson shot noise (for which the Laplace is known) [...] allows for explicit closed-form expression for the <b>coverage</b> <b>probability</b> based on the SINR.

2500|$|Several early {{stochastic}} {{models of}} wireless networks {{were based on}} Poisson point processes {{with the aim of}} studying the performance of slotted Aloha. Under Rayleigh fading and the power-law path-loss function, outage (or equivalently, <b>coverage)</b> <b>probability</b> expressions were derived by treating the interference term as a shot noise and using Laplace transforms models, which was later [...] extended to a general path-loss function, and then further extended to a pure or non-slotted Aloha case.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of {{cellular}} networks, a heterogeneous network (sometimes known as a HetNet) is a network that uses several types of base stations macro-base stations, pico-base stations, and/or femto-base stations {{in order to provide}} better coverage and bit rates. This is in particular used to cope with the difficulty of covering with macro-base stations only open outdoor environment, office buildings, homes, and underground areas. Recent Poisson-based models have been developed to derive the <b>coverage</b> <b>probability</b> of such networks in the downlink case. The general approach is to have a number or layers or [...] "tiers"' of networks which are then combined or superimposed onto each other into one heterogeneous or multi-tier network. [...] If each tier is a Poisson network, then the combined network is also a Poisson network owing to the superposition characteristic of Poisson processes. Then the Laplace transform for this superimposed Poisson model is calculated, leading to the <b>coverage</b> <b>probability</b> in (the downlink channel) of a cellular network with multiple tiers when a user is connected to the instantaneously strongest base station and when a user is connected to the strongest base station on average (not including small scale fading).|$|E

2500|$|A {{common goal}} of {{stochastic}} geometry wireless network models is to derive expressions for the SINR {{or for the}} functions of the SINR which determine coverage (or outage) and connectivity. For example, the concept of the outage probability pout, which is informally the probability {{of not being able to}} successfully send a signal on a channel, [...] is made more precise [...] in the point-to-point case by defining it as the probability that the SINR of a channel is less than or equal to some network-dependent threshold.

2500|$|Building off {{previous}} work done on an Aloha model, the <b>coverage</b> <b>probability</b> {{for the typical}} user was derived for a Poisson network. The Poisson model of a cellular network proves to be more tractable than a hexagonal model. Meanwhile, this observation could be argued {{by the fact that}} a detailed and precise derivation for the channel attenuation probability distribution function between a random node and a reference base-station for a hexagonal model was explicitly derived in; and this result could be used to tractably derive the outage probability. Furthermore, in the presence of sufficiently large log-normal shadow fading (or shadowing) and a singular power-law attenuation function, it was [...] observed [...] by simulation [...] for hexagonal networks and then later mathematically proved [...] for general stationary (including hexagonal) networks that quantities like the SINR and SIR of the typical user behave stochastically as though the underlying network were Poisson. In other words, given a [...] power-law attention function, using a Poisson cellular network model with [...] constant shadowing is equivalent (in terms of SIR, SINR, etc.) to assuming large log-normal shadowing in the mathematical model with the base stations positioned according to either a deterministic or random configuration with a constant density.|$|E
