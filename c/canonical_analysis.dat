50|$|<b>Canonical</b> <b>analysis</b> {{belongs to}} a group of methods which involve solving the {{characteristic}} equation for its latent roots and vectors. It describes formal structures in hyperspace invariant with respect to the rotation of their coordinates. In this type of solution, rotation leaves many optimizing properties preserved, provided it takes place in certain ways and in a subspace of its corresponding hyperspace. This rotation from the maximum intervariate correlation structure into a different, simpler and more meaningful structure increases the interpretability of the canonical weights C and D. In this the <b>canonical</b> <b>analysis</b> differs from Harold Hotelling’s (1936) canonical variate analysis (also called the canonical correlation analysis), designed to obtain maximum (canonical) correlations between the predictor and criterion canonical variates. The difference between the canonical variate analysis and <b>canonical</b> <b>analysis</b> is analogous to the difference between the principal components analysis and factor analysis, each with its characteristic set of commonalities, eigenvalues and eigenvectors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, it {{presents}} a novel approach for selecting discriminative features in multimodal information fusion based discriminative multiple <b>canonical</b> correlation <b>analysis</b> (DMCCA), which is the generalized form of <b>canonical</b> correlation <b>analysis</b> (CCA), multiple <b>canonical</b> correlation <b>analysis</b> (MCCA) and discriminative <b>canonical</b> correlation <b>analysis</b> (DCCA). The proposed approach identifies the discriminative features from the multi-feature in Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT) domain, which are capable of simultaneously maximizing the within-class correlation and minimizing the between-class correlation, leading to better utilization of the multi-feature information and producing more effective pattern recognition results. The effectiveness of the introduced solution is demonstrated through extensive experimentation on a visual based emotion recognition problem. ...|$|R

This framework, called measure transformed <b>canonical</b> correlation <b>analysis</b> (MTCCA), applies LCCA to the data after transformation of the joint probability measure. We show that judicious choice of the transform leads to a modified <b>canonical</b> correlation <b>analysis,</b> which, in contrast to LCCA, is capable of detecting non-linear relationships between the considered pair of random vectors.

Much attention in <b>canonical</b> <b>analysis</b> is given to inference methods for the eigenvalues of the second order coefficient matrix of the model.
