500|$|Bembo {{does not}} attempt to {{strictly}} copy all the features of Renaissance printing, instead blending them with a twentieth-century sensibility and the expectations of contemporary design. An eccentricity of Griffo's first De Aetna capitals was an asymmetrical M that {{does not seem to}} have a serif at top right. So odd it has been suggested it may have been the result of faulty casting of type, it was nonetheless often copied in French imitations by Garamond and his contemporaries. The final release of Monotype's revival did not follow this, although it was available by special order. Monotype also did not copy the curving capital Y used by Manutius in the tradition of the Greek letter upsilon which had been used in some versions of Poliphilus and Blado, although not in the digitisation of Poliphilus. Nesbitt has described the capitals as [...] "a <b>composite</b> <b>design</b> in the spirit of [...] type". Historian James Mosley reports that other changes from the earliest versions were reduction in the weight of the capitals and alteration of the 'G' by adding the conventional right-hand serif, and widening the 'e', and suggests that the numerals of Bembo were based on those Monotype had already developed for the typeface Plantin.|$|E

2500|$|The Dakin {{building}} {{has won a}} number of architectural awards including an American Institute of Architects Design Excellence Award in 1992. According to the San Francisco Examiner the jury awarded this distinction to the Dakin building because [...] "Its chief strength is the atrium, with its views of the San Francisco Bay and asymmetrical skylight". The same newspaper article noted that the building [...] "houses executive offices, research and development facilities and product showrooms". Further in the same newspaper article, {{it is noted that}} the Dakin building was built over thick bay mud formations that are expected to subside up to ten feet by the year 2006; therefore, the main entrance ramp was built on a giant hinge to allow the earth to settle, while the building, resting on driven piles, remains stationary. The year 2006 has arrived, and indeed the flexibility in the ramp allowed the building to effectively [...] "rise" [...] above the land around it. However, the subsidence undermined the safety of the ramps causing structural damage to the concrete and opening up small crevice-like cracks in its connective fabric. Their angle eventually violated city regulations for disabled-person access and in October, 2006 the ramps were replaced with a <b>composite</b> <b>design</b> of stairs, disabled-access lift, and switchback ramps.|$|E
2500|$|His initial {{assignment}} {{was to create}} a children's record library for the four-year-old company, for which he created the [...] "Bozo the Clown" [...] character. He wrote and produced a popular series of storytelling record-album and illustrative read-along book sets beginning with the October 1946 release of [...] "Bozo at the Circus." [...] His record-reader concept, which enabled children to read and follow a story in pictures while listening to it, was the first of its kind. The Bozo image was a <b>composite</b> <b>design</b> of Livingston's, derived from a variety of clown pictures and given to an artist to turn into comic-book-like illustrations. Livingston then hired Pinto Colvig to portray Bozo on the recordings. Colvig, a former circus clown, was also the original voice of Walt Disney's Pluto, Goofy, Grumpy, Sleepy and many other characters. Billy May produced the music. The series {{turned out to be a}} smash hit for Capitol, selling over eight million albums in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Successful record sales led to a variety of Bozo-related merchandise and the first television series, [...] "Bozo's Circus," [...] starring Pinto Colvig on KTTV-Channel 11 (CBS) in Los Angeles in 1949. The character also became a mascot for the record company and was later nicknamed [...] "Bozo the Capitol Clown." ...|$|E
2500|$|Designed as a {{cruising}} cutter for Bering Sea service, Manning {{was built}} by Atlantic Works, East Boston, Massachusetts, for the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service. She was accepted by Captain R.M Clark for the Revenue Cutter Service on 11 August 1897. She commissioned on 8 January 1898 and was assigned cruising grounds along the New England coast. Her lines were those of ancestral clipper cutters, but with a plumb bow instead of the more graceful clipper stem. She was powered by a 2,181 horsepower triple expansion steam engine and utilized a coal fired high pressure boiler which allowed {{a top speed of}} 17 knots. The hull was of composite construction with frames placed at two foot intervals with 3/8 inch steel plate and sheathed from her bottom to two feet above the waterline with five inch thick Oregon fir planks. Below the waterline Manning was sheathed in copper and had eleven watertight bulkheads. The <b>composite</b> <b>design</b> was thought at the time better to weather the ice conditions of the Bering Sea. As tensions mounted before the Spanish–American War was declared, she carried a single bow torpedo tube. Manning and her sister ships USRC Gresham, USRC McCulloch, USRC Algonquin, and [...] were the last cruising cutters rigged for sail and carried the first electric generators installed on cutters. As a class, they were suitable for scouting, for rendering assistance, and for cruising at moderately long range. So successful was the design that these cutters furnished the general pattern for cutter construction for the ensuing 20 years.|$|E

The Mach 3 staging was dominated by shock wave interactions between the orbiter and booster vehicles throughout the relative spatial locations of interest. The inference space was partitioned into several contiguous regions within which the separation aerodynamics were presumed to be well-behaved and estimable using central <b>composite</b> <b>designs</b> capable of fitting full second-order response functions. The underlying aerodynamic response surfaces of the booster vehicle in belly-to-belly proximity to the orbiter vehicle were estimated using piecewise-continuous lower-order polynomial functions.
