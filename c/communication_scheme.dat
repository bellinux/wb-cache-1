40|$|Using chaotic {{signals in}} {{spread-spectrum}} communications {{has a few}} clear advantages over traditional approaches. Chaotic signals are nonperiodic, wide-band, {{and more difficult to}} predict, reconstruct, and characterize than periodic carriers. These properties of chaotic signals {{make it more difficult to}} intercept and decode the information modulated upon them. However, many suggested chaos-based <b>communication</b> <b>schemes</b> do not provide processing gain, a feature highly desirable in spread-spectrum <b>communication</b> <b>schemes.</b> In this paper, we suggest two <b>communication</b> <b>schemes</b> that provide a processing gain. The performance of these and of the earlier proposed differential chaos shift keying is studied analytically and numerically for discrete time implementations. It is shown that, when performance is characterized by the dependence of bit error rate on 0, the increase of the spreading sequence length beyond a certain point degrades the performance. For a given 0, there is a length of the spreading sequence that minimizes the bit error rate. I...|$|R
50|$|Fieldbus is an {{industrial}} network system for real-time distributed control. It {{is a way}} to connect instruments in a manufacturing plant. Fieldbus works on a network structure which typically allows daisy-chain, star, ring, branch, and tree network topologies. Previously, computers were connected using RS-232 (serial connections) by which only two devices could communicate. This would be the equivalent of the currently used 4-20 mA <b>communication</b> <b>scheme</b> which requires that each device have its own communication point at the controller level, while the fieldbus is the equivalent of the current LAN-type connections, which require only one communication point at the controller level and allow multiple (hundreds) of analog and digital points to be connected at the same time. This reduces both the length of the cable required and the number of cables required. Furthermore, since devices that communicate through fieldbus require a microprocessor, multiple points are typically provided by the same device. Some fieldbus devices now support control schemes such as PID control on the device side instead of forcing the controller to do the processing.|$|E
50|$|LVDS {{works in}} both {{parallel}} and serial data transmission. In parallel transmissions multiple data differential pairs carry several signals at once including a clock signal to synchronize the data. In serial communications, multiple single-ended signals are serialized {{into a single}} differential pair with a data rate {{equal to that of}} all the combined single-ended channels. For example, a 7-bit wide parallel bus serialized into a single pair that will operate at 7 times the data rate of one single-ended channel. The devices for converting between serial and parallel data are the serializer and deserializer, abbreviated to SerDes when the two devices are contained in one integrated circuit.As an example, FPD-Link actually uses LVDS in a combination of serialized and parallel communications. The original FPD-Link designed for 18-bit RGB video has 3 parallel data pairs and a clock pair, so this is a parallel <b>communication</b> <b>scheme.</b> However, each of the 3 pairs transfers 7 serialized bits during each clock cycle. So the FPD-Link parallel pairs are carrying serialized data, but use a parallel clock to recover and synchronize the data.|$|E
5000|$|Based on the {{macroscopic}} {{theory of}} ideal (free) diffusion the impulse response of a unicast molecular communication channel {{was reported in}} a paper that identified that the impulse response of the ideal diffusion based molecular communication channel experiences temporal spreading. Such temporal spreading has a deep impact {{in the performance of}} the system e.g. in creating the intersymbol interference (ISI) at the receiving nanomachine. In order to detect the concentration-encoded molecular signal two detection methods named sampling-based detection (SD) and energy-based detection (ED) have been proposed. While the SD approach is based on the concentration amplitude of only one sample taken at a suitable time instant during the symbol duration, the ED approach is based on the total accumulated number of molecules received during the entire symbol duration. In order to reduce the impact of ISI a controlled pulse-width based molecular <b>communication</b> <b>scheme</b> has been analysed.

This equivalence concerns all the stages of the communication channel: the encoded state, the optimal amplifier for the channel, the master equation modeling the loss, and the output measurement scheme.
