5|$|There {{were four}} classes when the {{championship}} started in 1949; 500cc, 350cc, 250cc and 125cc. The 50cc <b>class</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced in the}} 1962 season.

The 350cc <b>class</b> <b>was</b> discontinued in 1982; two years later the 50cc <b>class</b> <b>was</b> replaced with an 80cc class, which was discontinued in 1989.

The reduction of work over the Brighton main line and the prevalence of the N class precipitated another move to Stewarts Lane shed in London.

The ships retained the unusual hexagonal main battery layout of the Nassau class.|$|E
