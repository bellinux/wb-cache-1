40|$|In this study, 4 -chlorobiphenyl (4 -CB) was {{investigated}} in a laboratory-scale apparatus to determine the products of its thermal decomposition, under conditions {{similar to those that}} occur in fires and waste <b>combustion.</b> The <b>apparatus</b> consisted of a laminar flow reactor equipped with a sampling system for intercepting the volatile and condensable products. A XAD- 2 cartridge was used to trap the volatile organic compounds (VOC) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F). The analysis of VOC involved high resolution gas chromatography (HRGC) - quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) while HRGC - ion trap (IT) MS/MS quantitated the PCDD/F produced. The VOC analysis revealed the formation of chlorophenols and chlorobenzenes, which are important precursors for the formation of PCDD/F. Other detected products included benzaldehyde, naphthalene, 3 -ethylbenzaldehyde, 1 -chloro- 4 -ethynylbenzene and benzofuran. The results indicative the formation of mono to acta PCDF, as well as mono, di and hexa to acta chlorinated DD, with monochlorodibenzofuran (MCDF) being the most abundant CDD/F formed.

40|$|Meat {{and bone}} meal (MBM) was co-fired in a {{laboratory}} scale fluidised bed <b>combustion</b> (FBC) <b>apparatus</b> to-ether with three different primary fuels: two coal types and olive bagasse residues. Several two component fuel blends were tested under different combustion conditions to study how primary fuel substitution by MBM affects flue gas emissions as well as fluidised bed (FB) agglomeration tendency. MBM, being a highly volatile fuel, caused significant increase of CO emissions and secondary air {{should be used in}} industrial scale applications to conform to regulations. The high N-content of MBM is moderately reflected on the increase of nitrogen oxides emissions, which are reduced by MBM derived volatiles. The MBM ash, although containing bone material rich in Ca. did not create any noteworthy desulphurisation effect. The observed slight decrease in SO 2 emissions is predominantly attributed to the lower Sulphur content in the coal/MBM fuel mixtures. The experimental work is evaluated with bed agglomeration indices from literature. The SEMYEDS analysis of bed material samples from the coal/MBM tests revealed the formation of conglomerates of bed material debris and ash with sizes that do not greatly exceed the original bed inventory and thus are not problematic. On the contrary, the co-combustion tests of olive bagasse residues with MBM led to a prompt loss of fluidisation, {{as a consequence of the}} high potassium and silicon content of the olive bagasse, the chlorine contents in both MBM and olive bagasse, and the high phosphorus content in the MBM also forming eutectics with potassium.

40|$|The {{physical}} and chemical characteristics {{as well as the}} elemental composition of coals vary widely. Therefore, the behavior during heating and combustion may be qualitatively similar from coal to coal but quantitatively very different. An experimental system was developed in which pyrolysis could be studied separately from <b>combustion.</b> The <b>apparatus</b> simulated the thermal conditions experienced by particles of coal in a hot furnace under rates of heating as high as 3 × 105 K/s. The investigation utilized a thermally stabilized burner (TSB), in which a flame from premixed ethane/air was stabilized by thermal feedback without recirculation of the products of reaction. The pyrolysis of coal was carried out in the hot products of combustion of a stoichiometric mixture of ethane and air (essentially N 2, CO 2, and H 2 O). Pseudo-steady-state combustion was used in the present work; the flame was allowed to drift very slowly, under constant gas/operating conditions, from one location towards that corresponding to a stationary state, thus producing a continuous change in residence time for the particles within the hot, inert gas. Thus, collecting devolatilized coal particles at the outlet of the combustor while the flame drifted was equivalent to collecting pyrolyzed particles at different downstream positions relative to the flame front. The loss in weight of the coal particles was determined in these experiments {{as a function of the}} residence time for particles of different size. ^ A model was also developed to predict the pyrolysis of coal in the TSB.

40|$|Development {{tests are}} being {{conducted}} to characterize unconfined Hydrogen/air and Hydrogen/Oxygen blast characteristics. Most {{of the existing}} experiments for these types of explosions address contained explosions, like shock tubes. Therefore, the Hydrogen Unconfined <b>Combustion</b> Test <b>Apparatus</b> (HUCTA) has been developed as a gaseous combustion test device for determining the relationship between overpressure, impulse, and flame speed at various mixture ratios for unconfined reactions of hydrogen/oxygen and hydrogen/air. The system consists of a central platform plumbed to inject and mix component gasses into an attached translucent bag or balloon while monitoring hydrogen concentration. All tests are ignited with a spark with plans to introduce higher energy ignition sources in the future. Surrounding the platform are 9 blast pressure "Pencil" probes. Two high-speed cameras are used to observe flame speed within the combustion zone. The entire system is raised approx. 6 {{feet off the ground}} to remove any ground reflection from the measurements. As of this writing greater than 175 tests have been performed and include Design of Experiments test sets. Many of these early tests have used bags or balloons between approx. 340 L and approx. 1850 L to quantify the effect of gaseous mixture ratio on the properties of interest. All data acquisition is synchronized between the high-speed cameras, the probes, and the ignition system to observe flame and shock propagation. Successful {{attempts have been made to}} couple the pressure profile with the progress of the flame front within the combustion zone by placing a probe within the bag.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present work was the development of micro <b>combustion</b> calorimetry <b>apparatus</b> and methods to study organic compounds. A micro rotating bomb combustion calorimeter requiring only 10 mg to 30 mg samples for a precise determination of the energies of combustion of solid organic compounds was developed. The accuracy of the apparatus was tested by determining the standard molar enthalpy of formation of 4 chlorobenzoic acid in the crystalline state at 298. 15 K (Chapter 2). An attempt was made, to adapt the gravimetric method of carbon dioxide analysis, {{used to assess the}} completeness of the combustion reactions in macro combustion reactions in macro combustion calorimetry to the micro scale. This work required the design and construction of a new micro combustion bomb with two inlet valves, that can be adapted to the calorimetric apparatus referred to above and a CO_ 2 absorption line. Tests made with benzoic acid indicate that the procedure used in this Thesis needs improvement (Chapter 2). An apparatus for the determination of enthalpies of sublimation by the Knudsen effusion method, previously developed at the Instituto Superior Tecnico Thermochemistry Laboratory, was modified to extend the temperature range of the measurements up to ca. 500 K (Chapter 2). The reliability of the apparatus was checked by measuring of the standard molar enthalpies of sublimation of ferrocene and titanocene dichloride. The relation between energetics and structure in hydroxybenzoic (Chapter 3) and hydroxynicotinic acids (Chapter 4) was studied by using results of micro combustion calorimetry, Knudsen effusion method and differential scanning calorimetry (Dsc).

For this purpose theoretical and experimental works concerning kinetics and thermodynamics of NOx transformations have been carried out.

To our Knowledge there is very few publications describing thé use of such modified cône calorimeters and providing data regarding thé effect of ventilation on thé fire properties.

40|$|Sasols {{synthetically}} derived gasoline {{blending components}} {{have traditionally been}} combined predominantly according to process economics to formulate commercial fuel blends that meet in-house fit-for-purpose requirements and the legislated fuel specifications in South Africa. In this study the potential for optimisation of a fuel blend using full boiling range synthetic blending components to enhance its performance in a modern charge boosted gasoline direct injection engine was investigated. An evaluation of detailed analytical fuel chemistry data was conducted followed by laminar ame speed experiments in a constant-volume <b>combustion</b> bomb <b>apparatus</b> in order to characterise the combustion behaviour of the blending components according to their characteristic chemical properties. A matrix of test fuels was established by splash blending the synthetic components with a commercial synthetic reference fuel. The performance of the fuels was subsequently evaluated using a modern, charge boosted, single cylinder GDI research engine. While the engine operation was verified {{to be in the}} negative-K region using model fuel components, anomalies in de fining the K-value using the synthetic blends were discovered. A fuel blending model was composed to allow prediction of linear and non-linear fuel properties of user de fined synthetic blend ratios. By integrating an engine performance test fuel scoring system, the model could be used to de fine optimal fuel blends through selection of a desired performance criterion while constraining the optimisation process to adhere to the national legislated gasoline specifications. Four final fuel blends were optimised according to best power output, gravimetric specific fuel consumption, volumetric specific fuel consumption and specific legislated emissions. A fifth blend was optimised for highest power output with no regard for fuel property specifications other than Reid vapour pressure. The performance of the optimised blends was evaluated on the test engine and the results indicated the potential to positively affect the performance characteristics of a synthetic fuel blend for use in a modern spark ignition engine. This study demonstrates a methodology for optimisation of a synthetic fuel to user-selected performance criteria and it is believed that this work represents a novel and valuable contribution to this field...|$|R
