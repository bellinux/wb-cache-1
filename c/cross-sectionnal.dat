Two characterization methods {{were used to}} analyse the electrical compensation in GaN:Fe. A first study by Hall effect have been performed down to the sapphire substrate thanks to reactive ion etching steps. The local electrical response of GaN:Fe has also been investigated by <b>cross-sectionnal</b> Electrostatic Force Microscopy (EFM), showing that GaN:Fe is efficiently compensated in the first 0. 5 to 2 micron next to the substrate. From these measurements it appears that Fe-doping is more efficient when Fe is incorporated in the GaN grown in a 3 D than in a 2 D growth-mode. (Â© 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|This paper, {{relying on}} the results of several <b>cross-sectionnal</b> growth regressions, {{examines}} the factors determining the sustainability of policy reforms and growth in Africa. Five structural factors are considered as determinants of policy: 1) ethno-linguistic fragmentation, which influences growth directly rather than through policy, 2) human capital, which due to its low level is an impediment to good policy, although its effect is in all likelihood waning, 3) vulnerability to external shocks, possibly dampened thanks to better management and democratization, 4) political factors, mainly political instability and violence, which themselves partly depend on the previous factors, 5) foreign aid which could be allocated and "conditionned" so as to be more conducive to policy reform and growth. A simplified structural model of growth and policy, estimated in first differences and by GMM, and supplemented by an estimate of a political instability function, summarizes the main lines of our arguments. ...|$|E

DESIGN: Multirisk cohort of HIV- 1 infected patients. METHOD: The three nutritional variables were studied in Cox proportional hazard models as time dependant variables. RESULTS: The sample included 2376 subjects (median follow up: 43. 1 months), of those 675 experienced an AIDS defining event. After adjustment for well known prognostic factors, the reported weight loss greater than 10 % tripled the risk of progression to clinical AIDS (Hazard ratio [HR] 3. 0. 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 5 - 3. 7). For measured weight loss under 5 %. between 5 % and 10 % and greater than 10 % of baseline weight compared with no weight loss, hazard ratios were respectively 1. 8 (CI 1. 5 - 2. 2), 2. 6 (CI 2. 1 - 3. 2) and 5. 1 (CI 4. 1 - 6. 4). The relative risks of AIDS were 1. 7 (CI 1. 3 - 2. 2) for BMI between 17 kg/m 2 and 18. 5 kg/m 2, 2. 6 (CI 1. 7 - 4. 0) for BMI between 16 kg/m 2 and 17 kg/m 2 and 4. 7 (CI 3. 0 - 7. 4) for BMI under 16 kg/m 2. COMMENTS: Even a limited weight loss measured {{at a given time}} during follow up increases the risk of HIV progression; moreover, a simple <b>cross-sectionnal</b> measure of BMI has a good predictive value for subsequent development of clinical disease...|$|E
