However, {{the vast majority}} of counterparties do not have liquid CDS quotes and need proxy CDS rates. Existing methods cannot account for counterparty-specific default risks; we propose to construct proxy CDS rates by associating to illiquid counterparty liquid CDS Proxy based on Machine Learning Techniques. After testing 156 classifiers from 8 most popular classifier families, we found that some classifiers achieve highly satisfactory accuracy rates. Furthermore, we have rank-ordered the performances and investigated performance variations amongst and within the 8 classifier families.

40|$|The optimal {{reinsurance}} {{arrangement is}} identified whenever the reinsurer <b>counterparty</b> <b>default</b> <b>risk</b> {{is incorporated in}} a one-period model. Our default risk model allows the possibility for the reinsurer to fail paying in full the promised indemnity, whenever it exceeds the level of regulatory capital. We also investigate {{the change in the}} optimal solution if the reinsurance premium recognises or not the default in payment. Closed form solutions are elaborated when the insurer's objective function is set via some well-known risk measures. It is also discussed the effect of reinsurance over the policyholder welfare. If the insurer is Value-at-Risk regulated, then the reinsurance does not increase the policyholder's exposure for any possible reinsurance transfer, even if the reinsurer may default in paying the promised indemnity. Numerical examples are also provided in order to illustrate and conclude our findings.

Linear state space methods can be used for the statistical treatment of the model. The new framework is illustrated for time series of insurance claims, credit card purchases and road safety.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, <b>counterparty</b> <b>default</b> <b>risk</b> has {{experienced}} an increased interest both by academics {{as well as}} practitioners. This was especially motivated by the market turbulences and the financial crises {{over the past years}} which have highlighted the importance of <b>counterparty</b> <b>default</b> <b>risk</b> for uncollateralized derivatives. The following paper focuses on the pricing of derivatives subject to such counterparty risk. After a succinct introduction to the topic, a brief review of state-of-the-art methods for the calculation of bilateral counterparty value adjustments is presented. Due to some weaknesses of these models, a novel method for the determination of model-free tight lower and upper bounds on these adjustments is presented. It will be shown in detail how these bounds can be easily and eciently calculated by the solution of a corresponding linear optimization problem. It will be illustrated how usual discretization methods like Monte Carlo methods allow to reduce the calculation of bounds to an ordinary finite dimensional transportation problem, whereas a continuous time approach will lead to a general mass transportation problem. The paper is closed with several applications of these model-free bounds, like stress-testing and estimation of model reserves. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} going to {{quantify}} the mitigation of the insurance as a risk mitigant in operational risk management for the commercial bank. Due to the uncertainties associated with the insurance policy, such as <b>counterparty</b> <b>default,</b> payment uncertainty and the liquidity risk (i. e., delayed payment), the recovery amounts are subjected {{to be kind of}} uncertainty. Thus, the efficiency of insurance as a risk mitigant may be discounted. We aim at going one step further to consider <b>counterparty</b> <b>default,</b> payment uncertainty and liquidity <b>risk.</b> While the <b>counterparty</b> <b>default</b> model focuses on calibration of the default time, the payment uncertainty is set as a non-increasing function depending on loss severity. The key conclusions are that <b>counterparty</b> <b>default</b> does not have significant impact on the capital calibration but still paramount in risk management, and insurance as a risk mitigant indeed improve the operational risk profile of bank and lower the capital requirement to some extent...|$|R
