500|$|A <b>calibration</b> <b>curve</b> is used {{by taking}} the {{radiocarbon}} date reported by a laboratory, and reading across from that date on the vertical axis of the graph. The point where this horizontal line intersects the curve will give the calendar age of the sample on the horizontal axis. This is the reverse {{of the way the}} curve is constructed: a point on the graph is derived from a sample of known age, such as a tree ring; when it is tested, the resulting radiocarbon age gives a data point for the graph.Over the next thirty years many calibration curves were published using a variety of methods and statistical approaches. These were superseded by the INTCAL series of curves, beginning with INTCAL98, published in 1998, and updated in 2004, 2009, and 2013. The improvements to these curves are based on new data gathered from tree rings, varves, coral, plant macrofossils, speleothems, and foraminifera. [...] The INTCAL13 data includes separate curves for the northern and southern hemispheres, as they differ systematically because of the hemisphere effect; there is also a separate marine <b>calibration</b> <b>curve.</b> For a set of samples with a known sequence and separation in time such as a sequence of tree rings, the samples' radiocarbon ages form a small subset of the <b>calibration</b> <b>curve.</b> The resulting curve can then be matched to the actual <b>calibration</b> <b>curve</b> by identifying where, in the range suggested by the radiocarbon dates, the wiggles in the <b>calibration</b> <b>curve</b> best match the wiggles in the curve of sample dates. This [...] "wiggle-matching" [...] technique can lead to more precise dating than is possible with individual radiocarbon dates. [...] Wiggle-matching can be used in places where there is a plateau on the <b>calibration</b> <b>curve,</b> and hence can provide a much more accurate date than the intercept or probability methods are able to produce. [...] The technique is not restricted to tree rings; for example, a stratified tephra sequence in New Zealand, known to predate human colonization of the islands, has been dated to 1314AD ± 12 years by wiggle-matching. The wiggles also mean that reading a date from a <b>calibration</b> <b>curve</b> can give more than one answer: this occurs when the curve wiggles up and down enough that the radiocarbon age intercepts the curve in more than one place, which may lead to a radiocarbon result being reported as two separate age ranges, corresponding to the two parts of the curve that the radiocarbon age intercepted.|$|E
500|$|To {{produce a}} curve {{that can be}} used to relate {{calendar}} years to radiocarbon years, a sequence of securely dated samples is needed which can be tested to determine their radiocarbon age. The study of tree rings led to the first such sequence: individual pieces of wood show characteristic sequences of rings that vary in thickness because of environmental factors such as the amount of rainfall in a given year. These factors affect all trees in an area, so examining tree-ring sequences from old wood allows the identification of overlapping sequences. In this way, an uninterrupted sequence of tree rings can be extended far into the past. The first such published sequence, based on bristlecone pine tree rings, was created by Wesley Ferguson. Hans Suess used this data to publish the first <b>calibration</b> <b>curve</b> for radiocarbon dating in 1967. The curve showed two types of variation from the straight line: a long term fluctuation with a period of about 9,000 years, and a shorter term variation, often referred to as [...] "wiggles", with a period of decades. Suess said he drew the line showing the wiggles by [...] "cosmic schwung", by which he meant that the variations were caused by extraterrestrial forces. It was unclear for some time whether the wiggles were real or not, but they are now well-established. [...] These short term fluctuations in the <b>calibration</b> <b>curve</b> are now known as de Vries effects, after Hessel de Vries.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea behind}} {{radiocarbon}} dating is straightforward, but {{years of work}} were required to develop the technique {{to the point where}} accurate dates could be obtained. Research has been ongoing since the 1960s to determine what the proportion of [...] in the atmosphere has been over the past fifty thousand years. The resulting data, {{in the form of a}} <b>calibration</b> <b>curve,</b> is now used to convert a given measurement of radiocarbon in a sample into an estimate of the sample's calendar age. Other corrections must be made to account for the proportion of [...] in different types of organisms (fractionation), and the varying levels of [...] throughout the biosphere (reservoir effects). [...] Additional complications come from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, and from the above-ground nuclear tests done in the 1950s and 1960s. Because the time it takes to convert biological materials to fossil fuels is substantially longer than the time it takes for its [...] to decay below detectable levels, fossil fuels contain almost no , and as a result there was a noticeable drop in the proportion of [...] in the atmosphere beginning in the late 19th century. Conversely, nuclear testing increased the amount of [...] in the atmosphere, which attained a maximum in 1963 of almost twice what it had been before the testing began.|$|E

500|$|In 1947, scrolls were {{discovered}} in caves near the Dead Sea that proved to contain writing in Hebrew and Aramaic, {{most of which are}} thought to have been produced by the Essenes, a small Jewish sect. [...] These scrolls are of great significance in the study of Biblical texts because many of them contain the earliest known version of books of the Hebrew bible. A sample of the linen wrapping from one of these scrolls, the Great Isaiah Scroll, was included in a 1955 analysis by Libby, with an estimated age of 1,917 ± 200 years. [...] Based on an analysis of the writing style, palaeographic estimates were made of the age of 21 of the scrolls, and samples from most of these, along with other scrolls which had not been palaeographically dated, were tested by two AMS laboratories in the 1990s. [...] The results ranged in age from the early 4th century BC to the mid 4th century AD. [...] In many cases the scrolls were determined to be older than the palaeographically determined age. [...] The Isaiah scroll was included in the testing and was found to have two possible date ranges at a 2σ confidence level, because of the shape of the <b>calibration</b> <b>curve</b> at that point: there is a 15% chance that it dates from 355–295 BC, and an 84% chance that it dates from 210–45 BC. [...] Subsequently, these dates were criticized on the grounds that before the scrolls were tested, they had been treated with modern castor oil {{in order to make the}} writing easier to read; it was argued that failure to remove the castor oil sufficiently would have caused the dates to be too young. [...] Multiple papers have been published both supporting and opposing the criticism.|$|E
500|$|The above {{calculations}} {{make several}} assumptions, {{such as that}} the level of [...] in the atmosphere has remained constant over time. In fact, the level of [...] in the atmosphere has varied significantly and as a result the values provided by the equation above have to be corrected by using data from other sources. [...] This is done by calibration curves, which convert a measurement of [...] in a sample into an estimated calendar age. [...] The calculations involve several steps and include an intermediate value called the [...] "radiocarbon age", which is the age in [...] "radiocarbon years" [...] of the sample: an age quoted in radiocarbon years means that no <b>calibration</b> <b>curve</b> has been used − the calculations for radiocarbon years assume that the / ratio has not changed over time. [...] Calculating radiocarbon ages also requires the value of the half-life for , which {{for more than a decade}} after Libby's initial work was thought to be 5,568 years. [...] This was revised in the early 1960s to 5,730 years, which meant that many calculated dates in papers published prior to this were incorrect (the error in the half-life is about 3%). [...] For consistency with these early papers, and to avoid the risk of a double correction for the incorrect half-life, radiocarbon ages are still calculated using the incorrect half-life value. [...] A correction for the half-life is incorporated into calibration curves, so even though radiocarbon ages are calculated using a half-life value that is known to be incorrect, the final reported calibrated date, in calendar years, is accurate. [...] When a date is quoted, the reader should be aware that if it is an uncalibrated date (a term used for dates given in radiocarbon years) it may differ substantially from the best estimate of the actual calendar date, both because it uses the wrong value for the half-life of , and because no correction (calibration) has been applied for the historical variation of [...] in the atmosphere over time.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Samples from Tell es-Sultan, Jericho, were {{selected}} for high-precision 14 C dating as a contribution toward {{the establishment of an}} independent radiocarbon chronology of Near Eastern archaeology. The material derives from archaeolog-ical excavations conducted by K. M. Kenyon in the 1950 s. We present here the results of 18 samples, associated stratigraph-ically {{with the end of the}} Middle Bronze Age (MBA) at Tell es-Sultan. Six short-lived samples consist of charred cereal grains and 12 multiyear samples are composed of charcoal. The weighted average 14 C date of the short-lived grains is 3306 ± 7 BP. The multiyear charcoal yielded, as expected, a somewhat older average: 3370 ± 6 BP. Both dates are more precise than the stan-dard deviation (Q) of the <b>calibration</b> <b>curves</b> and the absolute standard of oxalic acid. Calibration of the above Jericho dates is a bit premature, because several groups are currently testing the accuracy of both the 1986 and 1993 <b>calibration</b> <b>curves.</b> Nev-ertheless, preliminary <b>calibration</b> results are presented for comparison, based on 4 different <b>calibration</b> <b>curves</b> and 3 different computer programs.
