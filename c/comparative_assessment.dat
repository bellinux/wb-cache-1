40|$|Recent {{attention}} on the potentiality of cost-effective infrastructures for capturing and processing large amounts of data, known as Big Data has received much attention from researchers and practitioners {{on the field of}} analytics. In this paper we discuss on the possible benefits that Big Data can bring on TEL by using the case of large scale <b>comparative</b> <b>assessments</b> as an example. Large scale <b>comparative</b> <b>assessments</b> can pose as an intrinsic motivational tool for enhancing the performance of both learners and teachers as well as becoming a support tool for policy makers. We argue why data from learning processes can be characterized as Big Data from the viewpoint of data source heterogeneity (variety) and discuss some architectural issues that can be taken into account on implementing such an infrastructure on the case of <b>comparative</b> <b>assessments...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{substitution}} principle {{has been}} included in the EU pesticides legislation as a new element. <b>Comparative</b> <b>assessments</b> will have to be conducted for all uses of plant protection products (PPPs) that contain active substances with certain hazardous properties, the so-called candidates for substitution (CFS). This study investigated the resulting workload {{in terms of the number}} of cases for <b>comparative</b> <b>assessments</b> that regulatory authorities may have to face. The analysis was carried out for Germany as an example.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} {{affected}} uses, {{more or less}} detailed <b>comparative</b> <b>assessments</b> may be required for the 767 different uses of potential candidate products for which at least one alternative product is currently authorised. However, even for the same use, not all candidate products will become subject to authorisation or re-authorisation at the same time. Whenever an authorisation is requested for a single candidate product, <b>comparative</b> <b>assessments</b> {{will have to be}} conducted for all its uses. This means that <b>comparative</b> <b>assessments</b> for the same use may have to be conducted repeatedly over time. Therefore, as an additional indicator of the potential workload for competent authorities, the number of potential candidate products can be multiplied with the average number of uses for which alternatives are potentially available. This yields an indicative figure of roughly 2, 500 cases of use-specific assessments of candidate products that may become necessary during the next years. For the sub-fraction of potential candidate products that contain CFS identified by environmental hazard criteria, the figure is roughly 25 % smaller.|$|R
25|$|The {{strategic}} partnership has {{profited from}} sustained political investments {{made at the}} senior-most levels of decision making. The long-standing relationship between France and India has resulted in extensive co-operation in the domains of aerospace and civil nuclear energy besides military matters. Science and technology cooperation, deep-rooted cultural ties, and a historically francophile literary & fine-arts community in India has provided solid foundations for the strategic relationship. In November 2011, the Foundation for National Security Research in New Delhi published India’s Strategic Partners: A <b>Comparative</b> <b>Assessment</b> and ranked India’s top strategic partners with a score out of 90 points : Russia comes out on top with 62, followed by the United States (58), France (51), UK (41), Germany (37), and Japan (34).|$|E
2500|$|IBC {{illustrated}} {{several of}} what it calls [...] "the main data {{that are relevant to}} a <b>comparative</b> <b>assessment</b> of" [...] the ILCS study and the 2004 Lancet study. It points to, for example, a much larger number of clusters (2,200 for ILCS vs. 33 for Lancet), and a more accurate sampling rate (1 in 200 for ILCS vs. 1 in 3,000 for Lancet). The 2006 Lancet study is somewhat larger than the first (it used 47 clusters instead of 33, and had a lower sampling rate). The 2004 Lancet study surveyed 988 households, and the 2006 Lancet study surveyed 1849 households. The ILCS study surveyed 22,000 households.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{became a}} public figure {{following}} the 1977 Windscale Inquiry into nuclear fuel reprocessing during which he exposed the risks of nuclear waste storage and mounted a successful campaign against radioactive discharges to the marine environment – his work was widely reported in the national press, New Scientist, The Ecologist and the New Internationalist. Between 1980 and 1992 he became an advisor to {{a wide spectrum of}} organisations, ranging from government agencies to environmental NGOs, appearing on TV and radio on issues of nuclear risk and pollution. His work uncovered the health impact of the Windscale Fire in 1957 - in the PERG report RR-7, and in association with Yorkshire TV, the excess of childhood cancers around Sellafield. [...] He served on the government commission into nuclear waste dumping at sea (chaired by Sir Fred Holliday) which recommended the practice be banned. He also sat on a research advisory group on nuclear waste management set up by the Department of Environment – resigning when he felt government were not allowing time for detailed <b>comparative</b> <b>assessment</b> of the options.|$|E

30|$|Estimated case {{numbers in}} this paper {{are based on a}} draft CFS list and on a simplistic static scenario, {{reflecting}} neither fluctuations in the number of authorised products nor any potential future trends. Therefore, the figures should not be taken as precise estimates but rather as indications of the expectable dimension of the upcoming demands on <b>comparative</b> <b>assessments.</b> In any case, {{the results of the present}} study indicate that several thousands of cases might need to be evaluated. Hence, the new task of performing <b>comparative</b> <b>assessments</b> of PPPs may pose a formidable challenge to competent authorities. Not only are the quantitative demands considerable, the established assessment methodologies for PPPs and the existing organisational arrangements are also only designed for checking compliance of individual PPPs with legal acceptability criteria. They were not developed for comparing products with each other. New data handling systems, assessment procedures, and decision rules might hence be required for efficiently dealing with the new task.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In the multi-attribute utility theory {{the utility}} {{functions}} are usually constructed by dots. It concerns both the lottery’s method {{and the value}} increasing method. In the both cases the utility function is constructed in the absolute scale [0, 1] that causes inconveniences for experts. The <b>comparative</b> <b>assessments</b> look more preferable for decision-makers. The paired comparison matrix (PCM) looks as a natural model representing the preference structure of decision-maker (DM). We use scale points of attributes as a PCM comparative entities. We use also increasing/decreasing entity priority as a criterion. Function of priorities is transformed to utility function {{on the base of}} a normalizing function. Such a function allows using the matrix power as parameter affecting the form of utility function. The PCM provides the extended possibilities to DMs to form <b>comparative</b> <b>assessments</b> both the qualitative ones (as better-worse) and the quantitative ones reflecting winnings and losses of DMs. In the paper we consider methods for utility function construction having different forms of its presentation. Among them there are utility functions based on attributes measured in nominal scales...|$|R
