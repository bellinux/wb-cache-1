50|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} in M. tuberculosis typically occurs due {{to either the}} accumulation of mutations in the genes targeted by the antibiotic or a change in titration of the drug. M. tuberculosis {{is considered to be}} multidrug-resistant (MDR TB) if it has developed drug resistance to both rifampicin and isoniazid, which are the most important antibiotics used in treatment. Additionally, extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis (XDR TB) is characterized by resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin, plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or <b>capreomycin).</b>|$|E
50|$|XDR-TB {{is defined}} as TB that has {{developed}} resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid (resistance to these first line anti-TB drugs defines Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, or MDR-TB), {{as well as to}} any member of the quinolone family and {{at least one of the}} following second-line anti-TB injectable drugs: kanamycin, <b>capreomycin,</b> or amikacin.

50|$|XDR TB is {{very similar}} to MDR, but is {{significantly}} more rare. The difference is purely in the number of resistances the TB has had a chance (or the luck) to develop, and is transmitted either by exposure to someone with XDR TB or by incorrectly taking medications prescribed to combat MDR TB. XDR TB bacteria have changed enough to circumvent the two best antibiotics, INH and RIF, as well as most of the alternative drugs used against MDR TB. These second-line drugs include any fluoroquinolone, and {{at least one of the}} other three injectable anti-TB drugs: amikacin, kanamycin, or <b>capreomycin.</b> To cure this tuberculosis requires two years of medication.|$|E
5000|$|Viomycin is {{a member}} of the tuberactinomycin family, a group of nonribosomal peptide {{antibiotics}} exhibiting anti-tuberculosis properties.

It is produced by the actinomycete Streptomyces puniceus, that binds to RNA and inhibits prokaryotic protein synthesis and certain forms of RNA splicing.|$|E
50|$|Almost one in {{four people}} in the world is {{infected}} with TB bacteria. Only when the bacteria become active do people become ill with TB. Bacteria become active as a result of anything that can reduce the person’s immunity, such as HIV, advancing age, or some medical conditions. TB can usually be treated with a course of four standard, or first-line, anti-TB drugs (i.e., isoniazid, rifampin and any fluoroquinolone). If these drugs are misused or mismanaged, multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) can develop. MDR-TB takes longer to treat with second-line drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or <b>capreomycin),</b> which are more expensive and have more side-effects. XDR-TB can develop when these second-line drugs are also misused or mismanaged and therefore also become ineffective.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{are limited}} {{data about the}} {{epidemiology}} and treatment-related outcomes associated with <b>capreomycin</b> resistance in patients with XDR-TB. <b>Capreomycin</b> achieves high serum concentrations relative to MIC but whether <b>capreomycin</b> has therapeutic benefit despite microbiological resistance remains unclear. METHODS: We reviewed the susceptibility profiles and outcomes associated with <b>capreomycin</b> usage in patients diagnosed with XDR-TB between August 2002 and October 2012 in two provinces of South Africa. Patients whose isolates were genotypically tested for <b>capreomycin</b> resistance {{were included in the}} analysis. RESULTS: Of 178 XDR-TB patients 41 % were HIV-infected. 87 % (154 / 178) isolates contained a <b>capreomycin</b> resistance-conferring mutation [80 % (143 / 178) rrs A 1401 G and 6 % (11 / 178) were heteroresistant (containing both the rrs A 1401 G mutation and wild-type sequences) ]. Previous MDR-TB treatment, prior usage of kanamycin, or strain type was not associated with <b>capreomycin</b> resistance. 92 % (163 / 178) of XDR-TB patients were empirically treated with <b>capreomycin.</b> <b>Capreomycin</b> resistance decreased the odds of sputum culture conversion. In <b>capreomycin</b> sensitive and resistant persons combined weight at diagnosis was the only independent predictor for survival (p=< 0. 001). By contrast, HIV status and use of co-amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were independent predictors of mortality (p=< 0. 05). <b>Capreomycin</b> usage was not associated with survival or culture conversion when the analysis was restricted to those whose isolates were resistant to <b>capreomycin.</b> CONCLUSION: In South Africa the frequency of <b>capreomycin</b> conferring mutations was extremely high in XDR-TB isolates. In those with <b>capreomycin</b> resistance there appeared to be no therapeutic benefit of using <b>capreomycin.</b> These data inform susceptibility testing and the design of treatment regimens for XDR-TB in TB endemic settings...|$|E
40|$|The {{pulmonary}} {{route is}} one of the main strategies investigated to improve tuberculosis therapy. The aim of this study was to develop a simple and scalable method to produce <b>capreomycin</b> inhalable powders to use as supergeneric. In vitro antimycobacterial activity and in vivo acute toxicity were assessed using agar proportion susceptibility test on Mycobacterium tuberculosis and chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay, respectively. <b>Capreomycin</b> and three different hydrophobic counterions, namely oleate, linoleate, and linolenate, were combined in solution to obtain hydrophobic ion-pairs that were successively spray-dried. Ion-pairing efficiency was influenced by the spray-dryer employed to produce the powder. In the case of <b>capreomycin</b> oleate, both instruments, mini and nano spray-dryer, were suitable to maintain a high ion-paired content, while for <b>capreomycin</b> linoleate and linolenate, mini spray-dryer was the most appropriate instrument. The three formulations showed morphology and particle sizes potentially suitable for inhalation. <b>Capreomycin</b> oleate and linoleate showed the same efficacy of <b>capreomycin</b> sulfate against M. tuberculosis, while <b>capreomycin</b> linolenate showed a reduced efficacy, even though strain growth was inhibited at 10 (- 4) mycobacterial inoculum. In vivo acute toxicity studies evidenced the lowest toxic potential for <b>capreomycin</b> oleate when compared to the single components or the other two salts. Overall, <b>capreomycin</b> oleate seems to possess the most promising characteristics to be used as supergenerics in pulmonary tuberculosis treatment...|$|E

40|$|<b>Capreomycin</b> was {{incorporated}} into multilamellar vesicles of pure dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. The pharmacokinetics and nephrotoxicity of <b>capreomycin</b> in the free and liposomal forms were studied in normal mice. The efficacies of the two forms were evaluated by using the Mycobacterium avium complex beige mouse model. Approximately 10 (7) viable M. avium cells were injected intravenously. Seven days later, treatment with either liposomal or free <b>capreomycin</b> at 60 or 120 mg/kg of body weight was administered daily for 5 days. Mice were sacrificed 5 days {{after the end of}} treatment, and the viable bacteria in liver, spleen, lungs, and blood were counted. After 5 days of treatment with dosages of 60 or 120 mg/kg/day, the level of blood urea nitrogen increased in the group treated with free <b>capreomycin</b> but not in the group treated with liposomal <b>capreomycin.</b> After intravenous injection of 120 mg/kg, liposomes enhanced the diffusion of <b>capreomycin</b> in the spleen, lungs, and kidneys and increased the half-life in serum. The 120 -mg/kg dose of liposomal <b>capreomycin</b> significantly reduced the number of viable mycobacteria in the liver, spleen, and blood compared with those in the controls. Although these results are promising, further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of liposomal <b>capreomycin</b> for the treatment of M. avium complex infections...|$|E

40|$|<b>Capreomycin</b> is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), but it is limited therapeutically by its severe side effects. The objectives of the present studies were (i) to design low-density porous <b>capreomycin</b> sulfate particles for efficient pulmonary delivery to improve local and systemic drug bioavailability and capacity to reduce the bacillary load in the lungs {{in a manner similar to}} that achieved with intramuscular injections; (ii) to determine pharmacokinetic parameters after pulmonary administration of these <b>capreomycin</b> particles; and (iii) to evaluate the efficacy of these particles in treating animals in a small-aerosol-inoculum guinea pig model of TB. <b>Capreomycin</b> particles were manufactured by spray drying and characterized in terms of size and drug content. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental methods with healthy guinea pigs after administration of <b>capreomycin</b> particles by insufflation. The efficacy of the particles was evaluated by histopathological analysis and in terms of wet organ weight and bacterial burden in TB-infected animals. Lungs of animals receiving a 14. 5 -mg/kg dose of <b>capreomycin</b> particles showed significantly lower wet weights and smaller bacterial burdens than those of animals receiving any other treatment. These results were supported by histopathological analysis. The feasibility of inhaling <b>capreomycin</b> in a novel powder form, with the ultimate objective of the treatment of MDR-TB, is demonstrated by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies with guinea pigs. If applied to humans with MDR-TB, such a therapeutic approach might simplify drug delivery by eliminating injections and might reduce adverse effects through lowering the dose...|$|E
