Soeriaatmadja later recalled that the most difficult scenes to shoot were those which happened in modern times, especially the riots; for set design, however, Indra Tamoron Musu found those that occurred in the past to be the most difficult, owing to the research necessary. The scenes at the house were shot separately; those occurring in 1998 were shot first and those occurring in the past were shot after the crew had spent a week renovating the house. Hasiholan later recalled that Soeriaatmadja was a <b>controlling</b> <b>director</b> who told the actors exactly what he wanted in a clear manner. However, cinematographer Ical Tanjung said that Soeriaatmadja was still open to feedback from the cast and crew. Editing, which was done by Waluyo Ichwandiardono, took another three months.|$|E

50|$|Baya, {{a trophy}} wife, {{is the most}} glamorous of the contestants but also the most dubious entry, living in luxury with her adopted {{children}} almost as uninterested in the contest prize as Lizi, participating {{at the insistence of}} her mother who is determined to thrust her daughter into the limelight. The only thing they share in common is their reluctance and dismay at the tacky turns the contest takes as at what at first seems hopeful, gradually loses the glitter and the gold under the slow realization that the competition is an exploitative farce with its cold <b>controlling</b> <b>director</b> Otar keen to exploit anything that secures lucrative ratings. Tragic tales of war and poverty are woven in to entertain the audience using the very real tragedies that have befallen the contestants with also the paparazzi and sexual favors entering the mix as well. As conflicts heighten, the competition gradually turns sour behind the scenes with Otar eager to maintain complete control by bullying and humiliating anyone failing to fall in line.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{provides}} an empirical analysis of box office performance for movies produced in Italy between 1985 and 1996. Descriptive evidence documents {{a decrease in}} the total number of films produced and a sharp reduction in daily revenues and per screen daily admissions during the sample period. In the econometric analysis various alternative hypotheses on the impact of the ex ante popularity of directors and cast of actors on box office performances are rejected in favour of a quadratic specification with positive externalities between the two factors. The econometric cross-sectional evidence also documents that the net impact of subsidies on total admissions is irrelevant and that the significantly lower performance of subsidised films depends on the lower ex ante popularity of their cast and directors. Results on the impact of specialisation genres and production houses show that very few of them (i. e., the comic specialisation genre and the Filmauro production house) have a significant marginal impact on box office performances after <b>controlling</b> <b>director</b> and actors effects.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a broad {{history of the}} Irish Press during the years 1919 - 1948. It sets forth how, from 1919 onwards, Republican leader Eamon de Valera became convinced {{of the need for}} a newspaper sympathetic to his aims, and how he went about raising funds for the enterprise both in Ireland and the United States. The corporate structure of the Irish Press is also examined, with particular emphasis {{on the role of the}} <b>Controlling</b> <b>Director</b> and the influence of the Irish Press American Corporation. The Irish Press was first published in 1931, and the thesis examines its support for Fianna Fail in the period under study. The work also examines the changes in the relationship between the party and the paper as Fianna Fail became more entrenched in government. The role of the first editor of the Irish Press. Frank Gallagher, is considered. The changes in the attitude of the Irish Press to Fianna Fail in the post-Gallagher period are also examined, with emphasis on the findings of the Fianna Fail sub-committee on publicity. The thesis concludes that the period under review was characterised by the emergence of four key elements in the culture of the Irish Press: volatile industrial relations climate, fund-raising problems, links to Fianna Fail, and a corporate structure which ensured dynastic control by the de Valera family...|$|E
