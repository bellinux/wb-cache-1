The {{results showed that}} among two groups of samples with laser surface remelted-strengthening, C 2 group samples of higher laser power and quicker linear speed had higher wear-resistance, and № 6 sample of C 2 group has the best with 1. 5 mm beam diameter, 240 - 250 W power and 30 mm/s linear speed, its total wear extent of three work conditions was only 16. 3 mg, and its wear-resistance increased 34. 8 % compared with № 3 sample which had the best wear-resistance in C 1 group without laser surface remelted-strengthening,; and for contrast of average wear-resistance of three work conditions, C 2 group increased 49. 3 % compared with C 1 group, it was showed {{that the effect of}} laser surface remelted-strengthening on high NiCr indefinite <b>chilled</b> <b>iron</b> <b>roll</b> material were very evident...|$|E
40|$|Large <b>chilled</b> <b>iron</b> mill <b>rolls</b> {{fabricated}} by permanent-mold gravity {{suffer from}} surface macroscopic cracking during iron solidification. This defect is usually intermittent over time, {{and in some}} extent, unrelated with the chemical composition and the process parameters used. To study this phenomenon, a metallographic analysis {{has been carried out}} on two real 5. 5 -ton <b>chilled</b> <b>iron</b> mill <b>rolls</b> made of the same chemical composition, manufactured with quite similar process parameters, but giving two very different results in practice: one of the two mill rolls exhibited a macroscopic crack. Because of the different metallurgical structures observed, especially regarding graphite content, a three-dimensional (3 D) numerical analysis has been adopted to predict the thermal-mechanical behavior of the casting during the solidification and cooling stages. Special attention has been dedicated to the influence of the graphite expansion on mechanical stresses occurring in the casting skin. Numerical results point out that graphite expansion notably affects the evolution of stress-strain fields within the casting to an extent that it could lead to the formation of macroscopic cracks {{in the early stages of}} the casting solidification. Furthermore, the numerical analysis highlights that the thermal deformation of the permanent mold contributes to increase the risk of cracks to occu...|$|R

Despite the differences in chemical composition and microstructure, the tribological response of the different work roll materials was found to be strongly dependent on the material microstructure and especially the presence and distribution of microstructural constituents, such as the different carbide phases and graphite (in the case of Indefinite <b>Chill</b> <b>Iron).</b> Cracking and chipping of the work roll surfaces, both having a negative impact on work roll wear, are strongly influenced by the presence of carbides, carbide networks and graphite in the work roll surface.

For example, {{features of the}} grain structure are revealed in different kind of steel on microstruc ture level, and its parameters greatly influences on the strength properties of the metal. Thus, to select the scale of representation of a fractal object, for instance the elements of structure of <b>roll</b> <b>iron</b> or steel is necessary to determine the interval (1), where observed its self-similarity, and on this interval should be selected the scale, the use of which will allow him to choose adequate fractal dimension. For optimal scale structure of repose is taken one in which at least two adjacent points of the series (2), the fractal dimension is minimal differences between them. This is explained by the fact that this is best observed property of self-similarity structure.

40|$|Some {{properties}} of the rolls depend on the ratio of columnar structure area to equiaxed structure area created during roll solidification. The transition is fundamental phenomenon that can be apply to characterize massive cast <b>iron</b> <b>rolls</b> produced by the casting house. As {{the first step of}} simulation, a temperature field for solidifying cast <b>iron</b> <b>roll</b> was created. The convection in the liquid is not comprised since in the first approximation, the convection does not influence the studied occurrence of the (columnar to equiaxed grains) transition in the roll. The obtained temperature field allows to study the dynamics of its behavior observed {{in the middle of the}} mould thickness. This midpoint of the mould thickness was treated as an operating point for the transition. A full accumulation of the heat in the mould was postulated for the transition. Thus, a plateau at the curve was observed at the midpoint. The range of the plateau existence corresponded to the incubation period, that appeared before fully equiaxed grains formation. At the second step of simulation, behavior of the thermal gradients field was studied. Three ranges within the filed were visible: EC→EC→EC→EC→) (tTECtt↔RERCtt↔a/ for the formation of columnar structure (the C – zone) : (and 0 >>T& 0 >>=− >−=REREttGttG). The columnar structure formation was significantly slowed down during incubation period. It resulted from a competition between columnar growth and equiaxed growth expected at that period of time. The 0 ≈=−=RERCttGttG relationship was postulated to correspond well with the critical thermal gradient, known in the Hunt’s theory. A simulation was performed for the cast <b>iron</b> <b>rolls</b> solidifying as if in industrial condition.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{highlights}} {{a surface}} modification technique {{to evaluate the}} mechanical properties like hardness and sliding wear resistance of cast Iron surface used in engineering. Basic sand casting mold was used and a portion of {{it was designed to}} accommodate the external mild steel chill (MSC). Chill accelerates the cooling rate of molten metal which leads to directional solidification. Cooling rate is directly proportional to formation of carbides in the form of iron carbide (Fe 3 C) near the chill end By controlling the flow of liquid nitrogen, the temperature of chills was reduced (upto - 100 °C). Effect of using chills on mechanical properties like hardness and sliding wear resistance was evaluated and analyzed. The present work provides the effective chilling thickness, which gives higher hardness near the chilled surface and a fairly appreciable hardness conducive for a specific wear functional requirement. The mechanical properties of <b>chilled</b> cast <b>iron</b> (CCI) is compared with sub zero <b>chilled</b> cast <b>iron</b> (SZCCI) and normal cast <b>iron</b> without using <b>chill.</b> The present results clearly demonstrates that <b>chilled</b> cast <b>iron</b> has superior sliding wear resistance at the chilled surface, good machinibility away from the chilled end...|$|R
