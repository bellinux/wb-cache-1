5|$|Although {{specimens}} of M.griveaudi differ by only 0.6% in their cytb sequences, analysis of D-loop data does show some differentiation between the island populations. These {{data suggest that}} the species originated on Madagascar, where a large, stable population persists, and independently colonized Grande Comore and Anjouan; subsequently, the Grande Comore and Anjouan populations <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact,</b> resulting in inter-island gene flow.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton's birthplace on {{the island}} of Nevis had a large Jewish community, constituting one quarter of Charlestown's white {{population}} by the 1720s. He <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> with Jews on a regular basis; as a small boy, he was tutored by a Jewish schoolmistress, and had learned to recite the Ten Commandments in the original Hebrew.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> with Thomas Clarkson and a {{group of}} anti-slave-trade activists, {{including}} Granville Sharp, Hannah More and Charles Middleton. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he soon became one of the leading English abolitionists. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807.|$|E

5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> {{with the land}} surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both {{the flow of water}} and the types of vegetation that can take hold.|$|E
5|$|Conroy {{effectively}} barred Victoria {{from anyone}} other than the Duchess or his relatives and the princess was prevented from becoming close to her extended family. The enforced isolation meant the only companions of her own age whom she frequently <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> with were Conroy's daughters, who included Victoire, a girl a few months older than Victoria. Victoria {{does not appear to}} have been fond of either Conroy sister as there is little positive comment in her personal journals.|$|E

5|$|In 121 BC, Rome <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> {{with two}} Celtic tribes (from a region in modern France), {{both of which}} they {{defeated}} with apparent ease. The Cimbrian War (113–101 BC) was a far more serious affair than the earlier clashes of 121 BC. The Germanic tribes of the Cimbri and the Teutons migrated from northern Europe into Rome's northern territories, and clashed with Rome and her allies. At the Battle of Aquae Sextiae and the Battle of Vercellae both tribes were virtually annihilated, which ended the threat.|$|E
5|$|Memories of {{the sack}} of Rome by Celtic tribes from Gaul in 390/387 BC, {{had been made}} into a legendary account that was taught to each {{generation}} of Roman youth, were still prominent despite their historical distance.

In 1798, his father took him to Kathmandu and enrolled him as a bodyguard to the king. In Kathmandu, Bhimsen took up residence at Thapathali Durbar, after which he lived in Bagh Durbar near Tundikhel after becoming a kaji (equivalent to a minister).|$|E

As such, the list of the known hideaways is not representative; the majority of the Robinsons died while in hiding, and hence their identities, were never recorded.

5|$|After {{attending}} a public celebration of HSS leader Vladko Maček's birthday on 20 June 1935, Blažeković was imprisoned by Yugoslav authorities and tortured for twelve {{days in a}} prison {{on the island of}} Korčula. He was subsequently taken to Dubrovnik and charged with conspiring against the Yugoslav state, but was not convicted. In 1939, he joined the Ustaše, a Croatian fascist organization which advocated armed struggle in achieving Croatia's independence from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During this period, he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> with the fascist leader Slavko Kvaternik. From late 1940 to early 1941, Blažeković was pursued by Yugoslav authorities because of his association with the Ustaše and hid in Zagreb to avoid capture.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of Belgium in September 1944, there was a boom of new {{magazines}} for the youth, both in French and Dutch. Many of those tried to mix American comics with local artists. Vandersteen worked in these early years for countless publications. He continued publishing in Bravo, with the medieval gags of Lancelot. Having moved to the suburbs of Brussels to avoid the bombardments of Antwerp, he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> with some French language editors. French language magazines he contributed to included Franc Jeu, Perce-Neige, and Le Petit Monde. Two of the comics he created for Franc Jeu were also published in albums. By 1947, all these magazines had disappeared.|$|E

5|$|Belgrano {{completed}} his first {{studies at the}} San Carlos school, where he learned Latin, philosophy, logic, physics, metaphysics, and literature; he graduated in 1786. Domingo had sufficient success as merchant to send his two sons Francisco and Manuel to study in Europe. He expected them to study commerce, but Manuel decided to study law. Belgrano was so successful and attained such prestige that Pope Pius VI allowed him to study forbidden literature, even books deemed as heretical, excepting only the astrological and obscene books. In this way he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> with authors like Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Filangieri, who were forbidden in Spain.|$|E
5|$|Composite bows {{were soon}} adopted and adapted by civilizations who <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> with nomads, {{such as the}} Chinese, Assyrian, and Egyptian. Several {{composite}} bows {{were found in the}} tomb of Tutankhamun, who died in 1324 BCE. Composite bows (and chariots) are known in China from at least the Shang Dynasty (1700–1100 BCE). We have strong indications to believe that Bronze Age Greek Cultures like the Minoans and the Mycenaeans were using composite bows in a large scale. By the 4th century BCE, chariotry had ceased to have military importance, replaced by cavalry everywhere (except in Britannia where charioteers are not recorded as using bows).|$|E
5|$|Eusebio Joaquín González {{was born}} on August 14, 1896 in Colotlán, Jalisco. At a young age, he joined the Constitutional Army during the Mexican Revolution. While he was on leave in 1920, he met Elisa Flores, whom he later married. While {{stationed}} {{in the state of}} Coahuila in 1926, he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> with Saulo and Silas, two ascetic preachers from the Iglesia Cristiana Espiritual. Their teachings forbade their followers to keep good hygiene and wear regular clothes. After being baptized by the two itinerant preachers, González resigned from the army, and along with his wife became domestic workers to the two preachers.|$|E

Her uncle (Martin Lister) was a prominent naturalist. Richard Jennings <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> with James, Duke of York (the future James II, brother of King Charles II), in 1663, during negotiations for the recovery of an estate in Kent (Agney Court) that had been the property of his mother-in-law, Susan Lister (nee Temple). James's first impressions were favourable, and in 1664 Sarah’s sister, Frances, was appointed maid of honour to the Duchess of York, Anne Hyde.|$|E
5|$|In 1570, El Greco {{moved to}} Rome, where he {{executed}} {{a series of}} works strongly marked by his Venetian apprenticeship. It is unknown how long he remained in Rome, though he may have returned to Venice (c. 1575–76) {{before he left for}} Spain. In Rome, on the recommendation of Giulio Clovio, El Greco was received as a guest at the Palazzo Farnese, which Cardinal Alessandro Farnese had made a center of the artistic and intellectual life of the city. There he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> with the intellectual elite of the city, including the Roman scholar Fulvio Orsini, whose collection would later include seven paintings by the artist (View of Mt. Sinai and a portrait of Clovio are among them).|$|E

In 1956, a few months after his release from prison, he received military training in Cairo. He also studied architectural engineering at the University of Alexandria, but he did not graduate. Al-Wazir was detained once again in 1957 for leading raids against Israel and was exiled to Saudi Arabia, finding work as a schoolteacher. He continued to teach after moving to Kuwait in 1959.|$|E
