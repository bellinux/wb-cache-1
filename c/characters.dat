The <b>characters</b> that Kishimoto developed, however, were praised for incorporating many of the better aspects of previous shōnen <b>characters,</b> although many publications lamented the perceived lack of growth beyond such stereotypes. The visual presentation of the <b>characters</b> was commented on by reviewers, with both praise and criticism given to Kishimoto's work in the manga and anime adaptations.|$|E

After the <b>characters</b> from the series were created, they were all shown to executive producer Steven Spielberg, who would decide which <b>characters</b> would make it into Animaniacs (the <b>characters</b> Buttons and Mindy were chosen by Spielberg's daughter).

These <b>character</b> traits can be understood as a syndrome resulting from a particular <b>character</b> orientation.
