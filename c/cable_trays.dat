25|$|In 2005, {{the problem}} of foam shed had not been fully cured; on STS-114, {{additional}} cameras mounted on the tank recorded a piece of foam separated from one of its Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramps, which are designed to prevent unsteady air flow underneath the tank’s <b>cable</b> <b>trays</b> and pressurization lines during ascent. The PAL ramps consist of manually sprayed layers of foam, {{and are more likely}} to become a source of debris. That piece of foam did not impact the orbiter.|$|E
25|$|The {{segments}} {{of each of}} the two deck spans will be retained in compression during a severe earthquake by post-tensioned internal tendons joining the extreme end caps, carried internally in <b>cable</b> <b>trays.</b> These tendons are required since the eastern end support is both much lighter than the western counterweight and the soil conditions are radically different at each end, the western end being founded in bedrock shale while the eastern end, with vertical supports driven to bedrock, is mostly contained within softer mud deposits, which respond much more actively to seismic shocks than does the shale. The intent is that the combination of the tensioned tendons and the compressive roadbed box structure will keep the two end caps in the same relative position.|$|E

This has been proven by the German Otto-Graf-Institut Test Report III.1-80999/Tei/tei [...] "Supplementary Test On The Topic Of Mechanical Force Acting On Cable Penetration Firestop Systems During The Fire Test", dated 23 October 1984, to dislodge [...] "soft" [...] firestops, such as those made of fibrous insulations with rubber coatings. This also applies to any silicone foam seals, but is easily remedied {{through the use of}} firestop mortars of sufficient compression strength and thickness, as shown above. Also, some building codes mandate that penetrants such as <b>cable</b> <b>trays</b> are installed in such ways so as to avoid their contribution to the collapse of a firewall.|$|E
