There's a certain {{red-headed}} imp in this neighborhood who {{is the daughter of}} our assistant chief, John O'Gorman. Her name is Josie O'Gorman and she's in training for the same profession of which I'm an ornament. I won't sneer at her, for she's clever, in a way, but I'd like to show O'Gorman that Nan Shelley--that's my name in Washington--is a little more clever than his pet. This Josie O'Gorman is staying with the Hathaway family. She's been probing your secret life and business enterprises and has unearthed an important clew in which the department is bound to be interested. So she sent a <b>code</b> <b>telegram</b> to O'Gorman, who left it on his desk long enough for me to decipher and read it. I don't know what the assistant chief will do about it, for I left Washington an hour later and came straight to you. What I do know is that I'm in time to spike Miss Josie's guns, which will give me a great deal of pleasure. She doesn't know I'm your daughter, any more than O'Gorman does, so if the girl sees me here she'll imagine I'm on Government business. But I want to keep out of her way for a time. Do you know the girl, Dad?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Many {{international}} broadcasters (television or radio) {{can reach}} [...] "unreachable" [...] audiences via email and RSS feeds. This {{is not at}} all unusual, as the first commonly agreed international broadcast was a Morse <b>Code</b> <b>telegram</b> transmitted from US President Wilson to the German Kaiser (mid-1918) via a high powered longwave transmitter on the US East Coast (this important event in international broadcasting history was described in depth in the IEEE [...] "The History of International Broadcasting" [...] first volume). As Morse Code {{is considered to be a}} data format, with email and RSS merely being refinements of the technology it can be said that international broadcasting has a deep relationship with modern-day datacasting.|$|E

5000|$|The Commonwealth and States {{needed to}} {{cooperate}} {{to manage the}} war effort. On 6 August 1914, the Australian Agent-General in London sent a <b>coded</b> <b>telegram</b> to the Federal government: [...] "Home Government will tonight accept offer of Australian contingent ... Shall endeavour to arrange for steamer carrying troops to also bring meat". The supply of meat was a state matter while the mobilisation {{of the armed forces}} was a Commonwealth issue. Here they were entwined seamlessly.|$|R
500|$|Elections to [...] "People's Assemblies" [...] {{were held}} in all three states in mid-July; the Soviet-sponsored slates {{received}} between 92.2% and 99.2% of the vote. During June, John Cooper Wiley of the State Department sent <b>coded</b> <b>telegrams</b> to Washington reporting developments in the Baltics, and these reports influenced Welles. The U.S. responded with a July 15 amendment to Executive Order 8389 that froze {{the assets of the}} Baltic states, thereby grouping them with German-occupied countries, and by issuing the condemnatory Welles declaration.|$|R
50|$|Boztayev made huge {{contribution}} in industrial development of East-Kazakhstan and Semipalatinsk regions. One of the first, he exclaimed against continuation {{of nuclear weapons}} tests o Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test site (<b>coded</b> <b>telegram</b> to Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR addressed to M.S. Gorbachev, 20 February 1989), {{which was the first}} official document for stopping nuclear tests. Despite the resistance of military-industrial complex of USSR, which supported continuation of nuclear tests, Boztayev consistently and persistently pursued policy for ending tests {{for two and a half}} years.|$|R
50|$|On 20 September 1941, Sir Harry Luke, high {{commissioner}} of the western Pacific, sent Gallagher a <b>coded</b> <b>telegram</b> with word {{he was about to}} be promoted as secretary to government and reposted on Ocean Island, but Gallagher didn't reply to the polite query asking for his thoughts on this. That day he had fallen seriously ill at sea with tropical sprue, an infection sometimes aggravated by poor nutrition which interferes with the small intestine's ability to absorb nutrients, resulting in symptoms related to malnutrition.|$|R
50|$|Early codes were {{typically}} compilations of phrases and corresponding codewords numbering {{in the tens}} of thousands. Codewords were chosen to be pronounceable words to minimize errors by telegraphers, and telegrams composed of non-pronounceable words cost significantly more. Regulations of the International Telegraph Union evolved over time; in 1879, it mandated <b>coded</b> <b>telegrams</b> only contain words from German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, or Latin, but commercial codes already frequently used nonsense words. By 1903 regulations were changed to allow any pronounceable word no more than ten letters long.|$|R
5000|$|An early {{symbol of}} Rice's {{athletic}} teams was large canvas owl, a tempting target for Rice Institute's rivals. In 1917, when students from Southwest Conference football rival Texas A&M kidnapped the owl, Rice students pooled their resources and hired {{a private detective}} to go to College Station to find the missing mascot. Upon recovering the owl, the detective sent a <b>coded</b> <b>telegram</b> to Houston that read [...] "Sammy is fairly well {{and would like to}} see his parents at eleven o'clock," [...] giving the mascot a name for the first time.|$|R
25|$|After PAEC {{officials}} clearing with Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, {{the preparations}} and logistics matters {{were given to}} the Pakistan Armed Forces. A secretly <b>coded</b> <b>telegram</b> was sent from the Prime Minister's Secretariat to V Corps Brigadier Muhammad Sarfraz. A helicopter, was arranged for the civilian scientists by Sarfraz. In 1977, Sarfraz was dispatched to the Military Engineering Service to commission engineering formations of the Pakistan military by General Zia-ul-Haq, the Chief of Army Staff. The PAEC officials readily agreed that the secondary tests would be scientific in nature with the armed forces playing the engineering roles.|$|R
50|$|Lindemans was {{released}} on Tuesday, 19 September, {{one day after the}} Allies entered Eindhoven by Baker who was absolutely furious that one of his best agents was detained, Kooy produced the items discovered, Baker's reply that the newspaper meant nothing and the pass was a fake. On 23 September, Lindemans was debriefed and cleared of any suspicion by Captain de Graff (A <b>coded</b> <b>telegram</b> was sent to the BI HQ in London noting that Lindemans was all right) and Captain de Jong who had recently arrived from England and who was also serving on Prince Bernhard's Staff.|$|R
5|$|Lenin never {{witnessed}} {{this violence}} or {{participated in it}} first-hand, and publicly distanced himself from it. His published articles and speeches rarely called for executions, but he regularly did so in his <b>coded</b> <b>telegrams</b> and confidential notes. Many Bolsheviks expressed disapproval of the Cheka's mass executions and feared the organisation's apparent unaccountability. The Party tried to restrain its activities in February 1919, stripping it of its powers of tribunal and execution in those areas not under official martial law, but the Cheka continued as before in swathes of the country. By 1920, the Cheka had become the most powerful institution in Soviet Russia, exerting influence over all other state apparatus.|$|R

The message was sent to the German ambassador to Mexico, Heinrich von Eckardt. Zimmermann sent the telegram in anticipation of the [...] by Germany on 1 February, an act the German government presumed would almost certainly lead to war with the United States. The telegram instructed Ambassador Eckardt that if the United States appeared certain to enter the war, he was to approach the Mexican Government with a proposal for military alliance with funding from Germany.|$|R
50|$|In May 1878, the House of Representatives {{created a}} special {{committee}} charged with investigating {{the allegations of}} fraud in the 1876 election. The eleven-member committee was chaired by Clarkson Nott Potter, a Democratic congressman from New York. The committee, however, could not uncover any evidence of wrongdoing by the President. At approximately the same time, the New York Tribune published a series of <b>coded</b> <b>telegrams</b> that Democratic Party operatives had sent during the weeks following the 1876 election. These telegrams revealed attempts to bribe election officials in states with disputed results. Despite attempts to implicate him in the scandal, Samuel Tilden was declared innocent by the Potter Committee.|$|R

5000|$|Already in November 1939, Lithuanian diplomats {{presented}} a memorandum to President Antanas Smetona suggesting several reforms that, {{in case of}} an emergency, would enable them to form a government in exile and continue to perform diplomatic functions with limited interruptions. However, the only change was a <b>coded</b> <b>telegram</b> number 288, variously dated from May 30 to June 3, 1940, from Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Urbšys that in case of a [...] "catastrophe" [...] Stasys Lozoraitis, Minister Plenipotentiary in Rome, was appointed as the chief of diplomacy. Petras Klimas in Paris and Jurgis Šaulys in Bern were appointed as Lozoraitis' deputies. Therefore, the diplomats were caught unprepared and disorganized when Lithuania lost its independence.|$|R

50|$|Hassard died at {{his home}} on East 18th Street in Manhattan of {{consumption}} on April 18, 1888, after nine years of illness. He had attempted to cure himself by spending time in England, the West Indies, the South of France, Southern California, and especially the Adirondacks at Saranac Lake, {{but it was not}} apparent that he was seriously ill until shortly before he died. A number of sources attribute the breakdown of his health to the strain of attempting to decipher <b>coded</b> <b>telegrams</b> between the Democratic Party and their operatives in the Southern states during the 1876 presidential election. Hassard was able to decode them with Colonel William M. Grosvenor, prompting a Congressional investigation into whether electoral votes had been purchased.|$|R

60|$|Much of {{the growing}} {{situation}} was veiled to the three figures of it. Graham {{did not know of}} Paula's desperate efforts to cling close to her husband, who, himself desperately busy with his thousand plans and projects, was seeing less and less of his company. He always appeared at lunch, but it was a rare afternoon when he could go out with his guests. Paula did know, from the multiplicity of long, <b>code</b> <b>telegrams</b> from Mexico, that things were in a parlous state with the Harvest Group. Also, she saw the agents and emissaries of foreign investors in Mexico, always in haste and often inopportune, arriving at the ranch to confer with Dick. Beyond his complaint that they ate the heart out of his time, he gave her no clew to the matters discussed.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the inquiry}} Wood {{presented}} {{copies of a}} series of <b>coded</b> <b>telegrams</b> written by Overheu. Nairn objected to Wood making private telegrams public but Wood overruled him as they [...] "show that one member of the police party interested himself considerably in getting the defence worked up". The telegrams revealed a network of communication between the [...] "interested parties", local fund raising for the defence that had raised more than ₤1,000 ($68,000 in 2009 dollars) and detailed the [...] "conspiracy" [...] of Gribble organising the killing of Nulla Nulla cattle by mission Aboriginals, giving details of how it was done that Wood found barely credible. More to the point, the telegrams revealed Overheu's hatred of Aborigines, a view supported by a statement to Detective Sergeant Manning by Lyddie, that it was Overhue who continually urged the police to kill the prisoners.|$|R
5000|$|Major Thomas {{argued that}} the killings of Boer commandos were {{justified}} because the men {{were part of an}} irregular unit which was carrying out the direct orders of a superior officer — i.e. Lord Kitchener's order to [...] "take no prisoners". If Thomas had been able to prove this, the men might well have been exonerated, since it would be almost fifty years before the Nuremberg Trials established the precedent that following orders was not a defence in such cases. But for a commander of Kitchener's lofty position to take the blame for the actions of a few supposed renegade Australians made such an outcome unthinkable for the British. Not surprisingly, Kitchener (through Lt. Col. Hamilton) categorically denied giving any such order, and also denied the existence of a <b>coded</b> <b>telegram</b> from him to Lord Roberts.|$|R

5000|$|Prior to Gambier-Parry's {{appointment}} to reform communications, SIS agents had depended upon <b>coded</b> <b>telegrams</b> relayed by cable. Before {{the onset of}} war in 1939, he attempted to establish the necessary communications facilities for the Secret Intelligence Service. One wireless facility was set up at Woldingham, Surrey, England. Covert transceivers were designed and built at MI6 workshops in Barnes, London. In addition, the Foreign Office agreed to have emergency transceivers, staffed by MI6 agents, sent to missions on the continent. However, Gambier-Parry's efforts were frustrated by the unwillingness of some heads of overseas missions to take them, {{based on the belief}} that their use was contrary to the Vienna Convention. The hesitance on the part of the Secret Intelligence Service to use radio communication resulted in a substantial lack of experience in clandestine wireless communication at the outbreak of war in 1939. [...] Nonetheless, in 1940 he was one of the triumvirate of senior SIS officers who devised the British resistance network, linked by powerful wireless sets.|$|R

Both Burtt and Moore had been flying aces in World War I. At a party in Kansas City, the two former pilots {{came up with the idea}} of a radio series targeted at children and teenagers concerning a 16-year-old pilot and his adventures flying around the world, primarily solving mysteries and crimes and participating in air show races. Burtt and Moore then wrote the initial script about Jimmie Allen, a young telegraph messenger at the Airways Station near Kansas City. A gruff man asks him to send a <b>coded</b> <b>telegram.</b> Later Allen is told that a plane carrying a million dollars to a bank is on its way. Allen figures out the plane is to be hijacked, so he joins his pilot friend, Speed Robertson, in a plan to thwart the hijacking.

50|$|Given that {{he rarely}} left Moscow, Lenin never {{witnessed}} this violence first hand. He sought to publicly {{distance himself from}} such violence, rarely signing his name to the Sovnarkom's repressive decrees. Similarly, he did not typically call for the shooting of counter-revolutionaries and traitors within his published articles and public speeches, although he regularly did so in his <b>coded</b> <b>telegrams</b> and confidential notes. Many middle-ranking Bolsheviks expressed disapproval of the Cheka's mass executions and feared the organisation's apparent unaccountability for its actions. The Party brought in attempts to restrain its activities in early 1919, stripping it of its powers of tribunal and execution, however this only applied in those few areas not underofficial martial law; the Cheka therefore were able to continue their activities as before in large swathes of the country. By 1920, the Cheka had become the most powerful institution in Soviet Russia, exerting influence over all other state apparatus, {{to the extent that}} Pipes considered the country to be a police state.There are no surviving records to provide an accurate figure of how many perished due to the Red Terror, although the later estimates of historians have ranged from 50,000 to 140,000. The majority of these were either well-to-do citizens or members of the Tsarist administration.|$|R

[...] The written record taking {{the chain of command}} and the ultimate responsibility for the fate of the Romanovs back to Lenin was, from the beginning, either never made or carefully concealed. Lenin operated with extreme caution, his favoured method being to issue instructions in <b>coded</b> <b>telegrams,</b> insisting that the original and even the telegraph ribbon on which it was sent be destroyed. Uncovered documents in Archive No. 2 (Lenin), Archive No. 86 (Sverdlov) as well as the archives of the Council of People's Commissars and the Central Executive Committee reveal that a host of party 'errand boys' were regularly designated to relay his instructions, either by confidential notes or anonymous directives made in the collective name of the Council of People's Commissars. In all such decisions Lenin regularly insisted that no written evidence be preserved. The 55 volumes of Lenin's Collected Works as well as the memoirs of those who directly took part in the murders were scrupulously censored, emphasising the roles of Sverdlov and Goloshchyokin.|$|R
