First, previously given results for the free vibrations of such panels are analyzed and unified. Then, a traveling‐wave analysis is used to obtain impedances and transmission‐loss formulas, which are in turn compared with previously published experimental data. The comparison is relatively good, and confirmation of a symmetric <b>coincidence</b> <b>effect</b> is obtained.

These phenomena are: absorption in air and by the sound-absorbing material covering {{the walls and the}} <b>coincidence</b> <b>effect.</b> The absorption in the air can be neglected in small size enclosures for low ultrasonic frequencies (20 – 30 kHz). The coincidence plays a role in decrease of the sound insulation, however the main role play the leaks. The boards made of ceramic fibers have been chosen as the optimal sound-absorbing material.

40|$|Air‐coupled {{ultrasonic}} transducers can excite plate {{waves in}} metals and composites. The <b>coincidence</b> <b>effect,</b> i. e., the wave vector of plate wave coincides with projection of exciting airborne sound vector, {{leads to a}} resonance which strongly amplifies the sound transmission through the plate. The resonance depends on the angle of incidence and the frequency. In the present study, the incidence angle for maximum transmission (θmax) is measured in plates of steel, aluminum, carbon fiber reinforced composites and honeycomb sandwich panels. The variations of (θmax) with plate thickness are compared with theoretical values in steel, aluminum and quasi‐isotropic carbon fiber composites. The enhanced transmission of air‐coupled ultrasound at oblique incidence can substantially improve the probability of flaw detection in plates and especially in honeycomb structures. Experimental air‐coupled ultrasonic scan of subtle flaws in CFRP laminates showed definite improvement of signal‐to‐noise ratio with oblique incidence atθmax...|$|E

Critical choices in the analysis necessary for convergence of the predicted and measured responses are illustrated through sensitivity studies. The methodology includes representation of spatial correlation of the pressure field over the panel surface.

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{spectral}} coincidence implicitly assumes {{some kind of}} quasi-linear behavior, with limited changes in natural frequencies of soil and/or structure. The results of the two previous sections, involving elastoplastic oscillators with variable ductility ratio, indicate that this concept is robust enough to withstand strong nonlinearity in the structure. The scope of this section is to investigate whether the nonlinearity in the site response can significantly weaken the dominant importance of spectral <b>coincidence</b> <b>effects,</b> as it may significantly change the site frequency and the associated amplification. The soil nonlinear behavior is most often characterized by a degradation of its mechanical properties, involving a shear modulus reduction and a damping increase with increasing shear strain; it basically results in deamplifying the ground motion and shifting the frequency response toward lower values (Bonilla et al. 2005; Régnier et al. 2013, 2016).|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{the noise}} {{reduction}} onboard yachts {{is an important}} aspect of ship design. This work focuses on the sound transmission properties of GRP (glass reinforced plastic) structures that are widely used in yacht and small craft construction. One of the main acoustical parameters adopted to measure the attitude of a panel to transmit sound is the transmission loss that estimates the amount of sound reduction that a partition imparts to an acoustic wave impinging on it. An experimental test campaign has been carried out in a small acoustic facility developed by Department of Aerospace Engineering of University of Naples Federico II on a set of GRP panels commonly used in craft construction. Tested panels were different for lay-up and manufacturing process. At a first stage, measured acoustical behaviour has been compared at low-medium frequencies with predictions performed by a finite element based procedure. In order to extend the frequency range of analysis, for some panels energy based models have been developed too. A good agreement between numerical and experimental behaviour has been obtained and mass law region and <b>coincidence</b> <b>effect</b> have been correctly identified...|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{solutions}} are presented for {{the calculation of}} the acoustic insulation provided by an infinite single panel wall when subjected to a spatially sinusoidal harmonic line load or a point pressure load (modelled as a superposition of spatially sinusoidal harmonic line loads). The method used does not entail limiting {{the thickness of the}} layer, as the Kirchhoff or Mindlin theory requires, and fully takes into account the coupling between the fluid (air) and the solid panel. All calculations are performed in the frequency domain. Time signatures are obtained by means of inverse Fourier transforms. Special attention is given to the limitations of the simplified models, which are not able to predict dips of insulation such as that due to the <b>coincidence</b> <b>effect.</b> It has been shown that, although time results may appear complicated, the arrival of various pulses at the receivers can be understood in terms of the travelling body pulses and guided waves. Simulated results have been computed for ceramic, concrete and glass walls of different thickness, when subjected to plane, linear and spherical waves. The insulation computed was found to be highly dependent on receiver position, given the interaction between the incident wave field and the directed reflected field on the wall, when the wall is struck by a cylindrical or a spherical pulse wave.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the airborne noise reduction of agricultural tractor cabs. The characteristics of the noise radiated from a non-cab-equipped tractor have been evaluated and used in conjunction with the classical theories of airborne sound transmission loss to predict the airborne noise reductions of tractor cabs. An experimental cab has beep constructed and used to evaluate these predictions. The theoretical and experimental airborne noise reductions do not show a good agreement. This {{has been shown to be}} due to two ressons. Firstly, there are anomalies in the classical airborne sound transmission loss theory whereby the theoretical and experimental sound transmission loss spectra do not show good agreement. Secondly, one-dimensional standing wave resonances in the cab cavity have been shown to give rise to an irregular plateau in the experimental airborne noise reduction spectra. Anomalies have been shown to exist between airborne sound transmission loss theory and reverberant room transmission loss measurements. These have arisen because the theory has not hitherto considered panel flexure. Modifications have been introduced which take account of panel flexure and these show that the dependence of classical theory on the angle of incident excitation is false and angular dependence occurs on the transmitted side of the panel, giving rise to a <b>coincidence</b> <b>effect</b> on the transmitted side which is independent of the angle of incidence. These modifications give rise to complete qualitative explanation of the shape of empirical airborne sound transmission loss spectra. Quantitative modifications have not been introduced because of lack of information regarding the angular nature of the transmitted waves...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA well-type {{detector}} {{installed in}} the Modane underground Laboratory (LSM) can combine both low background and high detection efficiency and it is well suited {{for the analysis of}} small amounts of environmental samples. Reference materials such as IAEA- 447 (moss-soil), IAEA-RG-Th 1 and IAEA-RG-U 1 were used for the detector calibration, owing to a chemical composition close to those of the environmental samples. Nevertheless, the matrix effects and the true <b>coincidence</b> summing <b>effects</b> must be corrected from the full energy peak efficiency (FEPE). The FEPE was performed {{for a wide range of}} energy by a semi-empirical method using Monte Carlo simulation (MCNP 6), intended for environmental measurements such as lake sediments dating.

40|$|The 4 π NaI(Tl) γ-ray {{detectors}} are {{consisted of}} the well cavity with cylindrical cross section, and the enclosing geometry of measurements with large detection angle. This leads to exceptionally high efficiency level and a significant <b>coincidence</b> summing <b>effect,</b> {{much more than a}} single cylindrical or coaxial detector especially in very low activity measurements. In the present work, the detection effective solid angle in addition to both full-energy peak and total efficiencies of well-type detectors, were mainly calculated by the new numerical simulation method (NSM) and ANGLE 4 software. To obtain the coincidence summing correction factors through the previously mentioned methods, the simulation of the coincident emission of photons was modeled mathematically, based on the analytical equations and complex integrations over the radioactive volumetric sources including the self-attenuation factor. The measured full-energy peak efficiencies and correction factors were done by using 152 Eu, where an exact adjustment is required for the detector efficiency curve, because neglecting the <b>coincidence</b> summing <b>effect</b> can make the results inconsistent with the whole. These phenomena, in general due to the efficiency calibration process and the coincidence summing corrections, appear jointly. The full-energy peak and the total efficiencies from the two methods typically agree with discrepancy 10 %. The discrepancy between the simulation, ANGLE 4 and measured full-energy peak after corrections for the <b>coincidence</b> summing <b>effect</b> was on the average, while not exceeding 14 %. Therefore, this technique can be easily applied in establishing the efficiency calibration curves of well-type detectors...|$|R
40|$|A new magnet {{system has}} been {{designed}} and constructed to reduce <b>coincidence</b> <b>effects</b> between alpha particles and conversion electrons in high-resolution alpha-particle spectrometry. By means of a magnetic field, the conversion electrons are deflected away from the PIPS detector. Compared to existing magnet systems, the new system is not restricted to point sources and can accommodate source diameters up to about 30 mm. Two yokes were built, allowing for configurations with 20 mm or 36 mm distance between the magnets. The effectiveness of both configurations is demonstrated by measuring the conversion electron spectrum of a 237 Np source. The magnet system effectively rejects 93 (7) % of electrons up to 85 keV (36 mm) and 90 (9) % of electrons up to 320 keV (20 mm). It has been successfully applied in the alpha-particle spectrometry of the long-lived nuclides 236 U and 238 U, resulting in significant improvement of the accuracy of alpha emission probabilities.

40|$|The use of {{lightweight}} construction in building applications offers flexibility in use {{and ease of}} construction but often {{goes hand in hand}} with reduced sound insulation. Regarding this issue, this thesis investigates sound transmission behaviour of such structures. A numerical model is developed using a coupled waveguide finite element-boundary element (WFBE) method to predict the transmission loss (TL) of more complex structures and is applied to double panel systems. Initially, analytical waveguide models for a plate strip are developed. These models are used to gain insight into the vibro-acoustic behaviour of such a structure, particularly compared with an infinite system, as well as for validating the WFBE method. Compared with results for an infinite double panel system, the finite extent in one direction of the waveguide system introduces some features in its TL. One of them is the presence of lateral cavity modes. These introduce additional stiffness to the air in the cavity so that the mass-air-mass resonance frequency of the waveguide structure shifts to higher frequency. Such additional stiffness reduces the overall transmission loss. This tendency is confirmed by measurement results. Another aspect related with the finite width is the presence of internal coincidence phenomena which cause dips that are not related with cavity resonance and are also independent of incidence angles. Moreover, a higher TL is found for the waveguide double panel partition at low frequencies as the finite width system radiates less efficiently than the infinite plate model. The results obtained also confirm that the dissipative mechanism behaviour found in the structure originates from the cavity rather than from the panel as postulated by London. The effect of studs connecting the two leaves of the double panel system is also investigated. The effect of the air in the cavity becomes less significant with increasing frequency for the case of stiff studs so that the stud behaviour is predominant at high frequency. However, for more flexible studs lateral cavity modes and the internal <b>coincidence</b> <b>effect</b> become more significant and reduce the sound transmission loss. Therefore, for the case of elastic steel studs where no sound absorbent material in the cavity, both the transmission paths need to be handled carefully in order to achieve a good prediction of TL. Comparisons of the numerical model results and measurements suggest that inclusion of an appropriate cavity loss factor is important to achieve accurate results particularly when sound absorbing material is absent from the cavity. A reduced air stiffness also needs to be considered to account for practical considerations. Moreover, it is of importance to include the detail in terms of elastic stud geometry in order to have a more representative stiffness. The comparison results also indicate that numerical models based on the WFBE method are able to produce good prediction results. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Alpha-particle {{spectrometry}} {{is routinely}} {{performed with the}} aim of measuring absolute activities, activity ratios between different alpha-emitting nuclides or decay data such as branching factors, alpha emission probabilities and relative half-lives. It is most commonly performed with ion-implanted silicon detectors. Strong features of the technique are the low background levels that can be achieved due to low sensitivity to other types of radiation, the intrinsic efficiency close to 1 which reduces the efficiency calculations to a geometrical problem and the uniqueness of the energy spectra for each alpha-decaying nuclide. The main challenge is the limitation to the attainable energy resolution, even with thin and homogenous sources, which causes alpha energy peaks to be partially unresolved due to their width and low-energy tailing. The spectral deconvolution often requires fitting of analytical functions to each peak in the alpha spectrum. True <b>coincidence</b> <b>effects</b> between alpha particles and subsequently emitted conversion electrons cause distortions of the alpha spectra which lead to significant changes in the apparent peak area ratios. Optimum energy resolution can only be achieved on very thin sources, which puts constraints on the source preparation techniques. Radiochemical separations may be needed to extract the alpha emitters from voluminous matrices and efficiency tracing is performed by adding in another isotope by known amounts. Typical uncertainty components are discussed by means of some hypothetical examples. JRC. D. 4 -Standards for Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguard...|$|R

The Relativistic Electron-Proton Telescope (REPT) on board the Radiation Belt Storm Probe (RBSP) pair of spacecraft consists of a stack of high-performance silicon solid-state detectors in a telescope configuration, a collimation aperture, and a thick case surrounding the detector stack to shield the sensors from penetrating radiation and bremsstrahlung. The instrument points perpendicular to the spin axis of the spacecraft and measures high-energy electrons (up to ∼ 20 MeV) with excellent sensitivity and also measures magnetospheric and solar protons to energies well above E= 100 MeV. The instrument has a large geometric factor (g= 0. 2 cm 2 [*]sr) to get reasonable count rates (above background) at the higher energies and yet will not saturate at the lower energy ranges.

40|$|Growing {{concern about}} the effects of {{anthropogenic}} sound on marine life has highlighted the need for empirical methods to study behavioral responses of marine animals to specific acoustic exposures. Some effects have been discovered by observing <b>coincidence</b> of <b>effects</b> with sound exposure, e. g. beaked whales such as Ziphius cavirostris and Mesoplodon densirostris may mass strand during sonar exercises. Sometimes new activities trigger precautionary concern, such as the potential effects of deep water seismic surveys on deep-diving endangered species, e. g. sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus. In both cases, the best way to prove that a particular sound stimulus causes a behavioral response involves experiments whereby a specific dose of sound is broadcast to an animal and the acoustic exposure and behavioral responses of the animal are measured. The present paper argues for a balance of experimental and observational studies of effects of sound on marine life, designed so that each kind of study complements the other.
