40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} the parametric optimization of Symmetric Toggle RF MEMS Switch (STS), particularly for reduction of overall dimensions and improvement in isolation and insertion loss. The variations in device topology, especially the <b>connecting</b> <b>lever</b> length demonstrates {{a significant change}} in resonance frequency and overall device dimensions. The impact of multilayer metal structures used to realize the bridge portion of the switch is also studied by changing the number and composition of metal layers. A single layer structure shows better insertion loss characteristics compared to more complex multilayer stack with added advantage of reduction in fabrication complexity. The relative change in residual stress for single and multilayer structure is also discussed. Additional compactness in size (46 %) is achieved by changing the switch dielectric from SiO 2 to HfO 2 with dielectric constant 20...|$|E

40|$|Mechanical fault {{diagnosis}} of high-voltage circuit breakers (HVCBs) based on vibration signal analysis {{is one of}} the most significant issues in improving the reliability and reducing the outage cost for power systems. The limitation of training samples and types of machine faults in HVCBs causes the existing mechanical fault diagnostic methods to recognize new types of machine faults easily without training samples as either a normal condition or a wrong fault type. A new mechanical {{fault diagnosis}} method for HVCBs based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and multi-layer classifier (MLC) is proposed to improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis. First, HVCB vibration signals during operation are measured using an acceleration sensor. Second, a VMD algorithm is used to decompose the vibration signals into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The IMF matrix is divided into submatrices to compute the local singular values (LSV). The maximum singular values of each submatrix are selected as the feature vectors for fault diagnosis. Finally, a MLC composed of two one-class support vector machines (OCSVMs) and a support vector machine (SVM) is constructed to identify the fault type. Two layers of independent OCSVM are adopted to distinguish normal or fault conditions with known or unknown fault types, respectively. On this basis, SVM recognizes the specific fault type. Real diagnostic experiments are conducted with a real SF 6 HVCB with normal and fault states. Three different faults (i. e., jam fault of the iron core, looseness of the base screw, and poor lubrication of the <b>connecting</b> <b>lever)</b> are simulated in a field experiment on a real HVCB to test the feasibility of the proposed method. Results show that the classification accuracy of the new method is superior to other traditional methods...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, Zinkin {{operated}} several gyms in the Los Angeles area. Zinkin {{wanted to make}} strength training safer and more accessible to novices, and thus broaden {{the appeal of the}} sport. To that end, he developed the [...] "weight machine". Instead of lifting a bar with weight plates on it, the user pulls or pushes a handle <b>connected</b> by <b>levers</b> or cables to a stack of weight plates riding on steel guideposts. This allows a user to perform weightlifting exercises with no risk of dropping the weight on himself.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the more}} common {{applications}} of a four-bar linkage appears as a rod that <b>connects</b> two <b>levers,</b> so that rotation of the first lever drives {{the rotation of the}} second lever. The levers are hinged to a ground frame and are called the input and output cranks, and the connecting rod is the called the coupler link. Burmester's approach to the design of a four-bar linkage can be used to locate the coupler so that five specified angles of the input crank result in five specified angles of the output crank.|$|R
50|$|The {{rate of flow}} of {{the gases}} was {{controlled}} by the driver by means of dampers placed {{at the top of}} the superheater box.

50|$|First {{invented in}} 1939, a wing corkscrew, {{sometimes}} called a butterfly corkscrew or angel corkscrew, has two levers, one {{on either side}} of the worm. As the worm is twisted into the cork, the levers are raised. Pushing down the levers draws the cork from the bottle in one smooth motion. The most common design has a rack and pinion <b>connecting</b> the <b>levers</b> to the body. The head of the central shaft is frequently modified to form a bottle opener, increasing the utility of the device. Corkscrews of this design are particularly popular in household use.|$|R
5000|$|A barge to {{be weighed}} {{was brought into}} a {{supporting}} cradle <b>connected</b> by <b>levers</b> to a weighing mechanism. The water was then drained and the scale balance adjusted to determine the barge gross weight. Subtracting the tare weight ({{the weight of the}} barge when empty) would give the cargo weight. Originally weighlocks measured the weight of the barge, initially by measuring the displacement of water from the lock by collecting the liquid in a separate measuring chamber after the barge had entered. [...] This method also requires that the unladen weight of the barge be known.|$|R

5000|$|Torque is {{the force}} being exerted on a {{theoretical}} <b>lever</b> <b>connected</b> to the output shaft of an engine. This is {{expressed by the}} formula:where [...] is {{the length of the}} lever, [...] is the force applied on it, and [...] is the vector cross product.Torque is measured typically either in newton-metres (N·m, SI units) or in foot-pounds (ft·lb, imperial units).|$|R
50|$|The jigger {{consists}} of a slotted wooded board that floats under the ice surface and two <b>levers</b> <b>connected</b> {{in such a way}} that when a rope <b>connected</b> to one <b>lever</b> (arm) is pulled, the second lever (leg) jabs into the ice and pushes against the ice to move the board in the direction opposite to the rope pull. After each pull a spring resets the arm, and the action is repeated. In this way a person by an ice hole propels the jigger away. If the ice is transparent enough, one just makes another hole over the jigger when it moves far away. (Otherwise the progress of the jigger may be monitored by the tapping noise of the jigger's leg.) After that the jigger is pulled out of the second hole, together with the rope, and the net may be stretched under the ice using the rope from one hole to another.|$|R

50|$|The Airphibian {{took the}} {{approach}} of converting from an aircraft to a roadable vehicle by a conversion process that left aircraft sections behind during road use. The process consisted of removing a three-bladed propeller and placing it on a hook {{on the side of}} the fuselage, cranking down support casters, and disengaging lock <b>levers</b> <b>connecting</b> the flight unit to the road unit. The wing and aft fuselage are detached for road use.|$|R
50|$|Wire ropes were {{developed}} starting with mining hoist {{applications in the}} 1830s. Wire ropes are used dynamically for lifting and hoisting in cranes and elevators, and for transmission of mechanical power. Wire rope {{is also used to}} transmit force in mechanisms, such as a Bowden cable or the control surfaces of an airplane <b>connected</b> to <b>levers</b> and pedals in the cockpit. Only aircraft cables have WSC (wire strand core). Also, aircraft cables are available in smaller diameters than wire rope. For example, aircraft cables are available in 3/64 in. diameter while most wire ropes begin at a 1/4 in. diameter. Static wire ropes are used to support structures such as suspension bridges or as guy wires to support towers. An aerial tramway relies on wire rope to support and move cargo overhead.|$|R
5000|$|The Commer TS3 3-cylinder truck engines (originally {{designed}} by Tilling-Stevens) {{have a single}} crankshaft beneath {{the centre of the}} cylinders with both pistons <b>connected</b> by <b>levers.</b> This type of engine configuration dates at least back as far as 1914, as a 2-stroke petrol engine referred to as the [...] "Simpson's balanced two-stroke" [...] was described in the Motor Cycle magazine of this date. This design used crankcase compression, and used one piston to uncover the transfer port, and another to open the exhaust port allowing the fresh charge to flow {{from one end of the}} cylinder to the other, thereby avoiding the need for deflector crowns for pistons used in most 2-strokes at that time. The levers operating the pistons allowed for a large piston travel with smaller crank throw.|$|R

50|$|A hub gear, internal-gear hub, or just gear hub is a {{gear ratio}} {{changing}} system commonly used on bicycles that is implemented with planetary or epicyclic gears. The gears and lubricants are sealed within the shell of the hub gear, in contrast with derailleur gears where the gears and mechanism {{are exposed to the}} elements. Changing the gear ratio was traditionally accomplished by a shift <b>lever</b> <b>connected</b> to the hub with a Bowden cable, and twist-grip style shifters have become common.|$|R

5000|$|Henszey's {{reversing}} gear, patented in 1882, {{illustrates a}} typical early solution. [...] Henszey's device {{consists of two}} pistons mounted on a single piston rod. Both pistons are double-ended. One is a steam piston to move the rod as required. The other, containing oil, holds the rod in a fixed position when the steam is turned off. Control is by a small three-way steam valve (“forward”, “stop”, “back”) and a separate indicator showing {{the position of the}} rod and thus the percentage of cutoff in use. When the steam valve is at “stop”, an oil cock connecting the two ends of the locking piston is also closed, thus holding the mechanism in position. The piston rod <b>connects</b> by <b>levers</b> to the reversing gear, which operates in the usual way, according to the type of valve gear in use.|$|R
