40|$|The most {{expensive}} {{component of a}} fuel cell is the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), which consists of an ionomer membrane coated with catalyst material. Best-performing MEAs are currently fabricated by depositing and drying liquid catalyst ink on the membrane; however, this process is limited to individual preparation by hand due to the membrane’s rapid water absorption that leads to shape deformation and coating defects. A continuous <b>coating</b> <b>line</b> can reduce the cost and time needed to fabricate the MEA, incentivizing the commercialization and widespread adoption of fuel cells. A pilot-scale membrane <b>coating</b> <b>line</b> was designed for such a task and is described in this paper. Accurate process control is necessary to prevent manufacturing defects from occurring in the <b>coating</b> <b>line.</b> A linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) controller was developed based on a physics-based model of the coating process to optimally control the temperature and humidity of the drying zones.

Due to the closed loop, efficiency and the overall output of the system is highly dependent on the sequence of the production orders entering the line. Inefficient sequences can cause deadlocks, significant decrease of the production output or even scrap production. The presented application architecture is based on a 3 D simulation platform working together with a closed loop heuristic sequence scheduling algorithm.

BLUESCOPE STEEL operates a number of metal <b>coating</b> <b>lines</b> with each having its own unique bottom dross behaviour. In some <b>coating</b> <b>lines</b> there is excessive bottom dross build-up, and to understand why this might occur two 113 scale experimental models were constructed one corresponding to a pot with an excessive bottom dross build-up problem and one without. Experiments were carried out to determine suspension characteristics, namely solids concentration as a hnction of time and particle deposition profiles, for different values of: water flow rates (kinetic power) through the inductors, bath geometry and coating speeds. The effect of the moving strip on suspended dross particles is discussed. Dross particle suspension in the coating bath was quantified by sampling the bath at various locations and using a particle analyser capable of counting and size distribution. It was found that for both inductor types (conventional and Jetflow) the kinetic power input due to the inductor jets had the greatest influence on suspension characteristics. The use of water modeling {{as a tool for}} problem solving, improved pot design and for developing operating practices to minimize bottom dross build-up is also discussed...|$|E

40|$|Recovery and reuse of {{the powder}} {{that has not}} been {{deposited}} on the workpieces during application represents an important benefit of the powder coating technology. However, a characte-ristic concomitant phenomenon of the powder recycling process is the shift in the particle size distribution of the powder. Well known consquences are, among other things, a gradual decrease of the film thickness, an increasing agglomeration of the fines in the recycled powder, and sticking of the powder to the interior surfaces of the feeding system. On the other hand, the requirements regarding the quality and reliability performance of powder <b>coating</b> <b>lines</b> are increasing. Thus, there has been a strong need to execute investigations with regard to a better control of the complete powder recycling process. In this regard, with Fraunhofer IPA responsible, several R&D projects funded by the German governement and coordinated by the DFO have been carried out. The objective of these projects has been a wider application of the powder coating technology. Within the scope of these projects, the Fraunhofer IPA has build up a variable powder coating test line and has developed new sophisticated methods for measuring, controlling and simulating the powder coating process. By using these methods, the strong influence of the powder application parameters, especially of the spray guns themselves, on the powder recycling process has been demonstrated. The well known flat spray and conical spray nozzles show, as a consequence of their strong particle size separation, a rather critical behaviour. The lecture presents examples for the application of these new methods in order to improve the powder paint application and recovery process, e. g. the development of new powder spray guns with minimized particle size separation, enabling a consistent powder recycling process, the application of powder coatings with reduced content of fines, the development of conceptions for the future design of automatically controlled powder coating processes, and the design and optimization of today`s powder <b>coating</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|E

40|$|Coil coating is {{a widely}} used coating method where a coating is {{continuously}} applied onto a steel strip. At SSAB the topcoat is applied using reverse three-roll coating. There are various coating errors that are typical for this coating method {{that are difficult to}} eliminate. The aim of this thesis was to reduce the formation of striping errors in polyester coatings at SSAB's continuous color <b>coating</b> <b>lines</b> by modifying the properties of the paint. The focus of this thesis is on two specific common coating errors: the longitudinal ribbing stripe and the transverse cascade stripe. Cascade occurs when the meniscus between the rolls travels too far inside the nip due to a high roll speed ratio. This causes air to get caught in the meniscus, which leads to a transverse stripe. Ribbing occurs when pressure gradients in the meniscus cause small disturbances to widen instead of leveling. The conditions where striping errors form are complicated and often difficult to control. In practice, the surface quality in reverse roll coating is controlled by modifying the roll speeds. Suitable roll speed ranges constitute a coating window, in which the produced surface quality is considered to be acceptable. Based on literature, it was identified that the coating window could be widened by increasing the surface tension of the paint. To confirm the effect of surface tension on error formation, a series of trial runs with modified polyester paints with increased and lowered surface tension was performed. The line trials were designed to go through a trial cycle, where the striping of the paints was comprehensively tested at various roll speed conditions. Viscosity and surface tension of the paints were measured. In addition to the polyester paints, a particle structured paint was also modified and a line trial was performed. The results of the trial runs were positive with the high surface tension polyester paints exhibiting superior surface quality compared to production paints in all trial runs. The high surface tension particle structured paint also had significant improvement in striping performance, which means that the improvements gained by increasing the surface tension could potentially be extended to other coatings used at SSAB...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of an {{increasing}} employment of powder coating technology, the complex interrelations in the powder application, mainly the particle size distribution and its influence, must be understood. For that, in the first part a new measuring method had to be developed, to make visible the problematics and in the next part to find a solution for it. This includes: the monitoring of the process control parameters (powder mass flow rate, particle size distribution, electrostatics, air flow and climate), {{the development of a new}} testing method for powder spray systems, the development of a simulation method to predict the recycling behaviour (KAP-SIM-method), the employment of a newly developed charge spectrometer for coating powder. With the aim of these methods in the experimental optimization measures the following process parameters were taken into consideration: particle size spectrum of coating powder, coating powder recovery method and the distribution nozzles of the spray systems. For an increasing and efficient use of powder coating systems in the future, the users demand more flexible powder spray guns. That means powder guns with which the dimensions of the spray cloud may be shaped continuously. The present thesis was aimed at realizing such powder spray systems in form of powder spray guns using aerodynamical and electrostatical solution approaches. Two completely different solutions were separately realized. On the field of electrostatics mainly the influence of steering electrodes was tested. In combination with tribo charging powder this electrodes are very effective. On the other hand, a new pistol could be dimensioned and optimized with the help of numerical simulation. The continuous regulation of the spray cloud was realized with additional controlling airs. In the future, the simulation will be an important tool in the investigation of complex powder coating processes. In the development of such systems the simulation will be used more and more. With it, the development time of the product is reduced. Therein the powder guns are only one part in the coating process. In the future, not only powder applicators will be simulated on the computer but also whole coating processes and <b>coating</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|E
