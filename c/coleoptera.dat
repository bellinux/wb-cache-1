5|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} popular among fungus-loving beetles. In a Russian study, 54 species from 16 {{families}} in the <b>Coleoptera</b> complex were recorded using the fungus; the most common were Cis comptus, Sillcacis affinis (Ciidae), Tritoma subbasalis, Dacne bipustulata (Erotylidae), Mycetophagus multipunctatus, M.piceus (Mycetophagidae), and Thymalus oblongus (Trogossitidae).|$|E
5|$|Beetles are a {{group of}} insects that form the order <b>Coleoptera,</b> in the {{superorder}} Endopterygota. Their front pair of wings is hardened into wing-cases, elytra, distinguishing them from most other insects. The <b>Coleoptera,</b> with about 400,000 species, is the largest of all orders, constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms; new species are discovered frequently. The largest of all families, the Curculionidae (weevils) with some 70,000 member species, belongs to this order. They are found in almost every habitat except {{the sea and the}} polar regions. They interact with their ecosystems in several ways: beetles often feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris, and eat other invertebrates. Some species are serious agricultural pests, such as the Colorado potato beetle, while others such as Coccinellidae (ladybirds or ladybugs) eat aphids, scale insects, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.|$|E
5|$|The {{consistency}} of beetle morphology, in particular their possession of elytra, has long suggested that <b>Coleoptera</b> is monophyletic, though {{there have been}} doubts about {{the arrangement of the}} suborders, namely the Adephaga, Archostemata, Myxophaga and Polyphaga within that clade. The twisted-wing parasites, Strepsiptera, are thought to be a sister group to the beetles, having split from them in the Early Permian.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the invertebrate population in the canopy of Banksia woodland found that mites and ticks (Acari), beetles (<b>Coleoptera)</b> and ants, bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) predominated overall, with the three orders also common on B. ilicifolia, although outnumbered by thrips (Thysanoptera). More arthropods on B. ilicifolia {{might be related to}} a higher nutrient (potassium) level in the leaves. Lower overall numbers of invertebrates on Banksia species were thought {{to be related to the}} presence of insectivorous birds.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} recognized {{as an integral part}} of the river otter's diet. Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. Most aquatic invertebrates preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and <b>Coleoptera</b> (adult beetles). Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the otters.|$|E
5|$|Between 950,000–1,000,000 of all {{described}} {{species are}} insects, so over 50% of all described eukaryotes (1.8 million) are insects (see illustration). With only 950,000 known non-insects, if {{the actual number}} of insects is 5.5 million, they may represent over 80% of the total, and with only about 20,000 new species of all organisms being described each year, most insect species likely will remain undescribed, unless species descriptions greatly increase in rate. Of the 24 orders of insects, four dominate in terms of numbers of described species, with at least 670,000 species included in <b>Coleoptera,</b> Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera.|$|E
5|$|In more derived {{orders of}} insects, such as Diptera (flies) and Hymenoptera (wasp), the {{indirect}} muscles occupy the greatest {{volume of the}} pterothorax and function as {{the primary source of}} power for the wingstroke. Contraction of the dorsolongitudinal muscles causes the severe arching of the notum which depresses the wing while contraction of the dorsoventral muscles causes opposite motion of notum. Other more primitive insects, such as Orthoptera (locusts), <b>Coleoptera</b> (beetles), and Odonata (dragonflies) use direct muscles that are responsible for developing the needed power for the up and down strokes.|$|E
5|$|The {{name of the}} taxonomic order, <b>Coleoptera,</b> {{comes from}} the Greek koleopteros (κολεόπτερος), given to the group by Aristotle for their elytra, {{hardened}} shield-like forewings, from koleos, sheath, and pteron, wing. The English name beetle comes from the Old English word bitela, little biter, related to bītan (to bite), leading to Middle English betylle. Another Old English name for beetle is ceafor, chafer, used in names such as cockchafer, from the Proto-Germanic *kabraz- (compare German Käfer).|$|E
5|$|The phylogenetic {{position}} of Diptera has been controversial. The monophyly of holometabolous insects {{has long been}} accepted, with the main orders being established as Lepidoptera, <b>Coleoptera,</b> Hymenoptera and Diptera, {{and it is the}} relationships between these groups which has caused difficulties. Diptera is widely thought {{to be a member of}} Mecopterida, along with Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Trichoptera (caddisflies), Siphonaptera (fleas), Mecoptera (scorpionflies) and possibly Strepsiptera (twisted-wing flies). Diptera has been grouped with Siphonaptera and Mecoptera in the Antliophora, but this has not been confirmed by molecular studies.|$|E
5|$|Very low {{sounds are}} also {{produced}} in various species of <b>Coleoptera,</b> Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Mantodea and Neuroptera. These low sounds are simply the sounds {{made by the}} insect's movement. Through microscopic stridulatory structures located on the insect's muscles and joints, the normal sounds of the insect moving are amplified {{and can be used}} to warn or communicate with other insects. Most sound-making insects also have tympanal organs that can perceive airborne sounds. Some species in Hemiptera, such as the corixids (water boatmen), are known to communicate via underwater sounds. Most insects are also able to sense vibrations transmitted through surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Wing {{areas are}} delimited and {{subdivided}} by fold-lines along which the wing can fold, and flexion-lines along which the wing can flex during flight. The fundamental {{distinction between the}} flexion-lines and the fold-lines is often blurred, as fold-lines may permit some flexibility or vice versa. Two constants that are found in nearly all insect wings are the claval (a flexion-line) and jugal folds (or fold line); forming variable and unsatisfactory boundaries. Wing foldings can very complicated, with transverse folding occurs in the hindwings of Dermaptera and <b>Coleoptera,</b> and in some insects the anal area can be folded like a fan.|$|E
5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult diapause {{is the most common}} form of diapause in <b>Coleoptera.</b> To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually the cue is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the alimentary canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{beat their}} wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and {{are found in}} the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, <b>Coleoptera,</b> and Hemiptera. Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30°C (86°F) using this method.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} another {{important}} defense found among species of <b>Coleoptera</b> and Lepidoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors, such as the monarch butterfly. They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this is actually the basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{confirms that}} the <b>Coleoptera</b> are monophyletic. Duane McKenna et al. (2015) used eight nuclear genes for 367 species from 172 of 183 Coleopteran families. They split the Adephaga into 2 clades, Hydradephaga and Geadephaga, broke up the Cucujoidea into 3 clades, and placed the Lymexyloidea within the Tenebrionoidea. The Polyphaga appear to date from the Triassic. Most extant beetle families appear to have arisen in the Cretaceous. The cladogram is based on McKenna (2015). The number of species in each group (mainly superfamilies) is shown in parentheses, and boldface if over 10,000. English names are given where possible. Dates of origin of major groups are shown in italics in {{millions of years ago}} (mya).|$|E
5|$|Several highly {{successful}} insect groups—especially the Hymenoptera (wasps, bees and ants) and Lepidoptera (butterflies) {{as well as}} many types of Diptera (flies) and <b>Coleoptera</b> (beetles)—evolved in conjunction with flowering plants during the Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago). The earliest bees, important pollinators today, appeared in the early Cretaceous. A group of wasps sister to the bees evolved {{at the same time as}} flowering plants, as did the Lepidoptera. Further, all the major clades of bees first appeared between the middle and late Cretaceous, simultaneously with the adaptive radiation of the eudicots (three quarters of all angiosperms), and at the time when the angiosperms became the world's dominant plants on land.|$|E
5|$|The Land Yeo river {{flows to}} the east of the town. The North Somerset Levels to the west have been drained and farmed by generations of farmers. Tickenham, Nailsea and Kenn Moors SSSI is a 129.4 hectare {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest. The soils in the area include clays of the Allerton and Wentloog Series and peat soils of the Sedgemoor and Godney Series, which are drained by a network of large rhynes and smaller field ditches, which support exceptionally rich plant and invertebrate fauna communities. Exceptional populations of <b>Coleoptera</b> occur, amongst which are at least 12nationally scarce species and 2nationally rare species, including Britain’s largest water beetle the great silver water beetle (Hydrophilus piceus). There are several other local nature reserves.|$|E
5|$|Triaenops menamena mainly {{occurs in}} the dry regions of western Madagascar, but has also been {{recorded}} in humid areas in the far southeast and northeast, and is found up to 1300m (4300ft) above sea level. It mainly occurs in forests, but has also been recorded outside forest and is not dependent on it. An obligate cave dweller, it is known to roost in large colonies, with one cave colony estimated to contain over 40,000 bats; this cave also contained an estimated 10,000 Paratriaenops furculus. The effective population size of the species {{is estimated to be}} about 121,000. Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) form the main component of its diet, but it also eats <b>Coleoptera</b> (beetles) and Hemiptera (bugs) and fewer members of some other insect orders. It is unclear how the ecological niches of Triaenops and the less frequently captured Paratriaenops furculus are separated, as both eat lepidopterans and occur in the same regions.|$|E
