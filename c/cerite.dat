5|$|Samarium was {{discovered}} in 1879 by the French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran and named after the mineral samarskite from which it was isolated. The mineral itself was earlier named after a Russian mine official, Colonel Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets, who thereby became {{the first person to}} have a chemical element named after him, albeit indirectly. Although classified as a rare-earth element, samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and is more common than such metals as tin. Samarium occurs with concentration up to 2.8% in several minerals including <b>cerite,</b> gadolinite, samarskite, monazite and bastnäsite, the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element. These minerals are mostly found in China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia; China is by far the world leader in samarium mining and production.|$|E
5|$|Samarium is {{not found}} free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is {{contained}} in many minerals, including monazite, bastnäsite, <b>cerite,</b> gadolinite and samarskite; monazite (in which samarium occurs at concentrations of up to 2.8%) and bastnäsite are mostly used as commercial sources. World resources of samarium are estimated at two million tonnes; they are mostly located in China, US, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia, and the annual production is about 700 tonnes. Country production reports are usually given for all rare-earth metals combined. By far, China has the largest production with 120,000 tonnes mined per year; it {{is followed by the}} US (about 5,000tonnes) and India (2,700tonnes). Samarium is usually sold as oxide, which at the price of about 30USD/kg is one of the cheapest lanthanide oxides. Whereas mischmetal – a mixture of rare earth metals containing about 1% of samarium – has long been used, relatively pure samarium has been isolated only recently, through ion exchange processes, solvent extraction techniques, and electrochemical deposition. The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of samarium(III) chloride with sodium chloride or calcium chloride. Samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum. The product is then distilled to separate samarium (boiling point 1794°C) and lanthanum (b.p.3464°C).|$|E

Monazite (marine sands from Brazil, India, or Australia; rock from South Africa), bastnäsite (from Mountain Pass, California, or several localities in China), and loparite (Kola Peninsula, Russia) have been the principal ores of cerium {{and the light}} lanthanides.|$|E
500|$|Cerium was {{originally}} {{isolated in the}} form of its oxide, which was named ceria, a term that is still used. The metal itself was too electropositive to be isolated by then-current smelting technology, a characteristic of rare-earth metals in general. After the development of electrochemistry by Humphry Davy five years later, the earths soon yielded the metals they contained. Ceria, as isolated in 1803, contained all of the lanthanides present in the <b>cerite</b> ore from Bastnäs, Sweden, and thus only contained about 45% of what is now known to be pure ceria. It was not until Carl Gustaf Mosander succeeded in removing lanthana and [...] "didymia" [...] in the late 1830s that ceria was obtained pure. Wilhelm Hisinger was a wealthy mine-owner and amateur scientist, and sponsor of Berzelius. He owned and controlled the mine at Bastnäs, and had been trying for years to find out the composition of the abundant heavy gangue rock (the [...] "Tungsten of Bastnäs", which despite its name contained no tungsten), now known as <b>cerite,</b> that he had in his mine.

Between 1839 and 1843, ceria was shown to be a mixture of oxides by the Swedish surgeon and chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander, who lived in the same house as Berzelius: he separated out two other oxides which he named lanthana and didymia. He partially decomposed a sample of cerium nitrate by roasting it in air and then treating the resulting oxide with dilute nitric acid.

The heavy pair of samarium and europium were only removed in 1879 by Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran and it was not until 1885 that Carl Auer von Welsbach separated didymium into praseodymium and neodymium.

50|$|Terbium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Tb and atomic number 65. It is a silvery-white, {{rare earth metal}} that is malleable, ductile, and soft enough to be cut with a knife.

5000|$|Didymium was {{discovered}} by Carl Mosander in 1841 and was so named because it {{is very similar to}} lanthanum, with which it was found. Mosander wrongly believed didymium to be an element, under the impression that [...] "ceria" [...] (sometimes called <b>cerite)</b> isolated by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1803 was really a mixture of cerium, lanthanum and didymium. He was right about lanthanum's being an element, but not about didymium. Mosander did as well as could be expected at the time, since spectroscopy had not yet been invented. His three [...] "elements" [...] accounted for at least 95% of the rare earths in the original <b>cerite</b> from Bastnäs, Sweden. Didymium had not been difficult to find, since it was providing the pinkish tinge to the salts of ceria when in trivalent form. During the period when didymium was believed to be an element, the symbol Di was used for it. In the illustration of Mendeleev's first attempt at a periodic table, shown on the right, it will be noted that the atomic weights assigned to the various lanthanides, including didymium, reflect the original belief that they were divalent. Their actual trivalency meant that his atomic weights for them were only about 67% of their true values.|$|E

Cerium has {{an important role in}} three-way catalysis and fluid catalytic cracking, two significant catalytic processes by their economic relevance and tonnage. Cerium and other rare earths have been studied as possible heterogeneous catalysts at selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. <b>Cerite</b> and monazite are minerals with high concentration of cerium element. Extraction of cerium metal using conventional leaching processes has shown low yields or high costs. The main purpose of this research work is to optimize the parameters in cerium purification stage from this mineral using leaching process. To separate particles with different granulometries, the mineral is ground and fractioned with sieves of 80, 200, 250 and 400 mesh. In order to put off organic components and oxidize cerium(III) to cerium(IV), samples were roasted at 1073 K by twenty-four hours. The roasted samples were solubilized by acid attack (leaching) for approximately twenty-four hours; according to the acid used hydrochloric or sulfuric), cerium and other trivalent elements are solubilized as chloride or sulfate solution. Cerium was extracted by selective precipitation at pH~ 3, 4 using ammonium or natrium hydroxide as pH changer.

40|$|Defining and {{understanding}} the long-term social and ecological evolution of rural cultural landscapes can provide insights into complex dynamics of landscape and environment changes. Land cover changes (LCCs) in Mediterranean-type ecosystems are mainly due to human-induced landscape transformations. Multi-scale spatial analysis can provide useful information {{in the interpretation of}} LCCs data and contribute to identifying underlying drivers of landscape change. In the present study, we analyze eight diachronic land cover maps and perform statistical data assessments of human pressure in the Tolfa–Cerite district (Northern Latium, central Italy) to investigate potential changes in the cultural landscape. The Tolfa– <b>Cerite</b> district is a generally dry area with subhumid–humid sites and an interesting mosaic of Mediterranean-temperate vegetation, agricultural and pastoral land, and a millenarian human presence. LCCs were assessed over a period of 57 years (1949 – 2006) using maps at both low- resolution (1 : 100. 000) and high-resolution (1 : 25. 000) with different class nomenclature sys- tems. Three primary land cover changes have been observed during the investigated period: (i) urbanization, (ii) land abandonment, and (iii) deforestation. While the former two classes of landscape change are particularly common in the northern Mediterranean region, forest conversion to pastures and shrub lands due to intensive grazing, fires, climate aridity, and increasing human pressure is, nowadays, rarely observed in Italy. Better understanding the influence of population dynamics at the local scale and other drivers of LCCs can help fine- tuning conservation policies looking at landscape quality, diversity, and fragmentation...|$|E
30|$|To {{understand}} the basic process {{with the help}} of some fundamental parameter with easier way, another method called ultrasonic irradiation is more effective and efficient in this regard. The high frequency and short wavelength of ultrasonic wave makes it possible to interact with the atoms and materials of the concerned medium without any destruction of the medium or individual property of component. Tributyl phosphate (TBP) has been extensively used as a solvent in nuclear industry for fuel reprocessing due to its excellent chemical resistance and physical properties which results in better separation than other solvents. The extracting power of TBP is mainly due to presence of phosphoryl group which form solvates with the metal ions. The diluent-like toluene improves the physical properties of TBP by lowering its density and viscosity for better phase separation. Hence, it is important to study various physical properties of TBP in presence of diluent. In applications of liquid-liquid extraction processes for recycling of used nuclear fuel, the aqueous phase co-exists with an organic extracting phase which consists of a mixture of an extracting agent and a diluent. Cerium {{is a member of the}} lanthanide series of metals and is the most abundant of the rare earth elements in the earth’s crust. When present in compounds, cerium exists in both the trivalent (Ce 3 +) and the tetravalent (Ce 4 +) state. Cerium is found in nature along with other lanthanide elements in the minerals like alanite, bastnasite, monazite, <b>cerite,</b> and samarskite; however, only bastnasite and monazite are important sources commercially. Because of its unique stability in the tetravalent state, cerium can be separated out from the other rare earth elements through oxidation (forming CeO 2) followed by variable solubility filtration.|$|E
