30|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{self-steering}} capability of conventional wheelset mainly depends on the longitudinal <b>creep</b> <b>forces</b> of wheel and rail [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. When the wheelset deviates from the central position of track, the longitudinal <b>creep</b> <b>forces</b> are generated at the wheel/rail contact point due to the conical profile of the wheel tread. With the help of longitudinal <b>creep</b> <b>forces</b> and gravitational restoring forces, the wheelset has the ability to steer itself and return to the central position of track. Thus, the longitudinal <b>creep</b> <b>forces</b> make the conventional wheelset have the self-steering capability in the tangent track and curves [6, 7, 8]. To the author’s knowledge, conventional wheelsets have enough steering capability in tangent lines and curves with large radii. However, they cannot provide enough steering capability to pass through sharp curves smoothly. The reason is that the difference of rolling radius at the contact point is insufficient to compensate the longer path the outer wheel needs; therefore, the outer wheel begins to skid and continuously contact with flange [5, 8]. In addition, the longitudinal <b>creep</b> <b>forces</b> are also the cause of hunting motion for the conventional wheelset. Once the forward speed of the vehicle exceeds the critical speed, the vehicle would experience the hunting motion, extremely threatening the running safety of vehicles.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Contact between {{wheel and}} rail {{leads to the}} creep phenomenon.

Strip theory considers the profiles of the wheel and rail.

40|$|In most {{rail vehicle}} {{dynamics}} simulation packages, tangential {{solution of the}} wheel–rail contact is gained by means of Kalker's FASTSIM algorithm. While 5 – 25 % error is expected for <b>creep</b> <b>force</b> estimation, the errors of shear stress distribution, needed for wheel–rail damage analysis, may rise above 30 % due to the parabolic traction bound. Therefore, a novel algorithm named FaStrip is proposed {{as an alternative to}} FASTSIM. It is based on the strip theory which extends the two-dimensional rolling contact solution to three-dimensional contacts. To form FaStrip, the original strip theory is amended to obtain accurate estimations for any contact ellipse size and it is combined by a numerical algorithm to handle spin. The comparison between the two algorithms shows that using FaStrip improves the accuracy of the estimated shear stress distribution and the <b>creep</b> <b>force</b> estimation in all studied cases. In combined lateral creepage and spin cases, for instance, the error in force estimation reduces from 18 % to less than 2 %. The estimation of the slip velocities in the slip zone, needed for wear analysis, is also studied. Since FaStrip is as fast as FASTSIM, it can be an alternative for tangential solution of the wheel–rail contact in simulation packages...|$|E

In freight operations passive steering three axle bogies have been produced in large numbers for reported benefits including improved adhesion performance and reduced wheel wear.
