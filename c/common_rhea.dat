2500|$|His first {{reference}} to transmutation {{appears in the}} Red Notebook around early March 1837, after John Gould {{told him that the}} <b>common</b> <b>Rhea</b> was a different species to the Petisse. Darwin wrote [...] "Speculate on neutral ground of 2 ostriches; bigger one encroaches on smaller. change not progressif: produced at one blow. if one species altered", proposing a sudden change or saltation in contrast to Lamarck's idea that species graded imperceptibly into each other: later, Darwin referred to this jump as inosculation. He drew on the relationship Owen had shown between fossils of the extinct giant Macrauchenia and the modern guanacos that Darwin had hunted in Patagonia: [...] "The same kind of relation that common ostrich bears to : extinct Guanaco to recent: in former case position, in latter time. .... – As in first cases distinct species inosculate, so must we believe ancient ones: not gradual change or degeneration. from circumstances: if one species does change into another it must be per saltum – or species may perish." [...] Here, he related the geographical distribution of species to their replacement over time, and tentatively proposed that the Rheas had a shared ancestor.|$|E

40|$|Sequential banding {{analysis}} (Giemsa-C-banding-Ag NOR) of chromosomes of the <b>common</b> <b>rhea</b> (Rhea americana) was performed. Metaphases {{were obtained}} by peripheral blood lymphocyte culture and monolayer embryo cell culture. The diploid chromosome number was 80, different from the 2 n = 82 in previous reports. Macrochromosome pairs 1, 2 and 5 were submetacentric and pair 3, subacrocentric. The 4 th pair was acrocentric {{and all of the}} microchromosomes appeared to be acrocentric, {{with the exception of a}} clearly metacentric pair which was fully heterochromatic. The Z was slightly larger than the W, both being acrocentric and C-band negative. Nucleolar organizer regions were observed in the secondary constriction of a microchromosome pair. Correct identification of the NOR-bearing pair was possible only by sequential analyses, Giemsa staining followed by the Ag-NOR technique...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{the current}} study were to collect {{intestinal}} spirochaetes (genus Brachyspira) from farmed and wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and to identify and classify those isolates that phenotypically resembled Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, an enteric pathogen of pigs. The isolation rate of Brachyspira spp. was high from both farmed (93 %) and wild mallards (78 %). In wild mallards, it appeared that Brachyspira spp. {{were more likely to be}} found in migratory birds (multivariate analysis: RR = 1 (.) 8, 95 % Cl 1 (.) 1 - 3 (.) 1) than in mallards sampled in a public park. Pure cultures of putative B. hyodysenteriae were obtained from 22 birds. All five isolates from farmed mallards and ten randomly selected isolates with this phenotype were used for further studies. All isolates from farmed mallards and two of the isolates from wild mallards were PCR-positive for the tlyA gene of B. hyodysenteriae. Two isolates from farmed mallards were selected for pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. These isolates clustered with the type and reference strains of B. hyodysenteriae. 16 S rDNA sequence analysis performed on 11 of the strains showed that they were all closely related to each other and to the B. hyodysenteriae-Brachyspira intermedia cluster. Three of the mallard isolates had 16 S rDNA sequences that were identical to those of B. hyodysenteriae strains R 1 and NIV- 1 previously isolated from <b>common</b> <b>rheas</b> (Rhea americana). To conclude, the isolates from farmed mallards and two isolates from wild mallards were classified as B. hyodysenteriae based on the factthat they could not be differentiated by any of the applied methods from type, reference and field strains of B. hyodysenteriae. The remaining isolates could not be assigned irrefutably to any of the presently recognized Brachyspira species. These results point to a broader host spectrum of B. hyodysenteriae than is generally recognized, and to the presence in mallards of strongly haemolytic and indole-producing spirochaetes that possess many, but not all, of the currently recognized characteristics of B. hyodysenteriae...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} an ESA/ESOC led GSTP activity for an automation project (IDEA) {{consistent with a}} single integrated environment for the preparation of automation procedures. The intention is {{to bridge the gap}} between procedure definition in the offline environment and procedure validation in the execution environment. The project will capitalise on an existing generic product (MOIS) used by all missions at ESOC to create and manage procedures. It will execute these procedures automatically using the MATIS component which in turn interfaces with the ground control systems through a common Service Management Framework (SMF). MATIS was initially developed on a draft of the PLUTO language, modified to support direct use of the SMF services. The SMF offers the services of all the ground control system elements via a <b>common</b> interface. <b>RHEA</b> System’s Manufacturing and Operations Information System (MOIS) is used for the preparation of both manual and automation procedures. The main user-driven objective is to include automated operations seamlessly within the established infrastructure in order to provide a more coherent environment. The technical objectives of the project are to upgrade MATIS to support PLUTO version 1. 0 of the ECSS-E-ST- 70 - 32 C (E 32) standard, to develop a true PLUTO-aware editor conforming to this standard (in Eclipse RCP) and to deploy a Space System Model (SSM) consistent with the ECSS-E-ST- 70 - 31 C (E 31) standard. This will facilitate an abstracted hierarchical classification of the mission data and hide the implementation details of the SMF service layer from the PLUTO scripting interface. While this IDEA project is focused on automation procedures, a complementary MOIS and MORE project [ref 4] will further develop a single integrated environment for all types, including manual and on-board control procedures. The paper will present the project concepts, the design of the software and a demonstration of the new integrated PLUTO procedure preparation and automation system. I...|$|R
6000|$|Turning {{now to the}} ostrich Order: {{the male}} of the common {{cassowary}} (Casuarius galeatus) would be thought by any one to be the female, from his smaller size and from the appendages and naked skin about his head being much less brightly coloured; and I am informed by Mr. Bartlett that in the Zoological Gardens, it is certainly the male alone {{who sits on the}} eggs and takes care of the young. (21. The natives of Ceram (Wallace, 'Malay Archipelago,' vol. ii. p. 150) assert that the male and female sit alternately on the eggs; but this assertion, as Mr. Bartlett thinks, may be accounted for by the female visiting the nest to lay her eggs.) The female is said by Mr. T.W. Wood (22. The 'Student,' April 1870, p. 124.) to exhibit during the breeding-season a most pugnacious disposition; and her wattles then become enlarged and more brilliantly coloured. So again the female of one of the emus (Dromoeus irroratus) is considerably larger than the male, and she possesses a slight top-knot, but is otherwise indistinguishable in plumage. She appears, however, [...] "to have greater power, when angry or otherwise excited, of erecting, like a turkey-cock, the feathers of her neck and breast. She is usually the more courageous and pugilistic. She makes a deep hollow guttural boom especially at night, sounding like a small gong. The male has a slenderer frame and is more docile, with no voice beyond a suppressed hiss when angry, or a croak." [...] He not only performs the whole duty of incubation, but has to defend the young from their mother; [...] "for as soon as she catches sight of her progeny she becomes violently agitated, and notwithstanding the resistance of the father appears to use her utmost endeavours to destroy them. For months afterwards it is unsafe to put the parents together, violent quarrels being the inevitable result, in which the female generally comes off conqueror." [...] (23. See the excellent account of the habits of this bird under confinement, by Mr. A.W. Bennett, in 'Land and Water,' May 1868, p. 233.) So that with this emu we have a complete reversal not only of the parental and incubating instincts, but of the usual moral qualities of the two sexes; the females being savage, quarrelsome, and noisy, the males gentle and good. The case is very different with the African ostrich, for the male is somewhat larger than the female and has finer plumes with more strongly contrasted colours; nevertheless he undertakes the whole duty of incubation. (24. Mr. Sclater, on the incubation of the Struthiones, 'Proc. Zool. Soc.' June 9, 1863. So it is with the Rhea darwinii: Captain Musters says ('At Home with the Patagonians,' 1871, p. 128), that the male is larger, stronger and swifter than the female, and of slightly darker colours; yet he takes sole charge of the eggs and of the young, just as does the male of the <b>common</b> species of <b>Rhea.)</b> ...|$|R
