I am the director of the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute, where we have engaged in extensive research on the topic of prisoner reentry. We have documented the many challenges of prisoner reentry and conducted studies to identify factors that predict both successful prisoner reintegration and recidivism. Among those studies, we have specifically examined <b>D.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>Code</b> felons. We learned that, like their counterparts throughout the country, incarcerated <b>D.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>Code</b> felons return home in need of health care, drug treatment, jobs, and affordable shelter (Hall et al. 2009; Roman and Kane 2006). But <b>D.</b> <b>C.</b> felons face an unusual incarceration experience in that they are typically incarcerated hundreds of miles from their families, potential employers, and postrelease services (Roman and Kane 2006). In fact, over 20 percent of these felons are housed more than 500 miles from their homes (CSOSA 2010). 1 Research points to two reasons that distance from home presents additional challenges for returning prisoners: it can diminish family support and it makes finding treatment and service...|$|R

40|$|Background: Human {{enterovirus}} 85 (HEV 85), whose prototype strain (Strain BAN 00 - 10353 /BAN/ 2000) {{was isolated}} in Bangladesh in 2000, is a recently identified serotype within the human enterovirus B (HEV-B) species. At present, only one nucleotide sequence of HEV 85 (the complete genome {{sequence of the}} prototype strain) {{is available in the}} GenBank database. Principal Findings: In this study, we report the genetic characteristics of 33 HEV 85 isolates that circulated in the Xinjiang Uighur autonomous region of China in 2011. Sequence analysis revealed that all these Chinese HEV 85 isolates belong to 2 transmission chains, and intertypic recombination was found with the new unknown serotype HEV-B donor sequences. Two HEV 85 isolates recovered from a patient presenting acute flaccid paralysis and one of his contacts were temperature-insensitive strains, and some nucleotide substitutions in the non-coding regions and in the 2 <b>C</b> or 3 <b>D</b> <b>coding</b> regions may have affected the temperature sensitivity of HEV 85 strains. Conclusions: The Chinese HEV 85 recombinant described in this study trapped a new unknown serotype HEV-B donor sequence, indicating that new unknown HEV-B serotypes exist or circulate in Xinjiang of China.

Here, we describe the effects of mutagenesis in the human enterovirus 71 (HEV 71) 3 D polymerase on ribavirin resistance and replication fidelity. Seven substitutions were introduced at amino acid posi-tion 3 D-G 64 of a HEV 71 full-length infectious cDNA clone (26 M). Viable clone-derived virus populations were rescued from the G 64 N, G 64 R, and G 64 Tmutant cDNA clones. The clone-derived G 64 R and G 64 Tmutant virus populations were resistant to growth inhibition in the presence of 1, 600 M ribavirin, whereas the growth of parental 26 M and the G 64 Nmutant viruses were inhibited in the presence of 800 M ribavirin. Nucleotide sequencing of the 2 <b>C</b> and 3 <b>D</b> <b>coding</b> regions revealed that the rate of randommutagenesis after 13 passages in the presence of 400 M ribavirin was nearly 10 times higher in the 26 M genome than in the mutant G 64 R virus genome. Furthermore, randommutations acquired in the 2 C coding regions of 26 M and G 64 N conferred resistance to growth inhibition in the presence of 0. 5 mM guanidine, whereas the G 64 R and G 64 Tmutant virus populations re-mained susceptible to growth inhibition by 0. 5 mM guanidine. Interestingly, a S 264 Lmutation identified in the 3 <b>D</b> <b>coding</b> re-gion of 26 M after ribavirin selection was also associated with both ribavirin-resistant and high replication fidelity phenotypes. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the 3 D-G 64 R, 3 D-G 64 T, and 3 D-S 264 Lmutations confer resistance upon HEV 71 to the antiviral mutagen ribavirin, coupled with a high replication fidelity phenotype during growth in cell culture.
