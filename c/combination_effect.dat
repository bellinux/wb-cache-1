50|$|Biocidal {{products}} are often composed of mixtures {{of one or}} more active substances together with co-formulants such as stabilisers, preservatives and colouring agents. Since these substances may act together to produce a <b>combination</b> <b>effect,</b> an assessment of the risk from each of these substances alone may underestimate the real risk from the product as a whole. Several concepts are available for predicting the effect of a mixture on the basis of known toxicities and concentrations of the single components. Approaches for mixture toxicity assessments for regulatory purposes typically advocate assumptions of additive effects;. This means that each substance in the mixture is assumed to contribute to a mixture effect in direct proportion to its concentration and potency. In a strict sense, the assumption is thereby that all substances act by the same mode or mechanism of action. Compared to other available assumptions, this concentration addition model (or dose addition model) can be used with commonly available (eco)toxicity data and effect data together with estimates of e.g. LC50, EC50, PNEC, AEL. Furthermore, assumptions of additive effects from any given mixture are generally considered as a more precautionary approach compared to other available predictive concepts.|$|E

40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, {{hybrid dysgenesis}} {{occurs in the}} {{germline}} of flies produced by crosses between females lacking P elements and males carrying 25 - 55 P elements. We have previously shown that a complete maternally inherited repression of P transposition in the germline (P cytotype) can be elicited by only two autonomous P elements located at the X chromosome telomere (cytological site 1 A). We have tested whether P transgenes at 1 A, unable to code for a P-repressor, {{may contribute to the}} repression of P elements. Females carrying a P-lacZ transgene at 1 A ["P-lacZ(1 A) "], crossed with P males, do not repress dysgenic sterility in their progeny. However, these P-lacZ(1 A) insertions, maternally or paternally inherited, contribute to P-element repression when they are combined with other regulatory P elements.

40|$|Herbal {{formulas}} {{of traditional}} Japanese (Kampo), Chinese and Korean medicines usually comprise multiple herbs {{in a single}} formula. These medicines are expected to show their clinical effects by chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical combination effects of multi-herbs. However, little effort has been made so far to scientifically clarify the nature of such combination effects. Interestingly, for example, though a Kampo medicine Juzen-taiho-to (Shi-Quan-Da-Bu-Tang in Chinese) stimulates the immune functions of Peyer’s patch cells, none of its single component herbs shows such activity. We thus examined the <b>combination</b> <b>effect</b> of herbs in the Juzen-taiho-to formula {{for the expression of}} its immuno-stimulating activity. Juzen-taiho-to, a composite formula of 10 herbs, has been generally considered to comprise two kinds of basic formula, each of which consists of four different herbs in addition to two others. The combinations of herbs based on these two basic formulas were evaluated for their stimulating activities on cytokine production from murine Peyer’s patch cells both in vitro and ex vivo. Combined decoction of six among 10 herbs in Juzen-taiho-to is crucial for the expression of its stimulating activity on Peyer’s patch cells. 3 D-HPLC analysis of the ingredients in the fractions from the combined decoctions indicated that, in addition to quantitative changes of ingredients, alterations occur in their chemical composition by decoction of different herbs. The stimulating activity of Juzen-taiho-to on Peyer’s patch cells results from the <b>combination</b> <b>effect</b> of its six essential component herbs.

The present review presents an overview of evidence currently available on food matrix-derived <b>combination</b> <b>effects</b> influencing the ADME characteristics of food-borne toxic compounds and the possible implications for risk assessment. The results obtained indicate that interactions may occur at all levels of ADME and that the interactions may decrease but also increase the bioavailability and/or toxicity of the compounds of interest. The overview also illustrates that food matrix-derived <b>combination</b> <b>effects</b> should be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account especially the mode of action underlying the interactions and the dose dependency of the effects. Especially food matrix-derived <b>combination</b> <b>effects</b> that proceed by a reversible mode of action, such as for example binding to biotransformation enzymes or transport proteins, may be detected at concentrations used in in vitro assays and at dose levels used in animal bioassays but may be absent at dose levels representing realistic human intake.

Calcitonin inhibited formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells, as mature osteoclasts, by 70 % even at 20 pM, whereas rolipram (10 μM) scarcely affected osteoclast formation; in contrast, the combination of both agents led to significant inhibition of multinucleation and pit formation ability of osteoclasts. The combined administration of calcitonin and rolipram attenuated calcitonin receptor mRNA expression in comparison to treatment with either agent alone, whereas expression of RANK and CSF- 1 receptor mRNAs was unchanged. Alone, these agents scarcely elevated intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration; however, combination treatment with both agents significantly increased cAMP concentration in osteoclast progenitors and osteoclasts. The <b>combination</b> <b>effect</b> was abolished by H- 89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A. It appears that rolipram inhibited hydrolysis of cAMP formed by calcitonin in cells and potentiated the inhibitory effect of calcitonin on osteoclastogenesis.

This study evaluated the effects of a combination of silibinin with either gefitinib or sorafenib on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. MethodsSeveral different human HCC cell lines were used to test the growth-inhibiting effects and cell toxicity of silibinin both alone and in combination with either gefitinib or sorafenib. The cell viability and growth inhibition were assessed using the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, trypan blue staining, and a colony-forming assay. Furthermore, changes in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -related signals were evaluated by Western blot analysis. ResultsGefitinib, sorafenib, and silibinin individually exhibited dose-dependent antiproliferative effects on HCC cells. Combined treatment with silibinin enhanced the gefitinib-induced growth-inhibiting effects in some HCC cell lines. The <b>combination</b> <b>effect</b> of gefitinib and silibinin was synergistic in the SNU 761 cell line, but was only additive in the Huh-BAT cell line. The <b>combination</b> <b>effect</b> may be attributable to inhibition of EGFR-dependent Akt signaling.

We assessed the combined effects of 1 -(o-chlorophenyl) - 1 -(p-chlorophenyl) - 2, 2, 2 -trichloroethane (o,p'-DDT), 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH), and 1, 1 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) - 2, 2, 2 -trichloroethane (p,p'-DDT) on the induction of cell proliferation in MCF- 7 cells. All four compounds are persistent organochlorines that can be found in human tissues. We performed extensive concentration-response analyses with the single agents to predict the effects of two mixtures of all four compounds with different mixture ratios. We calculated the predictions by using the pharmacologically well-founded models of concentration addition and independent action and then tested them experimentally. o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, beta-HCH, and p,p'-DDT acted together to produce proliferative effects in MCF- 7 cells. The combined effect of the four agents could be predicted on the basis of data about single agent concentration-response relationships. Regression analysis demonstrated that there were <b>combination</b> <b>effects</b> even when each mixture component was present at levels at or below its individual no-observed-effect-concentration. We assessed <b>combination</b> <b>effects</b> in two ways: First, evaluations in relation to the proliferative responses induced by single mixture components revealed that the <b>combination</b> <b>effects</b> were stronger than the effects of the most potent constituent.
