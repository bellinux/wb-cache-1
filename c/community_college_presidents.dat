These letters are on file for the public to see. There were concerns from Senator Phil Berger (who was the Republican Leader of the North Carolina Senate at the time), then-Lieutenant Governor Bev Perdue, and North Carolina residents asking the NCCCS board to maintain their admission policy prohibiting undocumented students until they figure out a long-term policy. There were also concerns from the chairman from the Board of Trustees at Isothermal Community College, members from the North Carolina Association of <b>Community</b> <b>College</b> <b>Presidents,</b> members of the North Carolina State University’s Business Committee on Higher Education, the president of the North Carolina Association of Educators, the Director of the Hispanic Ministry, the Chief Executive Officer of the Latino American Coalition, and North Carolina residents who were in favor of changing the policy to allow undocumented students into the schools. To determine a long-term policy that best suits the State of North Carolina and its citizens, the Policy Committee for the State Board of Community Colleges decided that the State Board should employ an independent consultant to study issues surrounding the admission of undocumented students into the North Carolina Community College System. The board voted and approved on September 18, 2008, to have a research study completed by an independent consultant with a budget of $75,000.|$|E
50|$|The second {{president}} was Gary L. Reddig, {{who was appointed}} in July 1980 and resigned on 31 October 1986, giving two reasons. First, he wished to assume the position of director of the County <b>Community</b> <b>College</b> <b>Presidents</b> Association of New Jersey. Second, he alleged that the then chair of the Board of Trustees, Richard J. Ambacher, Jr. (now a professor emeritus of Rowan University), had pressured him to get Ambacher's son a custodial job at the college and his daughter-in-law into the nursing program, which has selective admissions; he also claimed that Ambacher had otherwise interfered in college operations. Ambacher denied the allegations, and stated that he had only asked that the nursing program's admissions standards be altered to avoid bias against non-traditional students. One trustee resigned in sympathy with Reddig. A state investigation resulted in a report and letter recommending {{that the relationship between}} the Board of Trustees and the school be changed (including requiring the college president's approval for hiring done by the board), that trustee quorum requirements be increased, and that trustee training and selection be improved. The investigation did not find Reddig's allegations correct. One member of the Board of Chosen Freeholders asked for Ambacher's term as a trustee not to be renewed; Ambacher responded that this was a political maneuver {{in the context of an}} upcoming election. Ambacher did not seek another term as trustee after his existing term ended in November 1987, stating that this was due to health reasons (diabetes exacerbated by stress). There was considerable dismay at RCGC over these events, especially with accreditation renewal coming in spring 1987.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{case study}} of one state's <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> as an {{organized}} power network. I examine community college leadership as a function of group or class interests and social and institutional environments. Institutional leadership is not seen as the efforts of a single leader in a single institution. This case study uses a Delphi survey and content analysis to explore the general and specific transmission mechanisms of class interests, structural dependence, and power networks. The Delphi survey examined class formation and interests through identifying the consensus ideology held by <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents.</b> Content analysis of the minutes of a statewide community college presidents' organization identified collective presidential concerns and actions. Content analysis of the minutes of local community college district governing boards identified institutional decision making related to collective presidential interests. Together, the Delphi survey and content analyses led to interpretations regarding statewide structural dependence on <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> and their operating as an organized power network, both micro-level social mechanisms involved in system reproduction. I have drawn the following conclusions about <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> and institutional decision making (1) Community college leadership can be understood as the result of group or class interests. (2) <b>Community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> are powerful and dominant actors in the community college system. (3) <b>Community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> can be shown to have organized into elite power networks. (4) <b>Community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> in this case study occupy central positions that have local governing boards, the state board, affiliated associations, and top administrators, {{to a greater or lesser}} degree, in structurally dependent positions.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityCommunity colleges are experiencing many challenges that stem from political and fiscal uncertainties and these challenges are often exacerbated by high turnover in executive leadership positions (Floyd et al., 2010), which has implications for longterm strategic planning. The magnitude of {{the problems associated with}} high turnover rates for <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> prompted the W. K. Kellogg Foundation to award a grant to the American Association of Community College (AACC) in 2003 for the specific purpose of documenting the requisite values, skills, and competencies for community college leaders (American Association of Community Colleges, 2005). The purposes of this study was therefore to add to the body of knowledge on <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents,</b> investigate the factors leading to longevity in tenure for exemplary California <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents,</b> and determine how the competency domains reported by the AACC relate to longevity in tenure for <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents.</b> This mixed-methods study was designed to answer the following research questions: (1) What are the leadership skills that facilitate longevity in tenure for exemplary <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents?</b> (2) What leadership-support structures enhance longevity in tenure for exemplary <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents?</b> (3) What relationships do exemplary <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> create and maintain? (4) What factors and experiences are of significance in preparing exemplary <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents?</b> And, (5) How are the AACC's competency domains related to longevity in tenure for exemplary <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents?</b> Taking a comprehensive look at factors that enhance longevity in tenure for <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> required that qualitative and quantitative data be collected from multiple sources. Consequently, qualitative data were collected from 48 California <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> using a study specific survey instrument. In addition, qualitative data were collected from 48 California <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> using the survey instrument and interviews were conducted with four additional <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents,</b> one retired community college president, one community college chancellor, two community college vice presidents, two board of trustee members, and two faculty leaders. The findings from this research revealed that longevity in tenure for <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> is enhanced by the president’s ability to communicate with individuals and constituent groups, and the president's ability to speak before large audiences. Second, the president's ability to demonstrate a balance between expert knowledge and charisma as well as manage personnel, personnel conflicts, and change initiatives was linked to length in tenure. Third, presidents who have a natural tendency towards being patient with individuals and governance processes that are able to garner support from the board of trustees, professional networks, peer networks, mentors, and constituent leaders tend to have longer tenures as presidents. A fourth theme regarding experiences that enhance longevity suggests that aspiring presidents should spend time in diverse and increasingly challenging leadership roles in the community college system. Fifth, the data revealed that the collection of competencies specified by the AACC is more important with respect to longevity in tenure than the compilation of other skills and competencies identified in an extensive review of the literature. The final finding suggests that there are differences with respect to gender when considering the skills, competencies, and factors that enhance longevity in tenure for exemplary <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>presidents...</b>|$|E
