5|$|Astronomical data {{taken with}} CCDs must undergo several {{calibration}} steps {{before they are}} suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.|$|E
5|$|Double-articulation cranes, {{which can}} load {{at a rate}} of 1,000tons per hour, {{represent}} a widely used method, and the use of shore-based gantry cranes, reaching 2,000tons per hour, is growing. A crane's discharge rate is limited by the bucket's capacity (from 6 to 40tons) and by the speed at which the crane <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> load, deposit it at the terminal and return to take the next. For modern gantry cranes, the total time of the grab-deposit-return cycle is about 50seconds.|$|E

5|$|Ports use Makefile to {{automatically}} fetch the desired application's source code, either {{from a local}} or remote repository, unpack it on the system, apply patches to it and compile it. Depending {{on the size of}} the source code, compiling <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> long time, but it gives the user more control over the process and its result. Most ports also have package counterparts (i.e. pre-compiled binaries), giving the user a choice. Although this method is faster, the user has fewer customisation options.|$|E
5|$|Saudi law recognizes only {{corporate}} or partnership entities established under Sharia or the Saudi Company Law of 1982.

Under Sharia, corporations <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> number of forms, but the most common in Saudi Arabia is Sharikat Modarabah where some partners contribute assets and others contribute expertise. In addition, the Company Law (which is based on Egyptian company law) identifies eight permissible forms of corporate entity including joint ventures, and limited liability partnerships.|$|E
5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. Because the defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because the ball is not snapped. The defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E

5|$|Dragon Quest VII is {{best known}} for its huge size. Without {{completing}} the game's side quests, a single game of Dragon Quest VII <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> hundred hours or more. In terms of gameplay, not much has changed from previous installments; battles are still fought in a turn-based mode from a first person perspective. Although non-battle sequences are rendered in 3D, battles themselves are still portrayed two dimensionally. The ability to talk with the party characters in and outside of battles was added to this game. They offer advice about battle strategies and plot points, or simply comment on how they feel at a given moment. There are four ways and means of locomotion: feet, boat, magic carpet, and skystone. Each of these can move across different terrain.|$|E
5|$|If a cat so chooses, they <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> {{different}} {{calling in}} life {{as that of}} a medicine cat. Medicine cats, unlike warriors, serve for their clan not through bloodshed, but through peace. They are trained to heal their Clanmates by using the natural resources as medicines; for example, cobwebs can be used to stitch deep wounds, whilst poppy seeds are used to lull a distressed cat into sleep. They sleep separately, surrounded by the herbs and resources they need to keep their Clan safe and healthy. Medicine cat apprentices go through a longer period of training than warriors, due to the vast amount of knowledge they must remember. Medicine cats are also not allowed to take any mates or have any kits. This is because they must care for each member of their Clan equally; if they were to form a loving relationship with any one individual, they may unfairly place that cat’s life over that of the Clan. A Clan tends to have only one or two, and occasionally three, medicine cats at any given time.|$|E
5|$|On 27 December 2011, presidential {{spokesman}} Alfredo Scoccimaro {{announced that}} Kirchner {{had been diagnosed}} with thyroid cancer on 22 December and that she would undergo surgery on 4 January 2012. The standard procedure in these operations is to expose the thyroid gland so that a pathologist <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> sample, analyze it looking for carcinogenic cells, and then decide whether it needs to be removed. In Kirchner's case, this step was omitted and the gland was removed directly. After the operation, it was revealed that she had been misdiagnosed and did not have cancer. On 5 October 2013, doctors ordered Kirchner to rest for a month after they found blood on her brain caused by a head injury she received on 8 August 2012. She was re-admitted to hospital and had successful surgery on 8 October 2013 to remove blood from under a membrane covering her brain.|$|E

5|$|Rhythm game, or rhythm action, is a subgenre {{of action}} game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. The genre includes dance games such as Dance Dance Revolution and music-based games such as Donkey Konga and Guitar Hero. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player {{is required to}} press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat. The genre also includes games that measure rhythm and pitch, {{in order to test}} a player's singing ability, and games that challenge the player to control their volume by measuring how hard they press each button. While songs can be sight read, players usually practice to master more difficult songs and settings. Certain rhythm games offer a challenge similar to that of Simon says, in that the player must watch, remember, and repeat complex sequences of button-presses. Rhythm-action <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> minigame format with some games blending rhythm with other genres or entirely comprising minigame collections.|$|E
5|$|Silver has a {{brilliant}} white metallic luster that <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> high polish, {{and which is}} so characteristic that {{the name of the}} metal itself has become a colour name. Unlike copper and gold, the energy required to excite an electron from the filled d band to the s-p conduction band in silver is large enough (around 385kJ/mol) that it no longer corresponds to absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, but rather in the ultraviolet; hence silver is not a coloured metal. Protected silver has greater optical reflectivity than aluminium at all wavelengths longer than ~450nm. At wavelengths shorter than 450nm, silver's reflectivity is inferior to that of aluminium and drops to zero near 310nm.|$|E
5|$|The JD {{program has}} both a {{traditional}} three-year, full-time curriculum or a part-time day program that <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> maximum of six years. Students' initial enrollment can only {{begin with the}} fall term each year. Through a partnership between the College of Law and Willamette's Atkinson Graduate School of Management, a joint degree program is offered to students interested in earning both a JD and an MBA concurrently. The program allows students to earn both degrees in four years instead of five years if completed separately. The business portion {{of the program is}} accredited through the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business and the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration, while the law portion, along with the entire law school, is accredited by the American Bar Association.|$|E

5|$|There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each {{named for}} the county in Wales where it originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their coats, which are water {{resistant}} and shed on average twice a year. The body of the Cardigan is slightly longer {{than that of the}} Pembroke; both breeds have short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground. But they are not as square in outline as a typical Terrier, or have an elongated body as great as that of a Dachshund. There are only minor differences {{in the shape of the}} head, both appear fox-like. The head of a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose. It <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> few days following birth for the true colour of a Corgi's coat to appear, and this is particularly evident in those with tricolour or black and tan markings.|$|E
5|$|After a varying {{amount of}} {{training}} (at {{least a few}} months), apprentices are eventually made warriors. Another naming ceremony is held, this time to mark the cat as being a full member of the Clan. Warriors are given their own unique suffix that often marks their personality or appearance; for example, ‘Graystripe’ would be named after the grey stripe running down his back, ‘Brokentail’ after the kink in his tail, and ‘Sandstorm’ after her fiery personality. It is extremely rare for warriors to meet another cat with the exact same name, but often a warrior will meet another cat with the same first part of their name, and very often will a warrior meet another cat with the same last part of their name (such as fur, tail, or heart). Once named, warriors hold a vigil at night to protect the clan, {{while the rest of}} the clan is sleeping. After the vigil, warriors are free to move into the warrior’s den, where the majority of the Clan sleeps. The duty of a warrior is to protect and uphold their Clan at all costs. They are able to hunt by themselves, and are generally skilled at defending themselves in battle. Warriors <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> mate, and females can give birth to new kits; if this occurs, the expecting mother, known as a 'queen', will avoid warrior duties for six months before returning to them once her kits are made apprentices. The vast majority of warriors are also chosen to later be mentors to new apprentices. Warriors will remain in this position for the remainder of their life, or until they are old enough to retire.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of ways to {{approach}} the game's situations: players can use a violent approach and shoot their way through environments while using cover to hide from enemy fire. Alternately, Adam <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> stealthy approach, avoiding guards and security devices, again using cover to avoid enemy sight lines. Adam can move between cover elements and around corners while staying hidden. The melee takedown system offers lethal and non-lethal options, in addition to an assortment of lethal and non-lethal weapons. Adam can also move the bodies of enemies into hiding places, preventing them from being seen and raising an alarm. A key part of Adam's abilities are augmentations, which can be acquired and upgraded using Praxis Kits either bought from special vendors, found in the game environments, or are automatically unlocked by leveling up: higher-level augmentations require more Praxis Kits to unlock. Augmentation functions can range from passive enhancements to Adam's vision or damage resistance, to active upgrades such as allowing Adam to fall from great heights without being injured or increase his strength. Some augmentations are dependent on Adam's energy level, deactivating after an amount of energy has been drained.|$|E
