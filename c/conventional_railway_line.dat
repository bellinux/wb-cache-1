40|$|Subsidence was {{measured}} {{for the first}} time on railway tracks in the central sector of Ebro Valley (NE Spain) using Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) techniques. This area is affected by evaporite karst and the analysed railway corridors traverse active sinkholes that produce deformations in these infrastructures. One of the railway tracks affected by slight settlements is the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed line, a form of transport infrastructure highly vulnerable to ground deformation processes. Our analysis based on DInSAR measurements and geomorphological surveys indicates that this line shows dissolution-induced subsidence and compaction of anthropogenic deposits (infills and embankments). Significant sinkhole-related subsidence was also measured by DInSAR techniques on the Castejón–Zaragoza <b>conventional</b> <b>railway</b> <b>line.</b> This study demonstrates that DInSAR velocity maps, coupled with detailed geomorphological surveys, may help in the identification of the railway track sections that are affected by active subsidence...|$|E

In the sub-structure of this line, an interlayer was identified that was created mainly by interpenetration of ballast and sub-grade.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the dynamic behaviour of double track simply supported bridges of {{short to medium}} span lengths (10 m < L < 25 m) belonging to <b>conventional</b> <b>railway</b> <b>lines.</b> These structures are susceptible to experience inadmissible levels of vertical vibrations when traversed by trains at high speeds, and in certain cases their dynamic performance may require to be re-evaluated {{in case of an}} increase of the traffic velocity above 200 km/h. In engineering consultancies, these structures have been traditionally analysed under the passage of trains at different speeds using planar models, neglecting the contribution of transverse vibration modes and also the flexibility of the elastomeric bearings. The study presented herein endeavours to evaluate the influence of these two aspects in the verification of the Serviceability Limit State of vertical accelerations, which is of great interest in order to guarantee a conservative prediction of the dynamic behaviour. In the present study, the dynamic response of representative slab and girder bridges has been evaluated using an orthotropic plate finite element model, leading to practical conclusions regarding the circumstances under which the above mentioned factors should be considered in order to adequately evaluate the transverse vibration levels of the deck...|$|R
40|$|In urban areas, {{buildings}} are often constructed adjacent to conventional railway lines, and sometimes train noise poses {{a problem to}} upper floors of those.

Need for noise prediction for upper floors of wayside buildings is increasing in this way, but noise characteristics in high spaces along conventional line are still not identified well. In light of that situation, we carried out noise measurement in different environments including high spaces along conventional lines to identify noise characteristics.

30|$|The first {{high-speed}} railway between Tokyo and Osaka {{went into}} service in 1964 (Tokaido-Shinkansen). This was planned {{as a measure}} to double or even treble {{the capacity of the}} existing <b>conventional</b> <b>railway</b> <b>line.</b> This new line was built avoiding much of the residential and commercial areas along the existing conventional line, enabling quick construction and eventually making it suitable for a high-speed operation. It was designed technically independently from the conventional railway: the line was built with the 1435  mm international standard gauge, electrified with 25  kV AC, and structure and loading gauges larger than one used for the conventional railway. It was easy to justify the construction with this kind of argument given the rapid economic growth and the concentration of industry and population along the Tokyo-Nagoya-Osaka corridor. The same argument was applied to the extension of this line to the west, Sanyo Shinkansen from Osaka via Hiroshima to Fukuoka (Hakata), which commenced service in 1972 (Osaka to Okayama) and in 1975 (Okayama to Fukuoka) [9, 24].|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, {{high-speed}} railways have become an important transportation system due to their high operational speed, and globally, the networks of these railways have been extended.

To contribute to high-speed railway works in Turkey, this study compared two high-speed railway lines; an existing conventional line, the design of which was improved, and a new high-speed line. The design of an existing <b>conventional</b> <b>railway</b> <b>line</b> was improved according to optimal geometric characteristics of high-speed railways and an alternative line was simulated. These two lines were evaluated on three different types of land in terms of the required volume of earthworks, engineering structures and total cost. The results show that the length of the conventional line was reduced after the improvement process; however, new engineering structures are needed. Furthermore, compared to the alternative line, the track length and total length of engineering structures required for the improvement of the existing line was shorter and the volume of required earthworks was less resulting in lower costs...|$|E

40|$|For the 30, 000  km long French <b>conventional</b> <b>railway</b> <b>lines</b> (94 % of {{the whole}} network), the train speed is {{currently}} limited to 220  km/h, whilst the speed is 320  km/h for the 1800  km long high-speed lines. Nowadays, {{there is a growing}} need to improve the services by increasing the speed limit for the conventional lines. This paper aims at studying the influence of train speed on the mechanical behaviours of track-bed materials based on field monitoring data. Emphasis is put on the behaviours of interlayer and subgrade soils. The selected experimental site is located in Vierzon, France. Several sensors including accelerometers and soil pressure gauges were installed at different depths. The vertical strains of different layers can be obtained by integrating the records of accelerometers installed at different track-bed depths. The experimentation was carried out using an intercity test train running at different speeds from 60  km/h to 200  km/h. This test train was composed of a locomotive (22. 5  Mg/axle) and 7 “Corail” coaches (10. 5  Mg/axle). It was observed that when the train speed was raised, the loadings transmitted to the track-bed increased. Moreover, the response of the track-bed materials was amplified by the speed rise at different depths: the vertical dynamic stress was increased by about 10 % when the train speed was raised from 60  km/h to 200  km/h for the locomotive loading, and the vertical strains doubled their quasi-static values in the shallow layers. Moreover, the stress–strain paths were estimated using the vertical stress and strain for each train speed. These loading paths allowed the resilient modulus Mr to be determined. It was found that the resilient modulus (Mr) was decreased by about 10 % when the train speed was increased from 100  km/h to 200  km/h. However, the damping ratio (Dr) kept stable in the range of speeds explored...|$|R
