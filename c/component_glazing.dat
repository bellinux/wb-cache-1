Overview That glass and aluminum frame work together is considered unnecessary in former analysis of UGCW, as the theory of structural analysis referred to the theory about <b>component</b> <b>glazing</b> curtain wall. It is a hot topic that how the glass cooperates with the aluminum frame with further development of the appliance of UGCW and relative studies as well. Some information about whether the glass {{is involved in the}} work of the aluminum frame comes from item 8. 3. 1 in literature [1] only, which is “as lack of enough research findings and working experiences, the beneficial impact of glass to the supporting structure is not considered. ” Thus it can be seen that it’s accepted that the glass is involved {{in the work of the}} supporting structure, however there is no relative study on how they work together.

40|$|The IMAGE (IMplementation of Advanced Glazing in Europe) {{project was}} funded by the European Commission and {{involved}} glass manufactures, consultants and research organisations (see acknowledgements). The aims were to encourage appropriate applications of advanced glazings, to raise awareness of existing products amongst designers and to improve building simulation in relation to combined thermal and lighting appraisal [IMA 1998]. A principal outcome of the project was the release of a PC application 2 ̆ 013 hereinafter termed the IMAGE tool - for use by the glass industry to assess the impact on energy use, thermal comfort, daylight availability, glare, etc. of applying any advanced <b>glazing</b> <b>component</b> to any building type in any climate.

40|$|To aid escape in an {{emergency}} from a vehicle fitted with seemingly indestructible glazing, a laminate system has been developed that permits directional impact failure to be induced in polycarbonate <b>glazing</b> <b>components.</b> Test components exhibit near-full impact resistance when impacted from one side, but fail at much lower energy levels when impacted from the other.

Additional features can be incorporated into the polymer laminate such as extra UV and chemical protection, i. e. areas where polycarbonate is less resilient than other materials. The mechanism of directional failure depends on the outside laminate containing a series of small flaws, generated during the manufacturing process, that close up when impacted from the outside. When impacted from the inside, the outer laminate is placed into tension and these flaws initiate cracks, which propagate rapidly backwards through the component inducing premature failure. The level of inside impact resistance can be varied by altering the processing conditions under which a component is made so that the interfacial strength between the polycarbonate and laminate is weakened...|$|R

However, the differential pressure between the outside and the inner spaces and the supporting pillars create a high pre-existing stress field in the constituent glass during fabrication and hence make the units highly susceptible to breakage, even under small applied loads.

In this system, a VGU is enclosed by two glass panels to form a triple glazing unit system.
