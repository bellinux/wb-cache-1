5000|$|In telecommunication, a <b>combined</b> <b>{{distribution}}</b> <b>frame</b> (CDF) is {{a distribution}} frame that combines {{the functions of}} main and intermediate distribution frames and contains both vertical and horizontal terminating blocks.|$|E
50|$|An {{intermediate}} {{distribution frame}} (IDF) is a distribution frame in a central office or customer premises, which cross-connects the user cable media to individual user line circuits and {{may serve as a}} distribution point for multipair cables from the main distribution frame (MDF) or <b>combined</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (CDF) to individual cables connected to equipment in areas remote from these frames.|$|E

50|$|Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frame</b> (AMDF), (automated {{switching}} matrix, automated <b>distribution</b> <b>frame,</b> Loop Management System (LMS)), {{a technology}} to provide connectivity between subscriber (local loop, outside plant) - and office equipment (inside plant) lines {{in a telephone}} exchange (central office, CO) main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF).|$|R
50|$|A {{complete}} LMS has {{software and}} hardware components. The latter is usually a switch fabric connected both to all required lines and line equipment at {{either side of a}} line. The functionality is similar to one performed by a Main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> or any other <b>distribution</b> <b>frame,</b> so sometimes is referred to as Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frame.</b> A software component implies implementing management operations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Distribution</b> <b>frames</b> {{may grow}} to {{extremely}} large sizes. In major installations, audio <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> can {{have as many}} as 10,000 incoming and outgoing separate copper wires (balanced audio signals require two wires plus earth ground for each signal). Telephone signals do not use a separate earth ground wire, but some urban exchanges have about 250,000 wires on their MDF. Installing and rewiring these jumpers is a labour-intensive task, leading to attempts in the industry to devise so-called active <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> or Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frames.</b> The principal issues which {{stand in the way of}} their widespread adoption are cost and reliability.|$|R
50|$|In telephony, a main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF or main frame) is {{a signal}} <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> for {{connecting}} equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant). The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by jumper wires at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM. Cables to intermediate <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> (IDF) terminate at the MDF. Trunk cables may terminate {{on the same}} MDF or on a separate trunk main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (TMDF).|$|R
50|$|<b>Distribution</b> <b>frames</b> are cheaper, {{but less}} convenient.|$|R

5000|$|Many of {{the first}} {{responders}} to the fire were employees of Bell Companies and Western Electric. Five thousand employees collaborated to restore service. A main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> was ordered and shipped to Manhattan for installation. The main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> typically takes six months to install because its massive framework supports {{hundreds of miles of}} wire. Remarkably, it only took them four days to install. Twenty four days later, service was restored entirely.|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> the MDF {{provides}} {{flexibility in}} assigning facilities, at lower cost and higher capacity than a patch panel.|$|R

50|$|It {{is obvious}} that if {{the means of the}} two normal {{distributions}} are equal then the <b>combined</b> <b>distribution</b> is unimodal. Conditions for unimodality of the <b>combined</b> <b>distribution</b> were derived by Eisenberger. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a mixture of normal distributions to be bimodal have been identified by Ray and Lindsay.|$|R

40|$|A {{structured}} {{expert judgment}} study was organized to obtain input data for a microbial risk-assessment model describing {{the transmission of}} campylobacter during broiler-chicken processing in the Netherlands. More specially, the expert study was aimed at quantifying the uncertainty on input parameters of this model {{and focused on the}} contamination of broiler-chicken carcasses with campylobacter during processing. Following the protocol for structured expert judgment studies, expert assessments were elicited individually through subjective probability distribution functions. The classical model was used to aggregate the individual experts' distributions in order to obtain a single <b>combined</b> <b>distribution</b> per variable. Three different weighting schemes were applied, including equal weighting and performance-based weighting with and without optimalization of the <b>combined</b> <b>distributions.</b> The individual experts' weights were based on their performance on the seed variables. Results of the various weighting schemes are presented in terms of performance, robustness, and <b>combined</b> <b>distributions</b> of the seed variables and some of the query variables. All three weighting schemes had adequate performance, with the optimized <b>combined</b> <b>distributions</b> significantly outperforming both the equal weight and the nonoptimized <b>combined</b> <b>distributions.</b> Hence, this weighting scheme, having adequate robustness, was chosen for further processing of the results...|$|R
