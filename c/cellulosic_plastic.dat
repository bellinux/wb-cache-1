2500|$|The Mk VII was {{different}} from earlier [...]303 bullet designs or spitzer projectiles in general. Although {{it appears to be}} a conventional spitzer-shape full metal jacket bullet, this appearance is deceptive: its designers made the front third of the interior of the Mk 7 bullets out of aluminium (from Canada) or tenite (<b>cellulosic</b> <b>plastic),</b> wood pulp or compressed paper, instead of lead and they were autoclaved to prevent wound infection. This lighter nose shifted the centre of gravity of the bullet towards the rear, making it tail heavy. Although the bullet was stable in flight due to the gyroscopic forces imposed on it by the rifling of the barrel, it behaved very differently upon hitting the target. As soon as the bullet hit the target and decelerated, its heavier lead base caused it to pitch violently and deform, thereby inflicting more severe gunshot wounds than a standard single-core spitzer design. In spite of this, the Mk VII bullet was legal due to the full metal jacket used according to the terms of the Hague Convention.|$|E

30|$|Although wood/cellulose-plastic {{composites}} (WPC) of low wood/cellulose content {{have been}} more accepted worldwide and are promoted as low-maintenance, high-durability building products, composites containing high wood/cellulose content are not yet developed on an industrial scale. In this study, flow properties, mechanical properties, and water absorption properties of the compounds of cellulose microfiber/polypropylene (PP) and maleic anhydride-grafted polypropylene (MAPP) were investigated to understand effects of the high cellulose content and {{the dimensions of the}} cellulose microfiber. The molding processes studied included compression, injection, and extrusion. It was found that fluidity is not only dependent on resin content but also on the dimension of the filler; fluidity of the compound declined with increased fiber length with the same resin content. Dispersion of the composite was monitored by charge-coupled device (CCD) microscope. Increasing the plastic content in the cellulose-plastic formulation improved the strength of mold in addition to the bond development between resin and filler, and the tangle of fibers. The processing mode affected the physicomechanical properties of the <b>cellulosic</b> <b>plastic.</b> Compression-molded samples exhibited the lowest modulus of rupture (MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) and the highest water absorption, while samples that were injection-molded exhibited the highest MOR (70 MPa) and MOE (7 GPa) and low water absorption (2 %).|$|E
30|$|A {{plasticization}} {{method for}} cellulose acetates (CAs) {{has been developed}} {{that is based on}} the reaction with dibasic acid anhydrides and monoepoxides during the melting processing. As a continuation of the discussion in the previous report, additional evidence is presented for the role of grafting oligoesters onto cellulose acetates to prevent the bleeding of homo-oligoesters from the inside of molded articles to their surface. Based on these results, a method for enhancing the amount of grafting has been pursued by varying the combination of dibasic acid anhydrides and monoepoxides. The resulting reactive meltprocessing method allows preparation of biodegradable <b>cellulosic</b> <b>plastics</b> using practical process conditions. Higher biodegradability has been found for the oligoester-grafted CAs than for the unmodified parent CAs.|$|R
30|$|Propionibacterium acidipropionici {{has been}} widely studied for the {{heterofermentative}} production of propionic acid, including fermentation on a semi-industrial scale (Zhu et al. 2010). Propionic acid and its salts are valuable industrial products with several applications such as mold-inhibitors, preservatives for animal and human food, fruit flavorings, additives in <b>cellulosic</b> <b>plastics,</b> and herbicides and medications for animal therapy (Boyaval and Corre 1995). Consumption by the animal world was estimated at 293.4 thousand tons in 2009, representing a market of approximately $ 530 million with an expected rate of 3.9 % until 2014 (Bizzari and Gubler 2004). Currently, industrial production of propionic acid utilizes fossil-based resources. However, the finite nature of oil and the rise in its price increased customer awareness and demand for green products. Furthermore, increased costs waste disposal and restrictions on land filling for certain types of waste led to increased interest in a more sustainable production of chemicals and materials from renewable bio-based raw materials (Tsoskounogiou et al.|$|R
30|$|Cellulose is the {{predominant}} constituent in cell walls of all plants. Cellulose {{is a complex}} polysaccharide with crystalline morphology. Cellulose differs from starch where glucose units are linked by β- 1, 4 -glycosidic bonds, whereas the bonds in starch are predominantly α- 1, 4 linkages. The most important raw material sources {{for the production of}} <b>cellulosic</b> <b>plastics</b> are cotton fibers and wood. Plant fiber is dissolved in alkali and carbon disulfide to create viscose, which is then reconverted to cellulose in cellophane form following a sulfuric acid and sodium sulfate bath. There are currently two processes used to separate cellulose from the other wood constituents (Yan et al. 2009). These methods, sulfite and pre-hydrolysis kraft pulping, use high pressure and chemicals to separate cellulose from lignin and hemicellulose, attaining greater than 97 % cellulose purity. The main derivatives of cellulose for industrial purposes are cellulose acetate, cellulose esters (molding, extrusion, and films), and regenerated cellulose for fibers.|$|R

Currently a variety of industrial produced biopolymers are available such as the bio-based polymers Polylactide (PLA); Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) and <b>cellulosic</b> <b>plastic.</b> Also “Drop In”-polymers are accessible e. g. Bio-Polyethylene (Bio-PE). To make the biopolymers available to more complex applications the material behavior regarding weld lines and binding behavior has to be investigated because the opportunity of weld lines rises with a more complex geometry of parts or more complex manufacturing processes. In case of multi component injection molding {{it is essential to}} know about the bond strength between the different materials. This work compares different thermoplastic biopolymers concerning the strength of hot-hot weld lines and the strength of hot-cold weld lines even in case of different material combinations. Whereas the variation of process parameters (melt temperature, mold temperature) does not show a significant influence of the generally high hot-hot weld line strength the influence on the hot-cold weld line strength is obvious. In case of a biobased PA 10. 10 the tensile strength could be increased from 22 to 38 MPa. To purify {{the look and feel of}} plastics or to increase the resistance against scratches and other environmental impacts hard and/or self-healing PU-coatings are applied on the surface of a basic body. To minimize costs of production and reduce process time in-line surface coating is a valid method. Within these work the bonding strength between biobased thermoplastics and a PU-layer is investigated too...|$|E
40|$|The first remote-handled {{transuranic}} (RH-TRU) {{waste is}} expected to be permanently disposed of at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) during Fiscal Year (FY) 2003. The first RH-TRU waste shipments are scheduled from the Battelle Columbus Laboratories (BCL) to WIPP in order to facilitate compliance with BCL Decommissioning Project (BCLDP) milestones. Milestones requiring RH-TRU waste containerization and removal from the site by 2004 in order to meet a 2006 site closure goal, established by Congress in the Defense Facilities Closure Projects account, necessitated the establishment and implementation of a site-specific program to direct the packaging of BCLDP RH-TRU waste prior to the finalization of WIPP RH-TRU waste characterization requirements. The program was designed to collect waste data, including audio and videotape records of waste packaging, such that upon completion of waste packaging, comprehensive data records exist from which compliance with final WIPP RH-TRU waste characterization requirements can be demonstrated. With the BCLDP data records generated to date and the development by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) -Carlsbad Field Office (CBFO) of preliminary documents proposing the WIPP RH-TRU waste characterization program, it is possible to evaluate the adequacy of the BCLDP program with respect to meeting proposed characterization objectives. The BCLDP characterization program uses primarily acceptable knowledge (AK) and visual examination (VE) during waste packaging to characterize RH-TRU waste. These methods are used to estimate physical waste parameters, including weight percentages of metals, <b>cellulosics,</b> <b>plastics,</b> and rubber in the waste, and to determine the absence of prohibited items, including free liquids. AK combined with computer modeling is used to estimate radiological waste parameters, including total activity on a waste container basis, for the majority of BCLDP RH-TRU waste. AK combined with direct analysis is used to characterize radiological parameters for the small populations of the RH-TRU waste generated by the BCLDP. All characterization based on AK is verified. Per its design for comprehensive waste data collection, the BCLDP characterization program using AK and waste packaging procedures, including VE during packaging, meets the proposed WIPP RH-TRU waste characterization objectives. The conservative program design implemented generates certification data that will be adequate to meet any additional program requirements that may be imposed by the CBFO...|$|R
40|$|This article reports {{production}} of valuables organic acids from the hydrothermal treatment of representative organic wastes and compounds (i. e. domestic sludge, proteinaceous, <b>cellulosic</b> and <b>plastic</b> wastes) {{with or without}} oxidant (H 2 O 2). Organic acids such as acetic, formic, propionic, succinic and lactic acids were obtained in significant amounts. At 623 K (16. 5 MPa), acetic acid of about 26 mg/g-dry waste fish entrails was obtained. This increased to 42 mg/g dry waste fish entrails {{in the presence of}} H 2 O 2. Experiments on glucose to represent cellulosic wastes were also carried out, getting acetic acid of about 29 mg/g-glucose. The study was extended to terephthalic acid and glyceraldehyde, reaction intermediates of hydrothermal treatment of PET plastic wastes and glucose, respectively. Studies on temperature dependence of formation of organic acids showed thermal stability of acetic acid, whereas, formic acid decomposed readily under hydrothermal conditions. In general, results demonstrated that the presence of oxidants favored formation of organic acids with acetic acid being the major product.

40|$|A {{characterization}} of pyrolysis behaviour of different refuse derived fuels (RDFs) under heating rates typical of conventional pyrolysis processes is presented. The results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (d. s. c.) on different RDFs, and on some materials which have been considered 'key components' towards thermal degradation characteristics of RDFs, are reported. The RDF weight loss curve presents two distinct weight loss steps attributable, respectively, to <b>cellulosic</b> materials and <b>plastic</b> degradation. Samples from different plants and different municipal solid waste (MSW) feedstocks show the same qualitative behaviour. In interpretation of the experimental results, the assumption has been made that the pyrolysis rate of thermal degradation of RDF {{can be considered as}} the sum of the rates of the main RDF components: paper (cellulose), wood-like materials (cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose), plastics mainly polyethylene (PE); and that each component contributed to the formation of this sum to an extent proportional to its contribution to the composition of the RDF. On the basis of these data and by means of a simple mathematical approach a method is proposed which provides a simple tool for RDF characterization and, in particular, evaluation of plastic content. A kinetic model has been developed, {{based on the assumption that}} the RDF degradation rate is the weighed sum of the rates of primary reacting species: cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, PE. Simplified kinetic pathways were used for the description of the degradation processes of RDF components. The model allows quantitative prediction of RDF weight loss and char yield at least at the heating rates used in present work...|$|R
