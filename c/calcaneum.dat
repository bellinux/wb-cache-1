5|$|Abelisaurid hindlimbs {{were more}} typical of ceratosaurs, with the astragalus and <b>calcaneum</b> (upper ankle bones) fused {{to each other and}} to the tibia, forming a tibiotarsus. The tibia was shorter than the femur, giving the hindlimb stocky proportions. There were three {{functional}} digits on the foot (the second, third, and fourth), while the first digit, or hallux, did not contact the ground.|$|E
5|$|Like other abelisaurids, the hindlimbs were stocky {{and short}} {{compared}} to body length. The tibia (lower leg bone) of Majungasaurus was even stockier {{than that of}} its relative Carnotaurus, with a prominent crest on the knee. The astragalus and <b>calcaneum</b> (ankle bones) were fused together, and the feet bore three functional digits, with a smaller first digit that did not contact the ground.|$|E
5|$|Developmental biology can {{identify}} homologous structures that {{arose from the}} same tissue in embryogenesis. For example, adult snakes have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for hind legs, which are soon lost as the embryos develop. The implication that the ancestors of snakes had hind legs is confirmed by fossil evidence: the Cretaceous snake Pachyrhachis problematicus had hind legs complete with hip bones (ilium, pubis, ischium), thigh bone (femur), leg bones (tibia, fibula) and foot bones (<b>calcaneum,</b> astragalus) as in tetrapods with legs today.|$|E
5|$|Plateosaurus shows {{a number}} of cursorial adaptations, {{including}} an erect hind limb posture, a relatively long lower leg, an elongated metatarsus and a digitigrade foot posture. However, in contrast to mammalian cursors, the moment arms of the limb extending muscles are short, especially in the ankle, where a distinct, moment arm-increasing tuber on the <b>calcaneum</b> is missing. This means that in contrast to running mammals, Plateosaurus probably did not use gaits with aerial, unsupported phases. Instead, Plateosaurus must have increased speed by using higher stride frequencies, created by rapid and powerful limb retraction. Reliance on limb retraction instead of extension is typical for non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The holotype FMNH PR1821 is {{the only}} fully {{described}} specimen of Cryolophosaurus. The specimen consists of an incomplete skull and mandibles lacking most of their front half; nine maxillary teeth; a fragmentary sixth cervical centrum; cervical vertebrae 7-10; several posterior cervical ribs; several anterior dorsal vertebrae; most mid and posterior dorsal vertebrae; several dorsal ribs; the fifth sacral vertebrae; three chevrons; many partial and complete caudal vertebrae and centra; two partial humeri; a proximal radius; a proximal ulna; a partial ilium; a proximal pubis; both ischia, but only one distal; two incomplete femora; the distal end of a tibia; the distal end of a fibula, and the astragalus and <b>calcaneum.</b> In 2013, new material of Cryolophosaurus was unearthed in Antarctica. The description of this material {{has not yet been}} published in a non-abstract form.|$|E
5|$|The postcranial {{anatomy of}} Heterodontosaurus tucki has been well-described, {{although}} H. tucki {{is generally considered}} the most derived of the Early Jurassic heterodontosaurids, so {{it is impossible to}} know how many of its features were shared with other species. The forelimbs were long for a dinosaur, over 70% of the length of the hindlimbs. The well-developed deltopectoral crest (a ridge for the attachment of chest and shoulder muscles) of the humerus and prominent olecranon process (where muscles that extend the forearm were attached) of the ulna indicate that the forelimb was powerful as well. There were five digits on the manus ('hand'). The first was large, tipped with a sharply curved claw, and would rotate inwards when flexed; Robert Bakker called it the 'twist-thumb'. The second digit was the longest, slightly longer than the third. Both of these digits bore claws, while the clawless fourth and fifth digits were very small and simple in comparison. In the hindlimb, the tibia was 30% longer than the femur, which is generally considered an adaptation for speed. The tibia and fibula of the lower leg were fused to the astragalus and <b>calcaneum</b> of the ankle, forming a 'tibiofibiotarsus' convergently with modern birds. Also similarly to birds, the lower tarsal (ankle) bones and metatarsals were fused to form a 'tarsometatarsus.' There are four digits in the pes (hindfoot), with only the second, third, and fourth contacting the ground. The tail, unlike many other ornithischians, did not have ossified tendons to maintain a rigid posture and was probably flexible. The fragmentary skeleton known for Abrictosaurus has never been fully described, although the forelimb and manus were smaller than in Heterodontosaurus. Also, the fourth and fifth digits of the forelimb each bear one fewer phalanx bone.|$|E
25|$|The holotype, BMNH 46013, {{was found}} in a layer of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation dating from the late Kimmeridgian. The main nodule {{fragment}} contains the pelvis; a series of six posterior dorsal vertebrae, all sacrals and eight anterior caudal vertebrae; a right femur and some loose vertebrae. In all, thirteen detached vertebrae are present in the material. Also an almost complete left forelimb was contained by another loam clump. Additional elements include a partial fibula with <b>calcaneum,</b> a partial tibia, a right neck plate and a left tail spike.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, the Third Asiatic Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, led {{by chief}} {{paleontologist}} Walter W. Granger was hunting for dinosaur fossils in Mongolia. On April 25, assistant paleontologist George Olsen recovered the holotype (AMNH 6554), or name-bearing specimen, of Alectrosaurus, a nearly complete right hindlimb. This included the distal {{end of the}} right femur, the tibia, the fibula, the astragalus, the <b>calcaneum,</b> an incomplete right pes, three metatarsals of the left hind foot, two manual unguals, a manus, and the distal end of the pubis known as the pubic foot. On May 4, Olsen discovered AMNH 6368 approximately 30 meters away from his first find. This specimen included a right humerus, two incomplete manual digits, four fragmentary caudal vertebrae, and other poorly preserved material. These discoveries were made at the Iren Dabasu Formation {{in what is now}} the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Nei Mongol Zizhiqu) of the People's Republic of China. The age of this geologic formation is not clear, but is commonly cited as the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, about 83 to 72 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The holotype, PBMNH.P.10.113.T, {{was found}} in a {{sandstone}} layer of the upper Hell Creek Formation, dating from the late Maastrichtian. It consists of a partial skeleton, lacking the skull, of an adult individual. It contains a piece of a back vertebra, ten tail vertebrae, both humeri, both ulnae, both radii, the first and second right metacarpals, three claws of the left hand, a right thighbone, both shinbones, a left astragalus bone, a left <b>calcaneum,</b> the left second, third and fourth metatarsal, the right fourth metatarsal, and the second and third claw of the right foot. An assigned furcula was later excluded from the specimen. Apart from the remains of the holotype, in the site bones were discovered that also belonged to Dakotaraptor but which represented a more gracile morph. These included the specimens PBMNH.P.10.115.T: a right shinbone; PBMNH.P.10.118.T: a connected left astragalus and calcaneum; and KUVP 152429: originally identified as a furcula, but now also excluded from the known remains of Dakotaraptor. Additionally four isolated teeth were referred, specimens PBMNH.P.10.119.T, PBMNH.P.10.121.T, PBMNH.P.10.122.T, and PBMNH.P.10.124.T. These fossils are part of the collection of The Palm Beach Museum of Natural History. Other referred fossils are KUVP 156045, an isolated tooth, and NCSM 13170, a third supposed furcula later identified as not belonging to Dakotaraptor.|$|E

500|$|Dinocephalosaurus had {{relatively}} large legs terminating in flipper-like feet. The forelimbs and hindlimbs are {{roughly the same}} length, unlike Tanystropheus where the forelimbs are much smaller. Whereas most protorosaurs, such as Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, and Langobardisaurus, had relatively ossified limbs adapted for terrestrial life, the stout limbs of Dinocephalosaurus are poorly ossified and resemble those of nothosaurs. Out of the carpal bones, only six are ossified; similarly, {{only three of the}} tarsal bones are ossified. Additionally, the astragalus and <b>calcaneum</b> also do not articulate with each other in the ankle, instead forming simple and rounded ossifications.|$|E
500|$|The {{wings of}} the greater noctule bat are thinner than those of birds which allow it to {{maneuver}} quickly and accurately. While its wing is delicate and rips easily, {{it is able to}} regrow. The greater noctule is the largest bat in Europe, with a wingspan of [...] Its head-and-body length is from , its tail is from [...] and its forearm ranges from [...] The body mass of adults ranges from [...] The greater noctule bat has been observed as a high altitude flier and a low altitude forager. The dorsal fur of the greater noctule bat is uniformly reddish-brown to dark brown. Its muzzle is broad with enlarged short ears and its tragus is broad, short, and mushroom-shaped. Calcar, also known as <b>calcaneum,</b> is present and it reaches close to midway to the tail membrane.|$|E
500|$|Crocodilians are {{excellent}} swimmers. During aquatic locomotion, the muscular tail undulates {{from side to}} side to drive the animal through the water while the limbs are held close to the body to reduce drag. When the animal needs to stop, steer, or manoeuvre in a different direction, the limbs are splayed out. Crocodilians generally cruise slowly on the surface or underwater with gentle sinuous movements of the tail, but when pursued or when chasing prey they can move rapidly. Crocodilians are less well-adapted for moving on land, and are unusual among vertebrates in having two different means of terrestrial locomotion: the [...] "high walk" [...] and the [...] "low walk". Their ankle joints flex in a different way from those of other reptiles, a feature they share with some early archosaurs. One of the upper row of ankle bones, the astragalus, moves with the tibia and fibula. The other, the <b>calcaneum,</b> is functionally part of the foot, and has a socket into which a peg from the astragalus fits. The result is that the legs can be held almost vertically beneath the body when on land, and the foot can swivel during locomotion with a twisting movement at the ankle.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to these fragmentary teeth, the Maevarano Formation has also yielded a nearly complete, articulated skeleton of an immature, cat-sized mammal {{that has not yet}} been fully described. It is the most complete mammal known from the Mesozoic of Gondwana. Its skull is damaged, but its unusual dentition is preserved. The incisors (two {{on each side of the}} upper and one on each side of the lower jaw) project forwards and are separated from the three or four cheektooth in each side of the lower and upper jaws by a large diastema (gap). It shows primitive features, such as the presence of epipubic bones (in the pelvis), a septomaxilla (a small bone placed between the premaxilla and the maxilla in the upper jaw), and a deep zygomatic arch (cheekbone). On the other hand, it has derived traits like the presence of a well-developed trochlea on the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone), the absence of a rim at the dorsal (upper) margin of the acetabulum (the opening in the pelvis which receives the head of the femur), a small lesser trochanter of the femur (upper leg bone), reduced contact between the fibula (the smaller of the two lower leg bones) [...] and the <b>calcaneum</b> (heel bone), and the dentition. In a 2000 abstract, Krause identified it as a therian (a member of the group that includes marsupials, placentals, and their closest extinct relatives) more derived than the early Cretaceous Vincelestes of Argentina, but in 2006 he and colleagues instead refused to place it in any existing higher-order mammalian group and claimed that [...] "it represents a major new nontherian clade".|$|E

2500|$|Overall, the hindlimb {{is built}} lightly and with long elements, {{contrary}} to the robust, stocky hind limbs of Utahraptor. Dakotaraptor more closely resembles the agile, springy smaller dromaeosaurids {{and would have been}} well-suited at running and pursuit predation. The length of the thighbone is [...] It is relatively shorter and more lightly built than that of Utahraptor. To the contrary the shinbone is rather elongated. The holotype shinbone is, with a length of , the longest dromaeosaurid tibia known. It is 22% longer than the thighbone, indicating a good running capability. The shinbone's cnemial crest has a sharp corner pointing to the front. Its fibular crest ends in a hook-shaped process pointing to above, a condition that is unique in the entire Theropoda. The astragalus and <b>calcaneum,</b> the upper ankle bones, are fused just as in Bambiraptor. The top of the <b>calcaneum</b> has but a small contact facet for the calfbone, indicating that this fibula must have had a very narrow lower end. The metatarsus has an estimated length of , which makes it rather long relative to the remainder of the hindlimb.|$|E

The femur (fe.) answers to the humerus, and is to be distinguished from it by the greater distinctness of its proximal head (hd.) and by the absence of an olecranon fossa from its distal end. The tibia (ti = the radius) is fused for the distal half of its length with the fibula (fb. = ulna). A tarsus (tarsalia) equals the carpus.* Two of the proximal tarsalia may be noted: one working like a pulley under the tibia, is the astragalus (as.); one forming the bony support of the heel, is the <b>calcaneum</b> (ca.). There is a series of metatarsals, and then come four digits of three phalanges each.|$|E
60|$|Section 15. Figure 7 {{shows the}} pelvic girdle and limb of the frog. There is a femur (f.); tibia and fibula (t. and f.) are {{completely}} fused; the proximal {{bones of the}} tarsus, the astragalus (as.), and <b>calcaneum</b> (cal.) are elongated, there are five long digits, and in the calcar (c.) an indication of a sixth. With considerable modifications of form, the three leading constituents of the rabbit's pelvic girdle occur in relatively identical positions. The greatly elongated ilium (il.) articulates with the single (compare Rabbit) sacral vertebra (s.v. in Figure 5). The ischium (is.) is relatively smaller than in the rabbit, and the pubis (pu.) is a ventral wedge of unossified cartilage. The shape of the pelvic girdle of the frog is a wide departure from that found among related forms. In connection with the leaping habit, the ilia are greatly elongated, and the pubes and ischia much reduced. Generally throughout the air-frequenting vertebrata, we find the same arrangement of these three bones, usually {{in the form of}} an inverted. Y-- the ilium above, the ischium and pubis below, and the acetabulum at the junction of the three.|$|E

A projection on the <b>calcaneum</b> bone called the calcaneal tuber is narrow and positioned downward relative to other lateral projections on the bone. The <b>calcaneum</b> also has a facet that attaches to both the fibula bone of the leg and another tarsal, or ankle bone. A hemicylindrical facet on the <b>calcaneum</b> attaches to another bone in the ankle called the astragalus. The astragalus has facets that attach to the tibia and fibula that are adjacent to each other.|$|E
50|$|The {{ankle joint}} of pseudosuchians (including crocodilians) and phytosaurs, passing between the astragalus and <b>calcaneum,</b> is also called crurotarsal joint in the literature. In the skeletons of the phytosaurs {{and most of}} the pseudosuchians this joint bends around a peg on the astragalus which fits into a socket in the <b>calcaneum</b> (the “crocodile normal” tarsus); only in the skeletons of the ornithosuchid pseudosuchians a peg on the <b>calcaneum</b> fits into a socket in the astragalus (the “crocodile reversed” tarsus). Strictly {{speaking}} this ankle is not a crurotarsal joint in the previously discussed sense, as it's situated between the two proximal tarsal bones.
