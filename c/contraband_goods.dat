5|$|Hermann Schoemann {{patrolled the}} Skagerrak to inspect neutral {{shipping}} for <b>contraband</b> <b>goods</b> in October. The ship attempted {{to lay a}} minefield off the British coast {{on the night of}} 12/13 November, with two of her sisters, but had to turn back after she and Z6 Theodor Riedel suffered machinery breakdowns. She made another attempt on the night of 18 December to mine the Humber estuary, together with two other destroyers, but the German ships had to abandon the sortie when they could not pinpoint their location with the required degree of precision. While patrolling in the Jade estuary on 23 December, she collided with her sister Z15 Erich Steinbrinck in a heavy fog. Hermann Schoemann covered minelaying sorties in January and February 1940, but spent most of March under repair for machinery problems.|$|E

She also patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for <b>contraband</b> <b>goods</b> and was also briefly refitted during this time. After completing her refit, Bruno Heinemann and Paul Jakobi were bound for the Baltic via the Kiel Canal when they were attacked by 11 Handley Page Hampden bombers of No. 144 Squadron RAF on 29 September. The British aircraft failed to damage the German ships and five were shot down by Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters.|$|E

5|$|The German {{destroyer}} Z4 Richard Beitzen {{was one of}} four Type 1934-class destroyers {{built for}} the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) during the mid-1930s. Completed in 1937, two years before the start of World War II, the ship spent most of her time training although she did participate in the occupation of Memel in early 1939. At the beginning of World War II in September 1939, the ship was initially deployed to blockade the Polish coast, but she was soon transferred to the Kattegat where she inspected neutral shipping for <b>contraband</b> <b>goods.</b> In late 1939 and early 1940, the ship laid two offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed 17 merchant ships. Richard Beitzen was in reserve during the Norwegian Campaign of early 1940 and was transferred to France later that year where she made several attacks on British shipping.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ship}} {{commissioned}} on 9 April 1932, she {{was assigned to}} the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet. Cygnet {{spent a lot of time}} in dockyard hands during her first two years of service. She was repaired at Devonport in November 1932– January 1933, March–May, July–August and November 1933– January 1934 before deploying to the West Indies with the Home Fleet between January and March 1934. The ship required more repairs upon her return in April–May and then a refit from 25 July to 31 August 1934. Cygnet was detached from the Home Fleet during the Abyssinian Crisis, and deployed in the Red Sea from September 1935 to April 1936. The ship returned to the UK in April 1936 and refitted at Devonport between 20 April and 18 June before resuming duty with the Home Fleet. In July–August she was deployed for patrol duties off the Spanish coast in the Bay of Biscay to intercept shipping carrying <b>contraband</b> <b>goods</b> to Spain and to protect British-flagged shipping during the first stages of the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|All of the E {{class were}} {{assigned}} to the 5th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet upon commissioning during 1934. Following the Italian invasion of Abyssinia, the entire flotilla was sent to the Red Sea in August 1935 to monitor Italian warship movements until April 1936. Refitted upon their return, many were deployed to Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War in 1936–39 to intercept shipping carrying <b>contraband</b> <b>goods</b> to Spain and to protect British-flagged ships. While the F-class ships {{were assigned to}} the 6th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, they followed much the same pattern as their E-class sisters. In April 1939 the 5th and 6th DFs were renumbered the 7th and 8th Destroyer Flotillas, respectively. In mid-1939, newly-commissioned J-class destroyers began to replace the E-class ships and they were reduced to reserve for lack of manpower. Increasing tensions with Nazi Germany in August, caused the British to mobilize the Navy's reserves, which allowed the ships to be manned again and assigned to the 12th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet.|$|E

Because of his tolerance with the <b>contraband</b> of <b>goods</b> and slaves, he {{was subjected to}} a tribunal of grievances, but the case was dismissed. He was demoted and became again Governor of Tucumán (1664-1670). He founded San José de Metán (1665) and fortified the city of Talavera de Esteco to prevent further attacks from the Indians. He conducted a final campaign against Calchaquí Indians, and ordered the exile of 200 families of Quilmes Indians to Buenos Aires.|$|R
5|$|In 1737, Salsette was {{captured}} from the Portuguese by Maratha Baji Rao I and {{the province of}} Bassein was ceded in 1739. The Maratha victory forced the British to push settlements within the fort walls of the city. Under new building rules set up in 1748, many houses were demolished and the population was redistributed, partially on newly reclaimed land. Lovji Nusserwanjee Wadia, {{a member of the}} Wadia family of shipwrights and naval architects from Surat, built the Bombay Dock in 1750, which was the first dry dock to be commissioned in Asia. By the middle of the eighteenth century, Bombay began to grow into a major trading town and soon Bhandaris from Chaul in Maharashtra, Vanjaris from the Western Ghat mountain ranges of Maharashtra, Africans from Madagascar, Bhatias from Rajasthan, Vaishya Vanis, Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Daivajnas from konkan, ironsmiths and weavers from Gujarat migrated to the islands. In 1769, Fort George was built {{on the site of the}} Dongri Fort and in 1770, the Mazagaon docks were built. The British occupied Salsette, Elephanta, Hog Island, and Karanja on 28 December 1774. Salsette, Elephanta, Hog Island, and Karanja were formally ceded to the British East India Company by the Treaty of Salbai signed in 1782, while Bassein and its dependencies were restored to Raghunathrao of the Maratha Empire. Although Salsette was under the British, but the introduction of <b>contraband</b> <b>goods</b> from Salsette to other parts of Bombay was prevented. The goods were subjected to Maratha regulations with respect to taxes and a 30% toll was levied on all goods into the city from Salsette.|$|E

However, as is the case throughout Belize, finances are getting tighter and employment opportunities scarcer, and villagers from Xaibe are not immune to ‘feeling the pinch’. Shop-keepers complain of heightened competition between vendors, a situation made worse by the overall decreasing demand for goods as more villagers are forced to rely on <b>contraband</b> Mexican <b>goods</b> solely to be able to provide for themselves and their families as inflation continues to afflict rural communities throughout our country.|$|R
5000|$|The former Forge Hammer Inn {{adjacent}} {{to the house and}} ironworks was used by smugglers in the eighteenth century to hide <b>contraband.</b> The <b>goods</b> were landed at nearby Pitts Deep Hard and hidden in the cellars of the inn.

[...] "The landlady advanced upon them. Singling out one of the officers who owed her a score for...liquid refreshment, she abused him roundly for not paying his debts..." [...] When the contraband was safe, the landlady admitted the coastguard, who found nothing, and were once more abused for interfering with the business of honest citizens.|$|R
50|$|Yurimaguas {{is notable}} {{for being the}} last urban center in Loreto {{connected}} by highway {{with the rest of}} Peru: a recently paved road links Yurimaguas with Tarapoto and Moyobamba, located in the tropical Andes (high-jungle), or as it is known in the vernacular, the montaña. While the Moisés Benzaquen Rengifo Airport was first established in Yurimaguas in 1937, it is now barely functioning (the collapse of the Peruvian airline Aero Continente left only two airlines serving the airport). For the majority of the populace, transit is dominated by river travel. In the ports of Yurimaguas trade is in tropical forest produce, particularly hardwoods, petroleum, <b>contraband,</b> and <b>goods</b> (licit and otherwise) from the Andean highlands or Pacific Coast sent down-river to Iquitos and beyond (the Port Authority of Yurimaguas, ENAPU {{is in charge of the}} International Puerto de Yurimaguas, Peru).

60|$|So {{much for}} English opinion about America in August last. And now I will venture {{to say a}} word or two as to American feeling {{respecting}} this English opinion at that period. It will of course be remembered by all my readers that, {{at the beginning of the}} war, Lord Russell, who was then in the lower house, declared, as Foreign Secretary of State, that England would regard the North and South as belligerents, and would remain neutral as to both of them. This declaration gave violent offense to the North, and has been taken as indicating British sympathy with the cause of the seceders. I am not going to explain--indeed, it would be necessary that I should first understand--the laws of nations with regard to blockaded ports, privateering, ships and men and <b>goods</b> <b>contraband</b> of war, and all those semi-nautical, semi-military rules and axioms which it is necessary that all attorneys-general and such like should, at the present moment, have at their fingers' end. But it must be evident to the most ignorant in those matters, among which large crowd I certainly include myself, that it was essentially necessary that Lord John Russell should at that time declare openly what England intended to do. It was essential that our seamen should know where they would be protected and where not, and that the course to be taken by England should be defined. Reticence in the matter was not within the power of the British government. It behooved the Foreign Secretary of State to declare openly that England intended to side either with one party or with the other, or else to remain neutral between them.|$|R

In those days, people lived in fear and awe of Karim Lala, the leader of the Pathan gang and Haji Mastan, the smuggler who enjoyed a cult following among the impoverished Muslim youths in south Mumbai including Saabir and Dawood.Soon Saabir and Dawood joined in petty street crime of selling smuggled electronics goods and watches. They often cheated gullible travellers and got involved in street brawls. Saabir, Dawood and their friends called their group, [...] "Young Company". They would hang out near Crawford Market in search of gullible travellers and offer them smuggled Rolex watches for a measely price compared to the actual cost. After the buyer paid them in cash, they would pretend to wrap the watch in a small paper or cloth and tell the buyer not to open it to avoid police suspicion. Actually it would be a stone instead of the watch. They called this activity [...] "alta-palti". If the buyer found out that he had been cheated and accosted them, they would intimidate him with the help of burly Pathan hoodlums from the neighbourhood.Their father requested Haji Mastan to give his wastrel sons decent employment.

60|$|I {{am sorry}} {{to say that the}} modes of {{concealment}} described in the imaginary premises of Mr. Trumbull, are of a kind which have been common on the frontiers of late years. The neighbourhood of two nations having different laws, though united in government, still leads to a multitude of transgressions on the Border, and extreme difficulty in apprehending delinquents. About twenty years since, as far as my recollection serves, there was along the frontier an organized gang of coiners, forgers, smugglers, and other malefactors, whose operations were conducted on a scale not inferior to what is here described. The chief of the party was one Richard Mendham a carpenter, who rose to opulence, although ignorant even of the arts of reading and writing. But he had found a short road to wealth, and had taken singular measures for conducting his operations. Amongst these, he found means to build, in a suburb of Berwick called Spittal, a street of small houses, as if for the investment of property. He himself inhabited one of these; another, a species of public-house, was open to his confederates, who held secret and unsuspected communication with him by crossing the roofs of the intervening houses, and descending by a trap-stair, which admitted them into the alcove of the dining-room of Dick Mendham's private mansion. A vault, too, beneath Mendham's stable, was accessible in the manner mentioned in the novel. The post of one of the stalls turned round on a bolt being withdrawn, and gave admittance to a subterranean place of concealment for <b>contraband</b> and stolen <b>goods,</b> to a great extent. Richard Mendham, the head of this very formidable conspiracy, which involved malefactors of every kind, was tried and executed at Jedburgh, where the author was present as Sheriff of Selkirkshire. Mendham had previously been tried, but escaped by want of proof and the ingenuity of his counsel.|$|R
