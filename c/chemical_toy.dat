The Committees also draw the Commission's attention to the new or emerging problems which may pose an actual or potential threat. They are: the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP), the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) and the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly-Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) and are made up of external experts.

It replaces and updates the 2009 {{version of the same}} standard since the latter and newest has been harmonized under the EU Toy Safety Directive. The new method is a reference test method regulating <b>chemicals</b> in <b>toys</b> and juvenile products. This gives a new test method for 'Experimental sets for chemistry and related activities' under the toy safety EN 71 series.|$|R
25|$|For toy safety, {{every country}} {{has its own}} regulations. But since the {{globalization}} and opening of markets, most of them try to harmonize their regulations. The most common action for younger children is to put toys in their mouths. This {{is why it is}} of utmost importance to regulate chemicals which are contained in the paintings and other materials children's products are made of. Countries or trade zones such as the European Union regularly publish lists to regulate the quantities or ban <b>chemicals</b> from <b>toys</b> and juvenile products.|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason is}} the mistrust of {{products}} made from China. In 2008, The Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD) imposed the ban amid growing fears over the safety of dairy products made in China where four children have died and more than 50,000 have fallen ill after drinking milk tainted with the industrial <b>chemical</b> melamine. <b>Toys</b> and dolls made in China has been found with lead content dangerous to children. Beauty products for females also {{have been found to}} have mercury and lead in them which can cause ailments like skin cancer.|$|R

[...] This {{was the first}} ordinance of its time. The goal of the ordinance was to place pressure on the California State Legislature and national government to follow suit. As a California State Legislator, she continued her work, passing A.B. 1108, which also banned toxic <b>chemicals</b> from children's <b>toys.</b> Her language was later used by Senator Dianne Feinstein in the federal Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, signed into law in 2008.|$|R

Paper Bag Records and Dummy Records premiered Outside via audio streaming on October 16, 2013. They then issued it to digital stores on October 21 and on vinyl on November 18. On May 20, 2014, Paper Bag distributed Outsiders, a set of four remixes of cuts from Outside as well as two B-sides. On July 24, 2014, an official video for [...] "Strange Form of Life" [...] was released.

40|$|Products that {{children}} get {{in contact with}} every day, such as toys, paints, electronics and detergents have recently been discovered that they contain harmful chemicals. Children are more susceptible than adults because of their thin skin and yet not fully developed bodies. The purpose of this work is to identify the risks from chemicals {{that children}} in the indoor nursery get in contact with, and how these products affect the health of children, and to describe how these chemicals affect children's health and the environment. The aim is also {{to find out how}} great the level of the staff's knowledge is about the harmful chemicals, as well as the preventive measures taken.   This is done through a survey among the staff at nurseries in Båstad municipality. The report consists of three parts, two practical parts {{in the form of an}} on-site investigation at nine kindergartens in Båstad municipality and a survey among the staff who worked there. The third theoretical part was in the form of literature.   The results of this study show that the indoor environment in nurseries has important significance for children's health. The inventory of nursery in Båstad municipality showed that today there are goods and products with harmful chemicals among kids at nurseries. The products that have been found in nurseries in Båstad municipality where most contain harmful chemicals such as phthalates, flame retardants, perfluorinated substances and bisphenol A. It was above all the electronic toys such as cell phones, keyboards, computers, and even in the older toys or soft and semi-soft toys.   To reduce the amounts of chemicals found in nurseries one should start to throw away old toys, old electronic toys, avoid toys with batteries or electronics that do not have their batteries covered, stop using cleaning products containing chemicals and also increase the number of times that the nurseries are cleaned thoroughly. The questionnaire study showed that most nurseries were not sufficiently aware of the dangerous <b>chemicals</b> in <b>toys</b> and detergents used. There was a certain part of the staff that was aware of what "green flag" means.   To achieve this is the best way, the municipality, and politicians should help the nurseries. Improvements by the municipality, and politicians should provide important training for both nurseries staff and for the various pictures within the community that directly or indirectly impact. In order to improve knowledge in this area it is needed to train nurseries staff, cleaning staff, parents and others in the business. To get a non-toxic nursery, it is important that the municipality, the nurseries staff, cleaning staff and parents all gain knowledge about chemicals in materials and products...|$|R
40|$|By globalization, {{national}} economies strengthen their ties towards each other; {{the same process}} causes growing interdependence" (Duwendag 2003, p. 119). Internationally agreed standards are regularly called for to guide and direct the process of globalisation. E. g. the German Vice-chancellor (who is also the minister responsible for labour market regulation) warned that profit-orientation threatened democracy if it would not allow for social responsibility of employers (Muentefering 2005). The so-called "capitalism-debate" that arose from those remarks was {{a continuation of the}} "globalization-debate" which has been boosted by globalization critics such as organised in ATTAC but also by an Enquete-commission of the German parliament 1998 - 2002. The debate on international standards, e. g. on conditions at the workplace (labour standards), is controversial from the perspective of policy, of theory and of the empirical-methodological approach. From the perspective of policy, to date it has been proven unfeasible to establish a framework that balances the responsibilities and options of interventions between national and international policy bodies. Some argue that the establishment of such a framework is principally impossible and thus an argument against international labour standards. Others take the view that the world is moving towards such a framework, although slowly so. Among others, founding of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in 1919 was based on the rationale of international labour standards (see Schmidt 2005 a, pp 88 - 91). Some count the debate about and eventual abolition of slavery as a "labour standard success story" (e. g. Elliot and Freeman 2003). The policy perspective shall be explored no further here. From the perspective of theory, "classical" economists have always uphold the view that market outcomes should be the point of reference ("standard") and that these would eventually be welfare-enhancing. However, this view has been challenged by broader perspectives, e. g. that of institutional economics (see e. g. Schmidt 2005 b). It is the empirical-methodological perspective that shall be explored in the following paper. It is argued that advocates of politically agreed upon standards base their point of view usually on case studies. On the other hand, proponents of the "market-outcome-approach" point to quantitative studies which overwhelmingly find a positive relationship between globalization and labour standards (see Schmidt 2005 a, pp. 53 - 57 for an overview over quantitative literature). The remainder of the paper organises as follows: Section 2 invites the reader to reflect a moment on the understanding of globalization. Whereas many conclusions about the impact on globalisation are really only about a single channel, globalisation is a multi-channel-phenomenon that can not be understood from one channel alone. Section 3 outlines three exemplary case studies – <b>chemical</b> (BASF), <b>toys</b> (Mattel), furniture (IKEA) – to show the necessity as well as the complexity of politically agreed upon standards. Section 4 discusses challenges of measuring labour standards in quantitative studies. A suggestion to meet those challenges, drawing on two new indicators, is presented in section 5. Section 6 concludes. ...|$|R
