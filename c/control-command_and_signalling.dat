The deployment of the new signaling system (ERTMS) across heterogeneous institutional and technical environments raises diverse issues. These are empirically analyzed by taking the case of the ERTMS corridor D (Valencia-Budapest) with a special concern for cross-border sections and the role a specif-ically designed micro-institution plays in ruling this priority project.

40|$|Level {{crossing}} (LC) {{safety is}} a crucial issue for railway operators and infrastructure managers. Accidents at LCs give rise to serious material and human damage, while seriously impacting the reputation of railway safety. In particular, some typical scenarios are behind {{the main part of}} train-car collisions which occur at LCs. On the other hand, ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System) is the standard railway <b>control-command</b> <b>and</b> <b>signaling</b> system being currently implemented throughout Europe and elsewhere. The aim is to ensure railway interoperability while enhancing safety and competitiveness of railway transportation. ERTMS specifications only provide a rough description when dealing with level crossing control. The present study elaborates on a functional control architecture for automatic LCs in the context of ERTMS operation Levels 2 and 3. Indeed, these operation levels ensure a continuous knowledge of train location thanks to the GSM-R (Global System for Mobile communications - Railways) link between the trains and the Radio Block Center (RBC). Hence, the established LC control scheme aims to ensure an optimal LC command based on the information regarding the train location and, thereby, prevent some potential risky scenarios and improve the global safety at LCs. To achieve this, a generic methodology is employed. Firstly, a formal behavioral model is developed using the Time Petri Net (TPN) notation. Then, the problem is formalized {{on the basis of the}} established TPN, in such a way as to carry out a sound and trustworthy analysis. The various steps of the developed approach are detailed and illustrated in the course of the paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that seeks to elaborate a control strategy of automatic LC in the ERTMS operation context...|$|R
40|$|ERTMS is the {{standard}} railway <b>control-command</b> <b>and</b> <b>signaling</b> system which aims to ensure railway interoperability throughout Europe while enhancing safety and competitiveness. ERTMS is composed of two main subsystems which include GSM-R, a radio system for enabling communication between the train and the traffic management center and ETCS, an automatic train protection system (ATP) to replace the existing national ATP systems. The ERTMS specifications are defined by means of standard documents which set out the requirements ensuring interoperability. These documents evolve regularly to give rise to successive versions. The ERTMS/ETCS standard defines different levels and operation modes according to various trackside and onboard setups and some operational conditions. Given the complexity and the high criticality of railway operation, verification and validation (V&V) are crucial tasks in railway application development. In this paper, after setting the background and the motivations, a mechanizable formalization of a subset of ERTMS/ETCS specifications relative to ETCS modes and transitions is developed. The present work aims to offer a readily available model for formal V&V. Using formal techniques to check SRS is highly recommended to tackle {{the complexity of the}} defined requirements and prevent specification errors. Model-checking technique, which is targeted here, offers exhaustive analysis of the system behavior based on its model and is highly automated, since it is supported by software tools. Based on the last available version of SRS specifications, a progressive process is undertaken to get a formal model which makes explicit the various modes characterized by their respective active functions, as well as the numerous combinations of conditions for switching between modes. The various steps guiding the translation of the SRS literal specifications into a formal model are explained. As will be shown through different examples, the obtained model is a convenient basis to check safety, interoperability and liveness properties...|$|R
40|$|For {{advanced}} {{clinical and}} biometrics applications, various implantable neural sensors are fabricated by CMOS-LSI technologies [1, 2]. However the CMOS device {{has a large}} flicker noise and deviation of threshold voltage, CMOS Operational-amplifier (Opamp) hardly amplifies a weak neural signal. Thus the system has to implement a low-noise amplifier which can reduce these noises. Moreover, the implantable systems need a reception of system <b>control-commands</b> <b>and</b> a transmission of sensor data using a wireless communication. In this paper, we propose the architecture of a neural sensing system, which includes low-noise amplifier and wireless transceiver implemented with a conventional CMOS technology.

30|$|Wireless {{communication}} systems are key solutions for metro applications to carry, {{at the same}} time, with different priorities, data related to <b>control-command</b> <b>and</b> train operation and exploitation. Driverless underground systems {{are one of the}} best examples of the use of such wireless radio system deployments based on WLAN, standards generally in the 2.45 or 5.8 GHz bands (New York, line 1 in Paris, Malaga, Marmaray, Singapore, Shangaï, etc.). These systems require robustness, reliability and high throughputs in order to answer {{at the same time the}} safety and the QoS requirements for data transmission. They must verify key performance indicators such as minimal electric field levels in the tunnels, targeted bit error rates (BER), targeted handover times, etc. Consequently, metro operators and industries need efficient radio engineering tools to model the electromagnetic propagation in tunnels for radio planning and network tuning. In this article, we propose an original method based on a Ray Launching method to model the electromagnetic propagation at 5.8 GHz in tunnels with curved cross section or curved main direction. The article is organized as follows. Section 2 details existing studies on this topic. Section 3 presents the developed method. A comparison of our results with the ones obtained in the literature is performed in Section 4 for a straight arch-shaped tunnel. Our method is then confronted to measurements at 5.8 GHz and validated in a curved rectangular tunnel in Section 5. A statistical analysis of simulated results in a curved rectangular tunnel is then performed in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes the article and gives some perspectives.|$|R

They show that measurement <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> processing problems of now-a-days open new dimensions for the interpretation of the basic concepts of measurement <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> processing <b>and</b> make the reevaluation of these concepts necessary. Traditional methods fail in many cases to yield useful solutions, especially when measurement <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> processing problems reveal considerable complexity, involve a wide spectrum of various disciplines and require a multitude of components and methods. Since traditional methods, without a proper resource management supported at the system level, seem inappropriate to solve such problems, qualitatively new methods are needed.

It gives a brief overview of various imprecise computational methods and discusses their applicability to treat complex measurement <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> processing problems. 1...|$|R
