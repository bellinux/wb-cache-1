40|$|This {{analysis}} compares {{nursing home}} costs, Medicaid payment rates, and profits under three Medicaid nursing home payment systems: case-mix, facility-specific, and <b>class-rate</b> systems. Data used {{were collected from}} 135 nursing homes in seven states. The association of case mix with costs, rates, and profits under the three payment systems was of particular interest. Case mix was more strongly associated (positively) with patient care cost and the Medicaid rate for the case-mix systems than for the other systems, particularly the <b>class-rate</b> systems. In contrast, case mix and profits were not associated in the case-mix or facility-specific systems, but were negatively associated in the class rate systems. Overall, {{the results suggest that}} case-mix systems have some important advantages over other payment systems, but further research is needed on larger samples and involving the newer case-mix systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} it is illustrated, in a {{practical}} way, the use of three tools that permit the actuary to define tariff groups and to estimate risk premiums in the <b>class-rating</b> process for non-life insurance. The first is the segmentation analysis (CHAID and XAID) used firstly at 1997 by UNESPA in its common portfolio of automobiles. The second is a stepwise selection process with the distance-based regression model. And the third is a process with the well known generalized linear regression model, which represents the most modern technique in the actuarial bibliography. From the later, if we combine different link functions and error distributions, we can obtain the classical additive and multiplicative models. segmentation analysis, risk profiles, <b>class-rating,</b> non-life insurance, models, generalized linear models, distance-based, credibility models...|$|R
50|$|Despite {{its many}} improvements, the Prescott {{core of the}} Celeron D {{had at least one}} major {{drawback}} - heat. Unlike the fairly cool-running Northwood Celeron, the Prescott-256 had a <b>class-rated</b> TDP of 73 W, which prompted Intel to include a more intricate copper core/aluminum finned cooler to help handle the additional heat.|$|R

The {{products are}} tested and approved for use in A class and H <b>class-rated</b> sections according to IMO Resolution A.754 (18) and SOLAS. They are also certified by various classification societies such as Lloydâ€™s, ABS, Bureau Veritas and DNV GL.|$|R
5000|$|Different {{types of}} private {{licences}} are issued {{for the major}} categories of aircraft. It is possible to obtain a category/class rating for rotorcraft or lighter-than-air aircraft without ever obtaining a rating on fixed-wing aircraft. Some category/class ratings may include limitations placed on the certificate. For example, a glider pilot who has trained and tested using aerotow-, ground- or self-launch techniques will have a limitation placed on his glider rating [...] "______-launch only" [...] until he has completed additional training and a practical exam using the additional launch method(s). In similar fashion, a lighter-than-air pilot with a balloon <b>class-rating</b> will have the limitation [...] "limited to hot air balloons with airborne heater" [...] or [...] "limited to gas balloons" [...] unless he has logged flight training and completed a practical exam on both types of balloon. Other limitations may occasionally be issued, however these are not commonly encountered. The classes listed on the certificate define which aircraft categories its holder is qualified to operate.|$|R
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that cigarette use declines when women find out they are pregnant, increasing {{again after the}} birth. Pregnancy may provide many women with the impetus to stop smoking. Also, rates of smoking cessation and reduction may be <b>class-rated,</b> with the highest socio-economic status group manifesting higher rates of reduction. Using data from the Mater Hospital- University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy, it is reported that family income is related to rates of smoking before, during and after pregnancy. Before becoming pregnant, 45. 9 % {{of women in the}} sample were smokers. This declined to 34. 7 % of women at their 1 st clinic visit. Rates of heavy smoking had returned to earlier levels by the 6 th month (after birth) follow-up. Smoking cessation relapse rates were highest in the highest family-income group, but relapse rates after the birth were similar for all income groups. Arresting rates of smoking relapse by pregnant women should be seen as a major public health priority. CIGARETTE smoking by pregnant women remains a significant public health issue. Women smokers increase the risk to their own health, and they expose their unborn children to the risk of developmental and other health problems. Given the duality of this risk and the finding tha...|$|R
40|$|Insurers face growing {{difficulties}} with insuring food-related risks among others {{due to an}} increasing number of product recalls and an increasing amount of claims being pushed back into the chain. This paper focuses on the risk of product recall in dairy supply chains. The paper aims at providing insurers with useful tools for insurance design and claim handling. More specifically, the objectives of this paper are (1) to define product recall, aimed at recognizing recall perils and losses; (2) to identify important precautionary action points and related control measures, for underwriting and <b>class-rating</b> purposes; (3) to develop a risk assessment framework, as a tool for calculating premium levels; and (4) to evaluate third-party verifiability of due diligence, aimed at identifying eligibility for insurance payments. Precautionary action points are prioritized with adaptive conjoint analysis. In the risk assessment framework, case studies are used to quantify the size of losses. Additionally, throughout the paper, expert consultation has been an important source of information. Results show that perils and losses of product recall need to be strictly defined, preferably on a case-by-case basis. Also, case studies show that recall losses easily cumulate as losses are yet between Euro 210, 000 and Euro 2, 300, 000 for {{only a limited number of}} recall expenses and contaminated products. Furthermore, in relation to the third-party verifiability of due diligence, difficulties are encountered at the farm level. We conclude that, if risks are properly defined and insurance schemes incorporate adequate due diligence and disclosure incentives for all chain participants, product recall remains an insurable type of risk, even if the number of recalls will further increase...|$|R
