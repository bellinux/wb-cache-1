5|$|In {{this night}} battle the 64th Field Artillery Battalion, {{supporting}} the 1st Battalion, became {{directly involved in}} the fighting. About 50 North Koreans infiltrated before dawn to A Battery's position and assaulted it.

Anderson and his men fought hand-to-hand combat with the North Koreans. Some of the guns fell temporarily into North Korean hands but the artillerymen repulsed the attack, aided by the concentrations of fire from <b>C</b> <b>Battery,</b> 90th Field Artillery Battalion nearby, which cut off the North Koreans from reinforcements. In defending its guns in this night battle, A Battery lost seven men killed and 12 wounded.|$|E

25|$|About 2100 hours, as 2nd Battalion, <b>C</b> <b>Battery</b> of the 555th, and {{the trains}} were forming on the road, Kean ordered the commanders {{to move the}} 2nd Battalion and one battery of {{artillery}} through the pass immediately, but to hold {{the rest of the}} troops in place until daylight. Immediately, the 2nd Battalion moved through the pass, and once over it was out of communication {{with the rest of the}} regiment. In effect, though the 2nd Battalion thought it was the advance guard of the rest of the regiment, it was on its own and neither force could assist the other if it came under attack. In the movement of the 2nd Battalion and C and Headquarters Batteries, Daly was wounded a second time and was evacuated. The 2nd Battalion cleared the pass before midnight. On the west side it came under light attack but was able to continue its advance all the way to Taejong-ni, where it held position for the rest of the night.|$|E

After the arrival of the 2–7 CAV and the remainder of the 39th BCT main body, 1–206th FA provided fires in support of 39th Brigade Combat Team operations; served as the base defense operations center (BDOC); manned the main entry control point, Gunner Gate; provided the camp's quick reaction force (QRF); conducted convoy and VIP escorts; and, trained, equipped and organized the 307th Iraqi National Guard Battalion.

25|$|All CONUS Hercules batteries, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the ones in Florida and Alaska, were deactivated by April 1974. The remaining units were deactivated during the spring of 1979. Dismantling of the sites in Florida – Alpha Battery in Everglades National Park, Bravo Battery in Key Largo, Charlie Battery in Carol City and Delta Battery, located on Krome Avenue on the outskirts of Miami – started in June 1979 and was completed by early autumn of that year. The buildings that once housed Delta Battery became the original structures used for the Krome Avenue Detention Facility, a federal facility used primarily to hold illegal aliens awaiting immigration hearings. In Anchorage, Alaska, Site Point (A Battery) was converted into a ski chalet for Kincaid Park. Site Summit (B Battery) still sits above Eagle River, its IFC buildings and clamshell towers easily visible when driving towards Anchorage.
