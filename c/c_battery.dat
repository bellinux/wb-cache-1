5|$|In {{this night}} battle the 64th Field Artillery Battalion, {{supporting}} the 1st Battalion, became {{directly involved in}} the fighting. About 50 North Koreans infiltrated before dawn to A Battery's position and assaulted it.

Anderson and his men fought hand-to-hand combat with the North Koreans. Some of the guns fell temporarily into North Korean hands but the artillerymen repulsed the attack, aided by the concentrations of fire from <b>C</b> <b>Battery,</b> 90th Field Artillery Battalion nearby, which cut off the North Koreans from reinforcements.

25|$|About 2100 hours, as 2nd Battalion, <b>C</b> <b>Battery</b> of the 555th, and {{the trains}} were forming on the road, Kean ordered the commanders {{to move the}} 2nd Battalion and one battery of {{artillery}} through the pass immediately, but to hold {{the rest of the}} troops in place until daylight. Immediately, the 2nd Battalion moved through the pass, and once over it was out of communication {{with the rest of the}} regiment. In effect, though the 2nd Battalion thought it was the advance guard of the rest of the regiment, it was on its own and neither force could assist the other if it came under attack. In the movement of the 2nd Battalion and C and Headquarters Batteries, Daly was wounded a second time and was evacuated. The 2nd Battalion cleared the pass before midnight.
