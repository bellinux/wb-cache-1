40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the association of}} comprehensive health of elderly highlanders in Qinghai in China with biological and cultural adaptation to hypoxic environment. Methods: Activities of daily living (ADL), screening-based depression, quality of life (QOL) and checking-up of metabolic syndrome including community-based oral glucose tolerance test were assessed in 393 community-dwelling elderly subjects in Haiyuan and 219 Tibetan highlanders in YuShyu. Results: Tibetan elderly highlanders were more disabled in ADL, but had higher QOL <b>than</b> <b>Han</b> elderly ones in Haiyuan. Blood pressure measurements, rate of hypertension and hemoglobin concentrations in Tibetan elderly highlanders were lower <b>than</b> <b>Han</b> ones in Haiyuan. Despite of lower ADLs, subjective QOLs in Tibenatn elderly was higher <b>than</b> <b>Han</b> elderly in Haiyuan. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome was higher and scores in ADL was lower in Tibetan elderly in YuShyu than those in Haiyuan. Conclusion: Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in elderly highlanders in Haiyuan was not still high even now, however, that in YuShyu was increasing. Further investigation on physiological adaptability to hypoxic environment and human ageing phenomena in global context may open new research frontier for ageing science...|$|R

40|$|Disparities {{in length}} of {{schooling}} between the largest Muslim minority in China, the Hui, and the Han majority are investigated.

Particularly noteworthy is that as many as 45 percent of adult rural Hui females are not literate. Possible reasons for the shorter educations of Hui in many segments of the population are numerous. We show that the incentive to invest in length of schooling is smaller among Hui <b>than</b> <b>Han</b> as the association between education and income is weaker. We also report that Hui parents spend fewer resources on education <b>than</b> <b>Han</b> parents and that fewer years of schooling for Hui in the first generation helps to explain why Hui persons in the second generation have shorter educations...|$|R

30|$|From an {{analysis}} on the macro-level using census data, such as structures of educational achievement and the occupational compositions of labor, and from my personal experiences of interviewing local cadres {{and people in the}} western regions, the “marginalization” of minority groups during the last 10 years has been aggravated by such attitudes and practices. During 2000 - 2010, for example, the percentage of Uyghurs who are “leaders in the offices of the Party, the government and enterprises” relative to all employed Uyghurs above the age of 16, decreased from 0.84 % to 0.47 %, while the absolute number decreased 32.3 % (Ma, 2013 a). A similar situation can also be observed among Mongolians and Tibetans. These statistics reflect a trend toward the marginalization of minority cadres. The percentage of Uyghur professionals (doctors, teachers, scholars, etc.) and workers in manufacturing and construction among all employed populations decreased prominently as well. The employment issues of Uyghur and Tibetan college graduates are much more severe <b>than</b> <b>Han</b> graduates. The difficulty western minority members in urban parts of China have in finding employment and making an adequate living is much greater <b>than</b> <b>Han</b> migrant laborers. Meanwhile, the gap in faculty, teaching and research achievements between universities {{in the western part of}} China and those in the east coastal cities is enlarging.|$|R

30|$|The {{negative}} attitude some Han people in minority regions have toward local minorities comes partly from their discontent with “privilege policies for minorities”. For example, some Han think that preferential policies such as weighted scores that favor minority students’ university entrance exams are not fair. I frequently hear from Uyghur students coming from Xinjiang that Han in inland China {{are much more}} friendly <b>than</b> <b>Han</b> in Xinjiang. One reason for this might be that the latter feels that they and their children are discriminated against by such Xinjiang minority preferential policies. The minority students with scores {{more than one hundred}} points lower <b>than</b> <b>Han</b> students, for example, are admitted to key national universities, while the Han students fail to gain university admission and instead have to find work (Ma Rong, 2009). Psychologically, they feel this sharp contrast is unacceptable. The same type of situation can be observed from the judicial policy of “two less and one lenient (两少一宽)”. 2 In the same way we used to ask Han members to understand the minority’s situation and feelings from their positions, I would suggest members of minority groups also try to understand the feelings of Han and their situations from their positions. With such a transposition, when some minority scholars strongly propose to reinforce further privilege policies toward minorities, they should be more circumspect. Only when we are empathic toward each other, can we understand each other.|$|R

MTB isolates from aborigines and Han Chinese living in eastern and southern Taiwan, the major regions of aborigines, were analyzed by spoligotyping and 24 -loci MIRU-VNTR. In eastern Taiwan, 60 % of aboriginal patients were # 20 years old, significantly younger than the non-aboriginal patients there; aborigines {{were more likely to have}} clustered MTB isolates <b>than</b> <b>Han</b> Chinese (odds ratio (OR) = 5. 98, p, 0. 0001). MTB lineages with high clustering were EAI (54. 9 %) among southern people, and Beijing (62. 5 %) and Haarlem (52. 9 %) among eastern aborigines. Resistance to first-line drugs and multidrug resistance (MDR) were significantly higher among eastern aborigines ($ 15 %) than in any other geographic and ethnic group (p, 0. 05); MDR was detected in 5 of 28 eastern aboriginal patients # 20 years old. Among patients from the eastern region, clustered strains (p = 0. 01) and aboriginal ethnicity (p = 0. 04) were independent risk factors for MDR.

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} aimed to {{estimate}} prevalence of hypertension among adults in rural remote areas of Xinjiang, China {{and evaluate the}} associated factors of hypertension. Methods: The survey was based on questionnaire interviews and clinical measurements of 11, 340 individuals (≥ 18 years old), and was conducted during 2009 – 2010 via a stratified cluster random sampling method in the remote rural areas of Xinjiang, about 4407 km away from the capital Beijing. Hypertension was defined according to WHO/ISH criteria. Results: Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of the population were (126. 3 ± 21. 4) and (80. 9 ± 13. 4) mmHg. Compared with Han nationality subjects, SBP and DBP of Kazakh nationality subjects were significantly high (p < 0. 05), while the SBP and DBP of Uyghur subjects were significantly low (Kazakh: (128. 7 ± 23. 9) and (83. 0 ± 14. 6) mmHg, Uyghur: (123. 6 ± 19. 3) and (77. 4 ± 12. 7) mmHg, Han: (126. 5 ± 20. 5) and (82. 6 ± 11. 9) mmHg, p < 0. 05). Prevalence of hypertension {{of the population was}} 32. 1 %, and was greater among Kazakhs and lower among Uyghur <b>than</b> <b>Han</b> (Kazakh: 36. 9 %, Uyghur: 26. 1 %, Han: 33. 7 %, p < 0. 05). The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 30. 2 %, and was greater among Kazakhs while lower among Uyghurs <b>than</b> <b>Han</b> subjects (Kazakh: 37. 0 %, Uyghur: 26. 0 %, Han: 33. 8 %, p < 0. 05, p < 0. 05). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed Gender (OR = 1. 324), age (OR = 2. 098, 3. 681, 6. 794, 9. 473, 14. 646), nationality (OR = 1. 541), occupation (OR = 1. 659, 1. 576), education (OR = 1. 260), BMI (OR = 1. 842), WC (OR = 1. 585), WHR (OR = 1. 188), WHR (OR = 1. 188), diabetes (OR = 1. 879), hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 1. 361), hypercholesterolemia (OR = 1. 131) and high blood low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (OR = 1. 956) were all positively correlated with hypertension, while low blood high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (OR = 0. 765) was negatively correlated with hypertension. Conclusions: Prevalence of hypertension among adults in remote rural areas of Xinjiang was higher than the national average. Prevalence of hypertension was greater among Kazakhs and lower among Uyghurs <b>than</b> <b>Han</b> nationals, thus indicating significant differences between regions and nationalities. Gender, age, nation, occupation, education, overweight or obesity, abdominal obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, high LDL-C were positively correlated with hypertension, low HDL-C was negatively correlated with hypertension...|$|R
