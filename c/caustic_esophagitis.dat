40|$|Benign esophageal lesions {{occur in}} various diseases. Barium studies {{are useful for}} the {{evaluation}} of mucosal surface lesions but provide little information about the extramucosal extent of disease. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, on the other hand, permit the assessment of wall thickness, mediastinal involvement, adjacent lymphadenopathy, and distant spread. In diseases such as fibrovascular polyps, duplication cysts, scleroderma, trauma, <b>caustic</b> <b>esophagitis,</b> hiatal hernia, esophageal diverticulum, achalasia, and paraesophageal varices, the findings of imaging studies are specific, obviating the need for further invasive diagnostic work-up. The advent of helical computed tomography and its volume data set allows the acquisition of multiplanar images, and magnetic resonance imaging is useful both for this and for tissue characterization. Thus, multiplanar cross-sectional imaging further extends the role of imaging modalities to the evaluation of benign esophageal lesions. Through an awareness of the multiplanar cross-sectional appearances of various benign esophageal lesions, the radiologist can {{play an important role in}} the detection, diagnosis, further diagnostic planning, and treatment of the diseases in which they occur.

50|$|Spontaneous {{perforation}} of {{the esophagus}} most commonly {{results from a}} full-thickness tear in the esophageal wall due to a sudden increase in intraesophageal pressure combined with relatively negative intrathoracic pressure caused by straining or vomiting (effort rupture of the esophagus or Boerhaave's syndrome). Other causes of spontaneous perforation include <b>caustic</b> ingestion, pill <b>esophagitis,</b> Barrett's esophagus, infectious ulcers in patients with AIDS, and following dilation of esophageal strictures.|$|R

From 1981 to 2000 were admitted and treated in the Gastrocentro State University of Campinas, SP, Brazil, 120 patients presenting caustic stenosis of the esophagus, and during the follow-up were found nine cases with Barrett's esophagus associated (7, 5 %).

40|$|From 1984 to 1989, 175 {{esophageal cancer}} {{patients}}, 10 patients admitted for severe <b>caustic</b> <b>esophagitis,</b> and 1 patient with pyothorax due to iatrogenic perforation of the esophagus underwent an esophageal resection or bypass operation. One hundred sixty-eight esophageal resections {{were performed on}} 167 patients; 13 were total, 106 subtotal and 49 distal. Nineteen digestive transplants were {{pulled up to the}} neck to bypass the esophagus or re-establish continuity after an esophagectomy made elsewhere. Digestive continuity was restored by a long gastric transplant in 120 patients, a colon segment in 17, a jejunal loop in 35, and a short gastric transplant after limited esophago-gastrectomy in 14 patients. Thirty day mortality was 0 in the whole group. Hospital mortality was 1. 2 % in the resection group and 10. 5 % in the bypass group (p = 0. 048). Nonfatal postoperative complications consisted of respiratory distress in 33 patients, recurrent nerve palsy in 10, anastomotic fistula in 10 (cervical in 8 and intrathoracic in 2) and anastomotic stenosis in 18 patients. Respiratory complications were more frequent in patients with a cancer of the thoracic esophagus (29 / 111) than in those operated on for a cancer located in the esophago-gastric junction (4 / 50) (p < 0. 01). Anastomotic stenosis occurred more frequently in the neck (17 / 137) than in the chest (1 / 49) (p < 0. 05). Nine patients were reoperated on for a technical complication; intraabdominal hemorrhage (1), thoracic duct injury (2), acute cholecystitis (1), tight stricture of the esophageal anastomosis (2), jejuno-duodenal anastomotic fistual (2), or stridor related to recurrent nerve palsy (1). Low postoperative mortality may be achieved after esophageal surgery, even in a nonselected Caucasian population. However, nonfatal complications indicate that an esophageal resection or bypass operation remains a major surgical procedure. The surgical principles which we have applied to minimize postoperative mortality and severe complications are presented...|$|E
40|$|RACIONAL: A estenose esofágica secundária à ingestão de produtos cáusticos é freqüente no Brasil, principalmente como tentativa de suicídio. O esôfago de Barrett surge como conseqüência do refluxo gastroesofágico crônico. A {{literatura}} pesquisada mostrou que esta associação é muito rara. CASUÍSTICA E MÉTODOS: De 1981 a 2000 foram admitidos e tratados no Gastrocentro-UNICAMP (Universidade Estadual de Campinas, SP.) 120 doentes com estenose cáustica do esôfago e durante o seguimento destes, foram encontrados 9 casos associados com o esôfago de Barrett (7, 5 %). O tempo de ingestão do cáustico variou de 4 a 54 anos (média de 29 anos) e eram quatro homens e cinco mulheres, oito brancos e um negro, com idade média de 57, 7 anos (43 a 72 anos). RESULTADOS: Todos os casos apresentavam disfagia e a endoscopia digestiva alta flexível mostrou áreas de estenose e seqüelas de esofagite cáustica. Três pacientes referiram sintomas de refluxo gastroesofágico, mas hérnia de hiato foi encontrada em apenas um caso. O esôfago de Barrett foi encontrado no terço médio do esôfago em três casos, acima das áreas de estenose, e nos demais, no terço distal. A disfagia foi tratada com dilatações esofágicas periódicas. Dois pacientes apresentando sintomas de refluxo grave foram submetidos a fundoplicatura à Nissen modificado através de videolaparoscopia, com bons resultados. CONCLUSÕES: O esôfago de Barrett nesses doentes poderia estar associado com a ingestão de cáustico, porque nem sempre esteve associado à esofagite por refluxo. É muito importante o seguimento desses doentes e realização periódica de endoscopias digestivas com biopsias do esôfago de Barrett, devido à possibilidade de malignização.
