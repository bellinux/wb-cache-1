Computer-based control systems are widely used in vehicle applications (e. g., aircraft, marine and automobile). The earlier forms of control systems were typified by a central computer connected to sub-systems using hard-wired point-to-point communication links.

50|$|In the atmosphere, {{the risk}} factors of wind and {{lightning}} come into play. The basic mitigation is location. As long as the tether's anchor remains within two degrees of the equator, it {{will remain in the}} quiet zone between the Earth's Hadley cells, where there is relatively little violent weather. Remaining storms could be avoided by moving a floating anchor platform. The lightning risk can be minimized by using a nonconductive fiber with a water-resistant coating to help prevent a conductive buildup from forming. The wind risk can be minimized by use of a fiber with a small cross-sectional area that can rotate with the wind to reduce resistance. Ice forming on the cable also presents a potential problem. It could add significantly to the <b>cable's</b> <b>weight</b> and affect the passage of elevator cars. Also, ice falling from the cable could damage elevator cars or the cable itself.

40|$|Increased {{electrical}} power demands are being experienced {{on the new}} generation of aircraft due to an increased reliance on electrical technology of systems such as air conditioning, de-icing systems and electrical flight control actuation. Distribution of power at higher AC and DC voltages is therefore now being seen in modern aircraft to avoid the penalties incurred due to high cable weights. Voltages have increased past the minimum of Paschen's law resulting in a risk that life limiting partial discharge (PD) damage can occur in the insulation systems. This thesis uses a theoretical analysis backed by PD experimental results to investigate the optimal operating voltage of a cabling system. In addition, it proposes a methodology for optimizing the operating voltage level based on an analysis of the power carrying capability of cabling within a fixed and a non-fixed volume system and the derivation of the <b>cable</b> <b>weight</b> as a function of voltage. Furthermore the power carrying capability of a certain round cable system is compared with an insulated flat conductor system as in a printed circuit board (PCB). An initial assessment has been carried out to determine whether more power can be delivered via insulated flat solid conductors as in a PCB, instead of using round cables. The reason why {{there is a need to}} investigate this aspect, is because using new PCB technology can offer several advantages over traditional cabling harnesses. The work done has shown that the optimal operating point (e. g. maximum power to weight ratio) for an aircraft power system, does not improve after certain voltage levels. A tradeoff between <b>cable</b> <b>weight</b> and power transfer is required and furthermore the use of DC systems can result in higher power transfers than conventional three phase/ 400 Hz AC systems. The PCB maximum power transfer assessment has also shown that insulated flat conductor systems can offer higher power transfer efficiencies. In addition, experimental AC and DC PD tests on certain unscreened aerospace cables (laid out in different configurations), have shown that the theoretical analysis employed to determine cable safe operating voltages gives conservative results.

In Wireless Avionics Intra-Communication (WAIC) medium, the potential sources of interference are existing wireless communication systems and malicious transmission sources. Migrating from wired to wireless systems, with the motive to reduce the <b>cable</b> <b>weight</b> inside an aircraft, raises several issues in terms of safety and reliability. One of the major threats it poses, is the risk of jamming attacks by interfering radio waves. Existing wireless systems are well coordinated by regulatory bodies to avoid unintentional interference. However malicious transmission, such as jamming attacks are unpredictable in nature and can disrupt the communication for an unknown time interval, leading to catastrophic failure conditions for safety critical systems. In this thesis, as one of the countermeasures against malicious transmission, spectrum sensing techniques are analyzed.

40|$|Abstract—Conventional {{electrical}} distribution systems onboard aircraft use a {{three-phase system}} with a typical voltage of 115 VAC or 230 VAC to supply electrical loads. Future aircraft demand more electric power due to the replacement of hydraulic and pneumatic systems by electrical ones and {{the increased use of}} multimedia entertainment systems. However, the aircraft weight can be decreased if a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) grid with a voltage level of ± 270 VDC or 540 VDC is implemented to supply the electrical loads. These higher voltages reduce <b>cable</b> <b>weight,</b> but are a new challenge for solid-state power controllers (SSPC), which are used as protection devices for cables and loads.

This trend will only continue {{with the introduction of}} novel technologies such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). To save <b>cable</b> <b>weight</b> and costs in-vehicle control systems often use shared communication networks. With the increasing use of in-vehicle control systems the scheduling of these networks becomes a serious challenge. In this master thesis a new event-triggered approach for the scheduling of networked control systems (NCSs) using timed game automata (TGA) is considered. This new approach yields some potential benefits over existing communication protocols and has already been implemented successfully on two-dimensional linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. To obtain the control system TGA for this scheduling approach the NCSs have to be abstracted. The control system abstraction method that is used has to be modified {{in order to be able}} to handle higher dimensional systems as well, and that is exactly the focus of this master thesis. The abstraction method is extended and applied to three-dimensional and four-dimensional in-vehicle LTI control systems.

Using nonlinear static and dynamic analysis methods and adopting 3 D finite element model, the responses of an actual self-anchored {{suspension bridge}} to sudden breakage of hangers are studied in this paper. The results show that the sudden breakage of a hanger causes violent vibration and large changes in internal forces of the bridge.

This electrical cable can weigh up to 10 kg per metre and is often lifted in restricted spaces in underground coal mines. Seven male subjects performed eight cable lifting and hanging tasks, while trunk kinematic data and trunk muscle electromyograms (EMGs) were obtained. The eight tasks were combinations of four postures (standing, stooping kneeling on one knee, or kneeling on both knees) and two levels of cable load (0 N or 100 N load added to the existing <b>cable</b> <b>weight).</b> An EMG-assisted model was used to calculate forces and moments acting on the lumbar spine. A two-way split-plot ANOVA showed that increased load (p< 0. 05) and changes in lifting posture (p< 0. 05) independently affected trunk muscle recruitment and spinal loading. The increase in cable load resulted in higher EMG activity of all trunk muscles and increased axial and lateral bending moments on the spine (p < 0. 05). Changes in posture caused more selective adjustments in muscle recruitment and affected the sagittal plane moment (p < 0. 05). Despite the more selective nature of trunk EMG changes due to posture, the magnitude of changes in spinal loading was often quite dramatic.

In doing all these activities, well intervention companies are highly dependent on the performance and reliability of wireline cables. However, senior technical people at Altus Intervention (formerly called Aker Well Service) have identified {{the presence of a}} miss-match between the performance of the currently available wireline cables (specially the 5 / 16 ″ - monoconductor cable) and the demand of a well intervention task as wells goes deeper, deviated, and acidic. For these reasons, the company has initiated this project work so as to look for the improvement potential of the currently used monoconductor cables. In order to pinpoint the limitations of the currently used cables, I have conducted a thorough discussion with senior technical people at Altus Intervention, extracted relevant information and data from the company’s Synergy page, participated in different wireline training courses, and also conduct relevant literature review. Overall, the inherent limitations of the currently used 5 / 16 ″ cables are found to originate from their limited strength, relatively heavy weight, integrity of the insulation material, and poor H 2 S resistance of the steel (high strength version) armor. Moreover, operational related problems such as gas breakthrough, development of kinks and bird nesting, and also the cost of corrosion resistance grades of the cable are found to be leading problems. Thus, formulating a new design approach so as to address these limitations either fully or partially was the main theme of this project work. In an attempt to solve these limitations, I have used a new design approach which effectively combines high strength Kevlar® 49 fiber with abrasion resistance and electrical conducting steel armor wire. The new approach is found to have a higher prospect towards reducing the <b>cable</b> <b>weight,</b> improving the breaking strength, fatigue life, and alleviating short circuiting and other common problems of the currently used 5 / 16 "- monoconductor cables. Furthermore, the conformance of the new concept cable to the harsh well environment, working condition, and operational demand of the well intervention task is also investigated using scientific data, mathematical modeling, software simulation, and other techniques. Though all the results found are highly encouraging, I strongly recommend the development of a prototype cable and undertake all the relevant tests so as to review the conformance of the new cable to the actual working condition. Developing a tailored inspection technique for this concept cable and also extending the concept towards other cable grades are identified as continuation works of this project work. Furthermore, the possibility of finding non-steel based but abrasion resistance materials so as to fully replace the entire armor wire is also sighted as possible and fascinating research topic as this further helps to reduce the <b>cable</b> <b>weight...</b>|$|E
