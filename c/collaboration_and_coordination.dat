50|$|Cooperation is {{the action}} of working {{together}} to the same end. Cooperation developed naturally over time, as it helped companies to streamline their research costs and to better answer to users' requirements. As a result, nowadays organisations are looking for flexible structures that can easily adapt to this rapidly changing environment. Groupware systems perfectly cater to these needs of companies. Informal communication predominates and specialists in certain domains exchange their experience with other people within the groupware environment. Collaboration and cooperation are available through instant messages; people can discuss, chat and swap ideas. Moreover, people can work together while they are located remotely from each other. Groupware can be split into three categories: communication, <b>collaboration</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordination,</b> depending {{on the level of}} cooperation and technology involved in the process. One of the biggest and well-known cooperation software is Wikipedia.|$|E
50|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{units of}} all the three crocodilian species have been established at Nandankanan Zoo. In 1980, the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) was bred in captivity {{for the first time}} at the Nandankanan Biological Park in Odisha. This successful effort involved the <b>collaboration</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> between international and national zoological parks. The male came from the Frankfurt zoo and the females were from the Nandankanan and Trivandrum zoos. A large part of the credit for this first time ex-situ breeding in captivity goes to the meticulous planning and designing of the breeding enclosure at the Nandankanan Zoo by Dr. H. R. Bustard, which simulates the gharial's natural habitat of a deep flowing river with adequate high-rise sandbanks. The breeding enclosure, together with a judicious mix of adult size classes to from a social group, minimal disturbance and provision of natural food culminated in that success story, which continues to the present date. The Nandankanan Biological park has since provided many zoos around the world with captive-bred gharials for display and education. Muggers bred at Nandankanan Zoo have also been released in Satkosia Gorge.|$|E

In {{the last couple of}} years, voice and video started utilizing the Internet convention and have incredibly extended the conceivable outcomes for synchronous communications-driven DSS. A document driven DSS utilizes PC storage and processing technologies to give record recovery and investigation. Huge archived databases may incorporate examined reports, hypertext records, pictures, sounds and video. Content and record administration expanded in the 1970s and 1980s as a critical, generally utilized automated means for presenting and preparing bits of content. Cases of archives that may be retrieved by a document driven DSS are strategies and techniques, item determinations, catalogs and corporate verifiable reports, including minutes of meetings and correspondence. A search engine is an essential decision-aiding tool connected with document-driven DSS. Knowledge-driven DSS can propose or prescribe actions to managers. These DSS are individual PC frameworks with specific critical thinking ability risen. The [...] "expertise" [...] comprises knowledge around a specific area, comprehension of issues inside that space, and [...] "skill" [...] at taking care of some of these issues. These frameworks have been called suggestion DSS and knowledge-based DSS.|$|E

However, since the value model is not implemented, the necessary information for monitoring the value viewpoint needs to be derived from the coordination viewpoint.

In this paper we define the relation between both viewpoints for the complete collaboration life cycle. Furthermore, we provide a mechanism to monitor the collaboration from a value viewpoint.
