Further, according to this analysis and GAO's case study review, liabilities will likely exist for renewable energy and privatized utility projects in the event of base closure because these projects commit the government to making future payments, although the liabilities may be limited by termination for convenience clauses in agreements. In contrast, privatized housing, privatized army lodging, and enhanced use lease projects are generally not expected to create a financial liability if bases close because DOD does not expect to terminate these types of agreements. ...|$|R

We show that order up-to policies continue to be optimal for models with information flow for the finite horizon, the infinite horizon discounted and the infinite horizon average cost cases.

40|$|Today, {{people are}} {{increasingly}} connected and extensively {{interact with each}} other using technology-enabled media. Hence, <b>customer</b> <b>s</b> are more frequently exposed to social influence of other customers when making purchase decisions. However, established approaches for customer valuat ion most widely neglect network effects based on social influence leading to a misallocation of resour ces. Therefore, following a design-oriented approach, this paper develops a model fo r customer valuation referred to as the customer lifetime network value (CLNV) incorporating an integrated network perspective. By considering the net networ k contribution of customers, the CLNV reallocates values between customers based on social influence without changing the overall network value, that is, a firm’s cust omer equity. Using a real-world dataset of a European online social network, we demonstrate and evaluate the applicability of the CLNV. We show that the CLNV enables a sound determination of both individual customers’ value and firm’s customer eq uity and supports thorough customer segmentation...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The U. S. military has long relied on contractors to provide a variety {{of goods and services}} to U. S. forces around the world, including those located in Iraq and Afghanistan. These services range from maintaining advanced weapon systems and setting up and operating communications networks to providing gate and perimeter security, interpreting foreign languages, preparing meals and doing laundry for the troops. The U. S. Department of Defense (DOD) uses contractors for a variety of reasons, including a lack of skilled and qualified military personnel and the need to conserve scarce skills to ensure that they will be available for future deployments. DOD estimates that it has more than 50, 000 contractor employees in support of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Depending on the types of services being offered, contractor employees may be U. S. citizens, or third country nationals, and contractors are often encouraged to hire host country nationals to help rebuild local economies and get local nationals back to work. While contractor employees can provide significant benefits to U. S. forces, contractor employees can also pose a risk to U. S. troops. For example, the terrorists who attacked the U. S. S. Cole were suspected to be contractor employees associated with its refueling operations. This attack led military officials to realize the risk that contractors could pose to the safety and security of U. <b>S.</b> <b>installations</b> and military personnel. The risk is increased when U. S. forces are involved in a military operation against an insurgency, as they are in Iraq. Background screenings of contractor employees can provide some insight into the likelihood that the employee may cause harm to U. S. troops and may deter some criminals and terrorists from working at U. <b>S.</b> <b>installations.</b> Although DOD is not required to screen contractor employees, in some situations, such as in Iraq, DOD is using biometrics to screen contractor employees for past criminal activity and security threats. GAO was asked to review the process used to screen contractor employees who support U. S. deployed forces. Specifically, we were asked to determine the ability of DOD and contractors that support deployed forces to conduct comprehensive background screenings of employees and the steps installation commanders have taken to protect their troops. ...|$|R
