25|$|The {{force of}} {{friction}} is always exerted {{in a direction}} that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a <b>curling</b> <b>stone</b> sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note {{that it is not the}} direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.|$|E
500|$|A promotional music video, {{directed}} by Super Furry Animals and Martin McCarthy, was produced {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Northern Lites" [...] as a single. The video begins with a shot of Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo, which appears {{on the cover of}} [...] "Northern Lites", displayed above the words [...] "Public information service". This shot fades to show a full-screen translucent, fluorescent blue, image of the [...] "warrior", also from the single's cover, which moves from the centre to the bottom right before shrinking and remaining stationary in the top right {{for the duration of the}} video. The SFA logo from the introduction is shown in the top left, opposite the [...] "warrior" [...] image, and also remains throughout the video. The island Ailsa Craig is briefly shown, the island where in 2004 when the single was released, 60 to 70% of all curling stones in use were made from granite from the island and is one of only two sources for all stones in the sport, the other being the Trefor Granite Quarry in Wales. Next, images of the sea and birds in flight are shown before footage of a bearded man, sitting on rocks beside the sea and singing along to the first verse is shown. This footage is intercut with shots of a man using a hammer and chisel on some boulders before walking away with a large rock. The rock is shown being spun and polished into a <b>curling</b> <b>stone.</b> A yellow handle is added to the stone and it is placed into a wooden box alongside another stone with a red handle. The box is closed and the word Nagano is seen printed on the lid. The video then cuts to shots of a Boeing 747 before wintery scenes of Nagano are shown, including a shot of people with umbrellas stood in the snow in front of a sign that reads [...] "Nagano Olympics". Footage from curling events are then shown until 2 minutes and 40 seconds when the video cuts to show a man in a grey suit dropping a handful of grass on a road. The video then ends with shots of Irish road bowling–several men are shown throwing a bowl down a road surrounded by spectators alongside scenes of men with measuring sticks and men exchanging banknotes. In a 2008 interview with Uncut, Gruff Rhys stated that [...] "Northern Lites" [...] "didn't have a video" [...] and suggested this as the reason the track was not a [...] bigger hit than it was. The director who was originally scheduled to work on the video took up an offer of a Red Stripe commercial in Jamaica, leaving the band to collaborate with McCarthy. According to Rhys the group met the original director later and told him [...] "We understand, we'd have done the same." [...] Despite this, bassist Guto Pryce has described the [...] "Northern Lites" [...] music video as one of only a handful of the group's videos that he actually likes.|$|E
2500|$|Following Carol's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Majority Rules" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, the HouseGuests were asked a series of {{questions}} about which of two HouseGuests would adhere to certain situations. The object was not to base the answer on personal opinions, but how they thought the majority would answer. The minority of the voters were eliminated each round; if there was a tie, none of the HouseGuests would be eliminated. Jen was the winner of the competition. On Day 14, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Name That Pie" [...] food competition. For this competition, HouseGuests split into two teams and would bid on how many bites it would take to identify the two ingredients in a pie. If a player correctly identified the pie, they win a point for the team, but if they were unable to identify the pie, they would win a point for the opposing team; the first team to seven points would be the winner. The competition resulted in Amber, Daniele, Jameka, Jessica, Joe, and Kail being on slop for the week. That same day, Jen chose to nominate Daniele and Dick for eviction, claiming {{that the two of them}} were the most negative people in the house. On Day 15, Amber, Mike, and Joe were selected to play for the Power of Veto competition; Dustin was selected to host. Shortly before the competition, Jen made numerous statements to upset Amber, which led to numerous arguments in the house. The HouseGuests then competed in the [...] "Cutthroat Christmas" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were required to slide a <b>curling</b> <b>stone</b> down an icy path in an attempt to get it closest to the center; the person furthest from the center each round is eliminated. The eliminated HouseGuest from each round earns a prize, which can be taken from them at any time by another eliminated HouseGuest. Daniele was the winner of the Power of Veto for the second consecutive time. On Day 17, Daniele chose to use the Power of Veto to remove herself from the block, with Jen nominating Joe in her place. Fearing he would nominate her if he won Head of Household, Kail began attempting to get the votes to evict Dick from the house. Despite this, not even Kail's own alliance went along with her plan, thus ending the [...] "Mrs. Robinson" [...] alliance. On Day 20, Joe became the second HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of nine to one.|$|E

Because of the rarity of this granite, the best stones can cost as much as US$1,500. Between 60 and 70 percent of the stones used today are made from Ailsa Craig granite, although the island is now a wildlife reserve and is still used for quarrying under license for Ailsa granite by Kays of Mauchline for <b>curling</b> <b>stones.</b>|$|R

50|$|Ailsa Craig is the {{traditional}} source and produces two types of granite, Blue Hone and Ailsa Craig Common Green.

50|$|Trepanning is {{commonly}} used for creating larger diameter holes (up to 915 mm) where a standard drill bit is not feasible or economical. Trepanning removes the desired diameter by cutting out a solid disk similar to the workings of a drafting compass. Trepanning is performed on flat products such as sheet metal, granite (<b>curling</b> <b>stone),</b> plates, or structural members like I-beams. Trepanning can also be useful to make grooves for inserting seals, such as O-rings.|$|E
