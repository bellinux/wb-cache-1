Joseph Franklin purchased land in the Brindabellas in 1849 and attempted {{to set up a}} <b>cattle</b> <b>farm.</b> His livestock were slaughtered by the local Aboriginal people and he was driven back out of the mountains.

Funthermore existing dairy <b>cattle</b> <b>farms</b> in the district should be replaced by dairy types that are resistence to warm environment. Sufficient feed availability and relatively high price of milk should be an optimum condition to enchance dairy cattle development in the said region.
