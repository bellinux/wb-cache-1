25|$|The Third Edition of {{the game}} was {{published}} as a single hardback book in 1987. It had the most in-depth and <b>complex</b> <b>movement</b> and manoeuvre system of any edition. Other changes included {{a variety of new}} specialist troop types, rules for war machines and a more finely tuned system of representing heroes and wizards. It kept the same magic system and open-ended army design system as the first two editions. However, by this stage the use of army lists was very much encouraged. Army lists for this edition were published in a separate book called Warhammer Armies in 1988; until then, use of the 2nd Edition's Ravening Hordes list was encouraged. This is partly because it was the last edition published before Games Workshop took a different commercial approach, leading to competition from former GW employees in the briefly published competing Fantasy Warlord.|$|E
500|$|Bach set {{the opening}} Old Testament passage {{as a large}} scale <b>complex</b> <b>movement</b> for four-part chorus and full {{orchestra}} in three sections, one for each sentence in the biblical quotation. By contrast he set the New Testament passage beginning the second part as a bass solo accompanied by a single obbligato violoncello, the bass voice representing the traditional voice of Jesus. The cantata is scored for three groups of instruments—alto recorders, oboes and strings—from which the four obbligato soloists are drawn that accompany the two arias, for alto and soprano.|$|E

40|$|In this chapter, {{we use the}} sit-up to {{illustrate}} the complexity of coordination in movements that involve many muscles, joints, degrees of freedom, {{and high levels of}} muscle activity. <b>Complex</b> <b>movements</b> often involve the body axis. In addition to the intentional, focal part of any voluntary <b>movement,</b> <b>complex</b> <b>movements</b> also include "associated movements" that are not consciously controlled, but are necessary for the movement to succeed. Some associated movements serve a purpose, and others may not. During sitting up, the leg-lift is a purposive associated movement, whereas three-joint flexion is a non-purposive associated movement. The control of <b>complex</b> <b>movements</b> is also likely to be complex and, we argue, is hierarchically controlled. Associated movements may, themselves, be hierarchically organized and triggered by lower brain structures, local changes in neuronal excitability, and sensory feedback. <b>Complex</b> <b>movements</b> typically involve a high level of mobility. Because this mobility can lead to instability, anticipatory postural adjustments, a type of purposive associated movement, are commonly used to regulate posture. Thus, a number of important aspects of motor coordination can only be revealed by the study of <b>complex</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Landslides {{in which}} the sliding surface is mostly deeply located below the maximum rooting depth of trees (typically to depths greater than ten meters). Deep-seated {{landslides}} usually involve deep regolith, weathered rock, and/or bedrock and include large slope failure associated with translational, rotational, or <b>complex</b> <b>movement.</b> This type of landslide potentially occurs in an tectonic active region like Zagros Mountain in Iran. [...] These typically move slowly, only several meters per year, but occasionally move faster. They tend to be larger than shallow landslides and form along a plane of weakness such as a fault or bedding plane. They can be visually identified by concave scarps {{at the top and}} steep areas at the toe.|$|E
2500|$|Prime {{responsibility}} for the celebrated spinwheel, which is largely individual and instinctive, rests with the Garrison Sergeant Major. [...] A 'wheel' {{is not an easy}} manoeuvre with even a small body of troops, and with a block of 400 men the normal wheel is impossible. The massed band therefore pivots on its own centre, so that certain outer ranks and files march long distances in a hurry while the centre and inner ranks loiter with extreme intent, or merely mark time. Yet others not only step sideways but backwards as well. This highly <b>complex</b> <b>movement</b> is called a 'spin-wheel', the details of which can be found in no drill book or manual of ceremonial. Its complexity defies description, and if the truth were known, many of the participants know not whither they go or, on arrival, how they got there. The spin-wheel is almost an art form and each performance of it, although similar in essentials, is different in detail. Most of the performers are adjusting their actions to suit the needs of the spin-wheel of the moment, having adjusted their movements quite otherwise on other occasions.|$|E
6000|$|Having {{referred}} to the act of sucking, I may add that this <b>complex</b> <b>movement,</b> {{as well as the}} alternate protrusion of the fore-feet, are reflex actions; for they are performed if a finger moistened with milk is placed in the mouth of a puppy, the front part of whose brain has been removed.[17] It has recently been stated in France, that the action of sucking is excited solely through the sense of smell, so that if the olfactory nerves of a puppy are destroyed, it never sucks. In like manner the wonderful power which a chicken possesses only a few hours after being hatched, of picking up small particles of food, seems to be started into action through the sense of hearing; for with chickens hatched by artificial heat, a good observer found that [...] "making a noise with the finger-nail against a board, in imitation of the hen-mother, first taught them to peck at their meat."[18] ...|$|E

60|$|On {{the cause}} of the {{obliquity}} of the eyebrows under suffering.-- During several years no expression seemed to me so utterly perplexing as this which we are here considering. Why should grief or anxiety cause the central fasciae alone of the frontal muscle together with those round the eyes, to contract? Here we seem to have a <b>complex</b> <b>movement</b> {{for the sole purpose of}} expressing grief; and yet it is a comparatively rare expression, and often overlooked. I believe the explanation is not so difficult as it at first appears. Dr. Duchenne gives a photograph of the young man before referred to, who, when looking upwards at a strongly illuminated surface, involuntarily contracted his grief-muscles in an exaggerated manner. I had entirely forgotten this photograph, when on a very bright day with the sun behind me, I met, whilst on horseback, a girl whose eyebrows, as she looked up at me, became extremely oblique, with the proper furrows on her forehead. I have observed the same movement under similar circumstances on several subsequent occasions. On my return home I made three of my children, without giving them any clue to my object, look as long and as attentively as they could, at the summit of a tall tree standing against an extremely bright sky. With all three, the orbicular, corrugator, and pyramidal muscles were energetically contracted, through reflex action, from the excitement of the retina, so that their eyes might be protected from the bright light. But they tried their utmost to look upwards; and now a curious struggle, with spasmodic twitchings, could be observed between the whole or only the central portion of the frontal muscle, and the several muscles which serve to lower the eyebrows and close the eyelids. The involuntary contraction of the pyramidal caused the basal part of their noses to be transversely and deeply wrinkled. In one of the three children, the whole eyebrows were momentarily raised and lowered by the alternate contraction of the whole frontal muscle and of the muscles surrounding the eyes, so that the whole breadth of the forehead was alternately wrinkled and smoothed. In the other two children the forehead became wrinkled in the middle part alone, rectangular furrows being thus produced; and the eyebrows were rendered oblique, with their inner extremities puckered and swollen,-- in the one child in a slight degree, in the other in a strongly marked manner. This difference in the obliquity of the eyebrows apparently depended on a difference in their general mobility, and in the strength of the pyramidal muscles. In both these cases the eyebrows and forehead were acted on under the influence of a strong light, in precisely the same manner, in every characteristic detail, as under the influence of grief or anxiety.|$|E

40|$|SummaryCortical motor {{maps are}} the basis of {{voluntary}} movement, but they have proven difficult to understand {{in the context of}} their underlying neuronal circuits. We applied light-based motor mapping of Channelrhodopsin- 2 mice to reveal a functional subdivision of the forelimb motor cortex based on the direction of movement evoked by brief (10  ms) pulses. Prolonged trains of electrical or optogenetic stimulation (100 – 500  ms) targeted to anterior or posterior subregions of motor cortex evoked reproducible <b>complex</b> <b>movements</b> of the forelimb to distinct positions in space. Blocking excitatory cortical synaptic transmission did not abolish basic motor map topography, but the site-specific expression of <b>complex</b> <b>movements</b> was lost. Our data suggest that the topography of movement maps arises from their segregated output projections, whereas <b>complex</b> <b>movements</b> evoked by prolonged stimulation require intracortical synaptic transmission...|$|R

40|$|The Problem: Development of {{theoretical}} methods for {{the representation of}} <b>complex</b> <b>movements</b> based on learned prototypical examples for technical applications, and as basis to understand action recognition in biological systems. Motivation: Learning-based methods have been successfully applied for {{the representation of the}} shape of complex stationary objects. In computer vision and computer graphics representations which are based on learned prototypical example images have been used for the recognition and synthesis of views of 3 D objects. The idea of a view-based representation has also provided a valid interpretation of a variety of psychophysical and neurophysiological results on object recognition in humans and monkeys. Aim of this work is to develop a learning-based approach for the representation of <b>complex</b> <b>movements.</b> The central idea is that classes of <b>complex</b> <b>movements</b> can be represented using {{only a small number of}} learned prototypical example movements when representations with suitable generalization properties are defined. Based on this idea, we develop new technical methods for the recognition and synthesis of <b>complex</b> visual <b>movement</b> patterns and neural models for the recognition of biological motion in the brain. Previous Work: Many existing techniques for the recognition of motion patterns computer vision are either modelbased [7], or extract simple spatio-temporal features [6]. Learning-based methods have been proposed for tracking of movements (e. g. [3]). Learning methods have also been applied for the generation of stationary images in compute...|$|R
