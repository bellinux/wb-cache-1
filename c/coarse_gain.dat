The availability of parallel processing machine allows the programme for such analysis to be parallelized. The real time taken for computing can thus be very much reduced. This paper presents the experience gained in parallelizing the programme for the IBM 9076 Scalable Powerparallel (SP 2) System. Two <b>coarse</b> <b>gain</b> and one fine grain parallelisms based on various strategies are discussed.

Quartz, plagioclase feldspars, K-feldspars {{are the most important}} non-clay minerals. Amphiboles occur throughout the core in minor amounts. The composition of the sediments points to an origin in the Transantarctic Mountains {{for the majority of the}} detrital components. There, the plutonic and metamorphic rocks of the basement, the sediments of the Beacon Supergroup and the volcanic rocks of the Ferrar Dolerite could serve as possible source lithologies. The quartz abundance is strongly linked to the gain size of the sediments with maxima correlating with <b>coarse</b> <b>gain</b> sizes. The downcore distribution of the other detrital minerals is relatively invariable, and does not indicate a major change in the source area during the time represented by the CRP- 1 sediments. Some diagenetic alteration of the sediments is indicated by the occurrence of minor amounts of opal-CT and by some clinoptilolite below 110 m depth...|$|E

40|$|Parallel {{algorithms}} for the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) {{and closely}} related <b>Coarse</b> <b>Gained</b> Multicomputer (CGM) programming model {{assume that all}} data can be distributed over the main memories of the processors involved. In practice, {{this may not be}} the case. For large scale applications where parallel processing is helpful, the total amount of data often exceeds the total main memory available and parallel disk I/O becomes a necessity. A common scenario for distributed memory parallel machines assumes that each processor has multiple local hard disks available, where each disk is only accessible by the respective local processor. Parallel disk I/O has been identified as a critical component of a suitable high performance computer for a number of the Grand Challenge problems see for instance the Scalable I/O Initiative project [5] Ḟor sequential computing, the virtual memory concept has long been established as a standard method for managing external memory.

30|$|Participants in {{both studies}} first watched three movies without any {{explicit}} task {{other than to}} pay close attention to the movies. After watching all three movies, participants watched the three movies two more times. During these latter two viewings, they were asked to press a button whenever they believed that one meaningful unit of activity had ended and another had begun. On one viewing, they were asked to identify the smallest units that were natural and meaningful to them (fine grain segmentation); during the other repetition, they were instructed to identify the largest units that were natural and meaningful (<b>coarse</b> <b>gain</b> segmentation). For example, a typical participant might have identified a coarse unit that could be described as “making toast”, and fine units within that coarse unit that could be described as “opening a bag of bread”, “putting bread in the toaster”, and “turning on the toaster”. (Participants were not given any such descriptions or specific instructions as to what should constitute a fine or coarse unit, beyond those given above.) The order of fine and coarse segmentation was counterbalanced across participants. In addition, participants were not told anything about the event segmentation task until after they had finished watching all three movies passively {{in order to ensure that}} participants would not covertly button press in the passive condition. Participants’ consistency in identifying event boundaries was similar to that seen in other studies of event segmentation (see Additional file  1 for a description of this analysis and the results).|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{behavior}} of partially saturated coarse-grained soil packings was studied {{as a function of}} solid surface composition and aqueous salt concentration. The substrates tested were PTFE and soda lime glass, while the aqueous electrolytes consisted of NaCl and CaCl 2 in differing concentrations. In order to gain a fundamental understanding of the unsaturated soils system, the two phase intersections of gas-liquid and solid-liquid were studied. The effect of varying aqueous electrolytes on the gas-liquid interface was analyzed by testing the surface tension while systematically varying the electrolyte concentration, while the effect on the solid/liquid/gas interface was studied by altering the surface hydrophobicity and aqueous solution concentration. In order to extend the analysis to soil fabrics, four ideal <b>coarse</b> <b>gained</b> packings were subdivided into their smallest repeating units. These repeating units, along with the measured dependence of the contact angles and surface tension on salt types, allowed an estimation of the equilibrium behavior of the capillary rise and tensile strength within a uniform coarse-grained fabric.

40|$|Optical Burst Switching (OBS) {{has proved}} to be an {{efficient}} paradigm for supporting IP-over-WDM networks. The growth of a variety of applications which transmit voice, data, video and multimedia, has necessitated the need to provide Quality of Service (QoS) over OBS networks. One of the key factors in OBS is the scheduling algorithm that is used in the switches to allocate the incoming bursts to a wavelength. Since the arrival of bursts is dynamic, it is highly desirable that the scheduling is done as quickly as possible. In this paper, a survey of various existing burst scheduling algorithm that provide QoS and reduce burst dropping probability is presented and compare different algorithm. other hand, no circuit setup is required in OPS but packet header need to be processed in the electronic domain on hop-by-hop basis. Due to which data payload must wait in optical buffers like fiber delay lines (FDLs), which is very complex and challenging task in high speed optical networks. To do this task, OPS require optical buffers, O/E/O converters and synchronizers.

First, subspace is used to implement <b>coarse</b> image recognition, <b>gaining</b> one or more candidate samples with different identities. Then, a special SIFT recognition environment is designed, in which the approach takes all the images as objects, builds a multi-object sample image with its size limited below a certain size, detects SIFT points based on object regions and recognizes the test image through SIFT point registration statistical vote. The experiments show that the designed SIFT recognition environment can increase SIFT recognition accuracy and the method based on subspace and SIFT can provide accurate recognitions in a mass of images.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{studies the}} {{performance}} of transmission schemes that have rate that increases with average SNR while maintaining a fixed outage probability. This {{is in contrast to}} the classical Zheng-Tse diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) that focuses on increasing rate and decreasing outage probability. Three different systems are explored: antenna diversity systems, time/frequency diversity systems, and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems. In order to accurately study performance in the fixed outage setting, it is necessary to go beyond the <b>coarse,</b> asymptotic multiplexing <b>gain</b> metric. In the case of antenna diversity and time/frequency diversity, an affine approximation to high SNR outage capacity (i. e., multiplexing gain plus a power/rate offset) accurately describes performance and illustrates the very significant benefits of diversity. ARQ is also seen to provide a significant performance advantage, but even an affine approximation to outage capacity is sometimes unable to capture this advantage and outage capacity must be directly studied in the non-asymptotic regime.

40|$|Accurate {{representation}} of periodic speech segments IS essen-tral for synthesizmg high-quality digital speech. For bit rates at and below 4 kb/s, conventional code-excited hnear predictive codmg (CELP) {{does not provide}} the appropriate degree of periodicity. Small codebook size and <b>coarse</b> quantrzation of <b>gain</b> factors result m large spectral fluctuations between pitch penods. At low bit rates, smoothness of spectral changes {{can be achieved by}} an excita-non function whtch contams one excitation pulse of fixed or slowly time-varying shape for each pitch period. Earher work has shown that single-pulse excitation can achieve reasonably good speech quality. However, this method was based on an optimization pro-cedure that caused a very large coding delay. In this paper, we present a linear predrctive coder that classifies speech into periodic and nonperiodic intervals. Nonperiodic speech is synthesized as in CELP. Periodic speech is synthesized using single-pulse excitation. The coder is based on a new algorithm for determining pitch mark-ers wrthin short blocks of periodic speech. This algorithm requires a small coding delay and is implemented efficiently by dynamic programming. ...|$|R
40|$|This Ph. D. study {{constitutes}} part of {{an extensive}} project dealing with the synthesis of biologically relevant sphingoid and ceramide analogues. In this context, we effected the synthesis of two different classes of sphingolipid analogues. In a first part, we aimed at the synthesis of hybrid PDMP analogues, based both on PDMP and styryl analogues of natural ceramide. Since preliminary synthetic approaches based on a mono-protective strategy resulted in undesired cyclisation products, a double-protective strategy was devised in which the secondary alcohol and the tert-Boc protected amine were locked in an oxazolidine ring. Hence, the desired E-styryl PDMP analogues have been synthesised in 16 steps starting from D-serine. The synthetic route was developed such that future introduction of different aryl groups is straightforward. Throughout the synthetic <b>coarse,</b> we <b>gained</b> access {{to a number of}} structural analogues, which provided more insight into the structure-activity relationship of this class of compounds. Biological evaluation, both in vitro on rat liver Golgi extracts as in vivo on HEK- 293 and COS- 7 cells revealed two lead compounds with comparable inhibitory potency as PDMP, which could be elaborated to more potent inhibitors. In a second part, we aimed at the synthesis of a new class of homoceramides, named N-homoceramides, which contain an extra methylene-spacer between the N-acyl chain and C 2 of the sphingoid backbone. To this aim, we evaluated the introduction of branching by use of a cyano group, both in a sugar approach as in regioselective epoxide opening. Since these experiments failed to provide a reliable means for introduction of branching, we opted to introduce an extra methylene spacer by use of 1, 3 -dithiane. Hence, the desired N-homo(dihydro) ceramides have been synthesized in 20 steps starting from D-ascorbic acid, a common food preservative. Key reaction in this synthetic approach was a fully regioselective epoxide opening with lithium 1, 3 -dithiane. In addition, a fully stereoselective Grignard reaction gave access to D-ribo-N-homophytoceramide...|$|R
40|$|Phase locked loop (PLL) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} devices in modern electronic systems. PLLs are widely used as clock generator or frequency synthesis in communication systems, computers, radio and other electronic applications. Phase noise represents the phase variations of a PLL output signal and is the most important characteristic of PLLs because it reflects the stability of PLL systems. Low power consumption is always desired for any electronic products today. CMOS technology is the most common process to make integrated-circuits. In this thesis, we focus on the design of low phase noise and low power CMOS PLL integrated circuits. Understanding phase noise generation mechanism in PLLs is the basis for low phase noise design. Therefore, phase noise contributed by each components in PLLs are studied at first. Voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is a critical component and the main noise contributor in a PLL. A detailed phase noise analysis for LC-tank based VCO and ring oscillator VCO, which are the most implemented VCO types, is performed. Then, the techniques for designing low phase noise and low power VCO and PLL are studied. Two PLL prototype chips are designed and fabricated in CMOS technology to demonstrate the design techniques for low phase noise and low power PLL. The first PLL is applied as clock generator in a LVDS transmitter and implemented into the AMS 0. 35 μm CMOS process technology. A novel low noise charge-pump is implemented in this PLL to achieve low phase jitter together with a VCO based on fully differential ring oscillator, a PFD based on dynamic logic circuit, and a passive loop filter. The measurement results of the PLL chip exhibit excellent phase jitter-power consumption product and wide lock range. The second PLL chip is used in an atomic clock system to provide a reference frequency of 1. 5 GHz. The test chip is implemented into the UMC 0. 18 μm process technology. A PMOS-only differential VCO based on LC-tank oscillator is implemented to achieve low phase noise. The VCO has a very low fine tuning gain to minimize phase noise and a high <b>coarse</b> tuning <b>gain</b> to compensate the frequency offset due to process variations...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} {{and severity of}} shallow landslides in New Zealand threatens life and property, both on- and off-site. The physically-based shallow landslide model LAPSUS-LS is tested for its performance in simulating shallow landslide locations induced by a high intensity rain event in a small-scale landscape. Furthermore, the effect of high resolution digital elevation models on the performance was tested. The performance of the model was optimised by calibrating different parameter values. A satisfactory result was achieved with a high resolution (1 m) DEM. Landslides, however, were generally predicted lower on the slope than mapped erosion scars. This discrepancy {{could be due to}} i) inaccuracies in the DEM or in other model input data such as soil strength properties; ii) relevant processes for this environmental context that are not included in the model; or iii) the limited validity of the infinite length assumption in the infinite slope stability model embedded in the LAPSUS-LS. The trade-off between a correct prediction of landslides versus stable cells becomes increasingly worse with coarser resolutions; and model performance decreases mainly due to altering slope characteristics. The optimal parameter combinations differ per resolution. In this environmental context the 1 m resolution topography resembles actual topography most closely and landslide locations are better distinguished from stable areas than for <b>coarser</b> resolutions. More <b>gain</b> in model performance could be achieved by adding landslide process complexities and parameter heterogeneity of the catchment...|$|R
