5|$|From January 11, 1785, to {{the fall}} of 1788, New York City was the fifth of five capitals of the United States under the Articles of Confederation, with the Continental Congress meeting at New York City Hall (then at Fraunces Tavern). New York was the first capital under the newly enacted <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> from March 4, 1789, to August 12, 1790, at Federal Hall. Federal Hall was also the site of where the United States Supreme Court {{met for the first}} time, the United States Bill of Rights were drafted and ratified, and where the Northwest Ordinance was adopted, {{establishing}} measures for adding new states to the Union.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Secession Ordinance was to “repeal the {{ratification}} of the <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> of America, by the State of Virginia.” Two days after the secession resolution and {{a month before the}} referendum, the Confederate flag was raised over Virginia's capitol building, a delegation was sent to vote in the Confederate Congress, state militias were activated and a Confederate army was invited to occupy Richmond. Though the ballots from Unionist counties were lost, the total referendum votes counted numbered more than that of the 1860 presidential election by including men voting viva voce aloud in Confederate army camps, approving secession by 128,884 to 32,134.|$|E
5|$|American {{merchant}} shipping had been {{protected by the}} British Navy, {{and as a consequence}} of the Treaty of Paris and the disarmament of the Continental Navy, the United States no longer had any protection for its ships from pirates. The fledgling nation did not have the funds to pay annual tribute to the Barbary states, so their ships were vulnerable for capture after 1785. By 1789, the new <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> authorized Congress to create a navy, but during George Washington's first term (1787–1793) little was done to rearm the navy. In 1793, the French Revolutionary Wars between Great Britain and France began, and a truce negotiated between Portugal and Algiers ended Portugal's blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar which had kept the Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean. Soon after, the pirates sailed into the Atlantic, and captured 11 American merchant ships and more than a hundred seamen.|$|E
