5|$|The {{carotenoids}} are pigmented molecules found {{naturally in}} plants, and {{some types of}} fungi, including S.scutellata. A 1965 study reported the <b>carotenoid</b> composition of this fungus, found to contain {{a high proportion of}} monocyclic carotenes—carotenes with only one cyclohexene ring, such as beta-carotene. Also present were minor amounts of xanthophyll, a molecule structurally related to the carotenes.|$|E
5|$|The {{red color}} of the fruit bodies is caused by five types of <b>carotenoid</b> pigments, {{including}} plectaniaxanthin and β-carotene. Carotenoids are lipid-soluble and are stored within granules in the paraphyses. British-Canadian mycologist Arthur Henry Reginald Buller suggested that pigments in fruit bodies exposed to the Sun absorb some of the Sun's rays, raising {{the temperature of the}} hymenium—hastening the development of the ascus and subsequent spore discharge.|$|E
5|$|Cantharellus lateritius, {{commonly}} known as the smooth chanterelle, is a species of edible fungus in the Cantharellaceae family of mushrooms. A ectomycorrhizal species, it is found in Asia, Africa, and North America. The species has a complex taxonomic history, and has undergone several name changes since its first description by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1822. The fruit bodies of the fungus are brightly colored yellow to orange, and usually highly conspicuous against the soil in which they are found. At maturity, the mushroom resembles a filled funnel with the spore-bearing surface along the sloping outer sides. The texture of the fertile undersurface (hymenium) of the caps is a distinguishing characteristic of the species: unlike the well-known golden chanterelle, the hymenium of C.lateritius is much smoother. Chemical analysis has revealed the presence of several <b>carotenoid</b> compounds in the fruit bodies.|$|E
5000|$|Of {{the three}} macular <b>carotenoids</b> (lutein, {{zeaxanthin}} and meso-zeaxanthin), meso-zeaxanthin {{is the most}} powerful antioxidant, but a combination of the macular <b>carotenoids</b> has been shown to exhibit greatest antioxidant potential, when compared to the individual <b>carotenoids</b> at the same total concentration. [...] This may explain why the human macula uniquely contains these three <b>carotenoids</b> from the circa 700 <b>carotenoids</b> present in nature.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Carotenoids</b> are {{the most}} common {{pigments}} in nature and are synthesized by all photosynthetic organisms and fungi. <b>Carotenoids</b> are considered key molecules for life. Light capture, photosynthesis photoprotection, excess light dissipation and quenching of singlet oxygen are among key biological functions of <b>carotenoids</b> relevant for life on earth. Biological properties of <b>carotenoids</b> allow {{for a wide range of}} commercial applications. Indeed, recent interest in the <b>carotenoids</b> has been mainly for their nutraceutical properties. A large number of scientific studies have confirmed the benefits of <b>carotenoids</b> to health and their use for this purpose is growing rapidly. In addition, <b>carotenoids</b> have traditionally been used in food and animal feed for their color properties. <b>Carotenoids</b> are also known to improve consumer perception of quality; an example is the addition of <b>carotenoids</b> to fish feed to impart color to farmed salmon...|$|R
40|$|Marine animals contain various <b>carotenoids</b> {{that show}} {{structural}} diversity. These marine animals accumulate <b>carotenoids</b> from {{foods such as}} algae and other animals and modify them through metabolic reactions. Many of the <b>carotenoids</b> present in marine animals are metabolites of β-carotene, fucoxanthin, peridinin, diatoxanthin, alloxanthin, and astaxanthin, etc. <b>Carotenoids</b> found in these animals provide the food chain as well as metabolic pathways. In the present review, I will describe marine animal <b>carotenoids</b> from natural product chemistry, metabolism, food chain, and chemosystematic viewpoints, and also describe new structural <b>carotenoids</b> isolated from marine animals over the last decade...|$|R
5|$|First {{described}} in 1774, the species has {{been transferred to}} various Boletaceae genera in its taxonomic history, although it retained the original name given to it by German botanist Jacob Christian Schaeffer until a transfer to genus Suillellus in 2014. Several varieties, a subspecies, and a form have been described by European mycologists. Suillellus luridus is mycorrhizal, forming a symbiotic association with deciduous trees such as oak, birch and beech, and {{has been found to}} have a growth-enhancing effect on conifers in experiments. The fruit bodies are highly attractive to, and often infested by, insects, and several species of fly have been recorded feeding on them. Chemical analyses have revealed some aspects of the mushroom's components, including its volatile flavour compounds, its fatty acid and amino acid compositions, and the identities of the <b>carotenoid</b> compounds responsible for its colour.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the spring}} molt is complete, {{the body of}} the male is a {{brilliant}} lemon yellow, a color produced by <b>carotenoid</b> pigments from plant materials in its diet, with a striking jet black cap and white rump that is visible during flight. The female is mostly brown, lighter on the underside with a yellow bib. After the autumn molt, the bright summer feathers are replaced by duller plumage, becoming buff below and olive-brown above, with a pale yellow face and bib. The autumn plumage is almost identical in both sexes, but the male has yellow shoulder patches. In some winter ranges, the goldfinches lose all traces of yellow, becoming a predominantly medium tan-gray color with an olive tinge evident only on close viewing.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is responsible}} for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the bee-eater, kingfisher and roller, for example), as well as many butterfly wings, beetle wing-cases (elytra) and (while rare among flowers) the gloss of buttercup petals. These are often iridescent, as in peacock feathers and nacreous shells such as of pearl oysters (Pteriidae) and Nautilus. This is because the reflected colour depends on the viewing angle, which in turn governs the apparent spacing of the structures responsible. Structural colours can be combined with pigment colours: peacock feathers are pigmented brown with melanin, while buttercup petals have both <b>carotenoid</b> pigments for yellowness and thin films for reflectiveness.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carotenoids</b> are organic {{pigments}} {{found in}} the chloroplasts and chromoplasts of plants. They are also found in some organisms such as algae, fungi, some bacteria, and certain species of aphids. There are over 600 known <b>carotenoids.</b> They are split into two classes, xanthophylls and carotenes. Xanthophylls are <b>carotenoids</b> with molecules containing oxygen, such as lutein and zeaxanthin. Carotenes are <b>carotenoids</b> with molecules that are unoxygenated, such as α-carotene, β-carotene and lycopene. In plants, <b>carotenoids</b> can occur in roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. <b>Carotenoids</b> have two important functions in plants. First, they can contribute to photosynthesis. They do this by transferring some of the light energy they absorb to chlorophylls, which then uses this energy for photosynthesis. Second, they can protect plants which are over-exposed to sunlight. They do this by harmlessly dissipating excess light energy which they absorb as heat. In the absence of <b>carotenoids,</b> this excess light energy could destroy proteins, membranes, and other molecules. Some plant physiologists believe that <b>carotenoids</b> may have an additional function as regulators of certain developmental responses in plants. Tetraterpenes are synthesized from DOXP precursors in plants and some bacteria. <b>Carotenoids</b> involved in photosynthesis are formed in chloroplasts; Others are formed in plastids. <b>Carotenoids</b> formed in fungi are presumably formed from mevalonic acid precursors. <b>Carotenoids</b> are formed by a head-to-head condensation of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate or diphosphate (GGPP) {{and there is no}} NADPH requirement.|$|R
25|$|Carotenes are <b>carotenoids</b> {{containing}} no oxygen. <b>Carotenoids</b> containing some oxygen {{are known}} as xanthophylls.|$|R
40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that carotenoid-based signals {{are used in}} animal communication because they contain specific information about parasite resistance or immunocompetence. This implies that honesty of carotenoid-based signals is maintained by a trade-off between pigmentation and immune function for <b>carotenoids,</b> assuming that the <b>carotenoids</b> used for coloration are also immunoenhancing. We tested this hypothesis by altering the diets of nestling great tits (Paris major) with supplementary beadlets containing the <b>carotenoids</b> that are naturally ingested with food or beadlets containing the <b>carotenoids</b> that are incorporated into the feathers; a control group received beadlets containing no <b>carotenoids.</b> We simultaneously immune challenged half of the nestlings of each supplementation group, using a two-factorial design. Activatior {{of the immune system}} led to reduced color expression. However, only nestlings fed with the naturally ingested <b>carotenoids</b> and not with the <b>carotenoids</b> deposited in the feathers showed an increased cellular immune response. This shows that the <b>carotenoids</b> used for ornamentation do not promote the immune function, which conflicts with the trade-off hypothesis. Our results indicate that honesty of carotenoid-based signals is maintained by an individual's physiological limitation to absorb and/or transport <b>carotenoids</b> and by access to <b>carotenoids,</b> indicating that preferences for carotenoid-based traits in sexual selection or parent-offspring interactions select for competitive individuals, rather than specifically for immune function...|$|R
5|$|The asci are 400–500 by 12–14µm, cylindrical, and operculate. The ascospores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical with rounded ends, uniseriate, hyaline, {{and measure}} 26–40 by 10–12µm. They contain two large oil drops at either end; the oil drops are useful taxonomic characters {{that may be}} used to help distinguish S.dudleyi from some other Sarcoscypha species. The spores are covered with a sheath of mucilage, which typically causes the eight spores of the ascus to be ejected together. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphal end cells in the hymenium) are slender, slightly enlarged above, and contain numerous red granules. The granules contain <b>carotenoid</b> pigments such as plectaniaxanthine or beta carotene, and give the fruit body its color.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of terns cannot {{accommodate}} under water, so {{they rely}} on accurate sighting from the air before they plunge-dive. Like other seabirds that feed at the surface or dive for food, terns have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas; birds that have to look through an air/water interface have more deeply coloured <b>carotenoid</b> pigments in the oil drops than other species. The pigment also improves visual contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions, and helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or other feeding birds. The red colouring reduces ultraviolet sensitivity, which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls, and this protects the eye from UV damage.|$|E
5|$|While {{many animals}} {{are unable to}} {{synthesize}} <b>carotenoid</b> pigments to create red and yellow surfaces, the green and blue colours of bird feathers and insect carapaces are usually not produced by pigments at all, but by structural coloration. Structural coloration means the production of colour by microscopically-structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light, sometimes in combination with pigments: for example, peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their structure makes them appear blue, turquoise and green. Structural coloration can produce the most brilliant colours, often iridescent. For example, the blue/green gloss on the plumage of birds such as ducks, and the purple/blue/green/red colours of many beetles and butterflies are created by structural coloration. Animals use several methods to produce structural colour, {{as described in the}} table.|$|E
40|$|In Bali {{there are}} several types of seaweed {{that has long been}} used as a source of food by people. These seaweed local name are Bulung Boni (Caulerpa spp.) and Bulung Sangu (Gracilaria spp.). However the study of total <b>carotenoids</b> content and types of <b>carotenoids</b> of these seaweed are very limited, {{therefore}} need to be further sudy. The types of <b>carotenoids</b> in this study identified based on the retention of value (Rf) on thin layer chromatography. This research concluded that total <b>carotenoids</b> of Bulung Boni (Caulerpa spp.) higher than Bulung Sangu (Gracilaria spp.).

40|$|Abstract — One of {{the roles}} of <b>carotenoids</b> in plants which are {{proposed}} is to serve as protecting agents against deleterious effects of light. The major mechanisms whereby <b>carotenoids</b> prevent harmful photooxidations in vitro and their suggested protective function in photosynthetic tissue, i. e. chioroplasts, will be summarized briefly. Fungi are non—photosynthetic plants, therefore lack the antenna function of <b>carotenoids</b> {{but some of them}} do contain <b>carotenoids</b> located in membranes as well. Thus, fungi can serve as a useful model system to study the potential function of <b>carotenoids</b> in protecting against photosensitized oxidations. Results obtained using the fungus Fusarium aQuaeductuum are presented which support the assumption that <b>carotenoids</b> indeed have the capacity to protect in vivo from the deleterious effects of light...|$|R
5|$|Pigments are {{coloured}} chemicals (such as melanin) {{in animal}} tissues. For example, the Arctic fox has a white coat in winter (containing little pigment), and a brown coat in summer (containing more pigment), {{an example of}} seasonal camouflage (a polyphenism). Many animals, including mammals, birds, and amphibians, are unable to synthesize most of the pigments that colour their fur or feathers, other than the brown or black melanins that give many mammals their earth tones. For example, the bright yellow of an American goldfinch, the startling orange of a juvenile red-spotted newt, the deep red of a cardinal and the pink of a flamingo are all produced by <b>carotenoid</b> pigments synthesized by plants. In {{the case of the}} flamingo, the bird eats pink shrimps, which are themselves unable to synthesize carotenoids. The shrimps derive their body colour from microscopic red algae, which like most plants are able to create their own pigments, including both carotenoids and (green) chlorophyll. Animals that eat green plants do not become green, however, as chlorophyll does not survive digestion.|$|E

40|$|Sea angels, Clione limacina and Paedoclione doliiformis, are small, {{floating}} sea slugs {{belonging to}} Gastropoda, and their gonads are a bright orange-red color.

L. helicina accumulated dietary algal <b>carotenoids</b> without modification. On the other hand, keto-carotenoids, such as pectenolone, 7, 8 -didehydroastaxanthin, and adonixanthin were identified as major <b>carotenoids</b> in the sea angels C. limacina and P.  doliiformis.

40|$|In animals yellow-orange-red sexual traits {{pigmented}} by <b>carotenoids</b> {{have been}} suggested to act as signals of current health. Because <b>carotenoids</b> have important physiological functions, individuals might trade-off allocating these pigments to self- maintenance versus coloration. <b>Carotenoids</b> may act as scavengers of free radicals that are released during an immune response. Here, we experimentally assessed whether a local cell-mediated immune response affects circulating <b>carotenoids,</b> antioxidant status, oxidative damage and {{the expression of a}} carotenoid-based trait. Male red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) were subcutaneously injected with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) or with phosphate buffer solution (controls). The effect of the treatment on circulating <b>carotenoids,</b> total plasma antioxidant status (TAS), lipid oxidative damage in erythrocytes (TBARS) and ornamentation was assessed. Immune challenge induced a 13 % decrease in circulating <b>carotenoids</b> within 24 h. However, this treatment did not affect TAS, TBARS or coloration. Coloration, circulating <b>carotenoids</b> and cell-mediated immune response were positively correlated, but these were not related to TAS or TBARS. <b>Carotenoids</b> were only weakly related to TAS after controlling for the effect of uric acid levels. These results suggest that carotenoid-based ornaments may honestly indicate immunocompetence but probably not antioxidant capacity in this species, and that <b>carotenoids</b> might be relatively weak antioxidants in the plasma. Furthermore, even a relatively harmless and locally elicited immune challenge had important effects on circulating <b>carotenoids,</b> but this effect {{did not appear to be}} associated with oxidative stress. Alternative mechanisms linking <b>carotenoids</b> to immunity (not necessarily relying on the use of these pigments as antioxidants) should be considered in future studies on birdsPeer reviewe...|$|R

25|$|The {{egg mass}} (roe) is usually green, {{but may also}} have yellow, red, or brown coloration.

The bilin and retinal produces the base green color, {{and the amount of}} relative idoxanthin content is the key determinant of the color variation. Study of its prey (such as the amphipods) or the fish's stomach contents reveal negligible traces of idoxanthin and crustaxanthin, which means the fish must be internally converting other <b>carotenoid</b> substances such as astaxanthin that are abundant in their food into idoxanthin and crustaxanthin, given that fish in general cannot build their own <b>carotenoid</b> wholly out of building block materials. Researchers hypothesize that the intake of astaxanthin influences the idoxanthin concentration in the body, which result in the egg color change.|$|E
