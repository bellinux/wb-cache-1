First, we develop a multi-period dynamic {{multi-process}} network DEA (data envelopment analysis) model. Second, we apply this methodology to Japanese prefectural time series data. In this framework, we specify that prefectural technology consists of two sectors, called the human capital generating sector and the physical capital formation sector. Each sector has its own exogenous inputs, <b>and</b> <b>carry-overs</b> in preceding <b>and</b> subsequent periods as well as final output. We assume that the final output is jointly produced by the two sectors. This workshop is supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 22310093 under the title “Theory and Applications of Dynamic DEA with Network Structure. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to develop the variables which moderate the relationship between <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> transportation services and to analyze the moderating effects of the variables. The conceptual and operational definitions of the variables were ascertained from prior research. The {{reliability and validity of}} collected data were tested by various methods and hypotheses are tested by a moderated regression analysis. The results are as follows. First, the moderating variables on the relationship between <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> transportation services are identified as internal orientation and market orientation. The former has three sub-dimensions such as collaboration between departments, work standardization and process improving and the latter has three sub-dimensions such as intelligence generation, intelligence dissemination, and responsiveness. Second, work standardization is ascertained to enhance the relationship between <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> trust. Third, process improving is verified as enhancing the relationship between <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> trust. Fourth, work standardization is ascertained to enhance the relationship between <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> flexibility. Fifth, intelligence generation is identified as enhancing the relationship between <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> trust. Sixth, intelligence generation is verified as enhancing the relationship between <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> flexibility. Therefore, forwarders can supply superior transportation services for customers when they achieve <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> orientation such as work standardization, improvement of their service processes, and activities concerned with intelligence generation...|$|R
40|$|This study’s aim is {{to examine}} the {{relationship}} among job satisfaction, organizational <b>commitment,</b> <b>and</b> turnover intention of employees. A model of job satisfaction, organizational <b>commitment,</b> <b>and</b> turnover intention is developed and tested in one field study. In this study, using a 250 employees of a Turkish manufacturing company, were given questionnaires to complete during regular working hours; 188 completed questionnaires were returned [...] Job satisfaction, organizational <b>commitment,</b> <b>and</b> turnover intention are popular topics in the study of work related attitudes. The main objective {{of this article is to}} test the relationships among job satisfaction, organizational <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> turnover intention. Structural equation modeling to test research hypotheses is used and the model that has high reliability and validity is developed. The results indicate that job satisfaction is one of the most antecedents of organizational <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> turnover intention and suggest that high levels of job satisfaction results in higher <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> lower turnover intention so job satisfaction positively influences on affective <b>commitment,</b> continuance <b>commitment,</b> <b>and</b> normative <b>commitment</b> while it is negatively impact on turnover intention. The results emphasize the need to consider the factors can be having effects on the relationship by highlighting to studies conducted on job satisfaction, organizational <b>commitment,</b> <b>and</b> turnover intention. </p...|$|R

We used longitudinal data (N = 249) to test whether the length of exposure to neighbourhood poverty between age 16 and 21 predicts work <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> unemployment at age 25.

40|$|Organisational <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> job {{satisfaction}} are important measures of employee {{performance in the}} workplace. Although employee <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> {{job satisfaction}} have been studied extensively, their links with organisational performance have not often been considered. The research establishes measures of <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> job satisfaction using data obtained from workers in a multi-national hotel chain. Commitment is conceptualised {{by means of an}} adapted OCQ. Job satisfaction is conceptualised by means of an adapted MSQ. The measures are then used to compare the <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> job satisfaction of workers in hotels in Mexico and China, judged to be well-performing and poorly-performing national hotel groups respectively. Links between the measures and organisational performance are explored. The resulting adapted measures are shown to measure effectively the <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> job satisfaction of employees in the hotel industry. Using the measures to compare hotel groups in Mexico and China shows significantly different levels of value <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> intrinsic job satisfaction between low and high performing hotels. Commitment is shown to be a significant predictor of financial performance and guest satisfaction.

Other factors influencing employee <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> loyalty are age and tenure, whilst workplace level characteristics of importance are: supervision; performance related pay and long term employment prospects within the workplace. With respect to the effects of employee <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> loyalty upon the workplace, higher CLI is associated with enhanced workplace performance. This result holds for a number of robustness checks, thereby highlighting a hitherto neglected conduit for improved workplace performance.

40|$|There {{had been}} well known claims of "provably unbreakable" quantum {{protocols}} for bit <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> coin tossing. However, we, and independently Mayers, showed that all proposed quantum bit <b>commitment</b> (<b>and</b> coin tossing) schemes are, in principle, insecure because the sender, Alice, can always cheat successfully {{by using an}} EPR-type of attack and delaying her measurements. One might wonder if secure quantum bit <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> coin tossing protocols exist at all. Here we prove that an EPR-type of attack by Alice will, in principle, break any realistic quantum bit <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> ideal coin tossing scheme. Therefore, provided that Alice has a quantum computer and is capable of storing quantum signals for an arbitrary length of time, all those schemes are insecure. Since bit <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> coin tossing are useful primitives for building up more sophisticated protocols such as zero-knowledge proofs, our results cast very serious doubt on the security of quantum cryptography in the so-called "post-cold-war" applications...|$|R
