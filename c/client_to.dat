5|$|On March 8, 2010, Valve {{announced}} that Steam was developing a client for OS X. The announcement {{was preceded by}} {{a change in the}} Steam beta <b>client</b> <b>to</b> support the cross-platform WebKit web browser rendering engine instead of the Trident engine of Internet Explorer. Before this announcement, Valve teased the release by e-mailing several images to Mac community and gaming websites; the images featured characters from Valve games with Apple logos and parodies of vintage Macintosh advertisements. Valve developed a full video homage to Apple's 1984 Macintosh commercial to announce the availability of Half-Life 2 and its episodes on the service; some concept images for the video had previously been used to tease the Mac Steam client.|$|E
5|$|Once {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the series was a favored project at NBC, Littlefield reported that he was getting calls from every agent in town, wanting their <b>client</b> <b>to</b> {{be a part of the}} series. Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles. The casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had applied for each role down to 75. Those who received a callback read again in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright. At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, and were asked to read for Les Moonves, then-president of Warner Bros. Television.|$|E
5|$|Hanada and Kasuga {{pick up a}} car {{designated}} for the job which unexpectedly has a corpse in the back seat. They dispose of the body, then meet the client and proceed towards their destination. En route Hanada spots an ambush. He dispatches a number of gunmen while Kasuga panics and flails about in hysterics. Foaming at the mouth, Kasuga charges an ambusher, Koh, the fourth-ranked hitman, and they kill each other. Hanada leaves the <b>client</b> <b>to</b> secure Koh's car but hears three gunshots and rushes back to find the client is safe and three additional ambushers have been shot cleanly through the forehead. At a second ambush, Hanada kills more gunmen and sets Sakura, the second-ranked hitman, on fire. Sakura madly rushes towards the client but is shot dead by him. On his way home Hanada's car breaks down. Misako, a mysterious woman with a deathwish, stops and gives him a ride. At home, he has rough sex with his wife, fueled by his obsession with sniffing boiling rice.|$|E
50|$|At first, servers were {{isolated}} {{from one another}} as with Napster, but later versions of the eDonkey2000 server software enabled servers to form a search network. This allowed servers to forward search queries from their locally connected <b>clients</b> <b>to</b> other servers, allowing <b>clients</b> <b>to</b> effectively find peers connected to any server on the server network, thereby increasing download swarm size. It also allowed <b>clients</b> <b>to</b> find and download files not available from <b>clients</b> connected <b>to</b> the same server.|$|R
50|$|This product allows SIP <b>clients</b> <b>to</b> {{exchange}} IM's {{and presence}} using the SIMPLE protocol. The client also allows two <b>clients</b> <b>to</b> set up audio/video sessions, application sharing, and file transfer sessions.|$|R
50|$|Another {{solution}} is <b>to</b> permit <b>clients</b> <b>to</b> connect {{to a new}} relay and resume streaming from where they left off by their old relay. Relays would retain a back buffer <b>to</b> permit <b>clients</b> <b>to</b> resume streaming from anywhere {{within the range of}} said buffer. This would essentially be an extension to the Icecast protocol.|$|R
5|$|In September 2008, Valve {{added support}} for Steam Cloud, {{a service that}} can {{automatically}} store saved game and related custom files on Valve's servers; users can access this data from any machine running the Steam client. Games must use the appropriate features of Steamworks for Steam Cloud to work. Users can disable this feature on a per-game and per-account basis. In May 2012, the service added the ability for users to manage their game libraries from remote clients, including computers and mobile devices; users can instruct Steam to download and install games they own through this service if their Steam client is currently active and running. Some games sold through retail channels can be redeemed as titles for users' libraries within Steam by entering a product code within the software. For games that incorporate Steamworks, users can buy redemption codes from other vendors and redeem these in the Steam <b>client</b> <b>to</b> add the title to their libraries. Steam also offers a framework for selling and distributing downloadable content (DLC) for games.|$|E
5|$|The {{mutilated}} body of {{the fourth}} woman, prostitute Annie Chapman, was discovered at about 6:00am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway {{in the back yard}} of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. Chapman had left her lodgings at 2am on the day she was murdered, with the intention of getting money from a <b>client</b> <b>to</b> pay her rent. Her throat was cut from left to right. She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, George Bagster Phillips, was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6–8inches (15–20cm) long. However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts. As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.|$|E
5|$|However, Nosanchuk {{was still}} not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a {{defendant}} found not guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's Executive Council, acting {{on the advice of}} a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a plea bargain, offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his <b>client</b> <b>to</b> plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under these terms, the state still had the right to detain him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

For example, a MITM attacker could tell <b>clients</b> <b>to</b> use basic access authentication or legacy RFC2069 digest access authentication mode. To extend this further, digest access authentication provides no mechanism for <b>clients</b> <b>to</b> verify the server's identity ...|$|R

25|$|Since {{applications}} {{can communicate}} either {{with or without}} TLS (or SSL), {{it is necessary for}} the <b>client</b> <b>to</b> indicate to the server the setup of a TLS connection. One of the main ways of achieving this is to use a different port number for TLS connections, for example port 443 for HTTPS. Another mechanism is for the <b>client</b> <b>to</b> make a protocol-specific request to the server to switch the connection to TLS; for example, by making a STARTTLS request when using the mail and news protocols.|$|E
50|$|After leaving UBS, Lack {{served as}} a {{business}} partner of Renzo, who directed <b>clients</b> <b>to</b> him. Like Renzo, Lack advised his American <b>clients</b> not <b>to</b> cooperate with U.S. authorities or partake in the IRS's voluntary disclosure program created {{in the wake of}} the UBS tax evasion scandal. He provided a prepaid cell phone <b>to</b> some <b>clients,</b> <b>to</b> be used to contact him to thwart surveillance by law enforcement agencies.|$|R

5000|$|A {{survey of}} some NASD/FINRA {{disciplinary}} actions illustrates the broad scope {{of not only}} the types of investments that are [...] "sold away" [...] but also the types of brokerage firms. In one example, an adviser from Summit Capital Investment Group convinced 25 <b>clients</b> <b>to</b> invest in a fraudulent pay phone leasing deal. In another example, a rep from Linsco/Private Ledger Corporation (now rebranded LPL Financial) convinced <b>clients</b> <b>to</b> invest in a limited liability company (LLC) investing in real estate. Another example involved a PaineWebber rep who convinced <b>clients</b> <b>to</b> invest in an IPO trading program that was run by an outside entity.|$|R
25|$|Another attack used {{successfully}} is to forward the <b>client</b> <b>to</b> a bank's legitimate website, then {{to place a}} popup window requesting credentials {{on top of the}} page {{in a way that makes}} many users think the bank is requesting this sensitive information.|$|E

25|$|This type {{of therapy}} uses {{a blend of}} cognitive, {{behavioral}} and some humanistic training techniques to target the stressors of the client. This usually is used to help clients better cope with their stress or anxiety after stressful events. This is a three-phase process that trains the <b>client</b> <b>to</b> use skills that they already have to better adapt to their current stressors. The first phase is an interview phase that includes psychological testing, client self-monitoring, {{and a variety of}} reading materials. This allows the therapist to individually tailor the training process to the client. Clients learn how to categorize problems into emotion-focused or problem-focused, so that they can better treat their negative situations. This phase ultimately prepares the <b>client</b> <b>to</b> eventually confront and reflect upon their current reactions to stressors, before looking at ways to change their reactions and emotions in relation to their stressors. The focus is conceptualization.|$|E
