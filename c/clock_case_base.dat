In this work we present JUST, a technique {{to reduce the size}} of a <b>case</b> <b>base</b> while maintaining the classification accuracy of the CBR system. JUST uses justifications in order to select a subset of cases from the original <b>case</b> <b>base</b> that will form the new reduced <b>case</b> <b>base.</b> A justification is an explanation that the CBR system generates to justify the solution found for a given problem. Moreover, we present empirical evaluation in various data sets showing that JUST is an effective <b>case</b> <b>base</b> reduction technique that maintains the classification accuracy of the <b>case</b> <b>base.</b> Keywords: CBR, <b>Case</b> <b>Base</b> Management, <b>Case</b> <b>Base</b> Reduction. ...|$|R
