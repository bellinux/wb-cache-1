Large mortalities arising from pathogens, parasitoids, soil invertebrate predators and possibly Carabidae and Staphylinidae predators can be discounted in populations at Wairakei in the central North Island.

Studies in the EU MASTER project show that carabid beetles can feed on larvae of oilseed rape pests (e. g. Piper & Williams, 2004), but to identify them as potential biocontrol agents it must be shown that significant numbers encounter the prey in the field. In this two-year study, the spatio-temporal {{relationships between}} carabids and cabbage stem flea beetle (Psylliodes chrysocephala) have already been reported (Warner et al., 2003). Now, we compare carabid distributions with those of pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus), cabbage <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> (<b>stem</b> <b>weevil)</b> (Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus) and cabbage seed weevil (seed weevil) (Ceutorhynchus assimilis) larvae dropping to the soil to pupate...|$|R

40|$|Mixing {{plant species}} in agroecosystems is {{highlighted}} as an agroecological solution to reduce pesticides and fertilizers while maintaining profitability. In the French context, intercropping frost-sensitive legume crops with winter oilseed rape is potentially interesting {{and began to}} be implemented by farmers. In this study we aimed at measuring the services and disservices of this intercrop with three different legume mixtures, in terms of growth and yield for rapeseed, ground cover of weeds in autumn and damage caused by rape winter <b>stem</b> <b>weevil.</b> The experiment was carried out at four sites from 2011 to 2014. We showed higher total aerial dry weights and total aerial nitrogen contents in the intercrops compared to sole winter oilseed rape in November. The companion plants contributed to the control of weeds and the mitigation of rape winter <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> damage, notably through {{the increase in the}} total aerial weight. In spring, after destruction of the companion plants, the intercrops had partially compensated a reduction in the N fertilization rate (- 30 kg per hectare) in terms of aerial nitrogen content in rapeseed, with no consequences on the yield which was maintained or even increased. There were probably other interactions such as an improvement in rapeseed root exploration. The consequences were an increase in the nitrogen use efficiency in intercrops. The intercrop with faba bean and lentil showed the best results in terms of autumn growth, weed control, reduction in rape winter <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> damage, and rapeseed N content in spring and yield. Intercropping frost-sensitive legume crops with winter oilseed rape is thus a promising way to reconcile yield and reduction in pesticides and fertilizer use and perhaps to benefit more widely to the cropping system...|$|R
50|$|The Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> is {{native to}} South America where it is present in Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia and Chile.

40|$|The Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil,</b> Listronotus bonariensis (Kuschel) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is {{the most}} {{important}} pest species in New Zealand, costing the pastoral industry an estimated NZ$ 78 - 251 m per year (Prestidge et al., 1991). The parasitoid wasp Microctonus hyperodae Loan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was released in New Zealand in 1991 as a potential biological control agent of the weevil (Goldson et al., 1994). As M. hyperodae is a pro-ovigenic species, its lifetime complement of eggs is set at adult emergence (Phillips, 1998). Adult wasp fitness is likely to be affected by host nutrition, as resources carried over from immature stages to the adult stage of parasitoids can vary with the size and nutritional quality of the host (Jervis et al., 2001). The fecundity of Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> can increase after the addition of pollen to its diet (Evans. and Barratt, 1995). Conversely, a decrease in gonad development (i. e., vitellarium development and percentage of females with oocyte resorption) can occur after consumption of ryegrass containing endophyte (Barker and Addison, 1996). This research investigates tri-trophic-Ievel interactions on parasitoid fitness (i. e., egg load and body size) by assessing field-collected adult weevils, and by providing bee-collected pollen, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench cv. Katowase) pollen, ryegrass-only (Lolium multiflorum L. cv. Tama), or ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lambrechtsen cv. Aries) containing endophyte (Neotyphodium lolii (Latch, Christensen and Samuels) Glenn, Bacon and Hanlin in the host diet in the laboratory. A survey was conducted in the Lincoln area to what extent pollen was part of the diet of field collected Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevils.</b> The frequency and types of pollen grains consumed were analysed. Also, gut fullness (in terms of ryegrass particle content), parasitoid larval presence, weevil gender and weevil gonad development were also assessed. Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> adults fed on pollen in the field, although a low proportion of them contained pollen in their gut. Gonad development was positively correlated with the extent of pollen consumption (i. e., number of individuals with sexually mature gonads). A cage experiment was conducted in the laboratory. Potentially parasitised adult Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevils</b> were collected from ryegrass on roadsides in the Lincoln area during 2004. They were randomly allocated to four treatments: ryegrass-only (control), ryegrass plus bee collected pollen, ryegrass plus buckwheat pollen, and ryegrass with endophyte, each replicated four times. Water was provided in every treatment. The parasitoids that emerged were assessed for size (i. e., hind leg tibial length) and potential fecundity (i. e., egg load) (see Phillips and Baird, 2001). Despite the fact that the addition of bee-collected or buckwheat pollen to the host diet had no significant effect on the number of adult parasitoids emerged, their body size or egg load (P > 0. 05), some factors that could have affected a potentially positive correlation between parasitoid fitness and pollen consumption are discussed. Similarly, the addition of ryegrass with endophyte had no significant effect on the number of adult parasitoids emerged, their body size or egg load (P > 0. 05). This leads to the suggestion that biological control (i. e., M. hyperodae) and plant resistance (i. e., endophyte) strategies can work in a complementary way in integrated pest management programmes. The concept of benefiting the third trophic level with 'resource subsidies' made available selectively to the second level has the potential to lead to the suggestion of a new mechanism for enhancing parasitoid fitness, that is 'indirect' conservation biocontrol...|$|R
40|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{presence}} of systemic endophytic fungi in agriculturally important New Zealand grasses were studied in relation to plant breeding. Seedling resistance to adult Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding in perennial ryegrass, Italian ryegrass and tall fescue was found {{to be related to the}} presence of their respective Acremonium endophytes in the seed rather than to plant genetic resistance. In addition a study of perennial ryegrass revealed that this resistance was independent of endophyte viability. The seedling resistance conferred by the endophyte of Italian ryegrass was found to be beneficial for field establishment. This endophyte differs from that in perennial ryegrass and tall fescue in that it does not confer resistance to Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> on mature plants, but only on seedlings. The extent of plant genetic seedling tolerance to adult Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding was limited to broad inter-specific differences, with tall fescue more tolerant than perennial ryegrass and both of these more tolerant than Italian ryegrass. This ranking corresponds with previous observations on feeding preference on mature plants. A study of factors affecting the concentration of endophyte mycelia in infected seed of perennial ryegrass revealed that plant genetic factors had little effect. The major factors studied were: 1) the endophyte concentration in the maternal parent plant directly influenced the endophyte concentration in the seed. 2) nitrogen fertilizer applications to a seed crop reduced the concentration of mycelia in the seed, with earlier applications having a greater effect. 3) application of the fungicide propiconazole (Tilt) to a seed crop reduced the endophyte concentration in the seed. 4) the endophyte concentration in the seed was found to directly influence the endophyte concentration in seedlings, six month old plants and that of seed harvested from a first year seed crop. As there have been no previous reports of tetraploid perennial ryegrass cultivars with endophyte an experiment was conducted to determine if these could be developed by the standard procedure of colchicine treatment. The results revealed that endophyte was retained following colchicine treatment...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} was planned and undertaken to obtain further {{evidence on the}} association of the Loliumendophyte (a fungus parasitic in some perennial ryegrass) with the occurrence of ryegrass staggers in sheep (Fletcher & Harvey, 1981). In the experiment, 39 sheep grazing four plots established with perennial rye-grass seed (Lolium perenne) highly (> 90 %) infected with the endophyte all developed clinical ryegrass staggers over a 26 day grazing period. The same number of sheep grazing plots established from seed found to have negligible (< 3 X) endophyte infec-t ion showed no evidence of ryegrass staggers. The results clearly confirm that Lo/&m-endophvte infested ryegrass pastures are {{closely associated with the}} occurrence of ryegrass staggers in sheep. Observations made during regrowth of the ryegrass plots {{at the end of the}} grazing period showed that there was a 3 to 4 -fold greater production of dry matter from the high endophyte plots than from the low endophyte plots. The poor regrowth and low production recorded in low endophyte plots was found to be largely due to pasture predation by the Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> (Lisfronotus bonariensis). There is a firm indication that Lolium-endophyte infection of ryegrass confers resistance to <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> predations. This finding is discussed in relation to the field control of ryegrass staggers.

5000|$|Phoma black stem infections {{can occur}} {{throughout}} the growing season, although the lesions are more noticeable during late summer. Phoma macdonaldii penetrates into the plants either directly via enzymatic {{degradation of the}} plant cell wall or by mechanical pressure. [...] The fungus overwinters in infected crop debris. Primary inoculum originates from overwintering fungal structures (perithecia, pycnidia, and mycelia). Conidia (from pycnidia) and ascospores (from perithecia) are released from fruiting structures and subsequently dispersed by rain and wind. Disease development is favorable in wet conditions during flowering stage and immediately after flowering stage.

40|$|Loss in seed {{yield and}} {{therefore}} decrease in plant fitness due to simultaneous attacks by multiple herbivores {{is not necessarily}} additive, as demonstrated in evolutionary studies on wild plants. However, {{it is not clear}} how this transfers to crop plants that grow in very different conditions compared to wild plants. Nevertheless, loss in crop seed yield caused by any single pest is most often studied in isolation although crop plants are attacked by many pests that can cause substantial yield losses. This is especially important for crops able to compensate and even overcompensate for the damage. We investigated the interactive impacts on crop yield of four insect pests attacking different plant parts at different times during the cropping season. In 15 oilseed rape fields in Sweden, we estimated the damage caused by seed and <b>stem</b> <b>weevils,</b> pollen beetles, and pod midges. Pest pressure varied drastically among fields with very low correlation among pests, allowing us to explore interactive impacts on yield from attacks by multiple species. The plant damage caused by each pest species individually had, as expected, either no, or a negative impact on seed yield and the strongest negative effect was caused by pollen beetles. However, seed yield increased when plant damage caused by both seed and <b>stem</b> <b>weevils</b> was high, presumably due to the joint plant compensatory reaction to insect attack leading to overcompensation. Hence, attacks by several pests can change the impact on yield of individual pest species. Economic thresholds based on single species, on which pest management decisions currently rely, may therefore result in economically suboptimal choices being made and unnecessary excessive use of insecticides...|$|R

The laboratory tarsal plate test, carried out in May 2006, was based on commercial formulations of τ-fluvalinate and λ-cyhalothrin instead of pure a. i. The study aimed at producing practical recommendations about the reduction of the application rate in the chemical protection of the oil seed rape (OSR) against the pod and the <b>stem</b> <b>weevils</b> and against the pollen beetle.

40|$|Many organic farmers {{hesitate}} to grow winter oilseed rape (WOSR), despite its usefulness for crop rotations and animal fodder, {{because it is}} attacked by many insects, which are difficult to control without chemical treatments. In a geographically broad network of farmer’s fields, we analysed the effect of various crop management factors and of the surrounding field environment on a large range of insects known to damage WOSR: root maggot (Delia radicum L.), {{cabbage stem flea beetle}} (Psylliodes chrysocephala L.), rape <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> (Ceuthorhynchus napi Gyl) and pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus F.). Our results confirm the effect of sowing date, plant density and soil tillage regime on root maggot attacks and cabbage stem flea beetle larva infestation. Early sowing tended to increase root maggot damage whereas it was associated with a lower level of attack of cabbage stem flea beetle. High plant density tended to decrease the damage or the attack of all insects. We show that nitrogen availability in the soil affect cabbage stem flea beetle, <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> levels and pollen beetle damage: the negative effect of soil nitrogen content on pollen beetle damage {{may be related to the}} significant effect of nitrogen on plant vigour and, therefore, to the compensation of pollen beetle damage on new racemes. If all insects were considered together, the proportion of land under WOSR in the region and the surrounding environment had a significant effect on pest occurrence. In regions with a high proportion of land under WOSR, the proportion of plants attacked by root maggot and pollen beetle tended to increase. Conversely, regions with high proportions of land under WOSR tended to have a smaller proportion of plants with cabbage stem flea beetle larvae or damage, whatever the environment surrounding the field. For almost all the pests considered, the fields displaying the most severe pest attacks in regions with more than 1. 2 % WOSR were bounded by trees, hedges and bushes. Conversely, in regions with a lower percentage of land under WOSR, woodland around the field reduced the occurrence of pest attack...|$|R
50|$|Attempts {{have been}} made in New Zealand to biologically control the Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil.</b> The braconid wasp Microctonus hyperodae is a {{parasitoid}} of the pest in South America and has been introduced to control it.

Several species of endophytic fungi, especially Acremonium spp., have also been studied with a view to biological control in New Zealand. Their presence inside the crop plant deters egg-laying by the weevil and reduces the damage done by the larvae, however Acremonium lolii renders perennial ryegrass toxic to livestock at some stages of growth, putting them at risk of developing the disease perennial ryegrass staggers.|$|R

50|$|Perennial {{ryegrass}} staggers {{is caused}} by the ingestion of grass that is infected by the endophyte fungus Epichloë festucae var lolli, and this fungus produces a variety of toxins such as peramine, a pyrrolopyrazine alkaloid, and lolitrem B, an indole-diterpene compound. There is no external sign when perennial ryegrass is infected by this fungus. The Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> (Listronotus bonariensis) feeds on perennial ryegrass. When the grass on which they are feeding is infected by the fungus, the larvae of the weevil fail to develop fully. In an effort to breed perennial ryegrass that was resistant to the weevil, researchers in New Zealand inadvertently selected strains that were susceptible to the fungus. In fact the endophytic fungus forms a mutualistic association with the grass which grows more vigorously as a result and produces more tillers.

The effects of seven flower species on the longevity of Microctonus hyperodae (Hymenoptera Braconidae), a parasitoid of the Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil,</b> Listronotus bonariensis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), were measured in the laboratory. The flowers were phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), alyssum (Lobularia maritima), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), white clover (Trifolium repens), red clover (Trifolium pratense) and white mustard (Sinapis alba). The results suggested M. hyperodae was unable to reach nectar of red clover, white clover, alyssum and phacelia, but was able to gain access to the nectar of the other three species. However, only buckwheat and coriander increased its longevity. Flower corolla aperture and depth probably determined the parasitoid’s access to nectar. Accessible nectars were analyzed for sugar composition and the effect of the sucrose/(glucose + fructose) ratio on nectar suitability was assessed. The relevance of these results to other hymenopteran parasitoid species is discussed in terms of selecting the most appropriate floral diversity in agricultural extensification programmes. ...|$|R

ASW damage, endophyte and peramine concentration were measured in three perennial ryegrass cultivars, (HSG diploid, standard diploid and a tetraploid) containing AR 1 endophyte, under high and no N fertiliser application. The proportion of tillers damaged by ASW adults or larvae did not differ significantly between cultivars. However, ASW adults tended (P< 0. 10) to prefer the standard diploid and tetraploid cultivars over the HSG cultivar. Our results are in keeping with previous observations that higher sugar diploid cultivars may have lower endophyte and peramine content than a STD diploid cultivar, but this {{does not appear to have}} reduced resistance to ASW.

Floral architecture measurements and nectar quality analysis were used to understand the floral selectivity and consequent 'preferences' of the parasitoids. A wider corolla aperture and a shorter corolla depth, {{as well as the}} sucrose/(glucose+fructose) ratio of the nectar were positively correlated with the longevity of M hyperodae. These results were compared with those for other parasitoids. Lifetime carbohydrate reserves were analysed in continuously-fed and unfed (water control) M. hyperodae in the laboratory. Total sugar levels (as a measure of nutritional state) decreased continuously throughout unfed parasitoids' lifespans, whereas in continuously-fed individuals, levels increased initially and then decreased. Glucose dominated in the unfed parasitoids while glucose and fructose dominated in the fed individuals. The common insect haemolymph sugar, trehalose, was not detected in unfed M. hyperodae, but was detected in fed parasitoids. Parasitoids that fed from buckwheat in the laboratory showed higher sucrose levels immediately after feeding, but these declined to the levels observed in honey-fed individuals after one hour. The fructose/total sugars (f/t) ratio was clearly different between the fed and unfed M. hyperodae. This ratio was a good indicator for distinguishing fed from unfed parasitoids and was therefore a useful tool for understanding the feeding history of M. hyperodae. Buckwheat was deployed in the field to assess parasitoid abundance at different distances from the floral resources. The highest number of M. hyperodae occurred near buckwheat plots. The number rapidly declined with increasing distance and was at its lowest at 7 to 8 m, followed by increasing numbers. Parasitoid numbers significantly increased near buckwheat plots compared with the middle and furthest distances. Field-collected parasitoids were analysed to determine their nutritional state and feeding history. A high proportion (79 %) of parasitoids collected near buckwheat plots had fed and, therefore, had an increased total sugar level and fit ratio. Only 20 % collected from grasses on road-side verges apparently had access to sugar sources. The fit ratio in combination with total sugar levels was a useful tool to understand the nutritional state and feeding history of field-collected parasitoids. The effect of buckwheat deployment in the field on parasitism rates of L. bonariensis was measured. Parasitism rates of the first summer generation of L. bonariensis near buckwheat plots were increased by 250 % compared with the controls. Parasitism rates of the second summer generation of L. bonariensis did not differ between those near buckwheat and the controls...|$|R

Ten lambs were grazed on Grasslands Nui ryegrass without endophyte or with its wild-type or a high ergovaline-producing endophyte (196). Five lambs from the 196 treatment were swapped for 5 on the endophyte-free treatment after 20 days. Rectal temperatures and respiration rates were measured daily; {{on one day}} they were measured every 2 - 4 hours. There {{was a significant difference}} in respiration rate and body temperature between lambs grazing endophyte and endophyte-free treatments but not between the two endophyte treatments. There was no interaction with ambient temperature within the range 12 - 30 °C. When lambs where transferred from toxic to non-toxic treatments there was no significant decrease in body temperature or respiration rate witbin 14 days. Ergovaline, even at low concentrations, affects thermo-regulation in lambs and is undesirable in {{perennial ryegrass}}lendophyte associations. Little is known of the interaction of these toxic associations with short- and long-term fluctuations in environmental conditions and the response in animals grazing such associations. Furthermore, the lag time in animal response after introduction and removal to and from toxic pastures has not been studied for the different ryegrasslendophyte associations.

40|$|In {{examining}} {{the relationship between}} Graphania mutans (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and perennial ryegrass infected with the fungal endophyte Acremonium lolii (Latch in press), the biology of G. mutans was investigated. Two types of larval development are identified: 'fast-track' larvae develop more rapidly through fewer instars and grow much larger than 'slow-track' larvae when reared on both artificial diet and perennial ryegrass. The complexity of Graphania speciation is discussed. The presence of endophyte is shown to confer on perennial ryegrass resistance to G. mutans larvae in the laboratory, with strong antixenosis and possible antibiosis effects exhibited. Feeding preference tests show that neonate and sixth instar fast-track larvae significantly prefer excised endophyte-free ryegrass to endophyte-infected leaves. The effects of endophyte {{on the development of}} fast-track and slow-track larvae are to decrease larval weight, head capsule width, and the number of successful pupations. The same methods were used {{to determine the effects of}} peramine (an antifeedant compound for Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> extracted from endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass) on fast-track G. mutans larvae. Incorporated into artificial diet at 10 ppm, peramine has no affect on neonate and sixth instar larval feeding preference. peramine does affect larval development, causing reduced larval weight, delayed pupation, and, increased mortality. The role of peramine in endophyte-induced resistance, and the possible adaptive significance for perennial ryegrass of endophyte infection is considered. The interactions between G. mutans, endophyte and perennial ryegrass within the pasture ecosystem are discussed, and suggestions and hypotheses presented for future investigation...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{regulation}} of chemical pesticides and rapid evolution of pesticide resistance have increased calls for sustainable pest management. Biological control offers sustainable pest suppres- sion, partly because evolution {{of resistance to}} predators and parasitoids is prevented by several factors (e. g., spatial or tempo- ral refuges from attacks, reciprocal evolution by control agents, and contrasting selection pressures from other enemy species). However, evolution of resistance may become more probable as agricultural intensification reduces the availability of refuges and diversity of enemy species, or if control agents have genetic barriers to evolution. Here, we use 21 years of field data from 196 sites across New Zealand to show that parasitism of a key pasture pest (Listronotus bonariensis, Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil)</b> by an introduced parasitoid (Microctonus hyperodae) was initially nationally successful, but then declined by 44 % (leading to pasture damage of c. NZD $ 160 m p. a.). This decline was not attributable to parasitoid numbers released, elevation or local climatic variables at sample locations. Rather, in all locations the decline began 7 years (14 host generations) following parasitoid introduction, despite re- leases being staggered across locations in different years. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that declining parasitism rates occurred in ryegrass Lolium perenne, which is grown nationwide in high-intensity pastures, but not in adjacent plots of a less-common pasture grass (Lolium multiflorum), indicating that resistance to parasitism is host-plant dependent. We conclude that low plant and enemy biodiversity in intensive large-scale agriculture may facilitate the evolution of host resistance by pests and threaten the long-term viability of biological control...|$|R
40|$|Folivory is {{the best}} studied plant-herbivore interaction, but {{it is unclear whether}} the {{signaling}} and resistance traits important for the defense of leaves are also important for other plant parts. Larvae of the tobacco <b>stem</b> <b>weevil,</b> Trichobaris mucorea, burrow into stems of Nicotiana attenuata and feed on the pith. Transgenic N. attenuata lines silenced in signaling and foliar defense traits were evaluated in a 2 -year field study for resistance against attack by naturally occurring T. mucorea larva. Plants silenced in early jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis (antisense [as]-lipoxygenase 3 [lox 3]; inverted repeat [ir]-allene oxide cyclase), JA perception (as-coronatine insensitive 1), proteinase inhibitors (ir-pi), and nicotine (ir-putrescine methyl-transferase) direct defenses and lignin (ir-cad) biosynthesis were infested more frequently than wild-type plants. Plants unable to emit C 6 aldehydes (as-hpl) had lower infestation rates, while plants silenced in late steps in JA biosynthesis (ir-acyl-coenzyme A oxidase, ir-opr) and silenced in diterpene glycoside production (ir-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase) did not differ from wild type. Pith choice assays revealed that ir-putrescine methyl-transferase, ir-coronatine insensitive 1, and ir-lox 3 pith, which all had diminished nicotine levels, were preferred by larvae compared to wild-type pith. The lack of preference for ir-lox 2 and ir-cad piths, suggest that oviposition attraction and vascular defense, rather than pith palatability accounts for the higher attack rates observed for these plants. We conclude that traits that influence a plant’s apparency, stem hardness, and pith direct defenses all contribute to resistance against this herbivore whose attack can be devastating to N. attenuata’s fitness...|$|R
