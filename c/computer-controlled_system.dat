25|$|Dynamic {{positioning}} (DP) is a <b>computer-controlled</b> <b>system</b> {{to automatically}} maintain a vessel's position and heading by using its own propellers and thrusters. Position reference sensors, combined with wind sensors, motion sensors and gyrocompasses, provide {{information to the}} computer pertaining to the vessel's position and the magnitude and direction of environmental forces affecting its position. Examples of vessel types that employ DP include, {{but are not limited}} to, ships and semi-submersible mobile offshore drilling units (MODU), oceanographic research vessels, cable layer ships and cruise ships.|$|E
25|$|During 2012, the building's {{four hundred}} {{metal halide lamps}} and {{floodlights}} were replaced with 1,200 LED fixtures, increasing the available colors from nine to over 16 million. The <b>computer-controlled</b> <b>system</b> allows the building to be illuminated {{in ways that were}} unable to be done previously with plastic gels. For instance, on November 6, 2012, CNN used the top of the Empire State Building as a scoreboard for the 2012 United States presidential election. When incumbent president Barack Obama had reached the 270 electoral votes necessary to win re-election, the lights turned blue. Had Republican challenger Mitt Romney won, the building would have been lit red. Also, on November 26, 2012, the building had its first ever synchronized light show, using music from recording artist Alicia Keys. The building's owners adhere to strict standards in using the lights; for instance, they would not use the lights to play advertisements.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Naperville was {{designated}} a White House Millennium Community, {{due to the}} construction of the Moser Tower and Millennium Carillon. The tower is a bell tower just north of Aurora Avenue and at the base of Rotary Hill within the Riverwalk Park complex. The Carillon is designated as a Grand Carillon, with 72 bells, and is one of only four in the world that span six octaves. It was dedicated in an Independence Day event on June 29, 2000, with a reception attended by over 15,000, and a performance by the Naperville Municipal Band and the Naperville Men's Glee Club and Festival Chorus. The Carillon is both manually and also computer-playable, with most performances done by hand, but with half the bells played by a <b>computer-controlled</b> <b>system</b> at set times during the day. At present, the Carillon is operational and tours are available after concerts. Disputes over funding the completion of the tower were debated before the Naperville City Council during the fall of 2005 (and are still not resolved). The tower's design won an award for [...] "Best Custom Solution" [...] from the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI).|$|E

40|$|To {{consider}} the energy-aware scheduling problem in <b>computer-controlled</b> <b>systems</b> {{is necessary to}} improve the control performance, to use the limited computing resource sufficiently, and to reduce the energy consumption to extend the lifetime of the whole system. In this paper, the scheduling problem of multiple control tasks is discussed based on an adjustable voltage processor. A feedback fuzzy-DVS (dynamic voltage scaling) scheduling architecture is presented by applying technologies of the feedback control and the fuzzy DVS. The simulation results show that, by using the actual utilization as the feedback information to adjust the supply voltage of processor dynamically, the high CPU utilization can be implemented under the precondition of guaranteeing the control performance, whilst the low energy consumption can be achieved as well. The proposed method {{can be applied to}} the design in <b>computer-controlled</b> <b>systems</b> based on an adjustable voltage processor...|$|R
