5|$|Following an {{investigation}} into the 2012 Burgas bus bombing terrorist attack against Israeli citizens in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian government officially accused the Lebanese-militant movement Hezbollah of <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> attack. Five Israeli citizens, the Bulgarian bus driver, and the bomber were killed. The bomb exploded as the Israeli tourists boarded a bus from the airport to their hotel.|$|E
5|$|Keith Jacobson {{was offered}} only two {{opportunities}} to buy child pornography through the mail. Both times, he ordered. Both times, {{he asked for}} opportunities to buy more. He needed no Government agent to coax, threaten, or persuade him; no one played on his sympathies, friendship, or suggested that his <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> crime would further a greater good. In fact, no Government agent even contacted him face to face.|$|E
5|$|As the Union army approached, Lee {{chose to}} make a stand at Sharpsburg, Maryland along Antietam Creek. On September 17, 1862, the armies engaged in the Battle of Antietam. The V Corps was held in reserve {{in the center of}} Union lines during the battle. The 22nd had a clear view of both flanks of the Union army and watched the assaults that took place {{over the course of the}} day. The V Corps, however, took no part in these assaults. Historians have criticized McClellan for his uncoordinated attacks at Antietam and for not <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> V Corps which might have broken Lee's army.|$|E

5|$|In {{front of}} a jury, the city's art censor Jeremiah O'Connor testified that September Morn was lewd {{and should not be}} {{displayed}} in public, but rather only in a museum exhibition. W.W.Hallam of the Chicago Vice Committee agreed, arguing that, as the woman was <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> illegal act of bathing in public, September Morn had to be banned. Other witnesses for the prosecution included censors, educators, and clergy, such as the superintendent Ella Flagg Young {{and the head of the}} Juvenile Protective Association Gertrude Howe Britton.|$|E
5|$|The city of Mumbai's police {{commissioner}} called for censoring of the fast-paced rash driving {{scenes in the}} film due to fears that it would inspire Indian youths to ride their motorcycles rashly, resulting {{in an increase in}} the number of road accidents. Unlike the original, the robberies depicted in Dhoom 2 were not inspired by any real-life crimes. Dhoom 2, however, inspired the robbery of a man by his nephew, who wore clothing similar to Hrithik's in the film while <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> crime.|$|E
5|$|To help counter these effects, in 2012 {{the various}} Chamonix-Mont Blanc {{authorities}} introduced a climate and energy action plan, <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> region to a 22% reduction in its {{greenhouse gas emissions}} by 2020. The plan included proposals to improve air quality by banning those lorries from using the Mont Blanc Tunnel which were deemed {{to be the most}} polluting and which, at times, had reduced air quality to levels more usually associated with the streets of Paris.|$|E
30|$|Data {{from several}} {{measures}} for individuals that did (n =  834) {{and did not}} (n =  219) <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> sunk-cost fallacy are summarized in Table  1. Consistent with previous studies (Bruine de Bruin et al. 2007; Strough et al. 2008, 2011), individuals that <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> sunk-cost fallacy tended to be younger than those that did not. Additionally, they reported being significantly more bothered by emotional problems, and reported waiting longer to seek medical attention when they were feeling ill, than individuals that did not <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> sunk-cost fallacy. Moreover, individuals that <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> sunk-cost fallacy had significantly lower incomes. Examining {{the data from the}} BSI- 18, individuals that <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> sunk-cost fallacy displayed more signs of depression than those that did not. This relation, however, was not observed for somatization, or either of the two anxiety subscales. Similarly, individuals that <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> sunk-cost fallacy scored higher on the Binge Eating Scale than those that did not.|$|R
50|$|In U.S. {{criminal}} law, means, motive, {{and opportunity}} {{is a common}} summation of the three aspects of a crime that must be established before guilt can possibly be determined in a criminal proceeding. Respectively, they refer to: the ability of <b>the</b> defendant to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> crime (means), the reason <b>the</b> defendant <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> crime (motive), and whether the defendant had <b>the</b> chance to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> crime (opportunity). Opportunity is most often disproved by use of an alibi, which can prove the accused {{was not able to}} <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> crime as he or she did not have the correct set of circumstances to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> crime as it occurred. Some crimes are motiveless, however proving motive can often make it easier to convince a jury of the elements that must be proved for a conviction.|$|R

5|$|By 1685 Ville Marie {{was home}} to some 600 colonists, most of them living in modest wooden houses. Ville Marie became a centre for the fur trade and a base for further exploration. In 1689 the English-allied Iroquois {{attacked}} Lachine on the Island of Montreal, <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> worst massacre {{in the history of}} New France. By the early 18th century, the Sulpician Order was established there. To encourage French settlement, they wanted the Mohawk {{to move away from the}} fur trading post at Ville Marie. They had a mission village, known as Kahnewake, south of the St Lawrence River. The fathers persuaded some Mohawk to make a new settlement at their former hunting grounds north of the Ottawa River. This became Kanesatake. In 1745 several Mohawk families moved upriver to create another settlement, known as Akwesasne. All three are now Mohawk reserves in Canada. The Canadian territory was ruled as a French colony until 1760, when it was surrendered to Great Britain after the Seven Years' War.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of their trial she {{remained}} calm, complaining through her lawyers alleged disrespect for the flag while it was being produced as evidence. She loudly protested when the defense suggested that the group might have suffered from mental instability while <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> deed. On June 16, 1954, the jury found all four defendants guilty. On the morning of July 8, 1954, Lebrón learned of her son's death minutes before the sentence was to be announced. She was quiet {{at the beginning of the}} hearing, but at one point, unable to contain herself, she became hysterical. Rover demanded the death penalty, but Holtzoff chose to sentence them to the longest terms of imprisonment possible. In Lebrón's case this was between sixteen and fifty years, depending on her behavior.|$|E
5|$|In Britain gay saunas were {{routinely}} raided by police {{up until the}} end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham, the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine, and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in Manchester). By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges of gross indecency in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as homophobic, and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> homosexual sexual offence of gross indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the Sexual Offences Act 2003.|$|E

50|$|Because {{pleading}} in {{the alternative}} is generally permitted in criminal cases, a defendant may claim to have not <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> crime itself, {{but at the same}} time may claim that if <b>the</b> defendant had <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> crime, the act was excused for a reason such as insanity or intoxication, or was justified due to provocation or self-defense. Such claims are, for obvious reasons, difficult to present to juries, because they entail arguing both that the defendant did and did not <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> crime alleged.|$|R

In Maryland, Henry Dion (Mike Starr) follows a woman home and murders her; he is later visited by a strange man hiding his face behind dark glasses—it becomes apparent {{that this is the}} man who has been sending Black threatening polaroid pictures. Dion thanks the man (Paul Raskin) for finding the victim for him, but is chided for not <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> murder while Black was in the area. Dion takes the corpse into the woods to bury it, all the while speaking to it as though in conversation.|$|E
5|$|Siddhpur, {{historically}} {{known as}} Sristhal. Sidhpur, under {{the rulers of}} Chaulukya dynasty, was a prominent town in the 10th century. In the tenth century (943 AD) Mularaja, {{the founder of the}} Chaulukya dynasty of Gujarat, started the erection of the Rudra Mahalay temple. In his youth, Muladev had slain his maternal uncle, usurped his throne, and murdered the whole of his mother's kindred; and in old age his crimes hung heavily on his mind. He made pilgrimages and courted the favour of Brahmins from far and near. To a band of them he gave Sristhal, and <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> kingdom to his son Chamundaraja, he retired there to end his days in their company (996 AD). But the Rudra Mahalay was still incomplete, nor was it finished till 1140 AD.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of sociobiology to humans (discussed {{only in the}} first and last chapters of the book) was immediately controversial. Some researchers, led by Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, contended that sociobiology embodied biological determinism. They argued that it would be used, as similar ideas had been in the past, to justify the status quo, entrench ruling elites, and legitimize authoritarian political programmes. They referred to social Darwinism and eugenics of the early 20th century, and other more recent developments, such as the IQ controversy of the early 1970s, as cautionary tales in the use of evolutionary principles as applied to human society. They believed that Wilson was <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> naturalistic fallacy, attempting to define moral principles using natural concepts. Academics opposed to Wilson's sociobiology, including Gould, Lewontin, Jon Beckwith, Ruth Hubbard, and Anthony Leeds created the Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the People to counter his ideas.|$|E

5|$|The {{intelligence}} assumes {{control of}} Sandy, {{who has been}} marked {{in the same way}} as Ricky. She stabs Barbra (Victoria Tennant) to death with a pair of scissors, demonstrating superhuman strength while <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> murder, and then mutilates Dean and the remains of Mitch, drinking their blood. The rest of the team seek refuge in the Operations Room as Sandy destroys essential machinery – including the base transmitter – with explosives. When the imbalance in Sandy's mind appears to correct itself, Karl, Sharon and Commander Holly McKay (Jennifer Ashley) attempt to sedate her to spare the unborn children. Sandy's madness returns and Holly and Karl are killed in an accident with heat-sealing apparatus, whereupon Sandy disembowels the corpses.|$|E
5|$|The only clue {{found at}} the scene is a Lucky Boy {{employee}} button. Mulder and Scully check all of the employees and discover {{that one of the}} clerks, Derwood Spinks, is missing his button. Scully suspects Spinks after it is discovered he has a criminal record. Mulder, however, believes that the victim's brain was removed by a proboscis, and suspects another employee, Rob Roberts, of <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> murder. Rob, who is actually a mutant human who wears a disguise to hide his true physical body, subsists on brains in order to survive. When Rob's landlady, Sylvia Jassey, is trailed by a private investigator (Steve Kiziak), Rob kills him and eats in order to placate his hunger, which begins to get more and more uncontrollable.|$|E
5|$|This {{suggestion}} {{stemmed from}} the observation that many engineers relied on {{the basic principles of}} physics and mechanics to guide their work, and yet this often required inventors and engineers to become scientists as well to obtain experimental data—something that they were rarely qualified or resourced to do. Short of government funding of such research, Evans also attempted to create {{in the aftermath of the}} Steam Engineer's Guide what he called 'The Experiment Company', which would be a private research consortium to conduct reliable experiments and gather data for the benefits of subscribed members. The venture failed and Evans could find no paying stockholders to launch it, possibly due to Evans <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> new venture to developing a steam wagon of his own design. The Franklin Institute would be founded in Philadelphia a few years after Evans's death on similar principles.|$|E

5|$|Within debates {{attempting}} {{to decipher the}} conclusion of Candide lies another primary Candide debate. This one concerns {{the degree to which}} Voltaire was advocating a pessimistic philosophy, by which Candide and his companions give up hope for a better world. Critics argue that the group's reclusion on the farm signifies Candide and his companions' loss of hope {{for the rest of the}} human race. This view is to be compared to a reading that presents Voltaire as advocating a melioristic philosophy and a precept <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> travellers to improving the world through metaphorical gardening. This debate, and others, focuses on the question of whether or not Voltaire was prescribing passive retreat from society, or active industrious contribution to it.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this central}} motif are {{arranged}} elements of eight other stories, {{all of them}} represented {{at least in part}} by sets of footprints. Human footprints include a set left by dancing women from a place called Aileron; another shows a family group travelling to a place called Ngama, and a third trail is that of a Tjungurrayi man, which lead to his skeleton, representing his death after <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> crime of trying to steal sacred items. Animal representations include tracks of a cluster of emus from a place called Napperby, on the artist's country, as well as those left by the rock wallaby, or Mala, men journeying north from Port Augusta in South Australia, as well as, on the left hand edge of the picture, those of two groups of dingoes going to a place called Warrabri. A little closer to the centre of the painting are marks representing a dreaming called the Chase of the Goanna Men. Throughout the work, Upambura the Possum Man's footsteps follow the wandering lines that give the painting its overall structure.|$|E
5|$|As Raskolnikov and Porfiry {{continue}} to meet, Raskolnikov's motives {{for the crime}} become exposed. Porfiry becomes increasingly certain of the man's guilt, but has no concrete evidence or witnesses with which to back up this suspicion. Furthermore, another man admits to <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> crime under questioning and arrest. However, Raskolnikov's nerves {{continue to}} wear thinner, and he is constantly struggling {{with the idea of}} confessing, though he knows that he can never be truly convicted. He turns to Sonya for support and confesses his crime to her. By coincidence, Svidrigaïlov has taken up residence in a room next to Sonya's and overhears the entire confession. When the two men meet face to face, Svidrigaïlov acknowledges this fact, and suggests that he may use it against him, should he need to. Svidrigaïlov also speaks of his own past, and Raskolnikov grows to suspect that the rumors about his having committed several murders are true. In a later conversation with Dunya, Svidrigaïlov denies that he had a hand in the death of his wife.|$|E
