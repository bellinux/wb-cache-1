It was supported by Brunel and a large quantity of documentary evidence. Objections from local landowners were handled by including clauses in the Parrett Navigation Act to ensure that surplus water would be channelled to the Long Sutton <b>Catchwater</b> <b>Drain</b> by culverts, siphons, and sluices, and the Act of Parliament was passed on 4 July 1836.|$|E

500|$|Reports on {{improvements}} to the system were produced in 1843 by the surveyor Mr W Lewin and in 1845 by Sir John Rennie. Rennie's scheme involved the provision of a <b>catchwater</b> <b>drain</b> to collect water draining from the higher ground to the west before it entered the fenlands, but an Act of Parliament to authorise its construction was defeated, and so in 1846 a report by Mr W Cubit which proposed {{improvements to}} the existing infrastructure was accepted by the Commissioners. A new Black Sluice, including a [...] wide navigation lock, was constructed {{to the south of}} the original one, with the cill level [...] lower, which enabled the gradient of the South Forty-Foot Drain to be increased to 3inches per mile (5cm/km). Many of the tributary drains were also improved. 1846 also {{marked the beginning of the}} use of steam engines for pumping. Ten years later, a map covering [...] of the Black Sluice area showed nine steam-powered and eight wind-powered drainage engines in use.|$|E

Most of the main drains which are now navigable were excavated or improved as part of this work, including Castle Dyke, Frith Bank Drain, Medlam Drain, Newham Drain and West Fen Drain in the West Fen. In addition to Hobhole Drain, Barlode Drain, Bellwater Drain, Fodder Dyke, Lade Bank Drain and Thorpe Drain were constructed in the East Fen. Hobhole Sluice was opened in 1806 and Rennie's new Maud Foster Sluice was completed in the following year. Under the Acts, the Drainage District was extended to include the East Fen. Although Boston was flooded in 1810, the East and West Fens were declared to be in good order soon afterwards.|$|E

In Hong Kong there are approximately 120 km of concrete channels, used as gutters built along hillsides in order to direct freshwater runoff into reservoirs for local water consumption. These catchwaters can overflow, causing dangerous hazards, erosive streams and blockages.|$|R

His proposals included constructing <b>catchwater</b> <b>drains</b> {{on either side of}} the main channel, enlarging the width and depth of the channel, building two new locks, and rebuilding the road bridge at Brigg. The cost was estimated to be £53,921, of which only 11 per cent was for improvements to navigation. Again, the commissioners were unhappy with the cost, and although Rennie suggested completing the work in stages, he later produced a modified plan which would only cost £25,413.|$|R

The embankment was between 11 and 20 ft high, and was made of sand, covered in turves. The project cost £3,000, and took 200 men with 150 barrows about six months to complete.

2500|$|In 1784, Mill Drain was enlarged, {{with the}} {{intention}} of using it to drain parts of the East Fen, but this action was stopped by Fenmen blocking the drain, as they lived by fishing, fowling and cutting reeds, and these activities were threatened by drainage. A petition was presented to the Commissioners, signed by 105 Fenmen, of whom 86 were sufficiently literate to write their own name. As a result, a sluice was built on Valentine's Drain, which maintained the water level in the East Fen at a height sufficient to allow the Fenmen to continue their way of life. A series of reports had been made during the eighteenth century by the civil engineers John Smeaton, John Grundy, Sr., his son John Grundy, Jr., Langley Edwards, and others, but no action had been taken to implement them. With Sir Joseph Banks of Revesby Abbey pushing for a solution, the civil engineer John Rennie was asked to produce a plan for the drainage of both fens. Anthony Bower and James Murray carried out the surveys, and Rennie produced his report in September 1800. He concluded that the outfalls at Wainfleet and Maud Foster was inadequate, and that the internal drainage of the fens was not effective. He suggested <b>catchwater</b> <b>drains</b> to collect the runoff from the Wolds to prevent it entering the fens, and a new tidal sluice at Hobhole, closer to the Wash than the Maud Foster outlet. After some minor disputes were resolved, the plan formed the basis for an Act of Parliament obtained in 1801.|$|R
50|$|The 1801 Act was {{supplemented}} {{by a second}} Act obtained two years later. The principal engineering works were the West Fen <b>Catchwater</b> <b>Drain,</b> a 13.4 mi channel around {{the northern edge of}} the West Fen; the East Fen <b>Catchwater</b> <b>Drain,</b> a 9.4 mi channel around the northern edge of the East Fen; the Stonebridge Drain, a 4.2 mi channel which connected Cherry Corner to Cowbridge; upgrading of the Maud Foster drain and the provision of a new sluice where it met The Haven; and construction of the Hobhole Drain, running for 13.5 mi from Toynton St Peter to the new Hobhole sluice. Most of the main drains which are now navigable were excavated or improved as part of this work, including Castle Dyke, Frith Bank Drain, Medlam Drain, Newham Drain and West Fen Drain in the West Fen. In addition to Hobhole Drain, Barlode Drain, Bellwater Drain, Fodder Dyke, Lade Bank Drain and Thorpe Drain were constructed in the East Fen. Hobhole Sluice was opened in 1806 and Rennie's new Maud Foster Sluice was completed in the following year. Under the Acts, the Drainage District was extended to include the East Fen.

50|$|In 1988, Aike and Arram Beck were altered, {{removing}} Aike Beck's {{connection to}} the River Hull completely. The waters of Scorborough Beck and Bryan Mills Beck were routed southwards along a <b>catchwater</b> <b>drain,</b> which runs beside the railway line to join Arram Beck. The original course of the navigation was largely filled in, using material from the embankments {{on either side of}} the channel. All that remains is a small section containing water near Beck Lane in Aike, and a slight indentation in the bank of the Hull where Aike Beck used to enter.|$|E
50|$|The {{district}} {{is divided into}} a number of compartments, as it is intersected by embanked rivers which cross the area, carrying water from the Car Dyke, which acts as a <b>catchwater</b> <b>drain</b> at the western boundary, to the Witham on its eastern edge. Most of the parishes were enclosed in the late 1700s, by separate Acts of Parliament, and steam-powered drainage was introduced from the 1830s. Steam engines were gradually replaced by oil and diesel engines, and most have since been superseded by electric pumps. The Witham First District IDB maintains thirteen pumping stations and 165 mi of drainage channels.|$|E
50|$|The commissioners {{gradually}} realised that navigation {{might be}} beneficial, and on 7 April 1778 instructed their engineer, Dunderdale, {{to design a}} wharf for coal and general goods at Bishopbridge, and to construct a lock at Harlam Hill. No progress was made until 20 July 1785, when the commissioners met the proprietors to arrange the purchase of land for the wharf. By this time the engineer {{had been replaced by}} Thomas Bradley. The tolls had been leased to Jonathan and John Goodwin for a period of eleven years from 1781. They paid the commissioners £402 per year, and were expected to make good any damage by tides up to the value of £20, although the commissioners would pay for repairs where the cost exceeded £20. The lease expired on 2 July 1792, when the commissioners took back control, and appointed their own collector of tolls. They noticed a disparity in the tolls for coal, caused by the differing sizes of the wagons at various collieries. The collieries mentioned show that coal was arriving from the River Don Navigation and the Aire and Calder Navigation. During the 1790s, the problems of effective drainage worsened, and the commissioners appointed Isaac Leatham, from Barton near Malton, to produce a comprehensive report with recommendations for the Ancholme Level.

Its purpose is to gather water draining from the higher, sloping ground before it reaches the flat land whence it would be difficult or expensive to remove. The water may be on the surface, in streams or in the ground before it is gathered, perhaps to be led away across the lowland by an embanked river.|$|E
