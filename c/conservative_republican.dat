5|$|On January 6, 2008, Kemp {{endorsed}} McCain in the 2008 Republican presidential primaries {{shortly before}} the New Hampshire primary, which surprised <b>conservative</b> <b>Republican</b> tax cutters.

In addition, Kemp and Phil Gramm advised McCain on economic policy.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislation}} {{in its original}} form {{was sponsored by the}} Democratic Party, but after it ran into opposition, it was rescued by the <b>conservative</b> <b>Republican</b> Senator Barry Goldwater.

5|$|Milk {{abruptly}} {{stopped working}} as an insurance actuary and became {{a researcher at the}} Wall Street firm Bache & Company. He was frequently promoted despite his tendency to offend the older members of the firm by ignoring their advice and flaunting his success. Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk's heart was not in his work. He started a romantic relationship with Jack Galen McKinley, and recruited him to work on <b>conservative</b> <b>Republican</b> Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. Their relationship was troubled. When McKinley first began his relationship with Milk in late 1964, he was 16 years old. He was prone to depression and sometimes threatened to commit suicide if Milk did not show him enough attention. To make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk's ex-lover, Joe Campbell, was himself recuperating from a suicide attempt, after his lover Billy Sipple left him. Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the avant-garde art scene in Greenwich Village, but Milk did not understand why Campbell's despondency was sufficient cause to consider suicide as an option.|$|E
