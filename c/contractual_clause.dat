Palacios lost the election, so Pablo had to remain with Atlético. His agent spoke out in his defence, confirming that Pablo had not asked to leave Atlético, and the Palacios faction were {{taking advantage of a}} <b>contractual</b> <b>clause</b> allowing him to leave if an offer of €15m were received (the club claimed the figure was only a basis for negotiation). He also disingenuously suggested that joining the hated rival was no different from joining a big club abroad.

500|$|Authors {{can still}} {{rely on the}} old common law rights which remain in force; they act as {{alternate}} forms of relief if a claim under dedicated moral rights is dubious, or is seen as unlikely to succeed. Similarly, an author can sometimes rely on contractual rights, as in Frisby v BBC, where the claimant was allowed to block modifications to his work by virtue of a <b>contractual</b> <b>clause</b> prohibiting the BBC from making [...] "structural" [...] changes to his script. Originally these were the only forms of relief for injured authors, although Section 43 of the Copyright Act 1956 created a [...] "tort of misattribution". With the 1988 Act, however, four distinct moral rights were recognised: {{the right to be}} identified as the author (the right of paternity), the right to object to derogatory treatment (the right of integrity), the right to object to false attribution, and the right to privacy in private films and photographs. Because moral rights are personal rights attached to the author, rather than economic rights attached to the work, they cannot be transferred or assigned, but they can be waived.|$|E

During the production O'Hara and Harrison intensely disliked each other from the outset, and she {{found him to be}} [...] "rude, vulgar, and arrogant". Harrison had thought that she disliked him simply because he was British. He reportedly belched in her face during dance sequences and accused her of anti-Semitism, being married to a Jewish woman (Lilli Palmer) at the time, which she vehemently denied. Variety, while acknowledging the length, thought that O'Hara and Harrison carried off their dramatic scenes with [...] "surprising skill". The following year, O'Hara starred opposite Robert Young in the commercially successful comedy film, Sitting Pretty. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised O'Hara and Young as husband and wife, remarking that they were [...] "delightfully clever", acting with [...] "elaborate indignation, alternating with good-natured despair".|$|E

In addition, the station was still enjoying success with local sports programming featuring the Minnesota Twins, {{as well as the}} MSHSL championships. KMSP was stripped of its status as a UPN owned-and-operated station in 2000, after Viacom exercised a <b>contractual</b> <b>clause</b> to buy out Chris-Craft's stake in the network, although the station remained with UPN as an affiliate for another two years.

The first-generation, or [...] "Gen I" [...] car, which would be powered by lead-acid batteries and had a stated range of 70 to 100 miles; 660 cars, painted dark green, red, and silver were produced. The cars were made available via a leasing program, with the option to purchase the cars specifically disallowed by a <b>contractual</b> <b>clause</b> (the suggested retail price was quoted as $34,000). In similar fashion to the PrEView program, lessees were pre-screened by GM, with only residents of Southern California and Arizona eligible for participation. Leasing rates for the EV1 ranged from $399 to $549 a month. The car's launch was a media event, accompanied by an $8 million promotional campaign, which included prime-time TV advertising, billboards, a web site, and an appearance at the premiere of the Sylvester Stallone film Daylight. The first lessees included celebrities, executives and politicians. A total of 40 EV1 leases were signed at the release event, with GM estimating that it would lease 100 cars {{by the end of the}} year. Deliveries began on December 5, 1996.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – It {{analyzes}} to {{what extent}} the intervention of the controlling shareholder and its inherent provisions in power distribution utilities contracts are validated in the light of reflexive law constructs.

It proceeds with the normative selection, tabulation and comparison of the <b>contractual</b> <b>clauses</b> related to the controlling shareholder, constant in the contracts of the ten most prominent power distribution utilities with the largest number of consumers and power distribution in 2013.

40|$|The {{capitalist}} {{financial market}} {{is governed by}} terms and conditions imposed by large banking corporations and institutions. In creditor-debtor relations, the creditor (lender, lessor) is in a dominant economic and legal position {{at the moment of}} entering into a credit agreement, which enables him to impose different terms and conditions upon the debtor (borrower, lessee) and introduce unfair <b>contractual</b> <b>clauses.</b> Therefore, the legislator and government institutions have to protect debtors (consumers) as credit beneficiaries from such credit terms and conditions that unfairly aggravate the debtors legal position. In this article, the author analyzes the legal position of subjects of credit relations, with particular reference to the legislative provisions governing the protection of the debtor (consumer) as an economically and legally dependant contracting party. Apart from being significantly affected by financial market reforms and changes in the mortgage legislation, the legal position of debtors (consumers) has been additionally aggravated in Serbian legislation in the past decade. After discussing the creditor-debtor relations, the author focuses on the issue of establishing a balance of interests; the balance of the creditor and the debtor interests may be achieved by enabling the creditor to keep the financial incentive (earnings form the interest rate) and obliging the debtor (credit-user) to provide legal certainty and protection against unfair <b>contractual</b> <b>clauses...</b>|$|R
