40|$|To {{validate}} {{the design process}} and {{ensure the safety of}} an important structure with sliding supports, a finite element-based force identification technique and a strain measurement point selection procedure have been presented in part I of this paper. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed force identification technique and measurement point selection procedure are now verified in part II of this paper through numerical investigations on a steel plate support structure. The relationship between the orthogonal property of the selected measurement points and the condition number of the identification equation and the effectiveness of the sequential orthogonal searching algorithm are examined through Monte Carlo simulation. Two cases on force identification of the steel plate structure are then presented: one case concerns <b>concentrated</b> <b>sliding</b> force acting either at node or inside grid, and the other case pertains uniformly distributed sliding load covering a fixed area. For both cases, the strain measurement points of fairly good orthogonal property are firstly determined using the proposed measurement point selection procedure. The positions and magnitudes of initial and final forces are then identified using the proposed force identification technique with or without measurement noise included. The identification results obtained from both cases show that the proposed force identification method can effectively locate and identify the <b>concentrated</b> <b>sliding</b> force and the uniformly distributed sliding load covering a fixed area with no information required on the initial position and magnitude of the sliding force. It is also illustrated that the increase of the number of measurement points can improve the accuracy of identification results. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Sliding {{supports}} {{are widely}} used in bridges, space structures, and power plants to avoid potential damages to the structure due to expansion and contraction effects caused by temperature changes. To {{ensure the safety of}} an important structure with sliding supports, it is desirable to know both the magnitudes and positions of sliding forces through strain measurements. Effective and practical identification of sliding forces based on strain measurements on site is therefore explored in this paper. The problems involved in the force identification of sliding support systems are described. The finite element-based force identification technique and the strain measurement point selection procedure are then presented for the identification of sliding forces with no information required on their initial positions and magnitudes. The minimum strain measurement points with fairly good orthogonal property are targeted in the selection procedure. The quadratic programming problem with linear constraints and in some case the nonlinear least-squares method are involved in the identification of either <b>concentrated</b> <b>sliding</b> forces or uniformly distributed sliding loads. The feasibility and accuracy of the force identification technique and the strain measurement point selection procedure proposed in Part I of this paper will be demonstrated in Part II of this paper through numerical examples.

40|$|Direct smear {{microscopy}} of sputum {{forms the}} mainstay of TB diagnosis in resource-limited settings. Stained sputum smear slides {{can serve as a}} ready-made resource to transport sputum for molecular drug susceptibility testing. However, bio-safety is a major concern during transport of sputum/stained slides and for laboratory workers engaged in processing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected sputum specimens. In this study, a bio-safe USP (Universal Sample Processing) concentration-based sputum processing method (Bio-safe method) was assessed on 87 M. tuberculosis culture positive sputum samples. Samples were processed for Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear, liquid culture and DNA isolation. DNA isolated directly from sputum was subjected to an IS 6110 PCR assay. Both sputum DNA and DNA extracted from bio-safe ZN <b>concentrated</b> smear <b>slides</b> were subjected to rpoB PCR and simultaneously assessed by DNA sequencing for determining rifampin (RIF) resistance. All sputum samples were rendered sterile by Bio-safe method. Bio-safe smears exhibited a 5 % increment in positivity over direct smear with a 14 % increment in smear grade status. All samples were positive for IS 6110 and rpoB PCR. Thirty four percent samples were RIF resistant by rpoB PCR product sequencing. A 100 % concordance (Îº value = 1) was obtained between sequencing results derived from bio-safe smear slides and bio-safe sputum. This study demonstrates that Bio-safe method can address safety issues associated with sputum processing, provide an efficient alternative to sample transport in the form of bio-safe stained <b>concentrated</b> smear <b>slides</b> and can also provide information on drug (RIF) resistance by direct DNA sequencing...|$|R

40|$|Optical {{interferometry}} is used {{to measure}} the elastohydrodynamic (EHD) film thickness associated with artificially produced nonsmooth surfaces. The nonsmooth surfaces are produced by modifying the surfaces of highly-polished balls with irregularities in the form of multiple grooves and dents. By closely spacing these irregularities it is possible not only to produce depressions {{on the surface of the}} balls but also to generate pseudo asperities. The average roughness wavelength of this artificially-produced, nonsmooth, surface approximates the average fundamental roughness wavelength found on surfaces of some mechanical elements operating under concentrated contact. By comparing the measured film thickness profiles to the stylus traces of the irregularities, it was possible to observe the local deformations associated with micro-EHD pressure generation. In both pure rolling and pure sliding conditions the artificially-produced asperities are deformed and complete separation exists between them and the mating surface. Such findings demonstrate the importance of local surface topography and resulting micro-EHD effects on the film thickness between rough surfaces in <b>concentrated</b> contact. <b>Sliding</b> data are presented which demonstrate a severe constriction, caused by the irregularities, at the exit of the Hertzian region...|$|R
40|$|Many {{components}} of future aircraft will be constructed from novel high-temperature materials, such as superalloys and ceramic composites, to meet expected operating temperatures {{in excess of}} 300 C. There are no known liquid lubricants that can lubricate above 300 C without significant decomposition. Solid lubricants could be considered, but problems caused by the higher friction coefficients and wear rates of the solid lubricant film make this an undesirable approach. An alternative method of lubrication is currently being investigated: vapor phase lubrication. In vapor phase lubrication, an organic liquid (in our studies a thioether was used) is vaporized into a flowing air stream that is directed to sliding surfaces where lubrication is needed. The organic vapor reacts at the <b>concentrated</b> contact <b>sliding</b> area generating a lubricous deposit. This deposit has been characterized as a thin polymeric film that can provide effective lubrication at temperatures greater than 400 C. Initial tribological studies were conducted at the NASA Lewis Research Center and Cleveland State University with a high-temperature friction and wear tribometer. A cast iron rod was loaded (a 4 -kg mass was used to generate a contact pressure of 1. 2 MPa) against a reciprocating, cast iron plate at 500 C. This system was then lubricated with the vapor phase of thioether...|$|R
30|$|The furrows on top {{or most of}} the {{landslides}} in VM {{are much}} similar to those found on terrestrial rock avalanches falling onto glaciers (Lucchitta 1987; Shreve 1966; McSaveney 1978). As the rock avalanche follows the local gradient and opens up in a fan, single parts may tear apart in linear zones which materialize as the longitudinal furrows when the landslide fully develops. Furrows thus require a soft and slippery basal layer for their formation and small friction (Lucchitta 1987; De Blasio 2011 a) that makes the role of inertia dominant (Dufresne and Davies 2009). Our suggested situation is thus that landslides were lubricated by ice of a partly glaciated VM (Lucchitta 1987). In this respect, two possible scenarios can be suggested. In the first scenario, ice impregnates the pores of the subsurface regolith. Upon collapse of the rock mass, intense frictional heat <b>concentrated</b> at the <b>sliding</b> base leads internal ice to melting. The resulting water may lubricate the landslide not only reducing the effective friction, but also because wetted fines mixed with water work as a layer of non-Newtonian fluid (De Blasio 2009).|$|R
30|$|Numerous {{fretting}} damages {{exist at}} {{various parts of}} nuclear power systems [7], such as reactor fuel assembly, control rod assembly [8], reactor component, steam generator, pressure vessel [9], main pump, and coolant pump. The steam generator is a key equipment in nuclear power systems, and fretting damage {{is one of the}} main reasons [10] causing its failure. With high thermal strength, good corrosion resistance, anti-oxidation, and other characteristics, alloy 690 is extensively used in the nuclear power and aerospace fields. In nuclear power plants, U-tubes in the steam generator are supported by structures called egg crates. Flow-induced vibration of the U-tubes causes wear to occur on the zone of contact and generates combinations of impacting and sliding motions between the U-tube against the support [11 â 14]. Recently, most of the domestic and foreign studies on wear have <b>concentrated</b> on the <b>sliding</b> wear or bending behavior of the steam generator tubes. In another study, bending (four-point or three-point bending) has been used to determine the damage behavior of tubes or rods [15]. Gueout, et al [16] report that wear of pure sliding is larger than impact wear in the case of anti-vibration bar testing. In particular, the wear amount of impact sliding increase more than that of pure sliding or impact wear test. Jeong, et al [17], indicate that the friction coefficient in air is higher than that in water. The friction coefficient and wear rate increased as the temperature of water increase in the water environment. Chung, et al [18], conclude that the wear coefficient in ambient room temperature is lower than 80 Â Â°C in water conditions and explain that the protective nature of the tribologically transformed layers could decrease the wear volume. Most of study focus on the tangential fretting wear of alloy 690 tubes, and research on impact fretting wear of alloy 690 tubes is limited. The impact fretting wear behavior of alloy 690 is significant in the evaluation of the life of steam generator tubes in nuclear power plants and in better understanding the wear mechanisms of steam generator tube materials.|$|R
40|$|Friction-induced {{vibrations}} may {{in certain}} conditions cause squeal noise to occur. Squeal may be generated in partly wet glass-run window systems {{due to the}} friction between the seal surface and the window. Squeal noise causes annoyance and conveys a subjective impression of poor vehicle quality. ^ The transient vibrations and sound featured an increase in amplitude with high fundamental frequency in the experiment of a seal sample and a moving glass panel. Multiple harmonics of the fundamental frequency and frequency jumps were observed in vibration frequency spectra. The frequency decreased as the amplitude of the vibration increased, which is characteristic of stick-slip oscillations. The vibrations occurred {{when there was a}} large decrease of the friction force during a surge in speed. ^ An approximate expression for the frequency of the stick-slip oscillations was obtained in a single-degree of freedom model. The model indicated that the frequency decreased as the normal force and the difference between the static and kinetic friction coefficients were increased. ^ The seal was idealized as a continuous one-dimensional rod, and the glass was represented as a <b>sliding,</b> <b>concentrated</b> contact force. The system became unstable when the magnitude of the normal force and the magnitude of the negative slope in the friction law were large. Harmonics of the fundamental frequency were observed in spectrograms of the responses. The frequency was shifted between modal frequencies because of modal amplitude variations with the position of the contact force. ^ Stick-slip oscillations were simulated in a finite element model using an explicit time marching method. Slipping occurred locally in regions of the seal surface where the elastic force overcame the static friction force. The stick-slip phenomenon was found to propagate between the speeds of dilatational and transverse waves. The motion of the seal at the slipping phase was in the direction of friction force. The peak frequency was found to vary according to the glass position on the seal surface. It was suggested that both periods of stick motion and slip motion should be considered in order to estimate the frequency of the stick-slip oscillations. ...|$|R
40|$|Wear is {{considered}} one of the main challenges in the twenty-first century for engineers and designers of mechanical systems. The objective is to understand the wear mechanisms and to seek new solutions - materials, lubricants, additives - to extend the lifetime of components, enable scheduled maintenance and replacement intervals. Research conducted during the past decades shows that wear can be minimized but not eliminated from systems operation due to a large number of parameters which are influencing the evolution of this phenomenon: load, velocity, temperature, type of lubrication as well as the surface roughness. Depending on operation conditions, the occurrence of wear leads to a change in the macro contact geometry of the components. In time, this will affect the functioning of the components, for example: high friction for brakes, clutches and transmissions or low friction for cylinder-piston contact, cam-follower and gears. In this thesis the influence of macroscopic wear on friction in lubricated <b>sliding</b> <b>concentrated</b> contacts is investigated. Experimental wear and friction tests were conducted on different types of lubricated contacts: line, point and elliptical. These tests have shown a change in contact geometry and in operating regime of the systems, i. e. friction level. To understand this, a relation between wear, contact geometry and minimum film thickness is made. In a lubricated contact three zones are distinguished: inlet, contact and outlet zone. The inlet zone dictates the formation of the minimum film thickness between contacting surfaces. When wear is present the contact geometry changes, leading to a modification in pressure distribution. Changes in separation due to wear are modeled based on hydrodynamic theory and are incorporated in a deterministic mixed lubrication friction model. Using this model the transition between the lubrication regimes, as shown in a Stribeck curve, can be predicted. The experimentally obtained results are in agreement with the theoretical simulations. It is shown that increased wear leads to a decreased friction level resulting from the occurrence of the hydrodynamic effects due to a reduced contact pressure. This causes a change in the operating regime of the system. In the one case this changed regime can be considered to be the main cause of failure in a system, whereas in another system it means smooth operation after a period of running-in. The theoretical results are presented in a generalized Stribeck curve. From this, it is possible to select the parameters such that the components of a lubricated system operate in the preferred regime in order to control friction and minimize wear...|$|R
