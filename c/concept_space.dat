40|$|Current {{publication}} sharing systems {{inherit from}} the Web 2. 0 philosophy {{the idea that}} users can add reusable information to support other peers, enabling them to insert new resources and to tag the existing ones; but, in their current form, these systems suffer of some limitations, such as the lack of tools for supporting users during the creation and organization of their personal <b>concept</b> <b>spaces,</b> and the poor utilization of tags as information sources for producing personalized recommendations. In this {{paper we propose a}} model for organizing dynamic and customizable <b>concept</b> <b>spaces,</b> based on innovative structures, and we introduce a mechanism for recommendation, based on tags and mainly on the way in which users connect resources in their <b>concept</b> <b>spaces.</b> Adaptive recommendations are generated analyzing the users' <b>concept</b> <b>spaces,</b> and evaluating the similarities among them in order to reveal the similarity among their goals and perspectives...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{spin-offs}} of calculating document {{statistics in}} the concept domain, rather than the word domain, is that concepts form natural tree structures based on hypernymy and meronymy.

40|$|AbstractBased on the {{observation}} that the category of <b>concept</b> <b>spaces</b> with the positive information topology {{is equivalent to the}} category of countably based T 0 topological spaces, we investigate further connections between the learning in the limit model of inductive inference and topology. In particular, we show that the “texts” or “positive presentations” of concepts in inductive inference can be viewed as special cases of the “admissible representations” of computable analysis. We also show that several structural properties of <b>concept</b> <b>spaces</b> have well known topological equivalents. In addition to topological methods, we use algebraic closure operators to analyze the structure of <b>concept</b> <b>spaces,</b> and we show the connection between these two approaches. The goal of this paper is not only to introduce new perspectives to learning theorists, but also to present the field of inductive inference in a way more accessible to domain theorists and topologists...|$|R

In computer games, playing a space marine in action games was popularized by id Software's Doom series, first published in 1993. It is a convenient game back-story as it excuses the presence of the character on a hostile alien world with little support and heavy weaponry. Some critics have suggested it has been overused to the point of being an action game cliché.|$|E

There was a big 20ft wall with supplies and it was a non-stop changing graffiti wall.

The gallery displayed design collections within the same space as classic ‘pop art’ pieces from artists such as Allen Jones and Bridget Riley. Early collaborators, clients and admirers of Squire were Alexander Mcqueen (who wore Squire designs to his first historic Givenchy interview), Massive Attack, Kate Moss, Helmut Lang and most of the iconoclasts of design, music and style scenes.

Under Semple's directorship the gallery's primary focus has been to provide a platform for a new generation of international artists and curators. It has also expanded to include off-site projects, for example with Miriam Elia's exhibition [...] "I fell in love with a conceptual artist" [...] at the Nave Church, international exhibition initiatives and a publishing arm. Since 2010 the program has showcased the works of Tom Ormond, Piers Secunda, The Girls, Alana Lake, Alex Bunn, Sarah Maple, Adham Faramawy, James Howard, NERO and Yasam Sasmazer amongst others. The 7500 sq ft. <b>concept</b> <b>space</b> also includes The Aubin Cinema which is run in collaboration with the members' club Shoreditch House and is a new social hot spot in East London’s Redchurch Street.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{investigation}} of the mechanism {{of the emergence of}} a creative idea is the most important challenge in design research. It is said that a creative idea is a synthesis of various concepts. Such a conceptual synthesis has the possibility of affecting the <b>concept</b> <b>space.</b> It is said that the transformation of <b>concept</b> <b>space</b> is associated with creativity. There are many studies that focus on <b>concept</b> <b>space.</b> These studies explored the influence of the structure of <b>concept</b> <b>space</b> on the design process. In contrast, there is no research on the effect of design processes that affect the structure of <b>concept</b> <b>space.</b> In this paper, we discuss the relationship between conceptual synthesis and the transformation of <b>concept</b> <b>space.</b> To inspect the relationship, we proposed hypotheses and performed a design experiment. In this experiment, three subjects were asked to create design by synthesizing two concepts: bird and glass. The subjects were also asked to perform a test of investigating the distance between concepts before and after the design experiment. The test enabled us to investigate the difference of <b>concept</b> <b>space</b> before and after the design experiment. The results of the test were analyzed by the multidimensional scaling (MDS) method. From the results of the experiment, we concluded that distances from bird did not change, but those from “glass ” changed. That is, restructuring of <b>concept</b> <b>space</b> occurred from the viewpoint of “glass ” but not from the viewpoint of “bird”. Given this, changing <b>concept</b> <b>space</b> during the design process is captured and the creativity of a design can be associated with the degree of changing of <b>concept</b> <b>space.</b> In this study, we pointed out the possibility of the influence of the design process on the <b>concept</b> <b>space...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>Concept</b> <b>Space</b> or Domain Ontology is an {{important}} part of an adaptive eLearning course. Understanding the structure of a <b>concept</b> <b>space</b> from a traditional concept map is not, however, al-ways straightforward. Hyperbolic trees are one alternative representation which can allow easier comprehension. 1 Traditional <b>Concept</b> <b>Space</b> Visualisation Methods A fundamental part of an Adaptive eLearning system is the <b>Concept</b> <b>Space</b> or Domain Ontology. This provides a conceptual model of the subject matter being studied and allows a pedagogy and adaptivity to be constructed around it. Concept Spaces may be encoded in various formats (commonly XML using a standard such as OWL[9]). Traditionally, however, they have been visualised using a concept map diagram, a downward-branching, heirarchical tree structure. See Figure 1 for XML and tree representation of the same simple map.
