25|$|Cost–benefit {{analysis}} {{is often used}} by organizations to appraise the desirability of a given policy. It is {{an analysis of the}} expected balance of benefits and costs, including an account of foregone alternatives and the status quo. CBA helps predict whether the benefits of a policy outweigh its costs, and by how much relative to other alternatives, so that one can rank alternate policies in terms of the <b>cost–benefit</b> <b>ratio.</b> Generally, accurate cost–benefit analysis identifies choices that increase welfare from a utilitarian perspective. Assuming an accurate CBA, changing the status quo by implementing the alternative with the lowest <b>cost–benefit</b> <b>ratio</b> can improve Pareto efficiency. While CBA can offer a well-educated estimate of the best alternative – perfect appraisal of all present and future costs and benefits is difficult –, perfection in terms of economic efficiency and social welfare are not guaranteed.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1997 {{study of}} the <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>ratio</b> of {{earthquake}} prediction research in Greece, Stathis Stiros suggested that even a (hypothetical) excellent prediction method would be of questionable social utility, because [...] "organized evacuation of urban centers {{is unlikely to be}} successfully accomplished", while [...] "panic and other undesirable side-effects can also be anticipated." [...] He found that earthquakes kill less than ten people per year in Greece (on average), and that most of those fatalities occurred in large buildings with identifiable structural issues. Therefore, Stiros stated that it would be much more cost-effective to focus efforts on identifying and upgrading unsafe buildings. Since the death toll on Greek highways is more than 2300 per year on average, he argued that more lives would also be saved if Greece's entire budget for earthquake prediction had been used for street and highway safety instead.|$|E

As both types of patrollers return, foragers assess their rates of return to decide whether to leave the nest to find food.

40|$|Iran {{is located}} in a highly seismic active region, and {{building}} structures, therefore, need to be designed and constructed to withstand major earthquakes. Structural mitigation measures are now seen as one key element to reduce economic as well as human losses for today and in the future. However, {{the costs and benefits of}} various options are difficult to be assessed and usually done without considering both human and economic aspects. This paper should fill part of this gap and performs an in-depth earthquake risk analysis for Shiraz city, in Iran. Additionally, the effects of different mitigation measures for buildings and corresponding changes in risk levels have been investigated. Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis is used to prepare the hazard curves, to be used in the probabilistic cost-benefit analysis of buildings to investigate the effects of using different strengthening strategies. Regarding the importance of the assessment of human casualties during earthquakes, additional <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>ratios</b> were calculated by considering the value of statistical life and performing sensitivity analysis. The results show that considering the value of statistical life in cost-benefit analysis can significantly increase the structural <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>ratios.</b> This has impotant implications for the decision support as well as policy making side in Iran, and we conclude with suggestions how these issues could be addressed in the future using a risk-layering approach...|$|R
2500|$|Levels of sociality {{across the}} class Insecta range from eusocial species (with {{cooperative}} brood care, overlapping generations within {{a colony of}} adults and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive castes) to solitary living, with many intermediate systems in between which despite lacking full eusociality still may exhibit parental care or nest cohabitation. Different systems of social organization alter both the possibility and <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>ratio</b> of social immune mechanisms (e.g. guarding {{the entrance to the}} nest requires both division of labour, whilst allogrooming merely requires behavioural interactions), though the absence of many behaviours currently only recorded in eusocial taxa from non-eusocial taxa may simply be {{due to a lack of}} study of these group's social immune systems. For instance it seems plausible that insects living in common nest sites could evolve to remove conspecific corpses from the nest or to isolate an infected group member - and yet these behaviours (and many more) have only been recorded in eusocial species. Alternatively it may be the case that whilst the three conditions of eusociality themselves are not prerequisites for the emergence of these behaviours, [...] secondary consequences of eusociality are. Perhaps the large number of individuals in eusocial colonies increases the efficiency of collective anti-parasite defences and thus their emergence begins to be selected for; or perhaps the preponderance of non-reproductive individuals is a necessary driver for the evolution of these behaviours, as when in a colony attacked by a parasite they can only increase their indirect fitness via social immunity directed at the queen's brood.|$|E
2500|$|Velvet worms are ambush predators, hunting only by night, and {{are able}} to capture animals at least their own size, {{although}} it may take almost all of their slime-secreting capacity to capture a large prey item. They feed on almost any small invertebrates, including woodlice (Isopoda), termites (Isoptera), crickets (Gryllidae), book/bark lice (Psocoptera), cockroaches (Blattidae), millipedes and centipedes (Myriapoda), spiders (Araneae), various worms, and even large snails (Gastropoda). Depending on their size, they eat on average every one to four weeks. They are considered to be ecologically equivalent to centipedes (Chilopoda). The most energetically favourable prey are two-fifths the size of the hunting onychophoran. Ninety percent of the time involved in eating prey is spent ingesting it; re-ingestion of the slime used to trap the insect is performed while the onychophoran locates a suitable place to puncture the prey, and this phase accounts for around 8% of the feeding time, with the remaining time evenly split between examining, squirting, and injecting the prey. [...] In some cases, chunks of the prey item are bitten off and swallowed; undigestable components take around 18 hours to pass through the digestive tract. Onychophora probably do not primarily use vision to detect their prey; although their tiny eyes do have a good image-forming capacity, their forward vision is obscured by their antennae; their nocturnal habit also limits the utility of eyesight. Air currents, formed by prey motion, are thought to be the primary mode of locating prey; the role of scent, if any, is unclear. Because it takes so long to ingest a prey item, hunting mainly happens around dusk; the onychophorans will abandon their prey at sunrise. This predatory way of life is probably a consequence of the velvet worm's need to remain moist. Due to the continual risk of desiccation, often only a few hours per day are available for finding food. This leads to a strong selection for a low <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>ratio,</b> which cannot be achieved with a herbivorous diet.|$|E
