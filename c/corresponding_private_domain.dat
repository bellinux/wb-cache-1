5000|$|A {{large portion}} of this tractate deals with the melachah of {{transferring}} from one domain to another, commonly called [...] "carrying" [...] (chapters 1 and 11). The tractate distinguishes four domains: private, public, semi-public and an exempt area. It holds that the transfer of an article from a private to a public domain is Biblically forbidden; transferring an article between a semi-public to a <b>private</b> or public <b>domain</b> is Rabbinically prohibited; transferring of an article between an exempt area and any other domain is permissible; carrying an article four amos may be forbidden in public or semi-public domain and permitted in a <b>private</b> <b>domain</b> or exempt area; and carrying inside a <b>private</b> <b>domain</b> or between <b>private</b> <b>domains</b> may be permissible (see Eruv). For these purposes [...] "transferring" [...] means [...] "removing and depositing", so that carrying an article out of a domain and returning to the same domain with it does not constitute transferring. This may fall {{into the category of}} [...] "wearing".|$|R

A trusted third party, called the Private Key Generator (PKG), generates the <b>corresponding</b> <b>private</b> keys.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} investigated {{effects of}} perceived ingroup acculturation norms. Majority members {{read an article}} about their peers having specific acculturation preferences for minority members in public and <b>private</b> <b>domains,</b> which was the experimental manipulation. Dependent variables were liking for ingroup members, majority members’ own preference for culture maintenance relative to their preference for culture adoption for public and <b>private</b> <b>domains,</b> and their investment in cultural maintenance relative to their investment {{in contact with the}} minority. In England (N = 237) we focused on attitudes towards Muslims, while in Chile (N = 291) the focus was on attitudes towards the indigenous Mapuche. Results reflect the political climates of the two countries: Chileans showed more reactance against their peers demanding assimilation from minority members than English people did – by increasing their preference for maintenance relative to adoption. Yet, in both countries, peers who demanded assimilation were liked the least. In England, responses on public acculturation preferences and acculturative investment were the same, whereas they differed in Chile. Overall, Chileans valued culture maintenance of Mapuche more than culture adoption for both public and <b>private</b> <b>domains.</b> For English people however, this was only the case for the <b>private</b> <b>domain,</b> while for the public domain they had opposite overall preferences. Finally, regardless of country, the more people preferred culture maintenance relative to adoption in the public domain, the higher their support for multiculturalism was too, highlighting the importance of investigating relative acculturation preference...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Satisfaction {{with life}} domains is more highly {{correlated}} with interpersonal than with intrapersonal comparisons (Emmons and Diener, 1985). The hypothesis of the present studies is that the high correlations reflect inferences of social comparison from global satisfaction. Paradoxically, such inferences are most likely in <b>private</b> <b>domains</b> (love life, friends), where social information is scarce and relatively unimportant as a determinant of satisfaction. Study I replicates the Emmons-Diener findings, but also finds that subjects judge recent changes more important than social standing as a determinant of life satisfaction, especially in <b>private</b> <b>domains.</b> Study 1 I examines an order effect in judgments of satisfaction. As hypothesized the correlation between social comparison and global satisfaction is higher (in <b>private</b> <b>domains</b> only) when global satisfaction is judged first than when the order of judgment is reversed. The main goal {{of the study of}} subjective well-being is to understand the causes of human happiness and misery. This goal has often been sought through the correlational analysis of people's evaluations of various aspects of their lives. The correlational analysis accepts the ratings o...|$|R
