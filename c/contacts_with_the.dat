5|$|In {{his foreign}} policy, Prime Minister Tătărescu {{balanced}} two different priorities, attempting {{to strengthen the}} traditional military alliance with Poland which was aimed at the Soviet Union, and reacting against the growing regional influence of Nazi Germany by maintaining the relevancy of the Little Entente and establishing further <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Soviets.|$|E
5|$|Biblical and extrabiblical {{evidence}} suggests that of the Arabian tribes, the Qedarites were most prominent in their <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> world outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Like other nomadic groups, they lived primarily in unfortified encampments. Pastoralists and traders in livestock, such as male lambs, rams and goats, they also {{played a key role}} in the prosperity of Gaza's incense trade, controlling traffic in the desert regions between Egypt and Palestine. As a result of their trading activities, there were clans from among the Qedarites that became wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Lund Cathedral in Scania {{started in}} about 1103 when {{the region was}} part of the Kingdom of Denmark. It was the first of great Danish Romanesque cathedrals {{in the shape of a}} three-aisled {{basilica}} with transepts. It seems to have been related to earlier German buildings, though there are also traces of Anglo-Norman and Lombard influences. Ribe, which followed with its great cathedral (1150–1250), had close trade <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Rhine region of Germany. Both the materials, sandstone and tufa, and the models were taken from there.|$|E

40|$|An {{electrochemical}} device, {{such as a}} {{fuel cell}} or an electrolyzer. In one embodiment, the electrochemical device includes a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), an anodic gas diffusion medium in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> anode of the MEA, a cathodic gas diffusion medium in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cathode, a first bipolar plate in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> anodic gas diffusion medium, and a second bipolar plate in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cathodic gas diffusion medium. Each of the bipolar plates includes an electrically-conductive, non-porous, liquid-permeable, substantially gas-impermeable membrane in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> its respective gas diffusion medium, the membrane including a solid polymer electrolyte and a non-particulate, electrically-conductive material, such as carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and/or metal nanowires. In addition, each bipolar plate also includes an electrically-conductive fluid chamber in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> electrically-conductive, selectively-permeable membrane and further includes a non-porous and electrically-conductive plate in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fluid chamber...|$|R
5|$|During this period, the Mycenaean centers {{witnessed}} increased <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{outside world}} and {{especially with the}} Cyclades and the Minoan centers in the island of Crete. Mycenaean presence appears to be also depicted in a fresco at Akrotiri, on Thera island, which possibly displays many warriors in Boar's tusk helmets, a feature typical of Mycenaean warfare. In the early 15th century, commerce intensified with Mycenaean pottery reaching the western coast of Asia Minor, including Miletus and Troy, Cyprus, Lebanon, Palestine and Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Marcinkus was posthumously {{mentioned}} in despatches in the 1944 King's Birthday Honours, he also received the 1939–45 Star, the Air Crew Europe Star, and the War Medal 1939–1945. British authorities attempted to contact his relatives in Lithuania, but Lithuania—as a Soviet Socialist Republic— {{was behind the}} Iron Curtain, and they were advised to stop these attempts since his relatives might suffer negative consequences. At the time Soviet authorities saw those people who maintained <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> West as untrustworthy.|$|E
5|$|Valero was {{captured}} by a Spanish pirate, who turned {{him over to the}} Spanish authorities in Cuba. Valero was imprisoned but managed to escape {{with the help of a}} group of men that identified with Simón Bolívar's ideals. Upon learning of Bolívar's dream of creating a unified Latin America, including Puerto Rico and Cuba, Valero decided to join him. Valero stopped in St. Thomas, where he established <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Puerto Rican independence movement.|$|E

5|$|A Chera coin {{with the}} {{portrait}} of a king wearing a Roman helmet was discovered from Karur. The obverse side of the silver coin has {{the portrait of}} a king, facing left, wearing a Roman-type bristled-crown helmet. This coin maybelong to the 1st century BC and may be earlier to Makkotai and Kuttuvan Kotai coins. With a flat nose and protruding lips, he has a wide and thick ear lobe but wears no ear-ring. The person depicted appears to be elderly. Unlike other Chera silver portrait coins, the king's portrait on this coin faces left. The coin points to Romans having had trade <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Chera kings and establishes that the Roman soldiers had landed in the Chera country to give protection to the Roman traders who had come there to buy materials.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Theobald III, Count of Champagne, the {{leadership}} of the Crusade passed to Boniface of Montferrat, a friend of the Hohenstaufen Philip of Swabia. Both Boniface and Philip had married into the Byzantine Imperial family. In fact, Philip's brother-in-law, Alexios Angelos, son of the deposed and blinded Emperor Isaac II Angelos, had appeared in Europe seeking aid and had made <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> crusaders. Alexios offered to reunite the Byzantine church with Rome, pay the crusaders 200,000 silver marks, join the crusade and provide all the supplies they needed to get to Egypt. Innocent was aware of a plan to divert the Crusade to Constantinople and forbade any attack on the city, but the papal letter arrived after the fleets had left Zara.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the rapid}} {{collapse}} of the KPA, China's Chairman Mao Zedong ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to be reorganized into the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) for the upcoming intervention in Korea. Despite Mao's determination to save North Korea from capitulation, the Chinese military leadership expressed doubts {{on the ability of}} the Chinese army to fight against the more modernized US forces. As a compromise, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead building operation with limited offensives against only the South Korean forces while avoiding <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> US forces. Under strict secrecy, the PVA entered Korea on 19 October.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 16thcentury, the town became an important trading port. The town took advantage of its east coast location, which facilitated trading <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Low Countries, the Baltic region, England, and Northern France. The feu-ferme charter of 1451 between the Abbot of Dunfermline and the burgesses of Kirkcaldy mentioned a small but functioning harbour; it is not known when this harbour was established, or whether it was always located {{at the mouth of the}} East Burn. According to treasurers' accounts of the early 16thcentury, timber imported via the harbour—possibly from the Baltic countries—was used at Falkland Palace and Edinburgh Castle, as well as in shipbuilding. Raw materials such as hides, wool, skins, herring, salmon, coal and salt were exported from the town until well into the 17thcentury.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1942, over 1,000 {{children}} {{that had been}} rounded up during the Kozara Offensive were being held at the Stara Gradiška concentration camp, itself a sub-camp of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex. Information {{about the plight of}} these children was passed to concerned citizens in the NDH capital, Zagreb, one of whom was Diana Budisavljević, an Austrian. Budisavljević approached an Ustaše-appointed {{member of the board of}} the Croatian Red Cross, Kamilo Brosler, and told him about the children at Stara Gradiška. Brosler was horrified, and with the support of representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross began to place pressure on the NDH government to release the children. Budisavljević also used her <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> German Army to intervene with the Ustaše regime on behalf of the children.|$|E
5|$|Despite his <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> imperials, Euphemius was now {{willing to}} serve as their guide, evidently hoping that the Muslims, humbled by their failure and without the strong will of Asad to guide them, could now be made to serve his purposes. After Mineo surrendered, the Muslim army divided in two: one part took Agrigento in the west, while the other, along with Euphemius, {{attacked}} Enna. The garrison of Enna began negotiations, offering to acknowledge Euphemius' authority, but when Euphemius with a small escort met with their emissaries, he was murdered. It is unknown what happened to Euphemius' supporters after his death, whether they dispersed or continued fighting alongside the Muslims.|$|E

5|$|In 572 the Byzantine ruler JustinII (reigned 565–578) {{refused to}} renew the annual {{payments}} to Sassanid Persia that {{had been part of}} the peace agreement concluded by his uncle, JustinianI (r. 527–565) and the Persian shah KhosrauI (r. 531–579) in 562. This marked the culmination of the progressive deterioration of Byzantine–Persian relations over the previous years, which manifested itself in diplomatic and military manoeuvring in their geopolitical periphery. Thus the Byzantines initiated <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Central Asian Göktürks for a joint effort against Persia, while the Persians intervened in Yemen against the Christian Axumites, allies of Byzantium. Justin furthermore regarded the annual tribute as an indignity unworthy of Romans, and used the outbreak of a major revolt in Persian Armenia in 571–572 as a pretext for refusing to continue the payments.|$|E
5|$|In January 1962, Suharto was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} major general and appointed to lead Operation Mandala, a joint army-navy-air force command based in Makassar. This formed the military side of the campaign to win western New Guinea from the Dutch, who were preparing it for its own independence, separate from Indonesia. In 1965, Suharto was assigned operational command of Sukarno's Konfrontasi, against the newly formed Malaysia. Fearful that Konfrontasi would leave Java thinly covered by the army, and hand control to the 2 million-strong Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), he authorised a Kostrad intelligence officer, Ali Murtopo, to open secret <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British and Malaysians.|$|E
5|$|In October 1940, Marcinkus reached Liverpool, {{and from}} there {{travelled}} on to London. On 24 December of the same year, Marcinkus became a pilot in the Royal Air Force (RAF). To achieve that, he changed some of his personal data; he stated that he was three years younger, otherwise {{he would have been}} too old for service in the RAF. At that time, his homeland Lithuania had already lost its independence, and the Lithuanian air force was rapidly liquidated by its occupiers. Throughout the years, Maricinkus maintained close <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian attaché in Britain in order to receive news about Lithuania and his family.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{economic}} and general civilizational achievement, the most advanced region that corresponds to the modern boundaries of Poland in the 9th century was Pomerania. It was also characterized by the most extensive <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> external world, and accordingly, the greatest cultural richness and diversity. Pomerania was a favorite destination for traders and other entrepreneurs from distant lands, some of whom established local manufacturing and trade centers; those were usually accompanied by nearby gords inhabited by the local elite. Some of these complexes gave rise to early towns or urban centers such as Wolin, Pyrzyce or Szczecin. The Bavarian Geographer mentioned two tribes, the Velunzani ("Uelunzani") and Pyritzans ("Prissani") in the area, each with 70 towns. Despite {{the high level of}} economic advancement, no social structures indicative of statehood developed in Farther Pomeranian societies, except for the Wolin city-state.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century the Portuguese made {{commercial}} <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> town {{and established a}} commercial centre in 1554 CE. The Portuguese also conducted missionary enterprise here. In 1658, the Dutch made an agreement with King Vijaya Nayakkar of Thanjavur on 5 January 1662, by which ten villages were transferred from the Portuguese to the Dutch — Nagapattinam Port, Puthur, Muttam, Poruvalancheri, Anthanappettai, Karureppankadu, AzhingiMangalam, Sangamangalam, Thiruthinamangalam, Manjakollai, Nariyankudi. Ten Christian churches and a hospital were built by the Dutch. They released Pagoda coins with the name Nagapattinam engraved in Tamil. As per agreement between the first Maratta King Egoji of Thanjavur and the Dutch, Naagapattinam and surrounding villages were {{handed over to the}} Dutch on 30 December 1676. In 1690, the capital of Dutch Coromandel changed from Pulicat to Nagapattinam.|$|E
5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a material witness {{in the course of}} the disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his witnesses in the absence of the other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E
