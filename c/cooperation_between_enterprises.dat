The industrial psychologist's primary role is therefore {{to be found in}} the joint planning as well as the diagnosis and maintenance of personnel and man-machine systems. Productivity has its human implications, both as far as human input and the satisfaction of human needs are concerned. The future is likely to place additional demands on human potential and creativity. This calls for systematic personnel work, more particularly the development of South Africa's human resources. Industrial mental health should be considered not only as an influence on productivity, but as a criterion by itself. In spite of considerable costs of occupational maladjustment, both for industry and the community of which it is part, many employers tend to neglect their responsibility in this regard. There is room for more systematic guidance and closer <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> <b>enterprise</b> and scientist in order that basic research, training and practical needs may be aligned.
