25|$|In words, the {{standardized}} moneyness {{is the number}} of standard deviations the current forward price is above the strike price. Thus the moneyness is zero when the forward price of the underlying equals the strike price, when the option is at-the-money-forward. Standardized moneyness is measured in standard deviations from this point, with a positive value meaning an in-the-money <b>call</b> <b>option</b> and a negative value meaning an out-of-the-money <b>call</b> <b>option</b> (with signs reversed for a put option).|$|E

40|$|A trading {{strategy}} is developed {{to evaluate the}} market profitability of four different pricing models in detecting under-priced <b>call</b> <b>options.</b> Included in the evaluation are the Black-Scholes Model and three binomial lattice models implemented on parallel computers. The results show that option pricing models that incorporate stochastic volatility have higher daily profitability and are therefore better able to detect underpriced <b>call</b> <b>options</b> than pricing models that assume constant volatility (e. g., the BlackScholes Model). On an average, none of the four pricing models do significantly better at detecting under-priced <b>call</b> <b>options</b> than a random selection of <b>call</b> <b>options.</b> All five trading techniques are found to produce losses when used in simulated long-term trading. 1 Introduction 1. 1 <b>Call</b> <b>Options</b> <b>Call</b> <b>options</b> on stocks are contracts that give {{the owner of the}} contract the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a specified stock in the future at a specified price.

The first {{aim is to}} study {{the relationship between the}} TAIEX <b>call</b> <b>options</b> market and the spot market among different levels of Moneyness, namely, deep-in-the-money, in-the-money, at-the-money, deep-out-of-the-money, as well as out-of-the-money. The other one is to build a pricing model of TAIEX <b>call</b> <b>options.</b> The experimental data presented in this study come from the daily closing transaction price of TAIEX <b>call</b> <b>options</b> and the associated spot market from September 24, 2001 to August 31, 2003. This investigation applied the Bi_EGARCH model to study the interactive relationship of returns and volatility between TAIEX <b>call</b> <b>options</b> and the spot market, and used the Neuron Algorithm to establish a model for pricing TAIEX <b>call</b> <b>options.</b> This study reaches two main findings. First, the interactive relationship between TAIEX <b>call</b> <b>options</b> and the spot market differs among different Moneyness, and investors take larger risks under out-of-the-money and deep-out-of-money situations. Second, the prediction ability of the neural network pricing model is better than that of the regression model given different levels of Moneyness in most circumstances...|$|R

25|$|A trader who {{expects a}} stock's price to {{increase}} {{can buy a}} <b>call</b> <b>option</b> to purchase the stock at a fixed price ("strike price") at a later date, rather than purchase the stock outright.

25|$|Callability — Some bonds {{give the}} issuer {{the right to}} repay the bond before the {{maturity}} date on the call dates; see <b>call</b> <b>option.</b> These bonds {{are referred to as}} callable bonds. Most callable bonds allow the issuer to repay the bond at par. With some bonds, the issuer has to pay a premium, the so-called call premium. This is mainly the case for high-yield bonds. These have very strict covenants, restricting the issuer in its operations. To be free from these covenants, the issuer can repay the bonds early, but only at a high cost.|$|E

A Hardcall feature would not need any specific conditions beyond a date: that case the issuer would be able to recall a portion or the totally of the issuance at the Call price (typically par) after a specific date.|$|E

25|$|The {{holder of}} an American style <b>call</b> <b>option</b> can sell his option holding {{at any time}} until the {{expiration}} date, and would consider doing so when the stock's spot price is above the exercise price, especially if he expects {{the price of the}} option to drop. By selling the option early in that situation, the trader can realise an immediate profit. Alternatively, he can exercise the option — for example, if there is no secondary market for the options — and then sell the stock, realising a profit. A trader would make a profit if the spot price of the shares rises by more than the premium. For example, if the exercise price is 100 and premium paid is 10, then if the spot price of 100 rises to only 110 the transaction is break-even; an increase in stock price above 110 produces a profit.|$|E
25|$|The seller may grant {{an option}} to a buyer as part of another transaction, such as a share issue {{or as part of}} an {{employee}} incentive scheme, otherwise a buyer would pay a premium to the seller for the option. A <b>call</b> <b>option</b> would normally be exercised only when the strike price is below the market value of the underlying asset, while a put option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is above the market value. When an option is exercised, the cost to the buyer of the asset acquired is the strike price plus the premium, if any. When the option expiration date passes without the option being exercised, then the option expires and the buyer would forfeit the premium to the seller. In any case, the premium is income to the seller, and normally a capital loss to the buyer.|$|E
