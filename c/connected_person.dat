50|$|Dehumanization has {{applications}} outside {{traditional social}} contexts. Anthropomorphism (i.e., perceiving in nonhuman entities {{mental and physical}} capacities that reflect humans) is the inverse of dehumanization, which occurs when characteristics that apply to humans are denied to other humans. Waytz, Epley, and Cacioppo suggest that the inverse {{of the factors that}} facilitate dehumanization (e.g., high status, power, and social connection) should facilitate anthropomorphism. That is, a low status, socially disconnected person without power should be more likely to attribute human qualities to pets or electronics than a high-status, high-power, socially <b>connected</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In his 2012 book, Mindmelding: Consciousness, Neuroscience, and the Mind's Privacy, Hirstein {{argues that}} a {{significant}} block to solving the mind-body problem can be removed if we allow {{that it is possible}} for one person to directly experience the conscious mind of another. The vast majority of philosophers and scientists writing about consciousness believe that this is impossible, but this would mean that conscious brain states are different from all other physical states, which can be known about by multiple persons. This creates a block to understanding our minds as physical systems. Hirstein describes how [...] "mindmelding" [...] could be achieved by <b>connecting</b> <b>person</b> A's prefrontal lobes to person B's posterior cortex, which would in effect <b>connect</b> <b>person</b> A's sense of self to person B's conscious thoughts and sensations.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{tendency}} to connect to the Internet, and the online and offline shopping behavior of <b>connected</b> <b>persons,</b> to draw inferences about whether the Internet is a substitute or a complement for cities. We document that larger markets have more locally-targeted online content and that individuals {{are more likely to}} connect in markets with more local online content, suggesting the Internet is a complement to cities. Yet, holding local online content constant, people are less likely to connect in larger markets, indicating that the Internet is also a substitute for cities. We also find that individuals connect to overcome local isolation: notwithstanding a large digital divide, blacks are more likely to connect, relative to whites, when they comprise a smaller fraction of local population, making the Internet a substitute for agglomeration of preference minorities within cities. Finally, using online and offline spending data, we find that <b>connected</b> <b>persons</b> spend more on books and clothing online, relative to their offline spending, if they are farther from offline stores. This indicates that the Internet functions as a substitute for proximity to retail outlets. ...|$|R

The first chapter explains the context of sec. 196 a CC within Czech legal system and provides overview of another rules regulating self-dealing and transactions with conflict of interest under Czech law. The self-dealing rules of sec. 196 a CC apply both to management transactions and shareholders transactions. The purpose and origin of sec. 196 a CC is examined in the next chapter. It is partially a result of implementation of European Law (article 11 of Second Company Law Directive 77 / 91 /EC). However, its purpose comprises also protection of company's assets, shareholders, minority shareholders and third parties (such as creditors of the company). The third chapter is considering requirements of sec. 196 a CC as regards loan agreements concluded between {{the company and the}} <b>connected</b> <b>persons,</b> provision of security by the company and free transfers of company's property {{for the benefit of the}} <b>connected</b> <b>persons.</b> The thesis focuses on interpretation of a definition of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In this Note {{a social}} network model for opinion {{formation}} is proposed {{in which a}} <b>person</b> <b>connected</b> to q partners pays an attention 1 /q to each partner. The mutual attention between two <b>connected</b> <b>persons</b> i and j is taken equal to the geometric mean 1 /√(q_iq_j). Opinion is represented as usual by an Ising spin s=± 1 and mutual attention is given through a two-spin coupling J_ij = J Q/√(q_iq_j), Q being the average connectivity in the network. Connectivity diminishes attention and only persons with low connectivity can {{pay special attention to}} each other leading to a durable common (or opposing) opinion.
