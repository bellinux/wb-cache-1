40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a {{neighbourhood}} structure based on sequential/cyclic moves and a <b>Cyclic</b> <b>Transfer</b> algorithm for the high school timetabling problem. This method enables execution of complex moves for improving an existing solution, while dealing with the challenge of exploring the neighbourhood efficiently. An improvement graph is used in which certain negative cycles correspond to the neighbours; these cy-cles are explored using a recursive method. We address the problem of applying large neighbourhood structure methods on problems where the cost function is not exactly the sum of independent cost functions, {{as it is in the}} set partitioning problem. For computational experiments we use four real world datasets for high school timetabling in the Netherlands and England. We present results of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>transfer</b> algorithm with different settings on these datasets. The costs decrease by 8 % to 28 % if we use the cyclic transfers for local optimization compared to our initial solutions. The quality of the best initial solutions are comparable to the solutions found in practice by timetablers. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of efficient heuristics for Vehicle Routing and Scheduling Problems {{has been the}} subject of many research activities during the last decades. Most of the algorithms published up to now can only be applied to instances of problem types specific to the algorithm. The according lack of robustness with regard to changes in the model structure is a serious problem in practical applications. The contribution of this thesis is the {{development of}} high-performance improvement heuristics based on a general resource model that enables the formulation of different constraints, e. g., restrictions of tour duration or tour length, vehicle capacities, time windows, order dependencies, or incompatibility of tasks. Heuristics based on this general model are able to solve a larger part of all Vehicle Routing and Scheduling Problems. Edge-exchange neigborhoods and <b>Cyclic</b> <b>Transfer</b> neigborhoods are two large classes of neigborhoods well-known in the literature. The thesis shows that these neigborhoods can be efficiently searched, taking into account constraints on the resources. The integration of these neigborhoods into a meta-heuristic is the underlying intension of the work, although it is not the subject of consideration itself. An additional contribution of the work consists of the generalization, further development, and partially new formal description of basic concepts of these neigborhoods. The introduction of new appropriate notions and definitions facilitates the illustration of known results as well as the derivation of new insights. Numerous alternatives in the implementation of known methods are discovered by generalizations. Methodologically, the thesis is based on a publication of Savelsbergh from 1985. There, the author describes how time window restrictions can be checked efficiently in 2 -opt and 3 -opt neigborhoods using a lexicographic search strategy. The ideas of Savelsbergh are extended and applied to generalized resources and arbitrary k-opt neigborhoods. The efficient check of different constraints can, therefore, be performed by a general uniform scheme. Several constraints can be taken into account at the same time even if they are partially dependent on each other. Furthermore, a new problem formulation published in 2001 by Ahuja, Orlin, and Sharma is adapted for Vehicle Routing and Scheduling Problems and used for the search in <b>Cyclic</b> <b>Transfer</b> neigborhoods. This formulation allows to implicitly search very large <b>Cyclic</b> <b>Transfer</b> neigborhoods on the basis of a Dynamic Programming methodology. In these neigborhoods the compliance with the constraints can be checked for partial solutions in advance, as in a preprocessing step. Thereby, the same operations as used within the k-opt neigborhoods can be applied. The thesis is intendedly focused on the design of the local search, which is the core element of many up-to-date meta-heuristics, e. g., Tabu Search, Variable Neighborhood Search, Iterated Local Search, and Guided Local Search. Using the developed models and methods, it is for the first time possible to efficiently search two large classes of neigborhoods, based on a very general resource model. The presented results indicate that even pure local search can outperform many well-known meta-heuristics. It can be expected that the proper integration into a meta-heuristic framework should be superior to most implementations available today. This is a promising path for future research...|$|E

The predicted stress distribution includes a local minimum in stress at depths less than typical seismogenic depths. The width of this stress 'trough' depends on the magnitude of crustal stress relative to asthenospheric drag stresses. The models further predict a local near-fault stress maximum at greater depths, sustained by the <b>cyclic</b> <b>transfer</b> of strain from the elastic crust to the ductile asthenosphere. Models incorporating both low-stress and high-stress fault strength assumptions are examined, under Newtonian and non-Newtonian rheology assumptions.

40|$|Hydrogen {{transfer}} {{reactions are}} among the most fundamental organic reactions. They are involved in nearly all enzyme-catalyzed reactions necessary for the sustenance of life, and they are often involved in key steps in synthetically useful reductions. Notable among synthetically useful reactions are the class of reactions known as C–H bond functionalization. It is surprising, then, that this most fundamental chemical event is so poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we have developed new experimental and computational approaches that allow interrogation of the core physical nature of <b>cyclic</b> hydrogen <b>transfer</b> reactions. In general, our laboratory utilizes kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) to probe chemical reactions. This technique involves accurately determining how replacement of atoms with their heavier isotopes affects the reaction rate (or product distribution). In order to extract the most insightful information from KIE studies, suitable experiments and measurement methods need to be well-designed and carefully executed. This dissertation is composed of four chapters. The first chapter serves as a general introduction that lays out the background of the mechanistic study of <b>cyclic</b> hydrogen <b>transfer,</b> the concepts of kinetic isotope effect and a concise review of traditional and new techniques that utilize KIEs to elucidate reaction mechanisms. The remaining chapters present three unique studies that culminate in a unified view of <b>cyclic</b> hydrogen <b>transfers.</b> Each study is designed to interrogate the key physical aspects of a synthetically useful and mechanistically interesting hydrogen transfer. The first study explores the Chugaev elimination, which is used to transform alcohols into alkenes in a typically regioselective manner. In this study, we have used a combination of intermolecular and intramolecular 2 H KIE measurements to demonstrate that this reaction is dominated by quantum mechanical behavior even though it occurs at elevated temperatures. Comparison between the experimental and computational results imply that the observed KIEs are influenced by the location of the bottleneck (or transition state) which is found to be dependent on the isotopic substitution. Chapter 3 explores the Cope elimination, which can be used to install alkenes adjacent to an amine, demonstrated that seemingly simple <b>cyclic</b> hydrogen <b>transfer</b> reactions can proceed simultaneously via multiple mechanisms depending upon driving force and temperatures. Our approaches in the Cope and Chugaev eliminations were then utilized to explore an exciting new C–H functionalization reaction developed by DuBois. This study demonstrates that cyclic H-transfers mediated by a Ru-nitrene species are fundamentally similar to relatively simpler syn- eliminations in terms of the involvement of quantum mechanical phenomena.

In mainstream Minimalism, Agree is strictly downward “probing” (Chomsky 2000, 2001, Boskovic 2007, Epstein 2 ̆ 6 Seely 2006), but some recent works argue instead that Agree always looks upwards (Zeijlstra 2012; Wurmbrand 2012). A third perspective takes agreement to follow from the Spec, head configuration (Koopman 2006; and see Chomsky’s 2013 labeling through shared prominent features), and under a fourth proposal, the directionality of Agree varies parametrically (Baker 2008). While each of these approaches has some empirical support, none achieves the strict conceptual necessity that is a central goal of Minimalist theory.

40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} of the research is to investigate the effect of periodic switching on/off in cyclical pumping on resistance to wear of high voltage electric motors of main pump units. Frequent motors starts in a cyclic pumping lead to accelerated wear of the mechanical motor parts owing {{to the impact of}} dynamic loads at startup, as well as winding insulation due to high inrush currents flow. As a result accelerated depreciation may decrease residual life, overhaul period and service life of electric motors. The main factors affecting the service life of insulation motors are winding temperature, and as a consequence, the thermal aging of the insulation. The use of variable frequency drive can significantly reduce the <b>cyclic</b> <b>transfer</b> modes, or even eliminate them. The authors obtained analytical expressions for the evaluation of insulation deterioration {{at the start of the}} motor, which allow us to study the impact of the following factors: insulation class, the start time, break time at work, initial and nominal temperature, the temperature rise of the windings over the ambient temperature. Cold starts and hot operating conditions, as well as the percentage of the hottest startups in the total number of starts have a drastic impact on insulation deterioration. The obtained expressions for the isolation depreciation are used to determine the change timing of overhauls of high voltage electric main pump units.

We show that {{only a fraction of}} the ATP-synthase is present in the membrane regions which contain most of the photosynthetic apparatus and that, despite its complicated stacked structure, the intracytoplasmic membrane delimits a single connected space. We find that the diffusion time required for a quinol released by the reaction centre to reach a cytochrome bc 1 complex is about 260  ms. On the other hand, the reduction of the cytochrome c chain by the cytochrome bc 1 complex in the presence of a reduced quinone pool occurs with a time constant of about 5  ms.

Oscillations enable the construction of coherently organised neuronal assemblies through establishing transitory temporal correlations. By exploring the elementary operations of the language faculty – labeling, concatenation, <b>cyclic</b> <b>transfer</b> – alongside neural dynamics, a new model of linguistic computation is proposed. It is argued that the universality of language, and the true biological source of Universal Grammar, is not to be found purely in the genome as has long been suggested, but more specifically within the extraordinarily preserved nature of mammalian brain rhythms employed in the computation of linguistic structures. Computational-representational theories are used as a guide in investigating the neurobiological foundations of the human ‘cognome’ – the set of computations performed by the nervous system – and new directions are suggested for how the dynamics of brain (the ‘dynome’) operates and execute linguistic operations. The extent to which brain rhythms are the suitable neuronal processes which can capture the computational properties of the human language faculty is considered against a backdrop of existing cartographic research into the localisation of linguistic interpretation. Particular focus is placed on labeling, the operation elsewhere argued to be species-specific. A Basic Label model of the human cognome-dynome is proposed, leading to clear, causally-addressable empirical predictions, to be investigated by a suggested research program, Dynamic Cognomics.

40|$|The capacitated minimum {{spanning}} tree (CMST) problem {{is to find a}} minimum cost {{spanning tree}} with an additional cardinality constraint on the sizes of the subtrees incident to a given root node. The CMST problem is an NP-complete problem, and existing exact algorithms can solve only small size problems. Currently, the best available heuristic procedures for the CMST problem are tabu search algorithms due to Amberg et al. and Sharaiha et al. These algorithms use two-exchange neighborhood structures that are based on exchanging a single node or a set of nodes between two subtrees. In this paper, we generalize their neighborhood structures to allow exchanges of nodes among multiple subtrees simultaneously; we refer to such neighborhood structures as multi-exchange neighborhood structures. Our first multiexchange neighborhood structure allows exchanges of single nodes among several subtrees. Our second multi-exchange neighborhood structure allows exchanges that involve multiple subtrees. The size of each of these neighborhood structures grows exponentially with the problem size without any substantial increase in the computational times needed to find improved neighbors.

In this thesis, constitutive models APS-I, APS-II and UCASC are developed to account for the stiffness and strength degradation of clays under cyclic loading. Instead of following the cyclic behavior of the clay in the scale of time, the models are based on semi-explicit method in which the cyclic behavior of clays are described as a function of cyclic number. In this way, the computational time is more economic and the better precision is reached. In APS-I model, an accumulated yield surface is used. An accumulated plastic strain hardening rule and a <b>cyclic</b> <b>transfer</b> rule are formulated to describe the anisotropic accumulated plastic strain developed in clays under cyclic loading as a function of cyclic stress ratio, average stress ratio and equivalent cyclic number. Besides, NGI-ADP yield surface is used in the model to account for the static plastic strain developed. In this way, the average strength reduction can also be captured as a by-product of the model when the failure strain is reached. The model is implemented with a backward Euler integration scheme. The validity of the model is proved by the comparison between the test results and calculation results of the Drammen clay and Moum clay. Furthermore, in order to improve the precision of the capture of the average strength reduction, an improved APS-II model is formulated with more accurate accumulated plastic strain hardening rule and <b>cyclic</b> <b>transfer</b> rule. The improvement of the APS-II model is also shown from the comparison between the tests results and calculated results of the Drammen clay and the Moum clay. In addition, a new UCASC-AV model is proposed. One yield surface is used in the UCASCAV model to account for both static strain and accumulated plastic strain. An average strength reduction rule is formulated. Equivalent cyclic number Neq can be updated automatically with the cyclic stress level and the cycle number increment ΔN. Average stiffness degradation is predicted as a by-product of the average strength degradation. Thus, the average strain developed in the clay under cyclic loading can be predicted. In addition, a new UCASC-CY model is also proposed. A cyclic strength reduction rule is formulated to relate the cyclic strength reduction to the cyclic number. Nonlinear elasticity is adopted in the model. Thus, the cyclic strain developed in the clay under cyclic loading can be calculated. The validity of the UCASC models is proved through the comparison between the test results and calculated results of the Drammen clay. Finally, a calculation procedure for the combination of the UCASC-AV model and the UCASC-CY model is proposed for the offshore foundation calculation. At the end of the thesis, accommodations of the future work are given, including the inclusion of the excess pore pressure generated during the cyclic loading and the inclusion of the small strain stiffness...|$|E
50|$|Moyle's {{first major}} research, in {{collaboration}} with Dorothy L. Foster, focused on the interconversion of lactic acid and glycogen in muscle, recapitulating the work of Otto Meyerhof. After that, she studied the roles of succinic acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid in muscle metabolism, {{as well as the}} biochemical differences and relationships between aerobic and anaerobic pathways. She subsequently worked on <b>cyclic</b> phosphate <b>transfer</b> in muscle contraction and, with collaborators, established {{for the first time a}} direct correlation of structure and function in muscle by confirming in 1939 that myosin, the contractile protein of muscle, behaves as the enzyme ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase).|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the results from the}} analysis of an experimental investigation with the aim to provide insight to the <b>cyclic,</b> instantaneous heat <b>transfer</b> phenomena occurring in both the cylinder head and exhaust manifold wall surfaces of a direct injection (DI), air-cooled diesel engine. The mechanism of <b>cyclic</b> heat <b>transfer</b> is investigated during engine transient events, viz, after a sudden change in engine speed and/or load, both for the combustion chamber and exhaust manifold surfaces. These results are then compared with relevant experimental data from steady state operation which in the present case are used as reference helping to reveal any potential influences of each transient event on <b>cyclic</b> heat <b>transfer.</b> The experimental installation allowed both long- and short-term signal types to be recorded on a common time reference base during the transient event. Processing of experimental data was accomplished using a modified version of one-dimensional heat conduction theory with Fourier analysis, capable to cater for the special characteristics of transient engine operation. Based on this model, the evolution of local surface heat flux during a transient event was calculated. Two engine transient events are examined, which present a key difference in the way the load and speed changes are imposed on each one of them. From the analysis of experimental results it is confirmed that each thermal transient event consists of two distinguished phases the "thermodynamic" and the "structural" one which are appropriately configured and analyzed. In the case of a severe variation, in the first 20 cycles after the beginning of the transient event, the wall surface temperature amplitude on cylinder head was almost three times higher than the one observed at the "normal" temperature oscillations occurring during the steady state operation. At the same time, peak pressure values in the same cycles are increased by almost 15 % above their corresponding values at the final steady state. The same phenomena are valid for the exhaust manifold surfaces but on a moderated scale. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The puf operon in Rhodobacter sphaeroides {{contains}} the genes for the light-harvesting antenna complex I (LHI), the reaction centre (RC) L and M subunits {{and an additional}} small open reading frame identified as pufX. It has been demonstrated before that a photosynthetically incompetent pufLMX deletion strain was not complemented by a plasmid-borne truncated puf operon version lacking only pufX, although expression of the pufL and pufM gene products was restored. We demonstrate here that the functional reinsertion of only the pufX open reading frame into the same construct is sufficient and necessary for complementation of the non-photosynthetic phenotype. We also demonstrate that the observed lack of photoheterotrophic growth {{in the absence of}} pufX is not the result of decreased light-harvesting ability, but rather the result of an impairment in light-driven <b>cyclic</b> electron <b>transfer.</b> Western blots using polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a portion of the DNA-derived pufX amino acid sequence showed that the pufX open reading frame is expressed and that the gene product has an M(r) of 8 - 10, 000 on SDS gels; a value close to the predicted mass of 9 kDa. The pufX polypeptide was localized to the intracytoplasmic membrane fraction and appeared to co-purify with the RC-LHI complex. It is suggested that the pufX polypeptide is associated with the RC-LHI complex and that it may {{play a critical role in}} facilitating the interaction between this complex and other components required for light-driven <b>cyclic</b> electron <b>transfer...</b>|$|R
