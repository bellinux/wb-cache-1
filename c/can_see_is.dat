5|$|At the FBI Academy, Dana Scully reads Mulder's initial report. The only {{connection}} between the murders that he <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> that the suspects all destroyed an electronic device during the killings. Meanwhile, Bonnie McRoberts, another Franklin resident, drops by a repair shop {{to pick up her}} car, where a message on an engine diagnostic display warns her that the mechanic is going to rape her. She impulsively kills him with an oil can spout. When Mulder and Spencer question her the next morning, her kitchen microwave instructs her to kill them. When she grabs a knife and attacks Mulder, she is shot and killed by Spencer.|$|E
25|$|Flies {{searching for}} an {{egg-laying}} site are attracted by fecal odors coming from the vent pipe, but they are prevented from entering by the flyscreen at the outlet of the vent pipe. Some flies may enter into the pit via the squat hole and lay their eggs there. When new adult flies emerge, they instinctively fly towards light. However, if the latrine is dark inside, the only light they <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> {{at the top of}} the vent pipe. Since the vent pipe is covered by a fly screen at the top, flies will not be able to escape and eventually will die and fall back into the pit.|$|E

Describing the character, he stated, [...] "I go onstage wearing almost nothing. I have underwear and my boots on, and I paint my whole head black—from the neck up—and I have the black contacts. All you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> these glowing teeth." [...] Borland's black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the science fiction TV series Babylon 5.|$|E

500|$|A mutant {{member of}} the Hellfire Club, {{with the ability to}} create {{powerful}} whirlwinds from his hands and body. First Class marks the first English-language film for González, who auditioned while taking English classes in London. He enjoyed playing a villain as most of his film roles in Spain were for [...] "good guys", and compared Riptide's respectable and polite personality, which can suddenly be dropped to perform fierce attacks, to a hurricane; in a translation of a Portuguese-language interview, he is quoted as saying, [...] "When I see a hurricane from far, it is calm. The only thing I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> a kind of tube. But from inside, up close, it is really dangerous." ...|$|E

[...] Ne-Yo further stated that Rihanna is not afraid to trying new things and from the first moment she heard the song he knew she would like it, [...] "I trust Rihanna to be Rihanna, and she trusts me to be me. That's the coolest thing about our relationship. I must say this song is a step in somewhat of a different direction for both of us." [...] When Harmony heard the song, both he and Ne-Yo were aware that they should change some elements and that it had to be darker and edgier.|$|E
2500|$|Cuppy's best-known work, a satire {{on history}} called The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody, was {{unfinished}} when he died. Its humor ranges from the remark that, when the Nile floods receded, the land, {{as far as}} the eye <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>is</b> [...] "covered by Egyptologists", to the detailed dissection, quotation, and parody, in the chapter on Alexander the Great, of the picture of Alexander as an idealist for world peace. The book's appeal can be gauged by the fact that CBS broadcaster Edward R. Murrow and his colleague Don Hollenbeck took turns reading from it on the air [...] "until the announcer cracked up." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{a pilgrimage}} to Rome, he joined the poor in begging at St. Peter's Basilica. He {{spent some time in}} lonely places, asking God for spiritual enlightenment. He said he had a mystical vision of Jesus Christ in the forsaken country chapel of San Damiano, just outside Assisi, in which the Icon of Christ Crucified said to him, [...] "Francis, Francis, go and repair My house which, as you <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>is</b> falling into ruins." [...] He took this to mean the ruined church in which he was {{presently}} praying, and so he sold some cloth from his father's store to assist the priest there for this purpose. When the priest refused to accept the ill-gotten gains, an indignant Francis threw the coins on the floor.|$|E
2500|$|Although Kobach's {{campaign}} treasurer, Tom Arpke, possessed campaign experience, {{losing a}} state senate race in 2008, winning a Salina City Council seat the next year, {{and a state}} House seat in 2010, he {{was found to have}} under-reported contributions by $35,000 and nearly $43,000 in expenditures in Kobach's 2010 campaign, resulting in a maximum $5,000 fine. Kobach complained that he was being discriminated against because former Republican Governor Bill Graves received a much smaller fine for similar violations. Kobach alleged, [...] "The only real distinction I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> that I'm a conservative and he's a moderate." [...] The chair of the Kansas ethics commission said [...] "The commission does not condone lack of candor before the commission." [...] When he obtained convictions of Kansans for interstate voting irregularities in 2016, Kobach said, [...] "The fines are “exactly what I wanted to see in cases like this when I made the case before Kansas Legislature that this authority was needed ... A $5,000 fine is very significant, and hopefully something no one would want to have to pay”, he said.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a pilgrimage}} to Rome, where he begged at the church doors for the poor, Francis said {{he had had a}} mystical vision of Jesus Christ in the wayside chapel of San Damiano, about two miles outside of Assisi, in which the Icon of Christ Crucified came alive and said to him three times, [...] "Francis, Francis, go and repair My house which, as you <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>is</b> falling into ruins". Francis took this {{literally}} to mean the ruined church in which he was presently praying, and so sold his horse and some cloth from his father's store, to assist the priest there for this purpose. [...] His father Pietro, highly indignant, sought restitution. After a final interview {{in the presence of the}} bishop, Francis renounced his father and his patrimony, laying aside even the garments he had received from him. For the next couple of months he lived as a beggar in the region of Assisi. Returning to the town for two years this time, he restored several ruined churches, among them the Porziuncola, little chapel of St Mary of the Angels, just outside the town.|$|E

2500|$|Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter {{described}} Blindness as [...] "provocative but predictable cinema", startling but {{failing to}} surprise. Honeycutt criticized the film's two viewpoints: Julianne Moore's character, {{the only one}} who <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>is</b> slow to act against atrocities, and the behavior of Danny Glover's character comes off as [...] "slightly pompous". Honeycutt explained, [...] "This philosophical coolness is what most undermines the emotional response to Meirelles' film. His fictional calculations are all so precise and a tone of deadly seriousness swamps the grim action." [...] Justin Chang of Variety described the film: [...] "Blindness emerges onscreen both overdressed and undermotivated, scrupulously hitting the novel's beats yet barely approximating, so to speak, its vision." [...] Chang thought that Julianne Moore gave a strong performance but did not feel that the film captured the impact of Saramago's novel. Roger Ebert called Blindness [...] "one of the most unpleasant, not to say unendurable, films I've ever seen." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated that, although it [...] "is not a great film, ... it is, nonetheless, full of examples of what good filmmaking looks like." ...|$|E
