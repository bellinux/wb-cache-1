40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effects of using crushed ceramic in the production of interlocking paving units. Eight mixes were cast. The first mix was the control mix, in which natural aggregates were used in the upper and lower layers. In the second and third mixes, coarse crushed ceramic was used in the lower layer replacing 50 % and 100 % of crushed stone, respectively. In the fourth and fifth mixes, <b>fine</b> <b>crushed</b> ceramic was used in the lower layer replacing 50 % and 100 % of natural sand, respectively. In the sixth mix, <b>coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> <b>crushed</b> ceramic were used in the lower layer replacing 50 % of crushed stone and 50 % of natural sand, respectively. Finally, in the seventh and eighth mixes, <b>fine</b> <b>crushed</b> ceramic was used in the upper layer replacing 50 % and 100 % of natural sand, respectively while natural sand was used in the lower layer. Tests were carried out in order to investigate the properties of the manufactured specimens after 28 days of curing. Compressive strength and abrasion resistance were determined according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM C 140 and ASTM C 418, respectively). Water absorption, split tensile strength, abrasion resistance, as well as, skid resistance were determined according to both Egyptian Standard Specifications (ESS 4382) and European Standard (EN 1338). The Egyptian standard is identical with the European standard. The results indicate that it is feasible to use <b>fine</b> <b>crushed</b> ceramic in the manufacture of paving blocks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> woody debris are {{substantial}} forest ecosystem carbon stocks; however, {{there is a}} lack of understanding how these detrital carbon stocks vary across forested landscapes. Because forest woody detritus production and decay rates may partially depend on climatic conditions, the accumulation of <b>coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> woody debris carbon stocks in forests may be correlated with climate. This study used a nationwide inventory of <b>coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> woody debris in the United States to examine how these carbon stocks vary by climatic regions and variables. Results Mean <b>coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> woody debris forest carbon stocks vary by Köppen's climatic regions across the United States. The highest carbon stocks were found in regions with cool summers while the lowest carbon stocks were found in arid desert/steppes or temperate humid regions. <b>Coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> woody debris carbon stocks were found to be positively correlated with available moisture and negatively correlated with maximum temperature. Conclusion It was concluded with only medium confidence that <b>coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> woody debris carbon stocks may be at risk of becoming net emitter of carbon under a global climate warming scenario as increases in <b>coarse</b> or <b>fine</b> woody debris production (sinks) may be more than offset by increases in forest woody detritus decay rates (emission). Given the preliminary results of this study and the rather tenuous status of <b>coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> woody debris carbon stocks as either a source or sink of CO 2, further research is suggested in the areas of forest detritus decay and production. </p...|$|R

40|$|Currently a lot {{of bottles}} of {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (PET) are discarded into the environment. In {{order to reduce the}} disposal of this polymer in nature, this study aims to evaluate the mechanical behavior of a clayey soil mixed with <b>fine</b> <b>crushed</b> PET. The potential use of this waste material in geotechnical applications may ultimately reduce the problem of improper disposal and improve the strength and deformation characteristics of the soil. This paper presents an experimental study to evaluate the mechanical behavior of pure soil and mixtures with different contents of PET waste by triaxial tests, in order to obtain the strength parameters of the Soil-PET mixtures. The clayey soil used was mixed with 10 and 20 percent of <b>fine</b> <b>crushed</b> PET by dry weight. Characterization tests such as grain size, Atterberg limits and compaction test were performed on the soil-PET mixtures. Triaxial tests at confining stresses of 50, 150 and 300 kPa were done on the soil and mixtures. The results show that the soil strength parameters are influenced by the addition of the <b>fine</b> <b>crushed</b> PET, thus improv-ing characteristics such as friction angle and cohesion of the Soil-PET mixtures. This improvement also depends on the confining level which the samples were submitted. These mixtures may be used in pavement and other geotechnical works, so this paper proposes to contribute to a better understandin...|$|R

40|$|Silicon Nitride has {{traditionally}} been used as rolling contact bearing material owing to its superior performance compared to bearing steels. Its successful application as a bearing element {{has led to the}} development of Silicon Nitride in other rolling contact applications in the automotive industry and the power industry. However, a major limitation of its wider application is its high material and machining cost, especially the cost associated with the finishing process. In the present study, a low cost sintered and reaction-bonded Silicon Nitride is used to study the surface machining effects on its rolling contact fatigue performance. Studies have been carried out to link the surface strengths of Silicon Nitride derived from half-rod and C-Sphere flexure strength specimens to the rolling contact lives of Silicon Nitride rod and ball specimens. The rolling contact fatigue tests were carried out on ball-on-rod and modified four-ball machines. Three types of surface with <b>coarse,</b> <b>fine</b> and RCF-conventional finishing conditions were examined. Flexure strength tests on half-rod and C-Sphere showed an increasing surface strength from specimens with <b>coarse,</b> <b>fine</b> to RCF-conventionally machined conditions. During rolling contact fatigue tests of as-machined specimens, no failures were observed on either ball-on-rod or four-ball tests after 100 million stress cycles. However, a trend of decreasing wear volumes was measured on the contact path of rods and balls with <b>coarse,</b> <b>fine</b> and RCF-conventional conditions. In four-ball tests, spall failures were observed on pre-cracked specimens. There was a trend of increasing rolling contact fatigue lifetime from pre-cracked specimens with <b>coarse,</b> <b>fine</b> to RCF-conventional machining conditions. The study of Silicon Nitride machining was also carried out using an eccentric lapping machine to investigate the effect of eccentricity on the finishing rate of hot isostatically-pressed and sintered and reaction-bonded Silicon Nitride. The eccentricity had no significant impact on finishing rate as concluded in this study. The effect of lubricant viscosity and chemistry on the rolling contact fatigue performance of Silicon Nitride was also studied. The result is inconclusive. ...|$|R

30|$|Recycled asphalt {{pavement}} (RAP) use in construction of {{asphalt pavement}}s {{is a common}} practice. Recent research studies examined the feasibility of incorporating RAP in Portland cement concrete (Huang et al. 2005, 2006). Two gradations of RAP (<b>coarse</b> and <b>fine)</b> materials were considered to replace the fresh aggregate from a control concrete mixture. The slump of concrete made with only <b>coarse</b> or <b>fine</b> RAP was {{lower than that of}} control concrete. While the slump of concrete made with both <b>coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> RAP was higher than that of control mix. The reason could be probably attributed to the asphalt coating around both <b>coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> RAP so that less water could be absorbed by the aggregates (Huang et al. 2005, 2006). The strength of concrete made with both <b>coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> RAP decreased the most among the RAP mixtures. The authors attributed the reduction in strength {{due to the fact that}} asphalt film around the aggregate particle was much softer than the concrete matrix and aggregate. Concrete made with only coarse RAP shows the least reduction in the strength of the RAP concretes and significant increase in toughness. Thus it might be more practical to incorporate a certain portion of coarse RAP to replace coarse aggregate (CA) (Huang et al. 2005, 2006).|$|R
