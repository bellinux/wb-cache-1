5|$|Writing {{about life}} in Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of Charles Darwin) {{describes}} the 'sport' of Stinkhorn hunting: In our native woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular The Stinkhorn, though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and there, her nostrils twitching, when she <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>whiff</b> <b>of</b> her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her basket. At {{the end of the}} day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; because of the morals of the maids.|$|E

There was also a splash below, and a confused clamour that {{was lost in the}} hasty thud of paddles as the invisible canoes got away. Then, while the Canarios came floundering across the deck, a single voice rose up.|$|E

60|$|Miss Calista {{lifted her}} head as he passed and sniffed the air as a charger who scents battle. The smell of tobacco was strong, and so {{was that of the}} open boxes of dried herring on the counter, but plainly, above all the commingled odours of a country grocery, Miss Calista <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>whiff</b> <b>of</b> peppermint, so strong as to leave no doubt of its origin.

60|$|People {{were waiting}} on the {{sidewalk}} to take the cars; a druggist's window threw its mellow lights into the street; from open cellar- ways came the sound of banjos and violins. At one of these cellar doors his guide lingered so long that Lemuel thought he should {{have to find the}} way beyond for himself. But the tramp suddenly commanded himself from the music, the light, and the smell of strong drink, which Lemuel <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>whiff</b> <b>of</b> as he followed, and turning a corner led the way to the side of a lofty building in a dark street, where they met other like shapes tending toward it from different directions.|$|E
60|$|Somebody {{started to}} clap hands, {{and the rest}} joined in, as two or three ladies entered the back part {{of the church and}} passed up the aisle. He looked up as they went by him, and caught a glimpse of a stately head of brown hair, {{modestly}} bent in acknowledgment of the applause, and he <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>whiff</b> <b>of</b> the delicate odor of violets. His eyes followed the strong, firm steps of the young woman who walked between the two older women. There was something fine and dignified in her walk, and the odor of her dress as she passed lingered with him, but he did not feel that this was the same woman, till she turned and faced him on the platform.|$|E

60|$|I {{came to a}} deep brush-choked gorge, impassable at that point. Luckily {{the hounds}} turned here and started back my way. By riding {{along the edge of}} this gorge I kept up with them. They climbed out an {{intersecting}} ravine and up on the opposite side. I forced my horse to go down this rather steep soft slope. At the bottom I saw a little spring of water with fresh bear tracks around it, and one place where the bear had caved in a soft bank. Here my horse suddenly plunged and went to his knees in the yielding red clay. He snorted in fright. The bank slid with him and I tumbled off. But nothing serious happened. I ran down, caught him, mounted, and spurred him up the other side. Once up he began to run. I heard the boys yelling not far away and the hounds were baying up above me. They were climbing fast, working to the left, toward an oak thicket. It took effort to slow down my steed. He acted crazy and I began to suspect that he had <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>whiff</b> <b>of</b> the bear. Most horses are afraid of bears and lions. Sight of Edd and George, who appeared in an open spot, somewhat quieted my mount.|$|E
50|$|Legends {{claims that}} when Nawab Asaf-ud-daulah (1748-1797) found his kingdom {{in the grip}} of famine, he {{initiated}} a food-for-work programme, employing thousands {{in the construction of the}} Bada Imambara shrine. Large cauldrons were filled with rice, meat, vegetables and spices and sealed to make a simple, one-dish meal that was available to workers day and night. Then, one day, the Nawab <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>whiff</b> <b>of</b> the aromas emanating from the cauldron and the royal kitchen was ordered to serve the dish.|$|E
5000|$|One day, {{while the}} owner of Café Cinnamon was admiring the sky, a tiny white puppy came {{floating}} by, looking just like a small, fluffy cloud. She thought, [...] "Maybe he <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>whiff</b> <b>of</b> the cinnamon rolls and came to check them out." [...] The owner of the café was correct. The curious little puppy took a shine to the café owner and her delicious cinnamon rolls, {{so he decided to}} stay. Since his tail was plump and curled up like a cinnamon roll, she decided to call him Cinnamon. Cinnamon became instantly popular with customers and soon became Café Cinnamon's official mascot. Now, when he is not napping on the café terrace, Cinnamon flies around the town looking for fun and new adventures with his friends Chiffon, Mocha, Espresso, Cappuccino, and Little Milk.|$|E

40|$|Ms. Whisner {{describes}} the method {{and some of}} the results reported in a recently published book about the reference interview written by two library school professors. She points out that despite its academic approach, the book has much to offer the practicing reference librarian. ¶ 1 When I was in library school, I sometimes <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>whiff</b> <b>of</b> defensiveness among the faculty. Some people in the outside world thought that library education must amount to little more than training students to stamp books and be fussy. And if these outsiders did not understand that regular librarians needed master’s degrees, then they certainly would not understand that the professors had Ph. D. s. Even within the academy, some faculty members from other fields might have occasionally suggested that library science was not much of a science (not even a social science). I am not saying that their defensiveness was not justified—the discipline does struggle for recognition. Indeed, many library students and librarians themselves roll their eyes and scoff at the idea of pursuing a doctorate. Who would want to write a dissertation about any of that stuff...|$|E
