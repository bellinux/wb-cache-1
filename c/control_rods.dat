40|$|In complex {{innovative}} {{fast reactor}} concepts, fairly detailed core modeling {{is essential for}} reliable safety analysis during severe accident scenarios. The CFV core with its axially heterogeneous design, has a negative sodium void reactivity effect, a favorable feature wich increases the inherent system safety in case of sodium boiling. In this work, we studied the impact that the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> homogenization model used, and the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> position, have on the sodium void-reactivity effect and the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> worth, {{in the case of}} a voided CFV core. Three different <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> homogenization models were studied, the traditional 2 D equivalence procedure, and two models based on a 3 D equivalence procedure, taking into account the axial heterogeneity of the CFV core. It was found that the impact of <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> homogenization has a negligible effect on the sodium void reactivity effect. However, between different <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> positions, a difference of up to 1 $ in the sodium void reactivity effect was found, hence the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> position has to be carefully considered when calculating the sodium void reactivity effect. For the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> worth in a voided CFV core, the traditional 2 D procedure, could lead to discrepancies of up to 11 % for <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> positions at the top of the core.

5|$|The nuclei {{of several}} hafnium {{isotopes}} can each absorb multiple neutrons. This makes hafnium a good material {{for use in}} the <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> for nuclear reactors. Its neutron-capture cross-section is about 600 times that of zirconium. (Other elements that are good neutron-absorbers for <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> are cadmium and boron.) Excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosion-resistance properties allow its use in the harsh environment of pressurized water reactors. The German research reactor FRM II uses hafnium as a neutron absorber. It is also common in military reactors, particularity in US naval reactors, but seldom found in civilian ones, the first core of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station (a conversion of a naval reactor) being a notable exception.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear reactors, 10B is {{used for}} {{reactivity}} control and in emergency shutdown systems.

40|$|A {{new system}} to {{optimize}} both <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> pattern and fuel-loading design {{in boiling water}} reactors is shown. The system is named OCOTH, and {{it is based on}} heuristic techniques such as genetic algorithms, neural networks, and ant colonies. Each heuristic technique is used to design a part of the optimization process. So, the neural network finds an initial fuel loading with a Haling burnup calculation. The ant colony system optimizes full-power <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> pattern of the initial fuel loading. Finally, the genetic algorithm optimizes fuel loading with the optimized <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> patterns. The ant colony system and the genetic algorithm perform an iterative loop until a stop criterion is fulfilled;for example, <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> pattern and fuel-loading convergence.

40|$|Applicability of the {{modified}} Neutron Source Multiplication (NSM) method with extraction {{of the fundamental}} mode to subcriticality measurement has been proposed. Following the feasibility verification in the previous study based on numerical analyses, its applicability has been proven in a more realistic situation; in a withdrawal sequence of <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> banks during the PWR startup. Subcriticalities with various <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> insertion configurations were estimated based on {{the modified}} NSM method. The subcriticality could be evaluated with a good accuracy even with the mockup experiment where any special treatments for accurate measurement were not taken into account and fur-thermore the insensitivity of measured signals by reactivity changes and their large fluctuations were seen. Based on this fact, we further investigated a feasibility to use neutron count rate data obtained during the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> drop testing, which is carried out before the reactor physics tests at hot zero power condition. When it is proven that these data {{could be used for}} the estimation of each <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> worth, the following reactor physics tests could be performed with the advanced knowledge of each <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> worth and procedures for detailed <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> worth measurement could be simplified or eliminated from the reactor physics tests...|$|R
5|$|Dysprosium is used, in {{conjunction}} with vanadium and other elements, in making laser materials and commercial lighting. Because of dysprosium's high thermal-neutron absorption cross-section, dysprosium-oxide–nickel cermets are used in neutron-absorbing <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> in nuclear reactors. Dysprosium–cadmium chalcogenides are sources of infrared radiation, which is useful for studying chemical reactions. Because dysprosium and its compounds are highly susceptible to magnetization, they are employed in various data-storage applications, such as in hard disks. Dysprosium is increasingly in demand for the permanent magnets used in electric car motors and wind turbine generators.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1886 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, {{but it was}} not isolated in pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility in data storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.|$|E
5|$|Samarium-149 {{has high}} {{cross-section}} for neutron capture (41,000barns) {{and is therefore}} used in the <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> of nuclear reactors. Its advantage compared to competing materials, such as boron and cadmium, is stability of absorption – most of the fusion and decay products of samarium-149 are other isotopes of samarium that are also good neutron absorbers. For example, the cross section of samarium-151 is 15,000barns, {{it is on the}} order of hundreds of barns for 150Sm, 152Sm, and 153Sm, and is 6,800barns for natural (mixed-isotope) samarium. Among the decay products in a nuclear reactor, samarium-149 is regarded as the second most important for the reactor design and operation after xenon-135.|$|E

In this study, the drop performance of the conceptually designed <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> assembly for the prototype generation IV sodium-cooled fast reactor that is being developed at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute as a next-generation nuclear reactor was experimentally investigated. For the performance test, the test facility and test procedure were established first, and several free drop performance tests of the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> assembly under different flow rate conditions were then carried out. Moreover, performance tests under several types and magnitudes of seismic loading conditions were also conducted to investigate the effects of seismic loading on the drop performance of the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> assembly. The drop time of the conceptually designed <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> assembly for 0 % of the tentatively designed flow rate was measured to be 1. 527 seconds, and this agrees well with the analytically calculated drop time.

5|$|The major {{commercial}} {{application of}} samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have permanent magnetization {{second only to}} neodymium magnets; however, samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above , without losing their magnetic properties, due to the alloy's higher Curie point. The radioactive isotope samarium-153 is the active component of the drug samarium (153Sm) lexidronam (Quadramet), which kills cancer cells {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma. Another isotope, samarium-149, is a strong neutron absorber and is therefore added to the <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> of nuclear reactors.

5|$|Uranium-235 was {{the first}} isotope that {{was found to be}} fissile. Other {{naturally}} occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei, releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> (see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control).|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as <b>control</b> <b>rods.</b> Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E
