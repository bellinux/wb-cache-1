500|$|On 4 February 2016, provincial {{authorities}} in Guangdong confirmed that Lui Bo, Cheung Jiping, and Lam Wing-kee {{had been taken}} into custody {{in relation to a}} case involving Gui Minhai. The Guangdong authorities accused them of being [...] "involved in illegal activities on the mainland" [...] saying that [...] "criminal <b>compulsory</b> <b>measures</b> were imposed on them". On 28 February, the three men appeared on Phoenix Television along with Gui Minhai in which they confessed to conspiring with Gui to send banned books to mainland customers and expressed remorse for their [...] "illegal book trading"; Lam, further claiming Gui's books were fabrication, having been compiled from information obtained from the internet and magazines, acknowledged that the books [...] "generated lots of rumours in society and brought a bad influence". Phoenix TV, citing police sources, said the three men showed [...] "good attitude" [...] by confessing and might be allowed to return to Hong Kong within the week while they await trial. According to the Hong Kong government, Lui Bo had returned to Hong Kong and met with Hong Kong police on the morning of 4 March. He requested that his missing person case be closed and expressed that he does not require assistance from the Hong Kong government and police. Cheung Jiping also came back to Hong Kong two days later, and also asked the Hong Kong police to drop his missing person case. It appears that both men returned to mainland China hours after meeting with the Hong Kong authorities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{establishment}} of a planned fodder production in actual climate change represents for majority of Romanian farmers a <b>compulsory</b> <b>measure</b> {{with a view to}} provide fodder necessary. Achievement of this measure supposes the knowledge of ecological conditions, biological characteristics of the annual and perennial fodder species existing in the market and their response at different weather conditions. The choice of a mixed structure of annual (oat+pea, triticale+pea, sorghum x Sudan grass hybrid) and perennial (alfalfa as pure crop, grass and legume mixtures) species allows farmers to adapt the fodder production at the actual climate changes. Such a structure represents a solution both for a good assessment of fresh matter production and for obtaining of qualitative fodder...|$|R

They alleged {{that they had}} been ill treated by the partners at the encampment, and had come off clandestinely, in consequence of a dispute. It was useless at the present moment, and under present circumstances, to attempt any <b>compulsory</b> <b>measures</b> with these deserters. Two of them Mr. Hunt prevailed upon, by mild means, to return with him. The rest refused; nay, what was worse, they spread such reports of the hardships and dangers to be apprehended {{in the course of the}} expedition, that they struck a panic into those hunters who had recently engaged at St. Louis, and, when the hour of departure arrived, all but one refused to embark. It was in vain to plead or remonstrate; they shouldered their rifles and turned their backs upon the expedition, and Mr. Hunt was fain to put off from shore with the single hunter and a number of voyageurs whom he had engaged. Even Pierre Dorion, at the last moment, refused to enter the boat until Mr. Hunt consented to take his squaw and two children on board also. But the tissue of perplexities, on account of this worthy individual, did not end here.|$|E
6000|$|A stormy scene ensued {{between the}} regent and the Duke de Bourbon, {{little to the}} credit of either, both having been deeply implicated in the cabalistic {{operations}} of the system. In fact, the {{several members of the}} council had been among the most venal [...] "beneficiaries" [...] of the scheme, and had interests at stake which they were anxious to secure. From all the circumstances of the case, I am inclined to think that others were more to blame than Law, for the disastrous effects of his financial projects. His bank, had it been confined to its original limits, and left to the control of its own internal regulations, might have gone on prosperously, and been of great benefit to the nation. It was an institution fitted for a free country; but unfortunately it was subjected to the control of a despotic government, that could, at its pleasure, alter the value of the specie within its vaults, and compel the most extravagant expansions of its paper circulation. The vital principle of a bank is security in the regularity of its operations, and the immediate convertibility of its paper into coin; and what confidence could be reposed in an institution or its paper promises, when the sovereign could at any moment centuple those promises in the market, and seize upon {{all the money in the}} bank? The <b>compulsory</b> <b>measures</b> used, likewise, to force bank-notes into currency, against the judgment of the public, was fatal to the system; for credit must be free and uncontrolled as the common air. The regent was the evil spirit of the system, that forced Law on to an expansion of his paper currency far beyond what he had ever dreamed of. He it was that in a manner compelled the unlucky projector to devise all kinds of collateral companies and monopolies, by which to raise funds to meet the constantly and enormously increasing emissions of shares and notes. Law was but like a poor conjurer in the hands of a potent spirit that he has evoked, and that obliges him to go on, desperately and ruinously, with his conjurations. He only thought at the outset to raise the wind, but the regent compelled him to raise the whirlwind.|$|E

The purpose of this policy decision was to improve the relevance of sustainability in the home ownership decision making process. This paper assesses the initial impact of this initiative over its first year in operation. In partnership with the Real Estate Institute of Queensland, real estate agents and salespeople in Queensland were surveyed to determine what impact the Sustainability Declaration has had on home buyer decision making. The level of compliance by the real estate industry was also reviewed. These preliminary findings indicate {{a high level of}} compliance from the real estate industry, however results confirm that sustainability is yet to become a criterion of relevance to the majority of home buyers in Queensland. The Sustainability Declarations are a first step in raising awareness in home owners of the importance of sustainability in housing. Further monitoring of this impact will be carried out over time. ...|$|R

5000|$|The new rector Heidegger was sober {{enough to}} refuse like his {{predecessor}} the displaying of the anti-Jewish poster (he argued {{after the war}} that he joined the Party to avoid dismissal), and he forbade the planned book-burning that was scheduled {{to take place in}} front of the main University building. Nevertheless, according to Victor Farias, Hugo Ott, and Emmanuel Faye, Heidegger implemented the Gleichschaltung totalitarian policy, suppressing all opposition to the government. Along with Ernst Krieck and Alfred Baeumler, Heidegger spearheaded the Conservative Revolution promoted (in the beginning) by the Nazis. But according to others such as François Fédier and Julian Young, Heidegger [...] "called for, not the subordination of the university to the state, but precisely the reverse", and [...] "did indeed seek to protect students from indoctrination by the crasser form of Nazi propaganda". Young quotes the testimony of a former student, Georg Picht:The way Heidegger conceived of the revival of the university, this became clear to me on the occasion of a memorable event. To give the first lecture within the framework of [...] "political education" [...] a <b>compulsory</b> <b>measure</b> introduced at the universities by the Nazis (...) - Heidegger, rector at that time, invited my mother's brother in law, Viktor von Weizsäcker. Everyone was puzzled, because it was well-known that Weizsäcker was no Nazi. But Heidegger's word was law. The student he had chosen to lead the philosophy department thought he should pronounce introductory words on national socialist revolution. Heidegger soon manifested signs of impatience, then he shouted with a loud voice that irritation strained: [...] "this jabber will stop immediately!" [...] Totally prostrated, the student disappeared from the tribune. He had to resign from office. As for Victor von Weizsäcker, he gave a perfect lecture on his philosophy of medicine, in which national socialism was not once mentioned, but far rather Sigmund Freud." ...|$|R
