5|$|A {{long-lived}} fish, adult Murray cod are carnivorous and mainly eat other fish. The species {{exhibits a}} high degree of parental <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> eggs, which are spawned in the spring and are generally laid in hollow logs or on other hard surfaces. Murray cod are a popular angling target and aquaculture species. Often available through the aquarium trade, they are also a popular aquarium species in Australia.|$|E
5|$|As {{the maids}} of honour are {{reflected}} in each other, so too do {{the king and queen}} have their doubles within the painting, in the dimly lit forms of the chaperone and guard, the two who serve and <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> daughter. The positioning of these figures sets up a pattern, one man, a couple, one man, a couple, and while the outer figures are nearer the viewer than the others, they all occupy the same horizontal band on the picture's surface.|$|E

5|$|Earwigs {{have five}} molts {{in the year}} before they become adults. Many earwig species display {{maternal}} care, which is uncommon among insects. Female earwigs may <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> eggs, and even after they have hatched as nymphs will continue to watch over offspring until their second molt. As the nymphs molt, sexual dimorphism such as differences in pincer shapes begins to show.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the fisher lasts almost a year. Female fishers {{give birth to a}} litter of three or four kits in the spring. They nurse and <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> kits until late summer, when they are old enough to set out on their own. Females enter estrus shortly after giving birth and leave the den to find a mate. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until the following spring, when they give birth and the cycle is renewed.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians {{are found}} mainly in {{lowlands}} in the tropics, but alligators also {{live in the}} southeastern United States and the Yangtze River in China. They are largely carnivorous, the various species feeding on animals such as fish, crustaceans, molluscs, birds, and mammals; some species like the Indian gharial are specialised feeders, while others like the saltwater crocodile have generalised diets. Crocodilians are typically solitary and territorial, though cooperative feeding does occur. During breeding, dominant males try to monopolise available females. Females lay eggs in holes or in mounds and, unlike most other reptiles, <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> hatched young.|$|E

5|$|Fred Keenor {{was born}} in Cardiff, Wales, as one of eleven children. He {{was raised in the}} family home, a terraced house in Theodora Street in Roath, a suburb in Cardiff, by his father Robert Keenor and his mother Mary. His father worked as a stonemason in the city, working long hours {{in order to be able}} to afford the {{employment}} of Elizabeth Maler, a live-in nanny, to help his wife <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> children. Although they were not regarded as being in poverty, the family lived in cramped conditions, Keenor sharing a bedroom with three of his brothers in a house which did not have an inside toilet.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} women {{of her class}} and era, Lady Rosebery patronised {{a great number of}} charities. Her chief causes appear to have all been {{connected}} specifically to the assistance and welfare of women. She was president of the Scottish Home Industries Association, a charity which encouraged Scottish women to work profitably from home making plaid or other items of needlework and the like. In this way women, especially widowed mothers, remained in their homes able to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> often large families while still earning an income.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the saxaul sparrow's behaviour. Often hidden in foliage, it forages in trees and on the ground. It feeds mostly on seeds, as well as insects while {{breeding}} and as a nestling. When not breeding it forms wandering flocks, but it is less social than other sparrows while breeding, often nesting in isolated pairs. Nests are round bundles of dry plant material lined with soft materials such as feathers. They are built in holes in tree cavities, earth banks, rocky slopes, and within man-made structures or the nests of birds of prey. Two clutches {{of five or six}} eggs are typically laid in a season. Both parents construct the nest and <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> eggs and young.|$|E

5|$|Male spiders {{identify}} themselves {{by a variety}} of complex courtship rituals to avoid being eaten by the females. Males of most species survive a few matings, limited mainly by their short life spans. Females weave silk egg-cases, each of which may contain hundreds of eggs. Females of many species <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> young, for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them. A minority of species are social, building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals. Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration, as in the widow spiders, to co-operative hunting and food-sharing. Although most spiders live for at most two years, tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25years in captivity.|$|E

40|$|A dilemma confronts physician-investigators in {{the conduct}} of {{research}} with patient-subjects. As physicians they are dedicated to <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> patients, healing their pain, reducing their suffering. As investigators they are dedicated to <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> research, advancing knowledge for the benefit of science and future patients. These two commitments conflict whenever an individual physician-investigator comes face to face with an individual patient-subject. Indeed, in this encounter between two persons, four personae confront one another: the physician, the investigator, the patient in need of immediate help, and the subject who may himself be helped or who may help future patients...|$|R
5|$|In August 1907, MacArthur {{was sent}} to the {{engineer}} district office in Milwaukee, where his parents were living. In April 1908, he was posted to Fort Leavenworth, where he was given his first command, Company K, 3rd Engineer Battalion. He became battalion adjutant in 1909 and then engineer officer at Fort Leavenworth in 1910. MacArthur was promoted to captain in February 1911 and was appointed as head of the Military Engineering Department and the Field Engineer School. He participated in exercises at San Antonio, Texas, with the Maneuver Division in 1911 and served in Panama on detached duty in January and February 1912. The sudden death of their father on 5 September 1912 brought Douglas and his brother Arthur back to Milwaukee to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> mother, whose health had deteriorated. MacArthur requested a transfer to Washington, D.C. so his mother could be near Johns Hopkins Hospital. Army Chief of Staff, Major General Leonard Wood, took up the matter with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who arranged for MacArthur to be posted to the Office of the Chief of Staff in 1912.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August, the Scottish Parliament met {{to settle}} {{religious}} issues. Knox {{and five other}} ministers were called upon {{to draw up a}} new confession of faith. Within four days, the Scots Confession was presented to Parliament, voted upon, and approved. A week later, the Parliament passed three acts in one day: the first abolished the jurisdiction of the Pope in Scotland, the second condemned all doctrine and practice contrary to the reformed faith, and the third forbade the celebration of Mass in Scotland. Before the dissolution of Parliament, Knox and the other ministers were given the task of organising the newly reformed church or the Kirk. They would work for several months on the Book of Discipline, the document describing the organisation of the new church. During this period, in December 1560, Knox's wife, Margery, died, leaving Knox to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> two sons, aged three and a half and two years old. John Calvin, who had lost his own wife in 1549, wrote a letter of condolence.|$|E
5|$|Snow White {{is saved}} by seven dwarfs, each {{named after the}} days of the week and {{possessing}} the power to transform into a rainbow to move {{from one place to another}} (but are only capable if all seven dwarfs are present). The eldest is Sunday, who is a victim of one of Elspeth's spells that has left half of him as a garden gnome. The dwarfs allow Snow White to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> home, though the dwarf Wednesday is initially suspicious. When Elspeth learns that Snow White is still alive, she prepares a poisoned apple and transforms into Josephine, Snow White's deceased mother, with the magic mirror the Green-Eyed One gave her. Aided by Monday, who is turned into a garden gnome afterward, Elspeth, disguised as Josephine, finds her and convinces her to eat the enchanted and poisoned apple, which seemingly kills Snow White.|$|E
