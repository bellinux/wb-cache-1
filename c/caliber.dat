5|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of four 12-inch/40 <b>caliber</b> Mark 4 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The {{secondary}} battery consisted of eight 8-inch/45 <b>caliber</b> guns and twelve /50 <b>caliber</b> Mark 6 guns. The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets; two of these were superposed atop the main battery turrets, {{with the other two}} turrets abreast the forward funnel. The 6-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twelve /50 <b>caliber</b> guns, mounted in casemates {{along the side of the}} hull, and twelve 3-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, Nebraska carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.|$|E
5|$|In January 1937, the Ordnance Committee {{recommended}} {{development of}} such a weapon; two PaK 36 guns were acquired for study. As the projected main user of the weapon, the Infantry Branch was chosen to oversee the work. They wanted a lightweight gun that could be moved around by the crew, so any ideas of using a larger <b>caliber</b> {{than that of the}} German gun were discarded. The 37mm was a popular <b>caliber</b> of anti-tank guns in the 1930s; other anti-tank guns of the same <b>caliber</b> included Swedish Bofors gun, Czechoslovakian vz. 34 and vz. 37, Japanese Type 94 and Type 1.|$|E

5|$|With {{fiscal year}} 1917 appropriations, bids {{on the four}} Colorados were opened on 18 October 1916; though Marylands keel was laid on 24 April 1917, the other three battleships were not until 1919–1920. With the {{cancellation}} of the first , the Colorados were the last U.S. battleships to enter service for nearly two decades. They were also the final U.S. battleships to use twin gun turrets—the s and second es had nine 16-inch/45 <b>caliber</b> guns and the s used nine 16in/50 <b>caliber</b> in three triple turrets.|$|E

5|$|After her {{training}} {{exercises in the}} Atlantic and the Pacific were finished, New Mexico was overhauled and modernized at the Philadelphia Harbor by the Navy from March 1931 to January 1933. The overhaul included the replacement of her turbo-electric drive with more conventional geared turbines, which were made by Curtis. In addition, New Mexico received eight 5-inch/25 <b>caliber</b> anti-aircraft guns, replacing the four 3-inch/50 <b>caliber</b> guns that had been previously installed. After the overhaul, she returned the Pacific to continue training exercises {{and the development of}} tactical operations.|$|E
5|$|As built, both ships {{also carried}} 21 /51 <b>caliber</b> guns arrayed ten {{to a side}} with one in the stern, {{primarily}} for defense against destroyers and torpedo boats. Many of the 5-inch guns were poor in accuracy in rough seas due to being mounted near {{the ends of the}} ship and below the main deck. The ships were not designed with anti-aircraft (AA) defense in mind, and with the development of naval aviation, this was seen as a serious drawback to the class. The New York class was the first US battleship to mount anti-aircraft guns, with two /50 <b>caliber</b> guns mounted on platforms on top of the boat cranes of Texas in 1916. In 1918, the secondary armament was reduced to 16 5-inch/51 <b>caliber</b> guns, eight to a side, as the guns near the ends of the ship were difficult to work in any kind of sea. When both ships were refitted 1925-26, AA defense was increased with eight 3-inch/50 <b>caliber</b> guns arrayed four to a side. Six of the 16 remaining 5-inch guns were relocated higher in the ship to new casemates on the main deck. The New York class also initially featured four torpedo tubes, 1 each on the port side bow and stern and starboard bow and stern, for the Bliss-Leavitt Mark 3 torpedo, instead of the previous two, because of advances in torpedo performance increasing the prominence of the weapon. The torpedo rooms held 12 torpedoes total, plus 12 naval defense mines. However, the torpedo tubes were removed in the 1925-26 refit.|$|E
5|$|At {{a conference}} in September 1906, many of the {{disagreements}} over the ship's design were resolved. The Naval Constructor, von Eickstedt, argued that since the explosive trials for the proposed protection systems for the new battlecruiser had not been completed, the construction should be postponed, to allow for any alterations to the design. He also argued that guns of 21cm(8.3in) or 24cm(9.4in) <b>caliber</b> would be sufficient to penetrate the armor of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral August von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated that for the ship {{to be able to}} engage battleships, the 28cm(11in) <b>caliber</b> guns were necessary.|$|E

5|$|Chikhachov {{instructed}} Andrey Toropov of the Nikolaev Shipyard {{to draft}} two proposals, one armed with 10-inch {{and the other}} with 12-inch guns. Toropov estimated that the ship should have displaced at least 8,880 tons. Chikhachov admitted the fact and presented the two options to the NTC. The admiral himself and the active fleet commanders voted for the 12-inch <b>caliber,</b> which had already become a worldwide battleship standard, but the NTC strongly advised against it. The Navy brass spent April and May 1893 in lengthy debates. They agreed to increase displacement to 8,880 tons and were leaning toward accepting 12-inch guns when General Admiral Grand Duke Alexey resolved the discussion in favor of the smaller <b>caliber.</b>|$|E
5|$|For armament, the Rivadavia {{class was}} {{equipped}} with a main battery of twelve 12-inch/50 <b>caliber</b> guns, a secondary battery of twelve 6 inch (152 mm)/50 and twelve 4-inch (102mm)/50 QF, and two 21-inch (533mm) torpedo tubes.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 eight /75 <b>caliber</b> AA guns in two quadruple mounts {{were added}} to improve the light AA armament. The ships were more {{extensively}} refitted with large amounts of light AA guns {{at the expense of}} the 5-inch/51 <b>caliber</b> guns in 1942, as the attack on Pearl Harbor had shown pre-war light AA armament to be inadequate. The 1.1 inch quad mounts were removed and 24 Bofors 40 mm guns were added in six quadruple mounts (later increased to 40 guns), while 42 Oerlikon 20 mm guns in single mounts were also added. The 3-inch AA gun armament was increased to 10 guns, while the 5-inch gun armament was reduced to 6 guns.|$|E
5000|$|The cannon {{ought to}} be {{classified}} as only a mortar by its barrel length in modern classification, with the barrel length at only 6 <b>calibers.</b> However, in the 17th to the 18th century, it was rather called a [...] "Bombard cannon", since mortars at that time had barrel lengths {{of no more than}} 2.5 <b>calibers,</b> or 3.5 <b>calibers</b> at maximum for long-range mortars.|$|R

5|$|The large <b>caliber</b> {{guns were}} {{designed}} to fire two different 16-inch shells: an armor-piercing round for anti-ship and anti-structure work and a high explosive round designed for use against unarmored targets and shore bombardment. A third type of ammunition for delivering tactical nuclear warheads was developed subsequently.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of four /35 <b>caliber</b> guns guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The {{secondary}} battery consisted of fourteen /40 <b>caliber</b> Mark IV guns, which were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried sixteen 6-pounder guns mounted in casemates {{along the side of}} the hull and six 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, Wisconsin carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in deck mounted torpedo launchers.|$|E

40|$|Background: Retinal vessels {{provide a}} unique {{opportunity}} to study both systemic and cerebrovascular disease. Smaller retinal arteriolar <b>calibers</b> are strongly related to hypertension, whereas larger retinal venular <b>calibers</b> are more related to inflammation, cerebral hypoperfusion, and cerebrovascular disease. Whether retinal vessel <b>calibers</b> are related to dementia remains unclear. Methods: We investigated whether retinal arteriolar and venular <b>calibers</b> are associated with risk of dementia, and its subtypes Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia, in the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study. Digitized retinal images were available in 5, 553 participants aged 55 years or over and dementia-free at baseline (1990 - 1993). Participants were re-examined in 1993 - 1994, 1997 - 1999, and 2002 - 2004 and were continuously monitored for development of dementia. Results: During a mean follow-up of 11. 6 years, 655 participants developed dementia. AD was diagnosed in 519 and vascular dementia in 73 participants. Larger venular <b>calibers</b> were associated with an increased risk of dementia, in particular vascular dementia (age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio per SD increase: 1. 31; 95 % confidence interval 1. 06 - 1. 64), but not AD. The association remained significant after adjustment for stroke and cardiovascular risk factors. Smaller arteriolar <b>calibers</b> were also associated with an increased risk of vascular dementia, yet only when adjusted for venular <b>calibers.</b> Conclusions: Retinal venular widening is associated with an increased risk of vascular dementia. Our findings are in line with previous observations in stroke and cerebral small-vessel disease and suggest that the association between larger retinal venular <b>calibers</b> and dementia may reflect cerebral hypoperfusion and subsequent ischemia.

5|$|A {{battleship}} {{is a large}} armored warship with a {{main battery}} consisting of large <b>caliber</b> guns. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship, and a fleet of battleships was considered vital for any nation that desired to maintain command of the sea.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} Mark 2 {{was tested}} and proven on 8 April 1918, {{and the gun}} was scheduled to go into naval service in 1923. However, with the cancellation of both the Lexington and the South Dakota classes, no guns were installed on any ships even though 71 had been built and 44 were under construction. In 1922–24, twenty of the guns {{were given to the}} Army for use as coastal defense guns along with the Army's 16"/50 <b>caliber</b> M1919 guns. Later planning called for the use of these guns in the s, but miscommunication between design bureaus led to the 16"/50 <b>caliber</b> Mark 7 gun being used instead. As a result, all but three of the Navy's remaining Mark 2 and 3 guns were sent to the Army to also be used as coastal defense guns.|$|E
5|$|An autocannon is {{a cannon}} {{with a larger}} <b>caliber</b> than a machine gun, but smaller {{than that of a}} field gun. Autocannons have {{mechanisms}} to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a faster rate of fire than artillery, often approaching—and, in the case of Gatling guns, surpassing—that of a machine gun. The traditional minimum bore for autocannon—indeed, for all types of cannon, as autocannon are the lowest-caliber pieces—has remained 20mm, since World War II.|$|E
