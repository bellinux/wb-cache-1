The three-axis attitude control system maintains this baffle in direction of the Sun.

25|$|The <b>cryostat</b> {{is a large}} 3,800-tonne {{stainless}} steel structure surrounding the vacuum vessel and the superconducting magnets, {{in order to provide}} a super-cool vacuum environment. Its thickness ranging from 50 to 250mm will allow it to withstand the atmospheric pressure on the area of a volume of 8,500 cubic meters.

The measurements are calibrated against a known standard, such as mercury cobalt thiocyanate, HgCo(NCS)4. Calibration removes the {{need to know the}} density of the sample.

Three different test <b>cryostats</b> will house the modules, which can also be exposed to particle beams for calibration purposes. The three <b>cryostats</b> share a common liquid argon and liquid nitrogen distribution system. The system is rather complex since it has to allow operations of the three <b>cryostats</b> at the same time. Liquid nitrogen is used as cold source for both the cool-down of the <b>cryostats</b> and for normal operation of the <b>cryostats</b> filled with liquid argon...|$|R

25|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of the diamond anvil cell, static high-pressure apparatus required large hydraulic presses which weighed several tons and required large specialized laboratories. The simplicity and compactness of the DAC meant that it could be accommodated {{in a wide variety of}} experiments. Some contemporary DACs can easily fit into a <b>cryostat</b> for low-temperature measurements, and for use with a superconducting electromagnet. In addition to being hard, diamonds have the advantage of being transparent to a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from infrared to gamma rays, with the exception of the far ultraviolet and soft X-rays. This makes the DAC a perfect device for spectroscopic experiments and for crystallographic studies using hard X-rays.|$|E
25|$|Tissue {{preparation}} or fixation {{is essential}} for the preservation of cell morphology and tissue architecture. Inappropriate or prolonged fixation may significantly diminish the antibody binding capability. Many antigens can be successfully demonstrated in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. However, some antigens will not survive even moderate amounts of aldehyde fixation. Under these conditions, tissues should be rapidly fresh frozen in liquid nitrogen and cut with a <b>cryostat.</b> The disadvantages of frozen sections include poor morphology, poor resolution at higher magnifications, difficulty in cutting over paraffin sections, and the need for frozen storage. Alternatively, vibratome sections do not require the tissue to be processed through organic solvents or high heat, which can destroy the antigenicity, or disrupted by freeze thawing. The disadvantage of vibratome sections is that the sectioning process is slow and difficult with soft and poorly fixed tissues, and that chatter marks or vibratome lines are often apparent in the sections.|$|E
500|$|In physics, one of {{the most}} {{important}} experiments of the late 19th century was the famous [...] "failed experiment" [...] of Michelson and Morley which provided evidence for special relativity. Recent repetitions of the Michelson–Morley experiment perform heterodyne measurements of beat frequencies of crossed cryogenic optical resonators. Fig7 illustrates a resonator experiment performed by Müller et al. in 2003. Two optical resonators constructed from crystalline sapphire, controlling the frequencies of two lasers, were set at right angles within a helium <b>cryostat.</b> A frequency comparator measured the beat frequency of the combined outputs of the two resonators. , the precision by which anisotropy of the speed of light can be excluded in resonator experiments is at the 10−17 level.|$|E

2500|$|The {{electromagnetic}} (EM) calorimeter absorbs {{energy from}} particles that interact electromagnetically, which include charged particles and photons.

[...] The angle between the particle's trajectory and the detector's beam axis (or more precisely the pseudorapidity) and its angle within the perpendicular plane are both measured to within roughly 0.025radians. The barrel EM calorimeter has accordion shaped electrodes and the energy-absorbing materials are lead and stainless steel, with liquid argon as the sampling material, and a <b>cryostat</b> is required around the EM calorimeter to keep it sufficiently cool.|$|E

50|$|Typically <b>cryostats</b> are {{manufactured}} with two vessels, one inside the other. The outer vessel is evacuated with the vacuum {{acting as a}} thermal insulator. The inner vessel contains the cryogen and is supported within the outer vessel by structures made from low-conductivity materials. An intermediate shield between the outer and inner vessels intercepts the heat radiated from the outer vessel. This heat is removed by a cryocooler. Older helium <b>cryostats</b> used a liquid nitrogen vessel as this radiation shield and had the liquid helium in an inner, third, vessel. Nowadays few units using multiple cryogens are made with the trend being towards 'cryogen-free' <b>cryostats</b> in which all heat loads are removed by cryocoolers.|$|R
5000|$|Instead {{of using}} dewars for storage, The Cryonics Institute cryopreserves bodies in large fiberglass/resin liquid-nitrogen-filled [...] "thermos bottles" [...] which CI calls [...] "cryostats".

Costs for liquid nitrogen in the newest and most efficient <b>cryostats</b> was below $100 per human body per year in May 2006. Cost reduction is greatly assisted {{by the use of}} a 3,000 gallon bulk tank for liquid nitrogen, which is located behind the building. From this central point the liquid nitrogen gets distributed to the <b>cryostats</b> over a system of pipes. Liquid nitrogen is refilled on a weekly basis and does not need electricity to operate.|$|R
2500|$|The hadron {{calorimeter}} absorbs energy from particles that {{pass through the}} EM calorimeter, but do interact via the strong force; these particles are primarily hadrons. [...] It is less precise, both in energy magnitude and in the localization (within about 0.1radians only). [...] The energy-absorbing material is steel, with scintillating tiles that sample the energy deposited. [...] Many {{of the features of}} the calorimeter are chosen for their cost-effectiveness; the instrument is large and comprises a huge amount of construction material: {{the main part of the}} calorimeter – the tile calorimeter – is 8metres in diameter and covers 12metres along the beam axis. [...] The far-forward sections of the hadronic calorimeter are contained within the forward EM calorimeter's <b>cryostat,</b> and use liquid argon as well, while copper and tungsten are used as absorbers.|$|E
2500|$|The 62-ton Ivy Mike device {{built by}} the United States and {{exploded}} on 1 November 1952, was the first fully successful [...] "hydrogen bomb" [...] or thermonuclear bomb. In this context, {{it was the first}} bomb in which most of the energy released came from nuclear reaction stages that followed the primary nuclear fission stage of the atomic bomb. The Ivy Mike bomb was a factory-like building, rather than a deliverable weapon. At its center, a very large cylindrical, insulated vacuum flask or <b>cryostat,</b> held cryogenic liquid deuterium in a volume of about 1000 liters (160 kilograms in mass, if this volume had been completely filled).

5000|$|A <b>cryostat</b> (from cryo meaning {{cold and}} stat meaning stable) is a device used to {{maintain}} low cryogenic temperatures of samples or devices mounted within the <b>cryostat.</b> Low temperatures may be maintained within a <b>cryostat</b> by using various refrigeration methods, most commonly using cryogenic fluid bath such as liquid helium.
