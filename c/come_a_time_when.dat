His theory of extreme lifespans through perpetual-equalising interventions (ELPIs) proposes {{that the ability}} to attain indefinite lifespans is inherent in human biology, and that there will <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> humans will continue to develop their intelligence by living indefinitely, rather than through evolution by natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Further to {{what has}} been {{mentioned}} it should be stressed that a good well-aged pu'er tea is not evaluated by its age alone. Like all things in life, there will <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> a pu'er teacake reaches its peak before stumbling into a decline. Due to the many recipes and different processing method used in the production of different batches of pu'er, the optimal age for each age will vary. Some may take 10 years while others 20 or 30+ years. It is important to check the status of ageing for your teacakes to know when they peaked so that proper care can be given to halt the ageing process.|$|E

Criticizing the work, Morey (1918) reflected, [...] "there may come a time, and doubtless will <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>when</b> it will not seem outre to represent a great novelist as a huge comic mask crowning a bathrobe, but even at the present day this statue impresses one as slang."

Jones oversees {{the launch of the}} Guinevere Space Probe which is captured by an invading Sycorax spaceship. Although the invasion is averted by the Doctor (now David Tennant) Jones orders the covert Torchwood organisation to destroy the retreating Sycorax ship, arguing that there will <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the Doctor cannot protect Earth and so she must do what she can to defend it. The Doctor reacts furiously to what he perceives as cold blooded murder and tells her that he can bring her down with just six words: [...] "Don't you think she looks tired?" [...] In the episode's dénouement, Jones faces rumours of ill-health and a vote of no confidence. In the 2007 episode [...] "The Sound of Drums" [...] it is stated that the Master, running for Prime Minister under the alias Mr Saxon, appeared right after Harriet Jones's downfall.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} the Dyson sphere {{was the result of}} a thought {{experiment}} by physicist and mathematician Freeman Dyson, when he theorized that all technological civilizations constantly increased their demand for energy. He reasoned that if human civilization expanded energy demands long enough, there would <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> it demanded the total energy output of the Sun. He proposed a system of orbiting structures (which he referred to initially as a shell) designed to intercept and collect all energy produced by the Sun. Dyson's proposal did not detail how such a system would be constructed, but focused only on issues of energy collection, on the basis that such a structure could be distinguished by its unusual emission spectrum in comparison to a star. His 1960 paper [...] "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation", published in the journal Science, is credited with being the first to formalize the {{concept of the}} Dyson sphere.|$|E
500|$|Magnus [...] "adores her {{daughter}} Ashley, respecting her independence and self-reliance – but that doesn't preclude some occasional mother-daughter friction". Tapping {{has said that}} there is a [...] "huge amount of respect" [...] between the two characters, adding [...] "Ashley knows that when her mother says she needs to do something then she says it for a reason. And Magnus has a huge amount of respect for Ashley because Ashley can do things that she can't." [...] Magnus made a hard choice of having Ashley even though she does not have her mother's longevity, and Magnus would outlive {{her daughter}}. In the first season Magnus recruits Will as her protégé. When asked what Magnus thinks of Will, Tapping stated [...] "I think Helen finds him fascinating. He's so idealistic, she sees in him all the qualities that she admires, but all the qualities that she knows will probably get beaten out of him over the course of time. His idealism and purity of thought and the way he analyses things... she absolutely respects that, but I think she also realises that there's going to <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> he's going to become a bit jaded... There are a couple of episodes where there's been this bizarre sexual tension between the two of them... but generally there's just a huge healthy respect." [...] During a Blastr interview in 2011, Tapping further explains Magnus' relationship with Will; [...] "I love how this relationship has developed. [...] "It's been a really organic transformation of Will's character and Magnus. To actually bring somebody on board who, initially, it's all about teaching him the ropes. And then as the seasons have gone on he's come into his own. He's come into his own as a scientist. He's come into his own in terms of his relationship with the people in the Sanctuary." [...] Dunne meanwhile stated [...] "there's a nice synchronicity that has formed between the two characters. And really, they're two people that depend on each other for survival. And therefore, that's where the respect comes out of." ...|$|E

Several of the firms invited to testify at the hearings sent lobbyists that had formerly worked for Senator Max Baucus, {{the chair of the}} committee.

2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to the campaign trail after her debate preparation, Palin stepped up her attacks on the Democratic candidate for President, Senator Barack Obama. At a fundraising event, Palin explained her new aggressiveness, saying, [...] "There does <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> {{you have to take}} the gloves off and that time is right now." [...] In a campaign appearance on October 4, Palin accused Obama of regarding America as [...] "so imperfect that he's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country." [...] The accusation referred to Obama's contacts with Bill Ayers, a founder of the 1960s radical group called the Weathermen, and a New York Times article describing such contacts. The Obama campaign called the allegation a [...] "smear", citing newspaper commentaries critical of Palin's attack. Obama has condemned the Weathermen's violent actions. The criticism of Obama based on his purported relationship with Ayers was subsequently carried on by McCain himself.|$|E
2500|$|... "Harap Alb" [...] {{continued}} to impact on {{political and social}} discourse in Romania after the 1989 Revolution toppled communism. In a 2004 essay later included in his Despre minciună ("On Lies") volume, philosopher Gabriel Liiceanu used a sequence of the story, that in which the Bald Man succeeds in convincing everyone {{that he is the}} king's son, to construct a critical metaphor of Romania's own post-communist history. Accusing the political system which had emerged in 1989 of promoting political corruption instead of reform, Liiceanu contended: [...] "The 'Sign of the Bald Man' is the sign of incipient tyranny, originating with the cathartically interrupted act of the December Revolution and a Harap Alb who has been silenced. [...] But [...] there does <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> corruption becomes extreme, when it becomes glaring for anyone to see, when everyone finds out that the Bald Man is the Bald Man and not Harap Alb. At that moment in time, a people should have an extraordinary chance in finding a living Harap Alb". The metaphor also drew a parallel between the fairy tale protagonist and Niccolò Machiavelli's theories about the ideal prince, both taken as symbols of men capable to act against public perception for the greater good (see Machiavellianism). Commenting on this vision, essayist and political analyst Arthur Suciu argued that the [...] "living Harap Alb" [...] Liiceanu was referring to may have been Traian Băsescu, elected President of Romania during the 2004 election. Another interpretation of the story in relation to 21st century realities comes from Indian scholar Jacob Srampickal. He evidences {{the manner in which the}} protagonist and his fellowship cooperate, and choosing [...] "Harap Alb" [...] as [...] "one of the best metaphors" [...] for interdisciplinarity, notes: [...] "while each participant played his role at the right time, the awareness of the mission belonged always to the hero".|$|E
