50|$|At the Protection & Survival Research Laboratory, {{personnel}} provide state-of-the-art information, procedures, {{and equipment}} evaluations relative to aircraft accident investigation, survivability, health, {{and security of}} passengers and crewmembers during normal operations and emergency events. The laboratory’s research areas are: cabin safety, biodynamics, environmental physiology, medical review of accidents, and vision. This laboratory also supports the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board in the collection and disposition of autopsy data resulting from aircraft accident investigations. Research facilities within these laboratories include a hypobaric test chamber, <b>protective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>equipment</b> and water survival test facilities, a dynamic impact test facility, and aircraft evacuation/cabin environment simulators.|$|R
50|$|Smoke hoods {{present on}} aircraft, also called <b>protective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>equipment</b> (or PBEs), {{typically}} generate oxygen for anywhere from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. The oxygen {{is kept in}} a closed circuit, usually thanks to a tight neck seal. A scrubber system may be present to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide, and is breathable for around 20 minutes. When the oxygen supply ends, the hood will begin deflating and must be removed to avoid suffocation. These devices represent a subgroup of smoke hoods called positive-pressure respirators, which prevent the ingress of smoke or toxic gases by maintaining a higher air pressure inside the mask than outside. Consequently, any leak will cause fresh air to leak out of the mask, rather than toxic air to leak in.|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "FAA uses a variety of approaches, including certifying airplane design and inspecting air carriers, to oversee procedures and technologies that prevent or mitigate the effects of dense, continuous smoke in the cockpit. In {{the course of our}} review, we identified five such procedures and technologies that FAA oversees. They are:(1) Evacuation of dense smoke from the cockpitFAAs certification standards for aircraft design include that smoke evacuation must be readily accomplished. Additionally, FAAs guidelines state that airplane manufacturers may demonstrate compliance with this requirement by evacuating dense smoke from the cockpit within 3 minutes. The guidelines also recommend, but do not require, that manufacturers demonstrate the capability to evacuate continuously generated smoke from the cockpit. However, according to FAA, no manufacturer has yet chosen to demonstrate this capability. (2) <b>Protective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>equipment</b> for the flightcrewFAA requires air carriers to provide <b>protective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>equipment</b> that protects the flightcrew from the effects of smoke. The <b>equipment</b> must supply <b>breathing</b> gas for at least 15 minutes, must allow the pilots to use communication equipment, and must be readily accessible by the pilot. FAA inspections of aircraft include checks of this equipment. (3) Pilot training on emergency proceduresFAA requires air carriers pilot training programs to cover principles of emergency operations and emergency communications procedures. Specific to in-flight smoke and fire situations, FAA recommends that air carriers training programs ensure that flight crewmembers understand the potential effects of the airplanes ventilation systems on hidden fires and that pilots practice planning for an immediate descent and landing at the nearest suitable airport. FAA approves air carriers training program curricula and conducts periodic inspections. (4) Checklist to respond to smoke in the cockpitFAA requires that an FAA-approved checklist that includes emergency procedures be provided by air carriers and used by their flight crewmembers. FAA conducts periodic inspections related to these requirements. In addition, FAA participated in an industry-led effort to develop a smoke, fire, and fumes checklist template and recommendations related to its use. FAA recommends, but does not require, that an air carriers relevant parties (e. g., directors of safety and pilots) collaborate to consider applying these documents in their related checklists. (5) Emergency Vision Assurance System (EVAS) EVAS consists of an inflatable transparent unit that provides the pilot with a window to view their instruments and out the windshield when there is dense, continuous smoke in the cockpit. FAA has approved the installation of the device for several models of commercial airplanes. FAA evaluated EVAS and concluded that EVAS does not provide a significant safety benefit and the potential benefits of EVAS do not warrant the costs that would be incurred by industry if FAA were to mandate installation because (1) dense, continuous smoke in the cockpit is a very rare event and (2) accidents in which dense, continuous smoke has occurred indicate that according to FAA, such scenarios are likely to be catastrophic for reasons other than flightcrew visibility (e. g., loss of airplane controllability, structural failure).  Further, dense, continuous smoke in the cockpit has only once been identified by NTSB as a cause of a commercial aviation accident. The stakeholders we interviewed generally agreed that FAAs oversight of <b>protective</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>equipment,</b> pilot training, and cockpit checklists was effective. With regard to FAAs oversight of the evacuation of dense smoke from the cockpit and EVAS, stakeholders had mixed views. ...|$|R
50|$|Fire: Not {{combustible}} {{itself but}} substance {{is a strong}} oxidizer and its heat of reaction with reducing agents or combustibles may accelerate burning. Explosion: No danger of explosion. KNO3 is an oxidising agent, so will accelerate combustion of combustibles. Fire Extinguishing Media: Dry chemical, carbon dioxide, Halon, water spray, or fog.
