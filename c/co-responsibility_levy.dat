40|$|The present paper {{examines}} the importance that efficient resource use may have for cotton growers {{under the current}} EU policy regime. To that end, input-oriented technical and scale efficiency score for a sample of 172 cotton-growing farms are empirically quantified. The results suggest that cotton farms in the sample are not efficient mainly {{due to the nature}} of the policy regime governing the sector throughout EU. By becoming efficient, the <b>co-responsibility</b> <b>levy</b> will be reduced by 18. 3 % and farms may increase their profits by 50. 1 % on the average. <b>co-responsibility</b> <b>levy,</b> cotton farms, goal programming, Greece, scale and technical efficiency, stochastic frontier model, Production Economics, D 24, Q 12, Q 16, C 61,...|$|E
40|$|Utilizing a {{stochastic}} frontier approach, {{this paper}} examines the importance that input-oriented technical and scale efficiency may have for Greek cotton {{farmers in the}} context of the current EU cotton policy. To that end, a sample of cotton-growing farms in the representative cotton -producing county of Karditsa (central Greece) is empirically analyzed. The results suggest that the farms examined exhibit decreasing returns to scale and they are both scale and technically inefficient. Moreover, elimination of these inefficiencies could result in considerable gains; the cotton farmers examined could reduce production costs by 46. 0 %, by becoming both technically and scale efficient. Additionally, we estimate that if cotton farms in the area examined were technically and scale efficient the intervention price reductions (<b>co-responsibility</b> <b>levy)</b> imposed by the EU for excessive cotton production would be smaller for all Greek cotton growers. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{shift from}} net {{importer}} to net exporter marks {{a radical change}} in the econ-omic environment within which the CAP operates. In the 'Green Paper', the Community's responsibility towards the world market has been acknowledged without drawing the necessary consequences. The proposed price reductions and <b>co-responsibility</b> <b>levies</b> {{may contribute to the}} solution of budgetary problems but have little to offer with respect to the solution of international trade con-flicts and the improvement of the Community's terms of trade. Supply control measures, which are rejected by the Commission, will have the combined effect of alleviating the budgetary burden and of reducing the unfavourable trade effects for third countries and for the Community itself. Final remarks concern the impacts of changes in the dollar exchange rate and of the procedures with respect to the valuation of costs on the budgetary costs of the CAP. 1...|$|R
