500|$|Coconino Sandstone formed about 275million {{years ago}} as the area dried out and sand dunes made of quartz sand invaded a growing desert (see 6b in figure 1). Some Coconino fills deep mudcracks in the {{underlying}} Hermit Shale and the desert that created the Coconino lasted for 5 to 10million years. Today, the Coconino is a [...] thick golden white to cream-colored cliff-former near the canyon's rim. [...] <b>Cross</b> <b>bedding</b> patterns of the frosted, fine-grained, well-sorted and rounded quartz grains seen in its cliffs is compatible with an eolian environment. [...] Also fossilized are tracks from lizard-like creatures and what look like tracks from millipedes and scorpions. An unconformity marks {{the top of this}} formation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>beds</b> {{can tell}} geologists {{much about what}} an area was like in ancient times. The {{direction}} the beds are dipping indicates paleocurrent, the rough direction of sediment transport. The type and condition of sediments can tell geologists the type of environment (rounding, sorting, composition…). Studying modern analogs allows geologists to draw conclusions about ancient environments. Paleocurrent can be determined by seeing a cross-section {{of a set of}} cross-beds. However, to get a true reading, the axis of the beds must be visible. It is also difficult to distinguish between the <b>cross</b> <b>beds</b> of a dune and the <b>cross</b> <b>beds</b> of an antidune. This could lead to misinterpretation since dunes dip downstream while antidunes dip upstream.|$|R

5000|$|In a fluvial environment, {{the water}} in a stream loses energy and its ability {{transport}} sediment. The sediment [...] "falls" [...] {{out of the water and}} is deposited along a point bar. Over time the river may dry up or avulse and the point bar may be preserved as <b>cross</b> <b>bedding.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{foreshore}} is {{the area}} on land {{between high and low}} tide. Like the upper shoreface, it is constantly affected by wave action. <b>Cross</b> <b>bedding</b> and lamination are present and coarser sands are present because of the high energy present by the crashing of the waves. The sand is also very well sorted.|$|E
50|$|The Corda Formation {{consists}} {{largely of}} red sandstone, with very fine to medium grain size, rich in zeolites and iron oxide. Where whinstones are overlaying fragments of this rock are also present. Typical structures of wind dunes (<b>cross</b> <b>bedding,</b> ripples, and grain flow) are common. This {{is consistent with}} deposition in a desert system.|$|E
50|$|In an aeolian environment, <b>cross</b> <b>beds</b> often exhibit inverse grading due {{to their}} {{deposition}} by grain flows. Winds blow sediment along the ground until they start to accumulate. The side that the accumulation occurs on is called the windward side. As it continues to build, some sediment falls over the end. This side is called the leeward side. Grain flows occur when the windward side accumulates too much sediment, the angle of repose is reached and the sediment tumbles down. As more sediment piles on top the weight causes the underlying sediment to cement together and form <b>cross</b> <b>beds.</b>|$|R
40|$|Herringbone cross stratification, mud draped foresets, {{reactivation}} surfaces, tidal bundles, flaser beddings, ripple {{and horizontal}} laminations were identified on the Ajali Sandstone studied. The biogenic structures occur as dominantly vertical to sub-vertical and u-tubed burrows of the Skolithos ichnofacies commonly Skolithos verticalis and Ophiomorpha nodosa. Occasional Thalassinoides and Teichichnus isp burrows of the Cruziana Ichnofacies also occur. Three lithofacies {{were identified and}} these include; the medium to coarse grained <b>cross</b> <b>bedded</b> sandstone lithofacies, Fine grained <b>cross</b> <b>bedded</b> sandstone lithofacies and the mudstone lithofacies. The paleocurrent pattern from <b>cross</b> <b>bed</b> azimuths shows a bimodal – bipolar pattern indicative of tidal process. The grain size frequency histograms indicate both unimodal and bimodal asymmetrical patterns with shifting modes. The cumulative frequency curves suggest traction, saltation and suspension as the mechanisms of the sediment transport. The bivariate plots of the discriminant functions (Y 1, Y 2 and Y 3) for the sands suggest deposition in a shallow agitated marine environment. Intertidal to subtidal shallow marine depositional setting is proposed for the Ajali Sandstone...|$|R
50|$|The Mauch Chunk {{is defined}} as a grayish-red shale, siltstone, sandstone, and conglomerate. The Loyalhanna Member is a local {{limestone}} and sandy limestone at its base, as well as the Greenbrier and Wymps Gap Members. Along the Allegheny Front, the Loyalhanna is a greenish-gray, calcareous, <b>cross</b> <b>bedded</b> sandstone.|$|R
50|$|It {{is notable}} for the {{vertical}} cliffs up to 50 metres high, {{which in some}} places overhang, and expose geological structures such as <b>cross</b> <b>bedding,</b> scour and fill channels and variable sizes of concretions. There is also a sea cave and a massive active landslip, which extends inland for 500 metres. As a consequence amethyst stones, which give the place its name, {{can be found on}} the pebbly beach.|$|E
50|$|The {{uppermost}} facies association {{appears to}} reflect an environment {{on the fringes}} of the sea. Fining-up is observed on 0.5 m to 2 m scales, with trough <b>cross</b> <b>bedding</b> at the bases of units overlain by current ripples. Fine sandstones and green shales are also present. The upper units are strongly bioturbated, with an abundance of vertical burrow such as Skolithos - a fossil typically found in marine environments.|$|E
50|$|The Gilbert River Formation {{consists}} of paraconglomerate litharenite layers. In {{the lower part}} of the formation flasier <b>cross</b> <b>bedding</b> in fine grained sandstone is found in abundance, however a little further up the system becomes awash with volcanic and chert clasts typical of alluvial debris. These then are buried underneath fine grained material once more until a significant occurrence of fining upwards in thin layers shows a sharp change in depositional environment.|$|E
5000|$|Cross-bedding (aka Cross-stratification) - These {{structures}} {{are common in}} rocks laid down {{by the action of}} wind or water currents and in some volcaniclastic rocks. Minor erosional events during the overall deposition give rise to small-scale angular uncomformities. There are three ways a <b>cross</b> <b>bed</b> can be used: ...|$|R
50|$|The Shinumo Quartzite {{exhibits}} {{a variety of}} sedimentary structures. The sandstones of the lower and lower middle members exhibit centimeter- to meter-scale planar tabular cross-stratification and trough cross-beds. These <b>cross</b> <b>beds</b> record north-directed paleocurrents along with subordinate bidirectional paleocurrents. The upper middle member {{exhibits a}}bundant <b>cross</b> <b>beds,</b> clay galls, and mudcracks. The sandstones of the upper member exhibit trough cross-beds, suggesting a more northerly transport direction. The sandstone and quartzite beds of the upper member exhibit an abundance of complexly contorted, gnarly bedded, fluid expulsion structures and dramatic convolute bedding. The beds that exhibit these soft-sediment deformation structures are meters- to tens-of-meters thick. They are cited as evidence for frequent earthquake activity and fluid migration during the deposition of the Shinumo Quartzite. These deformed beds {{can be seen at}} river level in the vicinity of Nevilles Rapid, (List of Colorado River rapids), at river mile 75.|$|R
50|$|The contact of the Shinumo Quartzite {{with the}} Hakatai Shale {{is the only}} {{documented}} unconformity that has been found within the Unkar Group. This unconformity truncates <b>cross</b> <b>beds</b> and channel deposits of the Hakatai Shale. The relief at this unconformity is small, being about 10 m. The Shinumo Quartzite overlying this unconformity consists of arkosic conglomeratic sandstone that contains quartzite and granite pebbles.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>bedding</b> forms during {{deposition}} on the inclined {{surfaces of}} bedforms such as ripples and dunes, and {{indicates that the}} depositional environment contained a flowing medium (typically water or wind). Examples of these bedforms are ripples, dunes, anti-dunes, sand waves, hummocks, bars, and delta slopes. Cross-bedding is widespread in many environments. Environments in which water movement is fast enough and deep enough to develop large-scale bed forms fall into three natural groupings: rivers, tide-dominated coastal and marine settings.|$|E
50|$|The Gentbrugge Formation {{reaches its}} {{greatest}} thickness {{in the north}} of Belgium, where it can be maximally 50 meters thick. It is subdivided into three members. The base of the formation is formed by silty clay and clayey silt (Merelbeke Member). On top of this are e of silt (Pittem Member) and beds of very fine sand, disturbed by bioturbation (Vlierzele Member). The sands can have horizontal bedding as well as <b>cross</b> <b>bedding,</b> and are often lithified into sandstone.|$|E
50|$|A {{foreset bed}} {{is one of}} the main parts of a river delta. It is the {{inclined}} part of a delta that is found at the end of the stream channel as the delta sediment is deposited along the arcuate delta front. As the sediments are deposited on a sloping surface the resulting bedding is not horizontal, but dips in the direction of current flow toward deeper water. A cross-section of a delta shows the <b>cross</b> <b>bedding</b> in the direction of stream flow into the still water.|$|E
25|$|Sand dunes {{migrated}} {{back and}} forth on the shore of the Sundance Sea, creating the 350foot (107m) thick cliff-forming Wingate Sandstone. This formation is composed of orange-colored <b>cross</b> <b>bedded</b> fossilized sand dunes made of fine-grained and well-rounded quartz sand. Wingate outcrops are found capping the Waterpocket Fold's western escarpment. Prominent examples are easy to see near the Visitor Center in the Fruita Cliffs and in The Castle.|$|R
50|$|Brown clay {{underlies}} the dunes, which limits {{the rate of}} seepage through the dunes, thus forming lakes where dune advance has blocked valleys. The lake bed and stream are on Awhitu sands. They are about a million years old and made up of pumiceous <b>cross</b> <b>bedded</b> brown and yellow clayey sands. The lake is dammed by dunes of Nukumiti Sands which have formed in the last 800 years.|$|R
