60|$|I am not now {{alluding}} to such phaenomena, at once rare and conspicuous, as those {{exhibited by the}} leaflets of the sensitive plants, or the stamens of the barberry, but to much more widely spread, {{and at the same}} time, more subtle and hidden, manifestations of vegetable contractility. You are doubtless aware that the <b>common</b> <b>nettle</b> owes its stinging property to the innumerable stiff and needle-like, though exquisitely delicate, hairs which cover its surface. Each stinging-needle tapers from a broad base to a slender summit, which, though rounded at the end, is of such microscopic fineness that it readily penetrates, and breaks off in, the skin. The whole hair consists of a very delicate outer case of wood, closely applied to the inner surface of which is a layer of semi-fluid matter, full of innumerable granules of extreme minuteness. This semi-fluid lining is protoplasm, which thus constitutes a kind of bag, full of a limpid liquid, and roughly corresponding in form with the interior of the hair which it fills. When viewed with a sufficiently high magnifying power, the protoplasmic layer of the nettle hair is seen to be in a condition of unceasing activity. Local contractions of the whole thickness of its substance pass slowly and gradually from point to point, and give rise to the appearance of progressive waves, just as the bending of successive stalks of corn by a breeze produces the apparent billows of a cornfield.|$|E

60|$|For {{two days}} {{we made our}} way up a good-sized river some {{hundreds}} of yards broad, and dark in color, but transparent, so that one could usually see the bottom. The affluents of the Amazon are, half of them, of this nature, while the other half are whitish and opaque, the difference depending upon the class of country through which they have flowed. The dark indicate vegetable decay, while the others point to clayey soil. Twice we came across rapids, and in each case made a portage of half a mile or so to avoid them. The woods on either side were primeval, which are more easily penetrated than woods of the second growth, and we had no great difficulty in carrying our canoes through them. How shall I ever forget the solemn mystery of it? The height of the trees and the thickness of the boles exceeded anything which I in my town-bred life could have imagined, shooting upwards in magnificent columns until, at an enormous distance above our heads, we could dimly discern the spot where they threw out their side-branches into Gothic upward curves which coalesced to form one great matted roof of verdure, through which only an occasional golden ray of sunshine shot downwards to trace a thin dazzling line of light amidst the majestic obscurity. As we walked noiselessly amid the thick, soft carpet of decaying vegetation the hush fell upon our souls which comes upon us in the twilight of the Abbey, and even Professor Challenger's full-chested notes sank into a whisper. Alone, I should have been ignorant of the names of these giant growths, but our men of science pointed out the cedars, the great silk cotton trees, and the redwood trees, with all that profusion of various plants which has made this continent the chief supplier to the human race of those gifts of Nature which depend upon the vegetable world, while it is the most backward in those products which come from animal life. Vivid orchids and wonderful colored lichens smoldered upon the swarthy tree-trunks and where a wandering shaft of light fell full upon the golden allamanda, the scarlet star-clusters of the tacsonia, or the rich deep blue of ipomaea, the effect was as a dream of fairyland. In these great wastes of forest, life, which abhors darkness, struggles ever upwards to the light. Every plant, even the smaller ones, curls and writhes to the green surface, twining itself round its stronger and taller brethren in the effort. Climbing plants are monstrous and luxuriant, but others which have never been known to climb elsewhere learn the art as an escape from that somber shadow, so that the <b>common</b> <b>nettle,</b> the jasmine, and even the jacitara palm tree can be seen circling the stems of the cedars and striving to reach their crowns. Of animal life there was no movement amid the majestic vaulted aisles which stretched from us as we walked, but a constant movement far above our heads told of that multitudinous world of snake and monkey, bird and sloth, which lived in the sunshine, and looked down in wonder at our tiny, dark, stumbling figures in the obscure depths immeasurably below them. At dawn and at sunset the howler monkeys screamed together and the parrakeets broke into shrill chatter, but during the hot hours of the day only the full drone of insects, like the beat of a distant surf, filled the ear, while nothing moved amid the solemn vistas of stupendous trunks, fading away into the darkness which held us in. Once some bandy-legged, lurching creature, an ant-eater or a bear, scuttled clumsily amid the shadows. It was the only sign of earth life which I saw in this great Amazonian forest.|$|E

40|$|Gout (arthritis), is {{a disease}} {{belonging}} {{to the group of}} rheumatoid disorders. As a result of some disorders in the uric acid metabolism, deposition of its crystals takes place in tissues and organs. It causes pain of joints and forming of tophi and tophi in kidney. The limit of uric acid in the blood is 6. 5 mg%. Worldwide, especially in well-developed countries, the frequency of gout incidence is still increasing – more in men than women. The incidence among women is increasing only in the postmenopausal period. Methods of gout treatment are based on a comprehensive approach to patients and include primarily lifestyle changes (introduction of special diets and increased physical activity) and introduction of drugs that act as analgesic and anti-inflammatory, as well as are able to remove an excess of uric acid. For ages, in gout treatment also plant raw materials have been applied. They show a potency comparable to medicines, but usually exhibit weaker side effects. Medicine pays special attention, while curing gout, to such plants as: Aegopodium podagraria L., Harpagophytum procumbens (Devil’s Claw), willow bark, birch leaves, mud meadowsweet flower, sour cherries, but also <b>common</b> goldenrod, <b>nettle,</b> horsetail and wild rose...|$|R
40|$|The <b>common</b> {{stinging}} <b>nettle,</b> Urtica dioica L. sensu lato, is an invertebrate "superhost", its clonal patches maintaining large {{populations of}} insects and molluscs. It is extremely widespread in Europe and highly variable, and two ploidy levels (diploid and tetraploid) are known. However, geographical patterns in cytotype variation require further study. We assembled {{a collection of}} nettles {{in conjunction with a}} transect of Europe from the Aegean to Arctic Norway (primarily conducted to examine the diversity of Salix and Salix-associated insects). Using flow cytometry to measure genome size, our sample of 29 plants reveals 5 diploids and 24 tetraploids. Two diploids were found in SE Europe (Bulgaria and Romania) and three diploids in S. Finland. More detailed cytotype surveys in these regions are suggested. The tetraploid genome size (2 C value) varied between accessions from 2. 36 to 2. 59 pg. The diploids varied from 1. 31 to 1. 35 pg per 2 C nucleus, equivalent to a haploid genome size of c. 650 Mbp. Within the tetraploids, we find that the most northerly samples (from N. Finland and arctic Norway) have a generally higher genome size. This is possibly indicative of a distinct population in this region...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We present {{evidence}} of a strong response to light by Chrysaora quinquecirrha, the <b>common</b> sea <b>nettle,</b> based on studies in large enclosures (mesocosms). This result is somewhat unexpected due to the reported absence of light-sensing ocelli in marginal sense organs of this scyphomedusan jelly-fish. We used 5 -m-deep mesocosms to document light responses and vertical migration of Cquin-quecirrha in both natural and manipulated light fields. Chrysaora quinquecirrha appear to be negatively phototactic; a large fraction of the population always rose towards the surface within 10 - 15 min after the mesocosms were covered to exclude light, and descended just as quickly when they were uncovered. When natural daylight entering the mesocosms was unaltered, C. quinquecirrha exhibited a consistent pattern of diel vertical migration during 1 - 3 week experiments. Medusae remained at depth {{during the day and}} rose to the surface (top 1 m) of the mesocosms during late afternoon. Medusae were abundant at the surface during most of the night When at the surface, the medusae characteristically aggregated in very dense swarms of 30 - 50 individuals. In continuous artificial dark-ness, the medusae gradually increased their numbers at the surface throughout the daytime hours, indicating an endogenous component to the migration. We did not attempt to document diel vertical migration for the medusae in the field, but the presence of this behavior in the mesocosms clearly indicates the ability of C. quinquecirrha to perceive and respond to light...|$|R
50|$|Urtica dioica is a dioecious, herbaceous, {{perennial}} plant, 1 to 2 m tall in {{the summer}} and dying down to the ground in winter. It has widely spreading rhizomes and stolons, which are bright yellow, as are the roots. The soft, green leaves are 3 to 15 cm long and are borne oppositely on an erect, wiry, green stem. The leaves have a strongly serrated margin, a cordate base, and an acuminate tip with a terminal leaf tooth longer than adjacent laterals. It bears small, greenish or brownish, numerous flowers in dense axillary inflorescences. The leaves and stems are very hairy with nonstinging hairs, and in most subspecies, also bear many stinging hairs (trichomes), whose tips come off when touched, transforming the hair into a needle that can inject several chemicals: acetylcholine, histamine, 5-HT (serotonin), moroidin, leukotrienes, and possibly formic acid. This mixture of chemical compounds causes a painful sting or paresthesia from which the species derives one of its <b>common</b> names, stinging <b>nettle,</b> as well as the colloquial names burn nettle, burn weed, and burn hazel.|$|R
40|$|The {{persistent}} {{demand for}} sustainable and eco – friendly fibres {{able to achieve}} high performance materials drew the attention to bast fibres, which, in this regard, represent an attractive resource. They are characterised by their fineness, flexibility, and excellent tensile properties due to the cellulose volume fraction. In particular, the fibre of the Himalayan giant nettle plant (Girardinia diversifolia), which grows in Africa and Asia, simultaneously provides social and environmental benefits as well as attractive physical properties, making it an interesting fibre for high performance sustainable textiles. This research provides an unprecedented investigation on giant Himalayan nettle fibres, currently processed and used in the handicraft, performed in parallel with <b>common</b> European <b>nettle</b> fibre (Urtica dioica) already used in the textile industry. The morphological, physical, and mechanical characterisation of G. diversifolia fibres provide encouraging results, indicating a substantial superiority (in terms of physical and mechanical properties) of Himalayan nettle fibres compared to the most common textile bast fibres. Himalayan nettle fibres displayed higher tensile strength, tensile modulus, and elongation at break with respect to European nettle fibres. Furthermore, the Himalayan nettle fibre is the longest bast fibre known so far. Its moisture content results indicate effective dielectric insulating capacity. The values of moisture regain, inferior to cotton, show that the fibre physical characteristics are not affect by humidity. Treatment with increasing concentrations of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) {{was carried out in}} order to induce changes in the molecular structure, from Cellulose I to Cellulose II, of both Himalayan and European nettle fibres, and to assess how this variation could influence their physical and mechanical characteristics. This research has identified as best result the fibre versatility: the ability to obtain, with alkaline treatment, characteristics of the fibre able to meet different purposes. To make the fibre attractive for the textile industry, Himalayan nettle fibre has to be competitive demonstrating that it can work in technical textiles. The field of outdoor sportswear, where a high level of comfort is required, has been chosen to demonstrate the performance of the Himalayan nettle fibre hypothesising a multilayer fabric made of three Himalayan nettle nonwovens treated at three different concentrations of NaOH. Based on its superior fibre length and mechanical strength, Himalayan giant nettle fibre could be a very promising material for advanced nonwovens where high – performance materials are required...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The author's {{interest}} in the therapeutic potential of the sting of nettles began with the presentation of two patients in his general practice surgery who were self-prescribing nettle sting for their arthritis pain. The publication of these two case reports produced responses from four other doctors about similar cases. Historical and contemporary research An extensive literature and database review produced few references from the medical literature but numerous anecdotal references from herbal and folklore sources of worldwide internal and external use of nettle since Roman times. The author {{has been asked to}} contribute two chapters on the historical and contemporary medicinal use of stinging nettles to a book entitled 'The Urtica Plant'. Scientific background The botany, chemistry and pharmacology of the stinging nettle are reviewed. This is followed by consideration of the structure, chemistry and mechanism of the stinging hairs. The constituents of the nettle sting that are of key interest are the three neurotransmitters acetylcholine, histamine and serotonin, and also three leukotrienes. Pain theory Areas of possible special relevance to nettle analgesia are the known serotonin and histamine involvement in nociceptor activation, capsaicin substance P depletion and thermal hyperalgesia (possibly similar to nettle sting), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) analgesia, and the gate control theory. Osteoarthritis Its clinical features, pattern and variability of pain, and treatments are considered. Attention is paid especially to non-pharmacological treatment strategies. Qualitative study The author and co-researchers' qualitative study of self-prescribed users of nettle sting for arthritis is reported in detail. 18 patient in-depth interviews were taped, verbatim transcripts constructed, themes entered on an Access database and analysed into categories and hypotheses. 17 out of 18 patients considered themselves improved or cured by nettle sting treatment. The findings of this exploratory study have recently been published. Information regarding mode of use, application and effect of nettle sting was extracted to plan our randomised controlled study. Randomised controlled trial Prior to our randomised controlled study all published evidence of the analgesic effect of nettle sting has been anecdotal. This study compared the pain and disability reduction effect of the application of stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) leaf with that of a placebo, deadnettle (Lamium album) leaf. A statistically significant reduction of pain and disability was observed. In addition all other monitored outcomes of analgesic and anti-inflammatory consumption, sleep, and patient satisfaction produced supporting evidence of a treatment effect. There were no serious side effects and the treatment was acceptable to the majority of patients. Conclusion It is concluded that the sting of the <b>common</b> stinging <b>nettle</b> is a useful and freely available treatment for musculoskeletal pain. These findings should encourage further research to determine this therapy's full potential, safety, and mechanism of action. The author plans further collaborative research in this field...|$|R
40|$|The {{papers on}} which this thesis is based {{are the result of}} {{original}} research work undertaken in collaboration with healthcare researchers in the South West Peninsula. Modern healthcare research involves large scale multidisciplinary projects and the Statistician's role In these projects, from concept through design and execution to the production of published papers, is crucial. Funding bodies, and in particular the Medical Research Council (MRC), expect a Statistician {{to be part of the}} project team and the statistical input and expertise included plays a key role in determining whether or not projects are funded and are subsequently successful. The selection of papers concentrates on work in the specialty of Neurology, which forms the major part of the thesis, a trial of a complementary therapy in General Practice, work in Primary Dental Care and work in the Anaesthetics and Histopathology departments in Plymouth. Some of the papers are the outcomes resulting from NHS researchers approaching the candidate for statistical advice and assistance to support their clinical work In the South West Peninsula. Funding in 1997 enabled a small group of Statisticians In Plymouth to set up a Statistical Support Service for researchers in health care across the South West Peninsula. Clinical researchers have taken the opportunity to consult a statistician with regard to the design, execution, analysis and reporting of their research work over the past eight years and, whilst many consultations progress the researcher's work but are not major undertakings, a sizeable proportion have developed into significant contributions to the body of knowledge In the clinical specialty. The paper reporting the results of. Phase I of a trial on the use of Cannabinoids in Multiple Sclerosis (CAMS) has become a major reference work In Neurology and also specialties where pain relief is important, such as cancer. This was a high profile project partly as a result of the nature of the treatment and partly because of the type of patients involved. Anecdotal reporting often suggests alternative therapy to treating physicians but many of these remain untested and. in the evidence-based and cost conscious world, are increasingly coming under scrutiny using a scientific approach. The nature of this particular treatment necessitated extreme caution at every stage of the trial and the candidate was part of the Thai Management Group from inception to completion. This submission also includes a paper reporting the Phase II results and a further paper on chemical markers relating to the treatment. With the emphasis on prevention in Health Care, more research is emanating from researchers in Primary Care and this is represented here by the results of a trial on the use of the <b>common</b> stinging <b>nettle</b> to treat arthritic pain in the thumb, and by work on anxiety in Dental Clinics. The remaining papers look at applications in radiology and histopathology, the laboratory based research on which clinical decisions so often depend but which frequently fails to grab the headline news.

Antimicrobial activity was screened by using macrodilution method. The obtained results showed insignificantly higher content of chlorophyll, caroteno-ids, and proteins in young nettle leaves as well as an increase in the soluble peroxidase activities. Native electrophoresis of the soluble fraction showed the presence of two pero-xidase isophorms in the soluble protein fraction of nettle leaves. The total phenoli...|$|E

The present paper deals with the relationship between some environmental factors (such as soil and vegetation patterns, micro-relief, water regime, temperature and incident solar radiation) and the pH, Eh of soils and solute iron in a headwater wetland in Transdanubia, Hungary. Measurements have been taken in four different patches and along their boundaries: sedge (Carex vulpina, Carex riparia, three patches and two species), horsetail (Equisetum arvense), <b>common</b> <b>nettle</b> (Urtica dioica). The spatial pattern of the studied parameters {{are influenced by the}} water regime, micro-topography, climatic conditions and by {{direct and indirect}} effects of vegetation. The indirect effect can be the shading, which has influence on soil temperature and on the incident solar radiation (PAR). Root respiration and excretion of organic acids appear as direct effects [...] There have been measured individual pH and Eh characteristic in the studied patches. Soil Eh, pH and solute iron have shown seasonal dynamics. Higher redox potentials (increasingly oxidative conditions) and higher pH values were measured between late autumn and early spring. The increasing physiological activity of plants causes lower pH and Eh and it leads to higher spatial differences. Although temperature is an essential determining factor for Eh and pH, but our results suggest it rather has indirect effects through plants on wetlands...|$|E
30|$|As {{regards the}} taxa {{with the highest}} pollen concentrations, Ambrosia genus has only one species, namely Ambrosia artemisiifolia (Common Ragweed) in Szeged region that appears both in the urban {{environment}} and in the countryside. Ragweed occurs especially frequently west of the city. The ruling north-western winds can easily transport pollen into the city. Several species of Poaceae family, namely Agropyron repens (Common Couch), Poa trivialis (Rough Meadow-grass), as well as Poa bulbosa (Bulbous Meadow-grass) over untouched areas, furthermore Poa angustifolia (Narrow-leaved Meadow-grass) and Alopecurus pratensis (Meadow Foxtail) in floodplain and along the dyke surrounding Szeged region represent a substantial proportion in the city. Along the urban lakesides Phragmites australis (Common Reed) is the most frequent Poaceae. For Populus genus, natural species of Populus alba (White Poplar) and Populus canescens (Grey Poplar) are the most frequent {{in the city and}} are characteristic in floodplain forests along the Tisza and Maros Rivers. In addition, cultivated poplars such as I- 273 Poplar and Populus x euroamericana (Canadian Poplar) and its variants are frequently planted in urban parklands, public places, as well as along roads in peripheries. Urtica genus with its only species of Urtica dioica (<b>Common</b> <b>Nettle)</b> in Szeged region is prevailing in the floodplain forest underwood of the Tisza and Maros Rivers, road- and channel-sides and in locust-tree plantations around the city. Urtica also occurs in neglected grassy lands of the city area (Deák 2010).|$|E
40|$|Background: Bioavailability {{of metals}} {{occurring}} in soil {{is the basic}} source of its accumulation in vegetables and herbs. The impact of soil pollution (due to urban and mining areas) on the food chain presents a challenge for many investigations. Availability of metals in a potentially polluted soil and their possible transfer and bioaccumulation in sorrel (Rumex acetosa), spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and <b>common</b> <b>nettle</b> (Urtica dioica), were examined. Methods: Microwave digestion was applied for total digestion of the plant tissues, while on the soil samples open wet digestion {{with a mixture of}} acids was applied. Three extraction methods were implemented for the bioavailable metals in the soil. Atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma was used for determination of the total contents of 21 elements. Results: Significant enrichments in agricultural soil for As, Pb and Zn (in urban area), Cd, Cu and Ni (in a copper mine area), compared with the respective values from European standards were detected. On the basis of three different extraction methods, higher availability was assumed for both lithogenic and anthropogenic elements. Translocation values > 1 were obtained for As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. Higher bioconcentrating value was obtained only for Cd, while the bioaccumulation values vary from 0. 17 for Cd to 0. 82 for Zn. Conclusions: The potential availability of hazardous metals in urban and mining soils is examined using DTPA-TEA-CaCl 2 (urban) and HCl (Cu-mines areas). Our results suggested that S. oleracea and R. acetosa have a phytostabilization potential for Cd, Cu, Ni and Pb, while U. dioica only for Cu. R. acetosa has a potential for phytoextraction of Cd in urban and copper polluted areas...|$|E
