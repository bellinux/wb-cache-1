500|$|After {{the start}} of his {{management}} career, Epstein started taking stimulants, usually Preludin, which did not require a prescription at the time. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr had also taken it since their days in Hamburg. Epstein explained his use of the drug as the only means of staying awake at night during numerous concert tours. In 1964, Peter Brown suspected that Epstein was taking too many pills, as he would often cough at parties, which Brown realised was Epstein's way of secretly putting pills into his mouth without anyone noticing. McCartney often met Epstein at late night clubs in London, and remembered that Epstein would often grind his jaws (possibly due to bruxism), once saying to him, [...] "Ugghhh, the pills". Epstein also developed dependencies on the drug <b>carbromal,</b> a barbiturate-like sedative/hypnotic drug.|$|E
50|$|Bromoureides are sedative-hypnotics {{available}} {{mainly in}} Europe, including acecarbromal, bromisoval, and <b>carbromal</b> (Horowitz, 1997). They are a subfamily of the ureides (acylureas). <b>Carbromal</b> was {{banned in the}} European Union in 1967 {{after the death of}} The Beatles manager Brian Epstein.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbromal</b> is a hypnotic/sedative {{originally}} synthesized in 1909 by Bayer.|$|E
50|$|Diethylmalonic acid is decarboxylated to 2-ethylvaleric acid then {{converted}} via a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky {{reaction to}} α-bromo-α-ethylbutyryl bromide. Reaction with urea with affords <b>carbromal</b> (4).|$|E
5000|$|Fast-acting {{barbiturates}} such as secobarbital (Seconal) and pentobarbital (Nembutal), {{when combined}} {{with one or more}} additional active ingredient(s) not in Schedule II (e.g., Carbrital (no longer marketed), a combination of pentobarbital and <b>carbromal).</b>|$|E
50|$|The acylurea {{functional}} group {{is also found}} in some pharmaceutical drugs such as the anticonvulsants phenacemide, pheneturide, chlorphenacemide, and acetylpheneturide (which are phenylureides), and the sedatives acecarbromal, bromisoval, and <b>carbromal</b> (which are bromoureides). Others include apronal (apronalide), capuride, and ectylurea. As the barbiturates are basically cyclic ureas, these drugs are structurally and mechanistically related to them. The phenylureides are also closely related to the hydantoins, such as phenytoin, and may be considered ring-opened analogues of them.|$|E

40|$|In a {{pharmaceutical}} form also containing <b>carbromal,</b> meprobamate {{could not be}} quantified selectively by classical methods described in pharmacopoeias due to a significant interference from <b>carbromal.</b> Consequently, reversed-phase HPLC methods {{have been developed to}} separate the two active ingredients using indirect photometric detection to visualize and determine meprobamate which has very poor chromophoric properties. Different parameters influencing the sensitivity of the indirect response, such as the nature of the highly absorbing compound added to the mobile phase (the marker) as well as the methanol content and the pH of this phase, have been studied. Two chromatographic systems containing benzoic acid or cinnamic acid as the marker, have been optimized and validated. Good linearity and reproducibility have been obtained with both systems but the cinnamic acid method has the advantage that meprobamate and <b>carbromal</b> can be determined simultaneously at 273 nm.

40|$|An isocratic {{method is}} {{described}} {{which allows the}} complete separation of acetylsalicylic acid, paracetamol, caffeine, <b>carbromal,</b> bromisoval and codeine {{as well as the}} potential impurities salicylic acid, diacetyl-p-aminophenol and acetylcodeine. A column-switching technique was developed employing two columns (10 cm and 25 cm) containing 7 -mum Zorbax C(8) material. The separation is better and faster than that obtained with a gradient elution method. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{through the}} cat {{superior}} cervical ganglion was studied by recording {{the response of}} the nictitating membrane to both pre- and postganglionic cervical sympathetic nerve stimulation. The intra-arterial injection of central depressant drugs to the ganglion through the lingual artery depressed transmission through the ganglion. The central depressant drugs tested were (in decreasing order of activity) : amylobarbitone, pentobarbitone, <b>carbromal,</b> benactyzine, mephobarbitone, hydroxyzine, phenobarbitone, azacyclonol, methylpentynol carbamate, paraldehyde, phenytoin, mephenesin, chlorbutol, troxidone, methylpentynol and barbitone. All were weaker ganglion-blocking agents than tetraethylammonium. The intra-arterial injection of the central stimulant drugs leptazol, bemegride, amiphenazole and 5 -(1, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -enyl) - 5 -ethylbarbituric acid (McN 481) also depressed ganglionic transmission. Leptazol or bemegride did not antagonize the ganglion-blocking action of amylobarbitone or troxidone. The intra-arterial injection of pecazine and perphenazine, and the intravenous injection of barbitone, benactyzine, azacyclonol, hydroxyzine, mephenesin, methylpentynol and paraldehyde impaired {{the response of the}} nictitating membrane to both post- and preganglionic stimulation. The implications of these observations are discussed...|$|E
