40|$|The Sleeping Butte {{volcanic}} centers comprise two, spatially separate, small-volume (< 0. 1 km{sup 3 }) basaltic centers. The centers {{were formed}} by mildly explosive Strombolian eruptions. The Little Black Peak cone {{consists of a}} main scoria cone, two small satellitic scoria mounds, and associated lobate lava flows that vented from sites {{at the base of}} the scoria cone. The Hidden <b>Cone</b> <b>center</b> consists of a main scoria cone that developed on the north-facing slope of Sleeping Butte. The center formed during two episodes. The first included the formation of the main scoria cone, and venting of aa lava flows from radial dikes at the northeast base of the cone. The second included eruption of scoria-fall deposits from the summit crater. The ages of the Little Black Peak and the Hidden Cone are estimated to be between 200 to 400 ka based on the whole-rock K-Ar age determinations with large analytical undertainty. This age assignment is consistent with qualitative observations of the degree of soil development and geomorphic degradation of volcanic landforms. The younger episode of the Hidden Cone is inferred to be significantly younger and probably of Late Pleistocene or Holocene age. This is based on the absence of cone slope rilling, the absence of cone-slope apron deposits, and erosional unconformity between the two episodes, the poor horizon- development of soils, and the presence of fall deposits on modern alluvial surfaces. Paleomagnetic data show that the centers record similar but not identical directions of remanent magnetization. Paleomagnetic data have not been obtained for the youngest deposits of the Hidden <b>Cone</b> <b>center.</b> Further geochronology, soils, geomorphic, and petrology studies are planned of the Sleeping Butte volcanic centers 20 refs., 3 figs...|$|E

For M 3 C 12 S 12, their band structures exhibit double Dirac cones with different Fermi velocities that are n and p type, respectively, which are switchable by few-percent strain. The crossing of two cones are symmetry-protected to be non-hybridizing, leading to two independent channels in 2 D node-line semimetals {{at the same}} k-point akin to spin-channels in spintronics, rendering conetronics device possible. The node line rings right at their crossing, which are both electron and hole pockets at the Fermi level, can give rise to magnetoresistance that will not saturate when the magnetic field is infinitely large, due to perfect n-p compensation. For M 3 C 12 O 12, together with conjugated metal-tricatecholate polymers M 3 (HHTP) 2, the spin-polarized slow Dirac <b>cone</b> <b>center</b> is pinned precisely at the Fermi level, making the systems conducting in only one spin or cone channel.
