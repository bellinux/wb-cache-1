30|$|It {{has been}} also {{observed}} that disordered mesopores are clearly {{contained in the}} amorphous <b>carbon</b> <b>substance,</b> making channels for mass transport from the substance to the nanoparticles and/or large enough space for adsorption of substrates. Compared with similar results reported in mesoporous solids based titania, in which nanocrystals are randomly “glued” together by amorphous but not always mesoporous substances such as carbon, P 2 O 5 and silica [35, 36], creation of mesopores in the carbon matrix corresponds to the utilization of the anion-exchange resin. From high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images given in Fig.  4, the lattice fringe of the nanoparticles is 0.24  nm for Meso-TiO 2 /C- 1100 - 1 and Meso-TiO 2 /C- 1100 - 2, related to the (101) facet of rutile, and the value for Meso-TiO 2 /C- 900 - 1 and Meso-TiO 2 /C- 900 - 2 is about 0.36  nm, related to the (101) facet of anatase [20, 33]. It {{should be noted that}} the (004) facet of anatase with a d-spacing of 0.24  nm could also be observed in Meso-TiO 2 /C- 900 - 1, which are rarely reported in other anatase nanoparticles [21].|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} importance of earthworm {{activity in the}} soil system, there are {{a limited number of}} studies that have examined the impact resulting from biochar addition to soil. Biochar is part of the black carbon continuum of chemo-thermal converted biomass. This review summarizes existing data pertaining to earthworms where biochar and other black <b>carbon</b> <b>substances,</b> including slash-and-burn charcoals and wood ash, have been applied. After analyzing existing studies on black carbon, we identified that these additions have a range from short-term negative impacts to long-term null effects on earthworm population density and total biomass. Documented cases of mortality were found with certain biochar-soil combinations; the cause is not fully understood, but hypothesized to be related to pH, whether the black carbon is premoistened, affects feeding behaviors, or other unknown factors. With wood ashes, negative impacts were overcome with addition of other carbon substrates. Given that field data is limited, soils amended with biochar did not appear to cause significant long-term impacts. However, this may indicate that the magnitude of short-term negative impacts on earthworm populations can be reduced with time...|$|R

30|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} plants (WWTPs) are complex systems {{which include a}} large number of biological, physicochemical, and biochemical processes (Sotomayor et al. 2001). The activated sludge process is the most widely applied biological treatment of liquid waste, treating both municipal sewage and a variety of industrial wastewaters (Aguilar-López et al. 2013; Sotomayor et al. 2001; Slater 2006). Actually, activated sludge systems are a type of suspended growth biological wastewater treatment in which the degradation and removal of contaminants within the wastewater is performed by microorganisms [bacterial biomass suspension (the activated sludge)] (Evans 2012). Depending on the design and the specific application, an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant can achieve biological nitrogen removal and biological phosphorus removal, plus the removal of organic <b>carbon</b> <b>substances</b> (Aguilar-López et al. 2013; Slater 2006; Evans 2012; Jeppsson 1996; Chachuat et al. 2005; Banadda et al. 2011; Gernaey et al. 2004; Nelson and Sidhu 2009; Bakiri et al. 2012). Many researchers have modeled and simulated the activated sludge process (Evans 2012; Jeppsson 1996; Chachuat et al. 2005; Banadda et al. 2011; Gernaey et al. 2004; Nelson and Sidhu 2009; Bakiri et al. 2012; Abdel Kader 2009).

Soil (0 – 5 cm) from plots, which were amended annually with various <b>carbon</b> <b>substances,</b> was treated with water (control) or solutions containing tannins or related phenolic subunits. Treatments included a proanthocyanidin, catechin, tannic acid, β- 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -penta-O-galloyl-D-glucose (PGG), gallic acid, and methyl gallate. We applied solutions {{of each of these}} materials to soil and measured soluble-C and -N in supernatants after application and following extraction with hot water (16 h, 80 °C). Sorption was low for non-tannin phenolics, methyl gallate, gallic acid, and catechin, and unaffected by amendment. Sorption of tannins, proanthocyanidin, tannic acid, and PGG, was higher and greater in plots amended with biosolids or manure. Extraction of soluble-N was not affected by amendment or by catechin, proanthocyanidin, or methyl gallate, but was reduced with PGG, tannic acid and gallic acid. Soil cation exchange capacity increased following treatment with PGG but decreased with gallic acid, irrespective of amendment. Tannins entering soil may thus influence soil organic matter dynamics and nutrient cycling but their impact may be influenced by the composition of soil organic matter...|$|R

30|$|Currently, photoautotrophic {{cultivation}} is {{the most}} commonly-used strategy for cultivating microalgae (as most microalgae are autotrophs). However, some microalgae can grow with organic <b>carbon</b> <b>substances</b> simultaneously. It {{is well known that}} cultivating microalgae in heterotrophic or mixotrophic conditions is an effective way of increasing cell density, as well as lipid content, when organic carbons, e.g. sugars and organic acids, are used as carbon sources (Najafabadi et al. 2015). Studies have shown that some microalgae have higher growth rates and biomass yields (and even lipid content) under mixotrophic compared to photoautotrophic conditions. Bhatnagar et al. (2010) have investigated the mixotrophic cultivation of C. minutissima. They concluded that mixotrophic growth results in the production of 4.43 times more biomass than photoautotrophy if 10  g L− 1 glucose is added. Similarly, the lipid content under mixotrophic conditions was 1.18 times that under photoautotrophic conditions. Liang et al. (2009) studied the growth rate and lipid content of C. vulgaris (UTEX 259) cultivated under mixotrophic conditions and showed that the biomass concentration due to mixotrophic growth reached 1.70  g L− 1. This should be compared to 0.25  g L− 1 produced by photoautotrophic growth with the same concentration of glucose added. Conversely, the lipid content of C. vulgaris in the phototrophy treatment reached up to 38 % compared to 21 % in the mixotrophy treatment. Furthermore, research has revealed that the antioxidant sodium erythorbate (NaE) has a better promotional effect on the growth of Chlorella vulgaris than glucose (Cui et al. 2017).|$|R

Four different land uses were selected: (1) Panicum maximum, (2) Panicum maximum Jacqvr. (Tanzânia), (3) sugarcane, and (4) native Cerrado (control). In each land-use type, soil samples from a 0 - 10 cm layer were collected. The samples were air-dried and sieved in order to obtain aggregates sized 4 - 2 mm. The samples were submitted to wet-sieving to evaluate stability and also to obtain aggregates of different sizes: 4 - 2 mm; 2 - 1 mm; 1 - 0. 5 mm; and 0. 5 - 0. 25 mm.

40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} systems (WWTS) {{are based}} on complex, dynamic, and highly nonlinear processes. Depending on the design and the specific application, these systems can achieve biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal, besides removal of organic <b>carbon</b> <b>substances.</b> Also, depending on the type/quantity of effluent to be treated, different configurations can be proposed being the most common the aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic schemes working in continuous or sequential modes. In common they have {{the fact that they}} deal with communities of different microorganisms which are more or less sensitive to external and/or internal variations of the process conditions. This is a real problem having in mind that usually, influents to be treated are highly inconsistent in flow and concentration being the changes most of the times completely unpredictable. In this way, the knowledge and experience obtained from operational difficulties of one wastewater treatment plant cannot be easily generalized to another. Recent increased regulation over discharge of nutrients to receiving waterways, associated with operational difficulties of wastewater treatment plants, resulted in an increased need for tools to evaluate the organic matter and nutrient-removal capabilities of wastewater treatment processes. However, the description of its behavior requires complex models that involve {{a very large number of}} state variables, parameters and biochemical phenomena that have to be accurately identified and quantified. When deterministic models as the activated sludge model (ASM) and anaerobic digestion model (ADM), fail in predicting the WWT process, alternative modeling methodologies usually known as black-box models, may complement and support the knowledge about the wastewater treatment process and operation. Black-box models are entirely identified based on input–output data without reflecting physical, biological or chemical process knowledge in the model structure. What we purpose in this chapter is to identify and detail the black-box models, also known as artificial intelligent (AI) techniques that are being used for WWT monitoring and control.

40|$|Disposal of urban, {{agricultural}} and industrial organic residues implies an increasing problem {{because of all}} the economic and environmental repercussions involved. One of the most adequate ways of managing this problem is the agricultural use of these wastes as organic amendments. Three organic residues (AC, olive mill waste water sludge compost; MWC, municipal solid waste compost; and PS, paper mill sludge) were used in a 3 -year field experiment involving orange production. The effect of their application on crop production and on soil quality was investigated. Soil samples (0 - 20 cm depth) collected 11 months after the last soil amendment were analysed for: pH and EC, Kjeldahl-N, available-P, available-K, total organic <b>carbon,</b> humic <b>substances,</b> dehydrogenase, phosphatase, β-glucosidase, urease and benzoyl-argininamide hydrolysing protease (BAA-protease) activities. Generally, the application of the MWC and PS increased orange yield when compared to control. Moreover, total organic <b>carbon</b> and humic <b>substances</b> significantly increased in soils treated with all the organic amendments. Organic fertilisation increased the Kjeldahl-N and available-P contents of the soil. The application of the organic residues also caused significant increases in dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, urease and BAA-protease activities of the soil. Significant positive correlations (p < 0. 01) between these enzymatic activities and total organic carbon were found for all treatments. Significant positive correlation between dehydrogenase, urease, β-glucosidase, and BAA-protease and orange yield was also found.

Revegetation was performed with the species Eucalyptus camaldulensis (Euc), Acacia mangium (Ac) and Sesbania virgata (Sesb), in pure and intercropped. The experimental design was a randomized block design with seven treatments (pure stands of Euc, Ac and Sesb; Intercropping of Euc + Ac + Euc Sesb, Ac + Sesb, and degraded area with natural vegetation (DANV)) and three replications. At 48 months after implantation of the systems were sampled soil layer from 0. 00 to 0. 05 m, which evaluated some variables of soil fertility (pH, P, K +, Ca + 2, Mg + 2, Na +, Al + 3, H + Al), total organic carbon (TOC), nitrogen (N) and quantified the <b>carbon</b> of humic <b>substances</b> in the humin carbon (C-HUM), humic acid carbon (C-FAH) and fulvic acid (C-FAF).
