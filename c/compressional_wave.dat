Results are in agreement with previous satellite observations. This 'filter action' strongly depends on the relative concentration of He(+) and O(+) and is therefore sensitive to solar and magnetic activity.

During this period the satellite was located at a magnetic latitude of 10 °. It is found that there are two typical types of waves; compressional (meridionally polarized) and transverse (azimuthally polarized) waves. The transverse waves occur mainly in the early morning hours, while the <b>compressional</b> <b>waves</b> occur in the afternoon hours. The <b>compressional</b> <b>waves</b> exhibit rather shorter periods (40 - 110 s) than the periods of the transverse waves (90 - 180 s). The calculation of eigen mode period using the recent GEOS 2 plasma density data shows that the period of <b>compressional</b> <b>waves</b> agrees well with the calculated period of the second harmonic oscillation of the magnetic field line passing through the satellite. The <b>compressional</b> <b>waves</b> occur closely associated with ring current proton flux oscillations. A bounce resonant condition between azimuthally propagating waves and ring current protons is examined. The resonant condition is satisfied when the azimuthal angular wave number is longer than ∿ 100.

40|$|Many of the {{periodic}} variations observed in Saturn's magnetosphere {{can be linked}} directly {{to the presence of}} a rotating pattern of field‐aligned currents that link the northern and southern ionospheres {{with each other and with}} the magnetosphere. Such a current system is incorporated in a magnetohydrodynamic simulation that has previously been shown to reproduce many of the observed periodic properties of the system. Here the simulation is used to investigate a range of phenomena that can be attributed to the effects of <b>compressional</b> <b>waves</b> launched from the rotating current sources. The <b>compressional</b> <b>waves</b> are found to drive the flapping of the plasma sheet and the expansion and contraction of the magnetopause in each rotation period. Because the compressional perturbations weaken as they rotate from morning to evening around the dayside of the magnetosphere, the boundary develops a strong morning‐evening asymmetry. A fit to the shape is provided that may be useful in further investigation of magnetopause properties, but there is already evidence of the proposed asymmetry in the observations of Clarke et al.

40|$|MErcury Surface, Space ENviroment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) {{magnetic}} field measurements during the substorm expansion phase in Mercury's magnetotail {{have been examined}} for evidence of low‐frequency plasma waves, e. g., Pi 2 ‐like pulsations. It has been revealed that the By fluctuations accompanying substorm dipolarizations are consistent with pulses of field‐aligned currents near the high‐latitude edge of the plasma sheet. Detailed analysis of the By fluctuations reveals that they are near circularly polarized electromagnetic waves, most likely Alfvén waves. Soon afterward the plasma sheet thickened and MESSENGER detected a series of <b>compressional</b> <b>waves.</b> These Alfvénic and <b>compressional</b> <b>waves</b> have similar durations (10 – 20 [*]s), suggesting that they may arise from the same source. Drawing on Pi 2 pulsation models developed for Earth, we suggest that the Alfvénic and <b>compressional</b> <b>waves</b> reported here at Mercury may be generated by the quasi‐periodic sunward flow bursts in Mercury's plasma sheet.

In this work, we present a design of elastic metamaterial that exhibits multiple resonances in its building blocks. Band structure calculations show two negative dispersion bands, of which one supports only <b>compressional</b> <b>waves</b> and thereby blurs the distinction between a fluid and a solid over a finite frequency regime, whereas the other displays 'super anisotropy' in which <b>compressional</b> <b>waves</b> and shear waves can propagate only along different directions.

50|$|During seismic events along a fault surface the {{displacement}} initiates at the focus and then propagates outwards. Typically for large earthquakes the focus lies towards {{one end of}} the slip surface and much of the propagation is unidirectional (e.g. the 2008 Sichuan and 2004 Indian Ocean earthquakes). Theoretical studies have in the past suggested that the upper bound for propagation velocity is that of Rayleigh waves, approximately 0.92 of the shear wave velocity. However, evidence of propagation at velocities between S-wave and <b>compressional</b> <b>wave</b> (P-wave) values have been reported for several earthquakes in agreement with theoretical and laboratory studies that support the possibility of rupture propagation in this velocity range.|$|E

Such materials are highly anisotropic and, because of lack of bracing, can present a large contrast between the shear and compression deformabilities. Moreover, when the thickness to length ratio of the frame elements is small, these elements can resonate in bending at low frequencies, when <b>compressional</b> <b>waves</b> propagate in the structure. The frame size being small compared to the wavelength of the <b>compressional</b> <b>waves,</b> the homogenization method of periodic discrete media is extended to situations with local resonance and it is applied to identify the macroscopic behavior at the leading order. In particular, the local resonance in bending leads to an effective mass different from the real mass and to the generalization of the Newtonian mechanics at the macroscopic scale. Consequently, <b>compressional</b> <b>waves</b> become dispersive and frequency bandgaps occur. The physical origin of these phenomena at the microscopic scale is also presented. Finally, a method is proposed for the design of such materials...|$|R

50|$|One {{of the key}} {{findings}} {{of the theory of}} poroelasticity is that in poroelastic media there exist three types of elastic waves: a shear or transverse wave, and two types of longitudinal or compressional waves, which Biot called type I and type II waves. The transverse and type I (or fast) longitudinal wave are similar to the transverse and longitudinal waves in an elastic solid, respectively. The slow <b>compressional</b> <b>wave,</b> (also known as Biot’s slow wave) is unique to poroelastic materials. The prediction of the Biot’s slow wave generated some controversy, until it was experimentally observed by Thomas Plona in 1980. Other important early contributors to the theory of poroelasticity were Yakov Frenkel and Fritz Gassmann.|$|E
50|$|ULVZs are {{discovered}} by the delay and scattering of body waves that reflect and diffract on or are refracted by the core-mantle boundary. Different body waves types give different constraints on the dimensions or velocity contrasts of the ULVZ. Even though ULVZs {{are discovered}} in places, it remains difficult to map out their extent and constrain their density and velocity. Usually trade-offs between various parameters exist. In general though, ULVZs {{appear to be a}} hundred to a thousand kilometers across and tens of kilometers thick (although existing thinner or smaller ULVZs might fall below the resolution of seismology). Their shear wave velocity reduction is on the order of -10 to -30% and the <b>compressional</b> <b>wave</b> velocity reduction tends to be weaker.|$|E
50|$|Shear {{waves and}} compressional waves {{are the two}} main modes of {{propagation}} of acoustic energy in solids. With shear waves, also called transverse waves, the particles of the medium oscillate at a right angle to the direction of propagation. In compressional waves the oscillations occur in the longitudinal direction or the direction of wave propagation. The wave speeds of these different kinds of waves are governed by {{two different types of}} moduli. The <b>compressional</b> <b>wave</b> speed is related to the bulk elasticity modulus of the medium while the shear wave speed is related to the shear elasticity modulus. In soft biological tissues the bulk modulus varies no more than 10% while variation of the shear elasticity modulus may be several orders of magnitude depending on the structure and state of tissue.|$|E

50|$|Under extreme {{conditions}} such as when cooled beyond Tλ, helium {{has the ability to}} form a new state of matter, known as a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), in which the atoms virtually lose all their energy. Without energy to transfer between molecules, the atoms begin to aggregate creating an area of equivalent density and energy.

A phonon refers to a quantum of energy associated with a <b>compressional</b> <b>wave</b> such as the vibration of a crystal lattice while a roton refers to an elementary excitation in superfluid helium.
