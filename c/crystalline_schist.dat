It does not appear that Darwin was acquainted with this remarkable memoir, but quite independently he called attention to the same phenomena when he came to study some very similar rocks which occur in the island of Ascension. Coming fresh from the study of the great masses of <b>crystalline</b> <b>schist</b> in the South American continent, he was struck by the circumstance that in the undoubtedly igneous rocks of Ascension we find a similar separation of the constituent minerals along parallel [...] "folia." [...] These observations led Darwin to the same conclusion as that arrived at some time before by Scrope--namely that when crystallisation takes place in rock masses under the influence of great deforming stresses, a separation and parallel arrangement of the constituent minerals will result. This is a process which is now fully recognised as having been a potent factor in the production of the metamorphic rock, and has been called by more recent writers [...] "dynamo-metamorphism." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{crystalline}} {{basement of the}} Cheb Tertiary Basin is comprised of muscovite granite of the Smrčiny Pluton and crystalline schists of the Saxothuringian Unit. With increasing depth (as seen from the 1190 mdeep drill hole HV- 18) this <b>crystalline</b> <b>schist</b> exhibits rapid metamorphic gradation, with the characteristic development of garnet, staurolite, and andalusite zones of subhorizontal arrangement. The dynamic MP-MT and static LP-MT crystallization phases were followed by local retrograde metamorphism. The moderately dipping to subhorizontal S 2 foliation, which predominates in the homogeneous segments, is followed by subvertical S 3 cleavage. The vertical succession of psammo-pelitic, carbonitic, and volcanogenic rock sequences, together with geochemical data from the metabasites, indicates a rock complex representing an extensional, passive continental margin setting, which probably originated in the Late Cambrian to Early Ordovician. On the contrary, the geochemistry of the silicic igneous rocks and of the limestone non-carbonate components point to the compressional setting of a continental island arc. This disparity can be partly explained by the inheritance of geochemical characteristics from Late Proterozoic rocks in the source region...|$|E

The Vardar Zone is known as a rift zone but also as a zone of subduction where Jurassic ocean crust was subducted beneath the <b>crystalline</b> <b>schist</b> of the Serbo-Macedonian Massif. Magmatism and mineralizations are of various ages, Jurassic to Pliocene. The main magmatic stages with productive mineralization were generated during the post-subduction period (more precisely during the Alpine orogenesis).

40|$|Electromagnetic {{surveys of}} the Median Tectonic Line (MTL) were carried out at {{the central part of}} Kii Peninsula by VLF- and ELF-MT methods to know {{underground}} structure of the MTL. One-dimensional resistivity structures at eight sites were determined along two lines (the West line and the East line) across the MTL. We found some differences of electromagnetic structure between the West line and the East line. The West line approves the existence of a highly resistive (> 2000 Ωm) layer below the surface layer which is less resistive, being 20 - 60 meters in thickness {{on the north side of}} the MTL. At the opposite side of the MTL, all layers except two layers show low resistivity of about 20 - 400 Ωm.

60|$|In {{studying}} the lavas of Ascension, {{as we have}} already seen, Darwin was led to recognise the circumstance that, when igneous rocks are subjected to great differential movements {{during the period of}} their consolidation, they acquire a foliated structure, closely analogous to that of the <b>crystalline</b> <b>schists.</b> Like his predecessor in this field of inquiry, Mr. Poulett Scrope, Charles Darwin seems to have been greatly impressed by these facts, and he argued from them that the rocks exhibiting the foliated structure must have been in a state of plasticity, like that of a cooling mass of lava. At that time the suggestive experiments of Tresca, Daubree, and others, showing that solid masses under the influence of enormous pressure become actually plastic, had not been published. Had Darwin been aware of these facts he would have seen that it was not necessary to assume a state of imperfect solidity in rock-masses in order to account for their having yielded to pressure and tension, and, in doing so, acquiring the new characters which distinguish the <b>crystalline</b> <b>schists.</b>|$|R

40|$|Red-Yellow {{soils are}} widely {{distributed}} on the mountains, hills, and plateaus in Nagasaki Prefecture, {{located at the}} most western part of Japan, and used as an important agricultural land. They are derived from various kinds of parent rock including basalt, andesite, andesitic tuff breccia, welded tuff, Tertiary sedimentary rock, and <b>crystalline</b> <b>schist.</b> The {{purpose of the present}} study is to investigate the clay mineralogical composition of the Red-Yellow soils in relation to their parent rocks. The clay fraction (< 2 μm) was separated by repeated sonification-sedimentationsiphoning at an alkaline medium after H&-treatment. The clay mineralogical composition of the clay fraction was analyzed by the X-ray diffraction method. Free iron oxides of the clay fraction was determined by the DCB method, gibbsite by the differential thermal analysis, and amorphous materials by the acid oxalate method. Total content of the free iron oxides, gibbsite, and amorphous materials was estimated to be 10 to 20 % at the most. The mineralogical composition of layer silicates in the clay fraction was closely related to the parent rocks. Most of the Red-Yellow soils derived from basalts were mainly composed of kaolin mineral (mostly halloysite) or kaolin mineral and 2 : 1 mineral (vermiculite or smectite) -chlorite intergrade. Small numbers of the basalt-derived soils contained kaolin mineral and smectite as principal clay minerals. The Red-Yellow soils derived from andesites and andesitic tuff breccias were dominated by kaolin mineral or kaolin mineral and 2 : 1 mineral-chlorite intergrade, similar to those of the soils derived from basalts. The principal clay minerals of the Red-Yellow soil derived from welded tuff was vermiculite-chlorite intergrade and mica accompanied by chlorite, vermiculite, and kaolin mineral. The Red-Yellow soils derived from Tertiary sedimentary rocks were mainly composed of kaolin mineral (kaolinite) and 2 : 1 mineral-chlorite intergrade. Smectite was also contained in the soils derived from the sedimentary rocks of marine-origin. The Red-Yellow soils derived from crystalline schists contained mica, chlorite, kaolin mineral, or vermiculite-chlorite intergrade. The composition of principal clay minerals of the soils varied from site to site. Some of the basalt-derived Red-Yellow soils distributed in the northern part of Nagasaki Prefecture contained mica and/or chlorite as principal clay minerals. Mica and chlorite are not originally contained in basalt and also not newly formed in the soil, leading to the possibility that the mica and chlorite is eolian-origin. Thus it is considered that the basalt-derived Red-Yellow soils containing mica and/or chlorite in a considerable amount were more or less influenced by the tropospheric dust. The clay content of the Red-Yellow soils was affected by the parent rock followed by the clay mineralogical composition, regional division, and landform. The parent rock is a determining factor of both type and amount of clay minerals of the Red-Yellow soils in Nagasaki Prefecture. 長崎県に分布する赤黄色土の粘土鉱物組成を,母岩および地域との関連で調べた. 玄武岩に由来する赤黄色土は県下全域に分布し,特に佐世保地域･県北島しょ地域･壱岐地域に広く分布する. 玄武岩由来土壌はカオリン鉱物あるいはカオリン鉱物と 2 : 1 型鉱物-緑泥石中間種鉱物を主要な粘土鉱物とし,地区によってはカオリン鉱物とスメクタイトを主要とする. 安山岩および安山岩質凝灰角礫岩に由来する赤黄色土は多良山麓地域,島原半島地域から長崎半島地域にかけて分布し,カオリン鉱物あるいはカオリン鉱物と 2 : 1 型鉱物緑泥石中間種鉱物を主要とする. 熔結凝灰岩由来赤黄色土の分布は五島列島にみられ,その主要な粘土鉱物はバーミキュライト-緑泥石中間種鉱物と雲母粘土鉱物であった. 第三紀堆積岩に由来する赤黄色土は県北島しょ地域と対馬地域に分布し,カオリン鉱物と 2 : 1 型鉱物-緑泥石中間種鉱物を主要な粘土鉱物とするものが多い. 県北島しょ地域の土壌は,それに加えてスメクタイトを含む. 結晶片岩に由来する赤黄色士は西彼杵半島地域･長崎半島地域に広く分布する. 結晶片岩由来土壌は雲母粘土鉱物,緑泥石,カオリン鉱物,あるいはバーミキュライト-緑泥石中間種鉱物を主要な粘土鉱物とし,そのうちどれを含むかは地区によって異なる. 佐世保地域･県北島しょ地域･壱岐地域と五島列島地域の玄武岩に由来する赤黄色土の中には,雲母粘土鉱物および/あるいは緑泥石を主要な粘土鉱物として含む土壌がみられる. 雲母および緑泥石はもともと玄武岩には含まれていないので,それらは風成塵として土壌に加わったと考えられる. 風成塵の影響を受けたと思われる土壌は地域内に点在し,粘土鉱物組成が異なるだけでなく,粘土含量も他の玄武岩由来土壌に比べて低い. 長崎県に分布する赤黄色土の粘土含量は,母岩の影響を強く受ける. 粘土含量は地域,地形,粘土鉱物組成によっても影響されるが,その影響は二次的である. 粘土含量の変動のうち約 75 %は,母岩,地域,地形,粘土鉱物組成によって説明される...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the crustal {{structure}} of the South Fossa Magna region, where a Tertiary geosyncline is developed, is inferred geologically under some assumptions. The method here adopted consists of two steps; 1) preparation of the stratigraphic profiles in every stage of geological devolopment of the region, and 2) modification of the stratigraphic profiles by the subsequent deformation of the crust. 1) Preparation of the stratigraphic profiles. The early Miocene Misaka and the middle to late Miocene Fujikawa series are the main conponents of the nearsurface crust of the region. They vary in thickness in different geological provinces in the region. Their geologic and tectonic maps are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The pre-Misaka sediments are supposed geologically to have been deposited on the oceanic crust of transitional crust between the main Japanese Islands and the Pacific. These data and assumptions {{as well as those}} listed in A) of Table 2 are used for the stratigraphic profiles of the region (Fig. 3). 2) Modification of the stratigraphic profiles. After the deposition of the Misaka series, the following events took place: i) crustal warping with deposition of the Fujikawa series in the downwarping parts and with erosion of the Misaka series in the upwarping parts, ii) intrusions of quartz diorite stocks of the uplifted parts, and iii) formation of the <b>crystalline</b> <b>schist</b> along the southern limb of the Tanzawa upwarping part. (Boulders of the quartz diorite and of the crystalline schists appear in {{the upper part of the}} Fujikawa series of the subsiding belts). Until the end of the deposition of the Fujikawa series, the crustal surface was de- formed in a wavy contour as shown in curve s-s of Fig. 4. From the observations of the Tanzawa schist belt, we can assume that the wavy deformation of the crust mentioned above is due to shear fold with the shear plane inclined northward with angle about 70 °. Then we get curve b-b in Fig. 4 as the bottom of the crust. Besides, it is assumed that the quartz diorite magma originated due to melting of the crust and the Mohodiscontinuity represents a boundary between two different materials (the basaltic and ultramafic), and that the volume change of the crust through the magmatic process which brought the quartz diorite stocks and through other tectonic process is negligible. Thus, we get Fig. 5 (b) as the crustal {{structure of the}} South Fossa Magna at the end of the Fujikawa time. Fig. 5 (b) is here proposed as the present status of the region. If the method and data used in this paper are adequate, it is suggested that present Moho-discontinuity lies between the - 15 to - 20 km level with increasing depth northward. The Moho-discontinuity shows a fairly strong relief (10 km or more), whose troughs and swells correspond to the subsided belts and uplifted belts originated in Miocene. It is also suggested from Figs. 3 and 5 that the quartz diorite magma was generated from the lower crust in 15 to 20 km depth in the orogenetic epoch. The heat sufficient to melt the crust at such a shallow level might have been supplied from the mantle below...|$|E

In relation to the trees in BP- 3, the average annual increase in growth elements in BP- 1 trees was as follows: breast diameter: 9. 80 – 17. 00 times, height: 2. 63 – 3. 75 times, basal area: 26. 00 - 37. 00 times, and volume: 26. 30 – 40. 01 times. Compared with PP- 1 and the control plot (PP- 3), an increase in growth elements was higher within PP- 2. The results indicate different effects on the increment of the remaining trees in dependence on stand thinning intensity. Apart from a positive effect on the dominant trees, to a certain extent thinning also had positive effects on other biological categories of trees. However, this is a negligible productive effect in view of the fact that thinning at this stage of stand development is a necessary silvicultural intervention aimed at forming trees in the dominant storey and that thinning achieves the best effects on the increment of this tree category. The higher average increase in breast diameter, height, basal area, volume and the higher percentage of volume increment in trees in the first biological position, as well as their higher participation in the basal area increment and stand volume compared to other tree categories indicate that tending in young and middle-aged beech stands should primarily be targeted at trees in the dominant biological position. With timely application of high thinning, trees in BP- 3 can assume an important biological-ecological role of “stabilizer” in stands...|$|E

40|$|Un nombre {{important}} de grands tunnels profonds ont été, ou seront à l'avenir, percés dans les massifs montagneux. Le suivi de l'évolution de la température des venues d'eau dans cinq grands tunnels alpins (Vereina, Gothard-N 2, Mont-Blanc, Simplon et Gothard-AT) {{montre que}} la température de l'eau dans les ouvrages est fortement influencée par la perméabilité des massifs et les circulations d'eau souterraine qui s'y produisent. Les eaux froides qui s'infiltrent à haute altitude possèdent un effet réfrigérant sur le massif. Dès lors, la mesure de la température de l'eau en cours d'avancement d'un ouvrage souterrain constitue un outil de prévision efficace et peu coûteux des venues d'eau. Celles-ci peuvent être très localisées et provoquer une diminution de la température dans une zone du massif ou être diffuses et provoquer une diminution globale du gradient thermique des eaux dans le massif. Une corrélation négative a été mise en évidence entre le gradient thermique des eaux dans chacun des massifs étudiés et l'intensité des venues d'eau qui ont été ensuite observées dans les ouvrages les traversant. Numerous long tunnels {{have been and}} will be drilled at great depths in mountainous alpine massifs. Water inflow temperatures in five existing long alpine tunnels (Vereina, Gothard-N 2, Mont-Blanc, Simplon and Gothard-AT) have been studied and compared with the volume of water inflows. The Vereina railway tunnel drilled in Austroalpine nappes encountered little water inflow. The linear discharge rates vary between 0. 003 and 0. 006 L/s/m. Water temperatures series have been observed in both {{the northern and southern}} parts of the tunnel trace: the northern thermal gradient is equal to 0. 018 °C/m, whereas the southern thermal gradient is not very different with a value equal to 0. 016 °C/m. No special thermal anomaly has been observed at this site. The Gothard-N 2 road tunnel (National route number two) intersects the Aar and Gothard External Crystalline Massifs. A general thermal gradient equal to 0. 015 °C/m is observed {{in the southern part of}} the tunnel trace in the Monte Prosa massif. Positive thermal anomalies have been measured in both the northern and central parts of the tunnel trace. They are due to topographical effects: in this region, the tunnel is situated beneath the Reuss river valley. Water inflows are weak in this tunnel: about 0. 020 L/s/m in the Monte Prosa zone, for example. The Mont-Blanc road tunnel intersects the Mont-Blanc External Crystalline Massif. A water thermal gradient equal to 0. 016 °C/m has been observed on the northern part of the massif, at depths less than 1000 meters. This region corresponds to a low-permeability <b>crystalline</b> <b>schist</b> zone. The linear discharge rate is equal to 0. 008 L/s/m in this zone. A large negative thermal anomaly was measured during the drilling of this tunnel. The water temperatures decreased from 32 °C to 11. 5 °C beneath the Pointe Helbronner. This decrease corresponds to large water inflows (about 1000 L/s) in a strongly fractured zone. A second water thermal gradient (very weak: 0. 007 °C/m) corresponds to the granitic unit which is globally more permeable than the schist with a linear discharge rate equal to 0. 193 L/s/m. The Simplon railway tunnel, drilled through the Penninic nappes, is also characterized by a negative thermal anomaly situated in the very permeable marbles of the Teggiolo zone. In this tunnel, the water temperatures decrease from 55 °C in the Berisal gneissic zone to less than 15 °C in the Teggiolo zone. The water thermal gradient in the northern part is high, in conformity with the weak water inflows (linear discharge rate less than 0. 001 L/s/m). A third zone is observed in the Veglia marbles: it is characterized by a water thermal gradient equal to 0. 010 °C/m for a linear discharge rate equal to 0. 203 L/s/m. The Gothard-AT gallery has been drilled in Penninic gneiss. A water thermal gradient equal to 0. 013 °C/m has been measured over the first 3000 m. A negative thermal anomaly was encountered at the end of the gallery, due to the presence of very permeable metasedimentary rocks with important water circulation. These results show that the water temperature in underground works is strongly dependent on the massif permeability and the existence of groundwater flows. Cold waters coming from high infiltration zones have a refrigerating effect on the massif. Thus, measuring water temperature during drilling constitutes a prediction tool for eventual water inflows. Two cases are possible: the observation of a local thermal anomaly due to a very localized aquifer zone, or the decrease of the water thermal gradient due to diffuse water inflows in the massif. Local thermal anomalies, correlated with large water inflows along discrete zones, have been shown in the Simplon, Mont-Blanc and Gothard-AT tunnels. Such thermal anomalies can be measured hundreds of meters before the intersection of the tunnel with the aquifer zone: temperature monitoring thus constitutes a prediction tool for large water inflows localized in a particular aquifer zone. The use of 3 D numerical simulations allows one to improve the prediction quantitatively, by taking into account the problem geometry, the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the thermal and hydrogeological properties of rocks, and the boundary conditions. The comparison of water thermal gradients at the massif scale with linear discharge rates in the tunnels through the massif allows us to determine a mathematical relationship between these characteristics of the massif. This relation permits one to predict the water quantity expected during drilling, knowing the water thermal gradient. These results show that water temperature measurements during drilling of an underground work constitute an efficient and cheap predicting tool for water inflows. Anomalies due to relief must be taken into account; these can be very important in such mountainous massifs. A 3 D modeling of heat transfer in the massif is, in all cases, necessary to improve the precision of predictions...|$|E
