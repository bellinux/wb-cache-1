500|$|Holwell Castle, at Parracombe, was a Norman motte-and-bailey castle {{built to}} guard the {{junction}} of the east–west and north–south trade routes, enabling movement of people and goods {{and the growth of}} the population. Alternative explanations for its construction suggest it may have been constructed to obtain taxes at the River Heddon bridging place, or to protect and supervise silver mining in the area around Combe Martin. It was [...] in diameter and [...] high above the bottom of a rock <b>cut</b> <b>ditch</b> which is [...] deep. It was built, in the late 11th or early 12th century of earth with timber palisades for defence and a one or two storey wooden dwelling. It was probably built by either Martin de Tours, the first lord of the manor of Parracombe, William de Falaise (who married Martin's widow) or Robert fitz Martin, although there are no written records to validate this. The earthworks of the castle are still clearly visible from a nearby footpath, but there is no public access to them.|$|E

60|$|You {{probably}} {{already know the}} difference between the actual methods of producing a printed impression from wood and metal; but I may perhaps make the matter a little more clear. In metal engraving, you <b>cut</b> <b>ditches,</b> fill them with ink, and press your paper into them. In wood engraving, you leave ridges, rub the tops of them with ink, and stamp them on your paper.|$|R

40|$|This job {{contained}} an excavation and an earthwork survey. 1. Will {{refer to the}} excavation, 2. To the earthwork survey: 1. An archaeological excavation was undertaken by Cotswold Archaeology in August-September 2013 at Land at Station Road, Honeybourne, Worcestershire. The area of excavation measured 50 m by 30 m and was placed to further investigate the features found in the evaluation. Four ditches were identified (A-D), expanding {{on the results of}} the evaluation and providing a chronology for three episodes of Roman activity at the site. Drainage ditches A and B were observed running southwards towards the Gate Inn Brook. Ditch A was cut by ditch C, a more substantial drainage feature on a north-west/south-east alignment. Ditch C was superseded by ditch D, a rectilinear drainage ditch that also <b>cut</b> <b>ditch</b> B and carried water southwards. Medieval ridge and furrow was recorded across the site and the remnants of a historic orchard were observed atop the medieval ridges. 2. An archaeological earthwork survey was undertaken by Cotswold Archaeology in August 2013 on Land at Station Road, Honeybourne. The earthwork survey recorded a series of east/west aligned linear features which represent evidence of medieval ridge and furrow cultivation...|$|E
50|$|By 1910 all mining {{operations}} at Tantiusques had ceased. Although forest has since reclaimed the area, mine <b>cuts,</b> <b>ditches,</b> tailings piles and several shafts are still visible. The mineshaft that tunnels {{into the face}} of the low ridge is the most recent of the excavations, dating to 1902. Most of the mining at Tantiusques was of the open trench variety. A cut along a ridge top on the property is the partially filled-in remainder of what was once a several 1000 ft long trench, 20 ft to 50 ft deep, and roughly 6 feet (2 m) wide.|$|R

50|$|This species {{occupies}} wooded {{areas and}} prairie habitat and tolerates sunny and shady areas. It grows on slopes facing most any direction. The substrate is often rocky, with calcareous stone such as limestone, sometimes with chert. It may grow on amphibolite or diabase. It withstands {{an amount of}} disturbance and can persist in disturbed habitat remnants such as road <b>cuts,</b> <b>ditches,</b> fence rows, and fields. Associated plant species include upland boneset (Eupatorium sessilifolium) and staghorn sumac (Rhus typhina) in Maryland, barren strawberry (Waldsteinia fragarioides), fourleaf milkweed (Asclepias quadrifolia), eastern leatherwood (Dirca palustris), and prairie trillium (Trillium recurvatum) in Missouri, upland bentgrass (Agrostis perennans), orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata), mountain oatgrass (Danthonia compressa), Philadelphia lily (Lilium philadelphicum), timothy-grass (Phleum pratense), three-toothed cinquefoil (Sibbaldiopsis tridentata), and self-heal (Prunella vulgaris) in North Carolina, eastern green violet (Hybanthus concolor), American bladdernut (Staphylea trifolia), and yellow horse gentian (Triosteum angustifolium) in Pennsylvania, and barrelhead gayfeather (Liatris cylindracea), Chinese bushclover (Lespedeza cuneata), smooth aster (Symphyotrichum laeve), eastern smooth beardtongue (Penstemon laevigatus), downy skullcap (Scutellaria incana), and hoary puccoon (Lithospermum canescens) in Tennessee.|$|R

50|$|The {{landscape}} is largely flat {{along the line}} of the river. This is known as the Minsmere Level, an area of drained and re-flooded marshland with underlying alluvial geology. The area to the south of the Minsmere New <b>Cut</b> drainage <b>ditch,</b> built in 1812, is used as grazing marsh. To the north the wetland areas are flooded and managed as part of the RSPB's habitat management strategy for its Minsmere reserve. This area includes drier areas of sandlings, including areas of mixed woodland rising up to 20 metres above sea level on sandy ridges.|$|R
5000|$|In 1611, Sir Thomas Dale, {{according}} to a method he had learned while campaigning in Holland, <b>cut</b> a <b>ditch</b> across a portion of land behind town connecting {{two parts of the}} James River. It became known as [...] "Dale's Dutch Gap". It was a way to protect the rear of the town from possible attack and shorten the distance upriver. This length of the James River had broad, meandering stretches between Drewry's Bluff, where the river turns east into the coastal plain, and the confluence of the Appomattox River with the James below Bermuda Hundred.|$|R
5000|$|Originally Morse {{decided to}} lay the wire underground, and asked Ezra Cornell {{to lay the}} line using a special cable-laying plow that Cornell developed. Wire began to be laid in Baltimore on October 21, 1843. Cornell's plow was pulled by eight mules, and <b>cut</b> a <b>ditch</b> two inches wide and twenty inches deep, laid a pipe with the wires, and reburied the pipe, in an {{integrated}} operation. [...] But the project was stopped after 15 km of wire was laid because the line was failing. Morse learned that Cooke and Wheatstone in England were now using poles for their lines, {{and he decided to}} follow that lead.|$|R

But he saw with surprise those of the roots which had not been cut, go down behind {{the slope of the}} ditch to keep out of the light, go under the ditch, and into the field again."

50|$|At Antiville, in a marshy area {{beside a}} {{tributary}} of the River Larne, a rectangular house and souterrain were discovered enclosed by a shallow <b>ditch</b> <b>cut</b> through the peat with a slight bank on the inner side. Eventually this was interpreted, not as a ringfort enclosure, but a means of draining excess water from the site. Radiocarbon dates from the supposed ringfort at Antiville were 544-644 AD and 695-936 AD.|$|R

50|$|Compared with ditches, tunnels had the {{important}} advantage {{that the water}} flowing through them underground could not freeze up. The tunnels were laid primarily to short <b>cut</b> the long <b>ditch</b> runs around mountains. Such cuts also produced a steeper incline (shorter distances descending the same height difference have a steeper slope). This raised the flow velocity and hence the hydraulic capacity of the watercourse. The disadvantage of tunnels was the high investment cost of building them.|$|R
50|$|In 1875 Gleason became {{interested}} in a canal project to connect Indian River with Lake Washington. He proposed to rechannel and deepen Eau Gallie's Elbow Creek and extend the waterway to Lake Washington. The state's payment for this work was set at $4000 plus 4000 acre for every mile (10 km² per km) of canal constructed. This project never materialized, however a drainage canal was <b>cut</b> (the Hopkins <b>ditch)</b> along this route, named after its promoter George W. Hopkins.|$|R
