40|$|The Model Quality Report in Business Statistics {{project was}} set up to develop a {{detailed}} description of the methods for assessing the quality of surveys, with particular application in the context of business surveys, and then to apply these methods in some example surveys to evaluate their quality. The work was specified and initiated by Eurostat following on from the Working Group on Quality of Business Statsitics. It was funded by Eurostat under SUP-COM 1997, lot 6, and has been undertaken by a consortium of the UK Office for National Statistics, Statistics Sweden, the University of Southampton and the University of Bath, with the Office for National Statistics managing the contract. The report is divided into four volumes, of which this is the first. This volume deals with the theory and methods for assessing quality in business surveys in nine chapters following the survey process through its various stages in order. These fall into three parts, one dealing with sampling errors, one with a variety of non-sampling errors, and one covering coherence and <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>statistics.</b> Other volumes of the report contain: • a comparison of the software methods and packages available for variance estimation in sample surveys (volume II); • example assessments of quality for an annual and a monthly business survey from Sweden and the UK (volume III); • guidelines for and experiences of implementing the methods (volume IV).

40|$|BACKGROUND:Heart {{failure is}} {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{listed as the}} underlying cause of death (UCD) on death certificates, thus compromising the accuracy and <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> mortality <b>statistics.</b> Statistical redistribution <b>of</b> the UCD {{has been used to}} examine the effect of misclassification of the UCD attributed to heart failure, but sex- and race-specific redistribution of deaths on coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality in the United States has not been examined. METHODS:We used coarsened exact matching to infer the UCD of vital records with heart failure as the UCD from 1999 to 2010 for decedents 55 years old and older from states encompassing regions under surveillance by the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, and North Carolina). Records with heart failure as the UCD were matched on decedent characteristics (five-year age groups, sex, race, education, year of death, and state) to records with heart failure listed among the multiple causes of death. Each heart failure death was then redistributed to plausible UCDs proportional to the frequency among matched records. RESULTS:After redistribution the proportion of deaths increased for CHD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertensive heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, P< 0. 001. The percent increase in CHD mortality after redistribution was the highest in Mississippi (12 %) and lowest in Maryland (1. 6 %), with variations by year, race, and sex. Redistribution proportions for CHD were similar to CHD death classification by a panel of expert reviewers in the ARIC study.

40|$|External {{statistics}} – specifically {{balance of}} payments and international investment position statistics – are among the primary statistics on which policy-making bodies and markets rely {{as a basis for}} their decisions in globalised economies. Monitoring and enhancing data quality in the context of rapidly changing economies impose heavy constraints on compilers of these statistics. As it becomes increasingly important worldwide to adhere to a set of international statistical standards in order to ensure the <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>statistics,</b> the elaboration of meaningful EU/ euro area aggregates hinges critically on attaining a high degree of homogeneity across countries’ contributions. In addition to offering their own value for analysis, the euro area external statistics are the main source for the compilation of the rest-of-the-world account in the quarterly euro area (financial and nonfinancial) accounts. Bearing this in mind, a lot has been achieved since the inception of the euro area to harmonise concepts and definitions in line with international statistical standards, to review the data collection and compilation systems, as well as to enhance the overall data quality. However, asymmetries 1 both across euro area countries and with counterparts elsewhere still need to be overcome. Additionally, new challenges lie ahead for compilers of statistics, with the steady process of globalisation and the increasing role of financial innovation (in terms of both new instruments and new institutional vehicles) observed in financial markets. While the compilation of euro area statistics continues to be based on country contributions, which are mostly derived from national collection systems in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, common tools are built up and maintained by the European Central Bank and national compilers. In particular, the Centralised Securities Database is playing a pivotal role in the move towards security-by-security reporting and should greatly enhance the quality of security-related information, i. e. portfolio investment flows, stocks and income. The tremendous work of European statisticians towards producing harmonised euro area statistics that are fit for purpose has also benefited statisticians elsewhere and is playing {{an important role in the}} current updating of international standards (the 1993 System of National Accounts and the International Monetary Fund’s Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition). Statisticians have worked in close cooperation in various European fora to clarify concepts and identify best practices with a view to enhancing data quality and reducing the reporting burden. This paper aims to make this experience widely available. ...|$|E

ISI's citation indexes, now regrouped under the Web of Science (WoS), were the major sources of bibliometric data until 2004, when Scopus was launched by the publisher Reed Elsevier. For those who perform bibliometric analyses and comparisons of countries or institutions, {{the existence of these}} two major databases raises the important question <b>of</b> the <b>comparability</b> and stability <b>of</b> <b>statistics</b> obtained from different data sources. This paper uses macro-level bibliometric indicators to compare results obtained from the WoS and Scopus. It shows that the correlations between the measures obtained with both databases for the number of papers and the number of citations received by countries, as well as for their ranks, are extremely high (R 2 >. 99). There is also a very high correlation when countries' papers are broken down by field. The paper thus provides evidence that indicators of scientific production and citations at the country level are stable and largely independent of the database. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|<b>Statistics</b> <b>of</b> {{research}} and development (R&D) {{is one of the}} youngest branches <b>of</b> economic <b>statistics</b> in Russia and was developed {{under the influence of the}} centralized planning system and financing. Under the conditions of the transition to a market economy, R&D policy cannot be re-organized without a comprehensive evaluation of input and output of the national R&D system. This is why a radical revision <b>of</b> <b>statistics</b> becomes a crucial component for the transformation of the R&D system and the background for the development and implementation of a new R&D policy aimed at maintaining basic research potential. This paper is devoted to the problems <b>of</b> R&D <b>statistics</b> in Russia, its applicability for estimating basic {{research and}} <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> data. The perspectives <b>of</b> Russian R&D <b>statistics,</b> for example, in connection with implementing international statistical standards, is also the focus of this paper...|$|R
40|$|The Australian Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Statistics</b> has {{conducted}} numerous surveys {{that are used}} to analyse poverty and the distribution of income amongst Australian households. Confidentialised unit record data for those surveys held since 1975 are available for the use and scrutiny of researchers. Recently, concerns have arisen over the reliability of these data to represent the circumstances of the population, and especially changes therein over time. This paper examines the quality and inter-temporal <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> these survey data by comparing aggregates derived from the surveys to external data such as official population estimates, labour force data, the National Accounts and administrative data. We summarise the major changes to the survey data in an Appendix. Issues discussed include mis-reporting of income, and differences in scope, weighting procedures, definitions and collection methodology. The analysis suggests that uncritical use of the data may give rise to flawed estimates of the extent of poverty and inequality in Australia and how these have changed over time. There is scope to improve the <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> the survey data, and the SPRC is pursuing this task in partnership with the ABS...|$|R

40|$|The Model State Vital Statistics Act is a {{document}} {{designed to be}} used by State Registrars <b>of</b> Vital <b>Statistics</b> and State Legislators when considering revision <b>of</b> the Vital <b>Statistics</b> laws. The main objectives of the 1977 Revision of the Model Act are: (1) To incorporate current social customs and practices and current technology into the policies and Procedures <b>of</b> the vital <b>statistics</b> system in the various States; (2) to promote the uniformity of these policies and procedures to the end that all vital records will be readily acceptable in all places as prima facie evidence of the facts therein recorded: (3) to enhance the level <b>of</b> <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> vital <b>statistics</b> data among the various States; and (4) to minimize duplication within the vital statistics system and thereby achieve maximum administrative economy. The historical philosophy <b>of</b> the vital <b>statistics</b> systems in the United States is that vital events be registered only in the State in which they occur. This concept is maintained in this Revision of the Model Act. The jurisdiction of the State Registrar extends only to boundaries of his State and standards for registration may be set and enforced only for those events occurring within those boundaries. This is a very important concept in maintaining the validity of vital records in their use for legal purposes. If it is to be respected, the appropriate procedures for recording birth and death information for United States citizens born or dying in foreign countries and certification of birth information for aliens adopted by United States citizens must continue to be the responsibility of those Federal Agencies which retain jurisdiction over recording these events. While this revision of the Model Act does not constitute an abrupt departure from earlier Model Vital Statistics Acts, there are several modifications that should be noted. The most significant change relates to the establishment of a centralized system for the collection, processing, registration and certification of vital records in each State, whereby all vital events are reported directly to the State Office <b>of</b> Vital <b>Statistics.</b> However, the Model Act contains authorization for local offices to perform those functions the State Registrar may direct, including the receipt and processing of vital records and the issuance of certified copies, when such offices can be shown to be an aid to efficient and effective operation of the system. The Model Act further provides for the options of allowing such local offices to work with records only for their designated geographic area or to be given access to the entire State file and allowing them to issue certified copies with- out regard to where the event occurred within the State. The important concept, however, is that these offices are part of the State Office <b>of</b> Vital <b>Statistics</b> and are under the direct control of the State Registrar. "May 1978.
