40|$|This is an {{overview}} of the cutaneous porphyrias. It is a narrative review based on the published literature and my personal experience; it is not based on a formal systematic search of the literature. The cutaneous porphyrias are a diverse group of conditions due to inherited or acquired enzyme defects in the porphyrin–haem biosynthetic pathway. All the cutaneous porphyrias can have (either {{as a consequence of the}} porphyria or as part of the cause of the porphyria) involvement of other organs as well as the skin. The single commonest <b>cutaneous</b> <b>porphyria</b> in most parts of the world is acquired porphyria cutanea tarda, which is usually due to chronic liver disease and liver iron overload. The next most common <b>cutaneous</b> <b>porphyria,</b> erythropoietic protoporphyria, is an inherited disorder in which the accumulation of bile-excreted protoporphyrin can cause gallstones and, rarely, liver disease. Some of the porphyrias that cause blistering (usually bullae) and fragility (clinically and histologically identical to porphyria cutanea tarda) can also be associated with acute neurovisceral porphyria attacks, particularly variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria. Management of porphyria cutanea tarda mainly consists of visible-light photoprotection measures while awaiting the effects of treating the underlying liver disease (if possible) and treatments to reduce serum iron and porphyrin levels. In erythropoietic protoporphyria, the underlying cause can be resolved only with a bone marrow transplant (which is rarely justifiable in this condition), so management consists particularly of visible-light photoprotection and, in some countries, narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy. Afamelanotide is a promising and newly available treatment for erythropoietic protoporphyria and has been approved in Europe since 2014...|$|E
40|$|The porphyrias {{comprise}} {{a group of}} disorders of the haem biosynthesis pathway that can present with acute neurovisceral symptoms, skin lesions or both. Acute porphyrias present with severe abdominal pain, confusion and seizures which may be life-threatening. Specific treatment with haem preparations should be instituted {{as soon as possible}} following confirmation of increased excretion of porphobilinogen in the urine. Supportive treatment includes opiate analgesia, monitoring for and treating complications such as hypertension and hyponatraemia. Follow-up should include counselling on lifestyle modification involving avoidance of alcohol, smoking and known porphyrogenic drugs and diet. Identification and counselling of at risk relatives is essential. The <b>cutaneous</b> <b>porphyrias</b> result from porphyrin-induced photosensitivity and can present with either acute photosensitivity or skin fragility and blisters. All <b>cutaneous</b> <b>porphyrias</b> can be alleviated by avoidance of sunlight. Treatment of erythropoietic protoporphyria involves administering large doses of beta-carotene, which may improve tolerance to sunlight.

50|$|Clinically, {{patients}} affected with HCP present {{similarly to}} those with other acute porphyrias, such as acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) and variegate porphyria (VP).

40|$|Hepatoerythropoietic {{porphyria}} is {{a severe}} <b>cutaneous</b> <b>porphyria</b> caused by deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase {{and is considered}} to be the homozygous form of familial (type II) porphyria cutanea tarda. To elucidate further the relation between these conditions, we studied five Spanish families with hepatoerythropoietic porphyria and nine unrelated Spanish patients with familial porphyria cutanea tarda. Immunoreactive and catalytic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase was decreased by greater than 95 % in the five patients with hepatoerythropoietic porphyria. Hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity was decreased to 22 % of normal. Four patients were homozygous for a mutation (G 281 E) originally identified in a Tunisian family; the fifth patient was a compound heterozygote for this mutation. The calculated carrier frequency for G 281 E in Spain is one in 1800. None of the nine familial porphyria cutanea tarda patients carried the G 281 E mutation. However, one G 281 E heterozygote in a family with hepatoerythropoietic porphyria had overt porphyria cutanea tarda. These findings suggest that the G 281 E mutation is functionally less severe than erythrocyte measurements indicate, that its clinical penetrance is very low in heterozygotes, and that, for this particular mutation, hepatoerythropoietic porphyria is the homozygous form of familial porphyria cutanea tarda...|$|E
40|$|Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a <b>cutaneous</b> <b>porphyria</b> with {{sporadic}} (type 1) {{and familial}} (type 2) subtypes, both resulting from decreased hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) activity.

We investigated the association between PCT and variants in CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 A 2 and CYP 2 E 1, and the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) genes, GSTM 1 and GSTT 1. PCT diagnosis was based on urinary or plasma porphyrin profiles. Patients were classified as type 1 or 2 PCT based on UROD mutation analysis. The CYP 1 A 2 * 1 F promoter A allele frequency was significantly higher (P < 0. 022) and the A/A genotype frequency marginally higher in PCT patients overall (P < 0. 057), with the A/A genotype significantly more common in type 1 PCT (P < 0. 043). The presence of the wild-type GSTM 1 allele also was associated significantly with PCT (P < 0. 019). Neither hemochromatosis (HFE) mutations, tobacco smoking, hepatitis C and HIV infection, ethanol consumption, nor estrogen use were associated with these allelic variants. Age at onset was significantly lower in type 2 PCT patients (P < 0. 001), as observed previously.

40|$|Hereditary porphyrias are a {{group of}} eight {{metabolic}} disorders of the haem biosynthesis pathway that are characterised by acute neurovisceral symptoms, skin lesions, or both. Every porphyria is caused by abnormal function of a separate enzymatic step, resulting in a specific accumulation of haem precursors.

Acute porphyrias present with acute attacks, typically consisting of severe abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, confusion, and seizure, and can be life-threatening. <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>porphyrias</b> present with either acute painful photosensitivity or skin fragility and blisters. Rare recessive porphyrias usually manifest in early childhood with either severe cutaneous photosensitivity and chronic haemolysis or chronic neurological symptoms with or without photosensitivity. Porphyrias are still underdiagnosed, but when they are suspected, and dependent on clinical presentation, simple first-line tests can be used to establish the diagnosis in all symptomatic patients.

40|$|The porphyrias {{comprise}} {{a set of}} diseases, each representing an individual defect {{in one of the}} eight enzymes mediating the pathway of heme synthesis. The diseases are genetically distinct but have in common the overproduction of heme precursors. In the case of the acute (neurologic) porphyrias, the cause of symptoms appears to be overproduction of a neurotoxic precursor. For the <b>cutaneous</b> <b>porphyrias,</b> it is photosensitizing porphyrins. Some types have both acute and cutaneous manifestations. The clinical presentation of acute porphyria consists of abdominal pain, nausea, and occasionally seizures. Only a small minority of those who carry a mutation for acute porphyria have pain attacks. The triggers for an acute attack encompass certain medications and severely decreased caloric intake. The propensity of females to acute attacks has been linked to internal changes in ovarian physiology. Symptoms are accompanied by large increases in delta-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in plasma and urine. Treatment of an acute attack centers initially on pain relief and elimination of inducing factors such as medications; glucose is administered to reverse the fasting state. The only specific treatment is administration of intravenous hemin. An important goal of treatment is preventing progression of the symptoms to a neurological crisis. Patients who progress despite hemin administration have undergone liver transplantation with complete resolution of symptoms. A current issue is the unavailability of a rapid test for urine porphobilinogen in the urgent-care setting...|$|R

40|$|Background: Congenital erythropoietic {{porphyria}} (CEP) is an autosomal recessive <b>cutaneous</b> <b>porphyria</b> caused by decreased activity of uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS). Its predominant characteristics include bullous cutaneous photosensitivity to visible light from early infancy, progressive photomutilation and chronic haemolytic anaemia. Due to its rarity and genetic heterogeneity, clinical phenotypes are unclear {{and its impact}} on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has not been previously assessed. Objectives To define comprehensively CEP phenotypes and assess their impact on HRQoL, and to correlate these factors with laboratory parameters. Methods: A single observer assessed patients with CEP from four European countries. Results: Twenty-seven unrelated patients with CEP, aged between 7 Æ 6 and 65 years, participated in the study. The patients came from the U. K. (17), France (4), Switzerland (4) and Germany (2). Additional data were obtained for two deceased patients. Newly characterized features of CEP include acute-onset cutaneous and noncutaneous symptoms immediately following sunlight exposure, and pink erythematous facial papules. There was a lack of consistent genotype– phenotype correlation in CEP. The main poor prognostic factors in CEP are the early age of disease onset and haematological complications. Conclusions CEP is a multisystem disease; cutaneous, ocular, oral and skeletal manifestations also contribute to disease severity and impact on HRQoL, in addition to the haematological complications. The rarity of the disease can lead to delayed diagnosis. The lack of consistent genotype–phenotype correlation in CEP suggests a contribution to phenotype from other factors, such as environment, patients’ photoprotective behaviour and genes other than UROS. There is currently an unmet need for multidisciplinary management of patients with CEP...|$|E
40|$|Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is an {{inherited}} <b>cutaneous</b> <b>porphyria</b> characterized by partial deficiency of ferrochelatase (FECH), accumulation of protoporphyrin IX in erythrocytes, skin, and liver, and acute photosensitivity. Genetic counseling in EPP requires identification of FECH mutations, but current sequencing-based procedures fail to detect mutations in {{about one in}} six families. We have used gene dosage analysis by quantitative PCR to identify large deletions of the FECH gene in 19 (58 %) of 33 unrelated UK patients with EPP in whom mutations could not be detected by sequencing. Seven deletions were identified, six of which were previously unreported. Breakpoints were identified for six deletions (c. 1 – 7887 –IVS 1 + 2425 insTTCA; c. 1 – 9629 –IVS 1 + 2437; IVS 2 - 1987 –IVS 4 + 352 del; c. 768 –IVS 7 + 244 del; IVS 7 + 2784 –IVS 9 + 108 del; IVS 6 + 2350 –TGA+ 95 del). Five breakpoints were in intronic repeat sequences (AluSc, AluSq, AluSx, L 1 MC 4). The remaining deletion (Del Ex 3 – 4) {{is likely to be}} a large insertion–deletion.

A population-based cohort study was designed by record linkage between the Norwegian Porphyria Register, covering 70 % of all known porphyria patients in Norway, and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, based on all births in Norway during 1967 – 2006. The risks of the adverse pregnancy outcomes preeclampsia, delivery by caesarean section, low birth weight, premature delivery, small for gestational age (SGA), perinatal death, and congenital malformations were compared between porphyric mothers {{and the rest of the}} population. The 200 mothers with porphyria had 398 singletons during the study period, whereas the 1, 100, 391 mothers without porphyria had 2, 275, 317 singletons.

40|$|Ashley M Lane, 1 Jerome T McKay, 2  Herbert L Bonkovsky 1 1 Department of Internal Medicine, Section on Gastroenterology; 2 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USAAbstract: Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and the phenotypically similar disease X-linked protoporphyria (XLPP) are {{inherited}} <b>cutaneous</b> <b>porphyrias</b> characterized clinically by acute non-blistering photosensitivity, intolerance to sunlight, {{and significantly}} reduced quality of life. They {{are due to}} marked overproduction of protoporphyrin (PP) chiefly by erythroblasts and reticulocytes. In EPP, the underlying genetic defect is in the ferrochelatase gene, which encodes the final enzyme in the heme synthetic pathway. In XLPP, the genetic defect is a gain-of-function mutation, usually a four-base deletion, in the gene that encodes the enzyme 5 -aminolevulinic acid synthase- 2, the first and rate-controlling enzyme of heme synthesis in developing red blood cells. The excess PP causes acute and painful photosensitivity, being activated by light in the long ultraviolet to blue spectrum (380 – 420 nm, the Soret band). Although several treatments have been proposed, presently no very effective treatment exists for EPP or XLPP. Afamelanotide (Scenesse®) is a first-in-class synthetic analog of α-melanocyte stimulating hormone. Afamelanotide mimics the naturally occurring hormone to increase skin pigmentation by increasing melanin production in melanocytes, resulting in increased sunlight tolerance in those with EPP/XLPP. Afamelanotide is currently approved {{for use in the}} European Union and Switzerland, and it is under review in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with EPP/XLPP. This paper provides a review of the clinical characteristics and current therapies for EPP/XLPP.

40|$|A {{deficiency}} in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) enzyme activity, the fifth enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, {{is found in}} patients with {{sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda}} (s-PCT), familial porphyria cutanea tarda (f-PCT), and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP). Subnormal UROD activity is due to mutations of the UROD gene in both f-PCT and HEP, but no mutations have been found in s-PCT. Genetic analysis has determined that f-PCT is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In contrast, HEP, a severe form of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>porphyria,</b> is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. HEP is characterized by a profound deficiency of UROD activity, and the disease is usually manifest in childhood. In this study, a strategy was designed to identify alleles responsible for the HEP phenotype in three unrelated families. Mutations of UROD were identified by direct sequencing of four amplified fragments that contained the entire coding sequence of the UROD gene. Two new missense mutations were observed at the homoallelic state: P 62 L (proline-to-leucine substitution at codon 62) in a Portuguese family and Y 311 C (tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 311) in an Italian family. A third mutation, G 281 E, was observed in a Spanish family. This mutation has been previously described in three families from Spain and one from Tunisia. In the Spanish family described in this report, a paternal uncle of the proband developed clinically overt PCT as an adult and proved to be heterozygous for the G 281 E mutation.
