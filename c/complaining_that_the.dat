5|$|The press {{themselves}} came in {{for some}} criticism in this respect, with the group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Times and other media outlets focused {{on the effect of}} Nannygate on white, upper-middle-class women, and excluded the perspective of the actual immigrant childcare workers.|$|E
5|$|Lucas voiced displeasure in the puppet's {{appearance}} and immobility, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> puppet {{had to be}} moved around the set to film different scenes.

5|$|The West Pier was {{constructed}} during {{a boom in}} pleasure pier building in the 1860s, during which 22 new piers were erected across Britain. It was designed by architect Eugenius Birch as a place for seaside visitors to enjoy fresh sea air. Some wealthy residents in the nearby Regency Square objected to construction, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> planned toll houses at the entrance would spoil {{the view of the}} sea from their homes. It was felt that the pier would {{have a positive effect on}} property values in the town, so the pier was approved. Construction began in 1863 and the pier opened to the public on 6 October 1866.|$|E

5|$|Under the 2008 Charging Order {{introduced}} on 15 November 2008, charges between 10pm and 6am were discontinued, but standard daytime rates increased, {{starting at}} £1.50 for cars. On 7 October 2012 the charges increased to £2 for cars, £2.50 for 2 axle goods vehicles and £5 for multi-axle goods vehicles. By 2012, local businesses were <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crossing's charge booths were impeding local growth. The government {{announced that a}} new electronic charging system would be introduced in 2014. Drivers {{would be able to}} pay by phone, text, online or in shops. The charge was proposed to increase to £2.50 for cars, £3 for two-axle goods vehicles and £6 for multi-axle vehicles. A later report stated that drivers evading the charge could be fined as much as £105.|$|E
5|$|An Act of Parliament {{was passed}} {{to allow a}} wrought iron {{suspension}} bridge to be built instead of stone, and tolls levied to recoup the cost. A company was formed and funds raised {{during the first few}} months of 1830, but the money raised was not sufficient for the construction. Despite this, the act received Royal Assent in May 1830. Brunel produced a new proposal costing £10,000 less than Telford's design and gained support for it in the local press. James Meadows Rendel, William Armstrong and William Hill also submitted new, cheaper proposals, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> committee had not set a budget. In 1831 a second competition was held, with new judges including Davies Gilbert and John Seaward examining the engineering qualities of the proposals. Thirteen designs were submitted; Telford's was the only one in which the chains achieved the weight per square inch required by the judges but it was rejected as being too expensive. The winner was declared to be a design by Smith and Hawkes of the Eagle Foundry in Birmingham. Brunel had a personal meeting with Gilbert and persuaded him to change the decision. The committee then declared Brunel the winner and he was awarded a contract as project engineer. The winning design was for a suspension bridge with fashionably Egyptian-influenced towers. In 2010, newly discovered letters and documents revealed that, in producing his design, Brunel had taken advice from his father, Sir Marc Isambard Brunel. The elder Brunel had recommended including a central support for the bridge, as he did not believe a single-span bridge of such length could be constructed. His son chose to ignore his advice.|$|E
5|$|Development of the {{sandwich}} began in 2001 {{in response to}} several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King {{held a series of}} consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales. By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of {{the sandwich}}es, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling product introduction. The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper {{was one of the few}} noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. president Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he said it's too early to tell whether the changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the Chicken Whopper's introduction enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name. As of November 2013, the Chicken Whopper is the current grilled chicken sandwich sold by Burger King in the Middle East.|$|E

25|$|On 23 February 1883, Sir Henry Trueman Wood, Secretary of the Royal Society of Arts, sent {{a letter}} to The Times, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> SSLA was using a title too much like its own, and that it had been asking the RSA's members to sign up to the Society of Science, Letters and Art while giving the {{impression}} that the RSA had commissioned this request.

25|$|To {{the back}} of the church stood the Oldham Corporation Tram Depot.

In 1910 the congregation considered whether it might buy the Depot as well but nothing came of this. In 1912 the church committee wrote to the Tramways Manager <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> grinding of trams often disturbed worship.

25|$|Most Koreans are {{business}} owners with establishments such as restaurants, video rental places, bars and saunas, {{many of which}} cater exclusively to the Korean population, with signs and menus in Korean.

Another issue has been legal problems, both with the status of merchandise and the status of employees. A store owned by Koreans was shut down by police for selling imported merchandise of questionable origin in 2002, with 33 workers detained.|$|E
25|$|Ryan soon {{showed signs}} of discontent with his {{situation}} there. In January 1859 he wrote his Provincial Superior, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> expected instruction in theology was not being done and about {{the weight of his}} workload with the boys, being alone in this task. A reply counseling patience brought another request for a change of the situation which included a veiled hint at the possibility of his leaving the Congregation.

25|$|The advertised {{battery life}} on most models is {{different}} from the real-world achievable life. For example, the fifth generation 30GB iPod is advertised as having up to 14 hours of music playback. An MP3.com report stated that this was virtually unachievable under real-life usage conditions, with a writer for MP3.com getting on average less than 8 hours from an iPod. In 2003, class action lawsuits were brought against Apple <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> battery charges lasted for shorter lengths of time than stated and that the battery degraded over time. The lawsuits were settled by offering individuals either US$50 store credit or a free battery replacement.|$|E
