C100 was designed for On-Air applications and based around an assignable 'channel tile' control surface.

25|$|At the 87th AES Convention in 1989, Dugan {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} using an automixer inserted within target channels on a professional audio mixer. Each microphone's signal would be interrupted inside its <b>channel</b> <b>strip</b> and sent to a variable gain circuit contained within the automixer. The signal would then be returned to the mixer at a level consistent with the Dugan algorithm. This became the Dugan Model D automixer.|$|E

25|$|Mixing {{consoles}} {{often include}} high-pass filtering at each <b>channel</b> <b>strip.</b> Some models have fixed-slope, fixed-frequency high-pass filters at 80 or 100Hz {{that can be}} engaged; other models have sweepable high-pass filters, filters of fixed slope that can be set within a specified frequency range, such as from 20 to 400Hz on the Midas Heritage 3000, or 20 to 20,000Hz on the Yamaha M7CL digital mixing console. Veteran systems engineer and live sound mixer Bruce Main recommends that high-pass filters be engaged for most mixer input sources, except for those such as kick drum, bass guitar and piano, sources which will have useful low frequency sounds. Main writes that DI unit inputs (as opposed to microphone inputs) do not need high-pass filtering as they {{are not subject to}} modulation by low-frequency stage wash—low frequency sounds coming from the subwoofers or the public address system and wrapping around to the stage. Main indicates that high-pass filters are commonly used for directional microphones which have a proximity effect—a low-frequency boost for very close sources. This low frequency boost commonly causes problems up to 200 or 300Hz, but Main notes that he has seen microphones that benefit from a 500Hz high-pass filter setting on the console.|$|E

500|$|... "I Care" [...] {{comprised}} 75 {{tracks in}} total: 35 {{for the music}} and 40 for the vocals. According to Swivel, the main challenge in mixing [...] "I Care" [...] was hand‑aligning every single drum shot as it was time-consuming. He said, [...] "It's super‑monotonous, but it's the best way I can do it. If you Beat Detective the drums to the grid, it's never perfect." [...] As the layering of the drums had to be right on the millisecond, Swivel did one kick and snare at a time. This helped him ensure that the kicks line up with the programmed drums, hence preventing any phase inversion. Accordingly, each drum punched through as strongly as the last. The inspiration for the main drum sound on [...] "I Care" [...] came to Swivel at around four {{o'clock in the morning}} during a mixing session. He took a large plate sound from Avid’s D‑Verb plug‑in, rolled the high frequencies off at 8.6kHz, and sent it through an SSL <b>channel</b> <b>strip</b> with a gate on it, setting the release time to 0.6 seconds. He said, [...] "It's a really basic plug‑in, and I used a very 80s‑sounding gated reverb." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 23, 2009, Logic Pro 9 was announced. A {{major new}} feature {{included}} [...] "Flex Time", Apple's take on [...] "elastic" [...] audio, which allows audio to be quantized. A {{version of the}} pedalboard from GarageBand was included, together with a new virtual guitar amplifier where the modeled components could be combined in different ways. There were also a number of improvements to audio editing, fulfilled user requests such as [...] "bounce in place" [...] and selective track and <b>channel</b> <b>strip</b> import, {{as well as an}} expanded content library including one more Jam Pack. Some of the bundled software, including MainStage 2 and Soundtrack Pro 3, was also improved. Logic Pro 9 is Universal Binary, although not officially supported for use on PowerPC computers. SoundDiver, which had been quietly bundled with previous versions, was dropped, eliminating support for arguably the world's most popular synthesizer editor/librarian. As Apple has bundled so many software instruments with Logic, it is not likely that we'll see the return of integration with external synthesizer hardware to the Logic platform.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new multiaccess coding strategy called stripping CDMA for a LOOK AWGN <b>channel.</b> <b>Stripping</b> CDMA {{can be viewed as}} a generalization of the regular CDMA scheme to one that can achieve arbitrarily high bandwidth efficiency. It can also be viewed as a modification of the pure stripping scheme to one that is suited for multiaccess channel with bursty users. In this scheme, each user is split into M subusers and the decoder consist of M stripping stages using only single-user decoders. All transmitters of all users are identical, making it suitable for bursty user environment where the set of active users is not known in advanced. No synchronization between users at the phase, symbol, or frame level is needed. Although the scheme is only optimal asymptotically in M, it is close to optimal for small M, depending on the bandwidth efficiency. Performance of this scheme using existing non-optimal convolutional code is also investigated. I. Introduction One of the main objectives [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{compartmentalisation}} {{of the mix}} {{into separate}} <b>channel</b> <b>strips,</b> Digital Audio Workstation displays often result in global attributes and relationships between channels becoming hard to discern. This is {{despite the fact that}} overviews of mix information may help support direct visual comparison and make the visual data more coherent, thereby reducing the cognitive load involved in navigation and freeing up resources for critical listening (the focused listening to details of an audio mix, including dynamics, tone, blend and stereo placement). In this study participants were asked to locate visual information from a 24 -channel mixer using interface designs with and without overviews. At the same time as locating the visual information, participants were required to identify changes in the panning (stereo positioning) of specified tracks in an audio mix. Results suggest that overviews not only allow more efficient search for visual mix information, but also significantly improve concurrent critical listening tasks...|$|R
