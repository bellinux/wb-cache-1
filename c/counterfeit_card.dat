40|$|LL. M. Despite {{payment cards}} being of a fairly recent origin, 1 these {{instruments}} of payment play an increasingly {{significant role in}} commerce. With reference to credit cards, Cornelius already in 2003 stated: “They fulfil various functions that are increasingly important {{at a time that}} ecommerce is taking off at a tremendous pace. ” 2 Similarly criminals continuously use more inventive and technologically advanced methods to commit fraud, including <b>counterfeit</b> <b>card</b> fraud. Is the South African criminal law, however, keeping up? The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether the various activities which form part of the criminal business value chain relating to <b>counterfeit</b> <b>card</b> fraud, with specific reference to bank payment cards, are sufficiently criminalised in South Africa or whether the inability of our criminal law to address the challenges posed by this crime type necessitates the introduction of further legislation. In the first part of the dissertation the South African common and statutory criminal law is investigated in some depth to establish the applicability thereof on the activities forming part of the criminal business value chain relevant to <b>counterfeit</b> <b>card</b> fraud. The appropriateness of certain statutory provisions is questioned and recommendations are made to amend current legislation. An argument is also advanced for further development of the common-law offence of theft to include identity theft and the unlawful copying and subsequent use of data. Brief reference is made to the international situation. Chapter 2 is an introduction to bank payment card fraud in South Africa focusing on the most prevalent forms thereof being card-not-present fraud and <b>counterfeit</b> <b>card</b> fraud. Reference is made to the manner in which offences related to <b>counterfeit</b> <b>card</b> fraud are currently approached in our criminal courts and the limited impact prosecutions has on the prevalence of this fraud type...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{the use of}} one's {{bank card}} to pay or {{withdraw}} money is common. Modern technology provides us with the convenience of instant transactions at the automated teller machine or point of sale but unfortunately, it has also brought the reality and risk of card skimming and <b>counterfeit</b> <b>card</b> fraud. Criminals have become very efficient and technologically advanced in skimming and counterfeiting cards, {{to such an extent}} that <b>counterfeit</b> <b>card</b> fraud has become a significant threat to the public, banking, retail and business in South Africa. <b>Counterfeit</b> <b>card</b> fraud is a complex, multi-faceted crime, requiring specific skills and knowledge of card counterfeiting methods from police and bank investigators. The scope of its investigation is wide. It includes different crime scenes and offenders, sophisticated equipment and various aspects that need to be identified positively. Investigators find it difficult to identify perpetrators and certain aspects unique to this crime and, as a result, many investigations are unsuccessful. This research endeavours to establish what identification methods are available to investigators and which are effective. Police PracticeM. Tech. (Forensic Investigation...|$|E

40|$|In e-commerce, {{credit card}} fraud is an {{evolving}} problem. The {{growing number of}} credit card transactions provides more opportunity for thieves to steal credit card numbers and subsequently commit fraud. Credit card fraud can be perpetrated through stolen cards, <b>counterfeit</b> <b>card</b> and stolen card details. The defensive measure issuing bank can take to overcome this liability is by introducing fraud detection systems (FDSs) in their database. Although different methods have been implemented to detect fraud but application of probability and selection of threshold value add an extra advantage for FDS to detect anomalies in on-line transactions. Therefore this paper implements another method of selecting threshold values (dynamic/adaptive) based on individual cardholder spending profile. In order to increase {{the confidence of the}} threshold values the results are verified using performance metrics. The two methods were compared and the results showed that adaptive method is suitable for detecting fraud in credit card transactions...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of credit}} cards has {{become a way of}} life in many parts of the world. Credit cards have also created many new {{opportunities}} for criminal activity. It is in this light that organizations such as VISA International have explored a variety of security alternatives by constantly reviewing security measures that may be applied to cards and devote considerable resources to the maintenance of security systems and programmes. These programmes mandated by the association, include uniform card standards, security standards for manufactures, embossing and encoding of cards, standards for mailing the cards and credit background investigations of applicants. These standards assist investigators in examining counterfeit cards and distinguish a <b>counterfeit</b> <b>card</b> from a genuine card. The constant reviewing of security features and methods by the association is to create a card that is technically difficult to alter or counterfeit. Criminology and Security ScienceM. Tech.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of electronic commerce {{has brought in}} its wake some major security concerns. Electronic Payment has dominated and attracted much attention in recent times as all major stakeholders, thus payment operators, electronic card manufacturers as well as and cardholders continue to seek for effective means of combating the threats of internet frauds and more especially credit card frauds. Of the security issues facing banks everywhere, prevention of credit cards frauds {{has always been a}} high priority Credit card frauds come in several ways. The most prevalent and commonly known type is <b>counterfeit</b> <b>card</b> fraud. Counterfeit fraud has now been overtaken as the most costly type of card fraud by a newer method, that of Cardholder-Not-Present (CNP) fraud which accounts for higher percentage of frauds in electronic payment in most developed countries. However, as new banking channels have opened up, for example internet, phone banking and e- commerce, and the boom in credit card use, crime has migrated to seek any opportunity to attack these new and immature transaction methods. Our study is an attempt to delve a little further into the issue of credit card frauds by exploring the processes involved and pursued by two financial institutions in Sweden and India, focusing on the four key processes identified by Buttfago and Dyxler.

Some companies that are notable for making these cards include Topps, Upper Deck Company, and Panini Group. Previous manufacturers include Fleer (now a brand name owned by Upper Deck), Bowman (now a brand name owned by Topps), and Donruss (now a brand name owned by Panini).

This time the Murdoch pay TV businesses are under scrutiny. Allegations aired {{last week on the}} BBC and published in the Australian Financial Review suggest that News Corp’s former subsidiary NDS, which is now being sold to Cisco for $ 5 billion, ran an extraordinarily dirty campaign to undermine its rivals. News denies any suggestion of wrongdoing. NDS is not a broadcaster, but it occupies a critical, and very lucrative, place in News’s global pay TV business. In competition with a small number of other providers, NDS sells the conditional access systems used to ensure that only subscribers can view pay TV channels. In this game, the integrity of the system is everything: the pay TV business model depends completely on restricting access to the signal to paying customers. If a conditional access system is hacked, unlocking keys can be posted online, and <b>counterfeit</b> <b>cards</b> can easily be manufactured and sold, with potentially drastic losses to the broadcasters involved… Read the full article Photo: World Economic Foru...|$|R
