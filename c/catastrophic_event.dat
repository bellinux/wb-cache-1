5|$|The {{first known}} fossils of the closely related Mapusaurus {{were found in}} a bonebed {{consisting}} of several individuals at different growth stages. In their 2006 description of the genus, Coria and Currie suggested that though this {{could be due to}} a long term or coincidental accumulation of carcasses, the presence of different growth stages of the same taxon indicated the aggregation was not coincidental. In a 2006 National Geographic article, Coria stated that the bonebed was probably the result of a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>event,</b> and that the presence of mainly medium-sized individuals, with very few young or old, is normal for animals that form packs. Therefore, Coria said, large theropods may have hunted in groups, which would be advantageous when hunting gigantic sauropods.|$|E
5|$|Triton {{is unique}} among moons of {{planetary}} mass in that its orbit is retrograde to Neptune's rotation and inclined relative to Neptune's equator, {{which suggests that}} it did not form in orbit around Neptune but was instead gravitationally captured by it. The next-largest irregular satellite in the Solar System, Saturn's moon Phoebe, has only 0.03% of Triton's mass. The capture of Triton, probably occurring some time after Neptune formed a satellite system, was a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>event</b> for Neptune's original satellites, disrupting their orbits so that they collided to form a rubble disc. Triton is massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and to retain a thin atmosphere capable of forming clouds and hazes.|$|E

If we can present an argument that all hazards leading to <b>catastrophic</b> <b>events</b> have been handled, we defacto establish a baseline for a "safe" system.

For decades, most regions worldwide have experienced such events with high frequency and severity (Wisner et al. 2004).

5|$|The {{model for}} the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a closed binary star system. The larger of the two stars is the first to evolve off the main sequence, and it expands to form a red giant. The two stars now share a common envelope, causing their mutual orbit to shrink. The giant star then sheds most of its envelope, losing mass until it can no longer continue nuclear fusion. At this point it becomes a white dwarf star, composed primarily of carbon and oxygen. Eventually the secondary star also evolves off the main sequence to form a red giant. Matter from the giant is accreted by the white dwarf, causing the latter to increase in mass. Despite widespread acceptance of the basic model, the exact details of initiation and of the heavy elements produced in the <b>catastrophic</b> <b>event</b> are still unclear.|$|E

25|$|The {{experiments}} that underpin the single-event nature of chromothripsis, which {{is central to}} the theory, do not necessarily prove the existence of a single event. A single <b>catastrophic</b> <b>event</b> has not been observed experimentally. The hypothesis of chromothripsis is based on compound statistics. Known models of progressive cancer development do not contradict the occurrence of complex rearrangement and {{there is no evidence that}} shows these arrangements would happen within a single cell cycle catastrophe. It has been suggested that there is no single traumatic event, but that repeated breakage-fusion-bridge cycles cause the complex genetic patterns.|$|E

25|$|In chromothriptic areas you get {{alternation}} of regions which retain heterozygosity-two copy (no loss or gain), with {{regions that}} have loss of heterozygosity- one copy (heterozygous deletion). This {{suggest that the}} rearrangements took place {{at a time that}} both parental copies of the chromosome were present and hence early {{on the development of the}} cancer cell. This also supports the fact that chromothripsis occurs as one <b>catastrophic</b> <b>event</b> in the cells history as once heterozygosity is lost it generally can't be regained and hence the 2 copy heterozygous state occurring in patches throughout the chromothriptic region is hard to explain.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{overview}} of existing concepts of robustness and to identify promising directions for coping with uncertainty and risks of global changes. Unlike statistical robustness, general decision problems may have rather different facets of robustness. In particular, a key issue is the sensitivity with respect to low-probability <b>catastrophic</b> <b>events.</b> That is, robust decisions in the presence of <b>catastrophic</b> <b>events</b> are fundamentally different from decisions ignoring them. Specifically, proper treatment of extreme <b>catastrophic</b> <b>events</b> requires new sets of feasible decisions, adjusted to risk performance indicators, and new spatial, social and temporal dimensions. The discussion is deliberately kept at a level comprehensible to a broad audience through the use of simple examples that can be extended to rather general models. In fact, these examples often illustrate fragments of models that are being developed at IIASA...|$|R
25|$|Chromothripsis is the {{phenomenon}} by which up {{to thousands of}} clustered chromosomal rearrangements occur in a single event in localised and confined genomic regions in {{one or a few}} chromosomes, and is known to be involved in both cancer and congenital diseases. It occurs through one massive genomic rearrangement during a single <b>catastrophic</b> <b>event</b> in the cell's history. It is believed that for the cell to be able to withstand such a destructive event, the occurrence of such an event must be the upper limit of what a cell can tolerate and survive. The chromothripsis phenomenon opposes the conventional theory that cancer is the gradual acquisition of genomic rearrangements and somatic mutations over time.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{was legally}} {{accepted}} as a legitimate child, his parents did not accept him. The Truffauts had another child who died shortly after birth. This experience saddened them greatly {{and as a result}} they despised François because of the memory of regret that he represented (Knopf 4). He was an outcast from his earliest years, dismissed as an unwanted child. François was sent to live with his grandparents. It wasn't until François's grandmother's death before his parents took him in, much to the dismay of his own mother. The experiences with his mother were harsh. He recalled being treated badly by her but he found comfort in his father's laughter and overall spirit. The relationship with Roland was more comforting than the one with his own mother. François had a very depressing childhood after moving in with his parents. They would leave him alone whenever they would go on vacations. He even recalled memories of being alone during Christmas. Being left alone forced François into a sense of independence, he would often do various tasks around the house in order to improve it such as painting or changing the electric outlets. Sadly, these kind gestures often resulted in a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>event</b> causing him to get scolded by his mother. His father would mostly laugh them off.|$|E
25|$|With {{a better}} {{knowledge}} of the beetles distribution and habitat a recovery plan was formed. The first plan of action was to identify the areas targeted for recovery. It was decided that if four of the karst invertebrates (Neoleptoneta myopica, Tartarocreagris texana, Tevamaurops reddelli, and Batrisodes texanus) inhabited a cave {{it needed to be}} deemed a long term protection plan. If a habitat is to be recovered areas that contain high diversity and contain other rare fauna should be chosen. The additional listing of species should be taken into thought when choosing recovery areas. Areas of land selected for recovery should be spread out as far as possible to protect from a major <b>catastrophic</b> <b>event</b> does not take out the entire population. Other factors to consider when selecting recovery sites include areas that ensure long term protection, stable environment, and past and present land use. The second part of the recovery plan was to decide the size of area needed to save them. Areas of large continuous karst landscape must be implicated to ensure the survival of the invertebrates. Groundwater movements, topography, and drainage pattern were taken into place when selecting areas for recovery. All of these things must be perfect for a successful recovery. Also the type of use for surrounding land must be considered. If the area is to close to development, many factors can threaten its recovery including the threats listed above. The final step of the plan included land acquisition, conservation easements, and cooperative agreements with landowners. This final is very important. Without the land needed to save the invertebrates the recovery can not take place and the endangered species will become extinct.|$|E
