Without the pressure reaching supercritical levels for the working fluid, the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small; in steam turbines, turbine entry temperatures are typically 565 °C (the <b>creep</b> <b>limit</b> of stainless steel) and condenser temperatures are around 30 °C.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{assessment of}} <b>creep</b> rupture <b>limit</b> {{is an important}} issue for industrial components under combined action of cyclic thermal and mechanical loading. This paper proposes a new creep rupture assessment method under the Linear Matching Method framework, where the <b>creep</b> rupture <b>limit</b> is evaluated through an extended shakedown analysis using the revised yield stress, which is determined by the minimum of the yield stress of the material and the individual creep rupture stress at each integration point. Various numerical strategies have been investigated to calculate these creep rupture stresses associated with given temperatures and allowable creep rupture time. Three distinct methods: a) linear interpolation method, b) logarithm based polynomial relationship and c) the Larson–Miller parameter, are introduced to interpolate and extrapolate an accurate creep rupture stress, on the basis of discrete experimental creep rupture data. Comparisons between these methods are carried out to determine the most appropriate approach leading to the accurate solution to the creep rupture stresses for the creep rupture analysis. Two numerical examples including a classical holed plate problem and a two-pipe structure are provided to verify the applicability and efficiency of this new approach.

40|$|To avoid {{inclusion}} of the possible creep effects during normal service operation in future nuclear plants in the component design, {{it is important to}} define temperature, stress and time limits for negligible creep for P 91 steel. If these limits can be reliably defined, the component design {{in the vicinity of the}}se temperatures becomes clearer and the design below limits considerably easier. In the nuclear design rules there are generally accepted negligible creep limits for the austenitic steel 316 L(N) but not for P 91. The definitions for reference stress used in the codes for 316 L(N) steel cannot be applied for P 91 steel due to significantly different yield and tensile behaviour of this material. The definition on the negligible creep term itself is under debate. In this paper a series of low temperature creep tests and optimized creep strain models are presented for predicting very low strains at temperatures in the vicinity of the negligible <b>creep</b> <b>limit</b> temperatures (below 400 °C). It is shown that limiting the allowed creep strain below 0. 2 % is counterproductive if there is no clear reason for not allowing negligible deformation from primary creep.

40|$|Mill rolls {{are ones}} {{of the most}} {{expensive}} tools applied in plastic working processes and have to satisfy several criteria, which allow them to be used. Cast iron mill rolls, due to their fracture toughness and tribological properties, are the most often applied at hot-rolling in the last rolling stands. This results from the smallest dynamic loads of such rolling stands and the decisive influence of the surface quality of these tools on the surface quality of the rolled product. An improper microstructure of rolls can lead to their premature wearing, e. g. broken flanges, pivots twisting off etc. By means of the heat treatment the matrix microstructure and morphology of carbide precipitationscan be modified and this in-turn can influence cast iron properties. Determination of the influence of microstructure changes, caused by the heat treatment, on the properties of EN-GJN-HV 300 low-alloycast iron, after its modification and spheroidization – is the aim of the present paper. Those changes are based on the formation pearlitic or bainitic matrices at the similar morphology of graphite and ledeburitic cementite precipitations.

40|$|Since the first-published {{work in the}} 50 's {{the time}} {{dependent}} behaviour raised an increasing interest in wood material research. Creep research has a decisive influence in timber structures where prediction of total deflection is necessary for durable structural design. The nature of polymeric constituents induces viscoelastic behavior to wood. In constant environment the representation of creep against logarithm of time could be composed of two straight-line parts joined by a curved transition [1]. Such a linear description of kinetic suggests an infinite strain level in long-term prediction. However as a semi-crystalline polymer wood is expected to tend toward a limit of creep level. A simplified rheological approach using parabolic models has been proposed by Huet [2] to model timedependent behavior of wood in longitudinal direction. Sorption processes are suspected to accelerate time by increasing compliance [3]. This phenomenon called mechanosorptive effect interacts with ongoing time-dependent evolution and induces a slope decrease after a cycle in the logarithm description [4]. Matched spruce specimens (L= 100 x R= 10 x T= 2 mm) have been submitted to four-point bending creep test (inner span = 40 mm and outer span = 80 mm) in controlled climatic environment. The strain has been measured on lower and upper surface of each specimen using electric gages. Four specimens were loaded at high humidity level (w ! 27 %) below the limit of linearity of viscoelastic and mechanosorptive response [5].

40|$|Conducting {{polymers}} {{serve as}} electrically conductive actuators via ion diffusion {{in and out}} of the polymer when voltages are applied. Their actuation performance can be largely affected by deposition setup, post-deposition processing, type of electrolyte, applied voltage for actuation, and temperature. It was shown that increasing temperature caused higher active stress in polypyrrole, an attractive conducting polymer actuator material. However, detailed characterizations were lacking to determine whether the improved active stress was caused by structural change in the polymer and/or charging effect. A temperature-controlled solvent bath was integrated with a custom-built electrochemical dynamic mechanical analyzer to conduct isometric and isotonic tests on polypyrrole under elevated temperature. Experimental results showed that heating increased the charge transport through the polymer and thermal expansion in the polymer allowed more room for charge uptake. As a result, increase in ion movement largely contributed to improvements in actuation stress (rate) and strain (rate), while the decrease in stiffness due to heating had limited effect. Moreover, actuation performance was further improved by choosing large active ion type, BMIM. Although the active stress and strain increased via heating, <b>creep</b> <b>limits</b> the reversibility of conducting polymer actuators. To reduce creep rate, functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (fCNTs) were introduced to fabricate composites with polypyrrole and with PEDOT. Out of four attempted fabrication techniques, drop-casted multilayer structure demonstrated that increasing the amount of fCNTs reduced creep rate, but also decreased active strain, stiffness, and conductivity. Applying higher preload (up to 3 MPa) improved active strain in the composites by providing more space for charge uptake. The amount of sCNTs that provided optimal performance was approximately 20 - 30 % by weight. by Yenmei (Kerri) Keng. Thesis (S. M.)
