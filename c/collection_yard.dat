40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of health risks of chosen factors in the work environment and medical services in the recycling and secondary raw materials and waste processing field. The goal of the thesis is to chart companies which handle recycling and secondary raw materials and waste processing in the South Bohemian Region, {{to find out the}} risk factors that go in hand with this work and to determine in which work category these workers belong. I have determined three hypotheses within the research. Hypothesis 1 : The nature of the work activities does not correspond with suggested risks. Hypothesis 2 : The workers are not equipped with tools in accordance with detected risks. Hypothesis 3 : The workers of companies dealing with recycling and secondary raw materials and waste processing do not attend the necessary medical check-ups. The thesis consists of a theoretical and a practical part. In the theoretical part I have introduced the risk factors connected to recycling and secondary raw materials and waste processing. I have covered the problematics of medical services for the employees, occupational disease and the protection of health from unfavorable effects of the work environment. To reach my goal, I have utilized quantitative research methods. For data collecting I have used anonymous surveys {{in the area of the}} South Bohemian Region. In the survey, I have adressed scrapyards, composting plants, <b>collection</b> <b>yards</b> and waste dumps. The collected data were processed by the Microsoft Excel program.

40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) {{causes a}} highly {{contagious}} viral disease of even-toed ungulates {{and is one}} of the most important economic diseases of livestock. Most studies of FMDV are done in countries where control measures are being implemented. In contrast, in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, where FMDV is endemic and new strains are likely to emerge, there are only sporadic submissions to the World Reference Laboratory, Pirbright, United Kingdom. This paper describes the molecular epidemiology of FMDV in the Adamawa province of Cameroon based on a population sample of cattle herds. Serotypes SAT 2 and A were isolated in the cross-sectional study. SAT 2 isolates were all similar, with phylogenetic distances of < 6 %, and were most closely related to published sequences of isolates from Eritrea and Saudi Arabia. Serotype A isolates were more variable, with phylogenetic distances of 0 to 11 %, and were most closely related to historic isolates from Cameroon. Use of a population-based sample gives a representative sample of virus diversity and will improve our understanding of the evolution of FMDV and its epidemiology. A supplementary study of pigs passing through the railhead <b>collection</b> <b>yard</b> at Ngaoundere detected a serotype O virus. A third pilot longitudinal study monitored viral persistence in three cattle herds over 12 months, and serotype O and A viruses were recovered from a herd 12 months after it was first recorded as being infected with SAT 2 virus. The pig type O isolate was not closely related to that recovered from the cattle, suggesting that the pigs had not introduced the O virus into the cattle herds...|$|E

40|$|Each {{year over}} 300, 000 tons of yard {{materials}} no longer go to landfills or incinerators in Wisconsin.

Although many communities provide <b>collection</b> for <b>yard</b> materials; the most economical way to handle these materials is to compost them at home. Home composting saves money on soil amendments and improves your yard and gardens. Municipalities save too with reduced collection costs. (Note: stumps, roots or shrubs with intact root ball can still be landfilled or sent to incinerators which burn solid waste to recover energy.) A Burning Issue Burning leaves and brush is declining.

40|$|The various {{art works}} were {{assembled}} for exhibition with Sigmund Freud’s famous essay ‘Das Unheimliche’ (1919), in mind. Often {{referred to as}} ‘The Uncanny’, ‘Das Unheimliche’ actually translates into English as ‘The Unhomely’, and the essay identifies "the familiar, tame, intimate, friendly, etc. " that can somehow excite "fear in general". The exhibition was made {{in response to the}} permanent <b>collection</b> at Kettle’s <b>Yard,</b> the former home of collector Jim Ede and could in some ways be seen as a corrupted version of his home and collection, with works variously reflecting the forms and ideas of thing permanently on display in the house. Furnishings, fixtures and fittings are made to appear, in different ways, inexplicable, uncomfortable or supernatural. The three works included had been selected because they incorporated, or were crafted approximations of, familiar everyday objects which either {{as a result of the}} impoverished materials or the improvised nature of the making always seem to feel ‘wrong’. The work seems to be the result of some sort of inevitable logic with the outcome being a result of convenience rather than design. In the case of the ‘Stationary Mobile’ sellotape is a versatile and self sufficient material for modeling something transparent like a chandelier, especially when there is so much other ‘crystal’ stationary around, but the limitations of the material result in an abomination. There seems to be a something reassuringly familiar about using a bottle as the base for a lamp or candle, but in the case of ‘Black Towers’ the bottles are black and as result the lumpy hand made shades attached to the top are also, so denying it any conventional use. Because both materials and the minimal amount of construction involved in each work is so domestic and harmless it is through repetition or exaggeration that they begin to generate the unease or 'fear in general' described in the essay...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Romania is {{a former}} {{communist}} country in Eastern Europe. In 1990 the totalitarian regime was overthrown and restructuring of a free-market economy took place. This caused the rural economy to collapse, farmers are mostly self-dependent. In {{the same period a}} new environmental legislation was established, environmental protection became a national priority. Romania will probably join the European Union in 2007, therefore much European legislation has been and will be adopted. Garla Mare is a village in the rural south of Romania. The villagers are concerned that their waste management has a negative impact on their society. Other stakeholders in the local waste management are the local environmental Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) Eco-San, the German NGO Women of Europe for a Common Future and the local government. The stakeholders want to improve their waste management for different reasons, the villagers want to improve the surroundings to be able to develop ecotourism, the NGO’s are concerned for local health and the natural environment. The local government wants {{to live up to the}} newly developed legislation. They have in common that they all want to know how the present practise on waste management can be improved so that it will be according to the newly developed Romanian national legislation. The newly developed Romanian legislation had adopted many European waste management directives, but there is no strategic waste management hierarchy. In the future the separation of household waste, reuse and recycling and prevention of waste will get more attention. Changes in legislation in this direction can be expected in the future. At regional level plans are made for reuse of organic waste, at local level no policies or plans could be obtained. The existing legislation has not been implemented yet. The existing legislation is expected to be implemented in 2015 - 2020. Half of the Romanian citizens have no municipal waste collection, this practise is not illegal according to the present legislation. This will change however with the implementation the existing environmental legislation. There are hardly any facilities for sorting and reuse of waste, this must change around 2015 – 2020 when landfilling of organic waste must be prevented. In Garla Mare there is no central collection of waste or a governmental waste management strategy. The waste consists mostly of organic waste from fields, garden and animals and plastic waste. This waste is disposed of at the village border. Therefore the whole village is surrounded by landfills. It was not possible to obtain figures on the amounts of waste produced, but comparison with Bulgarian rural villages show that there is probably a production of 260 kilo organic waste and 8 kilo plastic per capita per year. The amount of plastic waste is too small for a local recycling programme. The options for waste management of organic waste are biogas production, composting and waste spreading. Since there is no money to invest in a biogas installation and waste spreading might become illegal with future legislation, composting is the best option for treating organic waste. This is also the outcome of regional plans for organic waste treatment in Romania and rural Bulgaria. The amounts of organic waste justify a small scale organic waste reuse programme. There is a choice to be made between central composting and small scale composting at household level in <b>yards.</b> <b>Collection</b> and transport can best be done with a tractor, but this costs money for a tractor and gas. Given the income situation in Garla Mare, there is not much money for central collection and a composting site. Composting at household level seems the most realistic option for treatment of organic waste. The Bulgarian government promotes composting at household level given the good results in regions where this practise is tradition, the success of these projects support the choice for composting at household level.
