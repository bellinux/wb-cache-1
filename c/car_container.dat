40|$|This paper {{considers}} the three-dimensional container packing problem (3 DCPP) under home delivery service, which predetermines an ordering of delivering ordered cargo boxes to customers, and aims to load {{a subset of}} those boxes according to the delivery ordering into a 3 D <b>car</b> <b>container</b> with maximal utilization ratio of the container space while prohibiting the process of delivering cargos to each customer from unloading and subsequent reloading of boxes. In practice, cargos can be taken out from not only the rear door of the delivery container but also the side door. Nonetheless, the previous research only considered the case with only a single door. Therefore, this paper establishes {{the model for the}} two-door 3 DCPP under home delivery service. Furthermore, the rule of invisible and untouchable items and the subvolume-based approach for the one-door problem are extended to resolve the two-door problem. Last, simulation analysis verifies performance of our approach...|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes, {{kitbashing}} {{has been}} used to create [...] "art" [...] per se. The Toronto sculptor Kim Adams has used HO gauge freight <b>cars,</b> <b>containers,</b> detail parts, figures and scenery to create artistic landscapes. American artist Kris Kuksi also uses kitbashing to detail his maximalist sculptures.|$|R
50|$|Baton Rouge is {{the furthest}} inland port on the Mississippi River that can {{accommodate}} ocean-going tankers and cargo carriers. The ships transfer their cargo (grain, crude, <b>cars,</b> <b>containers)</b> at Baton Rouge onto rails and pipelines (to travel east-west) or barges (to travel north). Deep-draft vessels cannot pass the Old Huey Long Bridge because the clearance is insufficient, {{and the river}} depth decreases significantly just to the north, near Port Hudson.|$|R
50|$|Bremerhaven {{has three}} active {{passenger}} rail stations, Bremerhaven Hauptbahnhof {{in the city}} centre, Bremerhaven-Lehe north of the centre and Bremerhaven-Wulsdorf {{in the southern part}} of the city. A fourth station, Bremerhaven-Speckenbüttel near the border to Langen has been out of service since 1988, though it might reopen when the Bremen S-Bahn scheme becomes operational. Bremerhaven's central station lost its last long-distance train in 2001. Now only regional connections to Bremen, Cuxhaven, Osnabrück and Hannover are available. The railways in Bremerhaven, however, still carry a heavy load of freight traffic, mostly new <b>cars,</b> <b>containers</b> and food.|$|R
5000|$|In 1952, the CPR {{became the}} first North American railway to {{introduce}} intermodal or [...] "piggyback" [...] freight service, where truck trailersare carried on flat <b>cars.</b> <b>Containers</b> later replaced most piggyback service. In 1996, the CPR introduced a scheduled reservation-only short-haul intermodal service between Montreal and West Toronto called the Iron Highway; it utilized unique equipment that was later replaced (1999) by conventional piggyback flatcars and renamed Expressway. This service was extended to Detroit with plans to reach Chicago however CP was unable to locate a suitable terminal.|$|R
25|$|The Bristol Port Company {{operates}} the surviving commercial docks of the Port of Bristol at Portbury and Avonmouth. Since privatisation in 1991 trade has increased to 12 million tonnes per annum, with a revenue exceeding £75 million, {{making it the}} fifteenth largest port in the UK, tenth largest in England. The main trades are forest products, <b>cars,</b> <b>containers,</b> bulk (coal, grain, animal feeds, aggregates), liquids (petroleum, aviation fuel, molasses, fruit juice), metals, and fresh produce. Plans are in place to massively increase capacity by building a new deepsea container terminal capable of handling ships up to 12,000 TEU.|$|R

40|$|Law {{enforcement}} agencies world-wide are keenly aware that chemical {{control is a}} crucial element to monitor the manufacture and distribution of illegal narcotics and synthetic substances. For this purpose components able to perform chemical identifications in contexts such as custom offices are needed, where inspection of trucks, <b>cars,</b> <b>containers,</b> {{as well as people}} and baggage, is required. Such components should be assembled as simple machines to be employed on-field by custom officers with no specific skill. In the following the last results of the research project CUSTOM will be presented.

25|$|When {{carried by}} rail, {{containers}} can be loaded on flatcars or in <b>container</b> well <b>cars.</b> In Europe, stricter railway height restrictions (smaller loading gauge and structure gauge) and overhead electrification prevent containers from being stacked two high, and containers are hauled one high either on standard flatcars or other railroad <b>cars.</b> Taller <b>containers</b> are often carried in well cars (not stacked) on older European railway routes where the loading gauge (especially with the reduced gauge for UK lines) is particularly small.|$|R
5000|$|The shipyards at Alang recycle {{approximately}} half of all ships salvaged around the world. It is considered the world's largest graveyard of ships. The yards are located on the Gulf of Khambat, 50 km southeast of Bhavnagar. Large supertankers, <b>car</b> ferries, <b>container</b> ships, and a dwindling number of ocean liners are beached during high tide, and as the tide recedes, hundreds of manual laborers move onto the beach to dismantle each ship, salvaging what they can and reducing the rest to scrap.|$|R
50|$|White Bay and {{adjacent}} Glebe Island {{have been working}} ports since the mid-1800s, handling just about everything from timber and paper, coal, sugar and cement to <b>cars</b> and <b>containers.</b> The NSW Government identified both as vital to the City's economy and in March 2013 announced its commitment to maintaining both as working ports as it frees up neighbouring bays for public access. Glebe Island is Sydney's last remaining deepwater port able to supply the City's ongoing demand for dry bulk goods such as sugar, gypsum and cement.|$|R

Its first trip carried 600 containers between North Vancouver, British Columbia, and Skagway, Alaska, on November 26, 1955; in Skagway, the containers were unloaded to purpose-built railroad cars for transport north to the Yukon, in the first intermodal service using trucks, ships, and railroad <b>cars.</b> Southbound <b>containers</b> were loaded by shippers in the Yukon and moved by rail, ship, and truck to their consignees without opening. This first intermodal system operated from November 1955 until 1982.|$|R
