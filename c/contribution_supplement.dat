40|$|Background: Euhelopus zdanskyi {{is one of}} {{relatively}} few sauropod taxa known from an almost complete skull and mandible. Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that Euhelopus is a somphospondylan titanosauriform, {{and that it is}} a member of the clade (Euhelopodidae) which is the sister taxon to the hugely successful, dominantly Cretaceous sauropod group Titanosauria. Methodology/Principal Findings: The skull elements of Euhelopus were CT scanned at Uppsala Akademiska Sjukhuset. Three-dimensional models of the elements were constructed from the DICOM data using Mimics 14. 0, InVesalius 3. 0, and GeoMagic Studio 2012, the skull was rearticulated in Rhinoceros 4. 0, and the final version was rendered in GeoMagic Studio 2012. Conclusions/Significance: The fact that relatively complete sauropod skulls are so rare in the fossil record, particularly among titanosauriforms, means that the skulls that are known should be as thoroughly described and well-illustrated as possible. This <b>contribution</b> <b>supplements</b> previous descriptions of the cranial elements of Euhelopus, one of the few euhelopodid taxa for which cranial material is known, by presenting a comprehensive photographic atlas of the skull elements to facilitate a better understanding of their morphology.

In particular, this work addresses large Reynolds number shape oscillations {{and focuses on}} the surface rheological effects that arise from the presence of insoluble surfactants at the interface. Parameters characterizing viscous effects from the bulk phases, surface viscous effects, Marangoni effects from the surface advection and diffusion of surfactants, and the Gibbs elasticity are all considered and analyzed to determine {{the relative importance of}} each <b>contribution.</b> <b>Supplementing</b> the analytical treatment for small-amplitude oscillations, a numerical boundary integral equation formulation is developed for the study of large-amplittide axisymmetric oscillations of a drop in vacuum. The boundary integral formulation is an extension of classical potential flow theory and approximately accounts for viscous effects in the bulk fluid as well as the surface viscous and Marangoni effects resulting from an insoluble surfactant contaminating the interface. Theoretical and numerical results are presented for four distinct cases. These, range from the case when the effects of the surfactants are 'negligible' to 'large' when compared to the viscous effects in the bulk phases.

40|$|Adult {{children}} are key supporters of elderly parents, providing both monetary and time resources. In the existing literature, {{the most commonly}} used approach to assess this intergenerational transfer process is the "need versus ability" model. It posits that parents with higher need are more likely to receive support, whereas adult children equipped with better support-giving ability are more likely to give transfers. In addition, adult children's transfer motivation, including altruism, reciprocity, and rational calculations, all provide theoretical insight into the question of transfer differentials. Using the 1992 and 1996 Health and Retirement Study (HRS 92 - 96), this dissertation goes beyond the need, ability, and motivation model to examine how adult children ages 51 to 61 satisfy their non-coresident parents' need. This project incorporates gender norms and adult children's labor force participation constraints to assess the gendered division of transfer practices. The effects of spouses' and siblings' roles, resource competition between grandchildren and their grandparents, resource competition between two living parents, and adult children's life course transition, are also considered. Statistical analysis shows that both gender norms and the gendered labor force structure affect adult children's transfer behaviors. Adult sons tend to use monetary transfers to substitute for time contributions because their opportunity costs in the wage market are high. Conversely, because the social norms construe women as primary caregivers, adult daughters' time contributions to parents do not decrease even when they are well-paid. Spouses of adult children may either be transfer supporters or resource competitors to their parents-in-law. While siblings are important in transfer practices, this study finds that sisters are more likely to substitute for adult children's caregiving roles, whereas brothers' <b>contributions</b> <b>supplement</b> adult children's transfer efforts. Finally, adult children's transfer practices are sensitive to their employment transitions. Adult children who stayed in the labor force from 1992 to 1996 are the most likely to increase their amount of monetary transfers. On the other hand, those who retired from their paid jobs in the studied time interval are more likely to increase their time contributions...|$|R
40|$|Enlargement {{is often}} {{regarded}} as an elite-driven process, which does not or not sufficiently include the views of ordinary citizens. At the same time, support for integration has been eroding over the last decade, contributing to a public-elite gap in preferences towards the process. This paper investigates the relationship between elite and citizens discourses by focusing on Serbia {{as one of the}} candidate countries. The case of a candidate country is interesting, as domestic elites need to obtain the support from citizens in making the EU-driven transformations, whereas citizens may be critical to some of the imposed reforms. This may push and pull both groups in the opposite directions, increasing the public-elite gap on European integration. This <b>contribution</b> <b>supplements</b> previous research, which identified discourses among citizens in Serbia, with an analysis of media content. Using vignettes for each discourse found among citizens, the contents of statements in two major Serbian newspapers have been coded. The analysis shows that all four citizen discourses are represented in media. The discourse favoring Serbia’s accession enjoys best representation in the media, reflecting views of Serbia’s political elite. In contrast, the narrative rejecting Serbia’s integration in the EU finds the least space in newspapers, while the remaining two discourses share almost an equal media representation. Most importantly, we find that approximately one fourth of media content does not fit any of the four citizen discourses. This demonstrates not only the size, but also the substance of the public-elite gap on European integration in Serbia. The public-elite gap illustrated here tilts the political debate in Serbia towards one with rather supportive expectations of enlargement and integration. At the same time, we noted that more critical views among citizens are not, or not yet, reflected in the media, while the media is reporting on issues that do not resonate with citizens’ views. A question is whether this is a sustainable route, and whether political ‘entrepreneurs’ will capitalize on these views in order to build alternative political platforms in Serbian politics or influence Serbia’s progress.

40|$|ABSTRACT: ‘Our {{students}} {{today are}} all ‘native speakers’ {{of the digital}} language of computers, video games and the Internet’ (Prensky, 2001). Despite its position as a dominant social networking platform globally, research reveals that faculty lag behind students in their inclination to engage Facebook for learning (Junco, 2012). A creative college {{should be at the}} forefront of pedagogy and practice and the millennial student cohorts who inhabit our classrooms live connected lives through social media with peer interaction a strong predictor of student persistence and completion (Junco, 2012). As industries are increasingly globalised, our students’ future workplaces require facility with cross-cultural collaboration, yet curricula often remain situated within the home culture. With creativity a key attribute for young professionals; learning how to learn and harnessing opportunities for independent, intrinsically motivated engagements are vital for students and teachers alike (Collins & Amabile, 1999; Csikszentmihalyi, 1999). This presentation focuses on exploring key themes raised by an exploratory collaborative project using Facebook as a platform to connect London College of Fashion Marketing & Design students with students at City University Hong Kong studying courses in Advertising and Popular Culture. The collaboration took the form of a shared private Facebook group - an International Fashion Panel - where staff and students shared learning resources and current critiques around brand identity, cross-cultural marketing and city branding. The Facebook platform was used both separately and collaboratively to support students’ co-creation of their educational experience e. g. carrying out primary research on the Hong Kong fashion industry. The digitally mediated collaboration allowed for flexibility in when and how education took place, providing a third space for co-creation of learning.

In this paper we perform the complete one-loop renormalization of the neutral scalar sector of the μνSSM with one generation of right-handed neutrinos in a mixed on-shell/DR scheme. The renormalization procedure is discussed in detail, emphasizing conceptual differences to the minimal (MSSM) and next-to-minimal (NMSSM) supersymmetric standard model regarding the field renormalization and the treatment of non-flavor-diagonal soft mass parameters, which {{have their origin in}} the breaking of R-parity in the μνSSM.

Sargent's influence may also be seen more directly in the horticultural interests of his kinsmen, Hunnewell and Charles Sprague Sargent.|$|R
