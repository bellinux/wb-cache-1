5|$|The glyphs are stylized human, animal, {{vegetable}} and geometric shapes, and often form compounds. Nearly all those with heads are oriented {{head up and}} are either seen face on or in profile to the right, {{in the direction of}} writing. It is not known what significance turning a glyph head-down or to the left may have had. Heads often have characteristic projections on the sides which may be eyes (as on the sea turtle glyph below, and more <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> sea-turtle petroglyphs) but which often resemble ears (as on the anthropomorphic petroglyph in the next section). Birds are common; many resemble the frigatebird (see image directly below) which was associated with the supreme god Makemake. Other glyphs look like fish or arthropods. A few are similar to petroglyphs found throughout the island.|$|E
5|$|It then {{occurred}} to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it {{occurred to}} me to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was <b>clearly,</b> <b>on</b> the whole the best fitted live... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.|$|E
25|$|The first brain {{image of}} an {{individual}} with psychosis was completed {{as far back as}} 1935 using a technique called pneumoencephalography (a painful and now obsolete procedure where cerebrospinal fluid is drained from around the brain and replaced with air to allow the structure of the brain to show up more <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> an X-ray picture).|$|E

25|$|Yeltsin, {{who began}} to lose his hold on power as his health deteriorated, wanted Chernomyrdin back, but the {{legislature}} refused to give its approval. After the Duma rejected Chernomyrdin's candidacy twice, Yeltsin, his power <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> the wane, backed down. Instead, he nominated Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who on 11 September 1998 {{was approved by the}} State Duma by an overwhelming majority.|$|E
25|$|In England {{there were}} 45 {{counties}} and 296 districts, in Wales there were 8 and 37. Six of the English counties were designated as metropolitan counties. The new English counties were based <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> the traditional ones, albeit with several substantial changes. The 13 historic counties of Wales, however, were abandoned entirely for administrative purposes, and 8 new ones instituted.|$|E
25|$|GAP is {{estimated}} to double Turkey's irrigable farmland. The increase of agricultural activity of GAP in its incomplete state is visible <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> the USDA graph above. Cotton production increased from 150,000 metric tons to 400,000 metric tons, making the region the top cotton producer. But {{at the same time}} other regions declined, which means that Turkey's overall output stayed relatively steady.|$|E

25|$|The {{conflict}} that arose {{at that point}} of the negotiations ended the possibility of further negotiation. During the reception of former British Prime Minister Edward Heath during his sixth visit to the PRC, Deng Xiaoping commented quite <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> the impossibility of exchanging sovereignty for administration, declaring an ultimatum: the British government must modify or give up its position or the PRC will announce its resolution {{of the issue of}} Hong Kong sovereignty unilaterally.|$|E
25|$|Holbein's {{portrait}} of Jane Meutas is a drawing {{in black and}} coloured chalks on pink prepared paper, 283 x 212 mm, and has the name 'The Lady Meutas' written <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> its face. To {{the right of the}} head, Holbein has added a schematic sketch of his sitter's hands. On one finger is a heart-shaped leaf which German painters of the time used as a symbol for the colour green, taken to represent an emerald ring. The same leaf symbol appears in Lady Meutas’s oval medallion.|$|E
25|$|Two bureaucrats, first Bertrand (A) {{and then}} Morvan (B) enter a sixth floor {{apartment}} where they find Croker (C) standing centre stage {{in front of}} an open window {{with his back to the}} audience, <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> the point of throwing himself out of it. A pair of identical tables, lamps and chairs are there waiting for them, stage left and stage right. The set is therefore symmetrical. The name Croker is an obvious pun on the euphemism, ‘to croak’ i.e. to die, and a name to which Beckett has shown some attachment.|$|E

25|$|A {{park was}} {{constructed}} on the site, {{in the middle}} of which a “cone” was built. The contaminated soil from the edges of the former dump was placed in this cone. The cone {{has been described as a}} “layered cake”, which has various layers insulating the “delicacies” of the core of the cone. The cone can be seen <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> maps as a circle between the Roihupelto metro depot and the Ring I highway. It is 20 metres high, but it appears even higher due to the natural slopes of the esker below.|$|E
25|$|A second {{distinguishing}} {{feature of this}} new era was that flat lead roofs now often replaced the former attics where the servants had slept. However, this lack of space was compensated in the new houses by the entire ground floor being given over to the servants. This floor, usually built of rusticated stone, was beneath the larger and grander piano nobile occupied by the employers. Ornate external staircases were built {{to the front door}} which was now <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> the first floor. The nobility now had very obvious minimal contact with those living downstairs.|$|E
25|$|Hug {{would then}} lose {{in his next}} two outings, firstly to Ernesto Hoost by {{majority}} decision at the K-3 Grand Prix '95 on July 16, 1995 and then Mike Bernardo by KO in a rematch at K-1 Revenge II on September 3, 1995. The fight was even going into the latter stages of round two when Bernardo landed a right hook which sent Hug to the canvas. He {{was able to make}} it back to his feet but was <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> wobbly legs and the referee in charge, Genshu Igari, stopped him from taking any more damage than was necessary.|$|E

25|$|Field-work {{is carried}} out using {{a small part of}} the base map fixed to a survey board, covered with a piece of {{draughting}} film, and drawn with pencils. The final map needs to be drawn with sufficient accuracy so that a feature shown on the map can be identified <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> the ground by the competitor, thus, field-workers need to locate features with a high level of accuracy, to ensure consistency between map and terrain. Where the map and terrain are inconsistent, the feature becomes unusable: no control point can be placed there. Periodic corrections to the map may be necessary, typically vegetation changes in forested areas.|$|E
25|$|With {{the team}} <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> {{the verge of}} missing {{the playoffs for the}} first time in 13 years, Paul Holmgren set his sights on {{rebuilding}} the team and preparing for the future. Forsberg, unwilling to commit to playing next season, was traded to Nashville for Scottie Upshall, Ryan Parent and 2007- first and third-round draft picks at the deadline. Veteran defenseman Alexei Zhitnik was traded to the Atlanta Thrashers for prospect defenseman Braydon Coburn, while disappointing off-season acquisition Kyle Calder was sent to Detroit via Chicago in exchange for defenseman Lasse Kukkonen. The Flyers also acquired goaltender Martin Biron from Buffalo for a 2007 second-round pick. Given wide praise for his efforts, the Flyers gave Holmgren a two-year contract and removed the interim label from his title.|$|E
25|$|The {{probability}} of a photoelectric absorption per unit mass is approximately proportional to Z3/E3, where Z is the atomic number and E is {{the energy of the}} incident photon. This rule is not valid close to inner shell electron binding energies where there are abrupt changes in interaction probability, so called absorption edges. However, the general trend of high absorption coefficients and thus short penetration depths for low photon energies and high atomic numbers is very strong. For soft tissue, photoabsorption dominates up to about 26 keV photon energy where Compton scattering takes over. For higher atomic number substances this limit is higher. The high amount of calcium (Z=20) in bones together with their high density is what makes them show up so <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> medical radiographs.|$|E

25|$|Following graduation, Macpherson {{applied for}} a {{teaching}} fellowship at Washington State College in Pullman, Washington. American entry into World War II, which had erupted the previous autumn, was <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> the horizon, however. Rather than {{face the prospect of}} entry into the conflict as a 2nd Lieutenant of the infantry, Macpherson instead chose to enlist in the Army Air Corps. He trained as a pilot at the new Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Maria, California, but was scrubbed from the pilot program following a rough landing during training. He was instead stationed as a 2nd Lieutenant of the Army Air Corps at Albrook Field, located near Panama City, Panama, where he was placed in charge of the base photo laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Although only Mazaki faced {{criminal}} charges, this didn't {{mean that}} the Kōdō-ha didn't suffer any consequences from the incident. Under Terauchi's auspices, , most notably Ishiwara and Akira Mutō, began a purge of the military. Of the 12 full generals in the army, nine were removed from active service {{by the end of}} April, including Kōdō-ha members Araki, Mazaki, Kawashima and Honjō. At the same time other Kōdō-ha officers and their supporters were either removed from active service or sent to positions away from the capital where they would be less able to influence policy. Among these were Yamashita, Kashii, Kofuji, Hori, Hashimoto and Yanagawa. Although other, non-Kōdō-ha officers were also targeted to a limited extent, the focus of the actions was <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> eliminating Kōdō-ha influence. Almost every high-ranking officer who had helped support the rebels during the uprising was therefore affected.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{microwaving}} thin metal films {{can be seen}} <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> a Compact Disc or DVD (particularly the factory pressed type). The microwaves induce electric currents in the metal film, which heats up, melting the plastic in the disc and leaving a visible pattern of concentric and radial scars. Similarly, porcelain with thin metal films can also be destroyed or damaged by microwaving. Aluminium foil is thick enough {{to be used in}} microwave ovens as a shield against heating parts of food items, if the foil is not badly warped. When wrinkled, aluminium foil is generally unsafe in microwaves, as manipulation of the foil causes sharp bends and gaps that invite sparking. The USDA recommends that aluminium foil used as a partial food shield in microwave cooking cover no more than one quarter of a food object, and be carefully smoothed to eliminate sparking hazards.|$|E
