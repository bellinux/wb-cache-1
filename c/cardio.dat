5|$|The tenth {{season was}} the first season to feature only heavyweights and was largely built around the {{internet}} sensation Kimbo Slice and former NFL players.

25|$|Juvenile Dilated Cardiomyopathy is a rare, fatal {{condition}} {{caused by}} an autosomal recessive gene. It affects young dogs, who succumb to heart failure before reaching adulthood. As a simple recessive gene, it had been difficult to identify and was particularly heartbreaking as seemingly healthy puppies would suddenly die, often shortly after joining their adopted families. Since a recessive gene is responsible, that means if {{at least one parent}} is homozygous dominant (that is, it does not carry a copy of the <b>cardio</b> version of the gene), its offspring cannot develop the disease.|$|E
25|$|A {{method of}} {{external}} (noninvasive) fetal monitoring (EFM) during childbirth is cardiotocography, using a cardiotocograph {{that consists of}} two sensors: The heart (<b>cardio)</b> sensor is an ultrasonic sensor, similar to a Doppler fetal monitor, that continuously emits ultrasound and detects motion of the fetal heart by the characteristic of the reflected sound. The pressure-sensitive contraction transducer, called a tocodynamometer (toco) has a flat area that is fixated to the skin by a band around the belly. The pressure required to flatten {{a section of the}} wall correlates with the internal pressure, thereby providing an estimate of contraction.|$|E

25|$|Diaz {{was signed}} to a two-fight {{deal with the}} PRIDE Fighting Championships with the first {{scheduled}} to be against Lightweight Champion Takanori Gomi in a non-title fight on February 24 in Las Vegas. PRIDE 33 was Diaz's first fight in the PRIDE organization and at the weight of 160lb. While Gomi started the fight strong, once knocking Diaz to the ground, and twice ending up in his guard, the Californian dominated the standup battle with his boxing style, picking his opponent apart with quick and accurate jabs and looping punches. At {{the end of the}} first round, apparently due to poor <b>cardio</b> on Gomi's part, the Japanese fighter was clearly stunned, throwing much wilder punches and barely maintaining his defense. At one point though, the fight was stopped to check a cut suffered under Diaz' eye. The second stanza saw a continuation of wild punches by Gomi, then eventually taking the fight to the ground and leaving himself open to a Gogoplata submission by Diaz and tapping at 1:46 of the round. This was the second successful Gogoplata attempt in PRIDE's history (the first performed by future DREAM Lightweight Champion Shinya Aoki on Joachim Hansen less than two months earlier at PRIDE's New Year's event).|$|E
500|$|Burke is {{replaced}} by Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), who immediately dislikes Yang for her trend of having affairs with famous surgeons, such as Burke, {{going so far as}} refusing to let her scrub in on cardiac surgeries. Eventually, Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) moves in with Yang, and she still tries to earn Hahn's approval. Hahn reveals that she dislikes Yang because she reminds her of an early version of herself and continues to cut Yang out of <b>cardio</b> surgeries and neglects to teach her, before eventually quitting the hospital and leaving Seattle Grace without a head of <b>cardio.</b> [...] Without a teacher, Yang begins to seriously doubt the purpose of remaining in her place at Seattle Grace when the program falls to twelfth on a list of the best teaching hospitals, and Burke wins the Harper-Avery award without mentioning her at all, despite her saving his career. Yang tells the Chief that her current existence in the hospital is [...] "unbearable" [...] and that she has turned into a ghost.|$|E

500|$|Hunt hires ex-colleague {{from the}} Army, Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), {{to become the}} chief of cardio-thoracic surgery as a [...] "gift" [...] for Yang, after she breaks down over having no new head of <b>cardio.</b> Yang is unimpressed with Altman, neither {{published}} nor famous, but her calm proficiency and belief in Yang's skills win her over. A conflict arises in the trio due to Altman and Hunt's repressed feelings for each other. Altman chooses to resign her place as temporary head of <b>cardio</b> because of her feelings for Hunt. Devastated by the blow to her education and the depressing potential of returning to her previous directionless state, Yang begs Altman to stay and teach her, offering Hunt to Altman in exchange. Altman intellectually understands Yang choosing her gift over a man and their relationship is repaired, but Hunt is very hurt that Yang would trade him away. Hunt subconsciously tries to sabotage Yang's education and the two break up again after Hunt is unable to decide between the two women. Cristina saves Derek's life with a gun to her head after he is shot by Gary Clarke, a grieving widow who commits mass murder at the hospital. Hunt is injured by the same shooter after he chooses to return for Yang over Altman, and Grey treats him as Yang saves Grey's husband.

Greenblatt was also disappointed with the song's rhyming in the lines, [...] "I'm not here to sell ya' / Or tell {{you to go to}} hell". Sonya Sorich of Ledger-Enquirer said that while she anticipated some negative reception, [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] was also a prime candidate for a guilty pleasure dance track." [...] Heather Phares of Allmusic referred to [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] as [...] "stomping" [...] and selected it as one of the album's best.

Much to his surprise, he noticed how muscular the character was; with only three weeks to prep before shooting, he knew it was impossible to increase his muscle mass to that extent. He was shown video footage of the games and saw how he was visually different, especially in the first game. He did <b>cardio</b> to build up endurance.
