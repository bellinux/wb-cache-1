5|$|Malawi {{has adopted}} task {{shifting}} strategies {{to overcome the}} shortage of workers available for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. Task shifting, which {{has been successful in}} many other regions, involves training less specialized health workers to perform health-related tasks that do not require professional training, such as the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. For example, at Thyolo District Hospital, health workers spend one week learning how to initiate antiretroviral therapy in a classroom setting and an additional two weeks practicing their knowledge in a supervised clinical setting; after completing this course, they are legally (under Ministry of Health guidelines) allowed to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Another form of task shifting involves training health-oriented <b>counselors</b> <b>in</b> HIV testing and counseling, which relieves nurses of this additional task.|$|E

25|$|McKay {{regularly}} traveled {{until his}} 90s. His deteriorating {{health in the}} mid-1960s ultimately led to the appointment of three additional <b>counselors</b> <b>in</b> the First Presidency, as existing members were increasingly infirm and often unable to preside at meetings.

25|$|Among all {{counseling}} specialty areas, public elementary, {{middle and}} high school counselors are (2009) paid the highest salary on average of all counselors. Budget cuts, however, have affected placement of public school <b>counselors</b> <b>in</b> Canada, Ireland, the United States, and other countries due to the global recession in recent years. In the United States, rural areas and urban areas traditionally have been under-served by school <b>counselors</b> <b>in</b> public schools due to both funding shortages and often a lack of best practice models. With the advent of No Child Left Behind legislation in the USA and a mandate for school counselors to be working with data and showing evidence-based practice, school counselors able to show and share results in assisting to close gaps are {{in the best position to}} argue for increased school counseling resources and positions for their programs (Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005; ASCA, 2012).|$|E

25|$|Certification {{practices}} {{for school counselors}} vary around the world. School <b>counselors</b> <b>in</b> the USA may opt for national certification through two different boards.

In February 2005, 30 states offered financial incentives for this certification.|$|E

25|$|But school {{counseling}} in the 1980s and early 1990s was absent from educational reform efforts. The profession was facing irrelevance as the standards-based educational movement gained strength with {{little evidence of}} systemic effectiveness for school <b>counselors.</b> <b>In</b> response, consulted with elementary, middle, and high school counselors and created the ASCA Student Standards with three core domains (Academic, Career, Personal/Social), nine standards, and specific competencies and indicators for K-12 students. A year later, the first systemic meta-analysis of {{school counseling}} was published focused on outcome research in academic, career, and personal/social domains.|$|E
