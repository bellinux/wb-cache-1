5|$|As the goalkeeper has {{the choice}} of how many hands they want to use, the {{decision}} should be made {{of what they want}} to do. A shot should be stopped with two hands either if it is weak or close to the goalkeeper's body, and normally stopped with one in other circumstances. This is because one-handed saves <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ball faster.|$|E
5|$|The first air-raid drills for the Berlin central {{government}} district, {{which included the}} Reich Chancellery, occurred {{in the autumn of}} 1937. The protocol for the drills stated, in part:To carry out the air raid drills, a precise regulation is required for the three office buildings, Wilhelmstraße 77, Wilhelmstraße 78 and Voßstraße 1... The officials and residents of Wilhelmstraße 78 and Voßstraße 1 <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> substitute shelters in Wilhelmstraße 78 and Voßstraße 1.

25|$|The {{number of}} {{syllable}}s {{is defined by}} the number of vowels (i.e., every syllable must contain one and only one vowel) and the main rule can be summarized as follows: a syllable can begin with at most one consonant (except for the first syllable of a word, which may contain up to three initial consonants). It means that a syllable can only begin without a consonant if there is no consonant after the preceding vowel (e.g. di-ó-nyi ‘nut-sized’), and if there are multiple consonants between vowels, only one <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next syllable (e.g. lajst-rom ‘list’).|$|E

25|$|Cornelia calls Dr. Wells back to {{the house}} to examine Richard's body. Dale asks Wells to hide the {{blueprint}} she took from Richard, because the others might think that she killed him for it. Reginald Beresford, a lawyer waiting in his car after he drove Richard to the house, comes inside. Reginald recognizes Jack, and the exposure of her fiancé makes Dale admit that she gave Wells the blueprint with the hidden room. Wells claims that he does not have the blueprint; Cornelia reveals other evidence incriminating him, and Anderson asks to question him alone. Wells knocks Anderson unconscious during the interrogation and drags him into another room. Before Wells <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hidden room, a stranger claiming to have lost his memory after he was attacked and tied up in the garage appears at the terrace door. When the guests try to identify the unknown man, they discover that they have been locked in the house. At {{the end of the second}} act, Cornelia finds the Bat's calling card, a black paper bat, tacked to a door.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo speed {{across the}} Nevada desert. Duke, under the {{influence}} of mescaline, complains of a swarm of giant bats, before going through the pair's inventory of psychoactive drugs. Shortly afterward, the duo stop to pick up a young hitchhiker, and explain what they are doing. Duke has been assigned by an unnamed magazine to travel to Las Vegas and cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race. However, they have also decided {{to take advantage of the}} trip by purchasing a large number of drugs, and rent a red Chevrolet Impala convertible. The young man soon becomes terrified of the antics of the duo, and flees on foot. Trying to reach Vegas before the hitchhiker <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police, Gonzo gives Duke part of a sheet of Sunshine Acid, then informs him that there is little chance of making it before the drug kicks in. By the time they reach the strip, Duke is in the full throes of his trip, and barely makes it through the check-in, all the while hallucinating that the hotel clerk is a moray eel, and that his fellow bar patrons are lizards in the depths of an orgy.|$|E
25|$|China's {{economic}} reforms greatly increased the economic {{role of the}} banking system. In theory any enterprises or individuals <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> banks to obtain loans outside the state plan, in practice 75% of state bank loans go to State Owned Enterprises. (SOEs) Even though nearly all investment capital was previously provided on a grant basis {{according to the state}} plan, policy has {{since the start of the}} reform shifted to a loan basis through the various state-directed financial institutions. It is estimated that, as of 2011, 14trillion Yuan in loans were outstanding to local governments. Much of that total is believed by outside observers to be nonperforming. Increasing amounts of funds are made available through the banks for economic and commercial purposes. Foreign sources of capital have also increased. China has received loans from the World Bank and several United Nations programs, as well as from countries (particularly Japan) and, to a lesser extent, commercial banks. Hong Kong has been a major conduit of this investment, as well as a source itself. On 23 February 2012, the PBC evinced its inclination to liberalise its capital markets when it circulated a telling ten-year timetable. Following on the heels of this development, Shenzhen banks were able to launch cross-border yuan remittances for individuals, a significant shift in the PBC's capital control strictures since Chinese nationals had been previously barred from transferring their yuan to overseas account.|$|E

After acquiring Revere, Phillies General Manager (GM) Rubén Amaro commented, [...] "He <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the order or bottom of the order.

500|$|Author Gary Tillery draws {{parallels}} between Harrison's approach to [...] " [...] {{through the motions}} of living in the material world" [...] and the way someone in the 21st century might play a virtual reality game. Tillery writes that [...] "what we see and experience during the game is actually an illusion" [...] – or maya in the Hindu belief to which Harrison subscribed – and that [...] "hat does matter in the great scheme of things is to wake up from the dreamlike state we mistake for reality." [...] Speaking at a 1974 press conference, in reply to whether there was a [...] "paradox" [...] between his spiritualism and the lifestyle of a musician, Harrison conceded: [...] "It is difficult... You <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Himalayas and miss it completely and [...] be stuck in the middle of New York and be very spiritual... I think one by one we all free ourselves from the chains that we have chained ourselves to, whatever we're chained to." ...|$|E
2500|$|In languages, {{modality}} {{deals with}} the phenomenon that sub-parts of a sentence may have their semantics modified by special verbs or modal particles. For example, [...] "We go to the games" [...] can be modified to give [...] "We {{should go to the}} games", and [...] "We <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> games" [...] and perhaps [...] "We will go to the games". More abstractly, we might say that modality affects the circumstances in which we take an assertion to be satisfied. Confusing modality is known as the modal fallacy.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the world}} at large, Mao Zedong emerged {{as a symbol of}} the anti-establishment, {{grassroots}} populism, and self-determination. His revolutionary philosophies found adherents in the Shining Path of Peru, the Naxalite insurgency in India, various political movements in Nepal, the U.S.-based Black Panther Party, and the 1960s counterculture movement in general. In 2007 Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang remarked that the Cultural Revolution represented the 'dangers of democracy', remarking [...] "People <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extreme like what we saw during the Cultural Revolution , when people take everything into their own hands, then you cannot govern the place".

He also said any U.S. mission in Afghanistan beyond 2014 would focus solely on counterterrorism operations and training Afghan security forces. According to Obama any agreement on troop withdrawals must include an immunity agreement in which US troops are not subjected to Afghan law. [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Afghan people and argue for immunity for U.S. troops in Afghanistan in a way that Afghan sovereignty will not be compromised, in a way that Afghan law will not be compromised," [...] Karzai replied.|$|E
2500|$|Those who {{criticize the}} analogy argue that Israeli {{policies}} {{have little or}} no comparison to apartheid South Africa, and that the motivation and historical context of Israel's policies are different. It is argued that Israel itself is a democratic and pluralist state, while the West Bank and Gaza are not part of sovereign Israel and cannot be compared to the internal policies of apartheid South Africa. According to Gerald Steinberg, the attempt to label Israel an apartheid state is [...] "the embodiment of the new antisemitism that seeks to deny the Jewish people the right of equality and self-determination." [...] Others say that it is [...] "a foolish and unfair comparison", that Arab citizens of Israel have the same rights as other Israeli citizens and that [...] "full social and political equality of all [...] citizens, without distinction of race, creed or sex" [...] is specifically guaranteed by Israeli law. Arab-Israeli journalist Khaled Abu Toameh says, [...] "Fortunately, Arab citizens <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same beaches, restaurants and shopping malls as Jews in this 'apartheid' state. Moreover, they can run in any election and even have a minister in the government (Ghaleb Majadlah) for the first time". Others state that the comparison to apartheid is defamatory and inflammatory, and reflects a double standard when applied to Israel since it does not comment on the human and civil rights in neighboring Arab countries or within the Palestinian territories.|$|E

Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of the Financial Times found that Roberts had pushed her [...] "mainstream pop background to the limit". He explained that whilst many expected the worst from another Girls Aloud band member, he noted [...] "You expect the worst – well, not worse than Cole's terrible albums, but not good – {{only to discover}} that Cinderella’ s Eyes is actually very promising". Robert Copsey from Digital Spy found that without listening to the album the impact would be limited as she had a [...] "troubled start" [...] and [...] "limited solo spots" [...] with band Girls Aloud but after listening to the record he expressed that her transition to a [...] "trendy solo songstress is one discussed with admirable honesty throughout her debut offering". James Lachno of The Daily Telegraph gave the album four stars out of five and stated [...] "Nicola Roberts has made an assured solo debut that suggests she may outlast her flashier bandmates as a pop star of substance", he positively commented on her use of a [...] "autobiographical lyrics" [...] and compared the album to that of artist Robyn. Hermione Hoby of The Guardian gave the album four stars out of five, calling [...] "Beat of My Drum", [...] "infectiously bratty" [...] and positively responded to the track [...] "Porcelain Heart" [...] saying, [...] "her Florence-bothering bellow of [...] "heaaaaaart" [...] on the fearsome [...] "Porcelain Heart", Roberts sounds utterly self-assured." [...] Rick Pearson of the Evening Standard felt that her Cinderella-persona for the album concept was appropriate to her life story calling the record [...] "a glittering pop song furnished with yelping Kate Bush-isms – while Metronomy's Joseph Mount drops by to produce the haunting highlight Fish out of Water.
