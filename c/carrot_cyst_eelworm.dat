50|$|Cactodera cacti, {{also known}} as the cactus cyst {{nematode}} or cactus <b>cyst</b> <b>eelworm,</b> is a plant pathogenic nematode. It is a pest of plants in the families Cactaceae, Apiaceae, and Euphorbiaceae.|$|R
5000|$|Heterodera schachtii [...] (Beet <b>cyst</b> <b>eelworm,</b> Sugarbeet nematode) is a plant {{pathogenic}} nematode. It infects {{more than}} 200 different plants including economically important {{crops such as}} sugar beets, cabbage, broccoli, and radish. H. schachtii is found worldwide. Affected plants are marked by stunted growth, wilting, yellowing, decreased yields, and death. While there are many methods of control, crop rotation with non-susceptible plants is preferred.|$|R
2500|$|Patellifolia {{is related}} to the {{economically}} important cultivated beets (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris, with sugar beet, beetroot, chard and fodder beet). Therefore, Patellifolia is of great interest as Crop wild relative and potential gene donor. They seem to be resistant {{to some of the most}} serious diseases of sugar beets, to leaf spot disease caused by Cercospora beticola, curly top virus, rhizomania, and powdery mildew (Erysiphe polygoni). All three species proved to be highly resistant to the Beet <b>cyst</b> <b>eelworm</b> (Heterodera schachtii). The three species differ in their resistance level, whereas Patellifolia patellaris is not completely immune, but eelworms never develop to maturity in the other two species.|$|R
50|$|Heterodera carotae is a plant {{pathogenic}} nematode {{commonly known}} as the carrot root nematode or <b>carrot</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode. It is found in Europe, Cyprus and India and is considered an invasive species in the United States. It causes damage to carrot crops and is very specific in its choice of hosts, only infecting Daucus carota and Daucus pulcherrima.|$|R
50|$|The female <b>carrot</b> <b>cyst</b> {{nematode}} {{is white}} and lemon-shaped, averaging 400 µm by 300 µm, {{with a pair of}} ovaries occupying most of the body cavity. The male is threadlike, short with a rounded tail and a single testis averaging 60% of the body length. The mature cyst is lemon-shaped, white at first later becoming reddish-brown, with a distinct neck.|$|R
5000|$|Ramsay {{was widely}} {{known for his}} {{research}} on a potato <b>cyst</b> <b>eelworm</b> [...] - [...] the parasitic golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis). The worm was discovered in 1941 in potato fields on Long Island, New York, the only state where it has established a foothold. Around 1946, the worm was found on a {{lily of the valley}} plants imported from the Netherlands. Ramsay helped trace the worm to infested flower fields in Germany that had been converted for potato cultivation during World War II. Inspectors from the Department of Agriculture began testing cargoes of lilies in Hamburg, which initially slowed the golden nematode's spread from across the Atlantic. The Golden Nematode Act was enacted on June 15, 1948, to combat the worm. http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps3025/history.html As of 2003, the golden nematode is one of 22 federally regulated organisms in the United States. http://plpnemweb.ucdavis.edu/nemaplex/Mangmnt/Exclusion.htm According to Society of Nematologists, [...] "he played an instrumental role in reducing the spread of Globodera rostochiensis in the United States."

40|$|Some factors {{interfering with}} plant {{protection}} from phytoparasitic nematodes are reviewed {{in the light}} of changes brought about by the global warming in action. The mechanisms mainly concern changes in temperature and water regimes. The effects of climate changes on the epidemiology and management of the main phytoparasitic species occurring in Mediterranean environments include the alteration of the reproductive cycles due to plants productivity, the geographic dispersion by more northern or higher altitude shifts, the spread of vectors. Other related indirect mechanisms are feedback effects due to the reactions of cultivated species or weeds, and those related to natural enemies. The potential management of some operational tools are briefly discussed, including the development and application of models and monitoring. An exemple of modeling changes induced by increasing temperatures on the <b>carrot</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode Heterodera carotae is briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Brassicaceae Burnett (syn. Cruciferae A. L. de Jussieu) {{include many}} {{important}} economic plants used as edibile or ornamental. They are {{commonly known as}} the “mustard” plant family due to the sharp, potent flavour of their main metabolites, the glucosinolates (GLSs) which contain sulfur. Glucosinolates coexist in vivo with glycosylated thioglucosidases, myrosinase(s), responsible of their hydrolysis with the production of bioactive cognate isothiocyanates (ITC). GLSs and ITCs function as defence bioactive metabolites against plant pathogens, insects and herbivores. The present review paper focus on GLSs role as bionematicides. The current knowledge on the efficacy of these phytochemicals against the most common phytoparasitic nematodes affecting crops of agriculture importance such as tomato, potato and grapevine is reported. Data from our ongoing research on the in vitro biocidal activity of glucosinolate extracts, and their main components, against the virus-vector nematode Xiphinema index Thorne & Allen and the <b>carrot</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode Heterodera carotae Jones are also described...|$|R
40|$|The potato {{breeding}} programme at Oak Park {{was started in}} the 1960 's and has consisted {{of a number of}} distinct phases. In the first phase the focus was on the testing of the main domestic and foreign varieties in field trials in the main potato growing areas of the country. This was followed by a {{breeding programme}} for the domestic market, with particular emphasis on the production of a blight resistant replacement for Kerr’s Pink. The emphasis then switched to breeding for the export market, with the focus on the UK and Mediterranean markets. Since then the breeding programme has been focused on the domestic, processing and export markets. The process of breeding, testing and multiplying a new potato variety from the making of the initial cross until the new variety can be commercially grown takes about 15 years (see Appendix 2). The objectives of the present Potato Breeding Programme are: 1. Breeding improved varieties for the seed export trade. 2. Developing high yielding early maincrop and maincrop types with resistance to potato <b>cyst</b> <b>eelworm</b> Globodera rostochiensis and or Globodera pallidae with quality suitable for the UK market. 3. Developing a high dry-matter red skinned early maincrop or maincrop variety suitable for the home ware trade {{with a high level of}} disease resistance especially to late blight. 4. To select early maincrop or maincrop types suitable for processing into crisps and chips. 5. Breeding 1 st and 2 nd early varieties suitable for Irish and UK conditions with improved quality and disease resistance. End of Project Repor...|$|R
40|$|Medicago sativa L., alfalfa, is {{the most}} known plant species within the Medicago genus. The plant has been {{extensively}} studied for its content of saponins, mainly consisting of triterpene glycosides of medicagenic acid, possessing several biological properties including a biocidal activity on different soil microorganisms. Phytoparasitic nematodes are responsible for heavy economic damages to numerous agricultural crops and, due to their large distribution, {{they are among the}} most difficult crop pests to control. Attention on environmental safety and human and animal health has led to the progressive dismission of many synthetic formulations for the control of those pests and to the search of alternative strategies, including the use of natural metabolites from plants. Saponins from M. sativa may be good candidates for natural nematicide formulations, as in our in vitro studies the saponin mixtures from M. sativa tissues have been found effective in vitro against the virus-vector nematode Xiphinema index, the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita and the potato cyst parasite, Globodera rostochiensis. A structure-activity relationship among saponins and related prosapogenins and sapogenin, respectively, has also been analyzed. The nematicidal efficacy differed among the three assayed nematode species, G. rostochiensis being the most susceptible to the active compounds from alfalfa. The in vitro results were also confirmed by experiments in potting mixes infested by M. incognita or G. rostochiensis and amended with dry top and root material from M. sativa, and in field trials on M. incognita and <b>carrot</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode Heterodera carotae with M. sativa pelleted meal. All amendments reduced root and soil population densities of target nematode species compared to non-treated and chemical controls, with a general improvement of plant growth and yield performances...|$|R
40|$|The effectivenes of {{chestnut}} tannin aqueous solutions {{was tested}} against the <b>carrot</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode Heterodera carotae {{in a field}} experiment at Zapponeta (province of Foggia) in Apulia region (Italy). A sandy soil infested by the cyst nematode was deeply ploughed, rotavated and subdivided in 2 m x 3 m plots distributed in a randomized block design with five replications per each treatment. Chestnut aquoeus solution treatments were: a) 25 g/m 2 in 4 l water/m 2 applied in pre-emergence, b) 25 g/m 2 in 4 l water/m 2 applied in pre-emergence and 30 days after carrot emergence, c) 45 g/m 2 in 4 l water/m 2 applied in pre-emergence, d) 45 g/m 2 in 4 l water/m 2 applied in pre-emergence and 30 days after carrot emergence. Untreated soil and and the nematicide fenamiphos (60 l c. p. /ha) were used as controls. At harvest, number and weight of marketable tap-roots from the central square metre of each plot were recorded. Soil samples, each a composite of 20 cores, were collected in the same central area of each plot. Cysts from a 100 g dried sub sample were extracted with a Fenwich can and crushed to count eggs and juveniles. All data were statistically analysed and means compared by LSD’s test. Treatments with tannin solutions at 45 g/m 2 applied in pre or in pre and post carrot emergence significantly increased carrot marketable yield in comparison to untreated control. All treatments significantly increased the average weight of carrots, {{with the exception of}} the lowest dose of tannin applied before emergence, in comparison to untreated control. No significant differences were observed in the number of cysts/ 100 g soil among the different treatments including the fenamiphos and the untreated controls. The final nematode population density observed in the untreated control was significantly higher than those observed in all other treatments in which no differences were observed. On the base of results, the use of tannin should be favourably considered for plant protection against phytoparasitic nematodes although some aspects remain to be investigated...|$|R
