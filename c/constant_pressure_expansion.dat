40|$|The ISO 1 m³ dust {{explosion}} vessel was instrumented with thermocouples acting as flame detectors. These were used with methane/air gas explosions {{to show that}} the explosion flame was spherical in the constant pressure phase of the explosion and that a reliable flame speed and burning velocity could be obtained. This technique was used to determine the turbulent burning velocity using the same method of compressed air injection as used in the ISO 1 m³ {{dust explosion}} tests. This enabled the mean turbulent flame enhancement factor of the air injection system used in the ISO 1 m³ equipment to be determined as 4. 0. The mean flame speed was measured for dusts and these were shown to correlate linearly with the Kst for that dust. The turbulence factor determined from gas explosions was used to derive the laminar flame speed for the dusts and then using the adiabatic <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>expansion</b> ratio the laminar burning velocity was derived. This gave peak laminar burning velocities in the 0. 15 – 0. 55 m/s range for the dusts investigated: corn flour, lycopodium, walnut, Kellingley coal, pistachio nuts. These were in good agreement with other measurements in the literature...|$|E

40|$|The {{singularity}} {{of specific}} heat (Cp) and related properties (viz. thermal expansion coefficient, αp, compressibility, κT, and pressure coefficient, β) of liquid 4 He at λ−point is studied and {{the accuracy of}} its logarithmic nature as concluded {{for the first time}} from a microscopic theory of a system of interacting bosons is examined. A very good agreement between the results of this theory and experiments concludes that the singularity is intrinsically logarithmic. However, as shown by other studies reporting carefully measured Cp of liquid 4 He around Tλ for |t | = |(Tλ −T) /Tλ | ranging between 10 − 1 to 10 − 9, in and out of earth’s gravitational field and in finite size samples, weak effects arising from earth’s gravity and small sample size round it off and Cp assumes asymptotic nature near t ≈ 0. The λ-transition of liquid 4 He is characterized by logarithmic singularity of: (i) specific heat at <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> (Cp), (ii) <b>expansion</b> coefficient (αp), (iii) isothermal compressibility (kT) and (iv) pressure coefficient (β) [1, 2] with varying strength.

40|$|We use {{computer}} simulations {{to study the}} cooling rate dependence of the stability and energetics of model glasses created at <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions and compare the results with glasses formed at constant volume conditions. To examine the stability, we determine {{the time it takes}} for a glass cooled and reheated at <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> to transform back into a liquid, t_trans, and calculate the stability ratio S = t_trans/τ_α, where τ_α is the equilibrium relaxation time of the liquid.

We also compare the energetics of glasses obtained by cooling while maintaining <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> with those of glasses created by cooling from the same state point while maintaining constant volume.

40|$|SUMMARY. The {{effects of}} {{coronary}} capacitance on instantaneous pressure-flow (P/F) relationships {{were analyzed using}} a theoretical model of coronary flow during diastole that included capacitance. The magnitude of the discrepancy between actual intramural and instantaneously derived P/F relationships was predicted {{to be dependent on}} the ratio of two natural decay constants (central aortic decay constant/intrinsic coronary decay constant). The effects of coronary capacitance are eliminated using <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions. The instantaneous (dynamic) and <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> (static) P/F relationships were compared experimentally using a reservoir to provide <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> perfusion during prolonged diastoles in heart blocked dogs. In the presence of coronary tone, zero flow pressure intercepts (P) ̂ of 27. 1 ± 6. 6 and 11. 0 ± 3. 0 mm Hg were obtained under dynamic and <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions respectively, P < 0. 001. After maximal vasodilation,??s of 14. 2 ± 4. 5 mmHg and 10. 7 ± 2. 4 mmHg were obtained under dynamic and <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions, respectively, P = NS. Pzf derived under <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions were independent of the state of coronary vasomotor tone with a value about 11 mmHg.

Such developments thus require review and consideration for new and/or improved heat exchanger manufacturing techniques. Experimental and analytical study of a <b>pressure</b> <b>expansion</b> approach {{as compared to the}} more conventional mechanical expansion process was conducted to evaluate the impact of manufacturing method on heat exchanger performance. This included visual inspection and comparison of heat exchangers manufactured using <b>pressure</b> <b>expansion</b> and mechanical expansion, physical testing of heat exchanger strength and construction, measurement of heat exchanger dimensions, and physical testing of heat transfer performance. Â Multiple heat exchangers were constructed and evaluated using both the mechanical and <b>pressure</b> <b>expansion</b> methods. Consistency between coils was maintained in order to isolate the manufacturing method, to the extent possible, for comparison purposes. Visual inspection of compared coils and past research (Lee et al., 2014; Kraft and Jamison, 2012) suggest that <b>pressure</b> <b>expansion</b> improves the contact between the expanded tube and the fin, providing the potential to improve heat transfer performance. Visual inspection also suggests that <b>pressure</b> <b>expansion</b> produces less deformation of any internal tube enhancements, maximizing the potential to improve heat transfer performance from the use of such tubes. Â Physical measurements of the tube expansion diameter throughout the construction of a heat exchanger expanded using the <b>pressure</b> <b>expansion</b> process proved that the <b>pressure</b> <b>expansion</b> method delivers a more consistent tube diameter. Air-side testing using water as refrigerant also confirmed that overall heat transfer performance for pressure expanded coils is, at minimum, consistent with that for mechanically expanded coils...|$|R
