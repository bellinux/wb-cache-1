50|$|Patent leather {{is a type}} of <b>coated</b> <b>leather</b> {{that has}} a very glossy, shiny finish. The coating process was {{introduced}} to the United States and improved by inventor Seth Boyden of Newark, New Jersey in 1818, with commercial manufacture beginning September 20, 1819. Boyden's process, which he did not patent, used a linseed oil-based lacquer coating. Modern patent leather usually has a plastic coating.|$|E
5000|$|Bonded leather, {{also called}} reconstituted leather or blended leather, {{is a term}} used for a {{manufactured}} upholstery material which contains animal hide. It is made as a layered structure of a fiber or paper backer, a pulp made from shredded leather, and a polyurethane coating which is embossed with a leather-like texture. Related products, bicast leather or <b>coated</b> <b>leather,</b> are made by splitting, shaving, or grinding leather to reduce its thickness, and then laminating it.|$|E

Baroness Riedesel and her entourage {{travelled}} by elegant caleche, while the Brunswick Dragoons, short on horses, had to march with their enormous cocked hats, thick <b>coats,</b> <b>leather</b> breeches, and jack boots rising above their knees. Captain de Pencier, as an officer, was fortunate to retain his mount. He also avoided the fate of many Hessians: death under American fire by sharpshooters using the deadly accurate Pennsylvania flintlock.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Cow <b>leather</b> <b>coated</b> with {{polyurethane}} film that contains various organic photosensitizers was investigated {{to demonstrate the}} antimicrobial properties {{in the application of}} the material to protective clothing and home appliances. To prepare the antimicrobial <b>coating</b> on <b>leather</b> surfaces with high potency against microbes, photoactive agents, such as benzophenone (BP), 4, 4 ’-bis(dimethylamino) benzophenone (MK), 4, 4 ’-dihydroxybenzophenone (DHBP) and methylene blue (MB), were incorporated into polyurethane-based coating solutions. The photoactive antimicrobial agent treated leather samples were characterized by SEM, color appearance, color fastness against abrasion, and antimicrobial tests. The optical properties of organic photosensitizers indicated that active UV absorbance ranges were different: BP (around 250 nm), MK (around 360 nm), DHBP (around 305 nm) and MB (around 295 nm & 570 nm- 685 nm). The intensity of the UV absorbance curve at the UVA light wavelength for the antimicrobial test showed the highest value with MK; subsequently, this was followed by MB, DHBP and BP in decreasing order. The treated-leather samples demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity under UVA light. The antimicrobial effects for the Staphylococcus aureus were superior to Escherichia coli. Moreover, the polyurethane finishing showed an effective durability to abrasion. The overall results indicated that DHBP is the most suitable PU coating additive to provide antimicrobial properties to leather as well as color and surface appearance than MK, MB, and BP.

The British firm Gloverall purchased surplus military supply of coats after World War II, and in 1954 started producing their own version of the Duffle <b>coat</b> using <b>leather</b> fastenings and buffalo horn toggles with a double-faced check back fabric, and many other modern versions copy some or all of those features.|$|R
