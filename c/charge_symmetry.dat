Following World War II, positive and negative muons and pions were observed in cosmic-ray interactions seen in cloud chambers and stacks of nuclear photographic emulsions.The Bevatron was built to be energetic enough to create antiprotons, and thus test the hypothesis that every particle has a corresponding anti-particle. And, in 1955, the antiproton was discovered using the Bevatron; the 1959 Nobel Prize in physics for Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain for leading the project.

40|$|Recent phenomenological {{work has}} {{examined}} {{two different ways}} of including <b>charge</b> <b>symmetry</b> violation in parton distribution functions.

In a second approach, two groups have included the coupling of partons to photons in the QCD evolution equations.
