2500|$|The <b>colour-fast</b> (non-fading) dye was an item {{of luxury}} trade, prized by Romans, who used it to colour {{ceremonial}} robes. Used as a dye, the colour shifts from blue (peak absorption at 590nm, which is yellow-orange) to reddish-purple (peak absorption at 520nm, which is green). It is believed that {{the intensity of the}} purple hue improved rather than faded as the dyed cloth aged. Vitruvius mentions the production of Tyrian purple from shellfish. In his History of Animals, Aristotle described the shellfish from which Tyrian purple was obtained and the process of extracting the tissue that produced the dye.

2500|$|Togas were {{relatively}} uniform in pattern and style but varied {{significantly in the}} quality and quantity of their fabric, and the marks of higher rank or office. The highest status toga, the solidly purple, gold-embroidered toga picta could be worn only at particular ceremonies by the highest ranking magistrates. Tyrian purple [...] was supposedly reserved for the toga picta, the border of the toga praetexta, and elements of the priestly dress worn by the inviolate Vestal Virgins. It was <b>colour-fast,</b> extremely expensive and the [...] "most talked-about colour in Greco-Roman antiquity". Romans categorised it as a blood-red hue, which sanctified its wearer. The purple-bordered praetexta worn by freeborn youths acknowledged their vulnerability and sanctity under law. Once a boy came of age (usually at puberty) he adopted the plain white toga virilis; this meant that he was free to set up his own household, marry, and vote. Young girls who wore the praetexta on formal occasions put it aside at menarche or marriage, and adopted the stola Even the whiteness of the toga virilis was subject to class distinction. Senatorial versions were expensively laundered to an exceptional, snowy white; those of lower ranking citizens were a duller shade, more cheaply laundered.|$|E
50|$|The {{book was}} used for many centuries for its {{information}} on the splitting of diamonds, how to recognize fake gems, <b>colour-fast</b> mixes for painters, exploration sites for geologists, the hardness of rocks and {{the health benefits of}} certain minerals.|$|E
50|$|Oldenlandia umbellata (called chay root or choy root, {{from its}} Tamil name, chaaya ver) is a low-growing plant native to India. A <b>colour-fast</b> red dye can be {{extracted}} from the root bark of (preferably) a two-year-old plant. Chay root dye was once used with a mordant to impart a red colour to fabrics such as calico, wool, and silk.|$|E
50|$|Batiks {{originated}} {{many centuries}} {{ago with the}} villagers and tribesmen of what are now the countries of Indonesia and Malaysia and has been brought to Sri Lanka by the Dutch. The promotion of the village arts {{is a way of}} keeping alive an important part of a vibrant and beautiful culture. Many of Sri Lanka's batik paintings are imported directly from Javanese village artists. They use 100-percent cotton cloth and all dyes used are <b>colour-fast.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{matching}} set of over-trousers was produced {{to complement the}} smock. Both items were screen printed with <b>colour-fast</b> pigments in a bold Splinter pattern camouflage [...] {{similar to that of}} the 'brushstroke' pattern applied to the Denison. The pattern has a base colour of pink with overlying brushstrokes of plum, pale green and dark brown. Windproof smocks and trousers were worn by French paratroopers in Indochina, and to a lesser extent in Algeria. The French referred to the pattern as [...] "sausage skin".|$|E
5000|$|Galilee: Collections {{reveal that}} there was a {{distinct}} Galilee women's style from at least the middle of the 19th century. The standard form was a coat (Jillayeh), tunic and trousers. Cross-stitch was not used much, the women preferring patchwork patterns of diamond and rectangular shapes, as well as other embroidery techniques. In the 1860s, H.B. Tristram described costumes in the villages of El Bussah and Isfia as being either [...] "plain, patched or embroidered in the most fantastic and grotesque shapes". Towards the beginning of the 20th century Turkish/Ottoman fashions began to dominate: such as baggy trousers and cord edging. Materials, particularly silks, were brought from Damascus. Before the arrival of European <b>colour-fast</b> dyes the Galilee was an important area for the growing of indago and sumac which were used for creating blue and red dyes.|$|E

5000|$|A garment with {{a similar}} {{appearance}} and colours to the Denison Smock, in lighter-weight denim, the 1942 Pattern Smock, Windproof, was also commonly issued to scouts and snipers in infantry battalions, from 1943, but most notably the SAS/SBS/SOE and Commando squads. It is sometimes incorrectly {{referred to as the}} [...] "SAS Windproof". It was not designed much for parachuting, and lacked a crotch flap, having a drawstring hem instead. The most distinctive point of difference between 'Windproofs' and the Denison smock are that the former are hooded. A matching set of over-trousers was produced to complement the smock. Both items were screen printed with <b>colour-fast</b> pigments in a bold splinter design, with colours {{similar to that of the}} Denison.Variations of the 'Windproof' have been the basic Special Forces smock until the present, with several alternative colours seen over the years - white (or at least natural cotton) for LRDG's desert use; olive green; black; and, in now very rare later issues of the Smock, Windproof, 1963 Pattern, the Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) introduced in the late 1960s. The current issue Smock, Windproof is in the latest variation of the DPM design.The camouflage pattern of the [...] "SAS Windproof" [...] was used as the basis of the post World War II Belgian Paratrooper Smock with very similar overtrousers.|$|E

In his History of Animals, Aristotle described the shellfish from which Tyrian purple was obtained and the process of extracting the tissue that produced the dye. Pliny the Elder described the production of Tyrian purple in his Natural History:The most favourable season for taking these shellfish is after the rising of the Dog-star, or else before spring; for when they have once discharged their waxy secretion, their juices have no consistency: this, however, is a fact unknown in the dyers' workshops, although it is a point of primary importance. After it is taken, the vein hypobranchial gland is extracted, which we have previously spoken of, to which it is requisite to add salt, a sextarius 20 fl. oz. about to every hundred pounds of juice. It is sufficient to leave them to steep for a period of three days, and no more, for the fresher they are, the greater virtue there is in the liquor. It is then set to boil in vessels of tin lead, and every hundred amphor√¶ ought to be boiled down to five hundred pounds of dye, by the application of a moderate heat; for which purpose the vessel is placed {{at the end of a}} long funnel, which communicates with the furnace; while thus boiling, the liquor is skimmed from time to time, and with it the flesh, which necessarily adheres to the veins. About the tenth day, generally, the whole contents of the cauldron are in a liquefied state, upon which a fleece, from which the grease has been cleansed, is plunged into it by way of making trial; but until such time as the colour is found to satisfy the wishes of those preparing it, the liquor is still kept on the boil. The tint that inclines to red is looked upon as inferior to that which is of a blackish hue. The wool is left to lie in soak for five hours, and then, after carding it, it is thrown in again, until it has fully imbibed the colour.|$|E
40|$|ColourFAST is an {{alternative}} technique to FAST developed by Ensor and Hall used to extract feature point descriptors from an image based on colour change values. The extracted descriptor is compact and, therefore, efficient to compute and match. The purpose of this thesis is to extend the <b>Colour-FAST</b> feature descriptor from a 4 -dimensional vector to a 6 -dimensional vector to improve feature point matching accuracy. This is achieved by incorporating spatial locality to gain {{a sense of the}} shape of an object alongside its colour change information. The main focus is designing, developing and testing feature point matching algorithms specifically architected for the GPU pipeline with an emphasis on accuracy while maintaining high throughput...|$|E
