50|$|A river bank can {{be divided}} into three zones: Toe zone, bank zone, and overbank area. The toe zone is the area which is most {{susceptible}} to erosion. Because it is located in between the ordinary water level and the low water level, it is strongly affected by currents and erosional events. The bank zone is above the ordinary high water level, but can still be effected periodically by currents, and gets the most human and animal traffic. The overbank area is inland of both the toe and bank zones, and can be classified as either a floodplain or a bluff, depending on its slope. A river bank will respond to erosional activity based on the characteristics of the bank material. The most common type of bank is a stratified or interstratified bank, which consists of cohesionless layers interbedded with cohesive layers. If the cohesive soil is at the toe of the bank, it will control the retreat rate of the overlying layer. If the <b>cohesionless</b> <b>soil</b> is at the toe of the bank, these layers are not protected by the layers of cohesive soil. A Bedrock bank is usually very stable and will experience gradual erosion. A cohesive bank is highly susceptible to erosion in times of lowering water levels due to its low permeability. Failures in cohesive soils will be in rotational or planar failure surfaces, while in non-cohesive soils failures will be in an avalanche fashion.|$|E

40|$|Pile foundations, {{also known}} as substructure, are used to carry and {{transfer}} the load of the structure to the bearing ground located at some depth below ground surface. The main components of the foundation are the pile cap and the piles. Piles are long and slender members which transfer the load through the shallow soil of lower bearing capacity to deeper soil or rock of high bearing capacity. They are also used in normal soil condition to resist uplift forces or in poor soil condition to resist lateral forces. Most of the piles are made from three main types of material which are wood, steel and concrete. Piles are normally driven, drilled or jacked {{into the ground and}} connected to pile caps. Based on a few number of laboratory model results many investigators reported the uplift response of piles in <b>cohesionless</b> <b>soil,</b> a review of related previous works shows that not much research has been done to define the uplift capacity in <b>cohesionless</b> <b>soil,</b> a problem that is often encountered in field.

40|$|The present {{practice}} of reporting site investigations {{in areas of}} cohesionless soils, for roads, railways and canals in particular, is to produce {{a large number of}} particle size distribution curves. The value and meaning of such information is limited. To the Client it demonstrates that trial pits were dug and the soil was sieved, whilst to most engineers a well graded material signifies high stability and a uniformly graded one, low stability. This thesis examines <b>cohesionless</b> <b>soil</b> as a particulate system with the object of establishing a method of interpreting, in an engineering context, a particle size distribution; the simplest test carried out in routine site investigations. Fundamental to a particulate system is the interaction of its particles and this is dependent upon their packing. Of the many variables which govern packing the two primary parameters, that of particle shape and size distribution are discussed in detail and their influence upon shear strength considered. Using published results of porosity, shape and particle size distribution a simplified method of determining the minimum porosity of a <b>cohesionless</b> <b>soil</b> has been developed. It is concluded that this parameter can be successfully employed to classify <b>cohesionless</b> <b>soil</b> numerically and recommended that it serve as a basis for communication between Engineers...|$|E
