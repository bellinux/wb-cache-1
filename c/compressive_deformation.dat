The aim {{of this study was to}} use the finite element method, mechanical testing, and dynamic in vitro cell culture experiments on hMSC-enriched fibrin-polyurethane composite scaffolds to quantitatively decipher the mechanoregulation of chondrogenesis within these constructs. The study identified compressive principal strains as the key regulator of chondrogenesis in the constructs. Although dynamic uniaxial compression did not induce chondrogenesis, multiaxial loading by combined application of dynamic compression and interfacial shear induced significant chondrogenesis at locations where all the three principal strains were compressive and had a minimum magnitude of 10 %. In contrast, no direct correlation was identified between the level of pore fluid velocity and chondrogenesis. Due to the high permeability of the constructs, the pore fluid pressures could not be increased sufficiently by mechanical loading, and instead, chondrogenesis was induced by triaxial <b>compressive</b> <b>deformations</b> of the matrix with a minimum magnitude of 10 %. Thus, it can be concluded that dynamic triaxial <b>compressive</b> <b>deformations</b> of the matrix is sufficient to induce chondrogenesis in a threshold-dependent manner, even where the pore fluid pressure is negligible. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{uppermost}} Cretaceous {{to early}} Palaeogene {{is a period}} of major deformations of {{the western part of the}} Eurasian plate with prominent basin inversions starting from the Coniacian onwards. These deformations occur in a complex geodynamic setting within both the context of the Africa–Eurasia convergence and the North Atlantic opening. While Mesozoic graben inversions have been extensively studied, particularly in Eastern Europe and the North Sea, more gentle deformations that affect thicker crust areas (intracratonic basins and emerged lands) are not as well documented. The objective of this study is to constrain the exact timing, type, and magnitude of the early Palaeogene deformations affecting the intracratonic Paris Basin and to integrate them at the western European scale. Low-amplitude deformations are attempted through a high-resolution reconstitution of its stratigraphic record based on well-dated outcrops and well-dated wells, and a high number of well-logs that are correlated using the “stacking pattern” sequence stratigraphic technique. Two orders of sequences are identified (third and fourth order) and correlated throughout the basin. Basin geometric and palaeogeographic reconstitutions are based on sediment thickness and facies analysis. Two-dimensional accommodation space measurements were taken in order to quantify the magnitude of the deformations. Three phases of deformation were recognized. 1. An intra-Maastrichtian–pre-Thanetian (59  Ma) deformation, with major uplift and erosion of the Cretaceous strata with two sub-periods of deformation: Maastrichtian–pre-middle-Danian and Upper Danian–pre-Thanetian long-wavelength deformations.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} the constitutive modelling of dissipative open-cell structural cellular solids under primarily finite <b>compressive</b> <b>deformations</b> {{and the corresponding}} non-linear finite element implementation. A thermodynamically consistent, mechanistic approach presented in Hard of Segerstad et al. [Hard of Segerstad, P., Larsson, R., Toll, S., 2008. A constitutive equation for open-cell cellular solids, including viscoplasticity, damage and deformation induced anisotropy. International Journal of Plasticity. 24, 896 - 914. ] is adopted for modelling the initial linear-elastic response and the subsequent plateau behaviour. In these regions the cellular solid is considered as a network of struts, where each strut connects two vertex points. A hypothesis is proposed that the vertex points move affinely in the finite strain regime, where the struts buckle plastically. The strut deformation is further assumed to be one-dimensional and depend directly on the macroscopic deformation; thus {{the description of the}} strut response requires only a scalar valued response function. Owing to this simple ansatz, the introduction of multiple non-linear mechanisms, such as hyperelasto-viscoplasticity and damage becomes feasible for large scale computations. An additional hyperelastic volumetric response, activated near the point-of-compaction, is introduced for two reasons, (i) to capture the stiffness recovery at high <b>compressive</b> volumetric <b>deformations,</b> where the struts come into contact, and (ii) to prevent numerical instability. The model is implemented as a user defined constitutive driver in the implicit version of the finite element code ABAQUS and tested experimentally for an open-cell aluminium alloy foam (Duocel 6101 - 0, 40 ppi). All material parameters are determined by a simple compression test, and subsequently used to simulate the indentation of a rigid sphere into a foam cylinder. The model accurately captures the experimental load-displacement relation and the deformed geometry. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
