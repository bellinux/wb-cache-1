40|$|Abstract Background Hyperammonemia in {{patients}} with methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) and propionic aciduria (PA) is caused by accumulation of propionyl-CoA which decreases the synthesis of N-acetyl-glutamate, the natural activator of carbamyl phosphate synthetase 1. A treatment approach with <b>carglumic</b> <b>acid,</b> the structural analogue of N-acetyl-glutamate, has been proposed to decrease high ammonia levels encountered in MMA and PA crises. Case presentation We described two patients (one with MMA and one with PA) with hyperammonemia at diagnosis. <b>Carglumic</b> <b>acid,</b> when associated with standard treatment of organic acidurias, may be helpful in normalizing the ammonia level. Conclusion Even though the usual treatment which decreases toxic metabolites remains the standard, <b>carglumic</b> <b>acid</b> could be helpful in lowering plasma ammonia levels over 400 micromol/L more rapidly. </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Isovaleric aciduria (IVA), propionic aciduria (PA) and methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) are {{inherited}} organic acidurias (OAs) {{in which}} impaired organic acid metabolism induces hyperammonaemia arising partly from secondary deficiency of N-acetylglutamate (NAG) synthase. Rapid reduction in plasma ammonia {{is required to}} prevent neurological complications. This retrospective, multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled, phase IIIb study evaluated the efficacy and safety of <b>carglumic</b> <b>acid,</b> a synthetic structural analogue of NAG, for treating hyperammonaemia during OA decompensation. METHODS: Eligible patients had confirmed OA and hyperammonaemia (plasma NH 3 [*]>[*] 60 μmol/L) in ≥ 1 decompensation episode treated with <b>carglumic</b> <b>acid</b> (dose discretionary, mean (SD) first dose 96. 3 (73. 8) mg/kg). The primary outcome was change in plasma ammonia from baseline to endpoint (last available ammonia measurement at ≤ 18 hours after the last <b>carglumic</b> <b>acid</b> administration, or on Day 15) for each episode. Secondary outcomes included clinical response and safety. RESULTS: The efficacy population (received ≥ 1 dose of study drug and had post-baseline measurements) comprised 41 patients (MMA: 21, PA: 16, IVA: 4) with 48 decompensation episodes (MMA: 25, PA: 19, IVA: 4). Mean baseline plasma ammonia concentration was 468. 3 (± 365. 3) μmol/L in neonates (29 episodes) and 171. 3 (± 75. 7) μmol/L in non-neonates (19 episodes). At endpoint the mean plasma NH 3 concentration was 60. 7 (± 36. 5) μmol/L in neonates and 55. 2 (± 21. 8) μmol/L in non-neonates. Median time to normalise ammonaemia was 38. 4 hours in neonates vs 28. 3 hours in non-neonates and was similar between OA subgroups (MMA: 37. 5 hours, PA: 36. 0 hours, IVA: 40. 5 hours). Median time to ammonia normalisation was 1. 5 and 1. 6 days in patients receiving and not receiving concomitant scavenger therapy, respectively. Although patients receiving <b>carglumic</b> <b>acid</b> with scavengers had a greater reduction in plasma ammonia, the endpoint ammonia levels were similar with or without scavenger therapy. Clinical symptoms improved with therapy. Twenty-five of 57 patients in the safety population (67 episodes) experienced AEs, {{most of which were}} not drug-related. Overall, <b>carglumic</b> <b>acid</b> seems to have a good safety profile for treating hyperammonaemia during OA decompensation. CONCLUSION: <b>Carglumic</b> <b>acid</b> when used with or without ammonia scavengers, is an effective treatment for restoration of normal plasma ammonia concentrations in hyperammonaemic episodes in OA patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: N-acetyl-glutamate synthase (NAGS) {{deficiency}} {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} severe neonatal hyperammonemia. Case report: An 8 -day old boy, who was born of non-consanguineous Iranian parents by cesarean section, {{was admitted to the}} neonatal intensive care unit due to poor feeding, unconsciousness, and seizures. High Ammonia (920 µmol/L, ref. G (p. Leu 391 Arg) and the known change in exon 6 c. 1450 T>C (p. Trp 484 Arg) on the paternal allele. <b>Carglumic</b> <b>acid</b> (Carbaglu®, Orphan Europe Recordati, Paris, France) was started and ammonia declined to normal (55 µmol/l) after 24 hours, {{for the first time ever}} in the patient. Based on the severe neurological impairment due to the initial hyperammonemic crisis and difficulties to access to the drug in Iran, a decision was made with the parents to stop treatment with <b>carglumic</b> <b>acid</b> (while sodium benzoate and sodium phenylbutyrate were continued) and the patient died five days later due to hyperammonemic decompensation. Conclusion: NAGS deficiency, although rare, seems to be panethnic. Thus, in case of hyperammonemia without orotic aciduria but with low plasma citrulline, NAGS deficiency should be considered and a trial with <b>carglumic</b> <b>acid</b> started as early as possible. Our case demonstrates that the prognosis of neonatal onset NAGS deficiency largely depends on early recognition and start of therapy...|$|E
40|$|Valproic acid (VPA) is an {{antiepileptic}} drug {{which is}} used in the treatment of various seizure disorders including tonic-clonic, myoclonic, absence, partial seizures and psychiatric disorders. VPA is usually well tolerated, but severe adverse effects may occur. Hyperammonaemic encephalopathy (HE) is a rare and potentially fatal complication of VPA treatment. The mechanism by which valproate induces hyperammonemia remains incompletely understood but is likely to relate to the urea cycle.

40|$|Four {{children}} in three unrelated families (one consanguineous) presented with lethargy, hyperlactatemia, and hyperammonemia of unexplained origin during the neonatal period and early childhood. We identified and validated three different CA 5 A alterations, including a homozygous missense mutation (c. 697 T>C) in two siblings, a homozygous splice site mutation (c. 555 G>A) leading to skipping of exon 4, and a homozygous 4 kb deletion of exon 6. The deleterious {{nature of the}} homozygous mutation c. 697 T>C (p. Ser 233 Pro) was demonstrated by reduced enzymatic activity and increased temperature sensitivity. Carbonic anhydrase VA (CA-VA) was absent in liver in the child with the homozygous exon 6 deletion. The metabolite profiles in the affected individuals fit CA-VA deficiency, showing evidence of impaired provision of bicarbonate to the four enzymes that participate in key pathways in intermediary metabolism: carbamoylphosphate synthetase 1 (urea cycle), pyruvate carboxylase (anaplerosis, gluconeogenesis), propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and 3 -methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (branched chain amino acids catabolism). In the three children who were administered <b>carglumic</b> <b>acid,</b> hyperammonemia resolved. CA-VA deficiency should therefore be added to urea cycle defects, organic acidurias, and pyruvate carboxylase deficiency as a treatable condition in the differential diagnosis of hyperammonemia in the neonate and young child...|$|E
40|$|The urea cycle {{disorders}} {{are caused by}} deficiency {{of one of the}} six hepatic enzymes or two transporters involved in detoxification of ammonia. The resulting hyperammonemia causes severe brain injury unless aggressive steps are taken to reduce the accumulation of ammonia, which is thought to be the most toxic metabolite. This review describes the current state of chronic management of urea cycle disorders, focusing on new and emerging therapies. Management strategies include the mainstay of treatment, namely dietary protein restriction and supplementation with l-arginine or l-citrulline. Several currently approved medications utilize and enhance alternative pathways of waste nitrogen excretion (sodium benzoate, sodium phenylacetate, sodium phenylbutyrate in several formulations, and glycerol phenylbutyrate), working through conjugation of the drug to either glycine (in the case of benzoate) or glutamine, the products of which are excreted in the urine. <b>Carglumic</b> <b>acid</b> activates the first committed step of conversion of ammonia to urea, carbamoylphosphate synthetase, and thus effectively treats defective synthesis of the endogenous activator, N-acetylglutamate, whether due to genetic defects or biochemical inhibition of the N-acetylglutamate synthase enzyme. Approaches to neuroprotection during episodes of hyperammonemia are discussed, including the use of controlled hypothermia (brain cooling), as well as proposed, but as yet untested, pharmacologic therapies.

40|$|We {{present the}} unique case of adult {{hyperinsulinism}} hyperammonemia syndrome (HI/HA). This condition is rarely seen {{in children and}} even more infrequently in adults. A 27 -year-old female with HI/HA, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, staring spells, and gastroesophageal reflux disease presented with diffuse abdominal pain, hypoglycemia, confusion, and sweating. She reported a history of significant nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which had been present intermittently over the past year. On examination, she {{was found to have}} a soft, nontender, and mildly distended abdomen without splenomegaly or masses. She had a normal blood pressure and was tachycardic (130 bpm). Her initial complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, excluding glucose, were within normal limits. She was found to have an elevated peripherally drawn venous ammonia (171 mmol/L) and near hypoglycemia (blood glucose 61 mg/dL), which were drawn given her history of HI/HA. She was continued on home <b>carglumic</b> <b>acid</b> and diazoxide, glucose was supplemented intravenously, and she was started on levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis. An upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD]) was performed and was unremarkable, and biopsies taken were within normal limits. Following the EGD, she underwent a gastric emptying study that showed delayed emptying (216 minutes), consistent with a new diagnosis of gastroparesis, the likely etiology of her initial abdominal pain on presentation. This was subsequently treated with azithromycin oral solution. We present this case to raise awareness of this rarely encountered syndrome and to provide the basic principles of treatment...|$|E
40|$|Johannes H&auml;berleKinderspital Z&uuml;rich, Abteilung Stoffwechsel, Z&uuml;rich, SwitzerlandAbstract: N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) {{deficiency}} {{is a rare}} {{inborn error}} of metabolism affecting ammonia detoxification in the urea cycle. The product of NAGS is N-acetylglutamate which is the absolutely required allosteric activator of the first urea cycle enzyme carbamoylphosphate synthetase 1. In defects of NAGS, the urea cycle function can be severely affected resulting in fatal hyperammonemia in neonatal patients or at any later stage in life. NAGS deficiency can be treated with a structural analog of N-acetylglutamate, N-carbamyl-L-glutamate, which is available for enteral use as a licensed drug. Since NAGS deficiency is an extremely rare disorder, reports {{on the use of}} N-carbamyl-L-glutamate are mainly based on single patients. According to these, the drug is very effective in treating acute hyperammonemia by avoiding the need for detoxification during the acute metabolic decompensation. Also during long-term treatment, N-carbamyl-L-glutamate is effective in maintaining normal plasma ammonia levels and avoiding the need for additional drug therapy or protein-restricted diet. Open questions remain which concern the optimal dosage in acute and long-term use of N-carbamyl-L-glutamate and potential additional disorders in which the drug might also be effective in treating acute hyperammonemia. This review focuses on the role of N-carbamyl-L-glutamate for the treatment of acute hyperammonemia due to primary NAGS deficiency but will briefly discuss the current knowledge on the role of N-carbamyl-L-glutamate for treatment of secondary NAGS deficiencies.
