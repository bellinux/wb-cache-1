40|$|The {{population}} genetic {{structure of}} the freshwater snail, Biomphalaria glabrata, was assessed in the municipality of Virgem das Graças (Minas Gerais, Brazil), a schistosomiasis-endemic area. The seven microsatellite loci {{that were used to}} genotype 326 individuals from 17 <b>collection</b> <b>sites</b> within a 3 -km radius revealed high genetic variability. However, we found a deficit of heterozygotes relative to Hardy–Weinberg expectations for most of the loci and in many <b>collection</b> <b>sites,</b> indicating a high level of inbreeding. This {{may be the result of}} founder effects and sib-mating. A high level of overall population genetic differentiation among B. glabrata <b>collection</b> <b>sites</b> suggested low gene flow at this rela-tively small spatial scale in this region. However, subsequent analyses also indicated that these patterns may also result from founder events and that an exchange of individuals between particular <b>collection</b> <b>sites</b> does exist. The isolation-by-distance correlation between <b>collection</b> <b>sites</b> of B. glabrata was found to be significant. However, only approximately 6 % of the variance in FST was explained by geographic distances suggesting that there are other factors affecting genetic differentiation among these <b>collection</b> <b>sites.</b> It is likely that the current population genetic structure reflects patterns of both migration and founder events. Results from this study are important for understanding the potential for local adaptation between schistosomes and their snail hosts at this epidemiologically relevant scale...|$|R

Entomologist Robert W. Taylor expressed doubt about the type locality of the ant, but said that the specimens were probably collected from {{the western end of}} the Great Australian Bight, south from Balladonia. Entomologists feared that Nothomyrmecia was extinct, as notable biologists such as E.O. Wilson made attempts to find the ant but failed to do so. In 1977, Taylor rediscovered Nothomyrmecia in Poochera, 1300km (800mi) away from the original <b>collection</b> <b>site.</b> Colonies are found in old growth mallee woodland with many Eucalyptus species such as Eucalyptus brachycalyx, Eucalyptus oleosa and Eucalyptus gracilis abundant.

500|$|In 1947, Helen Gilkey {{described}} the genus Caulocarpa {{based on a}} single collection made in Wallowa County, Oregon. The type species, C.montana, {{was thought to be}} a truffle (formerly classified in the now-defunct Tuberales order) because of its chambered fruit body and subterranean growth habit. It was later noted by mycologist James Trappe to strongly resemble Sarcosphaera. Thirty years later, Trappe revisited the original <b>collection</b> <b>site</b> in eastern Oregon and found fresh specimens that closely matched Gilkey's original description. Some specimens, however, had opened up similar to Sarcosphaera, suggesting that the original specimens had [...] "simply not emerged and often not opened due to habitat factors." [...] Microscopic examination of the preserved type material revealed the species to be Sarcosphaera coronaria (then called S.crassa), and Caulocarpa is now considered a generic synonym of Sarcosphaera.|$|E

500|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the green-head ant {{and other species}} related to it (forming the R.metallica species group) were a source of confusion due to the high geographic variations in the green-head ant and similar-looking species having been treated as forms (occurrence of multiple morphs). These forms have been described under different names through inadequate characterisations. In 1958 American entomologist William Brown, Jr., synonymised Rhytidoponera caeciliae, Rhytidoponera pulchra, Rhytidoponera purpurascens and Rhytidoponera varians with the green-head ant after reviewing the ants in a 1958 journal article. The taxon R.purpurascens was named after its dark-purple appearance by William Morton Wheeler, but R.metallica tends to appear purple around the regions where Wheeler originally collected R.purpurascens. After examining collected specimens, Brown also noted no morphological differences between R.pulchra and R.caeciliae. The species R.varians was described from specimens collected in Darlington, Western Australia. American entomologist Walter Cecil Crawley stated that the subspecies differs from R.metallica by its smaller size and faded metallic colour, varying from yellow-brown in most specimens to a metallic green on the head, thorax and gaster with no evidence of purple colouring. An examination of R.varians showed that the superficial punctures of the gastric dorsum are coarser than usual, but these variants are found not only around the original <b>collection</b> <b>site,</b> but also throughout the southern regions of Australia. Such feature may occur naturally, which disallows R.varians to {{be considered as a}} separate population from R.metallica. Under the present classification, the green-head ant {{is a member of the}} genus Rhytidoponera in the tribe Ectatommini, subfamily Ectatomminae. It is a member of the family Formicidae, belonging to the order Hymenoptera, an order of insects containing ants, bees, and wasps. Other than its name [...] "green-head ant", it is commonly known as the [...] "metallic pony ant" [...] or [...] "green ant" [...] in Queensland. However, this may be confusing, as residents living in northern Queensland call the green-tree ant (Oecophylla smaragdina) [...] "green ants".|$|E

2500|$|Aché foragers {{living in}} the forest share food extensively, and animal prey are divided up communally among band members. [...] Social norms proscribe men from eating {{anything}} from their own prey, and {{emphasize the importance of}} band-wide distributions. In essence, wild game is cooked and redistributed in equal portions to resident families, taking into account the size of each family that receives a portion. [...] This means that successful hunters and their families obtain no more meat from their own captured prey than would be expected by a random distribution to resident families. Palm starch produced in large batches is shared {{in a manner similar to}} meat (but with no overt taboo against women consuming some of the starch they have extracted). Honey is somewhat less widely shared, but large portions are saved for members absent at the time of extraction. [...] Collected fruits and insect larva are even less widely shared but are still redistributed to those not present at a <b>collection</b> <b>site.</b> A hunter's nuclear family usually consumes about 10% of the game brought in by the male head of the household. [...] For most other resources the nuclear family of the acquirer keeps less than 50% for their own consumption, but only 10-20% of small collected fruits are shared outside the family. More recent analyses show that high acquisition variance resources are shared more widely, that the amount of most foods shared is contingent on amount received across dyads of potential sharing partners, and that needy families consistently receive more than they give. Reservation food sharing patterns show that people who are more generous are more likely to receive help and support when they become sick or injured.|$|E
