25|$|The main use of {{pyridine}} is as {{a precursor}} to the herbicides paraquat and diquat. The first synthesis step of insecticide chlorpyrifos consists of the chlorination of pyridine. Pyridine is also the starting compound for the preparation of pyrithione-based fungicides.

40|$|Synchrotron X-ray {{scattering}} {{was used}} for structural investigations in systems of sodium poly(styrenesulfonate) (NaPSS) and dodecyl- (DPC) and <b>cetylpyridinium</b> <b>chlorides</b> (CPC) at various surfactant to polyelectrolyte (S/P) molar ratios. From the Bragg peaks emerging in the scattering curves two types of organization of surfactant {{in conjunction with the}} polyion are proposed. In NaPSS/DPC (all S/P values) and in NaPSS/CPC complexes (S/P {{less than or equal to}} 0. 7) the surfactant is aggregated into spherical polyelectrolyte-induced micelles. These micelles are smaller in size than the ordinary ones. By increasing the S/P ratio, they grow in size, whereas the number of micelle-like aggregates per polyion-chain remains approximately constant. In the NaPSS/CPC precipitate (S/P greater than or equal to 1) a hexagonal phase is observed with a unit cell constant equal to 39. 5 Angstrom in which micelles change into a cylindrical shape.

40|$|Structural {{investigation}} in systems of anionic polyelectrolytes and dodecyl- (DPC) and <b>cetylpyridinium</b> <b>chlorides</b> (CPC were performed at various surfactant to polyelectrolyte (S/P) ratios using synchrotron X-ray scattering. The polyelectrolytes used were sodium poly(styrenesulfonate) (NaPSS), poly(acrylate) (NaPA), and poly(methacrylate) (NaPMA). From the Bragg peaks {{emerging in the}} scattering curves, different types of organization of the surfactant {{in conjunction with the}} polyion are proposed. They depend on the surfactant chain length, on the polyelectrolyte chemistry, and on the S/P value:. (1) NaPSS/DPC tall S/P values), NaPSS/CPC (S/P < 1), and NaPA(NaPMA) /DPC (S/P < 1) complexes produced a micellelike organization of the surfactant along the polyion chain. The NaPSS-induced micelle is smaller in size than the ordinary one because of the inclusion of the aromatic rings on the PSS chain into the hydrophobic interior of the micelle. The size of the ordered elements in complexes with the hydrophilic NaPA and NaPMA corresponds to the radius of an ordinary globular micelle together with the thickness of the polyelectrolyte chain that surrounds it. (2) In NaPSS/CPC precipitate (SIP I), a hexagonal phase is observed with a unit cell parameter equal to 39. 5 Angstrom. (3) The multiple reflections in the scattering curves of NaPA(NaPMA) /DPC complexes with S/P {{greater than or equal to}} 1 and of NaPA(NaPMA) /CPC ones for all S/P values point to some cubic structure. The cell constants of these mesophases correspond approximately to 2. 5 diameters of a globular surfactant micelle. (4) In addition to a cubic phase, a well-pronounced hexagonal phase with a unit cell parameter of 40. 5 Angstrom develops in the NaPA/CPC case with SIP greater than or equal to 1. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of cetyltrimethylammonium (CTA) bromide and <b>cetylpyridinium</b> (CP) <b>chloride</b> on Na+-rich montmorillonite (MMT) was studied. An ad hoc isotachophoretic (ITP) {{method was}} developed for the simultaneous and rapid determination of the cationic surfactants (CSs) adsorbed. In order to decrease the detection limits, ITP was on-line coupled with capillary zone electrophoresis. Adsorption data were analysed by their fitting with adsorption isotherms. The adsorption of CP is well described by the Langmuir isotherm. It indicates the monolayer arrangement of CP on the MMT surface. In case of the CTA data, the best fitting Langmuir- Freundlich model with the power constant r< 1 was found. It {{can be explained by}} the CTA interactions because of its intercalation into the MMT interlayer space...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in stool specimens {{may be a}} predictor of disseminated MAC infection, yet the methods for decontaminating stools have not been evaluated for their usefulness in recovering MAC organisms. In the present study, four decontamination methods commonly used to recover acid-fast bacteria from respiratory specimens were compared for their utility in recovering MAC from stool specimens. Ten strains of MAC were used {{at a level of}} 10 (4) to 10 (6) CFU to seed the stool specimens. Specimens were divided into four portions and were decontaminated by using the following treatments: (i) N-acetyl-L-cysteine-sodium hydroxide (NALC-NaOH), (ii) <b>cetylpyridinium</b> chloride-sodium <b>chloride</b> (CPC-NaCl), (iii) oxalic acid, or (iv) benzalkonium chloride-trisodium phosphate (BC-TSP). The specimens were then plated onto a total of five pieces of selective and nonselective egg- and agar-based media. The oxalic acid method yielded the greatest number of MAC CFU from seeded stool samples; this was followed by NALC-NaOH, BC-TSP, and CPC-NaCl. The difference between the oxalic acid method and each of the other methods was statistically significant (analysis of variance at the 95 % significance level). Although more MAC CFU was recovered from seeded stool samples by using oxalic acid than NALC-NaOH, no difference in culture positivity rates was observed when the two methods were used to test 368 clinical stool specimens processed with either oxalic acid (164 specimens) or NALC-NaOH (204 specimens) (P = 0. 07) or 67 specimens processed by both methods (P = 0. 77). The oxalic acid and NALC-NaOH decontamination methods both appear to be useful for the recovery of MAC organisms from stool specimens...|$|R

40|$|Background An {{increased}} {{frequency of}} occupational contact hand dermatitis among surgical operating theatre personnel has been noticed. Objectives To evaluate patients with {{occupational contact dermatitis}} caused by their rubber gloves, and to describe a method for analysing {{the content of the}} allergens in the gloves. Materials and methods Patch tests were performed with the baseline series, a rubber chemical series, and the patients' own gloves. A method for analysing 1, 3 -diphenylguanidine (DPG) and <b>cetylpyridinium</b> <b>chloride</b> in the gloves was developed. Results Contact allergy to thiuram mix was found in 8 of 16 patients, whereas 12 of 16 patients reacted to DPG. In 7 of 8 patients, contact allergy to <b>cetylpyridinium</b> <b>chloride</b> was found. In the patients' gloves, <b>cetylpyridinium</b> <b>chloride</b> and DPG were detected at higher concentrations {{on the inside of the}} gloves than on the outside.
