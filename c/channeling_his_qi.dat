The world begins to fade away when Tenchi remembers more about his past, and Haruna cannot hide discrepancies of the [...] "perfect world" [...] from him (such as a maxed-out bank account despite her meager earnings and his lack of a job).

50|$|The war {{came to a}} close {{when the}} Supreme Intelligence managed to bring Rick Jones into his presence. The Intelligence had been usurped by Ronan the Accuser, but (as he {{explained}} to Rick in retrospect), he was still capable of <b>channeling</b> <b>his</b> powers through an agent. While the Intelligence cared little for the fate of Earth and its inhabitants, he recognized that the Kree-Skrull war was futile, and temporarily altered Rick's DNA to release his 'full evolutionary potential.' Armed with godlike powers, Rick literally froze both Kree and Skrull forces in mid-stride, allowing the Intelligence to re-establish control over his people and bring the war to a halt.|$|R
5000|$|OverviewLuis Eduardo Aute {{is widely}} {{respected}} for {{the breadth of}} his contributions in art, music, poetry, and film and for an unwavering work ethic over half a century.

[...] It is precisely this type of play on words—a literal one {{in the sense that he}} refused to focus his energy on one creative field and the obviously false one that it is because he lacks self-discipline—that define his work.|$|R
