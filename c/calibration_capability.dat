40|$|The MODIS has {{successfully}} operated on-board the NASA's EOS Terra and Aqua spacecraft {{for more than}} 16 and 14 years, respectively. MODIS instrument was designed with stringent calibration requirements and comprehensive on-board <b>calibration</b> <b>capability.</b> In the reflective solar spectral region, Aqua MODIS has performed better than Terra MODIS and, therefore, has been chosen by the Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System (GSICS) operational community as the calibration reference sensor in cross-sensor calibration and calibration inter-comparisons. For the same reason, {{it has also been}} used by a number of earth observing sensors as their calibration reference. Considering that Aqua MODIS has already operated for nearly 14 years, it is essential to transfer its calibration to a follow-on reference sensor with a similar <b>calibration</b> <b>capability</b> and stable performance. The VIIRS is a follow-on instrument to MODIS and has many similar design features as MODIS, including their on-board calibrators (OBC). As a result, VIIRS is an ideal candidate to replace MODIS to serve as the future GSICS reference sensor. Since launch, the S-NPP VIIRS has already operated for more than 4 years and its overall performance has been extensively characterized and demonstrated to meet its overall design requirements. This paper provides an overview of Aqua MODIS and S-NPP VIIRS reflective solar bands (RSB) calibration methodologies and strategies, traceability, and their on-orbit performance.

In this paper, we propose design-for-testability modifications and acceleration techniques for adaption algorithms to reduce the calibration time required for testing a digitally-calibrated pipelined ADC. For the pipelined ADC proposed in [2], simulation results show that the proposed techniques can achieve a 60 X reduction in the calibration time...|$|R
