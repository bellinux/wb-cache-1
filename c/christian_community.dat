Frankish <b>communities</b> soon added to their number and before Saladin's reconquest, the area had an increasing number of Catholic communities.

5|$|Aramaic was {{the primary}} {{language}} of Syria and Mesopotomia, with several dialects. Syriac was in use around Antioch, {{one of the three}} largest cities of the Empire, and particularly by Christians. Syriac literature is known from the latter 2nd century, spreading from the <b>Christian</b> <b>community</b> in Edessa. Early Syriac literature was produced in a largely Greek intellectual milieu until the 4th century, but was distinctive for its use of rich symbolism and verse forms, and influenced Greek writers such as Eusebius, Basil and Theodoret. Among the earliest Syriac literature was the Diatessaron of Tatian, and translations of sections from the Bible.|$|E

5|$|Christian {{communities}} grew {{quickly in}} many parts of the empire (and especially in the East) after 260, when Gallienus brought peace to the Church. The data to calculate the figures are nearly non-existent, but the historian and sociologist Keith Hopkins has given crude and tentative estimates for Christian population in the 3rd century. Hopkins estimates that the <b>Christian</b> <b>community</b> grew from a population of 1.1 million in 250 to a population of 6 million by 300, about 10% of the empire's total population. Christians even expanded into the countryside, where they had never been numerous before. Churches in the later 3rd century were no longer as inconspicuous as they had been in the first and second. Large churches were prominent in certain major cities throughout the empire. The church in Nicomedia even sat on a hill overlooking the imperial palace. These new churches probably represented not only absolute growth in Christian population, but also the increasing affluence of the <b>Christian</b> <b>community.</b> In some areas where Christians were influential, such as North Africa and Egypt, traditional deities were losing credibility.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{arose in}} Cappadocia {{relatively}} late with {{no evidence of}} a <b>Christian</b> <b>community</b> before the late second century AD. Alexander of Jerusalem was the first bishop of the province in the early to mid third century, a period in which Christians suffered persecution from the local Roman authorities. The community remained very small throughout the third century: when Gregory Thaumaturgus acceded to the bishopric in c. 250, according to his namesake, the Nyssen, there were only seventeen members of the Church in Caesarea.|$|E
5|$|Membership in B'nai Israel was {{restricted}} to men, and attendance at the (at least) quarterly meetings was mandatory. Men who missed a meeting without a reasonable excuse were fined. The members also instituted rules intended to guard {{the image of the}} small Jewish congregation {{in the eyes of the}} much larger <b>Christian</b> <b>community.</b> New members had to be approved by a secret ballot, and existing members could blackball candidates. A member could also be suspended or expelled if he acted in a disreputable manner.|$|E
40|$|Feminist biblical {{scholarship}} has re-evaluated {{the status and}} influence that women held within early <b>Christian</b> <b>communities.</b> Recent studies of the participation of women in early Christianity have come to include texts that appear to provide women with roles of leadership {{and the opportunity to}} participate in activities that were previously restricted to men. An examination beyond the texts that reinforce traditional Greco-Roman roles permits an individual to examine the actual or incidental status, participation and influence of women within early <b>Christian</b> <b>communities</b> as opposed to their prescribed participation found in later, potentially misogynistic texts that uphold traditional Greco-Roman values (Kraemer 1992). In a continuation of this methodology, this thesis will examine the nature of eschatology and its impact on early <b>Christian</b> <b>communities.</b> Through the examination of primary and secondary documents, the research in this study will reveal that women in different early <b>Christian</b> <b>communities</b> were not treated in the same manner. An examination of the Pauline and Pastoral epistles demonstrates that a change in eschatological beliefs played a changing role in the status accorded Christian women during the first century. This thesis demonstrates that women who lived in early <b>Christian</b> <b>communities</b> which held imminent eschatological expectations were granted greater participation within their communities than those women that lived in communities that established permanent long-term structures...|$|R

For ritual baptisms, marriages and burials, the people of Royton, a <b>Christian</b> <b>community,</b> had to travel to churches that lay outside of the township's boundaries, {{including}} Oldham, St Mary's, Middleton, St Leonard's or Prestwich, St Mary's.|$|E

Thanks to subsidies by the bishop, Magloire-Désiré Barthet, and to donations by the parishioners, a new church was built and inaugurated on the Catholic feast day of Saint Anne in 1897. The mission also obtained two adjacent properties, lot #73 on the cadastral map. By the following year, the <b>Christian</b> <b>community</b> had performed 1,100 baptisms, as well as many catechumen.|$|E
