Sixty-five clones were evaluated in a replicated field experiment at Sugarcane Research Programme, Jitpur, Nepal in 2003 for six morphological characters under irrigated conditions. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences for all the characters studied. <b>Cane</b> yield showed positively and highly significant correlation with single <b>cane</b> weight, stalk length and millable <b>cane</b> number. There was also positively significant correlation of <b>cane</b> diameter and number of internode with <b>cane</b> yield. Length of internode had positive non-significant correlation with <b>cane</b> yield. Single <b>cane</b> weight had the highest positive direct effect on <b>cane</b> yield followed by millable <b>cane</b> number. Stalk diameter and stalk length was positively and significantly correlated with <b>cane</b> yield, which was due to indirect effect of single <b>cane</b> weight.

60|$|Meanwhile in the prefects' room at {{the other}} end of the passage, Comus Bassington and a fellow prefect sat also waiting on time, but in a mood of far more pleasurable expectancy. Comus was one of the most junior of the prefect caste, but by no means the least well- known, and outside the masters' common-room he enjoyed a certain fitful popularity, or at any rate admiration. At {{football}} he was too erratic to be a really brilliant player, but he tackled as if the act of bringing his man headlong to the ground was in itself a sensuous pleasure, and his weird swear-words whenever he got hurt were eagerly treasured by those who were fortunate enough to hear them. At athletics in general he was a showy performer, and although new to the functions of a prefect he had already established a reputation as an effective and artistic <b>caner.</b> In appearance he exactly fitted his fanciful Pagan name. His large green-grey eyes seemed for ever asparkle with goblin mischief and the joy of revelry, and the curved lips might have been those of some wickedly-laughing faun; one almost expected to see embryo horns fretting the smoothness of his sleek dark hair. The chin was firm, but one looked in vain for a redeeming touch of ill-temper in the handsome, half-mocking, half-petulant face. With a strain of sourness in him Comus might have been leavened into something creative and masterful; fate had fashioned him with a certain whimsical charm, and left him all unequipped for the greater purposes of life. Perhaps no one would have called him a lovable character, but in many respects he was adorable; in all respects he was certainly damned.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} differences in the energy expenditure and economy of movement of sugarcane cutters with regard to burnt and green <b>cane</b> in situ. The primary objective was to investigate the differences in physiological responses, namely oxygen consumption (VO 2), heart rate (HR) and energy expenditure (EE) and the economy of movement with regard to burnt and green sugarcane during a normal working day. The secondary study was to investigate the effect of the long and the short handled curved blade knives on the cutter’s energy expenditure and economy of movement. The average relative VO 2 for cutting burnt <b>cane</b> and the calculated relative EE were both significantly lower than those for green <b>cane.</b> The average HR during work was not significantly different for burnt or green <b>cane,</b> neither was the maximal HR. Rate of productivity for burnt <b>cane</b> was significantly higher than that for green <b>cane.</b> Energy per kilogram required for burnt cut <b>cane</b> was significantly lower than that for green <b>cane.</b> The amount of <b>cane</b> cut per litre of oxygen consumed for burnt <b>cane</b> was significantly higher than that for green <b>cane.</b> The number of <b>cane</b> cutting strokes per minute for green <b>cane</b> was significantly lower than that for burnt <b>cane.</b> The number of stalks cut per stroke of green <b>cane</b> was significantly higher than that for burnt <b>cane.</b> The secondary study produced no significant differences in any of the measured variables for the comparison between the long handled knife and the short handled knife, except for the <b>cane</b> cutter’s perceived exertion (RPE). Results showed that cutting burnt <b>cane</b> surpassed all aspects of harvesting with regard to physiological parameters and economy of movement compared with green <b>cane.</b> The choice of knives depended on the preference of the <b>cane</b> cutter...|$|R

40|$|Nature and {{magnitude}} of the variation for different agronomic traits in sugarcane under subtropical conditions of North-western Uttar Pradesh was studied. An estimation of heritability and genetic advance of these components under different environmental conditions was worked out. Fourteen sugarcane genotypes in three crop year experiment were analysed for 15 different characters and variance at phenotypic and genotypic levels, broad sense heritability, genetic advance and pooled analysis of variance were worked out. Coefficients of variation were high {{for the number of}} <b>canes</b> per plot, <b>cane</b> yield, <b>cane</b> weight, commercial <b>cane</b> sugar at 8 month stage and for sugar yield at harvesting. The highest heritability values were obtained for juice brix %, juice sucrose % and CCS % at 12 month stage, juice brix %, juice sucrose % at 8 month, <b>cane</b> weight, <b>cane</b> yield and sugar yield per plot. The lowest heritability values were observed for number of internodes, CCS % at 8 month stage, <b>cane</b> diameter and juice extraction % at 12 month stage. Genetic Advance was high for <b>cane</b> weight, <b>cane</b> height, number of <b>canes</b> per plot and <b>cane</b> yield. High magnitude of coefficient of variations, high heritability and maximum genetic gain for number of millable <b>canes,</b> <b>cane</b> weight and <b>cane</b> height showed emphatic role of these characters in clonal selection for improvement in <b>cane</b> and sugar yield.
