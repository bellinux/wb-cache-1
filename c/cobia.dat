5|$|The round ribbontail ray has nocturnal {{habits and}} rests {{motionless}} {{for much of}} the day, often near vertical structures, in caves, or under ledges. It may be solitary, or form small to large groups. This ray is frequently shadowed by one or more jacks or <b>cobia</b> (Rachycentron canadum); these smaller fishes may feed on food stirred up by the ray's activities, or use the ray's body as cover for approaching their own prey. The round ribbontail ray hunts for bivalves, crabs, shrimps, and small bony fishes on the bottom. When feeding, it adopts a characteristic posture in which it presses the margin of its disc against the bottom and takes in water through its spiracles, which it blows through its mouth to uncover prey buried in the sediment. This species may fall prey to larger fishes such as sharks, and marine mammals. When threatened, it raises its tail over its back so that the spine faces forward, and waves it back and forth. Known parasites of this species include the monogenean Dasybatotrema spinosum, Dendromonocotyle pipinna, Neoentobdella garneri and N. taiwanensis, and the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti.|$|E

25|$|Blue runner is also of high {{importance}} to recreational fisheries, with anglers often taking the species both {{for food and}} to use as bait. The blue runner {{has a reputation as}} an excellent gamefish on light tackle, taking both fish baits, as well a variety of lures including hard-bodied bibbed lures, spoons, metal jigs and soft plastic jigs. The species is also a target for light tackle saltwater fly fishermen, and can push 6-weight fly tackle to its limits. The blue runner is used extensively as live bait for larger fish, including billfish, <b>cobia</b> and amberjack. It is considered a fairly low-quality table fish, and larger specimens are known to carry the ciguatera toxin in their flesh, with several cases reported from the Virgin Islands.|$|E
40|$|Generic issues around Teleopsis are discussed: it is {{proposed}} {{to maintain the}} genera Teleopsis Rondani, 1875 s. s., Megalabops Frey, 1928 and Cyrtodiopsis Frey, 1928 s. s.

50|$|<b>Cobia</b> larvae {{metamorphose}} to gill respiration 11-15 days post hatching. At 15-25 days post hatching, <b>cobia</b> are weaned onto commercial formulated feeds. Rearing <b>cobia</b> larvae at salinities {{as low as}} 15 ppt is possible. Fully weaned fingerlings {{weighing up}} to one gram are transferred to juvenile culture tanks. Later <b>cobia</b> juveniles can be raised in ponds or shallow, near-shore submerged cages.|$|E
50|$|Their {{rapid growth}} rate in aquaculture, {{as well as}} the high quality of their flesh, makes <b>cobia</b> {{potentially}} one of the more important potential marine fish for aquaculture production. Currently, <b>cobia</b> are cultured in nurseries and grow-out offshore cages in many parts of Asia and off the coast of the United States, Mexico and Panama. In Taiwan <b>cobia</b> weighing 100-600 grams are cultured for 1-1.5 years to reach the 6-8 kilograms needed for export to Japan. Currently, around 80% of marine cages in Taiwan are devoted to <b>cobia</b> culture. In 2004, the FAO reported that 80.6% of the world’s <b>cobia</b> production was by China and Taiwan. After China and Taiwan, Vietnam is the third largest producer of farmed <b>cobia</b> in the world where production was estimated at 1500 tonnes in 2008. The possibility is also being examined of growing hatchery reared <b>cobia</b> in offshore cages around Puerto Rico and the Bahamas.|$|E
5000|$|USS <b>Cobia</b> (SS/AGSS-245) is a , {{formerly}} of the United States Navy, named for the <b>cobia.</b> <b>Cobia</b> (SS-245) was laid down on 17 March 1943 by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 28 November 1943 (sponsored by Mrs. C. W. Magruder), and commissioned on 29 March 1944, Lieutenant Commander Albert L. Becker in command.|$|E
50|$|Currently, the <b>cobia</b> {{is being}} cultured in {{nurseries}} and offshore grow-out cages {{in parts of}} Asia, the United States, Mexico, and Panama. In Taiwan, <b>cobia</b> of 100 to 600 g are cultured for 1.0 to 1.5 years until they reach 6 to 8 kg. They are then exported to Japan, China, North America, and Europe. Around 80% of marine cages in Taiwan are devoted to <b>cobia</b> culture. In 2004, the FAO reported that 80.6% of the world's <b>cobia</b> production was in China and Taiwan. Vietnam is the third-largest producer, yielding 1,500 tonnes in 2008. Following the success of <b>cobia</b> aquaculture in Taiwan, emerging technology {{is being used to}} demonstrate the viability of hatchery-reared <b>cobia</b> in collaboration with the private sector at exposed offshore sites in Puerto Rico and the Bahamas, and the largest open ocean farm in the world is run by a company called Open Blue off the coast of Panama.|$|E
50|$|On 1 July 1970, the Navy struck <b>Cobia</b> {{from the}} Naval Register, {{and she was}} towed to Manitowoc, Wisconsin {{to serve as an}} {{international}} memorial to submariners. In 1986, <b>Cobia</b> was incorporated {{as a part of the}} Wisconsin Maritime Museum, declared a National Historic Landmark, and placed on the National Register of Historic Places. <b>Cobia</b> is permanently docked at the Manitowoc River's mouth at Lake Michigan, where tours are given daily and overnight trips are available.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cobia</b> {{are then}} {{transferred}} to open ocean cages for final the grow-out when they reach 6-10 kilograms. The growth rate and survival rate of <b>cobia</b> during grow-out stages in open water cages throughout the Caribbean and Americas vary from as little as 10% up to 90%. Low survival rates are mainly due to disease, but also to shark attacks which tear holes in the nets of cages in the Bahamas and Puerto Rico and allow caged <b>cobia</b> to escape. However, better growth rates were experienced in offshore cage farms in Taiwan. [...] In addition, <b>cobia</b> {{are considered to be}} gonochoristic, with differential growth rates occurring between sexes. Females grow faster and {{have been shown to be}} significantly longer and heavier within year classes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cobia,</b> a {{warm water}} fish, {{is one of}} the more {{suitable}} candidates for offshore aquaculture. <b>Cobia</b> are large pelagic fish, up to 2 metres (78 inches) long and 68 kilograms (150 pounds) in weight. They are solitary fish except when spawning, found in warm-temperate to tropical waters.|$|E
50|$|On 20 July <b>Cobia</b> sank {{three small}} armed ships in a running gun battle. One of them rammed <b>Cobia,</b> causing minor damage, but the {{submarine}} continued her mission, sinking a converted yacht of 500 tons on 5 August. A survivor from the yacht was rescued as Cobias first prisoner of war.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cobia</b> is sold commercially and {{commands}} {{a relatively}} high price for its firm texture and excellent flavor. However, no designated wild fishery exists {{because it is a}} solitary species. It has been farmed in aquaculture. The flesh is usually sold fresh. It is typically served in the form of grilled or poached fillets. Chefs Jamie Oliver and Mario Batali each cooked several dishes made with <b>cobia</b> in the [...] "Battle Cobia" [...] episode of the Food Network program Iron Chef America, which first aired in January, 2008.

50|$|The large {{pectoral}} fins {{are normally}} carried horizontally, perhaps helping the fish attain {{the profile of}} a shark. The first dorsal fin has six to 9 independent, short, stout, sharp spines. The family name Rachycentridae, from the Greek words rhachis ("spine") and kentron ("sting"), was inspired by these dorsal spines. The mature <b>cobia</b> has a forked, slightly lunated tail, which is usually dark brown. The fish lacks a swim bladder. The juvenile <b>cobia</b> is patterned with conspicuous bands of black and white and has a rounded tail.

50|$|<b>Cobia</b> {{replenished}} at Subic Bay from 15 April to 9 May 1945, {{then put}} {{out for the}} Gulf of Siam and her fifth war patrol. On 14 May she attacked a cargo ship, but was driven deep by depth charges hurled by minelayer Hatsutaka. Her luck {{changed for the better}} on 8 June, when <b>Cobia</b> contacted a tanker convoy, and sank both a tanker and the landing craft Hakusa. She refitted once more at Fremantle between 18 June and 18 July, then sailed for her sixth and final war patrol. After landing intelligence teams along the coast of Java on 27 July, <b>Cobia</b> sailed to act as lifeguard during air strikes on Formosa until the end of hostilities, returning to Saipan 22 August.|$|E
50|$|Juveniles {{thrive on}} a wide range of protein and lipid, but there are optimal levels where they get the most benefit. After an 8-week growth trial, {{juvenile}} <b>cobia</b> displayed a peak in their weight gain with a dietary protein concentration of 44.5%. Weight gain is also likely to increase as the lipid content in the diet increases. However, levels exceeding 15-18% produces little practical benefit because of higher fat accretion in the <b>cobia.</b> In addition, up to 40% of fish meal protein can be substituted with soybean meal protein before a reduction occurs in growth rates and protein utilization. <b>Cobia</b> has low feed conversion rates, yielding 1 kilogram of fish biomass for 1.8 kilograms of pellets which contain 50% fishmeal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{museum was}} founded by former {{submarine}}rs and civic leaders who wanted to bring a World War II submarine to Manitowoc to commemorate the role the city played in building submarines and supporting the war effort.
