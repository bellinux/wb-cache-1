25|$|Refractory {{ulcerative}} colitis. Patients with toxic megacolon (colonic dilation > 6cm {{and toxic}} appearing) {{who do not}} respond to steroid therapy within 72 hours should be consulted for <b>colectomy.</b> Those with less severe disease but {{do not respond to}} IV steroids within 7–10 days should be considered for <b>colectomy</b> or IV cyclosporine. IV cyclosporine at a rate of 2mg/kg/day and if no response in 7–10 days, <b>colectomy</b> should be considered. If response is seen, oral cyclosporine at 8mg/kg/day should be continued for 3–4 months while 6-MP or azathioprine is introduced. Those already on 6-MP or azathioprine should continue with these medications. A cholesterol level should be checked in patients taking cyclosporine as low cholesterol may predispose to seizures. Also, prophylaxis against PCP (Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia is advised.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{studied the}} results of laparoscopic <b>colectomies</b> {{performed}} by a surgical team on 80 consecutive patients and compared these results with standard open <b>colectomies.</b> METHODS: Eight consecutive laparoscopic-assisted <b>colectomies</b> were performed by Norfolk Surgical Group in a 14 -month period and compared to 53 patients who had a conventional open <b>colectomies.</b> Analysis included indications for surgery, types of procedure, complications, incidence and causes for conversion, length of procedure, duration of postoperative ileus, hospital stay, operating room and total hospital charges, and examination of the pathologic specimens. RESULTS: Many different types of <b>colectomies</b> were performed successfully and safely {{for a variety of}} surgical indications. The conversion rate was 22. 5 %, which decreased to 15 % {{in the second half of}} the series. Complications in patients who underwent laparoscopic operations were not severe in number of type. The length of the operative procedure, operating room charge, and the total hospital charge were greater for patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted <b>colectomies.</b> Patients who underwent laparoscopic operations had a shorter period of postoperative ileus and less pain, resumed a regular diet sooner, and were discharged from the hospital sooner than patients who underwent open <b>colectomies.</b> There was no significant difference in the pathology specimens obtained by laparoscopic-assisted <b>colectomies</b> compared with conventional open <b>colectomies</b> for length of specimen, surgical margins, and number of lymph nodes retrieved. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that laparoscopic techniques can be applied safely and effectively to a broad range of colonic operations. Laparoscopic-assisted <b>colectomies</b> take longer to perform and are more costly, but are associated with less paralytic ileus, less pain, and reduced hospital stay. Laparoscopic <b>colectomies</b> for the treatment of malignancy are achievable technically, but will require careful long-term study...|$|R
40|$|Fifty-one laparoscopic <b>colectomies</b> were {{attempted}} at two institutions. The clinical {{results and}} methods are presented. Seven cases (14 %) {{were converted to}} facilitated procedures, and four cases (8 %) were converted to "open. " Cases of cancer, diverticulitis, endometriosis, regional enteritis, villous adenomas, and sessile polyps were operated. Right, transverse, left, low anterior, and abdominoperineal <b>colectomies</b> were performed. Colotomies and wedge resections were also performed. Laparoscopic suturing was required in five cases of incomplete anastomosis by circular stapler (18 %). Suturing was required in all right, transverse <b>colectomies</b> and colotomies. Operative time averaged 2. 3 hours. Hospitalization averaged 4. 6 days. Four patients had complications (8 %), and one 95 -year-old died of pneumonia (2 %). Laparoscopic <b>colectomies</b> can be performed safely, but require two-handed laparoscopic coordination, as well as suturing and knot-tying skills...|$|R
30|$|When {{looking at}} the shorter {{intestinal}} margin the mean length was 5.37  cm (SD 3.6  cm); with 7.5  cm (SD 3.95) for right <b>colectomies,</b> 2.85  cm (SD 1.18) for transverse colectomies; 4.9  cm (SD 3.13) for left <b>colectomies</b> and 3.8  cm (SD 2.52) for high anterior resections. This differences between the length of intestinal margins were statistically significant (p =  0.000).|$|R
25|$|Diverticulitis surgery {{can be done}} in two ways: {{through a}} primary bowel {{resection}} or through a bowel resection with colostomy. Both bowel resections may be done in the traditional way or by laparoscopic surgery. The traditional bowel resection is made using an open surgical approach, called <b>colectomy.</b> During a <b>colectomy,</b> the patient is placed under general anesthesia. A surgeon performing a <b>colectomy</b> will make a lower midline incision in the abdomen or a lateral lower transverse incision. The diseased section of the large intestine is removed and then the two healthy ends are sewn or stapled back together. A colostomy may be performed when the bowel has to be relieved of its normal digestive work as it heals. A colostomy implies creating a temporary opening of the colon on the skin surface {{and the end of the}} colon is passed through the abdominal wall and a removable bag is attached to it. The waste will be collected in the bag.|$|E
25|$|By age 35 years, 95% of {{individuals}} with FAP (>100 adenomas) have polyps. Without <b>colectomy,</b> colon cancer is virtually inevitable. The mean age of colon cancer in untreated individuals is 39 years (range 34–43 years).|$|E
25|$|Rectum not involved: {{the portion}} of the colon manifesting polyps can be removed and the ends 'rejoined' (partial <b>colectomy),</b> a surgery that has a {{substantial}} healing time, but leaves quality of life largely intact.|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} of an oral live attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi Ty 21 a vaccine to induce immune responses {{in patients who}} had undergone <b>colectomies</b> because of ulcerative colitis was evaluated, and these responses were {{compared with those of}} healthy volunteers. Purified CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells from peripheral blood were stimulated in vitro by using the heat-killed Ty 21 a vaccine strain, and the proliferation and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production were measured before and 7 or 8 days after vaccination. Salmonella-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG antibody responses in serum along with IgA antibody responses in ileostomy fluids from the patients who had undergone <b>colectomies</b> were also evaluated. Three doses of vaccine given 2 days apart failed to induce proliferative T-cell responses in all the six patients who had undergone <b>colectomies,</b> and increases in IFN-γ production were found only among the CD 8 + cells from three of the patients. In contrast, both proliferative responses and increased IFN-γ production were observed among CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells from 3 and 6 of 10 healthy volunteers, respectively. Salmonella-specific IgA and/or IgG antibody responses in serum were observed for five (56 %) of nine patients who had undergone <b>colectomies</b> and in 15 (88 %) of 17 healthy volunteers. In ileostomy fluids, significant anti-Salmonella IgA antibody titer increases were detected in six (67 %) of nine patients who had undergone <b>colectomies.</b> The impaired T- and B-cell immune responses found after vaccination in the circulation of patients who have undergone <b>colectomies</b> may be explained by a diminished colonization of the Ty 21 a vaccine strain {{due to the lack of}} a terminal ileum and colon...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The aim of {{the study}} was to define the {{therapeutic}} approach used for obstructing colon cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the period 1990 - 2002 in the Emergency Surgery Department of the University of Naples Federico II, 81 patients underwent colon surgery for obstructing colon cancer (25 M, 57 F, age range: 55 - 88 years, mean: 72). Were performed subtotal <b>colectomies,</b> left or right hemicolectomies, sigmoid <b>colectomies,</b> anterior resections, temporary or permanent enterostomies.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{surgical}} approaches to treat megacolon, {{such as a}} <b>colectomy</b> (removal of the entire colon) with ileorectal anastomosis (ligation of the remaining ileum and rectum segments), or a total proctocolectomy (removal of colon, sigmoid and rectum) followed by ileostomy or followed by ileoanal anastomosis.|$|E

40|$|Background. Elderly {{and frail}} {{patients}} undergo open emergency <b>colectomies</b> and are {{at greater risk}} for complications. The relationship between frailty and open emergent <b>colectomies</b> is yet unexplored. Objective. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the relationship between frailty and outcomes after open emergent colorectal surgery. Design. Using the American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Program database, a validated modified frailty index was used, along with logistic regression, to assess the relationship between frailty and outcomes. Main Outcome Measures. Outcomes included mortality (primary), Clavien-Dindo Complication Grade > 3, reintubation, ventilator > 48 hours, and reoperation (secondary). Results. The rates for 30 -day mortality, Clavien-Dindo Grade > 3, reintubation, ventilator > 48 hours, and reoperation in our cohort were 16. 6 %, 36. 9 %, 8. 6 %, 23. 9 %, and 15. 0 %, respectively. There was a statistically significant increase in prevalence of all outcomes with increasing frailty. Limitations. A causal relationship between frailty and complications cannot be established in a retrospective analysis. Also, extrapolation of our data to reflect outcomes beyond 30 days must be done with caution. Conclusions. Frailty is a statistically significant predictor of mortality and morbidity after open emergent <b>colectomies</b> and can be used in an acute care setting...|$|R

25|$|The {{mesocolon}} regions were traditionally {{taught to}} be separate sections with separate insertions into the posterior abdominal wall. In 2012, the first detailed observational and histological {{studies of the}} mesocolon were undertaken and this revealed several new findings. The study included 109 patients undergoing open, elective, total abdominal <b>colectomy.</b> Anatomical observations were recorded during the surgery and on the post-operative specimens.|$|E
25|$|Following surgery, if {{a partial}} <b>colectomy</b> has been performed, colonoscopic {{surveillance}} {{of the remaining}} colon is necessary as the individual still has a risk of developing colon cancer. However, if this happened, {{it would be a}} fresh incident from polyps developing anew in the unremoved part of the colon subsequent to surgery, rather than a return or metastasis of any cancer removed by the original surgery.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, FI {{was thought}} to be an {{insignificant}} complication of surgery, but it is now known that a variety of different procedures are associated with this possible complication, and sometimes at high levels. Examples are midline internal sphincterotomy (8% risk), lateral internal sphincterotomy, fistulectomy, fistulotomy (18-52%), hemorrhoidectomy (33%), ileo-anal reservoir reconstruction, Lower anterior resection, total abdominal <b>colectomy,</b> ureterosigmoidostomy, and anal dilation (Lord's procedure, 0-50%). Some authors consider obstetric trauma to be the most common cause.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: With the {{introduction}} of laparoscopic colorectal surgery, the question is raised as to whether laparoscopic <b>colectomies</b> can safely be performed by surgical registrars, when supervised by experienced laparoscopic surgeons.

Clostridium toxins were detected in patients in Bohunice University Hospital in 1956. Thirty seven of them underwent surgery due to toxic colitis. There were 6 total <b>colectomies</b> with terminal ileostomy, 29 subtotal <b>colectomies</b> with terminal ileostomy, 1 coecostomy and 1 axial ileostomy.

25|$|For his New Health, Lane {{eventually}} became {{viewed as a}} crank. Lane's explanation of the association between constipation and illness as due to autointoxication is generally regarded by gastroenterologists as wholly fictitious. And Lane's earlier surgeries for chronic constipation have been depicted as baseless. Yet constipation remains a major health problem associating with diverse signs and symptoms, including psychological—sometimes still explained as Lane's disease—and total <b>colectomy</b> has been revived since the 1980s as a mainstream treatment, although dietary intervention is now {{the first line of}} action.|$|E
25|$|Ulcerative colitis {{patients}} typically {{present with}} rectal bleeding, diarrhea, tenesmus (urgent desire {{to evacuate the}} bowels but {{with the passage of}} little stool), and lower abdominal pain. The severity of disease at clinical presentation is important in determining the appropriate therapy. Patients with mildly active disease will have fewer than 4 bowel movements daily and no signs of toxicity. Individuals with moderate-severity UC have more frequent bowel movements with bleeding. Approximately 70% of patients with ulcerative colitis will have moderately active disease at presentation. Patients with severely active disease will have signs of toxicity with fever, tachycardia, and anemia. Patients with fulminant or toxic colitis or toxic megacolon often have more than 10 bowel movements in a day, continuous bleeding, abdominal distention and tenderness, and radiologic evidence of edema and, in some cases, bowel dilation. These people most often require immediate <b>colectomy</b> because 10% have perforated colon at the time of surgery.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Lane began advocating cancer {{prevention}} through diet, thereby drew conflict with British Medical Association, and resigned {{from it in}} 1924, renouncing his lucrative private medical and surgical practice, 10 000 pounds a year. In 1925, Lane founded New Health Society, the first organized body for social medicine, which German pathologist and statesman Rudolf Virchow had pioneered in late 19th century to undo disease's sociopolitical causes. The term New Health largely referred to nonsurgical healthcare against constipation. Advertising forbidden of physicians, to avert accusation and disciplining by General Medical Council, Lane had his name deleted from the Medical Register. Lane then promoted his views on healthful diet and lifestyle, including greater intake of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, return to farm land, ample sunlight exposure and physical exercise, and nutritional yeast for B vitamins—Lane's plan to foster defecation thrice daily, cancer prevention, general health, and longevity. Meanwhile, <b>colectomy</b> for constipation was abandoned amid low success rates but high complication rates.|$|E

40|$|Many {{surgeons}} were performing laparoscopic {{approach for}} colo-rectal surgery {{from at least}} 10 years. Even some reported results were „excellent”, there are discussions about this subject. I performed {{a review of the}} literature; I found 11 randomised studies wich compared laparoscopic vs. open <b>colectomies.</b> Fesability of laparoscopic technique was established by a randomised multi-center study: operation time was increased with about one hour (vs. open surgery) and conversion rate was 15 - 16 %. The technique is difficult and conversion rate decreased with experience of the surgeon. Postoperative course was better in laparoscopic surgery (from point of view of postoperative pain, postoperative ileus, respiratory complications, hospital stay and quality of life). Laparoscopic colo-rectal surgery is more expensive that open technique. In all this papers, I didn’t find significant “oncologic” difference between laparoscopic and open colo-rectal resections. Conclusions: laparoscopic <b>colectomies</b> are safe for experienced surgeons; laparoscopic technique is indicated in selection cases...|$|R
30|$|The {{two groups}} were {{significantly}} different in what concerned the type of surgery (Table  1), being the right <b>colectomies</b> more frequently associated with higher intestinal margins and the sigmoid cancer surgery more frequently associated with shorter margins. Higher surgical margins were also associated with higher lymph nodes retrieval {{as well as to}} longer length of colon specimen resected (Fig.  1).|$|R
25|$|Those with {{a family}} history in two or more first-degree {{relatives}} (such as a parent or sibling) have a two to threefold greater risk of disease and this group accounts for about 20% of all cases. A number of genetic syndromes are also associated with higher rates of colorectal cancer. The most common of these is hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome) which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer. Other syndromes that are strongly associated with colorectal cancer include Gardner syndrome, and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). For people with these syndromes, cancer almost always occurs and makes up 1% of the cancer cases. A total proctocolectomy may be recommended for people with FAP as a preventative measure due to the high risk of malignancy. <b>Colectomy,</b> removal of the colon, may not suffice as a preventative measure {{because of the high}} risk of rectal cancer if the rectum remains.|$|E

2500|$|The {{syndrome}} that Lane {{reported in}} 1908, [...] "Lane disease" [...] or [...] "Arbuthnot Lane disease", is now usually termed by gastroenterologists either slow transit constipation or slow colon transit or colonic inertia, exhibited by some 15% to 30% of constipation patients. By 1985, Lane's early article on surgical treatment of chronic constipation {{had become a}} classic, while physiologic testing and more accurate patient selection renewed interest in total <b>colectomy</b> with ileorectal anastomosis—that is, removing the entire large intestine and joining the small intestine's outlet to the rectum—to treat colonic inertia, Lane disease. By now, gastroenterology's accepted view is that, although few patients meet the selection criteria, surgery ought to be offered as a treatment option for severe chronic constipation. Selection criteria ought to be extremely stringent, including multiple confirmation of slow colon transit by physiologic testing, and further medical, psychological, and psychosocial evaluations, with patients understanding that <b>colectomy</b> might not improve the condition and might even worsen abdominal pain.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{number of}} {{surgical}} techniques for colorectal anastomosis {{have been described}} for laparoscopic left-sided <b>colectomies.</b> Due {{to the complexity of}} these procedures, open preparation of the proximal bowel for circular stapler anastomosis through a Pfannenstiel incision has become the gold standard. We report a new laparoscopic technique for totally intracorporeal colorectal circular anastomosis (TLCCA) using a circular stapler. METHODS: Preliminary experience using TLCCA in three patients scheduled for laparoscopic left <b>colectomies</b> (two) and sigmoidectomy (one). RESULTS: Side-to-end colorectal anastomosis through TLCCA was feasible in all patients scheduled for preliminary experience. Median time from anvil insertion into abdominal cavity to anastomosis was 14 (11 - 17) minutes. No postoperative complications were recorded. CONCLUSION: Side-to-end anastomosis can be easily and safely performed using conventional circular stapler through TLCCA. TLCCA is performed using four laparoscopic ports without additional skin incision (except trocars incision) and allows the retrieval of surgical pieces through a specimen bag...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Aneuploidy is {{a common}} feature in the colonic mucosa of {{patients}} suffering from the inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis (UC) and often precedes the devel-opment of dysplasia and cancer. Aneuploidy {{is assumed to be}} caused by missegregation of chromosomes during mitosis, often due to a faulty spindle assembly checkpoint. p 53 is a tumour suppressor protein known to regulate the spindle assembly checkpoint and is frequently mutated in aneuploid cells. Aurora A is a presumed oncoprotein, also involved in regula-tion of the spindle assembly checkpoint. In the present study, we examined the mutational frequency of TP 53 and the protein levels of p 53 in a set of 20 progressor and 10 non-progressor <b>colectomies</b> from patients suffering from longstanding UC. In addition, we re-examined previously published immunohisto-chemical data on Aurora A expression using the same material. Levels of Aurora A were re-examined with regard to DNA ploidy status and dysplasia within the progressors, as well as in relation to p 53 accumulation and TP 53 mutational status. We detected p 53 accumulation only within the progressor <b>colectomies,</b> where it could be followed back 14 years prior to the <b>colectomies,</b> in pre-colectomy biopsies. TP 53 muta-tions were detected in both progressors and non-progressors. Expression levels of Aurora A were similar in the progressors and non-progressors. Within the group of progressors however, low levels of Aurora A were associated with areas of DNA aneuploidy, as well as with increasing degrees of dysplasia. Our results indicate that alterations in p 53 may be an early biomarker of a progressor colon, and that p 53 is accumulated early in UC-related carcinogenesis. Furthermore, a decreased Aurora A expression is associated with the development of DNA aneuploidy, as well as with dysplasia in UC progressors...|$|R
