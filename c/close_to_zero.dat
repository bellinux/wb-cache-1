5|$|The river Vardar {{historically}} {{caused many}} floods, {{such as in}} 1962, when its outflow reached 1110 m3/s−1. Several works have been carried since Byzantine times to limit the risks, and since {{the construction of the}} Kozjak dam on the Treska in 1994, the flood risk is <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b>|$|E
5|$|On the average, {{space is}} {{observed}} {{to be very}} nearly flat (<b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> curvature), meaning that Euclidean geometry is empirically true with high accuracy {{throughout most of the}} Universe. Spacetime also appears to have a simply connected topology, in analogy with a sphere, at least on the length-scale of the observable Universe. However, present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the Universe has more dimensions and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the cylindrical or toroidal topologies of two-dimensional spaces.|$|E
5|$|As shown above, E. coli {{can grow}} with {{reducing}} agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as electron donors, and nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The larger {{the difference in}} midpoint potential between an oxidizing and reducing agent, the more energy is released when they react. Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its midpoint potential is <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b> Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available, or fumarate {{can be reduced to}} succinate using a strong reducing agent such as formate. These alternative reactions are catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Rhyolite {{declined}} {{almost as}} rapidly as it rose. After the richest ore was exhausted, production fell. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the financial panic of 1907 {{made it more difficult}} to raise development capital. In 1908, investors in the Montgomery Shoshone Mine, concerned that it was overvalued, ordered an independent study. When the study's findings proved unfavorable, the company's stock value crashed, further restricting funding. By the end of 1910, the mine was operating at a loss, and it closed in 1911. By this time, many out-of-work miners had moved elsewhere, and Rhyolite's population dropped well below 1,000. By 1920, it was <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{rings are}} made of an {{extremely}} dark material. The geometric albedo of the ring particles does not exceed 5–6%, while the Bond albedo is even lower—about 2%. The rings particles demonstrate a steep opposition surge—an increase of the albedo when the phase angle is <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b> This means that their albedo is much lower when they are observed slightly off the opposition. The rings are slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and grey in near-infrared. They exhibit no identifiable spectral features. The chemical composition of the ring particles is not known. However, they cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of Saturn because they are too dark, darker than the inner moons of Uranus. This indicates that they are probably composed of a mixture of the ice and a dark material. The nature of this material is not clear, {{but it may be}} organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the Uranian magnetosphere. The rings' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially {{similar to that of the}} inner moons.|$|E

25|$|Steam {{engines and}} {{electric}} motors tend to produce maximum torque <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> rpm, with the torque diminishing as rotational speed rises (due to increasing friction and other constraints).

25|$|Once they arrived, {{they found}} {{themselves}} in a country devastated by war. Housing shortages lasted until the 1960s, which along with other shortages led to conflicts with the local population.

25|$|A 2015 study {{concluded}} that the low barriers to entry in a competitive market such as coffee undermines any effort to give higher benefits to producers through Fair Trade. They used data from Central America, to establish that the producer benefits were <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b> This is because there is an oversupply of certification, and {{only a fraction of}} produce classified as Fair Trade is actually sold on Fair Trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} (if any) {{between the}} Higgs {{field and the}} presently observed vacuum energy density of the universe has also come under scientific study.

It is unclear how these should be reconciled. This cosmological constant problem remains a further major unanswered problem in physics.|$|E

25|$|From {{the above}} angle sum formula {{we can also}} see that the Earth's surface is locally flat: If we draw an {{arbitrarily}} small triangle {{in the neighborhood of}} one point on the Earth's surface, the fraction f of the Earth's surface which is enclosed by the triangle will be arbitrarily <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b> In this case the angle sum formula simplifies to 180°, which we know is what Euclidean geometry tells us for triangles on a flat surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{monetary}} explanation has two weaknesses. First it is {{not able}} to explain why the demand for money was falling more rapidly than the supply during the initial downturn in 1930–31.

These questions are addressed by modern explanations that build on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz but add non-monetary explanations.|$|E

50|$|Once {{all of the}} cubes {{have been}} {{auctioned}} off, players find the grand total of the cubes they accumulated. If a player acquired one or more consecutive numbers, the lowest negative number (that is, the one <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero)</b> {{is the only one}} that is counted. One point is also added to the total for every chip the player has at the end of the auction. (eg: a -5 cube, a -6 cube, a -10 cube, and three chips would total -12.) The player with the lowest negative total (<b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero)</b> wins five garnets, two Tokens, and a clue for the Token of Immortality if it has not been found yet. The player with the highest negative total (furthest from zero) is the Death Match candidate.|$|R
