5|$|For {{lines with}} three or four tracks with express service, local stops will have side {{platforms}} and the middle one or two tracks will not stop at the station. On these lines, express stations typically have two island platforms, one for the local and express in one direction, and another for the local and express in the other direction. Each island platform provides a <b>cross-platform</b> <b>interchange</b> between local and express services. Some lines with four-track express service have two tracks each on two levels and use both island and side platforms.|$|E
5|$|The Brook Avenue station {{just east}} of Third Avenue–138th Street on the IRT Pelham Line would be reconstructed to allow a <b>cross-platform</b> <b>interchange.</b> Further north, {{there would be a}} {{connection}} with the IRT Pelham Line near Westchester Avenue at the Whitlock Avenue station, and station platforms north to Pelham Bay Park would be narrowed and lengthened to accommodate the longer and wider B Division trains from the Second Avenue Subway. IRT local service on the Pelham Line would terminate at Hunts Point Avenue one stop south.|$|E
5|$|The Central {{line station}} opened on 30 July 1900, and the Bakerloo line station on 10 March 1906. Both are Grade II listed. The station was rebuilt in 1912 to relieve {{congestion}}. Further congestion {{led to another}} reconstruction in 1923. Numerous improvements were made {{as part of the}} New Works Programme and as a flood protection measure. To accommodate additional passengers on the Victoria line, a new ticket hall was built.

5|$|A {{proposal}} for a new underground railway running from Victoria to Walthamstow was first proposed by a Working Party {{set up by the}} British Transport Commission in 1948, though that largely followed a 1946 plan for an East Croydon to Finsbury Park line. A route was approved in 1955 with future extensions to be decided later, though funding for the construction was not approved by the government until 1962. Construction began in 1962 on the initial Walthamstow to Victoria section. The Victoria line platforms opened on 7 March 1969. The station opened as part of a second extension from Warren Street to Victoria. <b>Cross-platform</b> <b>interchange</b> between the Bakerloo and Victoria lines was provided by constructing the Victoria line platforms parallel to the Bakerloo ones.|$|E
5|$|At Euston, major {{reconstruction}} {{works were}} undertaken {{to incorporate the}} new Victoria line platforms so that cross-platform interchanges could be provided with the Northern line's Bank branch—the former C route to King's Cross and Bank. Unlike the former CCE platforms, which were in separate tunnels with side platforms, the Bank branch tracks served an island platform in a single large tunnel. These platforms suffered from dangerous overcrowding at peak times. To provide <b>cross-platform</b> <b>interchange,</b> a new section of tunnel was constructed for northbound Bank branch trains, which were diverted to a new platform south of the original alignment. The redundant northbound track bed in the station tunnel was filled in to form a wider southbound platform. The new Victoria line platforms were excavated between and parallel to the original and the new Bank branch tunnels. Each pair of platforms was linked via a concourse served by escalators.|$|E

25|$|Under the South station, the premetro and metro tracks swap {{from running}} {{on the right to}} {{running on the}} left where they run {{parallel}} to provide <b>cross-platform</b> <b>interchange</b> between the two lines.
