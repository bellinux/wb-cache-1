With the increase of dam height, high <b>confining</b> pressure and complex stress states complicate the shear behavior of coarse aggregates, and thus impede the high dam's proper construction, operation and maintenance. An experimental program was conducted to study the shear behavior of dam coarse aggregates using a large-scale triaxial shear apparatus. Through triaxial shear tests, the strain-stress behaviors of aggregates were observed under constant <b>confining</b> pressures: 300 kPa, 600 kPa, 900 kPa and 1200 kPa. Shear strengths and aggregate breakage characteristics associated with high pressure shear processes are discussed. Stress path tests were conducted to observe and analyze coarse aggregate response under complex stress states. In triaxial shear tests, {{it was found that}} peak deviator stresses increase along with <b>confining</b> pressures, whereas the peak principal stress ratios decrease as <b>confining</b> pressures increase. With increasing <b>confining</b> pressures, the dilation decreases and the contraction eventually prevails.

40|$|Brittleness indices (BI) {{commonly}} used in the petroleum industry are based on elastic modulus or mineralogy that can be calculated from well logs. However, they both ignore the effect of <b>confining</b> pressure. Shale is usually distributed at different depth under different <b>confining</b> pressure. Models without considering the influence of <b>confining</b> pressure will directly lead to inaccuracy in BI calculation, thus resulting in the failure of hydraulic fracturing. In this work, we compared <b>confining</b> pressure with rock mechanics parameters and the microcrack quantity of a core, introduced "fracture toughness" to explain how <b>confining</b> pressure influences BI, and finally developed a new model to correct the effect of <b>confining</b> pressure in BI calculation. Fracture toughness is an important parameter that characterizing a rock’s resistance to a fracture. It increases with <b>confining</b> pressure, since an increase of <b>confining</b> pressure may close preexisting cracks and restrict the crack propagation. The results show that BI is usually larger at low <b>confining</b> pressure than at high pressure. Also, higher content in brittle mineral {{does not necessarily mean}} brittler. The results calculated by the new model, which considers the influence of Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, tensile strength, <b>confining</b> pressure and fracture toughness in BI calculation, match well with experimental results.

30|$|Three {{different}} types of triaxial tests were performed: (1) pore pressure stepping tests at variable pore pressure conditions. During the pore pressure stepping tests, the <b>confining</b> pressure (σ 3) was held constant at 55 and 65  MPa, respectively. The pore pressure was decreased in three steps from 80 % to 50 % and 25 % of the <b>confining</b> pressure or from 90 % to 60 % and 30 % of the <b>confining</b> pressure, respectively. This allowed examining the peak strength at different effective <b>confining</b> pressure conditions. (2) In the <b>confining</b> pressure stepping tests, deformation tests were conducted at up to five different <b>confining</b> pressures. In these tests, the <b>confining</b> pressure was increased in each deformation phase in 10 -MPa steps up to five times from 25 to 65  MPa, while the pore pressure was generally 80 % of the <b>confining</b> pressure. <b>Confining</b> pressure stepping tests allow {{the determination of the}} peak strength at different <b>confining</b> pressure conditions of a sample. Deformation was stopped at the yield point in the pre-failure phase (Kovári and Tisa 1975) to avoid damage of the specimen and permit multiple tests. This procedure allows calculations of Mohr envelopes from the data to derive cohesion and angles of internal friction. Also, the influence of the variable pore pressure conditions can be studied in these tests. (3) A cyclic test (18  cycles) at constant <b>confining</b> pressure and constant pore pressure: In this test, <b>confining</b> pressure and pore pressure were kept constant (σ 3 [*]=[*] 55  MPa, pore pressure = 80 % of σ 3). The sample was cyclically loaded to a differential stress of 70  MPa. After the holding times, the axial load was decreased. This procedure was repeated 18 times. The cyclic test allows simulation of the effect of cyclic loading during earthquake cycles.|$|R
