5|$|DST's clock shifts {{have the}} obvious {{disadvantage}} of complexity. People must remember {{to change their}} clocks; this can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely. People who work across time zone boundaries need {{to keep track of}} multiple DST rules, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way. The length of the <b>calendar</b> <b>day</b> becomes variable; it is no longer always 24 hours. Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and can be expensive. During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock reads times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 twice, possibly leading to confusion.|$|E
5|$|In the Mid-Atlantic, {{the weather}} event broke the 24-hour {{rainfall}} record for September30 at several locations: the Norfolk, Baltimore–Washington, and Ronald Reagan Washington airports recorded 7.85in (199mm), 6.02in (153mm), and 4.66in (118mm) respectively. In Maryland, two buses collided amid the stormy weather, injuring 26of their passengers. With localized estimates {{of up to}} 8in (200mm), the state of New York experienced {{some of its most}} historic rainfall; an official total 4.24in (108mm) shattered the 24-hour record for any <b>calendar</b> <b>day</b> in Binghamtom. Flash floods throughout the state resulted in one drowning death and US$10,000 in damage. Considerable flooding also occurred in Vermont and Pennsylvania, with a 24-hour rainfall maximum of 10.5in (265mm) in Moscow. Farther north, the remnant low enhanced a pressure gradient over southern New England, generating strong winds that knocked out the power in Litchfield County. Rainfall there additionally caused minor flooding. In Quebec, torrents following 3.5in (90mm) of rainfall inundated basements and caused two drownings. Despite the deaths and damage, the rains lightened prolonged drought conditions in those regions.|$|E

25|$|West Haven {{was built}} as War Flame in Seattle, Washington in 1917 at Plant No. 1 of the Skinner & Eddy Corporation. A {{product of the}} United States Shipping Boards {{emergency}} wartime shipbuilding program, War Flame was laid down on 13 August 1917 and launched on 1 November 1917 {{in what was then}} apparently a new world keel-to-launch record of just 67 working <b>days</b> (81 <b>calendar</b> <b>days).</b> The ship was completed an additional 43 working (54 <b>calendar)</b> <b>days</b> later on 24 December 1917—a keel-to-delivery time of 110 working <b>days</b> (135 <b>calendar</b> <b>days),</b> establishing a new company record.|$|R

25|$|The International Date Line (IDL) is an {{imaginary}} line of navigation {{on the surface}} of the Earth that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole and demarcates the change of one <b>calendar</b> <b>day</b> to the next.

25|$|The {{international}} date line in Judaism {{is used to}} demarcate {{the change}} of one <b>calendar</b> <b>day</b> to the next in the Jewish calendar. The Jewish calendar defines days as running from sundown to sundown rather than midnight to midnight. So {{in the context of}} Judaism, an international date line demarcates when the line of sundown moving across the Earth's surface stops being the sundown ending and starting one day and starts being the sundown ending and starting the following day.|$|E
25|$|While talking out {{a measure}} {{is the most}} common form of {{filibuster}} in the Senate, other means of delaying and killing legislation are available. Because the Senate routinely conducts business by unanimous consent, one member can create at least some delay by objecting to the request. In some cases, such as considering a bill or resolution on the day it is introduced or brought from the House, the delay can be as long as a day. However, because this is a legislative day, not a <b>calendar</b> <b>day,</b> the majority can mitigate it by briefly adjourning.|$|E
25|$|In 1999 Jeremy Gilley desired {{there be}} one single day when all {{countries}} {{vowed not to}} wage war: a worldwide ceasefire and day of non-violence. He established Peace One Day. The UN had already declared the third Tuesday of September the International Day of Peace, Peace One Day aimed to resolve the confusion on which <b>calendar</b> <b>day</b> it fell, and on 7 September 2001, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution formally establishing the UN International Day of Peace an annual Peace Day of global ceasefire and non-violence on 21 September.|$|E

25|$|The {{rules of}} the Senate provide that no senator may make more than two speeches on a motion or bill on the same {{legislative}} day. A legislative day begins when the Senate convenes and ends with adjournment; hence, {{it does not necessarily}} coincide with the <b>calendar</b> <b>day.</b> The length of these speeches is not limited by the rules; thus, in most cases, senators may speak {{for as long as they}} please. Often, the Senate adopts unanimous consent agreements imposing time limits. In other cases (for example, for the budget process), limits are imposed by statute. However, the right to unlimited debate is generally preserved.|$|E
25|$|Mystery/puzzle caches require one to {{discover}} information or solve a puzzle {{to find the}} cache. Some mystery caches provide a false set of coordinates with a puzzle that must be solved to determine the final cache location. In other cases, the given location is accurate, but {{the name of the}} location or other features are themselves a puzzle leading to the final cache. Alternatively, additional information is necessary to complete the find, such as a padlock combination to access the cache. Finally, Challenge Caches, (a subtype of the Mystery cache) require a geocacher to complete a reasonably attainable geocaching-related task before being able to log the find. Examples include finding a number of caches that meet a category, completing a number of cache finds within a period of time, or finding a cache for every <b>calendar</b> <b>day,</b> etc.|$|E
25|$|Under Pearson's replacement, Claudio Ranieri, Leicester sat top of {{the table}} on Christmas Day. Despite their great start, the team did not keep a clean sheet in their first nine games, {{prompting}} Ranieri to offer to buy the squad pizza for their first. The team finally managed their first clean sheet {{of the season in}} their tenth game, against Crystal Palace. The team improved defensively, and Schmeichel kept his 12th clean sheet of the season in the reverse fixture against Palace on 19 March. On 2 May 2016, he won the Premier League title at 29 years of age, the same age and same <b>calendar</b> <b>day</b> when his father won Manchester United's first such title in 1993. On both occasions, the respective teams (Manchester United and Leicester City) clinched the titles by nearest rivals (Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur) not winning. The Schmeichels became the only biological father and son to win the Premier League.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} was {{operated by}} turning a small hand crank (now lost) which was linked via {{a crown gear}} to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible {{on the front of}} fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian <b>calendar</b> <b>day.</b> The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian ephemeris tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the Sun and Moon, the moon phase, eclipse, and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of planets.|$|E
25|$|Philadelphia took a 1–0 lead in {{the bottom}} of the first inning, as Jimmy Rollins led off with a double and scored when Pat Burrell later walked with the bases loaded. The Phillies doubled their {{lead in the}} third inning when Chase Utley reached base on a fielding error and scored on Pedro Feliz's single. The Rays scored their first run when Carl Crawford hit a solo home run in the top of the fourth inning. Ryan Howard's three-run home run {{in the bottom of}} the inning brought the score to 5–1. Tampa Bay's Eric Hinske hit a pinch-hit home run to bring the Rays within three runs, but Phillies pitcher Joe Blanton responded with a home run of his own to re-extend the lead to four; it was the first time a pitcher hit a home run in the World Series since Ken Holtzman in game 4 of the 1974 World Series. Blanton pitched six innings, giving up two runs on four hits to acquire his first win of the Series. Jayson Werth hit a two-run home run in the eighth inning—the Phillies third of the game—to bring the score to 8–2. Later in the inning Ryan Howard's second home run, and fifth RBI, {{increased}} the Phillies lead to eight runs. Philadelphia's four relief pitchers combined for three shutout innings, giving up one hit. Due to the late completion of the previous game, Games 3 and 4 each ended on the same <b>calendar</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
