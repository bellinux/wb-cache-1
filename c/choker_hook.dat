5000|$|Wirkkala invented and {{developed}} the high lead method of logging. This skyline (or [...] "spar") method, ideally suited for steep terrain, revolutionized the industry. He also invented important pieces of that industry's machinery {{used during the}} first half of the 20th century, including the ubiquitous <b>choker</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E
50|$|During {{its first}} 30 years, ESCO was mainly a {{regional}} supplier of cast steel alloy {{products for the}} logging, construction, and {{pulp and paper industry}} throughout the Pacific Northwest. In the 1920s, the company expanded production to include cast steel alloy products like the Bardon <b>choker</b> <b>hook,</b> widely used in forestry. Further growth was sparked by the use of Hadfield manganese steel and the production of dragline excavator buckets. The ESCO trademark was first used in 1926 and eventually became the companyâ€™s new name.|$|E
50|$|His {{first patent}} was granted in 1917, and {{was for a}} four-drum donkey engine used in his high lead logging system. In the {{following}} years, several of his patented devices were manufactured, under the Wirkkala brand, at the Willapa Harbor Iron Works in South Bend. A few of his patented inventions were still in manufacture well into {{the second half of}} the 20th century. Wirkkala sued his own patent attorney for patent infringement on the <b>choker</b> <b>hook,</b> and after several years of litigation the suit was decided in Wirkkala's favor. Later, Wirkkala developed and patented a marine propeller. In the course of his career he patented at least 18 different inventions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a time-study conducted near Grand Ronde, Oregon, to determine the production rates and total harvesting costs of a cable thinning in a young stand. The stand had a species mix of 48 percent western hemlock (Tsuga. heterophylla- (Raf.) Sarg.), 45 percent Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga meuziesil (Mirb.) Franco), and 7 percent white fir (Abies concolor (Gord. & Fiend.) Lindi.). The stand had an average age of 33 years, with a mean dbh of the total stand (over 1. 5 inches (3. 8 i cm) dbh) of 5. 7 inches (14. 48 cm). The mean dbh of the merchantable stems (over 6 inches (15. 84 cm) dbh) was 8. 3 inches. The yarder belonged to the small size class of yarders, and was rigged with a live skyline system using a selfclamping, manual slack-puliing carriage. Three hooking techniques consisting of three chokers with sliders, presetting three ring chokers andusing a toggle hook, and flying six ring chokers per turn were compared on a production basis. Regression equations were developed for the individual elements of the yarding cycles and for total cycle times ftr each hooking technique. Results indicate that there is {{no significant difference between the}} production rates of three chokers and sliders compared with three preset ring chokers and a toggle hook. There was a significant difierence between the production rates when using the three chokers and sliders compared with using six ring chokers and a toggle hook. The six ring <b>chokers</b> and toggle <b>hook</b> was about 13 percent faster per MBP. The total harvesting cost was compared with the mill value of the timber. The total harvesting cost included felling, limbing, and bucking cost, equipment move-in and move-out cost, yarding cost, loading cost, and hauling cost. Not included in the harvesting cost was road costs, engineering and layout costs, timber tax costs, or any profit and risk costs. The total harvesting cost came to 227. 90 per MBP. The weighted average mill price for the logs was 250. 24 per MBP...|$|R
