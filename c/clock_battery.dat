50|$|Unlike {{previous}} Amiga models, early A4000 machines {{have the}} CPU mounted in an expansion board; the motherboard {{does not have}} an integrated CPU. Later revisions of the A4000 have the CPU and 2 MB RAM surface-mounted on the motherboard in an effort to reduce costs. These machines are known as the A4000-CR (cost-reduced) and the surface-mounted CPU is a 68EC030. The cost-reduced models also make use of a non-rechargeable lithium battery for real-time <b>clock</b> <b>battery</b> backup rather than a rechargeable NiCd battery. The NiCd backup battery {{is one of the most}} common causes of problems in an aging device that uses one because it has a tendency to eventually leak. The released fluids are somewhat corrosive and can eventually damage the circuitry.|$|E
50|$|The memory battery (aka motherboard, CMOS, {{real-time}} clock (RTC), <b>clock</b> <b>battery)</b> is generally a CR2032 lithium coin cell. This cell battery has an estimated life of 3 years when {{power supply unit}} (PSU) is unplugged or when the PSU power switch is turned off. Other common battery cell types can last significantly longer or shorter periods, such as the smaller CR2016 which will generally last about 40% less time than CR2032. Higher temperatures and longer power-off time will shorten battery cell life. When replacing battery cell, the system time and CMOS BIOS settings may revert to default values. Unwanted BIOS reset may be avoided by replacing battery cell with PSU power switch turned on and plugged into electric socket on the wall. On ATX motherboards, turning on power switch on PSU, will supply 5V standby power to the motherboard to keep CMOS memory energized during computer turned off period.|$|E

5000|$|In {{terms of}} hardware, the new {{motherboard}} is a cleaner design that drew less power and resolved audio noise issues that {{interfered with the}} Ensoniq synthesizer in the original motherboard. Over four times more RAM is built-in, with double the ROM size, and an enhanced ADB microcontroller provides native support for sticky keys, mouse emulation, and keyboard LED support (available on extended keyboards). Hardware shadowing of Text Page 2 was introduced, improving compatibility and performance with the classic Apple II video mode. The <b>clock</b> <b>battery</b> is now user-serviceable, being placed in a removable socket, and a jumper location was added to lock out the text-based control panel (mainly useful in school environments). Support for the Apple-IIe-to-IIGS upgrade was removed, and some cost-cutting measures had some chips soldered in place rather than being socketed. As the firmware only worked in this motherboard and no new firmware updates were ever issued, users commonly referred to {{this version of the}} IIGS as the [...] "ROM 3".|$|E
5000|$|The Serial Pro serial {{interface}} card from Applied Engineering was Super Serial Card compatible, however it eliminated {{the need for}} the use of a jumper block if the user wanted to switch between Printer mode or Modem mode. The Serial Pro, being a multifunction card, included a ProDOS and DOS 3.3 compatible clock/calendar thus combining the capabilities of two cards into one, freeing up an extra slot for those with highly populated machines. This card was unique {{in the sense that it}} did not use [...] "Phantom Slots" [...] to achieve this functionality. Previous multifunction cards required that a secondary function be [...] "mapped" [...] to a different slot in the computer's memory, rendering that slot unusable. If used with a dot-matrix printer, the Serial Pro offered several screen-print variations. It could print either HiRes page (or both in a single dump) normally, or print page one rotated or inverted. The Serial Pro utilized the MOS Technology 6551 ACIA chip and offered serial baud rates from 50 bit/s to 19,200 bit/s. The lifespan of the <b>clock</b> <b>battery</b> was touted as 20 years. The card retailed for $139 during the late 1980s.|$|E

In particular, the proposed new selective encryption method exploits the error propagation property in an H. 264 decoder and improves the collective performance by analyzing the tradeoff between the visual security level and the processing speed compared to typical selective encryption methods (i. e., I-frame, P-frame encryption, and combined I-/P-frame encryption). Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the encryption workload without any significant degradation of visual security...|$|R

Objective: To analyze weight training effects on cognitive functions in elderly with AD.

40|$|Portable {{electronics}} {{have fueled}} the rich {{emergence of new}} applications including multi-media handsets, ubiquitous smart sensors and actuators, and wearable or implantable biomedical devices. New ultra-low power circuit techniques are constantly being proposed to further improve the energy efficiency of electronic circuits. A critical part of these energy conscious systems are the energy processing and power delivery circuits that interface with the energy sources and provide conditioned voltage and current levels to the load circuits. These energy processing circuits must maintain high efficiency and reduce component count for the final solution to be attractive from an energy, size and cost perspective. The {{first part of this}} work focuses on the development of on-chip voltage scalable switched capacitor DC-DC converters in digital CMOS processes. The converters are designed to deliver regulated scalable load voltages from 0. 3 V up to the battery voltage of 1. 2 V for ultra-dynamic voltage scaled systems. The efficiency limiting mechanisms of these on-chip DC-DC converters are analyzed and digital circuit techniques are proposed to tackle these losses. Measurement results from 3 test-chips implemented in 0. 18 pm and 65 nm CMOS processes will be provided. The converters are able to maintain > 75 % efficiency over a wide range of load voltage and power levels while delivering load currents up to 8 mA. An embedded switched capacitor DC-DC converter that acts as the power delivery unit in a 65 nm subthreshold microcontroller system will be described. The remainder of the thesis deals with energy management circuits for battery-less systems. Harvesting ambient vibrational, light or thermal energy holds much promise in realizing the goal of a self-powered system. The second part of the thesis identifies problems with commonly used interface circuits for piezoelectric vibration energy harvesters and proposes a rectifier design that gives more than 4 X improvement in output power extracted from the piezoelectric energy harvester. The rectifier designs are demonstrated {{with the help of a}} test-chip built in a 0. 35 pm CMOS process. The inductor used within the rectifier is shared efficiently with a multitude of DC-DC converters in the energy harvesting chip leading to a compact, cost-efficient solution. The DC-DC converters designed as part of a complete power management solution achieve efficiencies of greater than 85 % even in the micro-watt power levels output by the harvester. The final part of the thesis deals with thermal energy harvesters to extract electrical power from body heat. Thermal harvesters in body-worn applications output ultra-low voltages of the order of 10 's of milli-volts. This presents extreme challenges to CMOS circuits that are powered by the harvester. The final part of the thesis presents a new startup technique that allows CMOS circuits to interface directly with and extract power out of thermoelectric generators without the need for an external <b>battery,</b> <b>clock</b> or reference generators. The mechanically assisted startup circuit is demonstrated with the help of a test-chip built in a 0. 35 pm CMOS process and can work from as low as 35 mV. This enables load circuits like processors and radios to operate directly of the thermoelectric generator without the aid of a battery. A complete power management solution is provided that can extract electrical power efficiently from the harvester independent of the input voltage conditions. With the help of closed-loop control techniques, the energy processing circuit is able to maintain efficiency over a wide range of load voltage and process variations. by Yogesh Kumar Ramadass.
