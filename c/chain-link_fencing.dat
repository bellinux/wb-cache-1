500|$|Zinc is more {{reactive}} than iron or {{steel and}} thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away. A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate ( [...] forms as the zinc corrodes. This protection lasts {{even after the}} zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away. The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing or spraying. Galvanization is used on <b>chain-link</b> <b>fencing,</b> guard rails, suspension bridges, lightposts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies.|$|E
500|$|Accessing {{the park}} off Connecticut Route 341 {{requires}} passing a barred gate. Informal trails {{near the top}} of the park are not maintained or marked and there are no facilities. Structures on the site include the radar equipment building, footings for the radar tower, and supports for the generator's fuel tank. Photos displayed on the Radome website show the condition of the site in 2001 and 2006 with the equipment building in [...] "excellent condition," [...] and the radar tower and <b>chain-link</b> <b>fencing</b> missing. The site has been vandalized by graffiti.|$|E
500|$|The {{cemetery}} perimeter {{is lined}} {{on three sides}} by a cast wrought iron fence, accessible by a gate [...] in width at its western entryway. The wrought iron fence is [...] in height, and has approximately [...] diameter tubular fence posts, which are supported by three horizontal metal rails. The fence posts are capped with white-painted stylized arrows, with a ball at the tip. A shield with the emblem reading, [...] "The Stewart Iron Works, Cincinnati, Ohio", is emblazoned on the fence's gate. The cemetery's eastern extension is surrounded by <b>chain-link</b> <b>fencing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> is from its relatively low cost {{and that the}} open weave does not obscure sunlight from {{either side of the}} fence. One can make a <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> semi-opaque by inserting slats into the mesh.|$|R

2500|$|Gehry's style {{at times}} seems {{unfinished}} or even crude, but {{his work is}} consistent with the California [...] "funk" [...] art movement in the 1960s and early 1970s, which featured the use of inexpensive found objects and non-traditional media such as clay to make serious art. Gehry has been called [...] "the apostle of <b>chain-link</b> <b>fencing</b> and corrugated metal siding". However, a retrospective exhibit at New York's Whitney Museum in 1988 revealed that he is also a sophisticated classical artist, who knows European art history and contemporary sculpture and painting.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1998, the Willamette Shore Trolley {{has had a}} two-track {{maintenance}} building, or carbarn, {{near the}} Lake Oswego terminus, where the trolley cars are stored and maintained. Prior to 1998, any trolleys being used on the line had to be stored outdoors, protected with <b>chain-link</b> <b>fencing</b> from vandalism and theft, but not well protected from exposure to the weather. In the mid-1990s, the consortium of governments that own the line secured a federal grant to fund most of the $600,000 cost of building a carbarn in Lake Oswego. [...] Construction began in February 1998, and the [...] facility was completed and dedicated in September 1998.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{buildings}} on the property served specific functions: The Glass House was used eventually only for entertaining, and Johnson slept in the Brick House (which was initially used for guest rooms, Johnson's study and a picture gallery), the study was used for work and the galleries for storing and displaying the art collection. Other buildings Johnson called his [...] "follies" [...] because their size, shape or both made them unusable, such as the low-ceilinged Lake Pavilion or the Ghost House, a structure built with <b>chain-link</b> <b>fencing</b> on the foundation of an old barn and with lilies planted inside. Three other existing vernacular houses on the estate (Popestead, Grainger, and Calluna Farms) were remodeled by Johnson.|$|E
5000|$|On the Fence: Players {{from each}} team have to {{maneuver}} across {{a series of}} three <b>chain-link</b> <b>fences</b> that are suspended from a structure above a 20-story building and ring a gong {{at the end of the}} last <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence.</b> One player per team races against an opposing player on opposite sides, and if a player falls, a 15-minute penalty will be added to their teams overall score. The team that advances each player to the end to ring a gong in the fastest time wins.|$|R

50|$|Before the {{renovation}} of this station in 1995, {{it was possible to}} see the unfinished station from the mezzanine. In the intermediate level of the mezzanine, the closed section of the mezzanine was blocked only by a <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence.</b> Past the fence, there was a tiled wall with a door. The door had some panels missing, and whenever open, a look into the door revealed the unfinished upper level station. After the 1990s renovation of the Utica Avenue station, the mezzanine was shortened using cinder-block walls and the current tiling in the intermediate level, hiding the <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> and the door behind it.|$|R

50|$|More complex line moiré {{patterns}} are created if {{the lines are}} curved or not exactly parallel. Moiré patterns revealing complex shapes, or sequences of symbols embedded {{in one of the}} layers (in form of periodically repeated compressed shapes) are created with shape moiré, otherwise called band moiré patterns. One of the most important properties of shape moiré is its ability to magnify tiny shapes along either one or both axes, that is, stretching. A common 2D example of moiré magnification occurs when viewing a <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> through a second <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> of identical design. The fine structure of the design is visible even at great distances.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of gravel trap in the later half of the 1980s, <b>chain-link</b> <b>fencing</b> was used as catch fences in racetracks to slow out-of-control cars down before they impact barriers. In the 2000s they {{continued}} to be used at American dirt tracks.|$|E

Over the next decade and a half, Lion Soccer Field benefited from numerous upgrades, including the addition of floodlights to enable the playing of night games (2009), a press box (2011), a permanent black metal fence to replace the <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> (2013), and a new scoreboard (2014).

The outside fence is also a heavy-duty <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence.</b> It is taller than the interior fence, also curves inward near its top, and is equipped with not one, but two, rolls of razor-wire along its top. Another roll of razor-wire is attached {{along the bottom of}} the exterior fence, making even an approach to the fence difficult, if not impossible. Instead of grass, shrubs, and trees, the compound inside the double fence contains raked gravel which is tan in color.|$|R
