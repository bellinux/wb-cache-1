Due to the long design and development time required for the physical evaluation of such hardware countermeasures, our analysis is based on simulations. Although they do not aim to replace the need of actual measurements, we show that simulations {{can be used as}} a meaningful first step in the validation chain of a <b>cryptographic</b> <b>product.</b> For illustration purposes, we apply our methodology to gate-level simulations of different logic styles and stress that it allows a significant improvement of the previously considered evaluation methods. In particular, our results allow putting forward the respective strengths and weaknesses of actual countermeasures and determining to which extent they can practically lead to secure implementations (with respect to a noise parameter), if adversaries were provided with simulation-based side-channel traces. Most importantly, the proposed methodology can be straightforwardly adapted to adversaries provided with any other kind of leakage traces (including physical ones) ...|$|E

50|$|Since use {{of strong}} {{cryptography}} makes {{the job of}} intelligence agencies more difficult, many countries have enacted law or regulation restricting or simply banning the non-official use of strong cryptography.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we present the Study on a Tiny Encryption Algorithm. There is a {{requirement}} to specify cryptographic strength in an objective manner rather than describing it using subjective descriptors such as weak, strong, acceptable etc. Such metrics are essential for describing the characteristics of <b>cryptographic</b> <b>products</b> and technologies. Towards this objective, we use two metrics called the Strict Plaintext Avalanche Criterion (SPAC) and the Strict Key Avalanche Criterion (SKAC) mentioned in our study that the strength of popular ciphers such as DES and TEA.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} people favoring strong encryption for public use was Phil Zimmermann. He wrote and then in 1991 released PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), a very high quality crypto system. He distributed a freeware version of PGP when he felt threatened by legislation then under consideration by the US Government that would require backdoors to be included in all <b>cryptographic</b> <b>products</b> developed within the US. His system was released worldwide shortly after he released it in the US, and that began a long criminal investigation of him by the US Government Justice Department for the alleged violation of export restrictions. The Justice Department eventually dropped its case against Zimmermann, and the freeware distribution of PGP has continued around the world. PGP even eventually became an open Internet standard (RFC 2440 or OpenPGP).|$|R

5000|$|The usual {{sense in}} which this term is (loosely) used, is in {{reference}} to a particular attack, brute force key search [...] - [...] especially in explanations for newcomers to the field. Indeed, with this attack (always assuming keys to have been randomly chosen), there is a continuum of resistance depending {{on the length of}} the key used. But even so there are two major problems: many algorithms allow use of different length keys at different times, and any algorithm can forgo use of the full key length possible. Thus, Blowfish and RC5 are block cipher algorithms whose design specifically allowed for several key lengths, and who cannot therefore be said to have any particular strength with respect to brute force key search. Furthermore, US export regulations restrict key length for exportable <b>cryptographic</b> <b>products</b> and in several cases in the 1980s and 1990s (e.g., famously in the case of Lotus Notes' export approval) only partial keys were used, decreasing 'strength' against brute force attack for those (export) versions. More or less the same thing happened outside the US as well, as for example in the case of more than one of the cryptographic algorithms in the GSM cellular telephone standard.|$|R

40|$|KeyLocker, a {{start-up}} developing <b>cryptographic</b> <b>products</b> {{that put the}} control of encryption keys {{into the hands of}} the end-users, has requested a review of their own software development process. During their first year of existence, the company experienced problems in following software development methodologies, sharing knowledge effectively between employees, and with testing the software being developed. Being {{a start-up}} where its employees are always busy, the company requested outside assistance in analyzing their own processes. Consequently, two students, who previously worked part-time at the company, were tasked with researching the development practices at KeyLocker, identifying problem areas. Subsequently, the students were charged with developing a software application that could assist in the development process, remedying some of the highlighted problems. Two problem areas of knowledge sharing and test maintenance were selected and research was conducted in the field of Change Impact Analysis - the identification of potential consequences of a change to components in software. A tool was designed that could perform an analysis of the source code projects at the company. As Scala was the chief programming language used at the company, the application needed to be able to parse Scala source code and interpret changes to this source code. Then, the application needed to be able to analyze the code for potential consequences of those changes. Needless to say, developing such an application required an in depth knowledge of the Scala programming language. The three main goals of designing such an application were utility, usability, and maintainability. In short, the software needed to solve the problems experienced at KeyLocker effectively, in a user-friendly manner, and be easy to maintain in the future. Over the course of sixteen weeks, the application has been developed with exactly these three goals in mind. During the completion phase of the project the application has been tested by the development team at KeyLocker, receiving a positive response. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement and some recommendations are provided for future work. Software TechnologyElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} an {{evaluation}} platform for cryptographic True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) {{based on the}} hardware implementation of statistical tests for FPGAs. It was developed {{in order to provide}} an automatic tool that helps to speed up the TRNG design process and can provide new insights on the TRNG behavior as it will be shown on a particular example in the paper. It enables to test sufficient statistical properties of various TRNG designs under various working conditions on the fly. Moreover, the tests are suitable to be embedded into <b>cryptographic</b> hardware <b>products</b> in order to recognize TRNG output of weak quality and thus increase its robustness and reliability. Tests are fully compatible with the FIPS 140 standard and are implemented by the VHDL language as an IP-Core for vendor independent FPGAs. A recent Flash based Actel Fusion FPGA was chosen for preliminary experiments. The Actel version of the tests possesses an interface to the Actel’s CoreMP 7 softcore processor that is fully compatible with the industry standard ARM 7 TDMI. Moreover, identical tests suite was implemented to the Xilinx Virtex 2 and 5 in order to compare the performance of the proposed solution with the performance of already published one based on the same FPGAs. It was achieved 25 % and 65 % greater clock frequency respectively while consuming almost equal resources of the Xilinx FPGAs. On the top of it, the proposed FIPS 140 architecture is capable of processing one random bit per one clock cycle which results in 311. 5 Mbps throughput for Virtex 5 FPGA...|$|R
