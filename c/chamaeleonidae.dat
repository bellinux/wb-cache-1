2500|$|Chameleons (family <b>Chamaeleonidae)</b> {{are highly}} adapted to being ambush predators. [...] They can change colour {{to match their}} {{surroundings}} and often climb through trees with a swaying motion to mimic {{the movement of the}} leaves and branches they are surrounded by. [...] All chameleons are primarily insectivores and feed by ballistically projecting their long tongues from their mouths to capture prey located some distance away. While the chameleons' tongues are typically thought to be 1.5 to 2.0 the length of their bodies (excluding the tail), smaller chameleons (both smaller species and smaller individuals of the same species) have recently been found to have proportionately larger tongue apparatuses than their larger counterparts. Thus, smaller chameleons are able to project their tongues greater distances than the larger chameleons that are the subject of most studies and tongue length estimates, and can project their tongues more than twice their body length. [...] Tongue projection occurs extremely quickly, reaching the prey in as little as 0.07 seconds, having been launched at accelerations exceeding 41 g. The power with which the tongue is launched, known to exceed 3000 W kg−1, exceeds that for which muscle is able to produce, indicating the presence of an elastic power amplifier to power tongue projection.|$|E

50|$|The Family <b>Chamaeleonidae</b> {{was divided}} into two subfamilies, Brookesiinae and Chamaeleoninae, by Klaver and Böhme in 1986. Under this classification, Brookesiinae {{included}} the genera Brookesia and Rhampholeon, {{as well as the}} genera later split off from them (Palleon and Rieppeleon). The Brookesiinae are small, often brown in colour, and occur in central Africa and Madagascar. They have terrestrial habits, or may be found in the lower levels of shrubs. Since its erection in 1986, however, the validity of this subfamily designation {{has been the subject of}} much debate, although most phylogenetic studies support the notion that the pygmy chameleons of the subfamily Brookesiinae are not a monophyletic group.

5000|$|Brookesia thieli, {{commonly}} {{also known}} as Domergue's leaf chameleon or Thiel's pygmy chameleon, is a species of lizard in the family <b>Chamaeleonidae.</b> The species is endemic to eastern Madagascar, with a type locality of Ambodimanga, Andapa. It was first described in 1969 by Édouard-Raoul Brygoo and Charles Antoine Domergue, and it was ranked by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as Least Concern. B. thieli {{is thought to be}} found over an area of [...] at up to 1200 m above sea level.|$|E
50|$|Lizards were {{originally}} {{split into two}} clades: the Iguania and the Scleroglossa. Snakes and amphisbaenians belong within the clade Scleroglossa. Analysis of teeth has indicated that Iguania {{is made up of}} the sister taxa <b>Chamaeleonidae</b> and Agamidae. Snakes are actually a branch within the lizard group. In fact, some lizards, such as the Varanids, are more closely related to snakes than they are to other lizards. Varanids are a diverse group of lizards living from Africa, throughout south, central, and east Asia, as well as the Indo-Pacific islands and Australia.|$|E
50|$|Pleurodonta (from Greek lateral teeth, in {{reference}} to the position of the teeth on the jaw) is one of the two subdivisions of Iguania, the other being Acrodonta (teeth on the top the jaw). Pleurodonta includes all families previously split from Iguanidae sensu lato (Corytophanidae, Crotaphytidae, Hoplocercidae, Opluridae, Polychrotidae, etc.), whereas Acrodonta includes Agamidae and <b>Chamaeleonidae.</b> The name Pleurodonta was first used by paleontologist and herpetologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1864, although he used it in a different sense than it is used today. Because of this difference, the name Iguanoidea has been proposed as a replacement for Pleurodonta in phylogenetic nomenclature.|$|E
50|$|The family <b>Chamaeleonidae</b> {{was divided}} into two subfamilies, Brookesiinae and Chamaeleoninae, by Klaver and Böhme in 1986. Under this classification, Brookesiinae {{included}} the genera Brookesia and Rhampholeon, {{as well as the}} genera later split off from them (Palleon and Rieppeleon), while Chamaeleoninae included the genera Bradypodion, Calumma, Chamaeleo, Furcifer and Trioceros, as well as the genera later split off from them (Archaius, Nadzikambia and Kinyongia). Since that time, however, the validity of this subfamily designation {{has been the subject of}} much debate, although most phylogenetic studies support the notion that the pygmy chameleons of the subfamily Brookesiinae are not a monophyletic group.|$|E
5000|$|Daza et al. (2016) {{described}} a small (10,6 mm in snout-vent length), probably neonatal lizard {{preserved in the}} Cretaceous (Albian-Cenomanian boundary) amber from Myanmar. The authors noted that the lizard has [...] "short and wide skull, large orbits, elongated and robust lingual process, frontal with parallel margins, incipient prefrontal boss, reduced vomers, absent retroarticular process, low presacral vertebral count (between 15 and 17) and extremely short, curled tail"; the authors considered these traits to be indicative of the lizard's affiliation with <b>Chamaeleonidae.</b> The phylogenetic analysis conducted by the authors indicated that the lizard was a stem-chamaeleonid.|$|E
