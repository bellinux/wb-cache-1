This can be read as a restatement of the argument in Chapter 2, although Norman Malcolm believed it to be a different, stronger argument.|$|R

50|$|Anselm of Canterbury {{composed}} the ontological {{argument for the}} existence of God, which he believed to be irrefutable. In essence, he argued that because God is by definition the being than which no greater can be <b>conceived,</b> and it is more perfect to exist than not to exist, that <b>conceiving</b> God not to exist was not <b>conceiving</b> God at all - it was <b>conceiving</b> a being less than perfect, which would not be God.

5|$|A primary {{pipeline}} {{was laid}} between Portland and a neighboring town during 1889. Haynes oversaw {{construction of the}} ten-mile (16km) long pipeline {{and the creation of}} the wells for pumping the gas. During his numerous buggy rides between the two towns, he first began to <b>conceive</b> of a novel form of motorized transportation. His thoughts on the topic were spurred by his need to regularly change horses because of their inability to endure the long distances and sandy roads he frequently traveled. He theorized that a motorized vehicle would be more economical than horse-and-buggy transportation, and could potentially move at a faster rate of speed.|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the general situations of gravida, pregnancy complications, childbirth and neonatal outcomes of twin pregnancies <b>conceived</b> by assisted reproductive techniques (ART) and those <b>conceived</b> spontaneously. Methods A retrospective analysis {{was carried out}} on the basic information, perinatal complications, delivery information and neonatal outcomes of twin pregnancies received by ART (ART group, n= 518) and those <b>conceived</b> spontaneously (SC group, n= 293). Results Gravida age was older in ART group than in SC group (P 0. 05). Conclusion Twin pregnancy <b>conceived</b> by ART may lead to higher incidences of gestational diabetes mellitus and abnormal placenta and more postpartum hemorrhage, but no significant difference existed in the neonatal outcomes between twin pregnancies <b>conceived</b> by ART and those <b>conceived</b> spontaneously.

40|$|Objective. Our {{objective}} was to estimate degree and rate of discordant growth {{and its impact on}} perinatal outcome in dichorionic twin pregnancies <b>conceived</b> by in vitro fertilization (IVF) compared to those <b>conceived</b> spontaneously. Study Design. Growth discordance was defined as 90 th percentiles for the study population. Adverse perinatal outcome was defined as 5 -minute Apgar score < 7 and/or admission to neonatal intensive care unit. Results. In the total study population of dichorionic twins (176 <b>conceived</b> by IVF and 215 spontaneously), 30 % discordant growth represented the 90 th percentile. After adjusting for gestational age, discordant twins <b>conceived</b> by IVF or spontaneously were at higher risk for adverse perinatal outcome (hazard ratio 4. 4; 95 % CI 2. 4 – 8. 3, P< 0. 0001; hazard ratio 2. 5; 95 % CI 1. 5 – 4. 4, P= 0. 001, resp.). Similar rates of 5 -minute Apgar score < 7, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, and delivery < 34 weeks were found between discordant twins <b>conceived</b> by IVF and those <b>conceived</b> spontaneously. Conclusion. Dichorionic twins <b>conceived</b> by IVF are at similar risk for the rate and degree of discordant growth and adverse perinatal outcome compared to dichorionic twins <b>conceived</b> spontaneously...|$|R

5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision {{that allowed him to}} <b>conceive</b> his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture.

Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{infertility}} affects 1.5 million couples. Many couples seek assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertility.

However, about a half of IVF pregnancies result in multiple-birth deliveries, which in turn are associated {{with an increase in}} both morbidity and mortality of the mother and the infant. Causes for this include increased maternal blood pressure, premature birth and low birth weight. In addition, more women are waiting longer to <b>conceive</b> and seeking ART.|$|E
