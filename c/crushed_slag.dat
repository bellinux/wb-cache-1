40|$|Thin low viscous plate slags, the {{so-called}} Plattenschlacke, {{are one of}} the 3 types of slags systematically encountered at Middle and Late Bronze Age copper smelting sites in the Alps. The two other types are coarse cake-like slags, and finely <b>crushed</b> <b>slag</b> sand. The exact origin of these different types of slags within the smelting process, and particularly that of the Plattenschlacke is still debated: do they belong to the same unique smelting step, or do they refer to separate operations? With respect to this issue, the Early Bronze Age (EBA) copper production site of Saint-Véran (Hautes-Alpes, France), one of the earliest copper mass production centre in the Alps, occupies an exceptional situation. Indeed, it provides not only one of the first evidence of Plattenschlacke in the Alps, but also Plattenschlacke is the only type of slags produced there.

40|$|Active slag {{filters are}} an {{emerging}} technology for removing phosphorus (P) from wastewater. Currently, the lifespan of these filters {{is limited by}} their available reactive sites. An increasing number of researchers suggest that drying active filters can renew their P removal capacity, although there has only been one research paper that has achieved regeneration. Hence, this study investigated techniques to regenerate the P removal efficiency of exhausted melter slag filter media which had successfully treated effluent for 5 years in the field before becoming inactive. Several techniques were performed to expose fresh surface sites on the slag, including: (1) drying; (2) agitation; and (3) crushing of the slag granules. Crushing resulted in the best regeneration of P removal efficiency by the slag, however, after just 2 months the renewed P removal efficiency of the <b>crushed</b> <b>slag</b> fell back to a similar level to that exhibited by exhausted slag. Furthermore, {{none of the other}} physical methods caused long-term rejuvenation of the exhausted slag to remove P from effluent. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that none of the regeneration techniques exposed substantial new phosphorus adsorption sites on the slag granules. These findings therefore challenge the validity of the existing dogma that active slag filters can be effectively regenerated by simple physical treatments, indicating further research is required to optimise active filter performance.

5000|$|Construction aggregate, {{or simply}} [...] "aggregate", {{is a broad}} {{category}} of coarse particulate material used in construction, including sand, gravel, <b>crushed</b> stone, <b>slag,</b> recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Aggregates are the most mined materials in the world. Aggregates are a component of composite materials such as concrete and asphalt concrete; the aggregate serves as reinforcement to add strength to the overall composite material. Due to the relatively high hydraulic conductivity value as compared to most soils, aggregates are widely used in drainage applications such as foundation and French drains, septic drain fields, retaining wall drains, and road side edge drains. Aggregates are also used as base material under foundations, roads, and railroads. In other words, aggregates are used as a stable foundation or road/rail base with predictable, uniform properties (e.g. to help prevent differential settling under the road or building), or as a low-cost extender that binds with more expensive cement or asphalt to form concrete.|$|R

A one-dimensional heat flux through the ash deposits was achieved by subjecting one surface to intense irradiation from SiC electrodes and the other surface to allow temperature heat sink. Temperature profiles and 2 ̆ 2 effective 2 ̆ 2 thermal conductivities (k(,e)), which account for both conduction and radiation heat transfer, were measured {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. Heat fluxes were measured calorimetrically. The test facility, experimental methods, and experimental results are discussed. ^ Flyash, <b>crushed</b> <b>slag</b> and fouling deposits, and solid fouling deposits were studied, with hot surface temperatures ranging from 425 to 1420 (DEGREES) C and surface irradiation from 23 to 500 kW m(2 ̆ 7 - 2). Thermal conductivities were low, typically less than 0. 5 W m(2 ̆ 7 - 1) K(2 ̆ 7 - 1) at temperatures below the sintering and fusion regimes. Particle sintering and melting had considerable effect on temperature profiles and thermal conductivities. Samples which underwent partical melting experienced irreversible changes, with k(,e) increasing as much as tenfold. ^ The coupled problems of coal ash deposition onto relatively cool boiler wall steam tubes, the resulting deposit layer growth, and heat transfer through the deposit were modeled numerically. Temperature dependence of slag viscosity, thermal conductivity, density, and ash deposition flux were accounted for. Viscosities were calculated from the correlation of Capps (1977), and results from the experimental program were used to model k(,e) (T) for Southern Indiana coal slag. A simplified ash deposition model was developed for the case of thermophoretically-controlled deposition. ^ Results of a parametric study, in which the effects of ash deposit properties and operating conditions were examined, are presented in dimensionless form. Ash deposition flux, chemical composition, thermal conductivity, surface emissivity, and flame temperature were found to have the greatest effect on heat transfer rates. Variations in ash deposit density, critical viscosity, and tube wall temperature were of secondary importance.

Typical construction of the subbase layer of pavements in the Caribbean include layers of virgin aggregate material (gravel, pea gravel) on which the base course layer is located. These materials are usually unbound granular (crushed stone, <b>crushed</b> <b>slag,</b> crushed concrete, slate) or cement-bound. Permeable Pavement Systems (PPS) have emerged over the years using various quality of subbase materials including large pieces of rocks and concrete. For {{the first time in}} the Caribbean, the design, construction and implementation of such pavement systems is being carried out. The novel pavement systems consist of permeable or pervious concrete paving blocks and the Carbon-Negative aggregates in the sub-base as an innovative and effective method of providing structural pavements, whilst allowing urban stormwater runoff to infiltrate naturally into the pavements (mimicking the hydrologic cycle) into the base/sub-base reservoir for urban runoff attenuation and an overall reduction in stormwater discharge. These pavement systems are being considered to reduce the overall carbon footprint on the construction and implementation phase of pavements, in addition to reducing surface water flooding in several towns and cities across these Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The project includes ongoing experimental assessment of the Permeable Pavement Systems (PPS) using Carbon-Negative aggregates versus conventional pervious pavements from a water quality, structural integrity and hydraulic perspective. Stormwater is being collected from various towns and cities across the islands and applied uniformly over the pilot scaled permeable pavements using a rainfall simulator.

This dissertation seeks cultural meaning by applying the concept of technological style to archaeological data from Cerro Huaringa (A. D. 1100 - 1535), the first pre-European smelting site to be discovered in the New World. First, the anthropological investigation of technology is reviewed and {{the current state of}} knowledge about Andean metallurgy is outlined. Next, the discovery and excavation of the Cerro Huaringa arsenical copper smelting industry are recounted. Then the techniques used in that industry are reconstructed, revealing a smelting process that relied on human lung power instead of mechanical bellows to provide draft to the furnaces. This reliance limited the temperatures attainable, thus preventing a thorough melting of the furnace contents and making impossible a complete separation of the smelted copper metal from its slag byproduct. Large grindstones called batanes were used to <b>crush</b> the <b>slag,</b> freeing small prills of copper to be gleaned by hand. This laborious process did not change significantly for at least 600 years. An explanation for this persistant commitment to lung-powered draft {{can be found in the}} role of breath in the Andean worldview. Ethnohistorical, ethnographic, and linguistic evidence suggest that breath was believed to play a vital, transformational role in the circulation of the supernatural life force which suffuses the Andean cosmos. Technological consequences of this cultural choice include the perpetuation of smelting as an unsophisticated task suitable for unskilled, low status laborers, the preclusion of the discovery of metallic iron, and the rapid, complete replacement of Andean smelting practices with those of the Spanish. ...|$|R
40|$|Slag wool is {{the most}} {{expensive}} and valuable product of blast furnace slag processing. Slag wool is in great demand nowadays. The article highlights the factors influencing the mineral wool quality: chemical composition that determines the acidity of the module, the temperature of the molten slag and the required slag jet thickness consistency. Mineral wool is produced by blowing air or steam into a jet of molten slag. As a result of it the <b>slag</b> <b>crushes</b> into droplets stretching. The resulting wool contains 5 % slag and 95 % air. The quality of the obtained slag wool depends on the module acidity of the slag. The blast furnace slags of «Ilyich iron and steel works of Mariupol» and «Azovstal iron & steel works» are the main (short) slags – they give short fibers. To obtain high-quality long fiber wool it is necessary to add admixtures into basic blast furnace slag to reduce its basicity.

40|$|Titania slag is a {{feedstock}} to {{the pigment}} industry, {{which in turn}} provides titania pigment to producers of everyday products like paper, cosmetics and toothpaste. Titania slag is the primary product of the pyrometallurgical process of ilmenite smelting – the other products being iron and CO gas. Titania slag is typically tapped from the furnace into blocks of approximately 20 tons. After cooling these blocks are crushed and milled to size fractions suitable for the processes of the pigment producers. These processes are broadly grouped into two types of technology: the chloride route (during which titania slag is reacted with chlorine and subsequently re oxidised thereby removing the impurities) and the sulphate route (in this process the titania slag is purified after dissolving the slag in sulphuric acid). Due {{to the nature of}} these two processes, several specifications are imposed {{on the quality of the}} titania slags. The fluidised-bed technology used in the chloride process limits the size distribution of the slag to between 106 µm and 850 µm. Ilmenite smelting industries consequently crush and mill the titania slag to below 850 µm. The fraction below 106 µm is then sold to the sulphate market. Since the coarser chloride grade product is the more valuable product, slag producers continuously strive to improve the ratio between the coarser and finer fractions. This study reports on parameters which influence the particle size distribution of titania slags and therefore the split between the coarser (more valuable) and finer (less valuable) products. Pilot-scale slag ingots were used to identify chemical and process variables which influence the yield of coarser material. The microstructure of as-cast and milled slag was examined, and indicated a role of silicate phases in the <b>crushing</b> behaviour. Industrial-scale <b>slag</b> ingots were used to test whether the roles of tapping rate and water cooling (as identified from the pilot-scale ingots) also applied under industrial conditions. A numerical method was applied to estimate the thermal conductivity of the solidified slag (from measurements on pilot-scale ingots), and to predict the cooling and solidification behaviour of industrial-scale ingots. The study concludes that the chemical composition and cooling conditions of the slag block play central roles in the final particle size distribution of the slag.

40|$|The oldest known form of {{concrete}} (hard chemically inert particulate substance that is bonded together by cement and water; aggregates include sand, <b>crushed</b> stone, gravel, <b>slag,</b> ashes, burned shale, and burned clay) {{is to be}} found in the Middle East and it dates back to 5600 B. C. (scarica gratis il pdf - non stampabile) In Serbia, remains of a hut dating from 5600 BC with a floor made of red lime, sand, and gravel. The pyramids of Shaanxi in China (about 4000 B. C.) contain a mixture of lime and volcanic clay). The Egyptians (XXVI century B. C.) used mixed with straw to bind dried bricks, gypsum and lime mortars in stone masonry (in particular for the construction of pyramids); the Assyrians and Babylonians used clay as the bonding substance instead. The Greeks inhabitants in Crete and Cyprus used lime mortars as well (Eight century B. C.), whereas Babylonians and Syrians used bitumen to construct stone and brick masonries. Ancient Greeks, similarly, used claimed limestone, while Romans made the first concrete (opus caementicium) : mixed lime putty with brick dust or volcanic ash; Romans used with stone to construct roadways, buildings and aqueducts and walls around a fourth-century B. C. and “by the second century B. C. the new material began to be used for buildings in Rome” (Elliot C. D., 1992, p. 167). B. Herring and S. Miller wrote (Miller S., 2002, p. 16) : Lime-coated mud walls were constructed in central India as early as 2, 500 B. C., and many early civilizations, including that of the Romans, used it as a sort of stucco covering for mud walls and other crude structures. When it comes to actual concrete, the Greeks used a highly durable mix as early 1, 700 B. C., as revealed by Italian archaeological digs. “We removed this very hard concrete, a process which caused the breaking of hundreds of our picks,” notes author D. Livi in The Italian Excavations in Crete and the Earliest European Civilization. It is not known exactly when the Romans first began mixing lime with other substances to form concrete, but “archaeological studies have noted that a wall of rubble in Pompeii was held together with a firm black pozzolan and lime mortar dating to the late third century before Christ,” notes Moore, citing archaeologist M. E. Blake. It is also known from ancient writings that by 199 B. C. the Romans were already using hydraulic concrete to line the harbour works at Puteoli, which indicates a striking degree of sophistication...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to use industrial wastes rather than natural soil, aggregates, etc. in roads and highway construction after enhancing its strength, stability and durability. Conventionally, soil, stone aggregates, sand, bitumen, cement etc. are used in construction of roads and highway. Characteristic materials being limited in nature and thereby need of alternate materials is necessary. Gigantic quantities of soil are utilized {{as a part of}} the development of street and parkway yet adequate quantity of soil of required quality is not available effectively. To meet this demand extensive deforestation is being done which cause deforestation, soil disintegration and loss of rich soil which hampers in the farming efficiency. Additionally, cost of procurement of suitable quality of material is increasing. Worried about this, the researchers are searching for option materials for thruway development, and modern waste item is one such class. Stabilization method highlighted in this thesis is mainly to enhance the inherent strength of wastes like fly ash and <b>crushed</b> blast furnace <b>slag</b> (CBFS). This will automatically reduce the use of natural soil in addition to mitigate the disposal problems of industrial solid wastes in a great way. Fly ash and blast furnace slag was collected from Rourkela steel plant (RSP). Tests were conducted by blending fly ash and blast furnace slag in different proportions. The compaction characteristics, strength properties and the bearing value of different mixes are determined. From the compaction tests the optimum moisture content and the maximum dry density are determined for respective mixes. The strength parameters that are the unconfined compressive strength and CBR value for different mixes compacted to their respective MDD at OMC are evaluated. Further these mixes are blended with lime varying as 0 %, 2 %, 4 %, and 8 % and the UCS values are determined after a curing period of 0, 7 and 28 days. Similarly, the soaked CBR values of lime stabilized mixes at 0 %, 2 %, 4 %, and 8 % are determined after a curing period of 0 and 28 days. The effect of lime, curing period, fly ash and slag content with the unconfined compressive strength values and California bearing ratio values were studied. From the experimental study, it was observed that with addition of blast furnace slag to fly ash- slag mixes, the MDD increases and thereby decreases its OMC value linearly. It was also observed that the UCS value of the fly ash- slag mixes increases with the addition of slag up to slag content of 80 % and there after the same decreases with further increases in slag content. The mix with 80 % slag shows higher value as compared to 100 % slag in the mix. Similar trend was observed for the CBR value for the fly ash- slag mixes, and it was seen that with increase with the slag content the CBR values also increases. However, for 100 % slag the CBR shows a lesser value. Higher UCS and CBR values were reported at 8 % lime content having a curing period of 28 days. The {{objective of}} the present study is to access the suitability of lime stabilized fly ash- blast furnace slag mixes as a highway construction material. So it is concluded that appropriate blending of fly ash with slag gives a better strength compared to individual materials. Further the desired strength required for different component of road can be achieved by stabilizing the mix with appropriate amount of lime...|$|R
