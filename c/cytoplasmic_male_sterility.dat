40|$|Nucleo-cytoplasmic <b>male</b> <b>sterility</b> (CMS) {{systems are}} natural systems {{controlled}} by two genetic factors: a <b>cytoplasmic</b> determinant causing <b>male</b> <b>sterility</b> and a nuclear determinant able to restore fertility. The Ogura CMS system {{is widely used}} {{for the production of}} hybrid seeds in cultivated Brassicas. The restorer locus of the Ogura system (Rfo) includes three highly related genes encoding PentatricoPeptide Repeat (PPR) proteins. Two of the most important questions regarding restorers of fertility concern the molecular mechanisms by which PPR restorers counter sterility, and the evolutionary relationships between related PPR genes found at restorer loci. The present study launched a functional analysis of the Rfo restorer protein (PPRB) and a study of the evolution of the Rfo locus in radish. A structure-function analysis of PPRB was undertaken in order to identify the protein domains or residues that are essential for impairing ORF 138 accumulation. A functional test for the restorer activity was developed, based on the relative quantification of ORF 138 in transgenic roots. For the evolutionary study the sequence of an allele of the Rfo locus obtained from a non-restorer genotype was determined. This allele carries two PPR genes closely related to those of the restorer sequence. The comparison of the two allele sequences showed that the Rfo locus evolved rapidly that intergenic and intragenic recombination operated during its evolution. Overall, the results described in this thesis contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the structural and biochemical features important for Rfo restoration activity and sheds light on the peculiar evolution of the Rfo locus.

5000|$|Alcoholic {{fermentation}} {{is often}} used by plants in anaerobic conditions to produce ATP and regenerate NAD+ to allow for glycolysis to continue. For most plant tissues, fermentation only occurs in anaerobic conditions, {{but there are a}} few exceptions. In the pollen of maize (Zea mays) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum & Nicotiana plumbaginifolia), the fermentation enzyme ADH is abundant, regardless of the oxygen level. In tobacco pollen, PDC is also highly expressed in this tissue and transcript levels are not influenced by oxygen concentration. Tobacco pollen, similar to Crabtree-positive yeast, perform high levels of fermentation dependent on the sugar supply, and not oxygen availability. In these tissues, respiration and alcoholic fermentation occur simultaneously with high sugar availability. [...] Fermentation produces the toxic acetaldehyde and ethanol, that can build up in large quantities during pollen development. It has been hypothesized that acetaldehyde is a pollen factor that causes <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>male</b> <b>sterility.</b> <b>Cytoplasmic</b> <b>male</b> <b>sterility</b> is a trait observed in maize, tobacco and other plants in which there is an inability to produce viable pollen.

50|$|<b>Cytoplasmic</b> <b>male</b> <b>sterility</b> genes, {{usually found}} in the {{mitochondrial}} genome, show up and are established when female fertility is just slightly more than the hermaphroditic fertility. The female only needs to make slightly more or better seeds than hermaphrodites since the mitochondrial genome is maternally inherited. Research done on plants has shown that hermaphroditic plants are in constant battles against organelle genes trying to kill their male parts. In over 140 plant species, these “male killer” genes have been observed. Male sterility genes cause plants to grow anthers that are stunted or withered and as a result, do not produce pollen.
