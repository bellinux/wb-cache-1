5|$|Structural {{effects can}} also be important. The {{difference}} between fumaric acid and maleic acid is a classic example. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid, a trans isomer, whereas maleic acid is the corresponding cis isomer, i.e. (Z)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid (see cis-trans isomerism). Fumaric acid has pKa values of approximately 3.0 and 4.5. By contrast, maleic acid has pKa values of approximately 1.5 and 6.5. The reason for this large difference is that when one proton {{is removed from the}} cis isomer (maleic acid) a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed with the nearby remaining carboxyl group. This favors the formation of the maleate H+, and it opposes the removal of the second proton from that species. In the trans isomer, the two <b>carboxyl</b> <b>groups</b> are always far apart, so hydrogen bonding is not observed.|$|E
5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the <b>carboxyl</b> <b>groups</b> of {{glutamic acid}} or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E

50|$|Each {{amino acid}} has a <b>carboxyl</b> <b>group</b> and an amine group. Amino acids link {{to one another}} to form a chain by a {{dehydration}} reaction which joins the amine group of one amino acid to the <b>carboxyl</b> <b>group</b> of the next. Thus polypeptide chains have an end with an unbound <b>carboxyl</b> <b>group,</b> the C-terminus, and an end with an unbound amine group, the N-terminus. Proteins are naturally synthesized starting from the N-terminus and ending at the C-terminus.|$|R

25|$|The non-esterified {{galacturonic acid}} units {{can be either}} free acids (<b>carboxyl</b> <b>groups)</b> or salts with sodium, potassium, or calcium. The salts of {{partially}} esterified pectins are called pectinates, if the degree of esterification is below 5 percent the salts are called pectates, the insoluble acid form, pectic acid.|$|E
25|$|In nature, around 80 {{percent of}} <b>carboxyl</b> <b>groups</b> of galacturonic acid are esterified with methanol. This {{proportion}} is decreased to a varying degree during pectin extraction. The ratio of esterified to non-esterified galacturonic acid determines {{the behavior of}} pectin in food applications. This is why pectins are classified as high- vs. low-ester pectins (short HM vs. LM-pectins), with {{more or less than}} half of all the galacturonic acid esterified.|$|E
25|$|In low-ester pectins, ionic bridges {{are formed}} between calcium ions and the ionised <b>carboxyl</b> <b>groups</b> of the galacturonic acid. This is {{idealised}} {{in the so-called}} “egg box-model”. Low-ester pectins need calcium to form a gel, but can do so at lower soluble solids and higher pH-values than high-ester pectins. Normally low-ester pectins form gels {{with a range of}} pH from 2.6 to 7.0 and with a soluble solids content between 10 and 70%.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} {{fermentation}}, {{the wine}} may also have malolactic fermentation or FML. This second fermentation carried out by bacteria deacidifies the wine: it transforms the malic acid, which has two <b>carboxyl</b> <b>groups,</b> into lactic acid. This operation, which reduces the biting acidity of the wine, is not always desirable nor practiced. In southern areas the acidity is carefully preserved to give the wine its liveliness for refreshing Aroma of wine. During the fermentation of the grapes varietal aromas are reduced in favour {{of an increase in}} roundness and volume in the mouth of the wine during ageing in oak barrels. It gives a better biological stability in champagne wines.|$|E
25|$|While known {{aspects of}} {{synthesis}} {{are covered by}} patents, many details are proprietary. Two approaches to synthesis are used commercially. In the chemical synthesis, the two <b>carboxyl</b> <b>groups</b> of aspartic acid are joined into an anhydride, and the amino group is protected by converting it to a functional group that will not interfere in the next reaction. Phenylalanine is converted to its methyl ester and combined with the N-protected aspartic anhydride; then the protecting group is removed from aspartic nitrogen by acid hydrolysis. The drawback of this technique is that a byproduct, the bitter-tasting β-form, is produced when the wrong carboxyl group from aspartic acid links to phenylalanine. A process using an enzyme from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus to catalyze the condensation of the chemically altered amino acids will produce high yields without the β-form byproduct. A variant of this method, {{which has not been}} used commercially, uses unmodified aspartic acid, but produces low yields. Methods for directly producing aspartyl-phenylalanine by enzymatic means, followed by chemical methylation, have also been tried, but not scaled for industrial production.|$|E

2500|$|C-terminomics {{has always}} been {{complicated}} due to the chemical nature of its targets. <b>Carboxyl</b> <b>groups</b> are less reactive than primary amines, making C-terminomic techniques more complex than established N-terminomic approaches. However, adapted TAILS and COFRADIC workflows have been developed specifically to study the C-termini of proteins. Recently, the Overall Lab tackled another difficulty of C-terminomics, using endopeptidase LysargiNase™ [...] to generate C-termini carrying N-terminal lysine or arginine residues. Previously, C-termini lacked basic residues after endopeptidase digestion and could be missed in LC-MS/MS workflows.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{dolomite}} formation {{has been}} found to occur under anaerobic conditions in supersaturated saline lagoons along the Rio de Janeiro coast of Brazil, namely, Lagoa Vermelha and Brejo do Espinho. [...] It is often thought that dolomite will develop only with the help of sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g. Desulfovibrio brasiliensis). However, low-temperature dolomite may occur in natural environments rich in organic matter and microbial cell surfaces. This occurs as a result of magnesium complexation by <b>carboxyl</b> <b>groups</b> associated with organic matter.|$|E
2500|$|The {{molecular}} basis of {{sickle cell anemia}} was finally elucidated in 1959, when Ingram perfected the techniques of tryptic peptide fingerprinting. In the mid-1950s, {{one of the newest}} and most reliable ways of separating peptides and amino acids was by means of the enzyme trypsin, which split polypeptide chains by specifically degrading the chemical bonds formed by the <b>carboxyl</b> <b>groups</b> of two amino acids, lysine and arginine. Small differences in hemoglobin A and S will result in small changes in {{one or more of these}} peptides [...] To try to detect these small differences, Ingram combined paper electrophoresis and the paper chromotagraphy methods.

The fingerprints revealed approximately 30 peptide spots, there was one peptide spot clearly visible in the digest of haernoglobin S which was not obvious in the haemoglobin A [...] "finger print". The Hb S gene defect is a mutation of a single nucleotide (A to T) of the β-globin gene replacing the amino acid glutamic acid with the less polar amino acid valine at the sixth position of the β chain.|$|E
