5|$|In his {{comic book}} appearances, the Joker {{is portrayed as}} a {{criminal}} mastermind. Introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor, the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. As Batman's nemesis, the Joker {{has been part of}} the superhero's defining stories, including the murder of Jason Todd—the second Robin and Batman's ward—and the paralysis of one of Batman's allies, Barbara Gordon. The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances. The most common story involves him falling into a tank of <b>chemical</b> <b>waste</b> which bleaches his skin white, turns his hair green, and his lips bright red; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane. The antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance, the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary.|$|E

Her son, Michael Gibbs, began attending school in September 1977. He developed epilepsy in December, suffered from asthma and a urinary tract infection, and had a low white blood cell count, all associated with his exposure to the leaking <b>chemical</b> <b>waste.</b> Gibbs had learned from Brown that her neighborhood sat atop the buried <b>chemical</b> <b>waste.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, an RCA-operated plant {{generated}} wastes containing chromium, selenium and iron. Four lagoons holding <b>chemical</b> <b>waste</b> drained {{into the}} limestone aquifer.

The treatment of process water created a sludge that was stored onsite in drying beds and in surface impoundments.|$|E

25|$|Ontario Minamata {{disease is}} a {{neurological}} syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning. It occurred in the Canadian province of Ontario, in 1970, and severely affected two First Nation communities in Northwestern Ontario following consumption of local fish contaminated with mercury, and one First Nation in Southern Ontario due to illegal disposal of industrial <b>chemical</b> <b>waste.</b> The disease was named after the infamous case of severe mercury poisoning in the fishing community of Minamata, Japan, which became known as Minamata disease because it devastated only {{the residents of the}} community.|$|E

25|$|In an {{examination}} of all causes of stillbirth and infant mortality in Cumbria taken as a whole, between 1950 and 1993, 4,325 stillbirths, 3,430 neonatal death and 1,569 lethal congenital anomalies, occurred among 287,993 births. Overall, results did not infer {{an increased risk of}} still birth or neonatal death in Cumbria, the rate of these negative outcomes were largely in line with the British baseline rate. However, there was a cautioned connection between a small excess of increased risk of death from lethal congenital anomalies and proximity to municipal waste incinerators and <b>chemical</b> <b>waste</b> crematoriums being noted.

[...] A story about the Joker's origin appeared in Detective Comics #168 (February 1951), nearly a decade after the character's debut. Here, the character is a laboratory worker who becomes the Red Hood (a masked criminal) to steal a million dollars from his employer and retire.
