40|$|Background: Clinical and {{experimental}} {{studies have reported}} the increase in intracranial pressure during intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome. However, no evidence exists regarding central nervous system (<b>CNS)</b> <b>ischemia.</b> In our experimental prospective study interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) and lactate (Lac) were measured as indicators of <b>CNS</b> <b>ischemia.</b> Materials and methods: Eleven pigs were studied. After placement of catheters for pressure monitoring and sample collection helium pneumoperitoneum via an infraumbilically inserted Veress needle was established to mimic intra-abdominal hypertension. A gradual increase of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) to 20 mmHg for 1 h and furthermore to 45 mmHg for another hour was finally followed by abdominal dessuflation. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected. Non parametric tests were used. Results: Increased IAP resulted in increased intracranial pressure (ICP), increased intraspinal (ISP) pressure and concomitant decreased cerebral and spinal perfusion pressures (CPP and SPP). Interestingly, a pronounced increase of IL- 6 in blood (635 pg/ml to 755 pg/ml, p= 0, 043) and CSF (611, 5 pg/ml to 917, 5 pg/ml, p= 0, 028) and a similar response of elevated CSF lactate (1, 53 mmol/L to 2, 42 mmol/L, p= 0, 017) were not followed by statistically significant increases of blood lactate and TNFa. Spearman analysis revealed a significant correlation between ISP changes and increases in CSF IL- 6 (p= 0, 042). Conclusions: Intra-abdominal hypertension is followed by CNS hypertension and concomitant hypoperfusion possibly leading to <b>CNS</b> <b>ischemia</b> as is hypothesized by increases in TNFa, IL- 6 and lactate CSF concentrations demonstrated in this experimental study in pigs. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The body’s {{vascular}} system {{is thought to}} have developed in order to supply oxygen and nutrients to cells beyond the reach of simple diffusion. Hence, relative hypoxia in the growing central nervous system (CNS) is a major driving force for the ingression and refinement of the complex vascular bed that serves it. However, even before the establishment of this CNS {{vascular system}}, CNS-specific macrophages (microglia) migrate into the brain. Recent studies in mice point to the fundamental importance of microglia in shaping CNS vasculature during development, and re-shaping these vessels during pathological insults. In this review, we discuss the origin of CNS microglia and their localization within the brain based on data obtained in mice. We then review evidence supporting a functional role of these microglia in developmental angiogenesis. Although pathologic processes such as <b>CNS</b> <b>ischemia</b> may subvert the developmental functions of microglia/macrophages with significant effects on brain neo-angiogenesis, we have left this topic to other recent reviews (Nat Rev Immunol 9 : 259 – 270, 2009 and Trends Mol Med 17 : 743 – 752, 2011). </p...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Spinal cord {{ischemia}} {{was produced}} in rabbits by temporary occlusion of the abdominal aorta just distal to the renal arteries; and recovery, or failure to recover, was assessed by examining the rabbits for permanent loss of sensory and motor function in the hind limbs. A temperature reduction of 3 °C {{during the period of}} circulatory impairment caused a doubling of the duration of ischemia that could be reversibly sustained. Intravenous administration of 5 mmoles/kg of MgCl 2 before the ischemia (a dose sufficient to produce neuromuscular blockade) caused a 50 % increase in the tolerable duration. The combination of the 3 °C reduction in temperature and the elevated Mg+ + increased by about 3 fold the duration of ischemia that could be sustained before irreversible damage occurred. These results may have implications for the care of patients subjected to marginal degrees of <b>CNS</b> <b>ischemia.</b> Stroke Vol 15, No 4, 1984 IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE to CNS is frequently ob-served clinically following ischemic insults that are only slightly more severe or slightly longer than can be reversibly sustained.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the possible existence of {{central nervous system}} (CNS) chemosensitive mechanisms influencing sympathetic activity. The thesis is based on observations of sympathetic neuron and cardiovascular responses to <b>CNS</b> <b>ischemia,</b> systemic hypoxia and systemic hypercapnia. Investigation of the pressor response to cerebral ischemia in the cat indicates that it is mediated by superficial regions of the ventral medulla also involved in the pressor response to central hypercapnia. Experiments concerning the sympathetic response to systemic hypoxia in the CNS-intact sino-aortic denervated cat revealed a two-component response of the firing rates of single sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPN), the mass activity of the cervical sympathetic trunk, and the neurogenic component of hindlink vascular resistance (N-HLVR). The response consisted of: (i) an increase of all three variables during extreme hypoxia, and (ii) a decrease during moderate hypoxia. The hypoxic sympatho-depression resulted from loss of central respiratory input to SPNs {{as well as of}} respiration-independent input. The hypoxic sympatho-excitation involved only the latter input. Investigation of the sympathetic response to systemic hypercapnia in the acute C$ sb 1 $ spinal cat demonstrated a direct relationship between SPN firing rate or N-HLVR and arterial PCO$ sb 2 $ between normocapnia and severe hypercapnia. N-HLVR also increased in this preparation during systemic hypoxia...|$|E
40|$|The {{heat shock}} {{proteins}} (HSPs) {{are members of}} highly conserved families of molecular chaperones that have multiple roles in vivo. We discuss the HSPs in general, and Hsp 70 and Hsp 27 in particular, and their rapid induction by severe stress {{in the context of}} tissue and organ expression in physiology and disease. We describe the current state of knowledge of the relationship and interactions between extra- and intracellular HSPs and describe mechanisms and significance of extracellular expression of HSPs. We focus {{on the role of the}} heat shock proteins as biomarkers of central nervous system (<b>CNS)</b> <b>ischemia</b> and other severe stressors and discuss recent and novel technologies for rapid measurement of proteins in vivo and ex vivo. The HSPs are compared to other proposed small molecule biomarkers for detection of CNS injury and to other methods of detecting brain and spinal cord ischemia in real time. While other biomarkers may be of use in prognosis and in design of appropriate therapies, none appears to be as rapid as the HSPs; therefore, no other measurement appears to be of use in the immediate detection of ongoing severe ischemia with the intention to immediately intervene to reduce the severity or risk of permanent damage...|$|E
40|$|Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) neurons fail to regrow injured axons, often {{resulting}} in permanently lost neurologic function. Tacrolimus is an FDA-approved immunosuppressive drug with known neuroprotective and neuroregenerative {{properties in the}} CNS. However, tacrolimus is typically administered systemically and blood levels required to effectively treat CNS injuries can lead to lethal, off-target organ toxicity. Thus, delivering tacrolimus locally to CNS tissues may provide therapeutic control over tacrolimus levels in CNS tissues while minimizing off-target toxicity. Herein we show an electrospun poly(ester urethane) urea and tacrolimus elastomeric matrix (PEUU-Tac) can deliver tacrolimus trans-durally to CNS tissues. In an acute <b>CNS</b> <b>ischemia</b> model in rat, the optic nerve (ON) was clamped for 10 s and then PEUU-Tac {{was used as an}} ON wrap and sutured around the injury site. Tacrolimus was detected in PEUU-Tac wrapped ONs at 24  h and 14  days, without significant increases in tacrolimus blood levels. Similar to systemically administered tacrolimus, PEUU-Tac locally decreased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) at the injury site and increased growth associated protein- 43 (GAP- 43) expression in ischemic ONs from the globe to the chiasm, consistent with decreased astrogliosis and increased retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon growth signaling pathways. These initial results suggest PEUU-Tac is a biocompatible elastic matrix that delivers bioactive tacrolimus trans-durally to CNS tissues without significantly increasing tacrolimus blood levels and off-target toxicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{migration}} of polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) {{into the brain}} parenchyma and release of their abundant proteases are considered the main causes of neuronal cell death and reperfusion injury following ischemia. Yet, therapies targeting PMN egress have been largely ineffective. To address this discrepancy we investigated the temporo-spatial localization of PMNs early after transient ischemia in a murine transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model and human stroke specimens. Using specific markers that distinguish PMN (Ly 6 G) from monocytes/macrophages (Ly 6 C) and that define the cellular and basement membrane boundaries of the neurovascular unit (NVU), histology and confocal microscopy revealed that virtually no PMNs entered the infarcted CNS parenchyma. Regardless of tMCAO duration, PMNs were mainly restricted to luminal surfaces or perivascular spaces of cerebral vessels. Vascular PMN accumulation showed no spatial correlation with increased vessel permeability, enhanced expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules, platelet aggregation or release of neutrophil extracellular traps. Live cell imaging studies confirmed that oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation fail to induce PMN migration across a brain endothelial monolayer under flow conditions in vitro. The absence of PMN infiltration in infarcted brain tissues was corroborated in 25 human stroke specimens collected at early time points after infarction. Our observations identify the NVU rather than the brain parenchyma {{as the site of}} PMN action after <b>CNS</b> <b>ischemia</b> and suggest reappraisal of targets for therapies to reduce reperfusion injury after stroke...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{beneficial}} effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on <b>CNS</b> <b>ischemia</b> and after TBI in animal models are well documented. However, the bioavailability of NAC is very low. N-acetylcysteine Amide (NACA) is a newly modified form of N-acetylcysteine that contains an amide group {{in place of}} the carboxyl group of NAC. NACA has more efficient membrane permeation and crosses the blood brain barrier. We examined the effects of NACA in the secondary inflammatory response following focal penetrating TBI in rats. Material and methods Focal penetrating TBI were produced in a total of 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats randomly selected for treatment (n= 5), non-treatment (n= 5) and sham (n= 4). The treated animals were given NACA 300 mg/kg ip after 5 min and in the 24 h survival group a bolus of 300 mg/kg ip after 4 h. After 2 h and 24 h the brains were removed, cut in 14 µm coronal sections and subjected to immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, Fluoro-Jade and TUNEL analyses. Results NACA treatment decreased neuronal degeneration by Fluoro-Jade at 24 h (p<. 05). The levels of resident/invading macrophages/microglia in the perilesional area (ox- 42) were elevated at 2 h and 24 h, not differing between groups. The NO-producing inflammatory enzyme iNOS was up-regulated 24 h, not differing between groups. Oxidative stress measured by peroxynitrite surrogate marker 3 -Nitrotyrosine was detectible at 2 h and 24 h, not differing between groups. Antioxidative enzyme MnSOD was up regulated at 2 h and 24 h, expressing higher levels at 24 h in the NACA group (p<. 05). NFkB located in the nuclei was up-regulated at 2 h and 24 h, not differing between groups. Apoptotic cells by TUNEL was up regulated at 2 h and 24 h, with decreased levels at 2 h in the NACA group (p<. 05). Total levels of Cytochrome c and Bcl- 2 did not differ between groups. Conclusions NACA treatment decreased apoptosis and neuronal degeneration and increased antioxdative enzyme MnSOD. The antiapoptotic effect was not linked to alterations in total levels of Cytochrome c or Bcl- 2. Our results suggest that NACA treatment after focal TBI may be beneficial in preventing brain tissue damage, thus showing potential for clinical implications...|$|E
