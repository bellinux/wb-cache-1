40|$|<b>Condition-based</b> health <b>monitoring</b> {{systems are}} a very {{important}} addition to machinery to monitor the system and assure it is running at the peak efficiency, to schedule maintenance, and prevent catastrophic failure. Many times these systems are combined with different sensors to predict when service is required for different wear parts and this keeps the machine running optimally. An accurate prediction of health is accomplished by measuring and analyzing different critical parameters and detecting when these parameters deviate from the nominal values. Recently, these systems have started to become more common on industrial compression technology. Typically, reciprocating compressor health monitoring systems only use indirect measurements, P-V diagrams, to monitor {{the health of the}} system. This research focuses on improving these monitoring systems. Specifically this research will focus on three different valve failure modes that are common in reciprocating compressors. They are liquid slugging, valve spring fatigue, and valve seat wear. These faults are investigated first through a system level model to better understand how different subsystem dynamics are related through the compressor. Also an instrument investigation is conducted to determine what types of sensors are the most effective at detecting these faults. The Bayesian classification method is used in conjunction with seeded fault training data to create a classifier that can determine the state of health of the machine. The classification approach can be integrated into health monitoring software to be used in different reciprocating compressors...|$|R
30|$|Railway {{maintenance}} {{is crucial for}} increasing safety and to reduce costs [6]. Maintenance conducted by the Swedish Transportation Authority (TrV) is necessary to support railway resources and facilities [3, 7]. After railway stakeholders consider the data and the maintenance requirements, they can make policy decisions assisting Trafikverket. For this reason, support planning is used to identify the necessary resources for the desired maintenance tasks. The goal is to increase availability and reliability, while decreasing the risk of failure [8, 9].

It is used to define maintenance over predetermined time intervals or according to specific <b>monitoring</b> <b>condition-based</b> maintenance [10]. Condition-based maintenance (CBM) is another strategy for sufficient maintenance before an impending failure; it triggers maintenance when degradation occurs in the track. To realize this, Condition Monitoring (CM) is needed. CM means that the status of the railway track condition is monitored, recorded, and reported so that maintenance actions can be conducted before a problem occurs, thus reducing breakdowns which improves the overall track performance and reduces costs [11, 12].|$|R

40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Electrical Engineering for the MScMotors are the workhorses of the industry. Safety, reliability, efficiency, and performance {{are some of the}} major concerns and needs for motor system applications. The issue of preventive and <b>condition-based</b> maintenance, online <b>monitoring,</b> system fault detection, diagnosis, and prognosis are of increasing importance. The use of motors in today's industry is extensive and the motors can be exposed to different hostile environments, misoperations,manufacturing defect etc. Different internal motor faults (eg. inter-turn short circuits, short circuit of motor leads, ground faults, bearing and rotor faults) along with external motor faults are expected to happen sooner or later. // Early fault detection, diagnosis, and prognosis allow preventive condition based maintenance to be arranged for the motor system during scheduled downtime and prevent an extended period of downtime caused by system failures. // This thesis deals with the stator Faults and mainly for inter-turn short circuit fault. The faults related to the rotor and bearing also are considered in many research and developed successful fault diagnosis techniques. Literature survey revealed that Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based current spectrum analysis can be successfully applied in rotor and bearing faults analysis. // FFT based Inter-turn short circuit analysis, Air-gap flux sensing by external coils and Partial Discharge (PD) analysis have been discussed. This research has been focused to the negative sequence current analysis, since the FFT augmentation due to inter- turn fault is marginal. // A Power Decomposition Technique (PDT) has been used to derive positive and negative sequence components of measured voltage and current. A multi-phase based motor model is developed to simulate the inter turn fault and the results are verified by practical testing. The practical current waveforms are subjected to power decomposition based sequence component analysis in MAT LAB calculation platform. iv The practical testing has been done for loaded machine and the machine under no load condition to prove no load machine is more suitable for applying this technique.

40|$|Aging, {{man-made}} {{and natural}} hazards (e. g., earthquakes and hurricanes) may induce significant damage or even cause {{the collapse of}} civil structures. Such damage and failures imply life and economic losses, and function disruption of critical facilities; however, these devastating consequences can be reduced by means of accurate and timely risk mitigation decisions taken {{before and after the}} damage-inducing event. Structural health monitoring (SHM) has emerged as an attractive technology for the research and engineering communities to provide tools and protocols aiming to inform and prioritize the decision- making process and, therefore, has been accepted as a critical tool to achieve sustainable and resilient communities. <b>Condition-based</b> inspection and <b>monitoring</b> strategies to assess the residual life, detect any damage and safety threat at the earliest possible stage, and prioritize the repair or replacement of critical infrastructure are crucial preventive and proactive actions that can be facilitated by the use of advanced SHM methodologies. Because of recent advances in computational resources and cost reductions in sensor technologies, nowadays, dense and sophisticated sensor networks have been deployed and are collecting data for different types of civil structures throughout the world. However, current methods and practices in SHM are not achieving the goal of supporting the decision-making process. In this regard, two major hurdles are : (1) there is still a need to validate current state-of-the-art system identification (SID) and damage identification (DID) methods using data recorded from large and complex civil structures subjected to real or realistic damage-inducing events (e. g., man- made or natural hazards such as earthquakes), and (2) there is a disconnect between the advances made in the subfields of SHM and mechanics-based modeling and simulation of structures. This dissertation contributes to overcome these two hurdles by (1) analyzing vibration data recorded from a full-scale five-story reinforced concrete (RC) building fully outfitted with nonstructural components and systems, which was seismically tested and subjected to progressive damage on the NEES@UCSD shake table, and (2) developing and validating a novel and advanced SHM and DID framework that integrates high- fidelity mechanics-based nonlinear finite element (FE) structural modeling and analysis with state-of-the-art Bayesian inference methods. The first part of this dissertation focuses on SID and dynamic characterization of the full-scale five-story RC building specimen. Dynamic data for different sources of excitation, including ambient vibration as well as free and forced vibration tests, are used to investigate the evolution of the modal properties during construction of the building. Variations of the modal properties of the building, under both fixed- base and base-isolated configurations, due to the effects of nonstructural components, seismic-induced damage, and environmental conditions are explored comprehensively. In {{the second part of the}} dissertation, a novel framework is developed for system and damage identification of nonlinear structural systems subjected to known or unknown inputs. The proposed framework is validated using homogeneous and heterogeneous sensor data simulated from realistic nonlinear FE models of structures of increasing complexity, including 2 D and 3 D steel and RC frame structures, subjected to seismic excitation. Stochastic (Bayesian) filtering methods, including the Unscented Kalman filter and the Extended Kalman filter, are used to estimate unknown parameters of the FE model, unknown input base excitations, and their estimation uncertainties using spatially-sparse noisy measurements. By employing the estimated model parameters and input excitations, the updated nonlinear FE model can be interrogated to detect, localize, classify, and assess the damage in the structure, and can also be used for damage prognosis purpose...|$|R
