Hot-drawn CTA films show negative birefringence that decreases with increasing wavelength. On the other hand, CDA and CAP films show positive birefringence that increases with increasing wavelength, i. e., the so-called extraordinary wavelength dispersion of birefringence. Upon exposure to high humidity environment, the orientation birefringence of CDA and CAP decreases. The decrease is prominent for the samples containing {{a large amount of}} water. CTA, however, shows an increase in magnitude of its negative orientation birefringence with increasing moisture content. The results {{can be explained by the}} increase of the polarizability anisotropy perpendicular to the stretching direction in the <b>cellulose</b> <b>esters.</b> It is found from ATR-FTIR measurements that hydrogen bonds are formed between carbonyl groups of <b>cellulose</b> <b>esters</b> and water molecules. Considering that orientation birefringence of <b>cellulose</b> <b>esters</b> is determined mainly by ester groups, the formation of hydrogen bonds contributes to the polarizability anisotropy, thus affecting the orientation birefringence...|$|R

30|$|One of the {{important}} issues relevant to wood/plastic composite molding is the compatibility between hydrophilic wood and hydrophobic plastic. Polyolefins modified with maleic anhydride, which have been frequently used for wood and polyolefin composites, are not effective for poly(lactic acid) composites.

50|$|There is a gap {{of nearly}} twenty years between Merton's {{scientific}} papers of 1928 and 1947. In this interval he was busy in the laboratory and was taking out patents for his inventions. Diffraction gratings were one of his lifelong interests and here his inventive genius best showed itself. The rarity and expense of good diffraction gratings led him to devise, in 1935, a method of copying them without loss of optical quality, by applying {{a thin layer of}} a <b>cellulose</b> <b>ester</b> solution to an original plane grating.

40|$|Cellulose powder was acylated with {{mixtures}} containing acetic, fatty and acetic-fatty anhydrides to form acetic-fatty <b>cellulose</b> <b>esters.</b> The total {{degree of}} substitution (DS) of the mixed <b>cellulose</b> <b>esters</b> (MCE) ranged from 2 x 10 - 2 to 2. 92.

The values found were dependent on the fatty acyl content and independent of the acetyl content. In the case of acetic-oleic <b>cellulose</b> <b>esters,</b> the minimum DS of the oleoyl moiety required to obtain permanent water repellency was 3 x 10 - 4. The microporosity of the samples may account for this exceptional hydrophobic character. Nevertheless, water vapor adsorption measurements on powder samples revealed only a limited increase in hydrophobicity of the MCE compared to cellulose acetate with the same acetyl content.

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that the MWCO of a membrane is not a sharply defined value. Molecules with mass near the MWCO of the membrane will diffuse across the membrane slower than molecules significantly smaller than the MWCO. In order for a molecule to rapidly diffuse across a membrane it typically needs to be at least 20-50 times smaller than the membranes MWCO rating. Therefore, it is not practical to try separating a 30kDa protein from a 10kDa protein using dialysis across a 20K rated dialysis membrane.Dialysis tubing for laboratory use is typically made of a film of regenerated cellulose or <b>cellulose</b> <b>ester.</b> However; dialysis membranes made of polysulfone, polyethersulfone (PES), etched polycarbonate, or collagen are also extensively used for specific medical, food, or water treatment applications.|$|E

Cellulose from Oil Palm Empty Fruit Bunch (OPEFB) has a {{possibility}} {{to be converted}} into biodegradable plastic <b>cellulose</b> <b>ester</b> due to its huge availability. <b>Cellulose</b> <b>ester</b> has thermoplastic properties and is widely used in many polymer applications.

50|$|For {{dialysis}} applications, regenerated cellulose-based membranes are extruded as tubing or {{sheets and}} then dried. Glycerol is frequently added as a humectant to prevent cracking during drying {{and to help}} maintain the desired pore structure. Regenerated cellulose membranes are very hydrophilic and hydrate rapidly when introduced to water. Due to their additional crosslinking, regenerated cellulose membranes have better chemical compatibility and heat stability than membranes made from <b>cellulose</b> <b>esters.</b> Regenerated <b>cellulose</b> membranes are more resistant to organic solvents and to the weak or dilute acids and bases that are commonly used in protein and molecular biology applications. Membranes based on <b>cellulose</b> <b>esters</b> are typically supplied wet and come in a greater range of MWCOs. Pore sizes are typically more consistent across cellulose acetate membranes.|$|R
40|$|Cellulose esters {{with long}} carbon side chains (e. g. stearate) were {{produced}} via a homogenous reaction in ionic liquids. The degree of substitution was calculated to approximately 2. The melt rheology was studied for the pure cellulose esters but also combinations of the esters and polypropylene {{to study the}} processability of a blended composite material. It was shown that the compatibility between the two components was weak, {{which resulted in a}} phase-separated composite material. The morphology and permeability of water and oleic acid of the composite films were studied and it was shown that the water permeability decreased upon addition of the <b>cellulose</b> <b>ester</b> to the polymer. The permeability of oleic acid was however unchanged, which is most probable a result of high solubility in the <b>cellulose</b> <b>ester</b> rich domains of the composites.

40|$|Abstract. X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS) is {{a promising}} technique employed {{for the study}} of conducting polymers and their composites. XPS was used to study the surface chemistry of polyaniline-mixed <b>cellulose</b> <b>ester</b> (PANI-ME) composite membranes prepared by various chemical oxidative polymerization techniques such as insitu solution, vapour phase polymerizations and aniline polymerization using a two-compartment permeation cell. Hydrolytic degradation of surface deposited PANI and scission of cellulosic chains due to x-ray irradiation inside the XPS chamber influenced the quantification of polyaniline deposition levels as well as oxidation and doping states in PANI-ME membranes. N 1 s core level spectra allowed characterization of the PANI deposition level, its oxidation state and x-ray induced cellulosic ring cleavage. C 1 s and O 1 s core level spectra revealed PANI hydrolysis at the membrane surface. These degradation phenomena influence the performance of PANI composite membranes used specifically in electrodiffusion applications. It was shown that successful quantification of PANI deposition levels and its oxidation state on microporous mixed <b>cellulose</b> <b>ester</b> membranes using XPS could be realized by incorporating the degradation effects in the characterization results...|$|E
