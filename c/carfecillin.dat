50|$|<b>Carfecillin</b> is a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic. It is a phenyl {{derivative of}} carbenicillin, {{acting as a}} prodrug.|$|E
40|$|Blood {{and urine}} levels of {{carbenicillin}} were measured in 10 healthy volunteers and four patients with renal failure after single and multiple oral dose of <b>carfecillin.</b> Urinary levels after 1000 -mg doses in healthy subjects were considered sufficient {{for treatment of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa urinary infections, but the serum levels were too low for chemotherapy of systemic infections with this organism even in severe renal failure. Urinary infections were treated in 35 inpatients with a seven-day course of <b>carfecillin.</b> The infection was eradicated in 21 cases (60 %). In 12 cases the pathogen was Ps. aeruginosa, which was eradicated from eight patients (67 %). Many patients had severe urinary tract disease. Side effects were virtually absent...|$|E
40|$|<b>Carfecillin</b> was {{administered}} for urinary infection {{seen in the}} patients having indwelling catheter or renal stones, 11 caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3 by Proteus species. The total dosage was 56 grams for 14 days. Elimination of pathogens, improvement of urinary findings and subsidence of subjective symptoms were obtained in 54. 5 % of the cases infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and in 33. 3 % of the cases infected by Proteus species. Mild gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 21. 4 % of the cases. In vitro antibacterial activity of CBPC against 16 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the urine of patients was inferior to that of minocycline. But, under usual dosage, urinary excretion of CBPC is {{higher than that of}} minocycline, and <b>Carfecillin</b> appeared to be more advantageous for the case of Pseudomonas urinary tract infection than minocycline. Against Proteus mirabilis, antibacterial activity of CBPC was more sensitive than that of minocycline. Against another Proteus species, CBPC was inferior to minocycline except Proteus morganii...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our findings}} in the uses of <b>carfecillin</b> for treatment of 22 patients with urinary tract infections in a hospital urological department. Peak serum levels of 5 ng/ml were reached 1 h after oral administration of 1000 mg. Clinical and/or bacteriological improvement was found in 90 % of patients. One side effect, an allergic rash, was noted. During the treatment changes in the gut flora of the patients occurred leading {{to an increase in}} the number of carbenicillin resistant bacteria and increased rate of colonization with large numbers of Candida spp...|$|E
40|$|A {{range of}} {{penicillins}} {{have been examined}} as competitive reversible inhibitors of enkephalinase (neutral endopeptidase; EC 3. 4. 24. 11). <b>Carfecillin</b> (Ki = 0. 18 microM) was the most potent inhibitor in the series, whereas cloxacillin (27. 5 microM), ampicillin (41. 0 microM), nafcillin (58. 7 microM) and carbenicillin (158 microM) had moderate potency and benzyl penicillin (885 microM), mezlocillin (473 microM) and azlocillin (556 microM) were weak inhibitors. Structure-activity relationships within the series have been rationalised from a consideration of molecular graphics analysis of the match between receptor binding groups with thiorphan as well as log P values...|$|E
40|$|Sixty-three drugs, {{belonging}} to 10 chemical classes, {{were tested in}} vitro to determine effects on phagocytosis of P- 32 -labeled Staphylococcus aureus by neutrophils isolated from milk. Within each class, the number of antibiotics tested were: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID; 8), peptolids (2), aminoglycosides (8), tetracyclines and fusidic acid (4), beta-lactam antibiotics (25), secretolytic agents (2), macrolides (5), polypeptides (2), and antibacterial quinolones (8). Percentage of phagocytosis was determined after incubating (2 hours at 37 C) 12. 5 x 10 (6) viable neutrophils, 200 x 10 (6) P- 32 -labeled S aureus with antibiotics and 5 % skimmed milk. Concentrations of antibiotics tested were 1, 000, 500, and 10 -mu-g/ml of incubation media. When compared with nonantibiotic controls at the highest drug concentration, the NSAID acetylsalicylic acid and centrophenoxine increased phagocytosis 23. 2 and 8. 8 %, respectively, and benzydamine, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, and acetominophen decreased phagocytosis 22. 8, 14. 2, 9. 8, 27. 0, and 18. 2 %, respectively. The peptolids novobiocin and pristinamycin decreased phagocytosis 24. 5 and 22. 0 %, respectively. The aminoglycosides tobramycin, amikacin, and gentamicin decreased phagocytosis 21. 1, 15. 4, and 19. 2 % respectively. For the tetracyclines and fusidic acid, minocycline and doxycycline decreased phagocytosis 39. 8 and 54. 2 %, respectively. The beta-lactam antibiotics <b>carfecillin,</b> cephapirin sodium, and cephacetrile sodium decreased phagocytosis 11. 2, 12. 8, and 23. 8 %, respectively. The secretolytic agent, bromhexin, increased phagocytosis 10. 8 %. These data indicate that the potential for enhanced phagocytosis exists through use of some NSAID, and for depressed phagocytosis through use of aminoglycosides, peptolids, tetracyclines, and beta-lactams, as well as certain other NSAID...|$|E
