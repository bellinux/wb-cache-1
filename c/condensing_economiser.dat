40|$|British Steel Tinplate of Ebbw Vale, South Wales fitted a CEECON <b>condensing</b> <b>economiser</b> to {{a boiler}} {{to take full}} {{advantage}} of their cold nitrogen deaerated boiler feedwater. Following modifications to the <b>condensing</b> <b>economiser</b> in the early stages of the project the unit has operated succesfully. The average boiler efficiency, on a gross calorific basis, has increased to 90. 2 %, saving 34, 228 Gj annually compared to a boiler without an economiser and 23, 151 Gj compared to a conventional economiser...|$|E
40|$|This study {{applies the}} Total Site Heat Integration method, in {{conjunction}} with a detailed process and utility model, to investigate three methods to increase the energy efficiency of the utility supply system for milk powder production. Sequentially explored opportunities are: (1) increasing boiler efficiency through condensing economisers, (2) waste heat recovery from the chiller unit, and (3) Combined Heat and Power (CHP) for electricity production. The basis for the analysis is the anticipated future milk powder process design, which incorporates results from recent studies that have focused on improving the process design and integration of the heat treatment and evaporator systems and recovering heat from the spray dryer exhaust, which show a combined specific fuel consumption reduction of 29. 6 % and a relatively small increase in electricity use of 4. 5 %. To maximise boiler efficiency, the study concludes that a <b>condensing</b> <b>economiser</b> for the flue gas can be indirectly matched with heating fluidised bed air flows through the boiler condensate system, which results in specific fuel use reduction of 227 MJ/tp. Chiller waste heat can be upgraded and integrated as a heat source to replace the equivalent specific fuel use of 101 MJ/tp through integration with the site low temperature hot water loop. By designing the steam system to maximise electricity generation in a new turbine, results show that 51 % of the site’s electricity demand may be satisfied by CHP. The combined effect of implementing these three utility systems opportunities is a specific fuel use of 3, 868 MJ/tₚ, of which 530 MJ/tₚ result from electricity production, and a specific grid electricity demand of 113. 4 kWh/tₚ...|$|E
40|$|The {{food and}} {{beverage}} industries are significant industrial producers of green-house gas (GHG) emissions. Reductions {{can be achieved by}} increased energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy to replace fossil fuel use. The main efficiency method within this industries is the use of low temperature heat (LTH), i. e. below 100 °C. Sources for LTH include heat recovery from process flows, heat rejection from utility operations (i. e. chillers, combined heat and power (CHP), <b>condensing</b> <b>economisers),</b> and renewable energy (i. e. solar thermal). A hybrid heating system (H 2 S) has been developed that can retrofit steam heater designs for the integration of LTH. Two different systems have been found, for adapting direct and indirect steam heaters, either installing an extra hot water heater or using the indirect hot water loop for the integration. In both systems the existing steam heater remains a part of the system for individual back-up. The set-up and the control algorithm of the H₂S allow installing a 37 % smaller hot water grid than a common design with one central back-up heater. Investigations using a comprehensive model of a whey separation and drying plant showed that implementing a piston engine CHP unit combined with the H₂S reduce the energy costs by 42 % and the GHG emissions by 33 %...|$|R
