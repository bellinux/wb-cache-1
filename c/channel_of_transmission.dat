60|$|Concluding Remarks on the Effects of the {{foregoing}} Agents.--As the glands, when excited, transmit some influence to the surrounding tentacles, causing them to bend and their glands to pour forth an increased amount of modified secretion, I was anxious to ascertain whether the leaves included any element having the nature of nerve-tissue, which, though not continuous, served as the <b>channel</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> This led me to try the several alkaloids and other substances which are known to exert a powerful influence on the nervous system of animals; I was at first encouraged in my trials by finding that strychnine, digitaline, and nicotine, which all act on the nervous system, were poisonous to Drosera, and caused {{a certain amount of}} inflection. Hydrocyanic acid, again, which is so deadly a poison to animals, caused rapid movement of the tentacles. But as several innocuous acids, though much diluted, such as benzoic, acetic, &c., as well as some essential oils, are extremely poisonous to Drosera, and quickly cause strong inflection, it seems probable that strychnine, nicotine, digitaline, and hydrocyanic acid, excite inflection by acting on elements in no way analogous to the nerve-cells of animals. If elements of this latter nature had been present in the leaves, it might have been expected that morphia, hyoscyamus, atropine, veratrine, colchicine, curare, and diluted alcohol would have produced some marked effect; whereas [page 224] these substances are not poisonous and have no power, or only a very slight one, of inducing inflection. It should, however, be observed that curare, colchicine, and veratrine are muscle-poisons--that is, act on nerves having some special relation with the muscles, and, therefore, could not be expected to act on Drosera. The poison of the cobra is most deadly to animals, by paralysing their nerve-centres,* yet is not in the least so to Drosera, though quickly causing strong inflection.|$|E

Given that the United States (US) was the crisis epicenter, the authors analyze the factors driving the co-movement between US returns and stock returns in 83 countries. The analysis distinguishes between the period {{before and after the}} collapse of Lehman Brothers. The findings indicate that the main <b>channel</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> was financial. There is also evidence of a"wake-up call"or"demonstration effect"in the first stage of the crisis, because countries with vulnerable banking and corporate sectors exhibited higher co-movement with the US market.

40|$|This paper studies {{whether and}} how U. S. {{monetary}} shocks are transmitted to emerging economies utilizing as samples Mexico and Brazil. A Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) methodology is employed {{to take advantage of}} the wide array of variables that can be included in this model to provide a more accurate picture of the transmission process. The results suggest that differences exist in the transmission of foreign monetary shocks. This implies that no generalizations can be made even for countries of equal economic size and in the same geographic region. When international transmission does exist, as it is in the case of Mexico, it induces large responses in several macroeconomic variables. Interest rate is the main <b>channel</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission,</b> with some impact on the trade channel. Although little transmission exists in the case of Brazil, it appears that this country slightly benefits from U. S. contractional monetary shocks.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of inflation target for Indonesia is a desirable option of monetary policy. This decision is induced by {{new system of}} exchange rate that is used of Indonesia since August 1997. The economics and institutional pre-condition {{is required for the}} successful {{adoption of}} inflation targeting. The paper focuses on two issues. First, how is transmission mechanism of monetary policy? Second, is the dominant <b>channel</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> mechanism will support the inflation targeting adoption?

The quarterly Indonesia data for the 1981. 1 – 2004. 2 periods dan the Vector Autoregressions is used as data and method for transmission mechanism model. The empirical results show that real exchange rate is a dominant <b>channel</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> mechanism. The shocks of real exchange rate will influence output and inflation immediately. The domestic interest rate shocks will affect the output and inflation weaker and slower then real exchange rate shocks. The application of inflation targeting in Indonesia still needs institutional and public commitment to improve the structural economy condition, policy coordination and some other technical issues...|$|E
30|$|To conclude, the {{evidence}} for the USA points to a robust influence of past slavery on inequality, while the influence on current income levels is somewhat weaker. The main <b>channel</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> {{is to be found}} in the unequal access to education and the accumulation of human capital for the descendants of slaves.

Our findings suggest that the main <b>channel</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> from financial development to growth is the efficiency of investment, rather than its volume.

40|$|A {{major feature}} characterizing recent {{currency}} crises in emerging markets {{has been the}} large proportion of private foreign currency debt. This feature has made the conduct of monetary policy particularly difficult. This paper proposes a simple model to better understand these issues where firms are credit constrained and the currency denomination of debt matters. I argue that the recent financial crises are well explained by such a model. In this framework, monetary policy can be ineffective since the interest rate and the exchange rate <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> monetary policy go in opposite directions.
