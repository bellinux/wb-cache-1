50|$|There {{are also}} other systems of {{fastener}} retention {{that do not}} rely on safety wire at all, such as lock washers, locknuts, jam nuts, thread-locking fluid, castellated nuts and <b>cotter</b> <b>pins,</b> all of which accomplish the same objective as safety wire, which is to prevent vibration or other forces from causing the undesired loosening of a mechanical fastener.|$|E
5000|$|... 7-122. GENERAL. The word {{safetying}} {{is a term}} universally used in {{the aircraft}} industry. Briefly, safetying is defined as: [...] "Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on the aircraft so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation." [...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, snap rings, oil caps, drain cocks, valves, and parts. Three basic methods are used in safetying; safety-wire, <b>cotter</b> <b>pins,</b> and self-locking nuts. Retainer washers and pal nuts are also sometimes used.|$|E
50|$|Because all {{the load}} is on one very small {{area of the}} <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> and the crank land the <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> deforms plastically under normal use and so must be {{replaced}} regularly. If this is not done the crank and the spindle wear and must be replaced. There is warning because of a characteristic creak sound that aging pins cause the cranks to make.|$|R

5000|$|There {{were many}} forms of {{fastening}} in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as dowels and pins, wedging, mortises and tenons, dovetails, nailing (with or without clenching the nail ends), forge welding, and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of knots. Prior to the mid-19th century, <b>cotter</b> <b>pins</b> or pin bolts, and [...] "clinch bolts" [...] (now called rivets), were used in shipbuilding. Glues also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.|$|E
50|$|In about 1933, Simmonds took {{ship for}} the USA and {{followed}} up {{with some of the}} US contacts he had made back in the Schneider Trophy days. One of these contacts showed him a new nut, which was unique in that it had a red fiber insert, which caused the nut to retain its position on a bolt, irrespective of vibration. Simmonds realized this nut, being produced by the Elastic Stop Nut Corporation of Cleveland, Ohio had the potential to do away with <b>cotter</b> <b>pins,</b> which at that time were used on virtually all aircraft fasteners. The holder of the worldwide patents was a Swede named Renefelt. After a number of meetings Simmonds obtained an exclusive license {{for the rest of the}} world, with the exception of the USA and Sweden. The two licenses for the Push Pull Control and the Elastic Stop Nut became the basis of the company's early rapid growth. In the second half of the 1930s Simmonds established his own manufacturing facilities in the UK, France, Poland, the USA and Australia. Offices were also established in Canada.|$|E

50|$|A pin shackle {{is closed}} with an anchor bolt and <b>cotter</b> <b>pin,</b> {{in a manner}} similar to a clevis. It is for this reason they are often {{referred}} to, in industrial jargon, as clevises. Pin shackles can be inconvenient to work with, at times, as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss, usually with a split pin or seizing wire. A more secure version used in crane rigging features the combination of a securing nut (hardware) located alongside the <b>cotter</b> <b>pin.</b> Pin shackles are practical in many rigging applications where the anchor bolt is expected to experience some rotation.|$|R

2500|$|On July 7, 2005, BC Ferries {{concluded}} that a missing <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> was to blame. The pin normally retained a nut on a linkage between an engine speed governor and the fuel control {{for one of the}} engines. Without the pin, the nut fell off and the linkage separated, causing the engine, [...] clutches, and propellers to increase in speed until overspeed safety devices tripped and shut down the entire propulsion system. The faulty speed governor had been serviced 17 days before the incident during a $35-million upgrade, and the <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> had not been properly replaced at that time.|$|R

40|$|Dublin 2 ̆ 7 s nineteenth-century Tobacco Store {{built by}} John Rennie(1761 - 1821) is {{considered}} significant {{due to its}} cast-and wrought-iron roof trusses. Though {{by no means the}} first to experiment with iron, Rennie had been a firm believer in the superiority of this material over timber in warehouse construction and used it extensively throughout his portfolio. Less acknowledged is that a similar, yet more advanced truss was used in the New West Stores (demolished 1988), also built as part of the Dublin Docks ensemble by Rennie. That this achievement was overlooked was a result of the roof structure being replaced with a less adventurous timber roof following its collapse in afire in 1833, ten years after its completion. Archival evidence suggests that the original cast-and wrought-iron truss designed by Rennie for the New West Stores mirrored that of the earlier Tobacco Store in profile consisting of queen-post truss, surmounted by a lantern structure and a smaller kingpost truss. However, this later truss far exceeded the earlier structure in span, being 52 foot 6 inches in comparison to the 38 foot 9 inch span of the Tobacco Store. As studies in the evolution of iron truss technology have suggested that the span of early trusses were limited to 40 feet, which was not exceeded until after the 1830 swhen such inventions as the Polonceau truss and various arched truss technologies were introduced, this early truss by Rennie was a significant achievement in the 1820 s.

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} standards of crank interface, cottered cranks are now considered obsolete in Western countries, but are still in common use in China, India and other developing nations. The spindle is a cylinder, and has a flat region across it (a land). The crank has a hole through it to fit onto the spindle, with a transverse hole for the <b>cotter</b> <b>pin.</b> The <b>cotter</b> <b>pin</b> is cylindrical with one side flattened {{at an angle to}} form a wedge to match the spindle land. When tightened, this produces a simple and effective interface. The problem is that normally the interface cannot be tightened enough without a cotter press, a highly specialized tool, though still produced and for sale. Cotters can also be installed with an improvised tool designed for another purpose, such as a ball joint splitter or hammer, with mixed results.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{researches}} was the necessity of deep study of hydraulic dimensionless expense descriptions of regulative organ of model standard of band regulator of water, for rice checks. Rice {{is one of the}} most moisture-loving agricultural cultures. Its productivity straightly depends on adjusting of water level in rice <b>cotter</b> <b>pins</b> on the different periods of development of this culture: period of primary submergence of check, fight against weeds, primary vegetation, phases of bushing out, vegetations of suckling and cereous ripeness. On each of the considered periods of development of plant the guided water level is needed, that high-quality can be realized only at application of the systems of automatic control. In rice irrigation systems there is plenty enough of losses of water due to not managed leakage in regulator flow and water level in the closed position. An actual and meaningful task is development, research and introduction in practice of reliable and high-efficiency regulators expense and water level for rice checks. The article presents results of research of hydraulic dimensionless expense descriptions of regulative organ of model standard, developed by us. Intercommunication of degree of influence is investigational, on the basis of application of methods of planning of experiment, on the function of response, which dimensionless expense description of regulative organ of model standard of band regulator of water, relations of diameters of the downlow openings, is taken for, at the different relation of workers pressures. From appraised experimental data approximation dependences, which were in same queue analysed for the purpose cross-correlation connection, determination, elasticity, are built. Also, in the article there is an estimation of statistical meaningfulness of the built model of regression given with the use of criterion of F - Fishera and parameters of equalization of regression with the use of criterion of t - St'yudenta, at the set level of meaningfulness α. At the permanent relations of workers pressures the analysis of sections of surface of response H/Нmax 0, 6; 0, 8; 1, 0 shows that functions have extremums on a maximum. At minimum relations of workers pressures H/Нmax equal 0, 6 the maximal value of function of response is equal 81 % it will be at the relation of diameters of the downlow openings of d/dmax equal 0, 9. With the increase of relation of workers pressures H/Нmax to 0, 8 have a trend of maximum toward an increase and here he comes at the value of function of response equal 94 % and relation of diameters of the downlow openings of d/dmax equal 0, 92. Further increase of relation of workers pressures of H/Нmax to 1, 0 also results in the trend of a maximum of function of response which arrives at a value 118 %, here the relation of diameters of the downlow openings of d/dmax is equal to 0, 94. The combined analysis of curves shows that at any relation of workers pressures, the degree of influence on the function of response increases due to more relation of diameters of the downlow opening...|$|E
