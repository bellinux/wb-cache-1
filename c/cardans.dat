40|$|Abstract- It is {{of great}} {{significance}} for improving the landing stability and adjusting the attitude of equipment base by designing a <b>cardan</b> mechanism in the asteroid lander. In the paper, a <b>cardan</b> mechanism having cushion and attitude adjusting functions is designed for the asteroid lander. The <b>cardan</b> mechanism contains electromagnetic damping, belt transmission and cross-shaft, and it has merits of adjustable damping and bearing large overload. The attitude control system of the <b>cardan</b> mechanism is built by FPGA chip. Kinematics and kinetics of the <b>cardan</b> mechanism are analyzed for attitude control. Complex feedback PD controller is applied to control {{the attitude of the}} <b>cardan</b> mechanism as large mass equipment base would influence control performance. This controller contains real time gravity compensation, desired acceleration compensation and velocity feed forward compensation. The experiments show that the <b>cardan</b> mechanism designed in this paper has good performance by adopting Complex feedback PD controller...|$|R

40|$|In {{machine design}} we {{always want to}} save space, save energy and produce as much power as possible. We can often reduce accelerations, {{inertial}} loads and energy consumption by changing construction. In this study the old <b>cardan</b> gear mechanism (hypocycloid mechanism) has been compared with the conventional slider-crank mechanism in air pumps and four-stroke engines. Comprehensive Newtonian dynamics has been derived for the both mechanisms. First the slidercrank and the <b>cardan</b> gear machines have been studied as lossless systems. Then the friction losses {{have been added to}} the calculations. The calculation results show that the <b>cardan</b> gear machines can be more efficient than the slider-crank machines. The smooth running, low mass inertia, high pressures and small frictional power losses make the <b>cardan</b> gear machines clearly better than the slider-crank machines. The dynamic tooth loads of the original <b>cardan</b> gear construction do not rise very high when the tooth clearances are kept tight. On the other hand the half-size crank length causes high bearing forces in the <b>cardan</b> gear machines. The friction losses of the <b>cardan</b> gear machines are generally quite small. The mechanical efficiencies are much higher in the <b>cardan</b> gear machines than in the slider-crank machines in normal use. Crankshaft torques and power needs are smaller in the <b>cardan</b> gear air pumps than in the equal slider-crank air pumps. The mean crankshaft torque and the mean output power are higher in the <b>cardan</b> gear four-stroke engines than in the slider-crank four-stroke engines in normal use. The <b>cardan</b> gear mechanism is at its best, when we want to build a pump or an engine with a long connecting rod (≈ 5 ⋅crank length) and a thin piston (≈ 1. 5 ⋅crank length) rotating at high angular velocity and intermittently high angular acceleration. The <b>cardan</b> gear machines can be designed also as slide constructions without gears. Suitable applications of the <b>cardan</b> gear machines are three-cylinder half-radial engines for motorcycles, sixcylinder radial engines for airplanes and six-cylinder double half-radial engines for sport cars. The applied equations of Newtonian dynamics, comparative calculations, calculation results (tables, curves and surface plots) and recommendations presented in this study hold novelty value and are unpublished before. They have been made and written by the author first time in this study...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the special}} {{location}} and structure of transmission system on high-speed train named CRH 5, dynamic unbalance state of the <b>cardan</b> shaft will {{pose a threat to}} the train servicing safety, so effective methods that test the <b>cardan</b> shaft operating information and estimate the performance state in real time are needed. In this study a useful estimation method based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is presented. By using this method, time-frequency characteristic of <b>cardan</b> shaft can be extracted effectively by separating the gearbox vibration acceleration data. Preliminary analysis suggests that the pinions rotating vibration separated from gearbox vibration by EEMD can be used as important assessment basis to estimate <b>cardan</b> shaft state. With two sets gearbox vibration signals collected from the in-service train at different running speed, the comparative analysis verifies that the proposed method has high effectiveness for cardan-shaft state estimate. Of course, it needs further research to quantify the performance state of <b>cardan</b> shaft based on this method...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate the cardiovascular effect of three extracts from the root bark of Anthocleista schweinfurthii Gilg. : an aqueous extract (AE), a dichloromethane extract (DCMR) and a fraction enriched in cardiac glycoside type compounds (<b>CARDAN).</b> In isolated perfused frog heart, bolus injection of the extracts produced a positive inotropic effect. The responses to AE and DCMR, but not to <b>CARDAN,</b> were depressed by propranolol. In isolated rat aorta, DCMR produced a transient increase in contractile tension while AE and <b>CARDAN</b> induced a sustained constriction. AE vasoconstrictor effect was abolished by phentolamine, while contraction evoked by <b>CARDAN</b> was antagonized by verapamil. In aortic rings contracted in low K+ media, the addition of K+ evoked a relaxation, which was abolished by ouabain, depressed by DCMR but not affected by either A(E) or <b>CARDAN.</b> These observations indicate that Anthocleista schweinfurthii contains substances that promote vasoconstriction and increase cardiac contraction. The effect of DCMR was only partially mediated by inhibition of the Na+ pump while the mechanism of action of A(E) and <b>CARDAN</b> was distinct from the inhibition of the Na+, K+ - ATPase pump, but could involve adrenergic receptors, or either direct or indirect activation of L-type calcium channels...|$|R

40|$|Tower {{structure}} {{is sensitive to}} hurricane and earthquake, and {{it is easy to}} generate large deflection and dynamic response. The multiple <b>cardan</b> gyroscope has two rotational degrees of freedom, which can generate strong moments to constrain the two horizontal orthogonal deflections if the rotor operates in high speeds, so the structural dynamic responses can be decreased. Hence, the method of dynamic control of the tower structure under wind load and earthquake action is proposed by using the multiple <b>cardan</b> gyroscopes as the dampers. The dynamic mechanism and the fixed axis principle of the multiple <b>cardan</b> gyroscope are introduced, and the dynamic equation of the gyroscope is established. The damping mechanism of the gyroscope is also described. For the tower structure equipped with the multiple <b>cardan</b> gyroscope dampers, the multidimensional control equation considering torsion effect is established, and the equivalent state space equation is presented. Taking a TV Tower with a number of gyroscope dampers as an analysis example, the structural dynamic responses and damping performance under fluctuating wind loads and earthquake action is studied. The results show that the multiple <b>cardan</b> gyroscope dampers with suitable parameters can effectively decrease the structural vibration in horizontal directions and torsional direction...|$|R
