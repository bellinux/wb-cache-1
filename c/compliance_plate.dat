50|$|Additionally, three regular {{production}} Falcon GT sedans - especially {{painted in}} Brambles Red - {{had been in}} the process of being developed for racing to GT-HO specification by Ford Special Vehicles Division and were to be raced at Bathurst in 1972 by factory drivers Allan Moffat and Fred Gibson. With the abandonment of the XA Falcon GT-HO as a production car, development was immediately halted on the three race cars and they were sold off. However, one of these cars did go on to serve a life in motorsport, specifically as a rally car campaigned by Bruce Hodgson. It was later destroyed in a road accident. Although the three cars featured standard Falcon GT <b>compliance</b> <b>plates,</b> they are considered by most Ford fans to be race-prepared versions of the XA Falcon GT-HO Phase IV.|$|R

50|$|The HG {{series of}} July 1970 {{was a minor}} {{refinement}} of the existing formula, adopted as the marketing platform for the new three-speed automatic transmission option called Tri-Matic. The first of these locally made transmissions actually {{found their way into}} the last of the HT series cars. These transmissions were later criticised for unreliability and became colloquially known by dispondants, as the Traumatic. Only the HG Monaro GTS350 retained the Powerglide transmission if an automatic preference was optioned.HG commercial variants continued to be built and sold alongside the HQ series passenger vehicles until very late in 1971 when the HQ commercials were released.

5000|$|The XE Fairmont Ghia ESP (option 54) was an {{optional}} pack that {{was chosen by}} the purchaser when ordering their new car, it varied in trim, styles and motors. Examples of ESP upgrades are, two-tone Charcoal-accented paint or base Ghia paint, Scheel-brand front bucket seats or Ghia Seats, 351 cuin L Cleveland V8 or 250 cuin L EFI Crossflow, 3 speed C4 auto or 4 speed single rail manual. Most ESP optioned Ghias are easily distinguishable from the Fairmont Ghia, however, many Option 54 Fairmont Ghias look so similar to the Fairmont Ghia that most owners of a used example do not realise they have an ESP {{as there is no}} code on the <b>compliance</b> <b>plate</b> to distinguish this. The only way to ascertain if a Fairmont Ghia is a genuine ESP is to contact Ford Australia with the compliance details and have the vehicles original purchase order examined for [...] "option 54".

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the interaction of}} ice and structures under simplified dynamic impact conditions, where the compliance of the structure and geometry of the ice was varied. Laboratory ice and iceberg ice conical specimens were impacted with a simply supported steel plate in a pendulum impact apparatus. The geometry of the ice cone was varied from 20 to 40 degrees and {{the thickness of the}} steel plate was varied from 0. 25 " to 0. 75 ". Initial potential energy remained constant for each experiment. Forces, nominal pressures and specific energies were analyzed using response surface methodology. The <b>compliance</b> of the <b>plate</b> and cone angle of the ice specimen showed significant influence on the peak forces and nominal pressures.

25|$|Several {{experiments}} varied {{the immediacy}} of the teacher and learner. Generally, when the victim's physical immediacy was increased, the participant's compliance decreased. The participant's compliance also decreased when the authority's physical immediacy decreased (Experiments 1–4). For example, in Experiment 2, where participants received telephonic instructions from the experimenter, compliance decreased to 21 percent. Interestingly, some participants deceived the experimenter by pretending to continue the experiment. In the variation where the learner's physical immediacy was closest, where participants had to hold the learner's arm physically onto a shock <b>plate,</b> <b>compliance</b> decreased. Under that condition, 30 percent of participants completed the experiment.|$|R

We present equivalent-circuit-based design fundamentals for an airborne CMUT cell and verify the design targets using fabricated CMUTs. The performance limits for silicon plates are derived. We experimentally obtain 78. 9 dB// 20 μPa@ 1 m source level at 73. 7 kHz, with a CMUT cell of radius 2. 05 mm driven by 71 V sinusoidal drive voltage at half the frequency.

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{portion of}} a joint government/industry/university research study on the vibrational characteristics of twisted cantilevered plates is presented. The overall purpose of the research study {{was to assess the}} capabilities and limitations of existing analytical methods in predicting the vibratory characteristics of twisted plates. Thirty cantilevered plates were precision machined at the Air Force's Aero Propulsion Laboratory. These plates, having five different degrees of twist, two thicknesses, and three aspect ratios representative of turbine engine blade geometries, were tested for their vibration mode shapes and frequencies. The resulting nondimensional frequencies and selected mode shapes are presented as a function of plate tip twist. The trends of the natural frequencies {{as a function of the}} governing geometric parameters are discussed. The effect of support <b>compliance</b> on the <b>plate</b> natural frequency and its impact on numerically modeling twisted plates is also presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} called the crack-tip force method (CTFM) is derived for {{computing}} the energy release rate in delaminated beams and plates. In this method the delaminated plate {{is divided into}} two laminates {{on either side of the}} plane of delamination. The interaction forces, called crack-tip forces, between the sub-laminates at the crack-tip are computed. The energy release rate is ex-pressed as a quadratic function of the crack-tip forces and the <b>plate</b> <b>compliance</b> coefficients. The CTFM is compared to the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) as well as to a previously derived method called the strain energy density method using double cantilevered beam specimens as examples. The CTFM is found to be very efficient as the crack-tip forces are part of the solution of finite element analysis of delaminated plates, and they can be readily used to compute the point-wise energy release rate along th...|$|R
40|$|This paper applies optimum {{structural}} {{topological design}} methodologies to the stiffening of plates in bending. The {{purpose of the}} design {{is to use a}} given amount of material as orthogonal stiffeners to minimize the <b>compliance</b> of <b>plates</b> in bending. Cheng and Olhoff had shown that if left unchecked, this formulation includes dense sets of infinitely thin stiffeners – a solution though optimal, obviously impractical. In order to circumvent the obstacle, the present formulation assumes a plate meshed by an orthogonal lattice with rectangular elements allowing the stiffeners be positioned only {{along the lines of the}} mesh. Assuming that the mesh has l longitudinal and t transversal lines, the basic problem is to add, in an optimal fashion, uniform beams along these lines, subjected to a constraint on the amount of material. The stiffening beams are assumed of rectangular cross-sections of constant height, with their widths or densities taken as the design variables xi, i= 1, [...] , l+t of the problem. In the present form, we have stated a standard topological design problem that calls for the minimization of the compliance, subjected to a constraint on the amount of material, which can be solved by classical optimization techniques, not unlike the erstwhile topology optimization for 2 D membrane problems, using density design variables. We, then, limit the stiffening grid to stiffeners of a constant cross-section and ask to locate a given length of stiffeners material along its longitudinal and/or transversal lines, in order to minimize the compliance. The design variables are still the continuous widths x i of the beams, with the understanding that eventually a 0 / 1 solution is to be reached. In standard topological design, a SIMP material is usually employed for that purpose. In the present work we use the SRV constraint, which was recently introduced in topology design of structure...|$|R
40|$|Background: The haptic {{perception}} of ground compliance {{is used for}} stable regulation of dynamic posture and the control of locomotion in diverse natural environments. Although rarely investigated in relation to walking, vibrotactile sensory channels {{are known to be}} active in the discrimination of material properties of objects and surfaces through touch. This study investigated how the perception of ground surface compliance is altered by plantar vibration feedback. Methodology/Principal Findings: Subjects walked in shoes over a rigid floor plate that provided plantar vibration feedback, and responded indicating how compliant it felt, either in subjective magnitude or via pairwise comparisons. In one experiment, the compliance of the floor plate was also varied. Results showed that perceived <b>compliance</b> of the <b>plate</b> increased monotonically with vibration feedback intensity, and depended to a lesser extent on the temporal or frequency distribution of the feedback. When both <b>plate</b> stiffness (inverse <b>compliance)</b> and vibration amplitude were manipulated, the effect persisted, with both factors contributing to compliance perception. A significant influence of vibration was observed even for amplitudes close to psychophysical detection thresholds.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the acoustic properties of a rigid plate with a periodic pattern of holes, in a compressible, ideal, inviscid fluid in the absence of mean flow. Leppington and Levine (J. Fluid Mech., 1973) obtained an approximation of the reflection and transmission coefficients of a plane wave incident on an infinitely thin plate with a rectangular array of perforations, assuming that a characteristic size of the perforations is negligible relative to that of the unit cell of the grating, itself assumed to be negligible relative to the wavelength. One part of the present study is of methodological interest. It establishes {{that it is possible to}} extend their approach to thick plates with a skew grating of perforations, thus confirming recent results in Bendali et al. (SIAM J. Appl. Math., 2013), but in a much simpler way without using complex matched asymptotic expansions of the full wave or to a grating of multipoles. As is well-known, effective <b>compliances</b> for the <b>plate</b> can then be derived from the corresponding approximations of the reflection and transmission coefficients. These compliances are expressed in terms of the Rayleigh conductivity of an isolated perforation. Consequently, in one other part of the present study, the methodology recently introduced in Laurens et al. (ESAIM:M 2 AN, 2013) to obtain sharp bounds for the Rayleigh conductivity has been extended to include the case for which the openings of the perforations on the upper and lower sides of the plate are elliptical in shape. This not only enables the determination of these bounds and of the associated reflection and transmission coefficients for actual plates with tilted perforations but also yields single expressions covering all usual cases of perforations: straight or tilted with a circular or an elliptical cross-section...|$|R
