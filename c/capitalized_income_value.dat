30|$|Before moving on, it {{is worth}} {{pointing}} out the well-established fact that the Gorman Polar Form does not necessarily give rise to well-behaved preferences {{in all parts of}} the quantity-space: in general, well-behaved preferences only apply to a limited range of possible <b>income</b> <b>values.</b> For instance, for some <b>income</b> <b>values,</b> the linear Engel curves may lead to negative consumption or cross with each other. To avoid such problems, Gorman Polar Form preferences are usually defined subject to bounds on possible income levels. 3 To keep the exposition simple, our following analysis only considers <b>income</b> <b>values</b> that lie within such income ranges and, thus, we will not explicitly consider income bounds in our exposition. But it should be kept in mind that our following characterisations of Gorman Polar Form preferences and exact linear aggregation are essentially “local” in that they apply to sufficiently small changes in the incomes of individual consumers. In our proof of Theorem 2, we indicate how the relevant income bounds can be computed in empirical applications [see our discussion of program (3) in Appendix 1].|$|R

When the probabilities of nonresponse are assumed {{to depend on the}} observed information and not on the underlining unobserved amounts, the missing <b>income</b> <b>values</b> are missing at random (MAR), and methods such as sequential multiple imputation can be applied. However, the MAR assumption is often considered questionable in this context, since missingness of income is thought {{to be related to the}} <b>value</b> of <b>income</b> itself, after conditioning on available covariates. In this article we describe a sensitivity analysis based on a pattern-mixture model for deviations from MAR, in the context of missing <b>income</b> <b>values</b> in a rotating panel survey.

Private amenities — such as recreation, scenic beauty and a rural lifestyle — are considered an important influence on rangeland owners, but {{few studies have}} attempted to place a monetary <b>income</b> <b>value</b> on them. Landowners were asked to estimate {{the maximum amount of}} earnings that they were willing to forgo before selling their property to invest in more commercially profitable, nonagrarian assets, and the proportion of the land price that they thought was explained by private amenities from their land. On average, landowners were willing to pay $ 54 per acre annually for private amenities, and they attributed 57 % of the land price to them. Regression analysis revealed that the landowners’ willingness to pay per acre decreased as property size increased. This approach sheds light on how landowners value the benefits of land owner-ship and offers insights for outreach and policy development for privately owned oak woodlands...|$|R

In this paper, we provide input to this debate by documenting the impact of dirty surplus flows, and cross-regime differences therein, from a perspective that has generated particular concerns about dirty surplus accounting, namely accounting-based valuation. We {{examine the effect of}} the omission of dirty surplus flows in creating bias and inaccuracy in perfect-foresight residual <b>income</b> <b>value</b> estimates with respect to clean surplus-based value estimates, and test for cross-regime differences in this effect. On the criterion of bias, the effects are largely limited to goodwill-related flows, which regulators are eliminating as a dirty surplus item. On the criterion of inaccuracy, all classes of dirty surplus flow give rise to some significant effects. We also compare the clean surplus-based formulation and the dirty surplus-based formulation as regards bias and inaccuracy with respect to observed market values, and find no clear evidence that either is superior to the other in this regard.
