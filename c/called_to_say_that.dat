500|$|Until {{the time}} of his death, reports of his having been a ringer angered Schulz. [...] While he did work in a steel mill, Schulz insisted that he did not [...] "come out" [...] of the steel mill to play {{football}}. [...] Instead, Schulz said he [...] "went into" [...] the mill to harden himself up for the football season. [...] When asked years later how he got to Michigan, Schulz recalled that, in the summer of 1904, he was working in the mill and had received several offers to play football. [...] One day, his father <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Fielding Yost of Michigan was in his office. [...] Schulz ran down the street and rushed into his father's office, where he was introduced to Yost. [...] His father promptly told him, [...] "Adolph, this is Mr. Yost. [...] You are to play football for him at Michigan. [...] We have made all the arrangements".|$|E
500|$|Before {{reaching}} Cyrus, {{the song}} had {{been rejected by}} several country artists. It was eventually picked up by Peter Chelsom, director of Hannah Montana: The Movie, who gave it to Cyrus to record for the film. Chelsom found what would become [...] "The Climb" [...] while visiting Nashville, Tennessee, during a quest to find eleven new songs for Hannah Montana: The Movie. After hearing Alexander's music, Chelsom asked her to submit songs for consideration. Alexander recorded [...] "It's the Climb" [...] on a CD {{and gave it to}} him. Several weeks later, Chelsom <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> [...] "the song was gonna {{be an integral part of}} the movie". However, he wanted Mabe and Alexander to rework some of the song's content and to change the song from third person to first person. Alexander felt the changes amounted to a [...] "substantial amount of the song" [...] and commented, [...] "For me, when you change something from third person to first person, it can change the whole meaning of a line." [...] She and Mabe [...] "wrestl over taking words out" [...] and how much they could change while maintaining the song's integrity. After a number of drafts, Mabe and Alexander finally created a version they felt was [...] "perfect for the movie".|$|E
50|$|Salko refuses Marshall {{any further}} access to J2; he has other {{plans for the}} boy. It’s not long before Lorraine Keaton {{receives}} a <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> her son Jay has been found. But this poor mother is soon {{the victim of a}} terrifying conspiracy when she brings home a boy who looks and sounds like her son, but is in actually fact a clone - J2.|$|R
50|$|Yu and Yosuke {{visit her}} sister at the {{hospital}} and Yu leaves at the train station. Yosuke looks her up in the phone book and <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he wants <b>to</b> play the finished song for her. On the way to meet her, he is stabbed by the man he shooed from the intoxicated woman. Yosuke lies in the street bleeding while Yu waits for him.|$|R

Meanwhile, Sheriff Daniels is arrested {{by one of his}} deputies for questioning by the district attorney over Samuel's death. As Mulder and Scully leave Tennessee, Samuel's ministry closes down, and Mulder sees one last vision of his missing sister before he gets into his car.|$|R

He wanted someone to go up there from here unofficially, to speak to someone in authority and say how the land lay. In reply to questioning, he stated that the people he referred to were the British Army authorities in the North." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, the {{magazine}} National Review described Thompson as pro-choice {{based in part}} on Thompson's statements from 1994 and 1997. After Thompson's office <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he was pro-life, National Review analyzed Thompson's voting record and declared that, [...] "Thompson is an ally of pro-lifers in all the actual fights that come up, but he's not one of them on the core issue. Unless, that is, he has changed his mind, as suggested by his current self-description as a pro-lifer." ...|$|E

50|$|When {{he tells}} Lily his problem, she, against Marshall's advice, {{suggests}} that Ted appeal to Stuart, who gives Ted permission {{without a second}} thought. Ted is excitedly anticipating his romantic evening with Robin, when Claudia <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the wedding has been canceled. Apparently the issue of Ted's date led to a huge argument and the couple broke up. Concerned about their friend {{and not wanting to}} disappoint Robin, who is really looking forward to the wedding, Marshall and Ted go to talk to Stuart and Lily goes to comfort Claudia at MacLaren's.|$|R
50|$|Taufiq {{does not}} see his family for several years while in hiding, and was willing to risk his life just to see Nassrin {{immediately}} after surgery. Despite this, when {{forced to choose between}} exploding the bomb inside Boaz and Abir's safety, he reluctantly chooses to have Walid detonate the bomb. When Nassrin tells Taufiq that she cannot live this life anymore and is taking the kids back to Berlin, Taufiq attempts to talk her out of it. When his mother later <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the kids and her passports were gone, Taufiq is brought to tears.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, {{of course}} I have called, Lucetta," [...] he said. [...] "What does that {{nonsense}} mean? You know I couldn't have helped myself if I had wished--that is, if I had any kindness at all. I've <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I am ready, {{as soon as}} custom will permit, to give you my name in return for your devotion and what you lost by it in thinking too little of yourself and too much of me; {{to say that you}} can fix the day or month, with my full consent, whenever in your opinion it would be seemly: you know more of these things than I." ...|$|E
60|$|On the day but one {{following}} this there came another visit from Mr. Furnival, {{and he was}} for a long time closeted with Sir Peregrine. Matthew Round had, he said, been with him, and had felt himself obliged in the performance of his duty to submit a case to counsel on behalf of his client Joseph Mason. He had not as yet received the written opinion of Sir Richard Leatherham, to whom he had applied; but nevertheless, as he wished to give every possible notice, he had <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> his firm were of opinion that an action must be brought either for forgery or for perjury.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1968 BBC news {{programme}} featuring listeners' {{comments on}} the first broadcast of the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour film, one listener <b>called</b> in <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the Beatles' film was [...] "the biggest waste of money since the Groundnut Scheme." ...|$|R

50|$|The Bears would {{manage to}} score {{one more time}} on a drive that started with 2:07 {{remaining}} in the 3rd quarter. Grossman would complete 3 of 4 passes on the drive, and running back Thomas Jones almost scored on a 7-yard run. After a replay challenge by Carolina, however, the officials reversed the <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Jones had fumbled into the endzone, which {{would have resulted in}} a Carolina touchback. However, a major facemask penalty on Carolina defensive back Marlon McCree would give Chicago a first down at the Carolina 3. From there, fullback Jason McKie would rumble in for a touchdown, making the score 23-21 in favor of the Panthers.|$|R
60|$|Finally {{we found}} {{our way to}} Scotland Yard. There had been {{difficulties}} of procedure {{in regard to the}} warrant. Some delay was inevitable. The magistrate's signature might not be obtained until next morning. If Holmes would call about nine he could go down with Lestrade and see it acted upon. So ended the day, save that near midnight our friend, the sergeant, <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he had seen flickering lights here and there in the windows of the great dark house, but that no one had left it and none had entered. We could but pray for patience and wait for the morrow.|$|E
60|$|When I took my {{leave of}} them, they both pressed {{me so much}} to come and dine before they went away, that I could not refuse. But, as I knew I could not come next day, when I should have a good deal to prepare in the evening, Mr. Micawber {{arranged}} that he would call at Doctor Strong's {{in the course of}} the morning (having a presentiment that the remittance would arrive by that post), and propose the day after, if it would suit me better. Accordingly I was called out of school next forenoon, and found Mr. Micawber in the parlour; who had <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the dinner would take place as proposed. When I asked him if the remittance had come, he pressed my hand and departed.|$|E
50|$|Four {{days before}} the {{anticipated}} date, Vissers and Krott called off their race and were staging a press conference, when the Dutch roads ministry in The Hague <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the race could be organized after all — provided it would never again be scheduled on Queen's Day.|$|E

5000|$|Some of {{the artists}} {{included}} on the compilation went on to major label record deals. Others remained fairly obscure. Windham Hill began long term relationships with some {{of the artists}}. Years later John Gorka recalled these events: [...] "Windham Hill decided to include one of my songs on the first Legacy songwriters compilation. Before it was even released, Will Ackerman <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they would like me to record for them. Land of the Bottom Line came out shortly thereafter...." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "He (Marriott) was {{certainly}} the most talented person I ever worked with. He was like a brother to me and I was devastated when he died.

He's never got the credit he deserves. He {{should be in the}} Rock & Roll Hall of Fame because he was the greatest white soul singer that England ever produced. I'm certain that if you caught the likes of Rod Stewart and Paul Rodgers in a private moment and asked them who was the main man, they would say, Steve Marriott." [...] – Jerry Shirley ...|$|R
50|$|After the show, a sober George {{offers his}} apology to Howard. Brushing that aside, Howard announces {{that he has}} met an old love and in walks Eileen. Howard and Eileen have decided to get engaged and eagerly plan {{to start a family}} right away. Everyone is relieved... and happy. Now that Roz is single, Paul takes the {{opportunity}} to propose to her, and they get engaged again on the spot. Charlotte forgives — or at least forgets — George's infidelity and decides to stay with him instead of Richard. Finally, in a deus ex machina-like plot twist, Capra himself <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he missed the afternoon performance and will instead see the show in the evening, thus allowing George and Charlotte another chance at Hollywood stardom.|$|R

50|$|Bush {{also talked}} about the 2000 {{election}} in detail and mentioned {{that he thought he}} had lost until Karl Rove <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Florida was too close to call. The closeness of the election led to the 36-day legal battle over Florida and its 25 electoral votes. Bush was eventually declared the winner when the Supreme Court stopped a court ordered recount in a controversial 5-4 decision on December 18, 2000. Bush notably did not mention losing the popular vote but did make note of the controversy surrounding the election, including the presence of protesters at his 2001 inauguration.|$|E
50|$|It {{would seem}} {{obvious that the}} General must have died {{sometime}} after arriving at the club {{on the morning of}} 11 November, since he was found later that day. But nobody saw him arrive. He went to the club at some point after visiting Lady Dormer the previous afternoon, but his whereabouts between those two events are unknown. His manservant says the General stayed out overnight, and that a certain Mr Oliver <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the General would spend the night with him. No one knows anything about Oliver, but the elder grandson, Robert Fentiman, says that he had seen him often at a popular Italian restaurant. Robert agrees to watch for Oliver, and Wimsey arranges for detectives to assist him.|$|E

The man who will do it needs $500,000 in cash immediately, which Skyler has stored in a crawl space in the house. Walter also asks Saul to {{anonymously}} warn the DEA that Hank is being targeted. Saul initially refuses but agrees if Gus' name isn't mentioned. Walter rushes home and is perplexed when {{there is not enough}} money; Skyler tells him about the money she gave to Ted. A horrified Walter screams and then suffers a breakdown, laughing maniacally. As Skyler backs away, a crying Marie (Betsy Brandt) <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the DEA have received an anonymous tip that Hank is again a target and they are sending numerous agents to guard him.|$|R
