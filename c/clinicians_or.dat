25|$|This {{abridged}} {{version of the}} K-SADS focuses on mania and is a combination/modification of Geller's WASH-U-KSADS and the 4th revision of the KSADS-P (by Joaquim Puig-Antich and Neal Ryan) Specifically, it assess 21 symptoms related to mania, hypomania, and rapid cycling. Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 suggest no information is available; scores of 1 suggest the symptom is not present at all; scores of 2 suggest the symptom is slightly present; scores of 3 suggest the symptom is mildly severe; scores of 4 suggest the symptom is moderately severe; scores of 5 suggest the symptom is severe; and scores of 6 suggest the symptom is extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive. Trained <b>clinicians</b> <b>or</b> clinical researchers administer the assessment to both {{the child and the}} parent, which each provide their own separate score for each item (P and C), and the total score encompasses the sum of all of the items (S).|$|E
2500|$|The KSADS-P was {{the first}} version of the K-SADS, {{developed}} by Chambers and Puig-Antich in 1978 as a version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia adapted for use with children and adolescents 6–19 years old. This version rephrased the SADS to make the wording of the questionnaire pertain to a younger age group. For example, mania symptoms in children might be manifest differently than in adulthood (e.g., children might have not have the same opportunity to spend money impulsively, nor would they likely have access to credit cards or checking accounts; instead, they might give away all their favorite toys or empty their parent's wallet to gain spending money). [...] The KSADS-P is a structured interview given by trained <b>clinicians</b> <b>or</b> clinical researchers who interview both the child and the parent. This original version assesses symptoms that have occurred in the most current episode (within the week preceding the interview), as well as symptoms that have occurred within the last 12 months. [...] The KSADS-P has many limitations: it does not assess lifetime symptoms and history, does not include many psychiatric diagnoses of interest in childhood (such as autistic spectrum disorders), and does not include diagnosis specific impairment ratings.|$|E

50|$|As {{in other}} aspects of applied ethics, {{different}} approaches {{may be used to}} understand these problems; they may be seen in terms of the rights and duties involved in medical practice, or how to maximise the good through the work <b>clinicians</b> do, <b>or</b> in terms of the virtues needed to flourish as a <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> a patient. Deciding which moral framework to apply brings primary care ethics into contact with meta-ethics and epistemology. There is increasing interest in the empirical study of primary care ethics, often using qualitative research methods, which raises important metaethical and methodological questions about the relationship between facts and values.|$|R
50|$|A {{personal}} health record, or PHR, is a health record where health {{data and information}} related {{to the care of}} a patient is maintained by the patient. This stands in contrast to the more widely used electronic medical record, which is operated by institutions (such as hospitals) and contains data entered by <b>clinicians</b> <b>or</b> billing data to support insurance claims. The intention of a PHR is to provide a complete and accurate summary of an individual's medical history which is accessible online. The health data on a PHR might include patient-reported outcome data, lab results, data from devices such as wireless electronic weighing scales or collected passively from a smartphone.|$|E
50|$|The efferent {{component}} is a multidisciplinary team trained in early resuscitation interventions and advanced life support that rushes to the deteriorating patient’s bedside to prevent respiratory and cardiac arrest {{in order to}} improve the patient’s outcomes. Often called the medical emergency team (MET), rapid response team (RRT), critical care outreach team (CCOT), or rover team, the team responds to calls placed by <b>clinicians</b> <b>or</b> families at the bedside who have detected deterioration. It may also provide proactive outreach to patients at high risk for deterioration. Composition of the teams may vary but often include one critical care attending physician or fellow, at least one nurse, and a respiratory therapist.|$|E

50|$|The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is {{a rating}} scale which a <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> {{researcher}} may use to measure psychiatric {{symptoms such as}} depression, anxiety, hallucinations and unusual behaviour.

The scale {{is one of the}} oldest, most widely used scales to measure psychotic symptoms and was first published in 1962.|$|R
50|$|The American Association of Veterinary <b>Clinicians</b> (<b>or</b> AAVC) is an {{association}} of veterinary clinicians that focuses on teaching and research in Veterinary Sciences. It was formed in 1958 {{by a group of}} clinicians of colleges of veterinary sciences and they assumed responsibility for the development of nomenclature and classification developed by the AVMA. A directory published by the association called Directory of Internships and Residencies is disseminated to students interested in Post Graduate Programs in Veterinary Sciences, including information such as the details of the program, faculty support etc. This program is called the Veterinary Internship Residency matching Program (VIRMP) and is similar to the Physician National Intern and resident matching Program.|$|E
50|$|A rapid {{response}} team (RRT), {{also known as}} a medical emergency team (MET) and high acuity response team (HART), is a team of health care providers that responds to hospitalized patients with early signs of deterioration on non-intensive care units to prevent respiratory or cardiac arrest. The health care providers are trained in early resuscitation interventions and advanced life support and may include a physician, nurse, or respiratory therapist. The RRT, medical emergency team (MET), critical care outreach team (CCOT), and rover team are all different forms of the outgoing component of the {{rapid response}} system. The team responds to calls placed by <b>clinicians</b> <b>or</b> families at the bedside who have detected deterioration. Some teams may also provide care during transport between hospitals, acting as a critical care transport team.|$|E
50|$|The {{first batch}} of 50 medical students, though {{enrolled}} in 1969, had been shifted to different Medical Colleges of Kolkata because the infrastructure was inadequate {{to run the}} MBBS program. The development process was geared up {{to fulfill the requirements}} of a medical education. The next batch of students enrolled in 1970 and remained at Burdwan to complete their MBBS from this brand new medical institution of West Bengal. However, it took eight years for the first batch to complete their MBBS degree. The official first batch therefore became doctors only in 1978. Their MBBS degree was granted by the MCI was included as recognized medical qualification. In the later years many of these batches of students became great <b>clinicians</b> <b>or</b> academicians and gradually became stalwarts in their fields.|$|E
30|$|A {{wealth of}} {{information}} on genomics is rapidly being acquired {{with the potential for}} a major impact on human health. However, these data are scattered through multiple scientific journals, reviews and state-sponsored reports and bulletins. A <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> health professional often has difficulty in accessing and assimilating this information for application in medical and public health practice. More importantly, an inability to assimilate and interpret leads to frustration and avoidance of potentially useful information.|$|R

This may even include fragmentary or non-responses, which Loevinger asserts are still of importance and must be rated as any other response.|$|R
