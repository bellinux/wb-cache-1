5|$|Written by Dennis Spooner, {{this story}} was to be {{concerned}} with a planet where drugs in the food and water are used to control the populace. Punishment would be meted out by temporary withdrawal from the drugs which would <b>cause</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> see monsters all around them. The storyline for the four-part story was commissioned on 31 January 1975 and the full scripts on 4 February 1975.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} are single when injured or who become single, SCI causes {{difficulties}} and insecurities with respect to one's ability to meet new partners and start relationships. In some settings, beauty standards <b>cause</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> view disabled bodies as less attractive, limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners {{of people with disabilities}} like SCI. Furthermore, physical disabilities are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI. The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public. They can increase their social success by using impression management techniques to change how they are perceived and create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes. Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners. Difficulties with mobility and the lack of disabled accessibility of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the ability to meet partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in physical activities, social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1951, Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe watched special {{television}} feeds of games {{in an attempt to}} determine whether it would be a suitable medium for broadcasting hockey games. Television already had its detractors within the NHL, especially in Campbell. In 1952, even though only 10% of Canadians owned a television set, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) began televising games. On November 1, 1952, Hockey Night in Canada was first broadcast on television, with Foster Hewitt calling the action between the Leafs and Bruins at Maple Leaf Gardens. The broadcasts quickly became the highest-rated show on Canadian television. Campbell feared televised hockey would <b>cause</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> stop attending games in person, but Smythe felt the opposite. CBS first broadcast hockey games in the United States in the 1956–57 season as an experiment. Amazed with the initial popularity of the broadcasts, it inaugurated a 21-game package of games the following year. The NHL itself adapted to be viewer-friendly. In 1949, the league mandated that the ice surface be painted white to make the puck easier to see. On January 18, 1958, Willie O'Ree joined the Bruins as an injury call-up for a game in Montreal. In doing so he became the first black player in the NHL.|$|E

5|$|While neo-Keynesians {{integrated}} Keynes's {{ideas with}} neoclassical theory, post-Keynesians went in other directions. Post-Keynesians opposed the neoclassical synthesis and shared a fundamentalist interpretation of Keynes {{that sought to}} develop economic theories without classical elements. The core of post-Keynesian belief is the rejection of three axioms that are central to classical and mainstream Keynesian views: the neutrality of money, gross substitution, and the ergodic axiom. Post-Keynesians not only reject the neutrality {{of money in the}} short-run, they also see money as an important factor in the long-run, a view other Keynesians dropped in the 1970s. Gross substitution implies that goods are interchangeable. Relative price changes <b>cause</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> shift their consumption in proportion to the change. The ergodic axiom asserts that the future of the economy can be predicted based on the past and present market conditions. Without the ergodic assumption, agents are unable to form rational expectations, undermining new classical theory. In a non-ergodic economy, predictions are very hard to make and decision-making is hampered by uncertainty. Partly because of uncertainty, post-Keynesians take a different stance on sticky prices and wages than new Keynesians. They do not see nominal rigidities as an explanation for the failure of markets to clear. They instead think sticky prices and long-term contracts anchor expectations and alleviate uncertainty that hinders efficient markets. Post Keynesian economic policies emphasize the need to reduce uncertainty in the economy including safety nets and price stability. Hyman Minsky applied post-Keynesian notions of uncertainty and instability to a theory of financial crisis where investors increasingly take on debt until their returns can no longer pay the interest on leveraged assets, resulting in a financial crisis. The financial crisis of 2007–2008 brought mainstream attention to Minsky's work.|$|E

They argue that an increase in debt {{will have to be}} paid for with future tax increases, which will <b>cause</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> reduce their consumption and save money to pay for the future tax increase.

25|$|An entirely {{different}} form of perfectionism has arisen {{in response to}} rapid technological change. Some techno-optimists, especially transhumanists, avow a form of perfectionism in which the capacity to determine good and trade off fundamental values, is expressed not by humans but by software, genetic engineering of humans, artificial intelligence. Skeptics assert that rather than perfect goodness, it would be only the appearance of perfect goodness, reinforced by persuasion technology and probably brute force of violent technological escalation, which would <b>cause</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> accept such rulers or rules authored by them.|$|E

25|$|After {{researchers}} provoked {{volunteers to}} disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs {{has found that}} those whose belief in free will had been eroded {{were more likely to}} cheat. In a study conducted by Roy Baumeister, after participants read an article arguing against free will, {{they were more likely to}} lie about their performance on a test where they would be rewarded with cash. Provoking a rejection of free will has also been associated with increased aggression and less helpful behaviour as well as mindless conformity. Disbelief in free will can even <b>cause</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> feel less guilt about transgressions against others.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{disasters}} and man-made hazards can cause severe psychological stress in victims surrounding the event. Emergency management often includes psychiatric emergency services {{designed to help}} victims cope with the situation. The impact of disasters can <b>cause</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> feel shocked, overwhelmed, immobilized, panic-stricken, or confused. Hours, days, months and even years after a disaster, individuals can experience tormenting memories, vivid nightmares, develop apathy, withdrawal, memory lapses, fatigue, loss of appetite, insomnia, depression, irritability, panic attacks, or dysphoria. Due to the typically disorganized and hazardous environment following a disaster, mental health professionals typically assess and treat patients as rapidly as possible. Unless a condition is threatening life of the patient, or others around the patient, other medical and basic survival considerations are managed first. Soon after a disaster clinicians may make themselves available to allow individuals to ventilate to relieve feelings of isolation, helplessness and vulnerability. Dependent upon {{the scale of the}} disaster, many victims may suffer from both chronic or acute post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients suffering severely from this disorder often are admitted to psychiatric hospitals to stabilize the individual.|$|E
25|$|Early {{evidence}} relating tobacco smoking to {{mortality and}} morbidity came from observational studies employing regression analysis. In {{order to reduce}} spurious correlations when analyzing observational data, researchers usually include several variables in their regression models {{in addition to the}} variable of primary interest. For example, suppose we have a regression model in which cigarette smoking is the independent variable of interest, and the dependent variable is lifespan measured in years. Researchers might include socio-economic status as an additional independent variable, to ensure that any observed effect of smoking on lifespan is not due to some effect of education or income. However, it is never possible to include all possible confounding variables in an empirical analysis. For example, a hypothetical gene might increase mortality and also <b>cause</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> smoke more. For this reason, randomized controlled trials are often able to generate more compelling evidence of causal relationships than can be obtained using regression analyses of observational data. When controlled experiments are not feasible, variants of regression analysis such as instrumental variables regression may be used to attempt to estimate causal relationships from observational data.|$|E
50|$|The normalcy bias, or {{normality}} bias, is {{a mental}} state people enter when facing a disaster. It <b>causes</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> underestimate both {{the possibility of}} a disaster and its possible effects, because it <b>causes</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> have a bias to believe that things will always function the way things normally function. This may result in situations where <b>people</b> fail <b>to</b> adequately prepare and, on a larger scale, the failure of governments to include the populace in its disaster preparations.|$|R

Foushee described the est training course, which consisted of four sessions each of 16 hours in duration, as a [...] "philosophical inquiry into {{what it is to}} be human". She asserted that the est training was [...] "no more stressful than taking a philosophy course at a university". In a statement published in the Boston Phoenix, Foushee said: [...] "We do not run a company that's dangerous to people. The est training does not <b>cause</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> faint.

500|$|Most of {{the scenes}} {{featuring}} Schnauz on plasterer's stilts were shot using stuntmen. In the scene where Scully meets Schnauz, a safety cable was attached to Vince to keep him upright on the stilts and was edited out in post-production. Ken Hawryliw created the lobotomy instrument Schnauz used from scratch when he was unsuccessful with his attempts to borrow one from a doctor or hospital. The title of the episode, [...] "Unruhe", is the German word for [...] "unrest" [...] or [...] "anxiety". When Scully talks in German to Schnauz, she says [...] "Ich habe keine Unruhe" [...] (literally [...] "I do not have anxiety"). The episode prominently features the drug scopolamine which can <b>cause</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> quickly become unconscious, and twilight sleep, which is a condition that can render people unconscious following great moments of pain.|$|E
500|$|Descartes' {{argument}} crucially {{depends on}} the premise that what Seth believes to be [...] "clear and distinct" [...] ideas in his mind are necessarily true. Many contemporary philosophers doubt this. For example, Joseph Agassi suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the early 20th century have undermined the idea of privileged access to one's own ideas. Freud claimed that a psychologically-trained observer can understand a person's unconscious motivations better than the person himself does. Duhem has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person's methods of discovery better than that person herself does, while Malinowski has shown that an anthropologist can know a person's customs and habits better than the person whose customs and habits they are. He also asserts that modern psychological experiments that <b>cause</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> see things that are not there provide grounds for rejecting Descartes' argument, because scientists can describe a person's perceptions better than the person herself can.|$|E

In the interview, Garrido denied he had ever harmed Dugard's two daughters. He said their births changed his life and: [...] "they slept in my arms every single night since birth. I never touched them." [...] On August 28, 2009, FBI spokesman Joseph Schadler confirmed that Garrido had indeed left the documents with the agency, as he had claimed, but declined to discuss further details. The document, titled Origin of Schizophrenia Revealed, was eventually released by the FBI. It is about stopping schizophrenics from turning violent and controlling sounds with the human mind.|$|E
500|$|While Campbell feared {{televised}} hockey would <b>cause</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> stop attending {{games in}} person, Smythe felt the opposite. [...] "There'll be {{thousands of people}} seeing hockey as played by the pros for the first time. [...] They'll be sold on it because it's a great game, and they won't be satisfied to stay [...] but {{will turn out to}} the rinks." [...] As an experiment in the 1956–57 season, CBS first broadcast hockey games in the United States. [...] Amazed with the initial popularity of the broadcasts, it inaugurated a 21-game package of games the following year. The NHL itself adapted to become viewer-friendly. [...] In 1949, to make the puck easier to see, the league mandated the ice surface painted white. [...] In 1951, so each team was distinguishable on black and white television, the League required home teams wear colored jerseys, and the road teams wear white. [...] For the same reason, teams painted the centre red line in a checkered pattern to set it apart from the solid blue lines.|$|E
