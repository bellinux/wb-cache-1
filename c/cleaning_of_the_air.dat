50|$|Neti (Sanskrit: नेती netī) is an {{important}} part of Hindu Shatkarma (sometimes known as Shatkriya), the yogic system of body cleansing techniques. It is intended mainly to the <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> passageways in the head. Both the Hatha Yoga Pradipika and other sources usually attribute to Neti many beneficial effects that range from profound physiological ones on the body, mind and personality to even clairvoyance. The two main variants are jala neti (जलनेति) using water and the more advanced sutra neti (सूत्रनेति) using string.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} ability to be driven {{for longer periods of time}} and the use of burning fuel, {{mechanical}} wear in nitro vehicles is generally greater than in electric vehicles. In addition, the increased weight of fuel-powered vehicles generally lead to higher speed collisions, causing greater damage to the collided vehicles, and a greater degree of safety concerns needs to be taken into account. Maintenance such as <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> filter and general chassis cleaning, replacement of worn clutch parts, proper after-run lubrication (necessary for storage) and maintenance of other motor-related items such as glow plug replacement makes for a more frustrating experience for first time RC users. In addition, nitro motors typically require rebuilding or replacement after 2-8 gallons (7-30 liters) of fuel run through them, due to loss of compression, which can be accelerated by poor tuning and overheating. It is also possible to seriously damage the engines by over-revving them with no load or ingestion of dirt into the carburetor. As such, nitro-powered vehicles are by nature expensive to maintain.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{describes}} {{the control system}} for innovative air-conditioning equipment, in particular an air treatment unit. The most important characteristic of the equipment is to be “friend of the environment”, {{in the sense that}} it does not use environmentally aggressive refrigerating fluids. Other main characteristic is associated with the complexity of its control, due to the large number of input and output variables and the necessity to maintain several concurrent processes, ranging from the processes associated with equipment security to processes associated with normal functions, as heating and cooling, including processes associated with the <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> using humidifiers. For the system development, Microsoft Visual C++ was used as code integration platform, enabling merging of results obtained from LabWindows/CVI for virtual instrumentation and generation the application synoptic, with other results obtained from Statemate Magnum (used as a Statecharts based development system). The used control methods rely on Statechart models (which are adequate for modelling of systems controlled by discrete events) using continuous variables associated to some states of the system (needed for some actuators of the equipment). The simulation and validation of the model were major tasks that were taken prior to the implementation of the system.

25|$|The even stricter {{emissions}} standards {{which were}} to be introduced in 1975 {{as part of a}} staggered program <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> proved problematic for kei car manufacturers. This was particularly hard for Daihatsu and Suzuki, which focused on two-stroke engines. Tiny Suzuki was worse off, with the company's entire production consisting of two-stroke kei cars. Daihatsu, though, had both the engineering backing and powerful connections of their large owner, Toyota, to aid them in meeting the new requirements. All manufacturers of kei cars were clamoring for relaxing the dimension conditions, claiming that the emissions standards could not be met with a functional 360-cc engine (though Subaru's SEEC-T-equipped Rex proved it possible). In the end, the Japanese legislature relented, increasing the overall length and width restrictions by 200mm and 100mm, respectively. Engine size was increased to 550cc, taking effect from January 1, 1976. The new standards were announced on 26 August 1975, leaving very little time for manufacturers to update their offerings.|$|R
