40|$|We {{develop and}} study two {{distance}} metrics for area <b>cladograms</b> (leaf-labeled trees where many leaves can {{share the same}} label) : the edge contractand-refine metric and the MAAC distance metric. We demonstrate that in contrast to phylogenies, the contract-and-refine distance between two area <b>cladograms</b> is not identical to the character encoding distance, and the latter is not a metric. We present a polynomial time algorithm to compute the MAAC distance, based on a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the largest common pruned subtree of two area <b>cladograms.</b> We also describe a linear time algorithm to decide if two area <b>cladograms</b> are identical...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —A {{computer}} simulation suggests that, for large <b>cladograms,</b> {{it is impossible}} to intuit by visual examination whether an observed degree of similarity is non-random. Drift may hinder our ability to see that several large area <b>cladograms</b> reflect one underlying sequence of vicariant events. Natural selection, by contrast, may cause area <b>cladograms</b> to resemble one another even if they represent taxa that underwent very different sequences of vicariant events. In other words, drift and selection can both becloud phylogeny. But these hindrances do not prevent phylogenetic inferences altogether, and even apparently minor similarities between apparently dissimilar <b>cladograms</b> can be so highly non-random as to implicate a common sequence of vicariant events. Cladistic biogeography (Nelson and Platnick, 1981; Humphries and Parenti, 1986) rests on the detection of surprising similarity among area <b>cladograms</b> of dif-ferent taxa, though the exact calculation of similarity and judgment of what is sur...|$|R

40|$|In vicariance biogeography, {{widespread}} or sympatric taxa can {{be dealt}} with under assumptions 0, 1 and 2. Data from cladogenetic relationships among taxa of a monophyletic group and their distribution over areas are assumed, in the order 0 1 2, to represent decreasing information about vicariance events. A less strict assumption carries a larger solution set, i. e. the number of possible area <b>cladograms</b> increases with the decrease in strictness of the assumption applied. We formulate two requirements for obtaining valid general area <b>cladograms</b> from data of several monophyletic groups of taxa. First, the assumptions, and with them the sets of area <b>cladograms</b> derived under these assumptions, should be inclusive. Second, sets of single group area <b>cladograms</b> should be compared for different monophyletic groups under a single assumption. When these two requirements are met, area <b>cladograms</b> become consistent with respect to the processes (vicariance, extinction, and dispersal) that are a pri [...] ...|$|R

40|$|As {{we argued}} earlier, for the valid {{derivation}} of general area <b>cladograms</b> in vicariance biogeography, two requirements should be met. First, sets of areas <b>cladograms</b> derived under assumptions zero, 1 and 2, should be inclusive (requirement I). Second, general area <b>cladograms</b> {{should be based}} on area <b>cladograms,</b> for different monophyletic groups, derived under the same assumption (requirement II). We now asses for their actual implementation of assumptions A 0, A 1, and A 2 and for {{the extent to which they}} meet requirements I and II, the following methods (and correlated computer programs) : Component Compatibility Analysis (CAFCA), Brooks Parsimony Analysis (PAUP), Component Analysis (Component 1. 5), Reconciled Tree Analysis (Component 2. 0) and Three Area Statement Analysis (TAS).

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} {{computational}} phylogenetics is {{to assemble a}} branching diagram or tree that represents a hypothesis regarding the evolutionary relationships of an entity set. Phyletic trees and <b>cladograms</b> are well-known methods for expressing phyletic relationships. Although many estimating methods for <b>cladograms</b> have been proposed, {{few studies have examined}} automatic estimation of phyletic trees because, in our opinion, most biological entities do not have birth year information. On the other hand, targets in cultural phylogenetics may have birth year information. Therefore, we propose a method to estimate phyletic trees for cultural phylogenetics using estimated <b>cladograms</b> and birth order information. First, we define necessary conditions for estimating phyletic trees from <b>cladograms</b> and birth order. We then propose an algorithm for estimating phyletic trees that satisfy these conditions. We demonstrate that the phyletic trees estimated by the proposed algorithm satisfy the defined conditions. Our experimental results show that the proposed estimation method obtained approximately 70 % estimation accuracy for some targets...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} use of genetic algorithms (GA's) to solve problems from cladistics [...] - a technique used by biologists to hypothesize the evolutionary relationships between organisms. Since exhaustive search is not practical in this domain, typical cladistics software packages use heuristic search methods to navigate through the space of possible trees {{in an attempt to}} find one or more "best" solutions. We have developed a system called Gaphyl, which uses the GA approach as a search technique for finding <b>cladograms,</b> and a tree-evaluation metric from a common cladistics software package (Phylip). In initial results, Gaphyl is able to find <b>cladograms</b> comparable to those found by Phylip on a nontrivial problem (23 species with 29 attributes). Furthermore, Gaphyl seems {{to be able to find}} a wider variety of <b>cladograms</b> with the same "best" parsimony as the <b>cladograms</b> found by Phylip. 1 INTRODUCTION The cladistics method is widely used by biologists to reco [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The hyoid {{regions of}} three species of bats {{within the family}} Rhinolophidae were {{dissected}} and compared with similar data of the hyoid region of other families obtained from Griffiths (personal communication). A cladistic analysis was performed using these data to analyze inter-generic relationships within the Rhinolophidae and inter-familial relationships between the families Rhinolophidae, Megadermatidae, Nycteridae, Rhinopomatidae and Emballonuridae. Two possible inter-generic <b>cladograms</b> are most parsimonious. Within the rhinolophids, either Hipposideros diadema or Hipposideros armiger is the most distantly related species depending on which of two characters, loss of the sphincter colli or loss of the omohyoid, has undergone convergent evolution. Both <b>cladograms</b> show a close association between Triaenops persicus and Rhinonycteris aurantius. At the inter-familial level, two most parsimonious <b>cladograms</b> were produced. Emballonurids, nycterids and rhinopomatids are closely united in both <b>cladograms.</b> A question of which of two characters, sternothyroid shift of origin or omohyoid shift of origin, has undergone convergent evolution leaves the relationship between rhinolophids and megadermatids unclear...|$|R

40|$|RECONSTRUCTION OF HOMINID PHYLOGENY ON THE BASIS OF CLADISTIC ANALYSIS. Phylogenetic {{relationships}} among eight hominid taxa (the Australopithecines and Homo) are examined using cladistic techniques. Data on morphological and morphometric characters of fossil hominid crania, mandibles and dentition {{were collected from}} the literature. <b>Cladograms</b> were constructed using the PAUP phylogeny program {{to find the best}} fitting (maximum parsimony) hypotheses. Two equally the most parsimonious <b>cladograms</b> were found. The genus Homo is confirmed to be monophyletic, while Australopithecus is not. Results of this analysis support a close phylogenetic relationship of A. africanus to both Homo and the "robust” Australopithecine clades. Even though the relationships of A. aethiopicus (WT 17000) are ambiguous, the most parsimonious <b>cladograms</b> do not place this species as a sister taxon of both A. boisei and A. robustus...|$|R
