40|$|Abstract. Oval {{bevel gear}} is {{introduced}} {{as a new}} gear transmission type of intersecting axes, in which high-order, denaturing and eccentric one are included. Based on the theory of spatial engagement, spatial spherical coordinate system of the noncircular bevel gearing was developed and a generalized tooth profile equation of noncircular bevel gears was also proposed. The gear profile can be enveloped for the generating movement between <b>conical</b> <b>cutter</b> and oval bevel gear according to the envelope principle of conjugate profiles. Then a new and general parametric design method for oval bevel gear was founded. The classification and gear variability condition of oval bevel gear were discussed. Meanwhile, its pitch curve, addendum and dedendum curve were studied, and the corresponding equations were deduced. A roll check experiment is performed on the prototype workpiece. Then the influences of motor speed and load on transmission ratio were analyzed. Finally, the design method, profile generation method and manufacture method of oval bevel gear were certified as correct by comparing experimental curve of transmission ratio with theoretical one...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines tested {{new designs}} of drag bit cutters with {{sintered}} diamond inserts instead of standard tungsten carbide tips. The bits were tested for orthogonal cutting forces, primary dust generation, and incendivity, {{with a standard}} plumb-bob type <b>conical</b> <b>cutter</b> (600 included tip angle) as the reference. Preliminary wear and impact-failure testing were also done. The results were mixed. Two new designs had forces {{similar to those of}} the reference bit, but one new design had about twice the normal force. This same design had almost twice the specific energy during shallow cutting but generated an equal or slightly lower amount of primary dust than did the reference bit. Incendivity was eliminated for two radial designs. One conical design had ignition only after more than 15 impacts, but the other conical design was incendive. Impact failure occurred, but not so quickly as anticipated. Over 7, 500 impacts on a sandstone face, with a total cutting distance of more than 1, 981. 2 m, only scuffed the leading edge of the sintered diamond cutting face but put hairline cracks in the substrate mounting pad. Additional design and testing are needed to develop an optimum cutter, but prospects look good for this material...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Flank milling {{provides}} an {{efficient way to}} machine turbo-machinery components. However, the trajectory smoothness is seldom considered in the existing tool positioning strat-egies. In this paper, the tool trajectory is smoothed with a constraint on the resulting geometric error for five-axis flank milling. Unlike existing methods, this new method simultaneously con-siders the geometric smoothness and geometric deviation. The geometric smoothness is char-acterized by the strain energy of the cutter axis trajectory surface (SA). The geometric deviation is measured by the signed maximal orthogonal distance between the design surface (SD) and the tool envelope surface (SE). For finish and semi-finish flank millings, smooth tool path optimiza-tions are then modelled as multi-objective programming (MOP) problems. Given a prescribed geometric tolerance, the MOP problems are reformulated as constrained nonlinear programming (NLP) problems. Based on the Taylor expansions of the strain energy and the signed distance on the differential deformation of SA, the constrained NLP problems are solved efficiently by the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. The existence of the optimal solutions is also discussed. The validity of the approach is confirmed by two numerical examples that generate five-axis flank milling tool paths with cylindrical and <b>conical</b> <b>cutters,</b> respectively...|$|R
40|$|The cutting {{efficiency}} in underground excavations {{relies on the}} optimum parameters of the cutting tool and the cutting process. However, the optimization of the cutting tool design and the cutting process is a challenge and requires knowledge about the tool–rock interaction. This paper aims to investigate the tool–rock interaction using a rock cutting mathematical model. The confining pressure was considered in the rock cutting model with <b>conical</b> <b>cutters</b> and the discrete element method was adopted to calculate {{the dynamics of the}} rock breakage of this model. Graded particle assemblies were created, calibrated, and compressed in the horizontal direction with a certain confining pressure. Afterwards, the initiation and propagation of cracks during the rock cutting processes were recorded. A series of small-scale rock cutting tests were also carried out to verify the numerical model. The analysis results demonstrate that: 1) the confining pressure induced larger cutting force than that in the unconfined condition; 2) with increase of the confining pressure, the rock failure mode experienced predominantly brittle to predominantly ductile failure; and 3) there was a critical confining pressure/compressive strength ratio of 0. 53 when the transition of failure mode occurred.

40|$|In milling of {{flexible}} workpieces, like axial-flow compressor impellers with thin-wall blades and deep channels, interference occurrence between workpiece and tool shaft {{is a great}} adverse issue. Even though interference avoidance plays a mandatory role in tool path generation stage, the generated tool path remains just a nominally interference-free one. This challenge is attributed {{to the fact that}} workpiece flexibility and dynamic response cannot be considered in tool path generation stage. This paper presents a strategy in process parameters planning stage, aiming to avoid the interference between tool shaft and flexible workpiece with dynamic response in milling process. The interference problem is formulated as that to evaluate the approaching extent of two surfaces, i. e., the vibrating workpiece and the swept envelope surface generated by the tool undergoing spatial motions. A metric is defined to evaluate quantitatively the approaching extent. Then, a minimax opt imization model is developed, in which the optimization objective is to maximize the metric, so as the interference-free can be guaranteed while constraints require the milling process to be stable and process parameters to fall into preferred intervals in which material removal rate is satisfactory. Finish milling of impeller using a <b>conical</b> <b>cutter</b> governed by a nominally interference-free tool path is numerically simulated to illustrate the dynamics responses of the spatially distributed nodal points on the thin-wall blade and approaching extent of the time-varying vibrating blades to the tool swept envelope surface. Furthermore, the present model results suggest to use an optimal process parameters set in finish milling, as a result improving machining efficiency in addition to ensuring the interference-free requirement. The model results are verified against milling experiments...|$|E
40|$|Paraffin tissue microarrays (PTMAs) {{introduced}} by Kononen et al in 1998 {{have become a}} widely used technique in routine pathology {{and even more so}} in research. Kononen used a tissue puncher/arrayer (Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA) to take paraffin tissue core biopsy specimens (PTCBs) of 0. 6 – 2  mm in diameter from routine paraffin tissue blocks and transfer them to another paraffin block with up to 1000 holes. As pointed out by Mengel et al, however, {{it is not possible to}} use the Kononen/Beecher system to construct PTMAs out of archived PTCBs. To overcome this drawback in the extremely popular Beecher system, the paraffin tissue punch was modified by incorporating a conical 4  mm deep countersink. This countersink was milled with a <b>conical</b> precision <b>cutter</b> that can be bought in an ordinary hardware store (cost <US$ 5). The countersink facilitates the insertion of an archived PTCB into the paraffin tissue punch and enables the construction of PTMAs with previously archived PTCBs using the widely distributed Beecher system. Moreover, this paraffin tissue punch can be used for other systems to create PTMAs, such as the low‐budget systems designed by Vogel...|$|R

During the primary transformation in wood industry, logs are faced with <b>conical</b> rough milling <b>cutters</b> commonly named slabber or canter heads. Chips produced consist of raw materials for pulp paper and particleboard industries. The process efficiency of these industries partly comes from particle size distribution. However, chips formation is greatly dependent on milling conditions and material variability. Numerical simulation of chip fragmentation can allow some useful chip thickness prediction. In this complex situation in wood cutting, the utilization of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is relevant. In this method, solids are modeled with spherical discrete elements linked by cohesive bonds. However the Discrete Element Method requires a previous calibration step with simple mechanical loading. For example the nature and the mechanical properties of the cohesive bonds must be determined. After an analysis of the different mechanical loadings in green wood milling, a complete study of green wood compression is carried out. This experimental study covers the strain rates range of 10 - 3 to 103 s- 1 using a hydraulic compression machine and the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar technique. Wood specimens at different moisture content states are compressed longitudinally. This study enables us to observe the viscoelastic and hygroscopic behaviour of wood. The experimental and qualitative simulation results show that elastic brittle beams are not well adapted to be used in quantitative green wood milling simulations.

Chips produced consist of raw materials for pulp paper and particleboard industries. The process efficiency of these industries partly comes from particle size distribution. However, chips formation is greatly dependent on milling conditions and material variability. Thus, this study aims at better understanding and predicting chips production in wood milling. The different mechanisms of their formation are studied through orthogonal cutting experiments at high cutting speed for beech and Douglas fir. Within these conditions, ejection of free water inside wood can be observed during fragmentation, particularly on beech. As previously seen in quasi-static experiments, chip thickness {{is proportional to the}} nominal cut thickness. Moreover, the grain orientation has a great influence on the cutting mechanisms, so as the nominal cut and the grows rings widths. This chip fragmentation study finally allows the improvement of the cutting conditions in rough milling. In order to optimize machine design as well as cutting geometry, a geometrical model of a generic slabber head is developed. This model allows the study of the effective cutting kinematics, the log-cutting edges interactions and the effective wood grain direction during cutting. This paper describes the great influence of the carriage position on cutting conditions. The results obtained here can be directly used by milling machine manufacturers.
