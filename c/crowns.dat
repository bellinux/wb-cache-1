5|$|King Arthur was {{assigned}} many different arms, {{but from the}} 13th century, he was most commonly given three gold <b>crowns</b> on an azure field (Loomis 1938, 38). In a 1394 manuscript depicting the Nine Worthies, Arthur is shown holding a flag with three gold <b>crowns</b> (Neubecker, 172). The reason for the triple-crown symbol is unknown, but it was associated with other pre-Norman kings, with the seal of Magnus II of Sweden, with the relics of the Three Wise Men in Cologne (which led to the three <b>crowns</b> in the seal of the University of Cologne), and with the grants of Edward I of England to towns which were symbolized by three <b>crowns</b> in the towns' arms. The number of <b>crowns</b> increased to eleven, thirteen and even thirty at times (Brault, 44–46).|$|E
5|$|The three <b>crowns</b> {{have been}} a {{national}} symbol of Sweden for centuries; historians trace {{the use of the}} symbol back to the royal seal of Albrecht of Mecklenburg, and even earlier. The three <b>crowns</b> have been recognized as the official arms of Sweden since the 14th century. The earliest credible attribution of the three <b>crowns</b> is to Magnus Eriksson, who reigned over Norway and Sweden, and in 1330s, bought Scania from Denmark. Written in 1378, Ernst von Kirchberg's Reimchronik depicted Magnus Eriksson with a national banner of dark blue, charged with three <b>crowns,</b> although this banner did not ultimately become the national flag of Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, <b>crown</b> is {{commonly}} used in language related to governance or law enforcement. Terms include <b>Crown</b> ward, <b>Crown</b> land, <b>Crown</b> held property, <b>Crown</b> corporations, <b>Crown</b> copyright, and the <b>Crown</b> can refer to the government's lawyers in courts of law. <b>Crown</b> is used as the general term expressing the legal personality of the executive of government.|$|R

5|$|Casting <b>Crowns</b> is a {{contemporary}} Christian music band from McDonough, Georgia. Consisting of Mark Hall (vocals), Meledee DeVevo (violin), Juan DeVevo (guitars), Hector Cervantes (guitars), Chris Huffman (bass guitar), Megan Garrett (keyboard) and Brian Scoggin (drums), the band has released five studio albums: Casting <b>Crowns</b> (2003), Lifesong (2005), The Altar and the Door (2007), Until the Whole World Hears (2009), and Come to the Well (2011). They have also released four live albums and one holiday album.|$|E
5|$|Casting <b>Crowns</b> is {{the first}} studio album by American Christian rock band Casting <b>Crowns.</b> Produced by Mark A. Miller and Steven Curtis Chapman, the album was {{released}} on October 30, 2003, by Beach Street Records. It incorporates a pop rock and rock sound, with the main instruments used in the album being guitar, keyboard and violin. Casting <b>Crowns</b> received positive reviews from music critics, many of whom praised the album's lyrics and production quality. It was nominated for Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year at the 35th GMA Dove Awards, while its singles were nominated for and received various awards.|$|E
5|$|From these {{theoretical}} risks, derive {{the real}} world complications. Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to peri-implantitis or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no dental enamel on an implant, it does not fail due to cavities like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 9398 percent depending on their clinical use. During initial development of implant retained teeth, all <b>crowns</b> were attached to the teeth with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of <b>crowns</b> on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to {{get caught in the}} gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, there {{does not appear to be}} any additional peri-implantitis in cement-retained <b>crowns</b> compared to screw-retained <b>crowns</b> overall.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the sixteenth century, Spain was split between two realms: Crown of Castile and the smaller Crown of Aragon. The marriage between King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile united the two <b>crowns,</b> and ultimately their grandson Charles would inherit both <b>crowns</b> (as Charles I of Spain, but better known as Charles V, per his regnal number as Holy Roman Emperor). Despite the union, the lands of the two <b>crowns</b> functioned very differently, with disparate laws, ruling priorities, and treatment of Muslims. There were also Muslims living in the Kingdom of Navarre, which was initially independent but was annexed by Castile in 1515. Forced conversion varied in timeline by ruling body: it was enacted by the Crown of Castile in 1500–1502, in Navarre in 1515–1516, and by the Crown of Aragon in 1523–1526.|$|E

5000|$|St. Edward's <b>Crown</b> - {{traditional}} English then British coronation <b>crown.</b> The current St. Edward's <b>Crown</b> {{has been}} used a number of coronations since {{the restoration of the}} monarchy in 1660, but not, in fact the majority. The monarchs <b>crowned</b> with St. Edward's <b>Crown</b> were Charles II (1661), James II (1685), William III (1689), George V (1911), George VI (1937) and Elizabeth II (1953). King Edward VII intended to be <b>crowned</b> with St. Edward's <b>Crown</b> but in the event used instead the lighter Imperial State <b>Crown</b> (St Edward's <b>Crown</b> being judged too heavy for the King to wear soon after his illness).|$|R
5|$|Casting <b>Crowns</b> {{was formed}} in 1999 by Mark Hall (lead vocals), Hector Cervantes (guitar, vocals), Juan DeVevo (guitar, vocals), and Melodee DeVevo (violin, vocals) as a student worship band. The band is {{originally}} from Daytona Beach, Florida but relocated to Eagle's Landing First Baptist Church in McDonough, Georgia in 2001, where they recruited Megan Garrett (piano/vocals), Andy Williams (drums), and Chris Huffman (bass guitar) as members. One of their independent records was discovered by Mark A. Miller, the lead vocalist for country band Sawyer Brown. Although Casting <b>Crowns</b> had not released their independent records with intentions of receiving a record deal, Miller offered the band {{the opportunity to become}} the first artists signed to his record label. The band agreed to join and signed with the as-yet-unnamed record label, an imprint of Provident Label Group, and began work on their debut album. As a group, Casting <b>Crowns</b> was unusual in several ways, such as having seven members, never having toured before, and their producer (Miller) having no history in the Christian music industry. However, Christian singer and songwriter Steven Curtis Chapman was brought in to co-produce the album with Miller, giving the project a greater amount of support in the Christian music industry. Terry Hemmings, Provident Label Group CEO/President and a personal friend of Miller, openly predicted success for Casting <b>Crowns</b> and made them one of his top priorities at the label. While most artists in a similar situation would have received nine months for artist development, Hemmings gave the band four months and sped up the album's release. Casting <b>Crowns</b> was recorded at Glow in the Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee. The album was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E

30|$|Both <b>crown</b> volume {{scorched}} and <b>crown</b> length scorched {{values were}} visually assessed {{based on the}} proportions of the pre-fire <b>crown</b> that were either scorched or consumed (i.e., had pale green, brown, or blackened needles).
