50|$|Of the {{secondary}} or ultra-accelerators the main categories are the thiurams and the dithiocarbamates. In vulcanization of tire compounds {{they are used}} as small addition to sulfenamides to boost the speed and state of cure.They have a very fast vulcanization speed and therefore, next to boosters in tire compounds they are used as main accelerator in EPDM compounds and in latex compounds. EPDM compounds have much less cure sites than natural rubber or SBR, and therefore need a rapid vulcanization system to have sufficient <b>cure</b> <b>speed.</b> Latex is cured at relatively low temperature (100- 120 °C)and therefore need an inherently rapid accelerator.The major thiurams used are TMTD (tetramethylthiuram disulfide) and TETD(tetraethylthiuram disulfide), They are produced by the reaction between dimethylamine or diethylamine and carbon disulfide. The major dithiocarbamates are the zinc salts ZDEC (zinc diethyldithiocarbamate) and ZDBC (zinc dibutyldithiocarbamate).|$|E
40|$|Energy curable inkjet inks are {{susceptible}} to build up of cured material at the nozzle where ink is ejected, which leads to jet deviation and ultimately lost jets.

40|$|The {{fundamentals}} of the photopolymerization process {{are not well}} understood. As a result, issues affecting the <b>cure</b> <b>speed</b> and overall quality of the final product (shape, size, and surface finish) of photopolymerization impose significant limitations on applications that require fast processing and high spatial resolution. To address this issue, microrheology was employed to perform in-situ monitoring of the liquid-to-gel transition during free-radical photopolymerization. Photosensitive acrylate and hydrogel resins were exposed to ultraviolet light, while the Brownian motion of micrometer sized, inert fluorescent tracer particles was tracked via optical videomicroscopy. Statistical analysis of particle motion yielded the rheological properties of the embedding medium {{as a function of}} time and location, thereby relating UV exposure to the progress of polymerization and gelation. The microrheological setup enabled a detailed study of three-dimensional gelation profiles; other experimental parameters that were initially varied include photoinitiator concentration, monomer composition, and light intensity. Significant changes in gelation time were observed with varying UV intensity and UV penetration depth into the sample. In addition, oxygen inhibition was found to significantly impact the <b>cure</b> <b>speed</b> of monomeric resins. The preliminary results were used to test the accuracy of the energy threshold model, which is often used to empirically predict the outcome of photopolymerization reactions. By using lithographic masks to generate well-defined UV illumination patterns with characteristic dimensions of tens of micrometers, it could be shown unambiguously that the diffusion of oxygen, an inhibitor, plays a critical role in the polymerization reaction. The experiments are in excellent agreement with a simple two-step model of oxygen consumption followed by polymerization. The use of high-speed electronic shutters in the UV light path enabled us to control the illumination time of the samples with high precision. Microrheological analysis could be used to reconstruct three-dimensional profiles of partially polymerized samples. Traditional photorheometry is not capable of resolving the evolution of sample rheology with such spatial resolution. In addition, experiments with pulsed illumination were used to quantify the role of dark reactions due to residual free radicals after termination of UV illumination. Ph. D.

INDTRODUCTION The initial development of the no-bake binder concept {{was based on the}} need to provide foundries with a dimensionally accurate binder system that did not require heat to set – thus cutting down on expense and process steps. Over the years, nobake binders have continued to evolve and adapted to changing production, casting quality, and environmental needs.

40|$|Resin-based {{interconnection}} {{materials for}} flip die technologies {{have been widely}} used in manufacturing electronic devices such as flat panel displays and other semiconductor package modules in form of (die) or chip on glass (COG) and (die) or chip on flex (COF) for the last thirty years. Traditionally, these applications used anisotropic conductive film (ACF) which enables lead(Pb) -free assembly, but requires additional handling and laminating steps. The proliferation of flip die technology is evident in many consumer electronic applications such as RFID and mobile phones, where the high throughput rate and lower processing temperature is critical. For many of these emerging applications the traditional anisotropic conductive adhesive (ACA) (mainly ACF) may not be suitable with regard to <b>cure</b> <b>speed</b> and the compatibility with non noble metallization.

40|$|Photopolymerization, {{which uses}} light rather than heat to {{initiate}} polymerization, is a facile technique used to fabricate adhesives, protective coatings, thin films, photo-resists, dental restoratives, and other materials. Epoxide monomers, which are polymerized via cationic photoinitiation, have received less attention in fundamental research {{in comparison to}} free radical polymerized acrylate monomers. The characterization of propagation mechanisms, network structures, and physical properties is yet lacking. This project focused on the reactivity and physical properties of 3, 4 -epoxycyclohexylmethyl- 3, 4 -epoxycyclohexane carboxylate (EEC), and the kinetic and physical effects of chain transfer agents (CTAs) in EEC based formulations were characterized. This characterization was carried out using real-time Raman spectroscopy, real-time infrared spectroscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, simple gel fraction measurements, and atomic force microscopy. The effects of water, organic alcohols, processing conditions (e. g., UV light intensity, humidity, post-illumination curing temperature), and photoinitiation systems were investigated. In general, increasing the concentration of CTAs in a crosslinking epoxide resin increases the rate of polymerization and the overall epoxide conversion level. High CTA levels also correspond to lower glass transition temperatures (Tg) and lower crosslink densities. A post-illumination annealing was critical in obtaining stable physical properties for high Tg epoxide materials. In addition, humidity (water being the most universal contaminant type of CTA) was found to impact the surface properties of an epoxide polymer negatively by reducing the surface hardness. Hybrid acrylate-epoxide systems are much more complex and unpredictable in curing behavior. The use of hydroxy acrylates in hybrid systems allows for grafting between the epoxide and the acrylate domains, via the AM mechanism. Another intricacy of hybrid systems is the initiation system. In order to maximize the conversion of both the epoxide and the acrylate moieties, the free-radical photoinitiator must not hinder the polymerization of the epoxide monomer. Some very efficient free-radical photoinitiators limit the epoxide polymerization by absorbing {{the majority of the}} deep-UV incident photons. Finally, a renewable acrylate oligomer was synthesized to provide a green alternative to petroleum-based oligomers currently used. The oligomer was freely miscible and readily photopolymerized {{with a wide range of}} commercial monomers. The Tg relationship between the commercial monomers and the parent resin followed the Fox equation. The results of this research provide strategies for controlling epoxide kinetics and physical properties in neat and hybrid systems. This information is useful for tailoring resin formulations to specific end-use applications, especially in films, coatings, and adhesives. Hybrid epoxide-acrylate photopolymerization affords the unique opportunity to structure polymer networks in time and to engineer advanced material properties. These hybrid systems are based on formulations that contain both an epoxide moiety, which undergoes cationic ring-opening photopolymerization, and an acrylate moiety, which undergoes free-radical photopolymerization. Through the combination of these two independent reactive systems, hybrid polymers exhibit lower sensitivity to oxygen and moisture and offer advantages such as increased <b>cure</b> <b>speed</b> and improved film-forming properties. The ability to design the polymer network architecture and to tune mechanical properties can be realized through control of the cationic active center propagation reaction relative to the cationic chain transfer reaction. Specifically, grafted polymer networks can be developed through the covalent bonding of the epoxide chains to the acrylate chains via hydroxyl substituents. This work demonstrates the formation of these grafted polymer networks and overviews the physical properties obtained through control of hydroxyl content and hybrid formulation composition...|$|E

A novel biorenewable thermoset based on acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) and methacrylated eugenol (ME) was prepared via free radical polymerization. The chemical compositions of the monomers were investigated using proton {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (1 H NMR) technique. The properties of this resin system were investigated using small amplitude oscillatory shear flow rheology, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and compression testing. Soxhlet extraction was also performed on the cured thermoset to determine the percentage of monomers that are incorporated into the crosslink network. In addition, the gelation time of this resin at different curing temperature was also monitored using a rheometer. The Soxhlet extraction data indicated that more than 95 % of the monomers were incorporated into the crosslink network. Gelation time study showed that this resin system can become a solid within 10 min. This resin system possesses high strength and modulus, and it is thermally stable up to 300 °C. This high biorenewable content resin system possesses good mechanical properties, high thermal stability, and fast <b>curing</b> <b>speed,</b> making it a suitable matrix resin for the pultrusion process and other composite manufacturing processes.
