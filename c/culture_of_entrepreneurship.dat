30|$|The third {{environmental}} incentive in {{our research}} is the cultural-social norms. The high score on cultural-social norms of the USA may explain its membership {{in one of the}} highest clusters <b>of</b> nascent <b>entrepreneurship</b> rate. Moreover, although Slovenia has moderate scores on governmental support and education, its low rate of nascent entrepreneurs may be a result of having one of the lowest scores in cultural and social norms. All of these findings show consistency with the previous researches, which have demonstrated the strong impact <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> on <b>entrepreneurship.</b> Liñán F and Ortega (2015) have analysed panel data of 55 countries and revealed the interactions of cultural values and entrepreneurship. Morales et al. (2015) have also obtained similar findings and emphasized the importance of entrepreneurial cultural values. Furthermore, Wach (2015) has investigated the roles of cultural and social norms on entrepreneurship on the basis of GEM data. His findings state that entrepreneurial culture has motivating impacts on individuals perceptions, which result in a higher <b>entrepreneurship</b> rate.

40|$|The paper {{intends to}} provide a {{contribution}} to explaining the state of a socioeconomic context through an interpretation based on an entrepreneurial perspective. To this aim we consider {{the results of an}} empirical investigation that analyzes, within the entrepreneurial processes, some subjective characteristics of entrepreneurs with reference to a scheme <b>of</b> generation <b>of</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> and the factors that promote or inhibit this dynamic. In particular, three different profiles of entrepreneurs were identified; the prevailing profile is based on family factors. Furthermore, it emerges that the system of policy measures to promote entrepreneurship appears inconsistent with the aimof spreading the <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> firms and <b>entrepreneurship</b> so as to create new entrepreneurship to support local economic development. The results appear to be consistent with recent theories according to which the development of some areas could be supported by reducing business turnover, as well as by encouraging firms to operate in more innovative industries. The conclusion is to apply new entrepreneurship policies, based on entrepreneurs’ subjective characteristics, which are more selective toward entrepreneurs in terms of their probability of reaching success...|$|R
