40|$|Following {{a request}} from the Health and Consumer Protection, Directorate General, European Commission, the Panel on Biological Hazards was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on Microbiological Risk Assessment in feedingstuffs for food-producing animals for both public health and animal health. In accordance with the terms of reference, this report does not consider hazards such as BSE/TSE agents, parasites and virus, or contamination by fungi and mycotoxins. The Panel on Biological Hazards identified Salmonella spp. as the major hazard for microbial contamination of animal feed. Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O 157 : H 7 and Clostridium sp. are other hazards for which feed is regarded a far less important source. In addition, antimicrobial resistant bacteria, or antimicrobial resistance genes can be transmitted via feed. Forage, industrial compound feed, home-grown <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> purchased straight <b>feedingstuff</b> are the four major groups of feeds for EU livestock. The report focuses on industrial compound feed as the feed group with the highest risk for becoming contaminated by Salmonella spp. Oil seed meal and animal derived protein are the major risk feed materials for introducin...|$|R

40|$|A {{reliable}} and cost-effective electrochemical method {{for the detection}} of deoxynivalenol (DON) in <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> cereal-based food samples based on the use of a novel anti-DON Fab-fragment is presented. The analytical system employed. Enzyme-Linked-Immunomagnetic-Electrochemical (ELIME) assay, is based on the use of immunomagnetic beads (IMBs) coupled with eight magnetized screen-printed electrodes (8 -mScPEs) as electrochemical transducers. Using standard solutions of DON, a working range between 100 and 4500 ng/ml was obtained with an EC 50 of 380 ng/ml. The ELIME assay was employed to evaluate the cross-reactivity of the Fab-fragment towards different trichothecenes revealing a good selectivity towards DON over other trichothecenes with exception of 3 -Ac-DON. The sensor was then applied to <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> cereal-based food samples (wheat, breakfast <b>cereal</b> <b>and</b> baby-food) and a wide range of sample treatment procedures was tested. Within-laboratory precision (9 - 24 % repeatability for breakfast <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> 10 - 33 % for baby-food) and recovery data (82 - 110 % for breakfast <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> 97 - 108 % for baby-food) were calculated by analysing blank breakfast <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> baby-foods fortified with DON, demonstrating that the proposed method has the capability for use as a screening assay for DON in such products.

Ten samples of <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> pseudocereals obtained from Slovak mill house and markets were used in this work. A mixture of each <b>cereal</b> <b>and</b> pseudocereal samples with water (10 %[*]w/v) was inoculated after sterilization with coequal number of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, to obtain approximately 5 - 6 [*]log colony form units per gram of suspensions.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master {{thesis is}} to analyse the current trends in production, {{consumption}} <b>and</b> trade in <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> oilseeds. Furthermore, the work seeks to highlight the ever growing importance of these two groups of crop production. It also addresses the issue of declining growth in global agricultural production {{in relation to the}} growing population and the factors that affect the price of agricultural commodities. The entire work is conceived in three main chapters. The first provides a particular theoretical framework and includes definitions, localisation factors and many other basic data. The second chapter focuses on crop production in the world and its trends, paying particular attention to the group of <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> oilseeds. Finally, the last chapter analyzes the world trade in <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> oilseeds. It also examines the factors affecting prices of agricultural commodities and concludes prediction of the future development of the <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> oilseeds sectors...|$|R
