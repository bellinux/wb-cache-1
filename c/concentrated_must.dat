40|$|This paper {{presents}} a spectral normalisation based method for extraction of speech robust features in additive noise. The method has two main goals: 1) The “peaked ” spectral zones, {{where the most}} speech energy is <b>concentrated</b> <b>must</b> be preserved (from clean to noisy speech features) {{as much as possible}} by the feature extraction process. Usually, these spectral regions are the most reliable due to the higher speech energy, and the frequently assumption of independence between speech and noise. 2) The speech regions with less energy need more robustness, since in these regions the noise is more dominant, thus the speech is more corrupted. Usually these speech regions correspond to unvoiced speech where are included nearly half of the consonants. The proposed normalisation will be optimal if the corrupted and the noise process have both white noise characteristics. Optimal normalisation means that the corrupting noise does not change at all the means of the observed vectors of the corrupted process. For Signal to Noise Ratio greater than 5 dB the results show that for stationary white noise, the proposed normalisation process where the noise characteristics are ignored, outperforms the conventional Markov models composition where the noise must be known. Additionally, if the noise is known, a reasonable approximation of the inverted system can easily be obtained by performing noise compensation and still increasing the recogniser performance. 1...|$|E
40|$|A uva Isabel da Serra Gaúcha geralmente não alcança teor de açúcar suficiente para produzir vinho equilibrado e, em determinados casos, para atingir 10 % v/v de álcool, concentração mínima para vinho de mesa estabelecida pela legislação brasileira. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi avaliar o efeito de diferentes produtos utilizados para correção do mosto na composição química do vinho Isabel. O experimento constou de seis tratamentos: testemunha (sem correção), sacarose, açúcar mascavo, mosto concentrado, álcool vínico e glicose de milho. Os vinhos foram elaborados em microvinificações, com seis repetições. As amostras foram avaliadas através das análises clássicas, efetuadas por métodos físico-químicos, e dos elementos minerais por absorção atômica. A sacarose foi o produto mais adequado para a correção do mosto, pois não incorporou componentes estranhos, não alterou a relação álcool em peso/extrato seco reduzido e apresentou elevado rendimento alcoólico. O álcool vínico pode ser utilizado desde que seja um produto genuíno de procedência garantida, preferencialmente obtido de vinho branco. The cv. Isabel {{grown in}} the Serra Gaúcha region in general does not produce a {{balanced}} wine, because it sometimes does not reach, the minimum stablished by Brazilian legislation 10 % v/v of alcohol.

40|$|Of {{the forms}} of {{renewable}} energy available, wind energy {{is at the forefront}} of the European (and Irish) green initiative with wind farms supplying a significant proportion of electrical energy demand. Increasingly, this type of distributed generation (DG) represents a “paradigm shift” towards increased decentralisation of energy supply. However, because of the distances of most DG from urban areas where demand is greatest, there is a loss of efficiency. One possible solution, placing smaller wind energy systems in urban areas, faces significant challenges. However, if a renewable solution to increasing energy demand is to be achieved, energy conversion systems in cities, where populations are <b>concentrated,</b> <b>must</b> be considered. That said, assessing the feasibility of small/micro wind energy systems within the built environment is still a major challenge. These systems are aerodynamically rough and heterogeneous surfaces create complex flows that disrupt the steady-state conditions ideal for the operation of small wind turbines. In particular, a considerable amount of uncertainty is attributable to the lack of understanding concerning how turbulence within urban environments affects turbine productivity. This paper addresses some of these issues by providing an improved understanding of the complexities associated with wind energy prediction. This research used detailed wind observations to model its turbulence characteristics. The data was obtained using a sonic anemometer that measures wind speed along three orthogonal axes to resolve the wind vector at a temporal resolution of 10 Hz. That modelling emphasises the need for practical solutions by optimising standard meteorological observations of mean speeds, and associated standard deviations, to facilitate an improved appreciation of turbulence. The results of the modelling research are incorporated into a practical tool developed in EXCEL, namely the Small Wind Energy Estimation Tool (SWEET). This tool is designed to assist engineers gain an intuitive appreciation of the limitations associated with this form of energy. It is only through an understanding of such limitations that informed decisions can be made which ultimately facilitate more intelligent installations...|$|E
40|$|The Witwatersrand basin {{is unique}} {{in terms of its}} mineral wealth. The gold in the Witwatersrand basin is mainly {{concentrated}} in the placers and two types of unconformities are associated with the placer formation. This paper attempts to quantitatively describe the origin and depositional process of placers within the context of basin analysis, geohistory and sequences stratigraphic framework. Several tectonic models have been proposed for the evolution of the Witwater~rand basin and it seems as if a cratonic foreland basin accounts for many of the observed features observed the Central Rand Group basin. The tectonic subsidence curve generated for the Witwatersrand Basin clearly implies foreland basin response which was superimposed an older, deep seated extensional basin. These compressive tectonics can be superimposed on extensional basins, where the shift from extensional to compressional tectonics lead to inversion processes. The critical issues about the Witwatersrand basin which were addresed in this review, is the validity of basin wide correlation of placer unconformuties and whether sequence stratigraphy is applicable to fluvial systems of the Witwatersrand sequence. It is believed that the Central Rand Group was deposited as alluvial - fan deltas by fluvially dominated, braidplain systems with minor marine interaction which had a considerable impact on the preservation of economically viable placers. Most important to the exploration geologist is the recognition of stacking patterns of the fluvial strata to determine change in the rate at which accommodation was created. Identifying sequence boundaries and other relevant surfaces important for identifying these stacking patterns of the sequences, depends entirely on the recognition of a hierarchy of stratal units including beds, bedsets, parasequences, parasequence sets and the surfaces bounding sequences. Placers are closely associated with the development of disconformities and therefore become important to recognise in fluvial strata. If these placers are to become economic, the duration of subaerial exposure of the unconformities that allowed the placers to become reworked and <b>concentrated</b> <b>must</b> be determined. In order to preserve the placer, a sudden marine transgression is necessary to allow for minimal shoreline reworking and to cap the placer to prevent it from being dispersed. The placers in the Witwatersrand basin occur in four major gold-bearing placer zones in the Central Rand Group. Accordingly they can be assigned to four supercycles, which are cyclical and therefore predictive. It is the predictive nature of these rocks and the ability of sequence stratigraphy to enhance this aspect, which is a pre-requisite for an effective exploration tool in the search for new ore bodies or their extension in the Witwatersrand basin. ...|$|E

40|$|Pulsed {{electric}} fields (PEF) is {{a promising}} technology for promoting {{the extraction of}} compounds from grape berries, during skin maceration. PEF promotes the electrically-induced formation of pores in the cell membranes, facilitating the migration of anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins and total phenolics in the juice, in an even more efficient way respect to pectolytic enzymes. The intensity of the treatment affects the final results. PEF processing of crushed grapes showed no effects {{on the behavior of}} alcoholic fermentation, as well as on juice and wine basic quality control parameters, {{with the exception of a}} slight increase of juice pH, which basically disappeared in the final wines. Wines processed by PEF were generally perceived as more colored and full-bodied.

When PEF treatment is carried out after crushingdestemming, the maximum color extraction observed during maceration was achieved immediately after the treatment; this makes PEF technology particularly useful for reducing the processing time, allowing its application in several situations, such as the vinification of low-ripe grapes, grapes affected by molds, or the production of <b>concentrated</b> <b>musts</b> from red grape varieties...|$|R

Fortunately, withholding the anticoagulant and dialysis are freqnently effective treatments, particularly with rivaroxaban and dabigatran.
