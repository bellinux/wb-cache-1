40|$|Reconstructive surgery after {{trauma of}} the head and neck is a wide field in ENT surgery. The repair of bony defects often {{requires}} implantation of engineered prostheses. We present the case of a 48 -year-old male patient who had suffered a major crush injury to his head resulting in a complex bony defect. A <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>designed</b> (CAD/CAM) Titanium implant was used for reconstruction. Direct prefabrication of the individually designed implant led to an excellent coverage of the bony defect and easy adaptation to the defect margins. Results. Treatment plan and surgery as well as implant design and manufacturing were performed in a multidisciplinary team. Skin expander implantation prior to reconstructive surgery ensured a tension-free closure. This team approach led to a satisfactory outcome for this patient.

In this paper, we present an automatic approach to the inverse light source emittance and positioning problem, based on a layered linear / non-linear optimization strategy {{and the introduction of}} a special light source indexing according to the compatibility of each individual luminary position with the desired illumination. Our approach is independent of a partic-ular light transport model and can quickly converge to an appropriate and plausible light configuration that approximates the desired illumination and can handle environments with high occlusion. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{company began}} {{to respond to}} these {{challenges}} during {{the remainder of the}} 1970s and into the early 1980s. Stone & Webster met its clients' reluctance to build by improving engineering and construction efficiencies through the use of <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>design</b> and innovative working agreements with contractors and the building trades unions, as well as by providing services that kept plants operating safely, efficiently, and for a longer time than originally intended.To further survive in this complex business environment, Stone & Webster began to more intensely solicit government and international business, increase its activity in the area of environmental protection and alternative energy production, continue its activity in extending the lives of existing power plants, and develop other areas of diversification as long as they did not distract from the company's core business—engineering. Stone & Webster also began to phase out those parts of the company that were unrelated to its core activities and no longer considered financially viable, such as its securities subsidiary.|$|E

50|$|AMS Euler is {{an upright}} cursive typeface, {{commissioned}} by the American Mathematical Society (AMS) and designed and created by Hermann Zapf {{with the assistance of}} Donald Knuth and his Stanford graduate students. It tries to emulate a mathematician's style of handwriting mathematical entities on a blackboard, which is upright rather than italic. It blends very well with other typefaces made by Hermann Zapf, such as Palatino, Aldus and Melior, but very badly with the default TeX font Computer Modern. All the alphabets were implemented with the <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>design</b> system Metafont developed by Knuth. Zapf designed and drew the Euler alphabets in 1980-81 and provided critique and advice of digital proofs in 1983 and later. The typeface family is copyright by American Mathematical Society, 1983. Euler Metafont development was done by Stanford computer science and/or digital typography students; first Scott Kim, then Carol Twombly and Daniel Mills, and finally David Siegel, all assisted by John Hobby. Siegel finished the Metafont Euler digitization project as his M.S. thesis in 1985.|$|E
50|$|Roy's {{father was}} an {{aeronautical}} engineer working on jet engines, and as a boy {{he was interested in}} invention and science. In 1974, Roy received a degree in physics from Boston University and then got a job as a computer programmer for an insurance company until becoming a sculptor in 1975. The idea for the career direction came from his wife-to-be, Marji, who was at the time an art student at Rhode Island School of Design. His sculptures, which are mainly made from laminated Baltic birch hardwood, are not timepieces but they do include clockwork-like mechanisms such as escapements, suspended weights, counter-weights, and (more recently) constant force springs. They are not electrically powered because an important connection is that the viewer winds the piece by hand. The run time of early models was about 30 minutes, but he has refined the technique to the point that some run up to 40 hours on a single full wind. Many include the moving moiré pattern from co-axial spoked wheels rotating in opposite directions. Roy focuses not only on the motion but also the sound. He has developed escapements that are either nearly silent or that produce the soft clicking of wood on wood. A few incorporate wind chime tubes. In the beginning he hand drew his schematics, but he has gradually migrated to <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>design</b> and animation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For {{researchers}} {{working at}} the boundary between artificial intelligence and engineering design, the notion of “agents ” working in a collaborative manner to assist the design effort is not new. What therefore is the new emerging discipline of “intelligent software agents ” and how do agents in that discipline differ from our contemporary notion of computational design agents? Do the differences, if any, help advance computer-assisted collaborative design? Furthermore, what challenges does the intelligent agent approach pose the <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>design</b> research community? This paper attempts {{to answer these questions}} by briefly reviewing agents research, emphasizing its potential applications in the architecture, engineering and construction industry in general and engineering design in particular. We argue that the agent-based approach provides a useful metaphor for reasoning about design systems, as well as contributing new tools and techniques for facilitating the collaborative design process. Finally, with two examples from construction supply chain provisioning and building design, we demonstrate some of the advantages that an agent-based approach brings to <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>design,</b> and highlight the main challenges posed to the design community by the approach. ...|$|E

Human periosteum cells were cultured using an osteogenic medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with fetal calf serum, Penicillin, Streptomycin and ascorbic acid at 37 àwith 5 % CO 2. Three scaffolds were tested: 3 D-printed HA, 3 D-printed TCP and bovine HA. Cell vitality was assessed by Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) and Propidium Iodide (PI) staining, biocompatibility with LDH, MTT, WST and BrdU tests, and scanning electron microscopy. Data were analyzed with ANOVAs. Results: After 24 h all samples showed viable periosteal cells, mixed with some dead cells for the bovine HA group and very few dead cells for the printed HA and TCP groups. The biocompatibility tests revealed that proliferation on all scaffolds after treatment with eluate was sometimes even higher than controls. Scanning electron microscopy showed that periosteal cells formed layers covering the surfaces of all scaffolds 7 days after seeding. Conclusion: It can be concluded from our data that the tested materials are biocompatible for periosteal cells and thus can be used as scaffolds to augment bone using tissue engineering methods.
