50|$|Since O is 1 {{less than}} M, S is either 8 or 9 {{depending}} on {{whether there is a}} <b>carry</b> <b>in</b> column 4. But if there were a <b>carry</b> <b>in</b> column 4, N would be {{less than or equal to}} O (from column 3). This is impossible since O = 0. Therefore there is no <b>carry</b> <b>in</b> column 3 and S = 9.|$|R
5|$|Charles V of France {{maintained}} {{the terms of}} the treaty of Brétigny but encouraged others in Aquitaine to challenge the authority of the Plantagenets in Aquitaine. The prince, who had suffered a debilitating illness for nearly a decade which often restricted his movement to being <b>carried</b> <b>in</b> a litter, returned to England, where he soon died. John of Gaunt assumed leadership in France with limited success, and peace negotiations over several years were inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Concealed carry: Holders of {{category}} D (exercise of profession) and E (self-defense) license {{may carry}} {{up to two}} firearms ready for immediate use (bullet-in-chamber). The firearms must be <b>carried</b> <b>in</b> concealed manner. The requirement of concealed carry applies also for D holders of restricted firearms (e.g. private security with fully automatic firearms).|$|E
5|$|During the {{funerals}} of Soviet leaders {{there was a}} custom of displaying their decorations on velvet cushions, which were <b>carried</b> <b>in</b> the procession behind the coffin. This task was traditionally given to an escort of senior officers, each carrying a cushion with one decoration on it. However, as Brezhnev had {{more than two hundred}} decorations, several were placed on each cushion. Brezhnev's funeral officer escort ultimately included forty-four persons.|$|E

5|$|During the war, the Army also trained {{animals for}} use in the trenches. Dogs carried messages; horses, mules and dogs were used to lay {{telephone}} and telegraph cables. Carrier pigeons, who transported messages back from the front line, were also <b>carried</b> <b>in</b> tanks so that they could deliver messages during an attack. Over 20,000 pigeons and 370 handlers were used during the war, and at times, they were the sole means of communication.|$|E
5|$|Experimental robots {{have had}} the same inspiration, in {{particular}} when heavy loads are needed to be <b>carried</b> <b>in</b> tight areas involving turns and curves. In biology, some authors have advocated millipedes as model organisms for the study of arthropod physiology and the developmental processes controlling the number and shape of body segments.|$|E

5|$|Neither {{of these}} routes was {{suitable}} for heavy freight. Lighter cargoes were <b>carried</b> <b>in</b> York boats to Hudson Bay or in canoes {{on the border}} route. Both routes required navigation of large and hazardous lakes, shallow and rapid-strewn rivers, and swampy creeks and bogs, connected by numerous portages where both cargo and watercraft had to be carried on men's backs.|$|E
5|$|Suit {{inflation}} gas may be <b>carried</b> <b>in</b> a small independent cylinder. Sometimes argon is {{used for}} superior insulation properties. This must be clearly labelled and may {{also need to be}} colour coded to avoid inadvertent use as a breathing gas, which could be fatal as argon is an asphyxiant.|$|E
5|$|The red {{imported}} {{fire ant}} {{was first introduced}} into the United States via the Port of Mobile. Sometime in the late 1930s they came ashore off cargo ships arriving from South America.

5000|$|The {{remainder}} of Okoye's career {{was marked by}} a nagging knee injury, one which limited him to 805 yards and a 3.3 yard average per <b>carry</b> <b>in</b> 1990. Though his 1991 performance (1,031 yards, 4.6 yards per carry) earned him his second Pro Bowl appearance, Okoye's <b>carries</b> <b>in</b> 1992 were largely limited to goal-line situations.|$|R

5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} often {{travels with}} small mixed flocks in winter.

5|$|Two of {{the more}} unusual {{relationships}} are those between certain anemones (such as Adamsia, Calliactis and Neoaiptasia) and hermit crabs or snails, and Bundeopsis or Triactis anemones and Lybia boxing crabs.

5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm {{have been recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} the lining of the gizzard. Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, is borne in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host, while the thorny headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is <b>carried</b> <b>in</b> crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.|$|E
5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} came the augers and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the gravel and dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were <b>carried</b> <b>in</b> 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E

Here the three divisions concentrated, with their supplies <b>carried</b> <b>in</b> massed horse-drawn transport and on long camel trains, clogging the roads. The divisions carried one iron ration and two days' special emergency rations per man, and 21 pounds (9.5kg) of grain per horse, all carried on the horse, with an additional day's grain per horse carried on the first line transport limbered wagons.|$|E
