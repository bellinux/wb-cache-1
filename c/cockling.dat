25|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, {{employment}} agencies were quasi-legal entities in international law. The International Labour Organisation in many Conventions called on member states to abolish them. However, the UK never signed up. The major piece of legislation which regulates agency practices is the Employment Agencies Act 1973, though it was slimmed considerably by the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. This abolished licences, so agencies operate without governmental oversight, except for a small inspectorate and occasional court cases. After the 2004 Morecambe Bay <b>cockling</b> disaster, Parliament enacted the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004, requiring agencies (gangmasters) in the agricultural, shellfish and food packing sectors to be licensed.|$|E

It {{was introduced in the}} wake of the 2004 Morecambe Bay <b>cockling</b> disaster. It requires all agencies (commonly known as [...] "gangmasters") which provide labour in the agricultural, shell fishing and food packaging sectors to operate under a licence. The Gangmasters Licensing Authority issues these (currently there are 1,159 licences) and it oversees and enforces standards requiring employees to be treated fairly.|$|E

5000|$|North Gower {{is famous}} for <b>cockles.</b> Families from the villages of Crofty and Penclawdd have been working the <b>cockle</b> beds of the Burry Inlet for generations. The cooked <b>cockles</b> are then sold in Swansea and {{are one of the}} specialities of Swansea Market <b>Cockles</b> are removed from the sand when the beds are exposed at low tide. The <b>cockle</b> gatherers follow the {{receding}} tide and, while the mud is covered by a very shallow layer of water, they gather the <b>cockles</b> by hand, raking them out of the sand assisted by a [...] "scrape". This is a curved metal blade with a handle. This is used for breaking the surface of the sand. The work is done in all weathers, with starts as early as 3am in the summer. Originally, the <b>cockles</b> were collected by a donkey pulling a flat cart, this was replaced by pony and flat cart, and nowadays a Land Rover is used. Gathering <b>cockles</b> is regulated by [...] "The Burry Inlet <b>Cockle</b> Fishery Order, 1965". Two grades of <b>cockles</b> are gathered: [...] "boiling" [...] <b>cockles</b> are smaller and cooked locally before being taken to market; [...] "shell" [...] <b>cockles</b> are larger and obtained by more intensive sieving, using larger-meshed sieves on the <b>cockle</b> beds. <b>Cockles</b> need to be thoroughly washed clean, and cooked, so it is best to buy them from a <b>cockle</b> producer. Fresh <b>cockles</b> should be soaked in a bowl of lightly salted water for 24 hours so that they clean themselves naturally. A spoonful of wholemeal flour or oatmeal in the water assists the purging process. Traditionally, <b>cockles</b> formed part of a breakfast with Welsh bacon and eggs. However, as the <b>cockle</b> is a small clam, it can be adapted {{to a wide range of}} cooking styles from Mediterranean to American, and they make a particularly good chowder. Every year Swansea holds a <b>Cockle</b> Festival at the end of September, and local chefs demonstrate a wide range of dishes, using fresh Penclawdd <b>cockles.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Barrow {{was also}} the home of soft-drink company Marsh's, which {{produced}} a distinctive sarsaparilla flavoured fizzy drink known as Sass. Marsh's was purchased by Purity Soft Drinks of Birmingham in 1993, and the company stopped producing Sass in 1999. Remaining bottles have subsequently sold for high prices as a collector's item. A new product, labelled [...] "Barrow Sass", was launched in 2014 {{in a bid to}} replicate traditional Sass. The coasts around Barrow have rich cockle beds from which cockles have traditionally been gathered, although numbers have been low following intensive gathering during the early 2000s, in the run up to the 2004 Morecambe Bay <b>cockling</b> disaster. One of England's few remaining Oyster farms can also be found located in the Biggar area of Walney. Traditional Cumberland sausages are less associated with Barrow itself than the rest of Cumbria, but are readily available from the surrounding rural area. Cumbria has produced a number of famed dishes and is home to countless Michelin Guide restaurants, one of which is located in Dalton.|$|E
2500|$|The Agency Workers Regulations 2010 provide workers some {{protection}} against less favourable treatment when they work through an employment agency. However, {{the right to}} equal treatment is limited to [...] "basic working conditions", which is defined as pay and their working time, unless the common law, or general EU law principles are applicable. But an agency worker may, unlike part-time or fixed-term employees, appeal to a hypothetical comparator. This left uncertain the position of agency workers protection by the job security, child care and other rights for employees in ERA 1996. While the dominant view, after the UK Supreme Court decision in Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher, is that an agency worker will always qualify as an employee against both the agency and end-user when they work for a wage, the English Court of Appeal had previously issued conflicting judgments on whether an agency worker should have an unfair dismissal claim against the end-employer, the agency, or both or neither. Reflecting their vulnerable position, the regulation of agency work goes beyond anti-discrimination rights, to place a set of duties on employment agents' operations and conduct. Found in the Employment Agencies Act 1973 and the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003 agencies are generally prohibited from charging fees to prospective workers. Various other duties include being honest in their job advertising, keeping all information on jobseekers confidential and complying with all employment laws. Originally agencies had to have licenses, and under the oversight of the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate, they risked losing their licenses if found to be acting {{in violation of the}} law. The Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 removed the licensing requirement, but this was partially reinstated for agencies in agricultural, shellfish and packing sectors through the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004. In response to the 2004 Morecambe Bay <b>cockling</b> disaster this established another specific regulator, the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, to enforce employment law in those areas.|$|E

6000|$|Our {{first day}} in a tropic harbour was spent {{in what might be}} taken at moments for a dream, did not shells and flowers remain to bear witness to its reality. It was on Friday morning, December 17th, that we first sighted the New World; a rounded hill some fifteen hundred feet high, which was the end of Virgin Gorda. That {{resolved}} itself, as we ran on, into a cluster of long, low islands; St. John's appearing next on the horizon, then Tortola, and last of all St. Thomas's; all pink and purple in the sun, and warm-gray in the shadow, which again became, as we neared them one after the other, richest green, of scrub and down, with bright yellow and rusty rocks, plainly lava, in low cliffs along the shore. The upper outline of the hills reminded me, with its multitudinous little coves and dry gullies, of the Vivarais or Auvergne Hills; and still more of the sketches of the Chinese Tea-mountains in Fortune's book. [...] Their water-line has been exposed, evidently for many ages, to the gnawing of the sea at the present level. Everywhere the lava cliffs are freshly broken, toppling down in dust and boulders, and leaving detached stacks and skerries, like that called the 'Indians,' from its supposed likeness to a group of red-brown savages afloat in a canoe. But, as far as I could see, there has been no upheaval since the land took its present shape. There is no trace of raised beaches, or of the terraces which would have inevitably been formed by upheaval on the soft sides of the lava hills. The numberless deep channels which part the isles and islets would rather mark depression still going on. Most beautiful meanwhile are the winding channels of blue water, like land-locked lakes, which part the Virgins from each other; and beautiful the white triangular sails of the canoe-rigged craft, which beat up and down them through strong currents and <b>cockling</b> seas. The clear air, the still soft outlines, the rich and yet delicate colouring, stir up a sense of purity and freshness, and peace and cheerfulness, such as is stirred up by certain views of the Mediterranean and its shores; only broken by one ghastly sight--the lonely mast of the ill-fated Rhone, standing up still where she sank with all her crew, in the hurricane of 1867.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{influence}} of parasites on the community ecology of free-living organisms is an emerging theme in ecology. The <b>cockle</b> Austrovenus stutchburyi is an abundant mollusc inhabiting the sheltered shores of New Zealand. This species, which lives just few centimetres under the surface, {{plays a key role}} for many benthic invertebrate species, because in these habitats the <b>cockle</b> shell is the only available hard surface where invertebrates can establish. However, the behaviour of this <b>cockle</b> can be altered locally by a parasite, the trematode Curtuteria australis. Indeed, heavily infected <b>cockles</b> are unable to bury perfectly and typically lie entirely exposed at the surface of the mud. In this study, we investigated the ecological consequences of this behavioural alteration for two invertebrates species commonly associated with <b>cockles,</b> the anemone Anthopleura aureoradiata and the limpet Notoacmea helmsi. A field study first demonstrated that in both infected and non-infected populations of <b>cockles,</b> there was a negative relationship between the number of anemones and limpets found on <b>cockles.</b> In the laboratory, we showed that predation of limpets by anemones is possible when they share the same <b>cockle</b> shell. In a heavily infected population of <b>cockles,</b> limpets were significantly more frequent and more abundant on <b>cockles</b> manipulated by C. australis than on <b>cockles</b> with a normal behaviour. A colonization test conducted in natural conditions demonstrated that the predominance of limpets on manipulated <b>cockles</b> results from a direct habitat preference. Conversely, anemones were significantly less frequent and less abundant on manipulated <b>cockles</b> than on <b>cockles</b> manipulated by C. australis. A desiccation test revealed that, relative to limpets, they had a lower resistance to this physical stress.
