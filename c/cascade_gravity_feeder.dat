40|$|We {{obtain the}} {{effective}} gravitational equations on the codimension- 2 and codimension- 1 branes in the <b>cascading</b> <b>gravity</b> model. We then apply our formulation to the cosmological case and obtain the effective Friedmann equations on the codimension- 2 brane, which are generically given {{in terms of}} integro-differential equations. Adopting an approximation for which {{the thickness of the}} codimension- 2 brane is much smaller than the Hubble horizon, we study the Minkowski and de Sitter codimension- 2 brane solutions. Studying the cosmological solutions shows that the cascading model exhibits the features necessary for degravitation of the cosmological constant. We also show that only the branch which does not have the smooth limit to the self-accelerating branch in five-dimensional model {{in the absence of the}} bulk gravity can satisfy the null energy condition as the criterion of the stability. Note that our solutions are obtained in a different setup from that of the original <b>cascading</b> <b>gravity</b> model in the sense that the codimension- 1 brane contains matter fields other than the pure tension.

We show {{that it is possible}} to extend this setup to lower dimensions as well, i. e. there is a self-consistent embedding of a 3 D brane into a 4 D brane, which is itself embedded in a 5 D bulk and so on. This extension fits well into the "vanishing dimensions" framework in which dimensions open up as we increase the length scales. Comment: Journal reference added: Phys. Rev. D 90, 02400...|$|R

One monkey ingested a significantly higher caloric load while receiving the highest density diet. Rates of compensation for dilution following each diet change varied widely, occurring over periods of 3 days to 2 weeks.

40|$|We perform {{experiments}} {{to study the}} inverse <b>cascade</b> regime of <b>gravity</b> wave turbulence {{on the surface of}} a fluid. Surface waves are forced at an intermediate scale corresponding to the gravity-capillary wavelength. In response to this forcing, waves at larger scales are observed. The spectrum of their amplitudes exhibits a frequency-power law at high enough forcing. Both observations are ascribed to the upscale wave action transfers of gravity wave turbulence. The spectrum exponent is close to the value predicted by the weak turbulence theory. The spectrum amplitude is found to scale linearly with the mean injected power.

40|$|We {{develop a}} fully covariant, well-posed 5 D {{effective}} {{action for the}} 6 D <b>cascading</b> <b>gravity</b> brane-world model, and use this to study cosmological solutions. We obtain this effective action through the 6 D decoupling limit, in which an additional scalar degree mode, π, called the brane-bending mode, determines the bulk-brane gravitational interaction. The 5 D action obtained this way inherits from the sixth dimension an extra π self-interaction kinetic term. We compute appropriate boundary terms, to supplement the 5 D action, and hence derive fully covariant junction conditions and the 5 D Einstein field equations. Using these, we derive the cosmological evolution induced on a 3 -brane moving in a static bulk. We study the strong- and weak-coupling regimes analytically in this static ansatz, and perform a complete numerical analysis of our solution. Although the cascading model can generate an accelerating solution in which the π field comes to dominate at late times, {{the presence of a}} critical singularity prevents the π field from dominating entirely. Our results open up the interesting possibility that a more general treatment of degravitation in a time-dependent bulk, or taking into account finite brane-thickness effects, may lead to an accelerating universe without a cosmological constant.

40|$|This report {{represents}} {{a continuation of}} gravity work in the Cascade Mountains of Washington supported by the Division of Geology and Earth Resources since 1974. The purpose of this research has been collection of baseline gravity data for use in geothermal resource evaluation. Results of the Division's gravity studies to date are given in Danes and Phillips (1983 a, 1983 b). One of the problems encountered when analyzing gravity data is distinguishing between {{those parts of the}} data that represent geologic structures of interest, and those that do not. In many cases, the features of interest are relatively small, near-surface features, such as those sought in mineral, petroleum, or geothermal exploration. Gravity anomalies caused by such structures may be distorted or masked by anomalies caused by larger, deeper geologic structures. Gravity anomalies caused by relatively shallow, small geologic structures are termed residual anomalies. Those due to broad, deep-seated features can be described as regional anomalies. The purpose of this report is to describe a Fourier analysis method for separating residual and regional gravity anomalies from a complete Bouguer gravity anomaly field. The technique has been applied to gravity data from the Southern Cascade Mountains, Washington. Residual gravity anomaly maps at a scale of 1 : 250, 000 are presented for various regional wavelength filters, and a power spectrum of the frequency components in the South <b>Cascade</b> <b>gravity</b> data is displayed.

Preliminary results and progress summaries of work carried out from mid- 1980 through the end of 1982 are presented in this report. Only one other summary report dealing with geothermal resource investigations in the state has been published.

40|$|Every {{year the}} saisonal cooling during winter forces a {{gradually}} deepening downward convection {{in the water}} column especially if sea ice formation with brine rejection is involved. Whenever this convection meets the sea bottom in shallow areas horizontal components force the water mass motion, i. e. the relativley dense water masses move along topographic courses offshelf across the shelfbreak and continental slope towards deeper parts of the ocean ('slope convection'). In case of entrainment of bottom sediments the density of the water mass increases and by this the driving force for cascading into the deep ocean. Temperature, salinity as well as the quality of suspended and dissolved matter can give information about the source area and by this starting conditions of the process. High accumulation areas on the continental slope are the integrated results of repeated sediment transport by cascading sediment plumes. Here the information about climate depending intensity of deep water formation and sediment availability on the shelf is stored. The interpretation of the documents needs a realistic understanding of the regional processes involved and their frequency. That is of likewise interest for geologists and oceanographers: Geologists get to know about the influence of marginal water masses on hemipelagic deep sea sediments and paleoclimate. Oceanographers can improve their preinformation for survey and measuring strategies and gain assumptions when modelling the processes of shelf derived deep water formation (gravity plumes with and without sediment). During this 'Poseidon' cruise (124) the ideas and findings of the project A 2 of the special research program (SFB 313) concerning sediment transport from an area north and west of the Bear Island should be tested in an other area, where the probability of <b>cascading</b> <b>gravity</b> plumes is obviously also documented by high accumulation areas on the southern slope of the Norwegian Trough (northern North Sea).

40|$|Sheet 10 of the 1 : 50, 000 {{geological}} {{map series}} of the Geological Institute, Leiden University, is presented accompanied by a survey of structural, stratigraphic and morphologic features. The region includes part of the southern Axial Zone, {{the eastern end of}} the Nogueras Zone and part of the marginal trough adjacent to the south. Formations mapped range in age from Cambro-Ordovician to Pliocene. Detailed lithostratigraphic studies of the Cambro-Ordovician and Devonian rocks enabled correlations to be made with other regions of the Pyrenees. The Hercynian orogeny formed structures of variable shapes and orientation, which, however, have all be ascribed to stress accumulating in a N-S direction causing consecutive deformations. These can, to a certain extent, be correlated with the deformation phases known in other regions of the Axial Zone to the north. A first phase formed the largest folds of an order of 20 km down to less than 1 km wide. The slaty cleavage is generally parallel to the bedding and may possibly be related to this phase, in which case it is to be interpreted as a “concentric cleavage”. Second phase structures, generally characterized by an axial plane crenulation cleavage, indicate further compression. Temporary relief of the main stress after the first and second phases thought to be a result of accelerated strain rates due to folding, gave rise to cross folds and <b>cascade</b> folds. <b>Gravity</b> sliding of unstable structures in Devonian rocks from the Rabassa dome into the Arcabell syncline and Segre area, resulted in thick accumulations of Devonian material in these depressions. Strong deviations from the general E-W strike of first and second phase structures {{in the eastern part of}} the Orri dome and in the Segre unit are attributed to the influence of an inferred infrastructure rise thought to exist below the Orri dome. Epirogenic movements along the northern border of the marginal trough, were particularly important during the Permian and Cretaceous. The Devonian massif of the Monsech de Tost, amidst post-Hercynian deposits in the Nogueras Zone, is interpreted as a Hercynian gravity structure upthrusted during the Pyrenean (Middle Alpine) deformation. The Pedraforca structure is also explained as an upthrusted block. Later Alpine movements during the Neogene formed grabens in the Segre valley...|$|R
