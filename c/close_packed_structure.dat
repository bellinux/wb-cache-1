50|$|This {{is not a}} <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> <b>structure.</b> In this each {{metal atom}} is at the centre of a cube with 8 nearest neighbors, however the 6 atoms at the centres of the {{adjacent}} cubes are only approximately 15% further away so the coordination number can therefore {{be considered to be}} 14 when these are included. Note that if the body centered cubic unit cell is compressed along one 4 fold axis the structure becomes face centred cubic (cubic close packed).|$|E
5000|$|Many metals adopt <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> <b>structures</b> i.e. {{hexagonal}} <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> {{and face}} centred cubic <b>structures</b> (cubic <b>close</b> <b>packed).</b> A simple model for both of these is {{to assume that the}} metal atoms are spherical and are packed together in the most efficient way (<b>close</b> <b>packing</b> or <b>closest</b> <b>packing).</b> In <b>closest</b> <b>packing</b> every atom has 12 equidistant nearest neighbours, and therefore a coordination number of 12. If the <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> <b>structures</b> are considered as being built of layers of spheres then the difference between hexagonal <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> and {{face centred cubic}} is how each layer is positioned relative to others.

5000|$|... α-Aluminium has {{a regular}} cubic <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> <b>structure,</b> fcc, where each {{aluminium}} atom has 12 nearest neighbors, 6 {{in the same}} plane and 3 above and below and the coordination polyhedron is a cuboctahedron. α-Iron has a body centered cubic structure where each iron atom has 8 nearest neighbors situated {{at the corners of}} a cube. The two most common allotropes of carbon have different coordination numbers. In diamond, each carbon atom is at the centre of a regular tetrahedron formed by four other carbon atoms, the coordination number is four, as for methane. Graphite is made of two-dimensional layers in which each carbon is covalently bonded to three other carbons; atoms in other layers are further away and are not nearest neighbours, giving a coordination number of 3.|$|E
50|$|Some metals have {{irregular}} structures. For example, zinc has {{a distorted}} hexagonal <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> <b>structure.</b> Regular {{hexagonal close packing}} of spheres would predict that each atom has 12 nearest neighbours and a triangular orthobicupola (also called an anticuboctahedron or twinned cuboctahedron) coordination polyhedron. In zinc there are only 6 nearest neighbours at 266 pm in the same close packed plane with six other, next-nearest neighbours, equidistant, three {{in each of the}} close packed planes above and below at 291 pm. It is considered to be reasonable to describe the coordination number as 12 rather than 6. Similar considerations {{can be applied to the}} regular body centred cube structure where in addition to the 8 nearest neighbors there 6 more, approximately 15% more distant, and in this case the coordination number is often considered to be 14.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{structure}} of a walnut oil-enriched mayonnaise, characterized by a high content of polyunsatured n- 3 and n- 6 fatty acids. <b>Close</b> <b>packing</b> <b>structure</b> of spherical and uniform oil droplets are observed in the control sample. When walnut oil is added, the droplets are polydisperse and the samples present a less <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> <b>structure.</b> The structure stability increases by increasing the rotation speed. Viscoelastic behaviour of the dressing sauce samples is affected by oil type, rotation speed and storage time. The increase in walnut oil content leads to the diameter dimensions oil droplets increase and consequently viscoelastic properties decrease. For each walnut oil content, the viscoelastic properties increase with increasing of rotational speed. Sensory profiles were affected only by oil type: at higher walnut oil content correspond more intense colour, bitterness, walnut odour and flavour; texture attributes change as a consequence of a different structure. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{position}} of the de Gennes minimum in scattering spectra, where the dynamics of liquids shows down, is given by a hard-sphere expression for a range of mono-atomic liquids that crystallize in a <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> <b>structure.</b> This expression relates {{the position of the}} minimum to the number density of the liquid, without any adjustable or unknown parameters. We argue that this implies that a liquid {{can be viewed as a}} <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> <b>structure</b> of the cages that represent the confinement of atoms by their neighbors. We further show that some metals deviate from this expression, namely those metals that crystallize in a structure that is not close packed. Our expression should prove very useful in identifying what liquids to study in inelastic scattering experiments given that deviations from normal fluid behavior can already be predicted based on the peak position of the static structure factor.

This indicates that size dependent chemical free energy is of concern to form a more stable <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> <b>structure</b> for the tube wall. A partial epitaxial nucleation route by (111) or (200)MTP//lamella layer may also lower the activation energy for the lamellar wall to change into fcc structure.|$|E

Both compounds are Ni 2 In type superstructures with vacancies in the pseudohexagonal network. Additionally, the pseudocubic {{nature of}} the compounds and Ni 2 In type (super) structures, in general, is discussed. Remarkably, {{a large number of}} pseudo-five-fold and pseudo-three-fold axes contribute to generate a pseudocubic symmetry in the crystal structure that is reflected in pseudocubic axial ratios in Ni 2 In type superstructures. We find that they belong to the family of tetrahedrally <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> <b>structures</b> which implies that pseudocubic axial relationships simply are to be expected.

They are biocompatible and can be self-assembled into larger structured materials for additional functionality and potentially better biodistribution, which is still a challenging aspect. Here we investigate the role of the VLPs size and resulting Caspar Klug symmetry in forming clusters out of these building blocks, showing that the onset point for clustering is determined by steric considerations of the binding site and binding agent. The clustering is independent of cargo and the data suggests that rotational symmetry in the T[*]=[*] 3 capsid allows for hexagonal <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> <b>structures,</b> whereas the T[*]=[*] 1 capsid that lacks a six-fold and twofold rotational axis does not show such organization...|$|R
