The fungus Fusarium oxysporum was isolated from wastewater originating from households which contain detergent. The following biochemical parameters were analyzed: pH, redox potential, proteolytic activity, production of carbohydrates, free and total organic acids, proteins and total dry weight biomass. The detergent had influence on the significant decreasing of redox potential, slight increasing of pH and quantity of glucose and total organic acids, while the proteolytic activity was triple insensive in relation to control. The sodium tripolyphosphate had influence on the slight decreasing of pH, significant increasing of redox potential and quantity of glucose and free and total organic acids, whereas the proteolytic activity was intsensive only 5 th and 6 th day.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the vehicle on the release and permeation of fluconazole, a topical antifungal drug dissolved in Jojoba oil was evaluated. Series of Cutina lipogels (Cutina CPA [cetyl palmitate], CBS [mixture of glyceryl stearate, cetearyl <b>alcohol,</b> <b>cetyl</b> palmitate, and cocoglycerides], MD [glyceryl stearate], and GMS [glyceryl monostearate]) in different concentrations as well as gel microemulsion were prepared. In-vitro drug release in Sorensens citrate buffer (pH 5. 5) and permeation through the excised skin of hairless mice, using a modified Franz diffusion cell, were performed. The rheological behavior and the apparent viscosity values for different gel bases were measured before and after storage under freezing conditions at − 4 °C and were taken as measures for stability of network structure. Candida albicans {{was used as a}} model fungus to evaluate the antifungal activity of the best formula achieved. The results of in vitro drug release and its percutaneous absorption showed that the highest values from gel microemulsion were assured. The rheological behavior of the prepared systems showed pseudoplastic (shear-thinning) flow indicating structural breakdown of the existing intermolecular interactions between polymeric chains. Moreover, the stability study revealed no significant difference between viscosity before and after storage for different formulae except for CPA Cutina lipogel (using analysis of variance [ANOVA] test at level of significance. 05). The antifungal activity of fluconazole showed the widest zone of inhibition with gel microemulsion. The gel microemulsion is an excellent vehicle for fluconazole topical drug delivery...|$|R

5000|$|A miniemulsion (also {{known as}} nanoemulsion) {{is a special}} case of emulsion.

50|$|Shampoo {{intended}} for animals may contain insecticides or other medications {{for treatment of}} skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas or mange. These must never be used on humans. While some human shampoos may be harmful when used on animals, any human haircare products that contain active ingredients or drugs (such as zinc in anti-dandruff shampoos) are potentially toxic when ingested by animals. Special {{care must be taken}} not to use those products on pets. Cats are at particular risk due to their instinctive method of grooming their fur with their tongues.Shampoos that are especially designed to be used on pets, commonly dogs and cats, are normally intended {{to do more than just}} clean the pet's coat or skin. Most of these shampoos contain ingredients which act differently and are meant to treat a skin condition or an allergy or to fight against fleas.The main ingredients contained by pet shampoos can be grouped in insecticidals, antiseborrheic, antibacterials, antifungals, emollients, emulsifiers and humectants. Whereas some of these ingredients may be efficient in treating some conditions, pet owners are recommended to use them according to their veterinarian's indications because many of them cannot be used on cats or can harm the pet if it is misused.Generally, insecticidal pet shampoos contain pyrethrin, pyrethroids (such as permethrin and which may not be used on cats) and carbaryl. These ingredients are mostly found in shampoos that are meant to fight against parasite infestations.Antifungal shampoos are used on pets with yeast or ringworm infections. These might contain ingredients such as miconazole, chlorhexidine, providone iodine, ketoconazole or selenium sulfide (which cannot be used on cats).Bacterial infections in pets are sometimes treated with antibacterial shampoos. They commonly contain benzoyl peroxide, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine, triclosan, ethyl lactate, or sulfur.Antipruritic shampoos are intended to provide relief of itching due to conditions such as atopy and other allergies. These usually contain colloidal oatmeal, hydrocortisone, Aloe vera, pramoxine hydrochloride, menthol, diphenhydramine, sulfur or salicylic acid. These ingredients are aimed to reduce the inflammation, cure the condition and ease the symptoms at the same time while providing comfort to the pet.Antiseborrheic shampoos are those especially designed for pets with scales or those with excessive oily coats. These shampoos are made of sulfur, salicylic acid, refined tar (which cannot be used on cats), selenium sulfide (cannot be used on cats) and benzoyl peroxide. All these are meant to treat or prevent seborrhea oleosa, which is a condition characterized by excess oils. Dry scales can be prevented and treated with shampoos that contain sulfur or salicylic acid and which can be used on both cats and dogs.Emollient shampoos are efficient in adding oils to the skin and relieving the symptoms of a dry and itchy skin. They usually contain oils such as almond, corn, cottonseed, coconut, olive, peanut, Persia, safflower, sesame, lanolin, mineral or paraffin oil. The emollient shampoos are typically used with emulsifiers as they help distributing the emollients. These include ingredients such as <b>cetyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> laureth-5, lecithin, PEG-4 dilaurate, stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, carboxylic acid, lactic acid, urea, sodium lactate, propylene glycol, glycerin, or polyvinylpyrrolidone.Although some of the pet shampoos are highly effective, some others may be less effective for some condition than another. Yet, although natural pet shampoos exist, it has been brought to attention that some of these might cause irritation to the skin of the pet. Natural ingredients that might be potential allergens for some pets include eucalyptus, lemon or orange extracts and tea tree oil. On the contrary, oatmeal appears to be one of the most widely skin-tolerated ingredients that is found in pet shampoos.Most ingredients found in a shampoo meant to be used on animals are safe for the pet as there is a high likelihood that the pets will lick their coats, especially in the case of cats.Pet shampoos which include fragrances, deodorants or colors may harm the skin of the pet by causing inflammations or irritation. Shampoos that do not contain any unnatural additives are known as hypoallergenic shampoos and are increasing in popularity.|$|E

Solubilisation experiments {{revealed that the}} mismatch between the C 10 -tail of n-decanol with the DHAB-tails {{does not affect the}} structural integrity of the vesicles. On the contrary, upon increasing amounts of <b>cetyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> of which the tail matches in size with the DHAB-tails, breakdown of the vesicles is promoted, whereas complete solubilisation is strongly hampered. The system is further investigated by DSC and cryo-EM experiments. In addition, the effects of n-decanol and <b>cetyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> embedded into DHAB bilayers on the vesicular rate constants for the decarboxylation of 6 -nitrobenzisoxazole- 3 -carboxylate (6 -NBIC) suggest that both alcohols affect the structure of the Stern region in an equal manner, leading to a decrease in the catalysis.

Plasma indomethacin concentrations and other pharmacokinetic parameters obtained were statistically analyzed. The SEM images revealed the spherical shape of fat microspheres, and more than 98. 0 % of the isolated microspheres were in the size range 12 – 32 [*]μm.
