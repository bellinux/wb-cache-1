40|$|Abstract. Power {{capacitor}} {{is one of}} the key equipments of the high-voltage {{direct current}} (HVDC) transmission system. It is also the main noise source difficult to control. Presently in the world, there are none explicit requirement and regulation on the evaluation and measurement of the noise generated by the power capacitor, which has seriously restricted the development of the further research on the noise control in power capacitor. So the research on the noise measurement method and technology has extremely important significance in scientifically evaluating the noise of power capacitor. Power capacitor in HVDC Converter Station under practical conditions has apparent fundamental frequency and rich harmonic frequency components. In order to simulate this condition, a whole condition loaded bridge circuit of noise measurement on power capacitor has been designed and studied. Two arms of the bridge are used to load fundamental frequency and a parallel resonance <b>compensation</b> <b>inductance</b> is used to reduce the fundamental current, while the other two arms are used to load harmonic frequency. The harmonic frequency load power supply composed of harmonic signal generator and power amplifier which can simultaneously load any combination of harmonics under 48 th to simulate the various actual working conditions. The tests indicated that the noise spectrum measured under the designed circuit completely accorded with the one in HVDC Converter Station...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Capacitor {{parasitic}} inductance often {{limits the}} high-frequency performance of Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) lters in both common- and differential-mode ltering domains. However, these limitations {{can be overcome}} {{through the use of}} specially-coupled magnetic windings that effectively nullify the capacitor parasitic inductance. This document explores the use of a single coupled magnetic winding to provide <b>inductance</b> <b>compensation</b> for multiple capacitors (e. g. both differential- and common-mode capacitors) simultaneously, reducing the number of coils previously required. The substantial advantages of this method are illustrated both in a proof-of-concept test circuit and in an improved version of an existing EMI lter. The coupling between multiple <b>inductance</b> <b>compensation</b> windings in a single lter enclosure is also investigated. I...|$|R

40|$|Active {{vibration}} damping using a shunted inertial actuator is advantageous if external sensors cannot be collocated with the actuators, or these sensors would add {{too much weight}} or cost. When electrodynamic actuators are used, damping can be directly added to the structure where they are attached without the need of electronic integrators or differentiators. Inertial actuators have also the advantage {{that they do not}} need to react relative to a fixed base. In this paper, control with a shunted resistor, current feedback, and induced voltage feedback, with and without <b>inductance</b> <b>compensation,</b> are all investigated in simulations and experiments. Experiments with a lightweight, inertial actuator on a clamped plate show that vibration amplitude is decreased between 6 and 13 dB 13 dB and control bandwidth is doubled when the internal actuator inductance is compensated...|$|R
40|$|The NCP 4304 A/B {{is a full}} {{featured}} controller {{and driver}} tailored to control synchronous rectification circuitry in switch mode power supplies. Due to its versatility, {{it can be used}} in various topologies such as flyback, forward and Half Bridge Resonant LLC. The combination of externally adjustable minimum on and off times helps to fight the ringing induced by the PCB layout and other parasitic elements. Therefore, a reliable and noise less operation of the SR system is insured. The extremely low turn off delay time, high sink current capability of the driver and automatic package parasitic <b>inductance</b> <b>compensation</b> system allow to maximize synchronous rectification MOSFET conduction time that enables further increase of SMPS efficiency. Finally, a wide operating VCC range combined with two versions of driver voltage clamp eases implementation of the SR system in 24 V output applications...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{topology}} of MIMO arrays of inductive antennas exhibiting inherent high crosstalk cancellation capabilities. A single layer PCB is etched into a 3 -channels array of emitting/receiving antennas. Once coupled with another similar 3 -channels emitter/receiver, we measured an Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) {{as high as}} 70 dB from 150 Hz to 150 kHz. Another primitive device made out of copper wires wound around PVC tubes to form a 2 -channels “non-contact slip-ring” exhibited 22 dB to 47 dB of ACRR up to 15 MHz. In this paper we introduce the underlying theoretical model behind the crosstalk suppression capabilities of those so-called “Pie-Chart antennas”: {{an extension of the}} mutual <b>inductance</b> <b>compensation</b> method to higher number of channels using symmetries. We detail the simple iterative building process of those antennas, illustrate it with numerical analysis and evaluate there effectiveness via real experiments on the 3 -channels PCB array and the 2 -channels rotary array up to the limit of our test setup. The Pie Chart design is primarily intended as an alternative solution to costly electronic filters or cumbersome EM shields in wireless AND wired applications, but not exclusively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{pressure}} transmitter using a modified op-amp based network for inductance measurement using a bellow as sensor {{has been proposed}} to measure the pressure and to convert pressure changes in to an electrical current which can be transmitted to a remote indicator. The change in inductance due to change in pressure is measured by an improved modified operational amplifier based network. The proposed network permits offset <b>inductance</b> <b>compensation</b> of sensing coil and also minimizes the stray capacitance between sensing coil and ground using dummy inductor whose value equal to zero level inductance of sensing coil and op-amps with high input impedance. In {{the first part of}} experiment, a modified op-amp based inductance measuring circuit has been simulated using LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench) and studied with test inductance, and in the second part, the experimentation was done by replacing the test inductance with a sensing coil fitted to bellow by means of ferromagnetic wire for the measurement of pressure. It has been observed that the variation in gauge pressure from 0 to 70 psi having linear relationship with output ac voltage in the range of 0 to 85. 0 mV. Corresponding to pressure variations, the ac output voltage further converted into an electric current of 4 to 20 mA for remote indication and control purpose. The investigations have been performed to sense air pressure of pressure tank fitted with pump piston. The experimental results are found to have good linearity of about ± 0. 1 % and resolution.
