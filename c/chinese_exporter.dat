Similarly, others have stated that the undervalued yuan has actually hurt China more {{in the long run}} insofar that the undervalued yuan doesn’t subsidize the <b>Chinese</b> <b>exporter,</b> but subsidizes the American importer.

We show {{that much of the}} correlation between import prices and domestic prices was due to formula biases. Had the IPI been computed using a pure Laspeyres index like the CPI, the IPI would have hardly moved at all. A Laspeyres version of the IPI would have risen 1 percentage point per year faster than the official index. Second we show that Chinese prices did not behave differently from the prices of other importers. Although Chinese prices are substantially lower than the prices of other exporters, they do not exhibit a differential trend. However, we estimate that the typical price per unit quality of a <b>Chinese</b> <b>exporter</b> fell by half between 1992 and 2005. Thus the explosive growth in Chinese exports is attributable to growth in the quality of Chinese exports and the increase in new products being exported by China. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a technique to}} decompose price distributions into contributions from markups and marginal cost. The estimators are then used as a laboratory to measure the relationship between increasing Chinese competition and the components of U. S. import prices. The estimates suggest that the intensifi cation of Chinese exports in the 2000 s corresponded to substantial changes in the distributions of both the markups and marginal cost of U. S. imports. The entry of a <b>Chinese</b> <b>exporter</b> in an industry corresponded to rest-of-world exporters shrinking their markup (lowering prices by up to 30 percent) and increasing their marginal cost (raising prices by up to 50 percent). The fact that marginal cost increased as competition stiffened strongly suggests that the composition of non-Chinese exports shifted toward higher-quality varieties. The estimates also imply a pattern in the acquisition of market share by Chinese exporters: They enter at relatively low cost/quality and then subsequently undertake quality improvements and markup reductions. These results provide some of the fi rst measures of the dual nature of trade's procompetitive effects; exporters respond to tougher competition by simultaneously adjusting both markups and quality...|$|E

S. antidumping investigations. We find that antidumping investigations cause a substantial decrease in the total export volume at the HS- 6 digit product level, and that this trade-dampening effect {{is due to a}} significant {{decrease in the number of}} exporters yet a modest decrease in the export volume per surviving exporter. We also find that the bulk of the decrease in the number of exporters is exerted by less productive exporters, by direct exporters as opposed to trade intermediaries, and by single-product direct exporters as opposed to their multi-product counterparts. Combined with the existing studies on the impacts of antidumping investigations on protected firms, our study helps piece together a complete picture of the impact of antidumping investigations. In the second study of this thesis, using the same China Customs Data, we empirically investigate the effects of U. S. antidumping measures on the export product scope and product mix of <b>Chinese</b> multi-product direct <b>exporters.</b> We find that exporters experiencing antidumping measures would reduce their overall export product scope. Specifically, the affected exporters drop many of the pre-existing export products from their unaffected HS- 2 industries, and diversify some new products into its downstream industries of the affected HS- 2 industry. The overall export value of the new product mix does not change. published_or_final_versionBusinessDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Since China {{introduced}} a new managed floating exchange rate regime in 2005, the persistent appreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar has led Chinese firms to reassess their choice of invoice currency among the dollar and other international alternatives to price their exports. The present paper performs a systematic invoice currency analysis by surveying the published literature, summarizing criteria for decision-making, and evaluating the choices available to <b>Chinese</b> <b>exporters</b> implementing currency invoicing strategies to maximize expected profits. This study finds that the euro could play an increasing role as the invoice currency of Chinese firms, although the US dollar will still play a dominant role. <b>Chinese</b> <b>exporters</b> might shift gradually from the dollar to the euro {{in the face of}} the falling dollar, balancing between the two by necessity.
