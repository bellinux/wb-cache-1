40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{differences}} between the private and public discourses associated with <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs and the identities that are formed by these discourses. Academic literature and memoirs were reviewed to analyze the private discourse created among <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs that form their identities. Media articles and two movies were reviewed to analyze the public discourses that form the larger social identities of <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs. Embracing Fairhurst and Putnam’s (2004) conceptualization of “discourse” as local talk and texts and “Discoruse” as large scale systems of meaning, I conceptualized private discourse as local talk among <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs and public “Discourse” as larger meanings about <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs. Taking a becoming orientation to discourse and embracing a Foucauldian power/knowledge lens, I analyze discourses about <b>and</b> among <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs to explore their emergent identities. This analysis reveals that the public discourse surrounding the identity of <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs is oppressive and potentially limits the ways they can engage in necessary discourse to create their own identities...|$|R
