Many researchers are actively searching for personification of this therapy {{and the reasons for}} delayed <b>consolidation.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> the study – to identify the biomarker for delayed bone consolidation. Materials and Methods. The study groups consisted of patients with high-energy tibia open fractures with normal (group 1) and with delayed (2 nd group) <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> bone <b>fragments.</b> The enzymatic activity of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in blood serum was studied after 7 days and in 1, 3 and 6 months after bone fragments reduction.

40|$|Sweden. The {{demand for}} land {{consolidation}} arises from a similar source in all countries: the need for readjusting unfavourable land division and promoting the appropriate use of the real property without changing the status of ownership. Traditionally land consolidation {{is used for the}} improvement of the land division of farms through the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fragmented</b> parcels. In the late 20 th century land consolidation has formed into a rural development instrument with multi-purpose objectives, which can additionally be used for improving the infrastructure, enhancing landscape and nature protection, and implementing various recreation area projects. There are differences in the objectives and procedures <b>of</b> land <b>consolidation</b> depending on the country in question, as the development of the procedure has been influenced by the historical trends, culture, tradition and legislation in each of the countries.

40|$|The loss of orexin neurons {{in humans}} is {{associated}} with the sleep disorder narcolepsy, which is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. Mice lacking orexin peptides, orexin neurons, or orexin receptors recapitulate human narcolepsy phenotypes, further highlighting a critical role for orexin signaling in the maintenance of wakefulness. Despite the known role of orexin neurons in narcolepsy, the precise neural mechanisms downstream of these neurons remain unknown. We found that targeted restoration of orexin receptor expression in the dorsal raphe (DR) and in the locus coeruleus (LC) of mice lacking orexin receptors inhibited cataplexy-like episodes and pathological fragmentation of wakefulness (i. e., sleepiness), respectively. The suppression of cataplexy-like episodes correlated with the number of serotonergic neurons restored with orexin receptor expression in the DR, while the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fragmented</b> wakefulness correlated with the number of noradrenergic neurons restored in the LC. Furthermore, pharmacogenetic activation of these neurons using designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (DREADD) technology ameliorated narcolepsy in mice lacking orexin neurons. These results suggest that DR serotonergic and LC noradrenergic neurons play differential roles in orexin neuron-dependent regulation of sleep/wakefulness and highlight a pharmacogenetic approach for the amelioration of narcolepsy. © Copyright 2014 American Society for Clinical Investigation...|$|R

In the years 1317-1389 there existed a feudal estate of the Olomouc bishopric.

40|$|Increased {{regulation}} of wireless telephone service is being proposed by both {{federal and state}} policy makers, raising the question of optimal jurisdiction. The case for decentralization (state rules) is strongest when the economic activity being regulated is localized and market spillovers relatively small. Alternatively, the case for uniformity (federal rules) becomes more persuasive when externalities dictate that efficiency in one state is closely tied to efficient arrangements in others. In this situation, balkanization becomes disruptive and federalism becomes ineffective as firms conform not to diverse standards but (in the best case scenario) to the most stringent ones. As an empirical matter, wireless telephony exhibits strong economies of scale and scope, and national networks have proven crucial to industry development. <b>Consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fragmented</b> license areas has, along with new entry, been instrumental in reducing rates by 79 %, 1993 - 2002.

50|$|Gurcharan Das {{comments}} {{that there are}} still sectors of the Indian economy, and thus the Indian development, that need a lot of work. A legacy of the Gandhian peasant farmer ideal, the Indian agricultural sector is woefully unmodernized and hindered by a vast system of regulations and protection. Das believes India needs to shift focus from peasant farming to agribusiness and encourage private capital to move from urban to rural areas. There is also a need to lift onerous distribution controls and allow large retailers to contract directly with farmers. Greater investment in irrigation infrastructure and advanced farming methods will follow from the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fragmented</b> holdings.A peculiar phenomenon of the Indian growth story is that it occurs not without the government, not because of the government, but despite the government. The Indian bureaucratic system continues to remain inefficient, non-transparent and a hindrance to business. Patna, the capital state of Bihar, {{is a prime example of}} where easing regulatory reform and reforming the bureaucratic structure has contributed to economic growth. Largely a result of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's work, Patna is now the second-easiest city in India to start a business with 11 stages in the process, 8 of which are national and common across states. Patna is also the leader in best practices in India in the cost to start a business (38.5% of income per capita), the cost to deal with business-related construction permits (204% of income per capita) and the cost to enforce contracts (16.9% of the claim value). However, these numbers do not hold up too well when compared to global averages. Patna ranks 137th in the world in terms of number of procedures, 124th in terms of costs to start business and 31st in terms of costs to enforce contracts.Das points to electrical utility coverage and reliability, an extremely complicated tax regime that creates incentives for tax evasion, and a woefully inadequate public education system as some of the other areas that require dire attention and much greater investment from the Indian government.|$|R

The tools of Rapid Rural Appraisal were used. 451 farmers' organizations spread over 197 villager's communities were surveyed. The analysis and interpretation of data shows that the agriculture and the environment conservation are dynamic in the Far North region of Cameroon. To integrate and manage the agricultural production strategies, the farmers grouped into the Associations of production, the Common Initiative Groups, the Committees Consultation and Dynamic of professional productors. The strategies are based of the management of the parklands of production, the selection of the agricultural production technics, and the logic of economic exploitation of the agricultural lands. The landscaped parklands in the agricultural plots are composed of nitrogen-fixing species and multiple using such as the Faedherbia (Acacia albida), Gomma Arabica, Acacia senegal, Leucaena Leucocephaa and the species with an higher timber production such as the Eucalyptus camaldulensis, the Azadirachta indica. According our survey, the Faidherbia species however offers the advantage to be easily multiplicited by suckering and dissemination/extension can be done by moving herds. More than 17 650 hectares agricultural land are mainly afforested in which the rainy season crops such as millet, groundnuts, cowpeas are cultivated while in dry season the crops of as Muskwari is performed. The logic of using agricultural land allows optimizing in the dry season some significant economic revenue. The farmers collect at that season the pods of Faedherbia, prune and sell fodder for cattle ranchers and small ruminants (sheep, goats). However, the parklands are not the common property. The financial revenues generated by the sale of pods and fodder are estimated at more than 187 910 francs CFA per year, while sale of firewood mainly the Eucalyptus, Azadirachta indica which produce more than 455, 000 to 650, 000 francs CFA.

Methods : The study was conducted on a total of 129 patients with closed fractures of the diaphysis of the femur and tibia type A and type B. Patients were divided into two groups, based on the applied operating method, static or dynamic intramedullary osteosynthesis. Results: The average number of weeks of healing femoral and tibial fractures was slightly in advantage of static intramedullary osteosynthesis, it was 17. 08 weeks (SD= 3. 382).

40|$|Mergers and {{acquisitions}} and corporate governance are two extensively researched areas in finance. However, these {{areas have been}} studied separately and carried out mainly in developed and mature markets. Therefore, there is limited evidence on the link between mergers {{and acquisitions}} transactions and corporate governance mechanisms. Specifically, empirical evidence based on Chinese settings is comparatively limited. This study integrates and examines mergers and acquisitions incidences and, corporate governance mechanisms using a unique dataset from China. The study uses a unique dataset of Chinese firms involved in merger and acquisition activities between 2002 and 2011. The short-term daily abnormal returns are calculated using cumulative abnormal returns. Given the controversies surrounding long-term returns computation, two alternative methods are used, the buy-and-hold abnormal returns and calendar-time-portfolio returns to calculate bidder returns. Instrumental variables estimation method is used to investigate the relation between bidder returns and corporate governance. In the short-term, this study’s findings suggest that stock prices react instantaneously to ‘new’ information as investors perceive higher potential synergetic gains from the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fragmented</b> firms. Analysis <b>of</b> the factors driving the price changes shows that state and legal-person ownership are associated with low returns. Adding independent directors on corporate boards does not necessarily improve management monitoring. Interestingly, combining the role of CEO and chairperson is associated with high bidder returns due to the socio-political life of Chinese {{which is consistent with}} stewardship theory. In the long-term, the short-term gains are reversed based on actual performance of the resultant firm two years after acquisition. Analysis of the factors driving the price differences shows that ownership structure and independent directors are associated with low bidder returns. The study highlights the need for the state to play a supportive role that helps the market to run on its own and formulate sound corporate governance policies that not only involves compliance but promotes a culture and climate of consistency, responsibility, accountability, fairness, transparency and effectiveness. It also highlights that where the state doubles up as player and regulator, M&A activity may be driven by political and social rather than be economically motivated...|$|R

40|$|The chosen project {{stems from}} the broader context of Maputo as {{waterfront}} city. Increased industrial privatisation of the harbour strip adjacent to the city’s historic Baixa district led to the relocation of public functions, away from the downtown water’s edge and so disconnecting city life from the water. The potential of the city reconnecting to the water is thus latent. The dissertation responds to this potential by reintroducing a public program to the waterfront site. The building integrates with a greater urban vision for the precinct, whereby the industrial waterfront strip is reprogrammed {{with a layer of}} mixed use functions. A water-borne public transport node is the architectural typology to be explored. The architectural study aims to investigate the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> currently <b>fragmented</b> water transport modes in one facility and so promote integration between different users and the public. Exploration also includes investigation of dualities and contrasts. Interaction between formal and informal trade, water and land transport, and international trends versus local influences are explored. The projected growth of the city further necessitates the expansion and improvement of water transport infrastructure. The proposed interchange connects all public water -borne modes of transport in Maputo, additionally establishing the link between the city and the water, and subsequently the downtown area with satellite suburbs around Maputo Bay. The design acknowledges the historic nature of the site and context, and adds an additional layer whilst responding to the richness of the existing in an environmentally sensitive manner. The social context of Maputo as a capital city in a developing country is another important consideration. The informal, public, transient nature of the context informs the design, juxtaposed against a first world, international business and tourism centre. The facility will aid in the reintegration of the waterfront with the city, effectively connecting it to other modes of transport. Dissertation (MArch(Prof)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

This technique is based on distributing all services in the minimum amount of servers. This way, the overall energy consumption of the datacenter is reduced, as less servers are needed to be active. Traditionally, {{research has focused on}} strategies for <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> Virtual Machines (VMs), but containers are changing the landscape of Cloud services. Containers are expected to optimize the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> services by reducing the amount of needed resources, thus allocating more services using less servers. However, while multiple research works have been produced in the Energy Efficiency (EE) achieved through <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> VMs, there is yet no experimental work on how <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers affects EE, when assuming a given Quality-of-Service (QoS) to the user. In this paper we show an experimental analysis on the effects <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers in the QoS and EE, compared to the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> VMs. We demonstrate that the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers is indeed more optimal than the one of VMs, both in terms of QoS and EE. Consecutively, we analyze how the degradation of the service is produced both in QoS and EE, and we show how QoS is the variable which is more affected by consolidation. This work provides the necessary scientific background on <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> two widely used virtualization technologies, and we believe it is useful for future works on the optimization of resources in datacenters...|$|R
