40|$|After the Valley Complex Fire burned 86 000 ha {{in western}} Montana in 2000, two studies were {{conducted}} to determine the effectiveness of contour-felled log, straw wattle, and hand-dug <b>contour</b> <b>trench</b> erosion barriers in mitigating postfire runoff and erosion. Sixteen plots were located across a steep, severely burned slope, with a single barrier installed in 12 plots (four per treatment) and four plots left untreated as controls. In a rainfall-plus-inflow simulation, 26 mm h! 1 rainfall was applied to each plot for 1 h and 48 L min! 1 of overland flow was added for the last 15 min. Total runoff from the contour-felled log (0 Ð 58 mm) and straw wattle (0 Ð 40 mm) plots was significantly less than from the control plots (2 Ð 0 mm), but the <b>contour</b> <b>trench</b> plots (1 Ð 3 mm) showed no difference. The total sediment yield from the straw wattle plots (0 Ð 21 Mg ha! 1) was significantly less than the control plots (2 Ð 2 Mg ha! 1); the sediment yields in the contour-felled log plots (0 Ð 58 Mg ha! 1) and the <b>contour</b> <b>trench</b> plots (2 Ð 5 Mg ha! 1) were not significantly different. After the simulations, sediment fences were installed to trap sediment eroded by natural rainfall. During the subsequent 3 years, sediment yields from individual events increased significantly with increasing 10 min maximum intensity and rainfall amounts. High-intensity rainfall occurred early {{in the study and}} the erosion barriers were filled with sediment. There {{were no significant differences in}} event or annual sediment yields among treated and control plots. In 2001, the overall mean annual sediment yield was 21 Mg ha! 1; this value declined significantly to 0 Ð 6 Mg ha! 1 in 2002 and 0 Ð 2 Mg ha! 1 in 2003.

40|$|The {{disastrous}} {{soil erosion}} {{problems and the}} uncontrolled movement of water in Nepal 2 ̆ 7 s mountains caused by human and livestock activities call for the identification of simple, cheap, and effective rehabilitation techniques. This report analyzes contour trenching as rehabilitation techniques in the United States and examines the applicability and transferability of the techniques to the Nepalese conditions. The details of <b>contour</b> <b>trench</b> systems as applied by the U. S. Forest Service have been analyzed by reviewing available research papers, handbooks, official records, personal communication, and actual field visits. The results and observations have been delineated for the physical and cultural aspects of the Nepalese watershed system. <b>Contour</b> <b>trench</b> systems in the United States are designed to hold overland runoff resulting from a high intensity, short duration rainfall events. The idea is to store overland flow on site {{and allow it to}} percolate slowly into the soil. Trenches are an interim measure and are no substitute for rehabilitation measures designed to reduce runoff and erosion for a prolonged period of time, Quantitative evaluation of trenching effects are lacking. The findings of the few quantitative studies report the combined effects of trenching, grazing and fire control. There are examples of tremendous success and disastrous failures. Contour trenches are delicate structures. Evaluation by experienced personnel reveals that contour trenching has a definite role in the rehabilitation of impaired watersheds if the plan is carried out systematically and precisely. Contour trenches have questionable benefits in areas where large volume, long duration and possibly high intensity rains occur (such as the monsoon areas). Thus, this control method has its limited role in the overall strategy of rehabilitation planning in Nepal. The primary limitation as seen from the analysis is the huge amount of long duration rainfall and direct runoff produced. However, there is some potential for application of contour trenching in the semi-arid parts of Nepal where frequent floodings are caused by short duration, high intensity rainfall. Watershed rehabilitation techniques developed in U. S. can be applied in Nepal in certain cases. However, site specific research support is essential in designing control structures. Nepal needs to develop research projects to identify and apply alternative rehabilitation techniques which can handle large volume of uncontrolled water over the impaired watershed...|$|E

Landscape structures (e.g., log erosion barriers, <b>contour</b> <b>trenches,</b> straw [...] ) trap sediment and prevent slope rilling. Strip tillage and chemicals break up or reduce hydrophobic soils and improve infiltration. Wood and straw mulch reduced erosion rates by 60 to 80%, contour-felled log erosion barriers 50 to 70%, hydromulch 19% and post fire seeding {{had little effect}} the first year when rainfall events were small and intensities low.|$|R

New data for {{a section of the}} watershed were created with satellite image, spatial data, and geoprocessing software including Erdas Imagine 9. 1 and ArcInfo and free information and software in the public domain on the internet. AGWA 2. 0 - SWAT modeling software used the data to assess the actual conditions of the study area (Model 1) including sediment yield, water yield, percolation, and stream flow. Then, two models were created by altering the conditions of the land cover/use grid: Model 2 changed the bare soil class into <b>contour</b> <b>trenches,</b> and Model 3 changed bare soil class into trees or forest. A comparison of Models 2 and 3 with the current state (Model 1) found that forestation, Model 3, would greatly decrease flooding and increase water infiltration...|$|R
40|$|Watersheds A and B, on two {{adjoining}} depleted subalpine watersheds at {{the head}} ofEphraim Canyon, UT, have been under continuous study since 1912. Watershed A has been protected from grazing since 1920. This protection resulted in a rapid increase in plant cover on all but the more de pleted areas. Although Watershed A is still in marginal condition, increase in plant cover has resulted in substan tial reduction in runoffand sedimentation. In Watershed B, heavy grazing reduced ground cover and changed a fairly stable watershed to a serious flood-source area. 1 m, mediate control ofsummer runoffand sedimentation was achieved with disking, <b>contour</b> <b>trenching,</b> and seeding of grasses and leguminous forbs. Watershed B would now support controlled livestock use without producing runoff and erosion. Watershed stabilization can be much more rapidly accomplished using restoration techniques than long periods ofnonuse.

50|$|Pimpari Gavali {{is located}} in the rain-fed zone of Maharashtra state. Rain is the only source of water. Rainwater {{harvesting}} is the accumulation and storage of rainwater for reuse before it reaches the aquifer. The water collected is redirected to a deep pit with percolation. Rainwater harvesting provides water when there is a drought. Rainwater harvesting prevents flooding of low-lying areas. Rain water harvesting replenishes the ground water table, which enables the dug wells and bore wells to yield in a sustained manner. It helps in the availability of clean water by reducing the salinity and the presence of iron salts. Deep continuous <b>contour</b> <b>trenches</b> (CCT) structures are used for the rainwater harvesting, in the hills that cover about 1/4 of the area of the village. The deep CCT, with dimensions of 1 meter wide and deep, are dug across the hills and prevent the direct runoff of the rainwater. The deep CCTs cover 317 hectares.|$|R

It is surrounded by hills and valleys with greenery. The main source of water in the village is rainfall. It experiences heavy rainfall in monsoon season. Due to the stiff slope of hills and soil conditions less water retain and percolate in the soil, this results in scarcity of water starts from November-December months. Rice is the main crop in surrounding area. Education is available up to 10th standard only. No sources of income are available, most of the people migrate to nearby city’s (Pune, Lonavala, and Mumbai) for jobs.

30|$|The {{classification}} of landforms {{on the basis}} of hydrogeomorphic characteristics is further validated with the hydrogeochemistry and subsurface geology. Both the studies validate the hydrogeomorphic {{classification of}} landforms studied through field work and remote sensing techniques. The hydrogeochemistry of denudational landforms reveals that the quality of water is good, but replenishment during monsoon is very small. Hence, these landforms have to be preserved from deterioration and are ideal target for artificial recharge for a better tomorrow in Mumbai Island. Continuous <b>contour</b> <b>trenches</b> (CCT), loose boulder structures (gully plugs) are the most suitable structures for hilly area as these structures will function initially as soil conservation structure and subsequently improve the soil moisture retention and also enhance the recharge to groundwater. These structures will also improve sustainability of springs thereby improving water supply scenario in the small hamlets situated in hilly areas. But fluvial landforms have good potential to hold water and the quality of water is usually good. This landform is the feeder for domestic supply of water to {{the majority of the population}} in the city and has to be protected from deterioration. Marine landforms have good storativity, but are frequently invaded by seawater.|$|R
40|$|Outfalls {{are built}} for the purpose ofdischarging sewage, storm runoff or cooling water into the sea. During the installation, outfalls are exposed to {{relatively}} large hydrodynamic forces compared to their own weight in case of adverse weather or high currents. To resist these forces, a heavy concrete weight coating has to be applied. With increasingly stringent environmental directives, {{it is important to}} situate the end of an outfall further offshore. This is possible by optimising the conservative schematisation of the offshore technology common practice of pipeline stability applied to outfalls. This optimisation can lead to a reduction of the outfall weight coating, which offers perspectives to the construction of longer outfalls and an improved economic design in general. Therefor, research into a less conservative approach of calculating the resultant hydrodynamic forces on outfalls has been carried out as a graduate project at Delft University of Technology. The graduate project concentrates on the most common situation of an outfall built in shallow water, approximately at right angles to the depth <b>contours.</b> <b>Trenching</b> and application of a heavy weight coating have to assure stability during installation. The impact forces on the outfall generated by breaking waves will not be considered. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|The University of Windsor and BAIF Development Research Foundation {{worked with}} the tribal and rural people of Akole Taluka to design a {{strategy}} for access to a year-round water supply. Three villages, comprising 494 households, were selected as partners. Participatory management and evaluation were essential components of the project. Water-harvesting and-spreading technologies {{were put in place}} at demonstration sites over an area of 1, 000 ha. Fourteen masonry check-dams and 3 ferrocement gabions provided about 73, 000 cu m of water for the partner villages and outlying areas. Twenty-six households utilized roofwater-harvesting systems. Up to 20 percent of households took water from six developed springs. Several dug wells were deepened and existing bore wells received workovers. The increase in water availability during the pre-monsoon period was about 750 l/d per capita. Runoff was diverted into shallow aquifers, by means of expanded terracing of hillsides, combined with systems of <b>contour</b> <b>trenches</b> and soil bunds, as well as 19 farm ponds. Infiltration pits were excavated, most notably on unterraced hillslopes. Soil conservation in support of water-resource management involved the use of 75 gabions, 75 drystone bunds and 6, 550 gully plugs. These measures averted erosion losses of up to 150 tonnes of soil per hectare. Grasses, such as vetiver, also were used as barriers across some slopes. Productive, multipurpose tree species and shrubs were planted on agricultural lands, along selected soil bunds. Areas of wasteland were converted to pasture. The demonstration sites satisfied the domestic water needs of the people. The increased soil moisture brought improvements to agricultural production. The project results are sustainable. The lessons learned were incorporated into workshops on watershed management for BAIF personnel, working in other parts of India...|$|R

40|$|The lack of farmer {{awareness}} of {{costs and benefits}} {{associated with the use}} of sustainable land management (SLM) technologies is one of the major constraints to technology adoption in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this study was to estimate the profitability of application of SLM in the form of soil erosion control technologies by communities in the highlands of eastern Uganda; a hot spot for this land degradation agent. A survey was conducted using 240 farmers in the highlands of eastern Uganda. The findings from Partial Budget Analysis indicate that the net returns {{associated with the use of}} soil erosion control technologies, are sufficiently high to offset the costs involved. For example, for every US $ invested per hectare in terracing and tree planting, there is a return of over US $ 15. However, these returns are likely to be much less if inflation is not regulated. For example, the profits expected from the use of terraces and trees would reduce by about 3 percent if inflation rose to 30 percent. Thus, for the benefits to be sustainable, farmers have to regularly maintain the structures (terraces, <b>contours,</b> and <b>trenches)</b> and the vegetation (trees and grasses). Also, use of soil erosion control technologies would remain profitable only if the Central Bank fulfils its mandate of keeping inflation low and stable...|$|R

For sound {{soil and water conservation}} planning, {{there is a need to}} evaluate the various conservation measures as related to the amount of expected runoff and soil erosion. In this context, a field study was conducted in the farmer's field in Nilgiris of South India, for evaluating the impact of farming methods on soil and water conservation efficiency under new tea plantation. One year old B- 6 tea clones were planted at double hedge spacing (135 cm× 75 cm× 75 cm) in two slopes (8 – 12 % and 30 – 35 %) with treatments viz., <b>contour</b> staggered <b>trenches</b> (CST), vegetative barrier (VB), CST alternate with VB, CST with cover crop of beans and farmers’ practice of plantation. Minimum runoff (14. 6 %) was observed from CST with cover crop of beans followed by CST (15. 4 %) under 8 – 12 % slope range with exactly similar trend in runoff from the plots under 30 – 35 % slope. Contrary to runoff, minimum soil loss was observed from CST (4. 9 and 6. 9 tha− 1 yr− 1) followed by CST with cover crop of beans (5. 3 and 7. 3 tha− 1 yr− 1) under 8 – 12 % and 30 – 35 % respectively. Implementation CST and CST with cover crop of beans are resulted in better soil moisture under both the slope ranges in comparison to remaining measures as well as farmers’ practice of plantation.

In eastern Africa, mechanisms for mitigation of this land degradation have been developed, but their uptake has been minimal. Devolution, a mechanism known to entrust communities with decision making tools and powers to plan, implement and monitor activities was tested in the highlands of eastern Africa. Generation of consensus on how to implement the scaling of adoption of SLM innovations is a crucial aspect for evaluating the devolution process. Assignment of clear roles and responsibilities facilitated involvement of multi-displinary stakeholders in managing the process of scaling sustainable land management innovations. At district level, officials appreciated the intervention, streamlined activities in their work plans leading to increased budgets for natural resource management which resulted into increased adoption of SLM technologies.

40|$|Current {{options for}} {{managing}} wastewater biosolids in the United States include both beneficial reuse technologies (such as land application, landfilling with biogas recovery, and energy recovery through incineration) and non-reuse options, including landfilling. While implementing {{some type of}} beneficial reuse is the preferred method for managing wastewater biosolids, {{this is not always}} practical. For example, land acquisition constraints or poor material quality may limit beneficial reuse options. In these situations, landfilling of biosolids may be a viable alternative. Biosolids landfilling options include disposal in a monofill (a landfill that accepts only wastewater treatment plant biosolids), or in a co-disposal landfill (a landfill that combines biosolids with municipal solid waste). Although co-disposal landfilling is more common than monofilling, biosolids typically represent {{only a small percentage of}} the total waste in a co-disposal landfill (WEF, 1998). Landfill disposal of biosolids should not be confused with use of biosolids to amend final cover material at landfills. This practice is a form of land application in which biosolids are added to soil to enhance conditions for growing cover vegetation. The EPA fact sheet Land Application of Biosolids addresses the use of biosolids in rehabilitating disturbed lands. common methods of monofilling wastewater biosolids are the trench, area, and ramp methods. Trench monofilling (Figure 1) involves excavating a trench, placing the biosolids in the trench, and then backfilling the trench to return the soil to its original <b>contours.</b> Monofill <b>trenches</b> can be narrow or wide, depending on the solids concentrations of the biosolids to be filled. Narrow trenches (typically less than 3 m [approximately 10 ft] wide) are generally used for disposal of biosolids with a low solids content. Wide trenches (typically greater than 3 m [approximately 10 ft] wide) are used for disposal of biosolids with a solids content of 20 percent or more. If the biosolids contain less than 20 percent solids, they will not support the machinery used to place the cover material over the trench. Application rates for trenches less than 3 m in width are approximately 2, 270 - 10, 580 m 3 /h...|$|R

We firstly take GPS displacement in two postseismic periods, the first 8 h right after mainshock from 5 : 55 to 14 : 00 UTC and the 13 days from 12 March 2011 to 25 March 2011, to solve for the postseismic slips. The solved postseismic slips are adopted to remove postseismic signal in InSAR and seafloor observation. In order to estimate the effect of postseismic correction and contribution from different geodetic datasets, we invert several coseismic slips with constraints from GPS (Model 1), corrected InSAR (Model 2), combination of GPS and corrected seafloor measurements (Model 3), combination of GPS and corrected InSAR and seafloor measurements (Model 4), and combination of GPS and initial InSAR and seafloor measurements (Model 5). From the comparison of these slip models, we find combined datasets could give more slip details, which is closer to a joint inversion result constrained from both seismic and geodetic datasets (Koketsu et al., 2011). RMSE of seafloor measurements has dropped about 4 cm after applying postseismic correction.
