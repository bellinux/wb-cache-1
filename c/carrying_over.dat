In 1995, the airline posted its first profit on revenues of US$1.05 billion, one year ahead of schedule. Internationally, EVA Air's rapid expansion and increased passenger volume was boosted by its safety record, {{in contrast to}} its primary competitor, China Airlines.

5|$|In late 1808, the French Navy {{despatched}} five frigates to the Indian Ocean to rendezvous at Île de France {{under the}} command of Commodore Jacques Hamelin. Although only four frigates eventually reached the French island, these were new vessels carrying 40 heavy guns each under orders to attack British shipping in the Bay of Bengal, in particular the large East Indiamen of the Honourable East India Company (HEIC). The first frigate to discover a convoys was Caroline, which attacked a Europe-bound convoy in the Action of 31 May 1809. Capturing two East Indiamen <b>carrying</b> <b>over</b> £500,000 worth of silk, Caroline brought her prizes back to the fortified port of Saint Paul on Île Bonaparte.|$|E

40|$|Task {{demands that}} {{influence}} scanning behaviour in one task can cause that behaviour to persist {{to a second}} unrelated task (<b>carry</b> <b>over).</b> This can also affect performance on a second task (e. g., hazard perception ratings), and {{has been attributed to}} a process of attentional bias that is modulated by top-down influences (Thompson & Crundall, 2011). In a series of experiments we explored how these top-down influences impact upon <b>carry</b> <b>over.</b> In all experiments, participants searched letters that were presented horizontally, vertically, or in a random array. They were then presented with a driving scene and rated the hazardousness of the scene. <b>Carry</b> <b>over</b> of eye-movements from the letter search to the scene was observed in all experiments. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that this <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> effect influenced hazard perception accuracy. The magnitude of <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> was correlated with task switching abilities, attentional conflicting, and attentional orienting (Experiment 1), and was affected by predictability of the primary task (Experiment 2). Furthermore, direct current stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal areas affected the magnitude of the effect (Experiment 3). These results indicate that <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> is modulated by the specific ability to orient attention and disengage from this orientation. Over orienting leads to increased <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> and insufficient task switching is detrimental to task performance. As a result the current experiments provide evidence that the <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> effect is strongly influenced by attentional processes, namely orienting, inhibition, and task switching...|$|R

Character designer Raita Honjou and composer Hitoshi Sakimoto both returned from previous entries, along with Valkyria Chronicles II director Takeshi Ozawa. A large team of writers handled the script. The game's opening theme was sung by May'n.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of D.sayi begins with copulation, which {{normally}} takes place shortly after the female has moulted, while her exoskeleton is still soft. Spawning occurs within hours or days of copulation, and the eggs are brooded on the female's pleopods (swimmerets) until {{they are ready to}} hatch. Females have been found carrying eggs from April to October; in a study of crabs caught at Gloucester Point, Virginia in 1978, females were observed to carry between 686 and 14,735 eggs. The number of eggs increases with carapace width according to a power law; extrapolation of the power law suggests that the largest D.sayi females are capable of <b>carrying</b> <b>over</b> 32,000 eggs each.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1798, rumours reached Jervis, {{recently}} ennobled as Earl St Vincent, of a {{buildup of}} French forces around the Mediterranean seaport of Toulon under General Napoleon Bonaparte. Similar rumours had reached the Admiralty in London, and St Vincent therefore sent Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson and three ships of the line to observe French activity. Nelson arrived too late however, and the French fleet had already sailed, <b>carrying</b> <b>over</b> 30,000 men into the Eastern Mediterranean. Nelson, joined by a fleet of ten ships sent by St Vincent under Captain Thomas Troubridge, pursued the French, but failed to learn of their destination before the French fleet captured Malta. Ten days later, Bonaparte sailed for Alexandria for {{the second stage of}} his operation and Nelson's fleet unwittingly passed his during the night, the British beating the French to Egypt but sailing off again before Bonaparte arrived.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Imagine, {{formerly}} known as Megami Tensei Online: Imagine, was a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) for Microsoft Windows personal computers. It {{is part of the}} Megami Tensei series, and was developed by CAVE under license from the series creator Atlus. Originally released in Japan in 2007, it was later released in North America in 2008, then in Europe in 2009. Imagine is set between Shin Megami Tensei and its sequel, {{in the aftermath of a}} war which devastated humanity and prompted the arrival of hostile demons split into two opposing factions: Law and Chaos. The player character, a Demon Buster, is tasked with interacting with and fighting the demons that infest post-apocalyptic Tokyo. The gameplay uses real-time combat in open environments similar to other MMORPGs, while <b>carrying</b> <b>over</b> the Megami Tensei series' recurring demon recruitment and fusion mechanics.|$|E
5|$|The Mary Rose {{first saw}} battle in 1512, {{in a joint}} naval {{operation}} with the Spanish against the French. The English were to meet the French and Breton fleets in the English Channel while the Spanish attacked them in the Bay of Biscay and then attack Gascony. The 35-year-old Sir Edward Howard was appointed Lord High Admiral in April and chose the Mary Rose as his flagship. His first mission was to clear the seas of French naval forces between England to the northern coast of Spain {{to allow for the}} landing of supporting troops near the French border at Fuenterrabia. The fleet consisted of 18 ships, among them the large ships the Regent and the Peter Pomegranate, <b>carrying</b> <b>over</b> 5,000 men. Howard's expedition led to the capture of twelve Breton ships and a four-day raiding tour of Brittany where English forces successfully fought against local forces and burned numerous settlements.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the {{campaign}} against the Dutch squadron in the East Indies allowed British forces in the Indian Ocean to focus exclusively on the French islands of Île Bonaparte and Isle de France, which proved very difficult to subdue during the ensuing Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811. Freedom of movement for British forces in the East Indies proved invaluable however: on 27 January 1807, Peter Rainier in Caroline had seized a Spanish ship San Raphael <b>carrying</b> <b>over</b> half a million Spanish dollars and an exceptionally valuable cargo, {{and the ability of}} British commerce raiders to act against French, Spanish and Dutch merchant shipping in the region was assured. When Pellew's successor Rear-Admiral William O'Bryen Drury attempted to eliminate the Dutch East Indies islands in a series of large scale invasions during 1810 and 1811, British naval movements were completely unopposed, allowing a rapid and successful conclusion to the war in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|No new {{gameplay}} {{content was}} added to Type-0 HD. The team instead focused on upgrading the graphics, adjusting existing gameplay for home consoles, and including a lower difficulty level. The latter was due to complaints from players that the original game was too difficult. While <b>carrying</b> <b>over</b> the original's multiplayer functions was considered, it would have lengthened the estimated development time by another year. Since Tabata's priority was to bring the game to fans worldwide, the multiplayer and associated elements were either removed or incorporated into the single-player campaign. Tabata also decided against creation of a demo or an international version for this reason. As {{a substitute for the}} multiplayer, the team strengthened and improved the original single-player Academy Assistance function. As with the original, the team used the names of developers from both the core team and other Square Enix departments for the NPCs. While the main story remained unchanged, a secret cutscene teasing future Type games was commissioned. Created by Square Enix's CGI movie subsidiary Visual Works, it was based on some of Tabata's early ideas for Type-0. A small piece of the cutscene was shown privately to attendees of Square Enix's 25th anniversary commemoration event for the Final Fantasy series. Hiroki Chiba, writer for Type-0, returned to write the scene. In the cutscene, a fatally-wounded samurai warrior resembling main protagonist Ace is saved from death by a fire spirit.|$|E
5|$|The player {{directly}} {{controls the}} character Lightning through a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the character, which allows for a 360° view of the surroundings. The world of Lightning Returns, as with Final Fantasy XIII and its sequel XIII-2, is rendered to scale with the character, who navigates the world on foot. In one of the areas, the player can use chocobos, a recurring animal in the Final Fantasy series. The player is able to freely navigate the game's open world layout, explore towns and country areas, and accept quests from various non-playable characters (NPCs). Lightning is also able to sprint for limited periods, climb up ladders and jump freely. The game features three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal and Hard, the latter of which is unlocked after first completing the game. There is also a New Game+ option, whereby players can start a new game while <b>carrying</b> <b>over</b> their equipment and stats from a previous playthrough. The in-game clock runs continuously during normal navigation, with one in-game day equating to {{two to three hours}} in real time on Easy mode and one hour on Normal and Hard modes. The timer starts out at seven in-game days, but can be extended to a maximum of thirteen days. The timer stops during cutscenes, conversations and battles. Lightning can also pause time using an ability called Chronostasis.|$|E

5|$|The first {{attack on}} Île de la Passe was {{launched}} {{on the evening}} of 10 August, with Staunch towing boats <b>carrying</b> <b>over</b> 400 soldiers, Royal Marines and volunteer sailors to the island under cover of darkness, guided by Nereides pilot. During the night however, the pilot became lost and the boats were scattered in high winds and had not reassembled by dawn. To distract French attention from the drifting boats, Pym directed Captain Henry Lambert in Iphigenia to sail conspicuously off Port Napoleon, where {{the main body of the}} French squadron, led by Hamelin in Vénus, was based. Pym joined Lambert later in the day and the frigates subsequently returned to the waters of Grand Port by different routes, confusing French observers from the shore as to British intentions. By 13 August, the boats originally intended for the attack had still not been assembled and Pym decided that he could not risk waiting any longer without the French launching a counterattack. Launching his own boats at 8:00 pm, guided by the pilot and commanded by Pym's second in command, Lieutenant Norman, Pym's marines and sailors landed on the island in darkness under heavy fire from the defenders. Norman was killed in the initial exchange of fire, but his deputy, Lieutenant Watling, seized the island by storming the fortifications surrounding the battery. Seven British personnel were killed and 18 wounded in the battle, in which the storming party managed to seize intact French naval code books and took 80 prisoners. Willoughby was furious that Pym had assumed command of the operation without his permission and the officers exchanged angry letters, part of an ongoing disagreement between them that engendered mutual distrust.|$|E
