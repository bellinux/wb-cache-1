5|$|Male {{participation}} in feminism is encouraged by feminists and {{is seen as}} an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that both genders <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism. It has been proposed that, in large part, this can be achieved through considerations of women's agency.|$|E

25|$|The social, {{communicative}} {{practice of}} argumentation <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> {{be distinguished from}} implication (or entailment)—a relationship between propositions; and from inference—a mental activity typically {{thought of as the}} drawing of a conclusion from premises.

25|$|Contravariant and {{covariant}} vectors are geometrically {{very different}} objects. The first <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> {{be thought of}} as arrows. A linear functional can be characterized by two objects: its kernel, which is a hyperplane passing through the origin, and its norm. Geometrically thus covariant vectors should viewed as a set of hyperplanes, with spacing depending on the norm (bigger = smaller spacing), with one of them (the kernel) passing through the origin. The mathematical term for a covariant vector is 1-covector or 1-form (though the latter is usually reserved for covector fields).|$|E
25|$|The church recognizes and officially welcomes {{gays and}} lesbians as members under {{condition}} that they attempt to live the church's moral code. The church teaches that homosexual feelings, as distinct from behavior, may sometimes seem to be inborn, and that although these feelings are sometimes unwanted, they <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> be controlled. The church's law of chastity forbids homosexual sex in all contexts. Consistently breaking the law of chastity may result in excommunication. Nevertheless, Latter-day Saints who identify themselves as gay or lesbian may remain in good standing in the church, without ramification, if they abstain from homosexual relations.|$|E

25|$|Dewey's {{educational}} theories {{were presented}} in My Pedagogic Creed (1897), The School and Society (1900), The Child and the Curriculum (1902), Democracy and Education (1916) and Experience and Education (1938). Several themes recur throughout these writings. Dewey continually argues that education and learning are social and interactive processes, and thus the school itself is a social institution through which social reform <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> take place. In addition, he believed that students thrive {{in an environment where}} they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum, and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their own learning.|$|E
25|$|Keynes was {{the first}} {{economist}} to popularize macroeconomics and also the notion that governments <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> intervene in the economy to alleviate the suffering caused by unemployment. Before the Keynesian Revolution that followed Keynes's 1936 publication of his General Theory, the prevailing orthodoxy was that the economy would naturally establish full employment. So successful was the revolution that the period spanning the aftermath of World War II to about 1973 {{has been referred to}} as the Age of Keynes. Stagnating economic performance in the early 1970s successfully shattered the previous consensus for Keynesian economics and provided support for a counter revolution. Milton Friedman's monetarism school was prominent in displacing Keynes' ideas both in academia and from the practical world of economic policy making.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 {{a number}} of Conservative rabbis issued responsa on the same subject, arguing that women <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> be counted in the prayer minyan. These papers were written {{as part of the}} process of JTS {{deciding}} on whether or not to admit women to its rabbinic and cantorial programs. However, the Chancellor of JTS at the time took this process out of the hands of the CJLS, and made the process an affair of the JTS faculty, a move that caused strong controversy, and several resignations of Talmud faculty from JTS. The decision to allow women to become rabbinical and cantorial candidates was then based on a vote of JTS faculty, in principle based on their readings of these responsa and their own understanding of the relevant texts.|$|E

25|$|While Conservative Judaism would {{affirm that}} the Torah is Divine in its origin, the revelation at Sinai {{is seen as}} the {{beginning}} of a relationship and not the final word. Interpretation is understood as our communal attempt to understand the will of a compassionate Divine partner. As we mature we are able to understand God's will for us more clearly. If a law appears unconscionable, we would say that the shortcoming is either our previous understanding or that circumstances have so changed that the rule no longer meets its intended result...The Conservative movement maintains {{that the purpose of the}} law in the first place is largely to concretize moral values, and so the specific form of the law <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> be changed if it is not effectively doing that. In other words, the Aggadah should control the halakha.|$|E
25|$|Given the Singapore government's {{focus on}} efficiency, {{the country has}} been said to {{emphasize}} a largely green-light approach towards administrative law. Public administration is not seen as a necessary evil but a positive attribute, and the objective of administrative law is not primarily to stop bad administrative practices but to encourage good ones. In this approach, recourse to the judiciary is not the first line of defence against administrative abuses of powers. Instead, it is perceived that control <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> come internally from Parliament and the executive itself in upholding high standards of public administration and policy. In other words, instead of redressing bad government through the courts, good government should be sought through the political process and public avenues. Courts play a supporting role by articulating clear rules and principles by which the Singapore government may abide and conform to the rule of law.|$|E

500|$|The volume {{contains}} {{a number of}} arguments. However, four themes have {{a central role in}} the overall work.

Second, the work emphasises that there are different forms of social power, and that these forms are substantially interrelated. Third, Power insists that [...] "organisations are usually connected with certain kinds of individuals". Finally, the work ends by arguing that [...] "arbitrary rulership <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> be subdued".|$|E
