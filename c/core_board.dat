Generally, retention ratios of modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), and internal bond (IB) strength after the boil test increased with increased pressing temperature. In particular, the MOR retention ratio of boards with a pressing temperature of 200 °C (average 106.4 %) was higher than that of a commercial medium-density fiberboard (MDF) (melamine-urea-formaldehyde resin) (average 72.7 %), and the value sometimes exceeded 100 %. The durability of kenaf <b>core</b> binderless <b>boards</b> with a pressing temperature of 200 °C compared favorably with that of the commercial MDF (melamine-urea-formaldehyde resin), having almost the same retained strength values after the boil test.|$|R

Modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), internal bonding strength (IB), thickness change, weight loss, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, and color difference (ΔE*) by the CIE L*a*b* system were measured at various outdoor exposure periods up to 19 months. These values were then {{compared with those of}} a commercial medium-density fiberboard (MDF; melamine-urea-formaldehyde resin; thickness 9.0 mm, density 0.75 g/cm 3). Generally, dimensional stability and the retention ratios of MOR, MOE, and IB after the outdoor {{exposure test}} increased with increased pressing temperature of binderless boards. The MOR retention ratio of the kenaf <b>core</b> binderless <b>boards</b> with a pressing temperature of 200 °C was 59.5 % after 12 months of outdoor exposure, which was slightly lower than that of the MDF (75.6 % after 11 months of outdoor exposure).

40|$|A {{review of}} {{literature}} and standards revealed no standardized process exists for the evaluation or characterization of wind uplift resistance of Adhesive Applied Roofing Systems (AARS). It was determined that a pullout test method [...] a test in which the adhered components of roofing samples were subjected to tensile loading until failure [...] {{could be used to}} quantify wind uplift performance. From the literature study, critical variables were extracted. Among these were the pullout rate, the specimen size and the specimen attachment condition. After conducting a series of extensive pullout tests, data showed that the optimum pullout rate was 6. 35 mm/min. Additional tests showed that a specimen size of 300 mm x 450 mm with all flutes fastened provided the experimentally consistent data. Based on the investigation outlined above, the present study drafted a standard test method for the determination of the pullout resistance of adhesively applied roofing components. This contribution is being presented to the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) and American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) for adoption of a standardized test method. The present study also implemented the standardized test procedure to characterize the pullout behaviour of a variety of different configurations.
