40|$|The {{idea of an}} {{inevitable}} process of centralization in the European Community (EC) /European Union (EU) is a myth. Also, the metaphor of creeping competences, with its suggestion of a surreptitious but continuous growth of {{the powers of the}} Commission, can be misleading. It is true that the functional scope of EC/EU competences has steadily increased, but the nature of new competences has changed dramatically, as may be seen from the evolution of the methods of harmonization. The original emphasis on total harmonization, which gives the <b>Community</b> <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence</b> over a given policy area, has been largely replaced by more flexible but less communitarian methods such as optional and minimum harmonization, reference to nonbinding technical standards, and mutual recognition. Finally, the treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam explicitly excluded harmonization for most new competences. Thus, the expansion of the jurisdiction of the EC/EU has not automatically increased the powers of the Commission, but has actually weakened them in several respects. In addition, the progressive parliamentarization of the Commission risks compromising its credibility as an independent regulator, without necessarily enhancing its democratic legitimacy. Since the member states continue to oppose any centralization of regulatory powers, even in areas essential to the functioning of the internal market, the task of implementing Community policies should be entrusted to networks of independent national and European regulators, roughly modeled on the European System of Central Banks. The Commission would coordinate and monitor the activities of these networks in order to ensure the coherence of EC regulatory policies. More generally, it should bring its distinctive competence more clearly into focus by concentrating on the core business of ensuring the development and proper functioning of the single European market. This is a more modest role than that of the kernel of a future government of Europe, but it is essential to the credibility of the integration process and does not overstrain the limited financial and legitimacy resources available to the Commission...|$|E

40|$|European <b>Community’s</b> <b>Exclusive</b> <b>Competence</b> in Demarcation of ExternalCompetencies] The need {{to discuss}} the European <b>Community’s</b> (EC) <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence</b> in {{external}} relations arises because it must be established who {{has the power to}} act in the international field and assume obligations before third states, whether the EC or Member States. The main problem in demarcation of external competencies lies in the mere fact that there are no significant expressis verbis provisions in the Treaty establishing the European Community. As a result, the Court of Justice has developed several different competencies. Although there are besides the <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence</b> also shared, concurrent and complementary competencies, the <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence</b> {{is the only one that}} forbids Member States to act or take obligations in certain area. But <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence</b> in turn divides into three principles. These principles, found by the Court, are principles of a priori, AETR judgment and opinion 1 / 76. The principle of a priori means that the exclusivity is reserved to expressis verbis provisions that have the external element. The principle of the AETR judgment arises whenever EC institutions have exercised any power in the area in question. The principle of the opinion 1 / 76 means that whenever an international agreement is to be concluded in the area where EC has not implemented internal regulations then the EC has the power to conclude an international agreement in question only if effective application of the internal regulations is “inextricably linked” with the international commitments taken. The Courts reasoning in the latest most significant case law, open skies judgments and the Lugano opinion, has lead to uniform and logical framework which enabled the author to draw up a questionnaire that helps the interested party to determine if he has the competence to take international obligations in respective question...|$|R
25|$|Consequently, it is {{suggested}} that the management of the CFP could be improved through the application of the theory of subsidiarity—the principle that political decisions should be handled at the lowest, least-centralised competent level. The subsidiarity principle was introduced into EU policies as part of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty; however, it does not apply to areas such as the CFP over which the <b>Community</b> retains <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence.</b> A partial devolution of authority, for example involving Member States in the decision-making process and delegating the day-to-day management of fisheries to industry-based organisations, could potentially facilitate the inclusion of industry concerns into the CFP, involving those directly affected by the policy in management decisions and creating to a CFP which encourages compliance and collaboration.|$|R
40|$|While the European <b>Community</b> has <b>exclusive</b> <b>{{competence}}</b> {{for trade}} policy, the competence over development policy is shared with member {{states of the}} European Union (EU). Given that trade is communitarised, it could be assumed {{that it is a}} strong instrument for the EU that can be well used for development. Trade is a particularly prominent feature of the EU’s relations to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of developing countries, and Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) are the envisaged new trade pillar of ACP-EU-cooperation. This study analyses the development relevance of the EU’s trade policy towards the ACP countries as formulated in the EPA, with a view to drawing conclusions on how to strengthen the trade development nexus. It specifically assesses {{the way in which the}} EU as a multilevel system has operated in the EPA negotiations. It is notably argued that the EU system needs to be more flexible to respond to issues of development concern in the trade negotiations, e. g. market access and support measures for ACP states. Efforts are furthermore required to improve the coordination of European policy-making on trade and development. Both the EU’s communitarian and bilateral policies will need to engage in a more complementary fashion to support productive and trading capacities in the ACP and developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Studies of the European Union's role in {{international}} policy negotiations typically focus either on trade agreements, where the <b>Community</b> often enjoys <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence</b> in negotiations, or on military and security accords, where Member States take the diplomatic lead {{in international}} talks. Between these extremes {{are a number}} of issue negotiations in which Community officials and Member State representatives speak jointly on behalf of the EU. We analyse one such 'mixed competence' case - the negotiations for a global biosafety protocol - to understand more about the EU's behaviour and bargaining power in such settings. We aim for explanatory parsimony by applying an existing model designed to predict EU bargaining power in international trade negotiations (Meunier, 2000). The analysis reveals that the trade model has considerable explanatory power for some of the outcomes found in the biosafety protocol negotiations, but incorrectly predicts that the EU will have no bargaining power. We then explore the sources of discrepancy between the model's predictions and our empirical results, thereby identifying some of the general differences between <b>exclusive</b> and mixed <b>competence</b> negotiations. We conclude by making suggestions for future model-building and by reflecting on some recent proposed changes that may affect the EU's bargaining power on the global stage.

40|$|The 2004 {{enlargement}} negotiations smoothly {{tackled the}} European Common Fisheries Policy. The reason is mainly {{to be found}} in the geographical transformation of ocean governance. The provisions regulating ‘who should fish what and where’, underwent a substantial change by means of temporal derogations. On the one hand the equal access principle eroded, as fishing in waters within 12 miles off the baselines - where most commercial fish stock are situated - became reserved towards the nationals of the coastal State. On the other hand the competence to adopt conservation measures has followed this geographical appropriation of fishing grounds, as the <b>exclusive</b> <b>Community</b> <b>competence</b> in this field is pushed out beyond the coastal waters. A return to the original provisions seems utopian, as evidenced again by the outcome of the 2004 enlargement negotiations.

40|$|Subsidiarity {{emerged in}} Europe in the {{practice}} of self-governing local communities. The subsidiarity principle {{is one of the most}} solid pillars of the societies’ organization. According to the dictionary of the Spanish Real Academy (Academia Real Española), subsidiarity is “a favorable trend in complementary participation (subsidiary) of the State in private or community support activities”. In recent studies on this principle it was concluded that subsidiarity is a polyhedral concept, taking into account its theological, philosophical, political, and not least, juridicial origins. Subsidiarity is a general principle applicable only to situations when it is recognized a shared competence between the Community and the Member States. <b>Exclusive</b> <b>Community</b> <b>competence</b> established by the Treaty is not recognized as being subject to subsidiarity. Subsidiarity is the level by which the society is released from the state’s tutelage, is the way in which citizens agree to articulate and monitor state power so that it will not be in a position to nurture itself and ambition to produce and control the citizen...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{establishment}} of competition rules forms part of the EU’s <b>exclusive</b> <b>competences,</b> the application and enforcement of those rules has always been shared consistently between the EU and its Member States. The sharing of enforcement powers is conceptualised traditionally as a delegation of the exercise of exclusively conferred competences. The Court of Justice of the European Union’s case law {{in the context of}} EU antitrust law enforcement nevertheless raises profound questions as to the overall tenability of this delegation framework in this particular field of EU <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence.</b> This contribution argues the traditional <b>exclusive</b> <b>competences</b> narrative indeed fails to grasp the system of shared enforcement powers underlying EU antitrust law.

The analysis reveals that the trade model has considerable explanatory power for some of the outcomes found in the Biosafety Protocol negotiations, but incorrectly predicts that the EU will have no bargaining power.

We conclude the article by making suggestions for future model building and by reflecting on changes in the new Constitutional Treaty that may affect the EU’s bargaining power on the global stage. The paper is structured as follows. First, we briefly review the literature on the EU in global negotiations before presenting the key parameters and predictions of the Meunier model. Second, we demonstrate the differences between ‘exclusive’ and ‘mixed’ negotiation competences in the EU, and highlight environmental policy negotiations {{as an example of the}} latter. Third, we test the predictions of the Meunier model against the case of the Biosafety Protocol negotiations. While the model predicts no bargaining power for the EU in this type of case, we show, against expectations, the EU was a tough bargainer and achieved virtually all of its aims in the final agreement. Fourth, we discuss the potential sources of this discrepancy in the Meunier model and offer suggestions for future model building. The conclusion summarizes the paper and highlights several trends that may affect the EU’s behavior in forthcoming international negotiations...|$|R

40|$|The author {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between establishing of new organs of state administration {{and the idea of}} the federal state. In the conditions of the federation some relatively independnt systems of central state administration exist, conducted by particular authorities and corresponding representative organs. The competence of federal and republican organs of central state administration is based on the Czechoslovak Federation Act and other legal regulations. The federal structure of the Czechoslovak Federal Republic results in a structure different from that of a Unitarian state. The Czechoslovak Federation Act divided the former Unitarian state functions between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic on one hand, and the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic on the other. Some matters have been committed to the <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence</b> of the CSSR and others to the joint competence of the CSSR and both republics, or else to the <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence</b> of either republic. The <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence</b> of the federation covers foreign affairs including foreign policy, international contracts, representation of the CSSR and decisions on war and peace, defence of the CSSR, monetary matters, federal state material resources, federal legislation and administration within the competence of the federation, supervision of activity of federal organs, and protection of constitutional principles of the federation. The <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence</b> of the federation is based on the principle that in the above fields only the legislative and executive organs of state authorities, organs of state administration and federal judicial organs may operate. The joint competence of the federation and both republics covers planning, finance matters, banking system, fixing of prices, economic relations with foreign countries, industry, agriculture and food, transport, post office and telecommunication, development of science and technology, capital investments, labour and social policy, statistics, economic arbitration, industrial norms, legal situation of corporations, internal order and safety, the press, supervision. The <b>exclusive</b> <b>competence</b> of republics covers particularly such matters as: the health service, education,, culture, home trade, justice, forestry and water resources, land-surveying and mapping, granting of academic degrees, safety of work. The present development of the system of state administration, {{from the point of view}} of its organization, consists of development of traditional forms of state administration, but also gradual establishing and developing of new organs of state administration. This phenomenon is closely accompanied by a process of disappearing of certain previously existing administrative organs.
