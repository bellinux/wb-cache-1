40|$|This {{presentation}} features {{linguistic and}} terminology management {{issues related to}} the development of the Spanish version of the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED). It aims at describing the aspects of translating and the difficulties encountered in delivering a natural and consistent medical nomenclature. Bunge's three-layered model is referenced to analyze the sequence of symbolic concept representations. It further explains how a communicative translation based on a concept-to-concept approach was used to achieve the highest level of flawlessness and naturalness for the Spanish rendition of SNOMED. Translation procedures and techniques are described and exemplified. Both the <b>computer-aided</b> and human <b>translation</b> methods are portrayed. The scientific and translation team tasks are detailed, with focus on Newmark's four-level principle for the translation process, extended with a fifth further level relevant to the ontology to control the consistency of the typology of concepts. Finally the convenience for a common methodology to develop non-English versions of SNOMED is suggested...|$|R
50|$|Although {{interactive}} {{machine translation}} is a sub-field of <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation,</b> the main attractive {{of the former}} {{with respect to the}} latter is the interactivity. In classical <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation,</b> the translation system may suggest one translation hypothesis in the best case, and then the user is required to post-edit such hypothesis. In contrast, in interactive machine translation the system produces a new translation hypothesis each time the user interacts with the system, i.e. after each word (or letter) has been introduced.|$|E
50|$|Computer-assisted translation, <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation</b> or CAT {{is a form}} of {{language}} translation in which a human translator uses computer software to support and facilitate the translation process.|$|E

50|$|Machine translation, {{sometimes}} referred to by the abbreviation MT (not {{to be confused with}} <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation,</b> machine-aided human translation (MAHT) or interactive translation) is a sub-field of computational linguistics that investigates the use of software to translate text or speech from one language to another.|$|E
50|$|TranslateCAD is a {{tool for}} <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation</b> {{software}} designed to extract translatable text from CAD drawings saved in the industry-standard DXF format - regardless of the CAD software used to create such drawings - so that professional translators are able to translate in plain text using a number of CAT tools available.|$|E
5000|$|Across Systems {{develops}} {{and produces}} Across Language Server, a leading CAT (<b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation)</b> tool besides and competing with SDL Trados and MemoQ. Across Systems {{was founded in}} 2005 as a spin-off of the Nero AG already mentioned above. The company is located in Glendale, California and Karlsbad-Ittersbach with its headquarters at the latter one.|$|E
50|$|Interactive Machine Translation (IMT), is a {{specific}} sub-field of <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation.</b> Under this translation paradigm, the computer software that assists the human translator attempts to predict the text the user is going to input by taking into account all the information it has available. Whenever such prediction is wrong and the user provides feedback to the system, a new prediction is performed considering the new information available. Such process is repeated until the translation provided matches the user's expectations.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{interactive}} {{machine translation}} is born as an {{evolution of the}} <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation</b> paradigm, where the human translator and the machine translation system were intended {{to work as a}} tandem.This first work was extended within the TransType research project, funded by the Canadian government. In this project, the human interaction was aimed towards producing the target text for the first time by embedding data-driven machine translation techniques within the interactive translation environment with the goal of achieving the best of both actors: the efficiency of the automatic system and the reliability of human translators.|$|E
50|$|In the {{outsourcing}} model, {{developers and}} publishers will usually provide the translation {{company with a}} localization kit. A localization kit may contain elements such as general information about the project (including deadlines, contact information, software details), resources about the game itself (a walkthrough, plot or character descriptions, cheat codes), reference materials (glossaries of terms used in the game world or used for the specific hardware), software (such as <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation</b> tools), code, and the assets to be translated (text files, graphics, audio, and so forth). An insufficient localization kit can severely hamper translation efforts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Due {{importance}} has not {{yet been}} attached to the application of <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation</b> (CAT) in the teaching activities in the institutes of higher learning in China. With the differentiation of machine translation and <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation,</b> this paper tries to clarify the process involved in CAT and illustrate what is expected to be improved within the field of the research of <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation.</b> It is pointed out in this paper that much effort is required to be made to combine the teaching of translation with <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation</b> in a scientific way, with the training of <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation</b> technology taking up its due position in the curriculum of the institutes of higher learning in an effort to facilitate the development of market-oriented and vocation-oriented talents of foreign language and translation...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{reports on}} the author’s {{experience}} as a teacher of <b>Computer-Aided</b> <b>Translation</b> in a distance post-graduate translation course. After analysing the features of <b>Computer-Aided</b> <b>Translation,</b> the author draws a parallel between this subject and its fellow research and practice field, Computer Assisted Language Learning, in order to define a common theoretical and methodological framework. The author then introduces the online course in which {{he works as a}} teacher of <b>Computer-Aided</b> <b>Translation</b> and illustrates how the drawbacks of teaching technology online together with the features of the subject have induced him to define an ad hoc teaching methodology so as to simplify as much as possible his learners’ work. This is done through a series of strategies, e. g. by shortening each tutorial step, by adding pictures and by using forum discussion and screencasts as a support medium...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{study focused}} on how human translators (HTs) {{performed}} translation task, which could contribute {{to a good start}} in designing and prototyping <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation</b> (CAT) system. Data gathered from 20 subjects was analyzed with cognitive task analysis (CTA) technique. The user model derived from CTA was integrated into CAT system, where user modeling (UM) technique served in prototyping the adaptive and interactive system. UM would customize the properties of individual HTs with their task within the CAT system. HTs can use the help facilities available on the system to support their routine and non-routine tasks.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of translation memory for <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation</b> {{depends on the}} results of previous sentence alignment. This paper describes a new approach to sentence alignment, based on a crosslingual querying using the technology of an existing product, SPIRIT (Syntactic and Probabilistic Indexing and Retrieval of Information in Texts). Sentence alignment and crosslingual querying based on bilingual reformulation are similar problems: both are based on a semantic proximity between two texts in different languages; both aim to find the sentences that contain most of the information demanded by the query. However, sentence alignment requires the irrelevant part of a sentence to be as short as possible. Crosslingual querying provides sentence alignment with candidates. ARCADE evaluation has shown that this approach is very robust in the cases of inverted sentence order and missing segments. 1. Introduction to sentence alignment The problem of <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation</b> has bee [...] ...|$|E

In addition the system provides information on internal and external recurrence rates. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Based on {{status quo}} {{analysis}} of the current machine translation and <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation,</b> this study intends {{to look into the}} core technologies of multilingual translation memory. This study takes the holistic perspective that views example-based machine translation and <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation</b> memory as two contrasting and also complementary solutions to account for the complexity and diversity and world languages in translation. Also, Technological solutions to a multi-lingual translation project are discussed in accordance with the problem analyses. Three core technologies are brought into detailed analysis. In calculating sentence similarities, this study argues in favor of a mixed method of minimum edit distance. In structuring a multi-lingual translation memory, an exemplary structure in XML format is proposed. And for translation cleaning up, the routine practice is adjusted to fit a CAT system with a multi-lingual translation memory. This paper ends with a concluding remark of this study and by bringing up the future work. Index Terms- multi-lingual translation memory, sentence similarity, TM structure, translation cleaning up.

40|$|This paper aims to {{construct}} Chinese-Tibetan multi-word equivalent pair dictionary for Chinese-Tibetan <b>computer-aided</b> <b>translation</b> system. Since Tibetan is a morphologically rich language, we propose two-phase framework to automatically extract multi-word equivalent pairs. First, extract Chinese Multi-word Units (MWUs). In this phase, we propose CBEM model to partition a Chinese sentence into MWUs using two measures of collocation and binding degree. Second, get Tibetan translations of the extracted Chinese MWUs.
