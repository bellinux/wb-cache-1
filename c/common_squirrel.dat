25|$|The eastern gray {{squirrel}} is an introduced species {{in a variety}} of locations in western North America: in western Canada, to the southwest corner of British Columbia and to the city of Calgary, Alberta; in the United States, to the states of Washington and Oregon and, in California, to the city of San Francisco and the San Francisco Peninsula area in San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties, south of the city. It has become the most <b>common</b> <b>squirrel</b> in many urban and suburban habitats in western North America, from north of central California to southwest British Columbia. At the turn of the 20th century, the eastern {{gray squirrel}} was introduced into South Africa, Ireland, Hawaii, Bermuda, Madeira Island, the Azores, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Italy and the United Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey {{is a member}} of the family Cebidae, the family of New World monkeys containing {{squirrel monkey}}s, capuchin monkeys, tamarins and marmosets. Within the family Cebidae, it {{is a member of}} the subfamily Saimiriinae, the subfamily containing squirrel monkeys. It is one of five recognized species of squirrel monkey, and the only species occurring outside South America. The Central American Squirrel Monkey is placed in genus Saimiri (Voigt, 1831) along with all the other squirrel monkey species. Among the squirrel monkeys, the Central American squirrel monkey is most closely related to the <b>common</b> <b>squirrel</b> monkey (Saimiri sciureus) and the bare-eared squirrel monkey (Saimiri ustus) and these three species form the S. sciureus species group. [...] The binomial name Saimiri oerstedii was given by Johannes Theodor Reinhardt in honor of his fellow Danish biologist Anders Sandøe Ørsted.|$|E

50|$|The black {{squirrel}} monkey (Saimiri vanzolinii), {{also known as}} the blackish {{squirrel monkey}} or black-headed squirrel monkey, is a small New World primate, endemic to the central Amazon in Brazil. It largely resembles the female of the far more <b>common</b> Bolivian <b>squirrel</b> monkey, though the latter lacks the black central back.|$|R

500|$|Slow lorises {{are sold}} locally at street markets, {{but are also}} sold internationally over the Internet and in pet stores. They are {{especially}} popular or trendy in Japan, particularly among women. The reasons for their popularity, according to the Japan Wildlife Conservation Society (JWCS), are that [...] "they're easy to keep, they don't cry, they're small, and just very cute." [...] Along with the <b>common</b> <b>squirrel</b> monkey (Saimirisciureus), slow lorises {{are the most popular}} primate pets in Japan. Pet shops frequently advertise them, even on their websites, with prices ranging between [...] and more than , or [...] Despite these frequent advertisements, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC) reported only a few dozen slow lorises were imported in 2006, suggesting frequent smuggling. Slow lorises are also smuggled to China, Taiwan, Europe, and Saudi Arabia for use as pets. Smuggling and trade in Poland and Russia are also common according to Nekaris.|$|E
2500|$|The white-fronted {{capuchin}} frequently {{travels with}} the <b>common</b> <b>squirrel</b> monkey {{and at other}} times with the tufted capuchin and Venezuelan red howler. The double-toothed kite often accompanies these monkeys, exactly as it does other species of primates. The white-fronted capuchin feels threatened by avian predators, and it is very vigilant around any large bird of prey. In Vichada, Colombia, tayra, Boa constrictor and the ornate hawk-eagle have been seen trying to capture the monkey. After detecting the tayra and Boa constrictor the members of the troop showed little fear and caution, even though these animals threatened the monkeys. The most common behavior after detecting a potential ground predator is [...] "ya-ya" [...] vocalization and branch breaking over the head of the potential predator, similar to the display of the brown woolly monkey. In contrast, after being frightened by a male ornate hawk-eagle the monkeys screamed intensely only once, then hid quietly, some descending to the ground to sneak away.|$|E

5000|$|At {{least five}} populations of <b>common</b> <b>squirrel</b> monkeys have existed in Florida since the 1960s, if not earlier. <b>Common</b> <b>squirrel</b> monkeys have been {{established}} at Silver Springs {{since at least the}} late 1960s; rhesus macaques were established in the area by 1938, but there is no firm information on when the squirrel monkeys were released. In the 1960s, a colony of twelve to fifteen <b>common</b> <b>squirrel</b> monkeys was noted residing in a hammock of trees by the springs; they migrated downstream to the Ocklawaha River by 1975. Another population, derived from two pairs released in the 1960s, lives on the Bartlett Estate in Broward County; they numbered 43 in 1988. In 1976, 15 squirrel monkeys escaped from the Tropic Wonderland attraction in Titusville, Florida; their descendants have since become established in the area. In the 1980s, 500 and 1000 <b>common</b> <b>squirrel</b> monkeys remained in the shuttered Masterpiece Gardens park in Polk County, persisting despite efforts to capture them. Additionally, a [...] "semi-free-ranging" [...] population has existed at Monkey Jungle in Goulds in Miami-Dade County since 1960.|$|E

5000|$|The genetic studies led by Lynch Alfaro {{concluded}} that robust and gracile capuchin monkey genera diverged about 6.2 million years ago.

[...] In contrast, capuchins diverged from their nearest <b>common</b> relative, <b>squirrel</b> monkeys, over 13 million years ago. [...] Lynch Alfaro suggested that the formation of the Amazon River may have caused the split that led to separation of robust and gracile capuchins. [...] The robust capuchins then evolved in the Atlantic forest, while the gracile capuchins evolved in the Amazon.|$|R
