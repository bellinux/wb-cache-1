40|$|The Community Atmosphere <b>Model</b> (<b>CAM)</b> is the {{atmosphere}} {{component of the}} Community Climate System Model (CCSM), and is the largest consumer of computing resources in typical CCSM simulations. The parallel implementation of the Community Atmosphere <b>Model</b> (<b>CAM)</b> employs {{a number of different}} domain decompositions. Currently, each decomposition must utilize the same number of MPI processes, limiting the scalability of CAM to that of the least scalable decomposition. This limitation becomes unacceptably restrictive when including additional physical processes such as atmospheric chemistry or cloud-resolving physics. This paper reports on current efforts to improve CAM scalability by allowing the number of active MPI processes to vary between domain decompositions. 1...|$|R

40|$|Mediation is {{the process}} of decomposing a task into subtasks, finding agents {{suitable}} for these subtasks and negotiating with agents to obtain commitments to execute these subtasks. This process involves several decisions to be made by a mediator including which tasks to mediate, when to interrupt the current task mediation to pursue a better task, etc. The main contribution of this work is integrating the different aspects of a mediator decision problem into one coherent and simple decision theoretic model. This model is then used to learn an optimal policy for a mediator. We propose a generalization of the original Semi-MDP (SMDP) model, which allows efficient representation of the mediator decision problem.

Probability distribution functions (PDFs) of daily mean rainfall in three geographic locations [the Amazon Basin and western Pacific in December–February (DJF) and the North American Great Plains in June–August (JJA) ] indicate that the CAM produces too much light–moderate rainfall (10 20 mm day 1), and not enough heavy rainfall, compared to observa-tions. The MMF underestimates rain contributions from the lightest rainfall rates but correctly simulates more intense rainfall events. These differences are not always apparent in seasonal mean rainfall totals. Analysis of 3 – 6 -hourly rainfall and sounding data in the same locations reveals that the CAM produces moderately intense rainfall as soon as the boundary layer energizes. Precipitation is also concurrent with tropospheric relative humidity and lifted parcel buoyancy increases. In contrast, the MMF and observations are characterized by a lag of several hours between boundary layer energy buildup and precipitation, and a gradual increase in the depth of low-level relative humidity maximum prior to rainfall. The environmental entrainment rate selection in the CAM cumulus parameterization influences CAM precipitation timing and intensity, and may contribute to the midlevel dry bias in that model. The resulting low-intensity rainfall in the CAM leads to rainfall–canopy vegetation interactions that are different from those simulated by the MMF. The authors present evidence suggesting that this interaction may artificially inflate North American Great Plains summertime rainfall totals in the CAM. 1...|$|R
