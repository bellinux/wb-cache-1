2500|$|In 1947 Bell Labs was {{the first}} to propose a {{cellular}} radio telephone network. The primary innovation was the development of a network of small overlapping cell sites supported by a <b>call</b> <b>switching</b> infrastructure that tracks users as they move through a network and passes their calls from one site to another without dropping the connection. In 1956 the MTA system was launched in Sweden. The early efforts to develop mobile telephony faced two significant challenges: allowing a great number of callers to use the comparatively few available frequencies simultaneously and allowing users to seamlessly move from one area to another without having their calls dropped. [...] Both problems were solved by Bell Labs employee Amos Joel who, in 1970 applied for a patent for a mobile communications system. [...] However, a business consulting firm calculated the entire U.S. market for mobile telephones at 100,000 units and the entire worldwide market at no more than 200,000 units based on the ready availability of pay telephones and the high cost of constructing cell towers. [...] As a consequence, Bell Labs concluded that the invention was [...] "of little or no consequence," [...] leading it not to attempt to commercialize the invention. [...] The invention earned Joel induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008. [...] The first call on a handheld mobile phone was made on April 3, 1973 by Martin Cooper, then of Motorola to his opposite number in Bell Labs who were also racing to be first. [...] Bell Labs went on to install the first trial cellular network in Chicago in 1978. This trial system was licensed by the FCC to ATT for commercial use in 1982 and, as part of the divestiture arrangements for the breakup of ATT, the AMPS technology was distributed to local telcos. [...] The first commercial system opened in Chicago in October 1983. [...] A system designed by Motorola also operated in the Washington D.C./Baltimore area from summer 1982 and became a full public service later the following year. [...] Japan's first commercial radiotelephony service was launched by NTT in 1978.|$|E

50|$|TSAPI, {{short for}} Telephony Server Application Programming Interface, was a {{computer}} telephony integration standard developed and promoted by Novell and AT&T. It consisted {{of a number of}} call control commands for switching calls, voice mail and call logging using NetWare servers. Unlike the competing TAPI from Microsoft/Intel, TSAPI was a server-based system that did not expect client-side equipment to handle <b>call</b> <b>switching.</b> This was important to AT&T, who sold large telephone switches that TSAPI was intended to work with.|$|E

5000|$|Also in 1971, CSELT {{built the}} [...] "Gruppi Speciali", a {{time-division}} processing computer for telephone <b>call</b> <b>switching.</b> It {{was the second}} electronic switching system in Europe, but very advanced in design: e.g. in 1975 was introduced {{for the first time}} an architecture-independent automatic bootstrap from ROM composed from semiconductors, pushing a single button (and not by a long hand procedure input as in the past) and with the storage of the machine state of the switch, {{in order to have a}} quick automatic reboot of the switch in case of failure.|$|E

5000|$|The {{crossbar}} switch itself was simple: exchange design moved all the logical decision-making {{to the common}} control elements, which were very reliable as relay sets. The design criterion was to have two hours of [...] "downtime" [...] for service every forty years, which was a huge improvement on earlier electromechanical systems. The exchange design concept lent itself to incremental upgrades, as the control elements could be replaced separately from the <b>call</b> <b>switching</b> elements. The minimum size of a crossbar exchange was comparatively large, but in city areas with a large installed line capacity the whole exchange occupied less space than other exchange technologies of equivalent capacity. For this reason they were also typically the first switches to be replaced with digital systems, which were even smaller and more reliable.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{personal}} computer technology in the 1980s, computer telephony integration (CTI) has progressively provided more sophisticated telephony services, initiated and controlled by the computer, such as making and receiving voice, fax, and data calls with telephone directory services and caller identification. The integration of telephony software and computer systems is a major development {{in the evolution of}} the automated office. The term is used in describing the computerized services of call centers, such as those that direct your phone call to the right department at a business you're calling. It's also sometimes used to describe the ability to use your personal computer to initiate and manage phone calls (in which case you can think of your computer as your personal call center). CTI is not a new concept and has been used in the past in large telephone networks, but only dedicated call centers could justify the costs of the required equipment installation. Primary telephone service providers are offering information services such as automatic number identification, which is a telephone service architecture that separates CTI services from <b>call</b> <b>switching</b> and will make it easier to add new services. Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) on a scale is wide enough for its implementation to bring real value to business or residential telephone usage. A new generation of applications (middleware) is being developed as a result of standardization and availability of low cost computer telephony links.|$|E

40|$|Service {{architectures}} {{are necessary}} for providing value-added services in telecommunications networks, including those in medical institutions. Separation of service logic and control from the actual <b>call</b> <b>switching</b> is the main idea of these service architectures, examples include Intelligent Network (IN), Telecommunications Information Network Architectures (TINA), and Open Service Access (OSA). In the Distributed Service Architectures (DSA), instances of the same object type can be placed on different physical nodes. Hence, the network performance can be enhanced by introducing load balancing algorithms to efficiently distribute the traffic between object instances, such that the overall throughput and network performance can be optimised. In this paper, we propose a new load balancing algorithm called "Node Status Algorithm" for DSA infrastructure applicable to electronic-based medical institutions. The simulation results illustrate that this proposed algorithm is able to outperform the benchmark load balancing algorithms-Random Algorithm and Shortest Queue Algorithm, especially under medium and heavily loaded network conditions, which are typical of the increasing bandwidth utilization and processing requirements at paperless hospitals and in the telemedicine environment...|$|E
40|$|TETRA {{is an open}} digital trunked {{professional}} mobile radio standard {{developed by}} European Telecommunications Standard Institute, which defines the various interfaces used in PMR system. Digital Exchange for TETRA (DXT) {{is the core of}} Airbus DS TETRA network and it handles signaling, switching and management functions. Switching commands generated during the call creates necessary switch table entries in the Voice Switching Unit in the DXT. Voice frames produced in a group call in TETRA network reaches the Voice Switching Unit. The voice frames are multiplied and modified according to the participants of the group call. The modified packets are then forwarded toward the recipients. In order to provide more virtualization and avoid custom hardware, the concept of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is used in voice switching. As a result a new system is developed, which performs the exact function of the current Voice Switching Unit. Replacement of current Voice Switching Unit with a combination of a SDN controller and a COTS SDN switch allows performing the switching of voice frames of the group <b>call.</b> <b>Switching</b> commands related to the group call are processed by the SDN application and necessary entries are made inside the SDN switch. As a result when voice frames reaches the SDN switch, the switch performs the table lookups. Upon finding the matching entry, the frames are multiplied and modified according to the details of the recipients. The concept of group tables in SDN switch helps in multiplying and modifying the packets. The modified packets are then forwarded towards the recipients, making the call a success...|$|E

Switching convert-ers use an inductor’s magnetic field to alternately store energy and release it to the load at a different voltage. With low losses, they are a good choice for high efficiency.
