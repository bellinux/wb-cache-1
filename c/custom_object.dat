Currently this includes information stealing capabilities and in the background, kernel drivers and injection tools. Part of this malware is written in unknown high-level programming language, dubbed [...] "Duqu framework". It is not C++, Python, Ada, Lua and many other checked languages. However, recent evidence suggests that Duqu may have been written in C with a <b>custom</b> <b>object</b> oriented framework and compiled in Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.|$|E

50|$|The {{game was}} built on an {{upgraded}} version of the Objectnaut engine, providing the player with several additional options when creating objects. As well as the adjective system that was introduced in Super Scribblenauts, players can now attach multiple objects to each other; for example, creating a dog with wheels. Furthermore, there are numerous properties that can be assigned to objects, such as movement and offensive capabilities. Players can also customize their objects with scaling and coloring tools, similar to another 5th Cell franchise, Drawn to Life. Customized objects can be named and saved - typing {{in the name of}} a saved <b>custom</b> <b>object</b> allows it to be spawned at any time. According to game designer Jeremiah Slaczka, the Wii U version of the game can store more than 900 custom objects. The 3DS version lacks this object editor, due to technological constraints.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} popular motion {{graphics}} tools is a particle system: a motion graphics technology that is used for generating multiple animated elements. This type of animation is commonly referred to as procedural animation. A particle system is available as a plug-in, as a stand-alone application, or is included as an integrated part of a motion graphics package. Particles are points in 3-D or 2-D space that can be represented by a wide variety of station and animated objects such as a ball of light, a video clip, or a selection of text, to name a few. The particles are generated by a particle emitter and can be emitted in small numbers or in the thousands, depending on the project. Among other things, a particle emitter can be {{in the form of a}} single point, a line, a grid, a plane or an object such as a box or sphere, although it can also make use a <b>custom</b> <b>object</b> to serve an emitter, such as a logo, which for example, can be exploded, melted, or transformed into blowing sand. A popular particle system for motion graphics is Particular by Trapcode.|$|E
40|$|In a {{distributed}} object system such as Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), legacy transport protocols {{used for}} communication limit the performance over high-speed networks. By {{making use of}} a lowlatency, high-bandwidth, and low overhead user-level networking architecture such as Virtual Interface (VI) Architecture, this performance bottleneck can be significantly reduced. Since user-level networking architectures provide low-level primitives, the challenge lies in integrating them into high-level applications. This requires a systematic approach. In this paper, a methodology to utilize VI Architecture to improve the performance of DCOM using <b>custom</b> <b>object</b> marshaling is developed. Initial experimental results demonstrate that the latencies of small messages in distributed object computing can be significantly reduced by this methodology...|$|E
40|$|Compared with {{artificial}} neural networks (ANNs), {{spiking neural networks}} (SNNs) are promising to explore the brain-like behaviors since the spikes could encode more spatio-temporal information. Although pre-training from ANN or direct training based on backpropagation (BP) makes the supervised training of SNNs possible, these methods only exploit the networks' spatial domain information {{which leads to the}} performance bottleneck and requires many complicated training skills. Another fundamental issue is that the spike activity is naturally non-differentiable which causes great difficulties in training SNNs. To this end, we build an iterative LIF model that is more friendly for gradient descent training. By simultaneously considering the layer-by-layer spatial domain (SD) and the timing-dependent temporal domain (TD) in the training phase, as well as an approximated derivative for the spike activity, we propose a spatio-temporal backpropagation (STBP) training framework without using any complicated technology. We achieve the best performance of multi-layered perceptron (MLP) compared with existing state-of-the-art algorithms over the static MNIST and the dynamic N-MNIST dataset as well as a <b>custom</b> <b>object</b> detection dataset. This work provides a new perspective to explore the high-performance SNNs for future brain-like computing paradigm with rich spatio-temporal dynamics...|$|E

40|$|The Royal Netherlands Army (RNLA) {{has been}} working on its second {{generation}} C 2 Information System since 2000. Its first generation Integrated Staff Information System (ISIS) that is currently deployed is based on ATCCIS specifications and uses the ATCCIS Replication Mechanism for database to database replication. For the next generation system, the C 2 Workstation, the goal was to incorporate NCW/NCO concepts in its architecture. This was translated into the requirement for a scaleable and robust Distributed Information Exchange Architecture that makes maximum use of COTS technology and runs on top of the IP based RNLA network Infrastructure TITAAN (Theatre Independent Tactical Army and Air force Network). Implementation of the new architecture is on track for an initial fielding by Q 1 2004. In this paper, several key characteristics of the C 2 WS architecture are described divided into four architectural layers: the Operational Layer, the Data Replication Layer, the Middleware Layer and the IP (Multicast) Layer. The RNLA has developed a <b>custom</b> <b>object</b> database and database replication mechanism that is expected to scale to 10. 000 or more databases and allows selective distribution and concurrent manipulation of data. The replication mechanism runs on top of a COTS Publish/Subscribe messaging middleware product. The middleware makes use of a reliable IP multicast protocol to allow efficient point-to-multipoint communication. Our conclusion is that the C 2 WS architecture meets many of the goals of Network Centric Operations. In the realisation of our architecture, we have identified several areas where COTS technology imposes limitations, for example in the area of security in Publish/Subscribe based communication and achieving fine grained selectivity of data distribution down to the IP-level. At the end of this paper we give an overview of technologies that we are evaluating to address these limitation...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} world-wide use of modern {{geospatial}} software to calculate maritime limits and boundaries both {{as part of}} work on the Article 76 of UNCLOS and for maintenance or delimitation of other limits. In the very dynamic and rapidly changing coastal environment, the territorial sea baseline model will evolve and thus impact dependent maritime limits. Juridical maritime limits and boundaries also {{play an important role}} in marine cadastres, defining the Sovereign rights and responsibilities in the territories they delimit. It is therefore essential that they be updated and managed efficiently in order to affect marine cadastres appropriately. Since new baseline models, maritime limits and boundaries must typically be published before they become official, it is a common practice to incorporate them in official nautical charts. In a common hydrographic production database environment, where they can be easily combined with hydrographic data, they become available and traceable for effective management. The resulting integration with recent and relevant marine information about the coastline, shipping lanes, marine protected areas and territorial sea baselines also allows fast updating of relevant nautical charts. The use of a hydrographic production database offers interesting advantages in the management and updating of marine boundaries. The transfer of existing geospatial maritime limits and boundaries data to a hydrographic database environment does require that a compatible data model be adopted. One international standard, S- 57, offers distinct benefits to marine data managers. For instance, new <b>custom</b> <b>object</b> and attribute acronyms may be added to allow better flexibility and management of legal maritime data. For variants on marine cadastre applications, the catalog of object and attribute acronyms can also be expanded. This paper examines the possibilities of a hydrographic production database solution to allow more effective management of maritime limits and boundaries. ...|$|E
