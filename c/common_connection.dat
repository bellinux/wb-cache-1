5|$|Wright met Darwin in {{the early}} 1760s, {{probably}} through their <b>common</b> <b>connection</b> of John Whitehurst, first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when {{he stayed in the}} Darwin household for a week. The energy and vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary (Polly) Darwin impressed Wright. In the 1980s Eric Evans (National Gallery) suggested that Darwin is the figure in the left foreground who holds a watch. As this composed timekeeper is not consistent with Darwin's flamboyant character, {{it is more likely that}} this is Dr William Small. The attention to timekeeping fits with Dr Small's role as the social secretary for the Lunar circle. Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765, consistent with this being a meeting in 1767. The profile and wig of this figure are consistent with a contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle.|$|E

25|$|Anti-Russian {{sentiment}} in Croatia has been historically low due to <b>common</b> <b>connection,</b> such as Slavic heritage and Russia's support for Croatian independence. However, {{at the end}} of XIX century, there had been a serious campaign against Orthodox Christianity formed by Catholic Croatian group which aimed to the Serbs. However, as Orthodox Christianity is also Russia's main religion, it had resulted with the growth of anti-Russian sentiment among Croats. It was the reason Russia and Croatia went on different sides in both World Wars and the Yugoslav War.|$|E

By 1860 {{the company}} had five seagoing vessels, among them the Kate, the Cecil and the Herald, making shipping runs from Liverpool to New York and Charleston, and back again. When the southern states seceded from the Union, it {{opened the door to}} even greater business, and in little time nearly all of their business was with the C.S.A.

500|$|Borscht is {{associated}} with and claimed by several ethnic groups, especially Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews, as their own national or ethnic dish and cultural icon. Such claims are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as the soup's history predates the emergence in Eastern Europe of modern nation states with their ever-shifting borders. Borscht, {{in the words of}} Burlakoff, [...] "is perfectly suited to a global culture." [...] He describes it as [...] "a global phenomenon", in which [...] "local variants are so numerous and diverse that it is hard sometimes for a non-specialist to grasp that any single example of it is something that is part of a unified tradition." [...] In his view, borscht [...] "is an almost perfect example of... 'glocalization' – a phenomenon that is global in distribution but reflective of local needs and ways in its variants and adaptation;... a highly localized product that became globalized, and in the process adapted to conditions other than the original ones." [...] However, according to Irina Perianova, a Russian linguist and anthropologist, [...] "people tend to be very proprietal about their food and proud of it." [...] Perianova offers competing Russian and Ukrainian views on the origin and ingredients of borscht as an example of [...] "a <b>common</b> <b>connection</b> between culinary and territorial claims", which results in the culinary area turning into [...] "a battlefield generating and proliferating all kinds of myths." ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the work}} is to {{integrate}} the information modulation of the inter-relations between EEG scalp measurements of two brain states in a connectivity graph. We present a sparse differential connectivity graph (SDCG) to distinguish the effectively modulated connections between epileptiform and non-epileptiform states of the brain from all the <b>common</b> <b>connections</b> created by noise, artifact, unwanted background activities and their related volume conduction effect. The proposed method is applied on real epileptic EEG data. Clustering the extracted features from SDCG may present valuable information about the epileptiform focus and their relations...|$|R
50|$|Computer {{models have}} been {{developed}} to investigate the balance between the social aspects of diffusion and perceived intrinsic benefit to the individuals. When the effect of each individual node was analyzed along with its influence over the entire network, the expected level of adoption was seen to depend on the number of initial adopters and the structure and properties of the network. Two factors in particular emerged as important to successful spread of the innovation: The number of connections of nodes with their neighbors, and the presence of a high degree of <b>common</b> <b>connections</b> in the network (quantified by the clustering coefficient).|$|R

2500|$|The {{spelling}} [...] is now rare {{in everyday}} British usage, its use lessening as knowledge of Latin lessens, {{and it is}} not used at all in the US: the more <b>common</b> <b>connection</b> has become the standard worldwide. According to the Oxford English Dictionary the older spelling is more etymologically conservative, since the original Latin word had -xio-. The American usage comes from Webster, who abandoned -xion in favour of -ction by analogy with verbs like connect. Connexion was still the house style of The Times of London until the 1980s and was still used by the British Post Office for its telephone services in the 1970s, but had by then been overtaken by connection in regular usage (for example, in more popular newspapers).|$|E

He found that community cohesion was simply [...] "a critique of particular forms of multiculturalism policy formation and operation that have focused exclusively on the needs, identities and concerns of each separate ethnic group without consideration of relations, links and experiences shared between those groups"(Thomas, 2011 p. 91). Thomas also found that, rather than promote assimilation, [...] "community cohesion practice accepts and works with distinct ethnic and social identities, whilst augmenting them with overarching identities based on <b>common</b> <b>connections,</b> needs and experiences" [...] (Thomas, 2011 p. 168).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{approach}} to distinguish between causal <b>connections</b> and <b>common</b> input <b>connections</b> among nodes in a network. By modeling how the activity of a node depends on its own recent history, we demonstrate how this history dependence predicts different patterns of activity depending {{on the nature of}} the network connectivity. In particular, a causal connection between a pair of observed nodes can be distinguished from <b>common</b> input <b>connections</b> that originate from nodes whose activity remains unobserved. This work builds on previous results where this same distinction was made based on modeling how the activity of a node depends on measured external variables such as stimuli. The results have a potentially broad range of application as the analysis can be based on a fairly generic class of models...|$|R
