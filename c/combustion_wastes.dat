40|$|Abstract—Amphibian malformations have {{recently}} received much {{attention from the}} scientific community, but few studies have provided evidence linking environmental pollution to larval amphibian malformations in the field. We document an increased incidence of axial malformations in bullfrog larvae (Rana catesbeiana) inhabiting two sites contaminated with coal <b>combustion</b> <b>wastes.</b> In the polluted sites, 18 and 37 % of larvae exhibited lateral curvatures of the spine, whereas zero and 4 % of larvae from two reference sites had similar malformations. Larvae from the most heavily polluted site had significantly higher tissue concen-trations of potentially toxic trace elements, including As, Cd, Se, Cu, Cr, and V, compared with conspecifics from the reference sites. In addition, malformed larvae from the most contaminated site had decreased swimming speeds {{compared with those of}} normal larvae from the same site. We hypothesize that the complex mixture of contaminants produced by coal combustion is responsible for the high incidence of malformations and associated effects on swimming performance.

40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{the evaluation of}} the reclamation efficiencyon coal <b>combustion</b> <b>waste</b> deposits fertilized with composts and sewage sludge. Based on multiannual studies, the dynamics of changes in vegetation in the performed experiment have been shown. The firstphase of the experiment concerning the reclamation efficiencyof the employed fertilizers was carried out from 2006 to 2007. The second phase was carried out between 2011 and 2012. In order to show a broader spectrum of dynamics of changes in vegetation, the floristicobservation was repeated in 2013 and this paper is the presentation of its outcome. Based on the observation (2011 – 2013) and its results it was found that apart from plants cultivated in experimental containers also a self-sown florahas had a significantcontribution in shap-ing the vegetation cover. The results of floristic and ecological research have proven that composts and sewage sludge constitute a favorable environment for the development of spontaneous vegetation cover on coal <b>combustion</b> <b>waste</b> deposits. Based on {{the evaluation of the}} vegetation cover level in particular models it was shown that models with Complex composts (kC) and Radiowo ones (kRa) as well as the model with sewage sludge have pre-sented the highest reclamation efficienc.

40|$|In {{the model}} experiment, an {{assessment}} of the role of plants in the reclamation of the bed of <b>combustion</b> <b>waste</b> from coal-based power plants fertilised with compost and sewage sludge. The bed of <b>combustion</b> <b>waste</b> was stored in cylindrical containers with a diameter of 80 cm (0. 5 m 2 of surface) and the height of 100 cm. The first stage of the experiment was carried out in 2006 – 2007. Then the bed was fertilised with four types of compost and sewage sludge, and then seeded with four species of grasses and white mustard. The second stage was undertaken in 2011 – 2013. In 2011, mixture of four species of grasses and white mustard was seeded on the same bed. It was assumed that the continuation of research in the second stage, whose results of are presented in this paper, will show a broader spectrum of vegetation changes, what will accurately track the process of biological reclamation of the bed of <b>combustion</b> <b>waste.</b> The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of reclamation in the experiment, based on the percentage estimates of the coverage of species and crop yields. During the three-year (second stage) experiment 78 species of self-seeding plants belonging to 19 taxa in the rank of families and 11 syntaxonomic groups were recorded. The most numerous were the families: aster family, grass family, papilionaceous family, goosefoot family and cabbage family. Among the syntaxonomic groups the dominating species belonged to the class Stellarietea mediae, Molinio-Arrhenatheretea and Artemisietea vulgaris. Among the forms of life hemicryptophyte and therophytes were the most represented. Highest total yields of plants were found in model containers with Complex compost and Radiowo compost and the model of sewage sludge. Based on the estimated models in each degree of coverage of species and crop yield, the highest reclamation efficiency was demonstrated in the models of reclamation of composts Complex and Radiowo, as well as in the model of sewage sludge.
