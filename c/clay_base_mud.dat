The viscosity values of the mud samples from the three oils varied considerably.

Two types of muds that are normally used in drilling operation are water <b>based</b> <b>muds</b> and oil <b>based</b> <b>muds</b> (diesel and mineral oil).

40|$|Abstract. Shale gas {{nowadays}} is {{an important}} source of unconventional gas. The limited conventional gas supply makes the unconventional sources as a new source of gas. In this research, the aim is to design a mud formulation that can carry out essential functions of mud for shale gas drilling. Commonly for shale gas drilling, water <b>based</b> <b>mud</b> is used. However, water <b>based</b> <b>mud</b> is ineffective when dealing with water-sensitive shale. The alternative way to deal with this type of shale is using synthetic-based mud (SBM) or oil-based mud (OBM). OBM is an effective mud while drilling well. However, it is toxic and gives negative impact to environment. SBM somehow is more environmental friendly compared to oil based and ester is one of the synthetic based fluids. In order to prove this statement, a toxicity test was carried out to investigate the impact of ester <b>based</b> <b>mud</b> on selected marine life. The results of the test were compared with past research results. The ester use in this research is methyl-ester C 12 -C 14 derived from palm oil and the mud was formulated at different oil-water ratios which are 70 / 30, 80 / 20 and 90 / 10, respectively and the best rheological performance can be seen at 80 / 20 oil-water ratio. Then, the performance of this mud had been compared to other types of mud which are sarapar-based and WBM. The findings revealed that the rheological performance of ester <b>based</b> <b>mud</b> is comparable with common <b>based</b> <b>mud</b> used for shale gas drilling. Apart from that, it is less toxic than other <b>based</b> <b>mud</b> which can maintain 60 % prawn’s survival even after 96 hours exposure in 100, 000 ppm of mud concentration in artificial seawater...|$|R

Recently, New mud additives are been developed to enhance the rheology of water <b>based</b> <b>mud</b> to deliver the same characteristics and reliability of an oil <b>based</b> <b>mud</b> when considering the Niger Delta geology. Due to the challenges with Water <b>Based</b> <b>Mud</b> in respect to chemistry and suitability, Oil <b>Based</b> <b>Mud</b> (OBM) has become the main type of drilling fluid in deeper sections during drilling campaign in the Niger Delta. But the use of OBM as come with some challenges that has necessitated the further {{research and development of}} Water <b>Based</b> <b>Mud</b> rheology that can deliver the same results as OBM. Some of the challenges {{associated with the use of}} OBM include but not limited to high cost and management, contamination of OBM in the storage site during drilling activities, logistics complexity, environmental impact from spills and disposal, and impact on well productivity and reservoir management. In countries such as Ghana, Columbia, Oman, Mexico, Enhanced WBM mud has been used and is still being used in drilling to deep depths (8000 ft- 10000 ft) TVD in formations with similar geology with that of the Niger Delta. Sample wells will be reviewed from one of these regions for the project and they will be used to show the evolving new technologies and techniques in WBM rheology formulation. This study is channeled to label the engineered properties of the mud, mud composition, its effects on drilling efficiency and well productivity, challenges encountered, the concept for an enhancement, added advantage in comparison to OBM, comparative cost advantage. It was discovered that Enhanced WBM has an added advantage hence leading to a reduction in pollution trends in the Niger Delta and cost effectiveness.
