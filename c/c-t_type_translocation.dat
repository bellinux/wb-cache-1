40|$|The {{cytogenetic}} {{types of}} Down syndrome, {{which is a}} widespread disease and {{the most common cause}} of mental retardation among live-borne babies, vary according to the risk of recurrance and has been a guide for the genetic counseling. This study was conducted between January 1996 and December 2006 in our department. The study included 584 patients with clinical diagnosis of Down syndrome. There were 232 (39. 7 %) female and 352 (60. 3 %) male patients. The aim of the study was to investigate the cytogenetic types and its incidence in this group of patients. By using peripheral blood culture method for cytogenetic analysis, it was found that 128 cases (21. 9 %) had normal karyotypes, whereas 456 (% 78. 1) cases had karyotype of Down syndrome. There was regular type in 432 patients (% 94. 7), <b>translocation</b> <b>type</b> in 14 (% 3. 1) [8 t(14; 21), 6 t(21; 21) ], mosaic type in 4 (% 0. 9), and 6 patients (% 1. 3) associated with inv(9) with regular type karyotype in patients with Down syndrome. Four of 14 / 21 <b>type</b> of <b>translocations</b> were familial (50. 0 %) and other 14 / 21 and 21 / 21 <b>types</b> <b>translocations</b> were found to be de novo.

40|$|This report {{reviews the}} {{available}} information concerning translocations, as background {{for a future}} policy statement to be drawn up by the statutory UK conservation agencies (the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, English Nature, Scottish Natural Heritage, the Countryside Council for Wales and the Department of the Environment, Northern Ireland). Translocations of species for conservation reasons in the UK include reintroduction, population supplementation, sowing and planting for habitat restoration, and relocation of populations and of species assemblages. Non-conservation translocations for commercial, amenity and aesthetic reasons are carried out using native and non-native species, and genetically modified organisms. Precise definitions of the different <b>types</b> of <b>translocation</b> are given, {{as well as other}} important terms used in the review. Four subject areas are covered in separate chapters: species native to the UK, species not native to the UK, genetically modified organisms, and species assemblages. The <b>types</b> of <b>translocations</b> carried out within the subject area are reviewed and representative case studies are presented. A set of definitions of genetic, species and ecosystem biodiversity are determined, and are used as a framework with which to assess the environmental effects of each <b>type</b> of <b>translocation.</b> For all <b>types</b> of <b>translocation,</b> the adverse effects on biodiversity are assessed using the case studies. For conservation translocations, the factors affecting the success and benefits of the translocation are determined as well. Existing policies and guidelines of UK and international organisations relating to each <b>type</b> of <b>translocation</b> are summarised and assessed {{in the light of the}} reviews of case studies. UK and European legislation and international conventions relevant to translocations in the UK are also summarised and possible improvements are suggested which would allow better regulation and the amelioration of adverse effects on biodiversity. While certain <b>types</b> of <b>translocation</b> are well regulated in the UK (e. g. GMO release, release of non-resident alien animals), others poorly covered by legislative controls are translocation of most native species, release of most alien plants or animals resident in the UK and control of problem alien species. Some areas require a revision or coordination of the approach to the regulatory process: GMO releases, translocation of species assemblages, release of non-native species. Areas requiring further research are highlighted, and these illustrate a need for more coordinated and structured monitoring and databasing of current and future translocations. A major aspect of any translocation must be consideration of the maximum benefit to biodiversity and/or the minimum risk of adverse impacts. It is recommended that project planning and risk and 'benefits' assessment procedures should be carried out before any translocation takes place. It is recommended that the formulation of new policy and guidelines by the statutory conservation agencies should involve other UK and international organisations involved in carrying out, advising on, or licensing translocations. ...|$|R
50|$|A Robertsonian <b>translocation</b> is a <b>type</b> of <b>translocation</b> {{involving}} two homologous (paired) or non-homologous chromosomes (i.e. {{two different}} chromosomes, not {{belonging to a}} homologous pair). A feature of chromosomes that are commonly found to undergo such translocations is that they possess an acrocentric centromere, partitioning the chromosome into a large arm containing {{the vast majority of}} its genes, and a short arm with a much smaller proportion of genetic content. During a Robertsonian translocation, the participating chromosomes break at their centromeres and the long arms fuse to form a single, large chromosome with a single centromere. The short arms also join to form a smaller reciprocal product, which typically contains only nonessential genes also present elsewhere in the genome, and is usually lost within a few cell divisions. This <b>type</b> of <b>translocation</b> is cytologically visible, and can reduce chromosome number (from 23 to 22 pairs, in humans) if the smaller chromosome that results from a translocation is lost in the process of future cellular divisions. However, the smaller chromosome lost may carry so few genes (which are, in any case, also present elsewhere in the genome) that it can be lost without an ill effect to the individual.|$|R
40|$|The {{flagellum}} {{is believed}} to be the common ancestor of all type III secretion systems (TTSSs). In Yersinia enterocolitica, expression of the flagellar TTSS and the Ysc (Yop secretion) TTSS are inversely regulated. We therefore hypothesized that the Ysc TTSS may adopt flagellar motor components in order to use the pathogenicity-related translocon in a drill-like manner. As a prerequisite for this hypothesis, we first tested a requirement for the proton motive force by both systems using the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Motility as well as type III-dependent secretion of Yop proteins was inhibited by CCCP. We deleted motAB, which resulted in an immotile phenotype. This mutant, however, secreted amounts of Yops to the supernatant comparable to those of the wild <b>type.</b> <b>Translocation</b> of Yops into host cells was also not affected by the motAB deletion. Virulence of the mutant was comparable to that of the wild type in the mouse oral infection model. Thus, the hypothesis that the Ysc TTSS might adopt flagellar motor components was not confirmed. The finding that, in addition to consumption of ATP, Ysc TTSS requires the proton motive force is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The bsa {{locus of}} Burkholderia pseudomallei encodes several {{proteins}} that are {{components of the}} type III secretion system (TTSS). BipC was postulated {{as one of the}} TTSS- 3 effector proteins, but its role in the patho-genesis of B. pseudomallei infection is not well understood. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine its role(s) in the virulence of B. pseudomallei pathogenesis. Methods. A bipC TTSS- 3 –deficient strain of B. pseudomallei and complemented strains were generated to assess the role of BipC as a <b>type</b> III <b>translocation</b> apparatus. Human cell lines and a mouse model of melioidosis were used for in vitro and in vivo assays, respectively. Results. A significant 2 -fold reduction was demonstrated in the percentage of adherence, invasion, intracellular survival, and phagosomal escape of the bipC mutant. Interestingly, microscopic studies have shown that BipC was capable of delayed B. pseudomallei actin-based motility. The virulence of the mutant strain in a murine model of melioidosis demonstrated that the bipC mutant was less virulent, compared with the wild type. Conclusion. The results suggested that BipC possesses virulence determinants that play significant roles in host cell invasion and immune evasion. Keywords.

They are also capable of eliciting spontaneously humoral and cellular immune responses in cancer patients, and are potentially useful targets in cancer vaccine-based immunotherapy. SSX1, SSX2 and SSX4 genes {{have been involved in the}} t(X;18) chromosomal translocation characteristically found in all synovial sarcomas. This gene appears not to be involved in this <b>type</b> of <b>translocation.</b> Two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.|$|R
50|$|Lastly, {{the third}} <b>type</b> of <b>{{translocation}}</b> is re-stocking. Re-stocking is the translocation of an organism {{into the wild}} into an area where it is already present. Re-stocking is considered as a conservation strategy where populations have dropped below critical levels and species recovery is questionable due to slow reproductive rates or inbreeding. The World Conservation Union recommends that re-stocking only occur when the causes of population decline have been removed, the area {{has the capacity to}} sustain the desired population, and individuals are of the same race as the population into which they are released but not from genetically impoverished or cloned stock.|$|R
50|$|The {{second of}} the three <b>types</b> of <b>translocation</b> is re-introduction. Re-introduction is the {{deliberate}} or accidental translocation of a species into the wild in areas where it was indigenous at some point, but no longer at the present. Re-introduction {{is used as a}} wildlife management tool for the restoration of an original habitat when it has become altered or species have become extinct due to over-collecting, over-harvesting, human persecution, or habitat deterioration. An example of a successful translocation was the one performed with the plant Narcissus cavanillesii to prevent its flooding due to the construction of a dam.|$|R
5000|$|Robertsonian <b>translocation</b> is a <b>type</b> of <b>translocation</b> {{caused by}} breaks {{at or near}} the centromeres of two {{acrocentric}} chromosomes.

40|$|Polyploidization {{is a major}} {{evolutionary}} process. Approximately 70 – 75 % {{species of}} Triticeae (Poaceae) are polyploids, involving 23 genomes.

L. Yang et al. (2 n = 6 x = 42, StStPPYY), collected from different environments, were studied using genome in situ hybridization (GISH).

40|$|Upon {{infection}} of mammalian cells, enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O 157 :H 7 utilizes a type III secretion system to translocate the effectors Tir and EspF(U) (aka TccP) that trigger {{the formation of}} F-actin-rich 2 ̆ 7 pedestals 2 ̆ 7 beneath bound bacteria. EspF(U) is localized to the plasma membrane by Tir and binds the nucleation-promoting factor N-WASP, which in turn activates the Arp 2 / 3 actin assembly complex. Although N-WASP {{has been shown to}} be required for EHEC pedestal formation, the precise steps in the process that it influences have not been determined. We found that N-WASP and actin assembly promote EHEC-mediated translocation of Tir and EspF(U) into mammalian host cells. When we utilized the related pathogen enteropathogenic E. coli to enhance <b>type</b> III <b>translocation</b> of EHEC Tir and EspF(U), we found surprisingly that actin pedestals were generated on N-WASP-deficient cells. Similar to pedestal formation on wild type cells, Tir and EspF(U) were the only bacterial effectors required for pedestal formation, and the EspF(U) sequences required to interact with N-WASP were found to also be essential to stimulate this alternate actin assembly pathway. In the absence of N-WASP, the Arp 2 / 3 complex was both recruited to sites of bacterial attachment and required for actin assembly. Our results indicate that actin assembly facilitates <b>type</b> III <b>translocation,</b> and reveal that EspF(U), presumably by recruiting an alternate host factor that can signal to the Arp 2 / 3 complex, exhibits remarkable versatility in its strategies for stimulating actin polymerization...|$|R

40|$|Robertsonian translocations are {{the most}} common {{chromosomal}} rearrangements in humans. The vast ma-jority of the ten possible nonhomologous <b>types</b> of Rob-ertsonian <b>translocations</b> ascertained are rob(13 q 14 q) and rob(14 q 21 q). Recombination between homologous sequences on nonhomologous chromosomes has been proposed as a mechanism leading to the preferen-tial formation of rob(13 q 14 q) and rob(14 q 21 q). However, little evidence exists to indicate whether the remaining less common Robertsonian translocations form through a similar mechanism. To better elucidate the mechanisms involved in Robertsonian translocation formation, we have used fluorescence in situ hybridiza-tion to localize the breakpoints in 56 nonhomologous Robertsonian translocations. This study revealed high-ly variable locations of breakpoints in seven types of the less common Robertsonians, while nearly all rob(13 q 14 q) and rob(14 q 21 q) analyzed displayed break-points in the same locations. Therefore, this study pro-vides direct evidence that rob(13 q 14 q) and rob(14 q 21 q) form through a specific mechanism, possibly involving homologous recombination, which is distinct from the mechanism(s) that contributes to the formation of the remaining <b>types</b> of Robertsonian <b>translocations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The t(8; 14) MYC/IGH {{breakpoint}} is {{the hallmark}} translocation of human Burkitt lymphoma (BL).

During CSR in normal germinal center B cells, DNA double-stranded breaks are introduced in Smu and one of the downstream switch regions (Sgamma, Salpha, or Sepsilon) that are juxtaposed and ligated to form the switch junction, with deletion of the intervening DNA. In contrast, aberrant switch recombination in BL exclusively involves only one switch region, resulting in a perfect reciprocal translocation.

In 81 of the translocations, the breakpoints were at 14 q 11 and either 7 q 34 (type I) or 7 p 13 (type II) : <b>type</b> I <b>translocations</b> occurred in 42 patients, and type II, in 39. The two other translocations had different breakpoints: one was t(7; 14) (q 11;q 32), {{and the other was}} t(7; 14) (p 13;q 32). All type I and <b>type</b> II <b>translocations</b> occurred in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocyte cultures; their combined incidence was 4. 88 X 10 (- 4) per metaphase (81 of 165, 991 metaphases) in such cultures. No type I or II translocation was found among 6, 713 fibroblast metaphases, 33, 463 amniocyte metaphases, or 68, 972 bone marrow and unstimulated peripheral blood metaphases. One variant 7; 14 translocation occurred in a phytohemagglutinin-stimulated culture, and the other occurred in a fibroblast culture. We did not find a correlation of sporadic 7; 14 translocations with any month or season of the year or with patient age or sex. Of the 83 patients, 78 had various clinical disorders, three had ataxia-telangiectasia, one was a normal control, and one was an artificial insemination donor. Follow-up studies on 64 (77 %) patients indicate that, to date, none have developed any malignant process subsequent to chromosome analysis. Except for ataxia-telangiectasia, the occurrence of types I and II translocations in lymphocyte cultures may have little, if any, clinical significance.

40|$|Genome instability, {{associated}} with chromosome breakage syndromes and most human cancers, is still poorly understood. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, numerous genes with {{roles in the}} preservation of genome integrity have been identified. DNA-damage-checkpoint-deficient yeast cells that lack Sgs 1, a RecQ-like DNA helicase related to the human Bloom 2 ̆ 7 s-syndrome-associated helicase BLM, show an increased rate of genome instability, and we have previously shown that they accumulate recurring chromosomal translocations between three similar genes, CAN 1, LYP 1 and ALP 1. Here, the chromosomal location, copy number and sequence similarity of the translocation targets ALP 1 and LYP 1 were altered to gain insight into the formation of complex translocations. Among 844 clones with chromosomal rearrangements, 93 with various types of simple and complex translocations involving CAN 1, LYP 1 and ALP 1 were identified. Breakpoint sequencing and mapping showed that the formation of complex <b>translocation</b> <b>types</b> is strictly dependent on {{the location of the}} initiating DNA break and revealed that complex translocations arise via a combination of interchromosomal translocation and template-switching, as well as from unstable dicentric intermediates. Template-switching occurred between sequences on the same chromosome, but was inhibited if the genes were transferred to different chromosomes. Unstable dicentric translocations continuously gave rise to clones with multiple translocations in various combinations, reminiscent of intratumor heterogeneity in human cancers. Base substitutions and evidence of DNA slippage near rearrangement breakpoints revealed that translocation formation can be accompanied by point mutations, and their presence in different <b>translocation</b> <b>types</b> within the same clone provides evidence that some of the different <b>translocation</b> <b>types</b> are derived from each other rather than being formed de novo.

40|$|The {{southern}} brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) {{has undergone}} significant range contractions since European settlement, {{and it is}} now considered "Endangered" throughout south-eastern mainland Australia. This species currently has a highly fragmented distribution inhabiting a mosaic of habitats. This project uses mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite data to determine levels of genetic diversity, population structure and evolutionary history, which can aid wildlife managers in setting priorities and determining management strategies. Analyses of genetic diversity revealed low levels of mtDNA variability (mean h= 50. 42 %, π= 0. 76 %) and divergence (mean dA= 0. 29 %) across all regions investigated, and was among the lowest recorded for marsupials. These data indicate a relatively small female effective population size, which is most likely a consequence of a large-scale population contraction and subsequent expansion occurring in pre-history (mismatch distribution analysis, SSD P-value= 0. 12). Individuals from the Sydney region experienced significant reductions in microsatellite diversity (A= 3. 8, HE= 0. 565), with the Garigal National Park (NP) population exhibiting "genetic reduction signatures" indicating a recent population bottleneck. Population differentiation analysis revealed significant genetic division amongst I. obesulus individuals from Sydney, East Gippsland and Mt Gambier regions (theta= 0. 176 – 0. 271), but could not separate the two Sydney populations (Ku-ring-gai NP and Garigal NP). Based on these data and habitat <b>type,</b> <b>translocations</b> could readily be made between the two Sydney populations, but not between the others. Phylogenetic comparisons between I. obesulus and I. auratus show little support for current Isoodon taxonomy, consistent with the findings of Pope et al. 2001.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Antisense {{oligonucleotide}} (AON) -mediated exon skipping is {{a powerful}} tool to manipulate gene expression. In the present study we investigated the potential of exon skipping by local injection in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) of the mouse brain. As proof of principle we targeted the splicing of steroid receptor coactivator- 1 (SRC- 1), a protein involved in nuclear receptor function. This nuclear receptor coregulator exists in two splice variants (SRC- 1 a and SRC- 1 e) which display differential distribution and opposing activities in the brain, and whose mRNAs differ in a single SRC- 1 e specific exon. METHODS: For proof of principle of feasibility, we used immunofluorescent stainings to study uptake by different cell <b>types,</b> <b>translocation</b> to the nucleus and potential immunostimulatory effects at different time points after a local injection in the CeA of the mouse brain of a control AON targeting human dystrophin with no targets in the murine brain. To evaluate efficacy we designed an AON targeting the SRC- 1 e-specific exon and with qPCR analysis we measured the expression ratio of the two splice variants. RESULTS: We found that AONs were taken up by corticotropin releasing hormone expressing neurons and other cells in the CeA, and translocated into the cell nucleus. Immune responses after AON injection were comparable to those after sterile saline injection. A successful shift of the naturally occurring SRC- 1 a:SRC- 1 e expression ratio in favor of SRC- 1 a was observed, without changes in total SRC- 1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a proof of concept for local neuropharmacological use of exon skipping by manipulating the expression ratio of the two splice variants of SRC- 1, which {{may be used to}} study nuclear receptor function in specific brain circuits. We established that exon skipping after local injection in the brain is a versatile and useful tool for the manipulation of splice variants for numerous genes that are relevant for brain function...|$|R

Here we generated and analyzed primary infant ALL expression profiles (n = 73) typified by translocations t(4; 11), t(11; 19), and t(9; 11), or the absence of MLL translocations. Our data show that MLL germline infant ALL specifies a gene expression pattern that is different from both MLL-rearranged infantALL and pediatric precursor B-ALL. Moreover, we demonstrate that, apart from a fundamental signature shared by all MLL-rearranged infant ALL samples, each <b>type</b> of MLL <b>translocation</b> is associated with a translocation-specific gene expression signature. Finally, we show the existence of 2 distinct subgroups among t(4; 11) -positive infant ALL cases characterized by the absence or presence of HOXA expression, and that patients lacking HOXA expression are at extreme high risk of disease relapse. These gene expression profiles should provide important novel insights in the complex biology of MLL-rearranged infant ALL and boost our progress in finding novel therapeutic solutions...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} framework is presented {{which provides a}} quantitative analysis of radiation induced translocations between the ab 1 oncogene on CH 9 q 34 and a breakpoint cluster region, bcr, on CH 22 q 11. Such translocations are associated frequently with chronic myelogenous leukemia. The theory {{is based on the}} assumption that incorrect or unfaithful rejoining of initial double strand breaks produced concurrently within the 200 kbp intron region upstream of the second abl exon, and the 16. 5 kbp region between bcr exon 2 and exon 6 interact with each other, resulting in a fusion gene. for an x-ray dose of 100 Gy, there is good agreement between the theoretical estimate and the one available experimental result. The theory has been extended to provide dose response curves for these <b>types</b> of <b>translocations.</b> These curves are quadratic at low doses and become linear at high doses...|$|R
40|$|Background: Legionella pneumophila is an {{intracellular}} {{bacterial pathogen}} that invades and replicates within alveolar macrophages through injection of, 300 effector proteins by its Dot/Icm <b>type</b> IV <b>translocation</b> apparatus. The bona fide F-box protein, AnkB, is a nutritional virulence effector that triggers macrophages {{to generate a}} surplus of amino acids, which is essential for intravacuolar proliferation. Therefore, the ankB mutant represents a novel genetic tool to determine the transcriptional response of human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) to actively replicating L. pneumophila. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we utilized total human gene microarrays to determine the global transcriptional response of hMDMs to infection by wild type or the ankB mutant of L. pneumophila. The transcriptomes of hMDMs infected with either actively proliferating wild type or non-replicative ankB mutant bacteria were remarkably similar. The transcriptome of infected hMDMs was predominated by up-regulation of inflammatory pathways (IL- 10 anti-inflammatory, interferon signalin...|$|R
40|$|Twitching motility, a flagella-independent <b>type</b> of <b>translocation</b> of {{bacteria}} over moist surfaces, requires {{an array of}} proteins, including FimV. To investigate the role of this protein in twitching motility in Legionella pneumophila, we have generated a knockout mutant of fimV and characterized its phenotypic effects. In addition to a major reduction in twitching motility, deletion of the fimV gene caused {{a number of other}} phenotypic effects including decreased protective pigment formation, and it also affected cell morphology. Since fimV contains a variable number of tandem repeats, which can vary according to the origin of a given strain, we have examined the importance of this variability found within the coding region of this gene. By complementing the knockout strain with constructs containing a different number of this tandem repeat, {{we have been able to}} also show that repeat copy number is important in the functioning of this gene. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which macromolecules are translocated through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is little understood. However, recent measurements of nuclear transport in permeabilized cells showed that molecules binding to phenylalanine-glycine-rich repeats (FG repeats) in NPC proteins were translocated much faster through the NPC than molecules not interacting with FG repeats. We have studied that substrate preference of the NPC in isolated oocyte nuclei and purified nuclear envelopes by optical single transporter recording. NTF 2, the transport receptor of RanGDP, was exported ∼ 30 times faster than green fluorescent protein, an inert molecule of approximately the same size. The data confirm that restricted diffusion of inert molecules and facilitated transport of FG-repeat binding proteins are basic <b>types</b> of <b>translocation</b> through the NPC, demonstrating that the functional integrity of the NPC can be conserved in isolated nuclei and nuclear envelopes and thus opening new avenues {{to the analysis of}} nucleocytoplasmic transport...|$|R
