It is the oldest branch library {{in the city and}} was the first of six branch libraries built with a $210,000 grant from Andrew Carnegie. [...] When the library opened, the 2,000 new books which were ready for circulation did not come close to filling the shelves that were planned to accommodate 16,000 volumes. [...] A history of the branch's early years describes the opening this way:"On March 1, 1913, the Vermont Square Branch, the first of the Carnegie branch libraries built in Los Angeles, was opened to the public. ... At six o'clock the doors were opened and hundreds of enthusiastic men, women and children crowded in. It had been planned to have the program in the auditorium but since the crowd made this impossible, the speakers sought refuge within the <b>charging</b> <b>desk</b> where they spoke from an improvised platform. ... The newness of the library, furniture and books were a real luxury to us who had been used to the gloomy, rented store buildings but there was one crumpled rose leaf which marred our serenity of spirit. There was no cork carpet on the floors and the noise of the steel tipped chairs on the cement was terrific." ...|$|E
