40|$|The Encyclopedia of <b>Color</b> Science <b>and</b> Technology {{provides}} an authoritative single source for understanding and applying {{the concepts of}} color to all fields of science and technology, including artistic and historical aspects of color. Many topics are discussed in this timely reference, including {{an introduction to the}} science of <b>color,</b> <b>and</b> entries on the physics, chemistry <b>and</b> perception of <b>color.</b> Color is described as it relates to optical phenomena of <b>color</b> <b>and</b> continues on through colorants and materials used to modulate <b>color</b> <b>and</b> also to human vision of color. The measurement of color is provided as is colorimetry, color spaces, color difference metrics, color appearance models, <b>color</b> order systems <b>and</b> cognitive <b>color.</b> Other topics discussed include industrial color, color imaging, capturing <b>color,</b> displaying <b>color</b> <b>and</b> printing <b>color.</b> Descriptions of color encodings, color management, processing <b>color</b> <b>and</b> applications relating to color synthesis for computer graphics are included in this work. The Encyclopedia also delves into color as it applies to other domains such as art and design – ie – color design, color harmony, <b>color</b> palettes, <b>color</b> <b>and</b> accessibility, researching <b>color</b> deficiency, <b>and</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> data visualization.

5|$|Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due {{to their}} faintness, {{there have been a}} number of successes in {{determining}} their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts of methane ice. For the smaller objects, only <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> in some cases the albedos have been determined. These objects largely fall into two classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference in <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these objects, with the surfaces of those that formed far enough from the Sun to retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} <b>color</b> <b>and</b> infrared stereo approaches to pedestrian detection. We design a four camera experimental testbed consisting of two <b>color</b> <b>and</b> two infrared cameras that allows for synchronous capture and direct frame-by-frame comparison of pedestrian detection approaches. We incorporate this four camera system in a test vehicle and conduct comparative experiments of stereo-based approaches to obstacle detection using <b>color</b> <b>and</b> infrared imagery. A detailed analysis of these experiments shows the robustness of both <b>color</b> <b>and</b> infrared stereo imagery to generate the dense stereo maps necessary for robust object detection and motivates investigation of <b>color</b> <b>and</b> infrared features {{that can be used}} to further classify detected obstacles into pedestrian regions. The complementary nature of <b>color</b> <b>and</b> infrared features gives rise to a discussion of a feature fusion techniques, including a cross-spectral stereo solution to pedestrian detection.

5|$|In Batesian mimicry, a palatable, {{harmless}} prey species {{mimics the}} appearance of another species that is noxious to predators, thus reducing the mimic's risk of attack. This form of mimicry is seen in many insects. The idea behind Batesian mimicry is that predators that have tried to eat the unpalatable species learn to associate its <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> markings with an unpleasant taste. This results in the predator learning to avoid species displaying similar <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> markings, including Batesian mimics. Some species of octopus can mimic a selection of other animals by changing their skin color, skin pattern and body motion. When a damselfish attacks an octopus, the octopus mimics a banded sea-snake. The model chosen varies with the octopus's predator and habitat. Most of these octopuses use Batesian mimicry, selecting an organism repulsive to predators as a model.|$|E

40|$|Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) {{systems are}} used in order to {{automatically}} index, search, retrieve, and browse image databases. <b>Color</b> <b>and</b> texture features are important properties in content-based image retrieval systems.

Our initial results show that the <b>color</b> moment <b>and</b> <b>color</b> histogram descriptors are not effective features because they do not consider spatial information of image pixels. Therefore, different images may have similar color distributions. In addition, our results show that the CCV and co-occurrence matrix features retrieve much more relevant images than other <b>color</b> <b>and</b> texture features. Additionally, in order to increase precision, the combination of <b>color</b> <b>and</b> texture features should be used in CBIR systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} individuate objects {{is one of}} our most {{fundamental}} cognitive capacities. Recent research has revealed that, when objects vary in color or luminance alone, infants fail to individuate until 11. 5 months. However, <b>color</b> <b>and</b> luminance frequently co-vary in the natural environment, <b>and</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> luminance interact in pattern detection, motion detection, and stereopsis. For this reason, we propose that infants {{may be more likely to}} individuate when objects vary in both <b>color</b> <b>and</b> luminance. Using the narrow-screen task of Wilcox and Baillargeon, Experiments 1 and 2 assessed 7. 5 -month-old infants? ability to individuate uniformly colored objects that either varied in both <b>color</b> <b>and</b> luminance or varied in luminance alone. The results indicated that infants used these features to individuate only when the objects varied in both <b>color</b> <b>and</b> luminance. Thus, when <b>color</b> <b>and</b> luminance co-varied, infants used these features to individuate objects a full 4 months earlier than infants use either feature alone. Experiment 3 further explored the link between <b>color</b> <b>and</b> luminance by assessing 7. 5 -month-old infants? ability to use pattern differences to individuate objects. Although infants use pattern differences created from a combination of luminance <b>and</b> <b>color</b> contrast by 7. 5 months, results from Experiment 3 indicated that when pattern was created from either color contrast or luminance contrast alone, infants fail to individuate based on pattern. The results of Experiment 3 suggest that it is not the number of feature dimensions that is important, but the unique contribution of both <b>color</b> <b>and</b> luminance that is particularly salient to infants. These studies add to a growing body of literature investigating the interaction of <b>color</b> <b>and</b> luminance in object processing in infants, and have implications for developmental changes in the nature and content of infants? object representations...|$|R
