Improper consolidation of concrete can cause product defects, compromise the concrete strength, and produce surface blemishes such as bug holes and honeycombing. An internal <b>concrete</b> <b>vibrator</b> is a steel cylinder {{about the size of the}} handle of a baseball bat, with a hose or electrical cord attached to one end. The vibrator head is immersed in the wet concrete.|$|E

The <b>concrete</b> <b>vibrator</b> was used during concrete casting in order to place the concrete homogeneously in the mold. Concrete test specimens which were removed from the mold and which took hardening of minimum 28  days were drilled from the marked points in order to fit anchorage bolts. The diameter of anchorage holes is 10  mm.|$|E

30|$|All {{steel fiber}} {{concrete}} mixes were mixed in a 4.6  m 3 (6 yd 3) drum mixer at the Texas Concrete Company’s (Victoria, Texas) precast plant. 1.5  m 3 (2 yd 3) of concrete was mixed for each beam. The six PSFC I-Beams were cast in two groups {{on two different}} days. Beams R 2, R 3 and R 6 were first cast concurrently in a long-line prestressing bed using Type-A steel formwork. The strands were prestressed by hydraulic jacks against the prestressing bed ends. The second group of three Beams R 1, R 4 and R 5 were cast 1  week after the first group. Concrete for both the groups was prepared in the plant’s mixer, transported to the casting location (prestressing bed), and placed into the formwork using a mobile hopper. During <b>concrete</b> placement, spud <b>vibrators</b> were used for compacting the fibrous concrete.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is presented}} as a compilation of five papers. Each paper {{is presented as}} a chapter in the dissertation and includes a short literature review, research data, significant findings, and references. A general conclusion section follows {{the main body of the}} dissertation and summarizes the significant findings and includes recommendations for further research.;The first paper presents a paste and concrete laboratory study investigating the two-stage mixing process and its effects on portland cement concrete mix consistency and concrete performance. In the paste study, mixing energy was varied to determine the effects on rheological and compressive strength properties. The concrete study investigated the two-stage mixing process and its effects on fresh and hardened concrete properties.;The second paper details a new characterization procedure for portland cement using the heat signature. A Type I/II portland cement was used to determine the effects of initial water and initial cement temperature on the heat signature of the paste. Several other portland cements, including blended cements, were also investigated to show the differences in cement chemistry when comparing the heat generation curves.;The third paper investigates the effects of differing air entraining agent, water reducing agents, and supplementary cementitious materials on the air void structure of fresh mortar samples. The air void analyzer was used to document the air void structure and identify anomalies or incompatible material combinations. Cubes were cast for compressive strength testing at seven days to show incompatible combinations in terms of retarded strength gain.;The fourth paper uses AVA data from a sixteen state pooled fund study to evaluate the AVA sampling locations. Samples were obtained from the slip formed <b>concrete</b> surface on <b>vibrators</b> and between vibrators from sixteen states. AVA samples were obtained before the paver on three states. Statistical analysis (t-test) was conducted at an alpha level of 0. 05 to determine significance.;The fifth paper presents data on the heat signature of ternary mixes. The heat signatures were characterized and the results were modeled using slope 1 and slope 2, maximum temperature, time to maximum temperature, area under the heat signature curve, initial set, and final set...|$|R
