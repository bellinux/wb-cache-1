50|$|Multi-lobe <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> types (e.g. Rexroth, Hägglunds Drives, Poclain, Rotary Power or Eaton Hydre-MAC type) have a <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> with {{multiple}} lobes and the piston rollers push outward against the <b>cam</b> <b>ring.</b> This produces a very smooth output with high starting torque {{but they are}} often limited in the upper speed range. This type of motor is available in a very wide range from about 1 litre/rev to 250 litres/rev. These motors are particularly good on low speed applications and can develop very high power.|$|E

50|$|A second {{version of}} the engine {{retained}} the cam drive from the pistons, but now had the cylinder block fixed in place with the <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> rotating in the function of a crankshaft. This is illustrated in the NACA report, but not described in the text. The original roller followers for each piston were later replaced by plain bearings.|$|E
40|$|A pitch-change {{apparatus}} for a ducted thrust fan {{having a}} plurality of variable pitch blades employs a <b>camming</b> <b>ring</b> mounted coaxially at the hub at an axially fixed station along the hub axis for rotation about the hub axis both with the blades and relative to the blades. The ring has a generally spherical outer periphery and {{a plurality of}} helical camming grooves extending in a generally spherical plane on the periphery. Each of the variable pitch blades is connected to a pitch-change horn having a cam follower mounted on its outer end, and the <b>camming</b> <b>ring</b> and the horns are so arranged about the hub axis that the plurality of followers on the horns engage respectively the plurality of helical camming grooves. Rotary drive means rotates the <b>camming</b> <b>ring</b> relative to the blades to cause blade pitch to be changed through the cooperative operation of the camming grooves on the <b>ring</b> and the <b>cam</b> followers on the pitch-change horns...|$|R
50|$|The {{screw and nut}} {{may have}} very fine {{identical}} single- or two-start threads. Recirculating rollers are grooved (instead of threaded) so they move axially during spinning engagement with the threads of the nut and screw, shifting up or down by one lead of thread after completing an orbit around the screw. The nut assembly typically includes a slotted cage and <b>cam</b> <b>rings.</b> The cage captivates the rollers in elongated slots, equally spacing the rollers while permitting rotation and axial motion of the rollers. The <b>cam</b> <b>rings</b> have opposing <b>cams</b> aligned with an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. After a roller completes an orbit about the nut it is released into the groove, disengages from nut and screw, and is pushed between the cams to the axial midpoint of the nut assembly (shifting by a distance equal to the lead of the screw). Returned to its starting position, and reengaged to nut and screw, the roller may then orbit the screw once again.|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} a switch pile-up under each movable rotor that was {{operated}} by cams on its plastic outer ring. Different outer rings had different arrangements of cams. The circuitry of the switches controlled solenoids which in turn enabled {{the movement of the}} rotors. The combination of <b>cam</b> <b>rings</b> and the controlling of a rotor by several switches created a most complex and irregular stepping. The exact wiring between switches and solenoids is still classified.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{its small}} size, {{the system can}} deliver 8 000-10 000 newton metres of torque, so a {{separate}} planetary gear set is generally not required. Due to the large number (40) of piston movements per rotation, the torque is also smooth. If the pistons are all withdrawn into the hub, the rollers are not {{in contact with the}} <b>cam</b> <b>ring,</b> and the wheel can freewheel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first version}} of this engine, as {{described}} in the initial patent, was a rotary engine: the 'crank' (in this case the <b>cam</b> <b>ring)</b> remained fixed and the cylinders revolved around it. [...] This type of engine (although as spark-ignition petrol engines, not diesels) had developed before World War I as an aircraft engine, its advantage being improved cooling for the cylinders as they rotated through a stream of cooling air. A disadvantage of the rotary engine was the increased rotating mass, although in the Michel case, the cam track was itself of considerable mass and so the significance was less than it had been for the aircraft engine.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{problems}} with the historical design. The vane tips radially contact the <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> elliptic surface and cause a significant friction as the rotor and vanes turn. This friction is both pressure dependent and speed squared dependent due to RPM-squared centripetal forces. The speed is limited to about 6-7,000 RPM and the pressure is limited to about 2,500 PSI. Another pressure-related {{problem is that the}} pressure forces into the axial rotor to stationary kidney endplate clearance and buckles the device ends thus increasing fluid blowby referred to as 'volumetric efficiency'. Typically, vane pumps and motors have two external ports but there are actually two separate sets of chambers which form two separate pumps and motors. The internal plumbing is y-connected to create only two external ports.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Charles C. Cornelius and Shawn P. Lawlor {{received}} a patent for a cage-less recirculating roller screw system. [...] As {{with the traditional}} recirculating roller screw system, rollers disengage from the screw when they come upon an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. The system differs in that the rollers are continually engaged by the nut, and the axial groove of the nut is threaded. Non-helical threads in the axial groove of the nut return the roller to its axial starting position (after completion of an orbit). Non-circular compression <b>rings,</b> or <b>cam</b> <b>rings,</b> at opposite ends of the rollers (roller axles) apply constant pressure between rollers and nut, synchronizing roller rotation and thrusting the rollers into the nut's axial groove. Lacking ring gears and roller cage, cage-less recirculating roller screws can be relatively efficient and, as a result, permit higher dynamic capacities for some screw shaft diameters.|$|R

50|$|For the Hydristor. a 'concentric nesting {{of endless}} metal belts' replaces the fixed {{elliptic}} <b>cam</b> <b>ring.</b> And, all the vane tipscontact the inner {{surface of the}} belt. The historical friction of the vane tips now causes the belt set to rotate at approximately thesame speed as the rotor and vanes, {{but there is a}} very slight 'walking behind' of the vane contact area and there is a very slight speed slippage which results in the inner belt wear being spread out and this results in much longer belt life. Also, the belt set now confines the pressure and speed-squared forces like a pressure vessel and the potential speed of operation is very much higher. The result of all this is to raise both the operating pressure and the operating speed and this amounts to a 10 times increase in hydraulic packaging density and similar decrease in weight per unit power.|$|E
50|$|The Shvetsov M-11 was {{designed}} under a 1923 {{competition in the}} Soviet Union for a new engine to power trainer aircraft. It is a single-row five-cylinder air-cooled radial piston engine with aluminum cylinder heads. Like the American Kinner B-5 5-cylinder radial of similar size, the M-11 had individual camshafts for each cylinder, operating the pushrods, rather than a single central <b>cam</b> <b>ring.</b> The initial versions of the M-11 suffered from a short service life of only 50 hours. The basic M-11 engine had a power output of 100 hp (73 kW), the newer M-11D variant was higher at 125 hp (92 kW). The ultimate version, M-11FR, introduced in 1946, increased power output to 160 hp at 1,900 rpm on takeoff and 140 hp at cruise and had provisions for a variable-pitch propeller, accessory drive (for vacuum pumps, compressors, generators, etc.) and featured a floatless carburetor.|$|E
50|$|The {{elliptic}} chamber {{is called}} a 'cam ring' by the industry. As a vane moves into, say, a maximum extension, and then rotates into a minimum extension region of the <b>cam</b> <b>ring,</b> it passes through a gradual transition from maximum to minimum followed by a gradual transitionback to maximum and this happens twice per revolution. In order to prevent oil under pressure from bypassing the vanes, 4 sealing areasare created by means of 4 kidney shaped ports located in the transition areas between minimum and maximum. The spaces between the kidney ports are called the sealing areas and this port system is located at either, or both axial ends of the rotor and vanes. The configuration of the ports and sealing areas are such that the space between any two adjacent vanes is slightly less than the coverage ofthe sealing area. In other words, as the vanes rotate through the sealing area, for {{a small amount of}} rotation, both adjacent vanes arewithin the sealing area. As the rotation continues, the first vane in line leaves the sealing area, but not before the next vane in succession is firmly in the sealing region.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{official}} disapproval, the navaja de muelles {{became popular}} throughout Spain as a fighting and general utility knife, {{and was the}} primary personal arm of the Spanish guerrilleros who opposed Napoleon during his invasion and subsequent occupation of Spain in the Peninsular War of 1808-1814. Around 1850, a metal pull ring was incorporated into the lock to facilitate blade closure.

50|$|The fixed {{relationships}} of the elliptic <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> {{are replaced by}} 4 curved surface (cupped) movable pistons located at the 4 sealing areas, at 12,3,6, and 9 o'clock like {{the face of a}} clock. The curvature of each piston rides on a 'hydrodynamic oil bearing' similar to hydroplaning tires in the wet and this virtually eliminates metal-to-metal contact and friction. The first Hydristor achieved almost 95% efficiency overall and the present designs are in the 97+% range. If the 4 pistons are positioned equidistant from the center of rotation, no oil is expressed or accepted by any of the kidney ports. This is called 'neutral'. For a clockwise rotation, if 3 and 9 pistons are moved inward with 6 and 12 moving outward, all moving an equal amount, then a device displacement in proportion to the piston movement is created. If the 6 and 12 pistons were moved in with 3 and 9 moving equally out, then all the oil flows reverse. Since the piston positions are infinitely variable, any possible displacement between zero and + or - maximum displacement can be created. If two such Hydristor units are packaged face-to-face with the 4 port kidney plate between them, an infinitely variable transmission is formed. This transmission can select any ratio in the forward direction and in the reverse direction without the need for any gears.|$|E
40|$|Bosch Rexroth in Mellansel {{develops}} and fabricates Hägglunds {{hydraulic motors}} among other things. One {{important component of}} the motor is the <b>cam</b> <b>ring,</b> which commonly affects the life span of the motor. The aim is to create the basis of a testing equipment where a loose <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> can be tested. Previously, a complete motor has been used in order to test the fatigue resistance of the <b>cam</b> <b>ring.</b> In order to load the <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> similar to the real case. FEM-analysis was performed to investigate how the <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> is affected during loading and how the rig should be built for the strains to be similar to the real case. The result of this simulation was compiled in a Haighdiagram in order to get an indication of the magnitude of the stresses. The solution is a testing equipment which consist of a cylinder block which usually is in the motor. The cylinder block is bolted onto a bottom plate where the <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> has a given position. The <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> is fixated using a sloted spring pin and a dowel pin that keeps the <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> in position and prevents potential torque. All pistons should be pressurised by pulsation at the same time using the same pressure, thus, the torque is expected to be zero. One of the holes which is holding the <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> is oval, this is to allow deformation of the <b>cam</b> <b>ring.</b> The result of this work is a basic plan for the components included which affects the mechanical function of the testing equipment. A limitation of this work has been that the residual stresses in the clearance holes is unknown. These residual stresses have a great importance for fatigue resistance of the cam rings. As a consequence of this, it has been difficult to estimate which working pressure the test rig has to use in order to achieve the desired life span. Experimental testing when using the rig will indicate this. Task monotoring  The testing equipment will generate 1 - 10 million loading cycles before failure of the <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> occurs.

At times it seems after numerous observation, that the rate of progress in the knowledge of wear is very slow. Modern design activities are mostly concern in the wear cumulative values determination rather than the wear values determination in successive time units of friction nods during the operation time. Therefore, presented paper determines in analytical way the cumulative wear values of friction nods after specified finite and infinite units of operation time. Therefore are considered the convergences and divergences of wear value cumulative processes for various friction nods. The kind of friction nods depends on type of wear process propagation. Such propagation is described in this paper by the recurrence first order equation. Mentioned equation is formulated with constant or variable parameters. This parameters are determined by virtue of experimental measurements and depend on: bearing materials properties, environmental conditions, roughness of cooperating surfaces, vibration effects, electrical conductivity of materials, hardness of materials, deformations mode of cooperating surfaces, temperature, air humidity, kind of the friction, sliding velocity, loading of the friction nod and others.

40|$|Industrial {{components}} such as <b>cam</b> shafts and <b>ring</b> gears {{often need}} to have a hard outer surface for wear resistance and a good internal toughness to resist deformation due to impact and loading. These two properties, however, are often mutually exclusive. Case hardening is one solution whereby carbon diffusion into steel results in hardened surface and near-surface layers. Wear resistance is improved while maintaining the bulk toughness of the component. As with many production processes, it is necessary to monitor the quality of the components being manufactured, with case hardening, it is the depth of treatment that is normally measured. Conventional case-depth measurements are destructive, time-consuming, and expensive. Although eddy-current techniques have been applied to the problem [1], the process is often cumbersome due to the need to use more than one frequency.

40|$|Epicyclic {{mechanisms}} {{have found}} wide applications in industry, especially in automobiles and robotics. Low efficiency {{due to the}} high gearing power occurring in an epicyclic train is an important problem. This thesis develops a novel family of epicyclic transmissions, based on cams and rollers. This kind of cam-based mechanical transmissions, Speed-o-Cam (SoC), offers features such as high stiffness, low backlash, and high efficiency. We develop multi-lobbed cam profiles, the sun <b>cam</b> and the <b>ring</b> <b>cam,</b> which comprise an epicyclic cam train (ECT) with the roller follower. New design criteria are established: the generalized transmission index (GTI) and the contact ratio in cam transmissions. The GTI is an index that quantifies the force transmission quality in a mechanism, thereby generalizing the pressure angle, the transmission angle, and the transmission index (TI) proposed by Sutherland and Roth in 1973. The contact ratio is an index of the quantity of overlap occurring between two conjugate cams during transmission. A contact ratio greater than unity guarantees smooth motion during operation. In order to avoid "poor" transmission, we apply an undercutting technique on the cam profile to achieve a smooth motion. We introduce two new concepts, virtual power and virtual power ratio, and derive an original algorithm to compute the efficiency in an epicyclic train upon the assumption that power loss is due only to friction upon meshing. The results show that friction has a larger effect on the total efficiency of an epicyclic train than on a simple train. Examples are given to validate this algorithm, by comparison of our results with previous works. The dual-wheel transmission (DWT), proposed elsewhere using epicyclic gear trains (EGTs), is designed here with epicyclic trains of cams and rollers. We optimize the DWT to achieve a compact design and a high transmission performance. Furthermore, we define the total transmission index (TTI), which allow us to evaluate the final DWT design. Two virtual prototypes of the DWT, the central and the offset versions, are generated: the former is capable of quasi-omnidirectional mobility, the latter of full omnidirectional mobility. Finally, we include a general kinematic analysis of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) with single-wheel drives and apply this method to WMRs with DWT units; then, we obtain symbolic solutions to the direct kinematics (DK) and inverse kinematics (IK) problems, for both central and offset types of units...|$|R

There are several metabolites known to mediate this transition; however, the effect of sarcosine that accumulates in invasive prostate cancer is not known.

Materials and Methods: The effect of sarcosine was studied using different model systems including chick chorioallantoic membrane (<b>CAM),</b> rat aortic <b>rings</b> in culture, and human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) in culture. The statistical significance of difference was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student′s t-test using GraphPad 5 software. Results: Increased vascularization in CAM, increased endothelial sprouting in rat aortic rings in culture, and increased expression of CD 31 and E-selectin suggested a possible angiogenic effect of sarcosine.

40|$|Lubricants are {{subjected}} to high pressures in many mechanical devices - notably gears, <b>cams,</b> piston <b>rings</b> and rolling element bearings. The contact pressure between the ball and the race in a ball bearing can {{be as high as}} 5 GPa. At such high pressures, it is necessary to be able to measure the rheological behaviour of the lubricant in order to obtain input data for computer simulations of rolling and sliding contacts. Lubricant manufacturers are often unable to provide information about the rheology of the lubricant at high pressures, temperatures, shear stresses and shear rates. In paper A, a new Couette rheometer was developed to measure the rheological properties of fluids at pressures up to 500 MPa. The shearrate range covers 0. 5 to 20000 1 /s and the instrument can operate up to 1 O 0 °C at maximum pressure. The results from the apparatus show excellent agreement with measurements made with a failing ball viscometer on a Newtonian fluid. Criteria for non-laminar flow and viscous heating have been developed for the apparatus to verify that these effects do not significantly influence the measurements. In grease lubricated machine elements the supply of grease to the contact region is very important for long life and maintenance-free operation. For example, in a bearing application the grease is often applied within the housing but outside the bearing. For good lubrication the grease has to move from the storage space into the bearing in order to separate the moving surfaces. One important part of this grease movement is the transport from near the contact region into the rolling track. This transportation mechanism may depend on different phenomena such as: capillary forces, vibrations, drop formation, oil bleeding etc. The papers B-G in this thesis describe investigations of these various phenomena. Papers B-D deal with the drop formation of oils and greases in the outlet of an elastohydrodynamically lubricated contact and how different surface energies can affect the distribution of lubricant between the surfaces. Paper E describes the elongation of grease filaments formed when two surfaces are separating from each other, as a function of time. Measurements of the lift off (adhesion) force acting between the two solid surfaces as a function of time were also made. In paper F a ball and disc apparatus was used to study the replenishment of grease due to side slip. The inlet distance and the 'butterfly' shaped meniscus that surrounds the contact point was studied {{as a function of the}} side slip motion of the ball. The filament formation equations from paper E were extended to include the geometry of the butterfly and the inlet distance. Finally, in paper G, four deep groove ball bearings were tested in a SKF R 2 F test rig to evaluate how lift-off-speed and breakthrough-speed are affected by ball spin.

Further, these results reveal that the pressure ratio of the valve decreases to the design value with the increasing working pressure. Additionally, the leakage of the valve rises simultaneously with the increasing working pressure and can be reduced significantly by decreasing the clearance between the valve body and the spool.

In the vane pump, the friction torque arising from the friction between a cam contour and vane tips is significant.

Then the torque characteristics of vane pumps having <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> contours with various values of surface roughness were measured and their results compared with the results of an analysis of the coefficient of friction investigated using test rings. As a result, the friction torque caused by the friction between the cam contour and the vane tip was reduced by lessening the surface roughness of the cam contour, resulting in an improvement of the mechanical efficiency. The coefficient of friction measured by using the test rings could be applied to the actual vane pumps...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to create a}} better {{understanding}} of the <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> production and provide information on how to reduce customer order lead time. The method used was discrete event simulation. A model of the <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> production was created in ExtendSim 8 and experiments were performed. Bosch Rexroth Mellansel manufactures durable hydraulic radial piston motors. The motors come in five models that are called CA, CB, CBM, VI and MA. For each motor there are one to six cam rings depending on the model, and there are a total of 30 types of cam rings. The production system consists of four main processes: Milling, hardening, grinding and quality control. The material flow and production control is quite complex which creates frequently occurring problems. One of the main contributors to the complex system is the hardening work cell called EFD, due to a first piece destructive testing and long setup times, large batch sizes are being used. The scope of the simulation was the production of cam rings, from raw material to completed components ready for assembly. The simulation time was 315 days and each experiments was conducted with 3 - 10 simulation runs. The results from the simulation studies are: •Big batch sizes create long lead times and irregular machine load. •The production can successfully be controlled by using a reorder point. •The planned inventory levels in the MRP (Manufacturing Requirements Planning) system Axapta can be better adapted to fit the demand. •Destructive testing motivates large stocks, large batch sizes and creates test costs of approximately (DELETED) million SEK each year. •An investment of nondestructive testing is estimated to give an approximate payback time of 1, 4 years. When implemented, there is a potential to reduce batch sizes by half from current sizes, which would increase flexibility. It would also reduce tied up capital by (DELETED) million SEK. These recommendations were made to Bosch Rexroth Mellansel: •Invest more resources for evaluating the applicability of nondestructive testing and to implement it if possible. •When nondestructive testing is implemented and set-up time in the EFD machine is reduced, reduce batch sizes step by step to find appropriate levels. •Create a standardized production control which has its roots in the master production schedule. •Adapt the planned inventory and the batch sizes in Axapta to fit the appropriate levels.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis work was to {{establish}} a fatigue-test setup and perform several tests to characterize different combinations of steels and heat treatments. These materials should be suited for usage as <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> material in hydraulic drives. Carring out the tests {{in a short time}} {{was one of the main}} features for the selection of the test-method. For characterizing the materials the Standing Contact Fatigue method was choosen. In this method, the sample is pressed against a hard ball in rapid succession causing different types of cracks in the contact-zone. The contact area was inspected after each test. Since a continuation of a performed test is not possible, a following test was carried out with more or less cylces, depending on the previous result (cracks found or no cracks present). In addition, a strain-gauge set-up was established for testing an insitu crack detection. Mostly ring-cone cracks were found at the edge of the indentation but inside the indent. The sectional view shows, that these crack grow underneath the indentation. The tests, performed at 60 Hz and a load cycle between 500 N and 15 kN, show a higher fatigue limit for the samples tempered at 240 °C than the samples at 180 °C. The highest fatigue limit was tested for the electro slag remelted steel tempered at 240 °C. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was the {{investigation}} of the use of the twin disc machine testing as an experimental method to simulate, identify and evaluate rolling contact fatigue in a short time for different combinations (ESR and standard) of <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> steels with different case heat treatments (tempered at 180 ˚C and 240 ˚C). The ring samples were machined to achieve an elliptic contact in order to increase the contact pressure and achieve fast results. The contact pressure was calculated according to the Hertzian formula taking in account the shape parameters of the rings. The tests were performed with higher or lower amount of cycles depending on the previous results (cracks found or not) and for different contact pressures. The contact area was SEM inspected after each test. Friction and wear plots were used as fatigue criteria complementarily to the SEM analysis. The tests conditions (shape, roughness, friction coefficient) were studied and appeared to cause a scatter in the results because of their variation from one sample to another affecting the stress distribution, type of damage and the lubrication regime (film thickness). Therefore, the stress distribution was simulated under the elliptic contact surface taking in account, these parameters (shape parameters, roughness, friction coefficient). The tests showed that the twin disk testing method was useful for pitting detection in RCF under lubrication. Meanwhile, the quality of the samples was of extreme importance in order to keep constant conditions in different runs. The contact area SEM inspection after each test showed that high contact pressures induce adhesive damage in the samples that may accelerate RCF damage. The highest rolling contact fatigue limit was observed for the ESR steels. Validerat; 20110921 (anonymous...|$|E
