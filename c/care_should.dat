Particular <b>care</b> <b>should</b> be taken in pregnant or elderly people, people with substance abuse history (particularly alcohol dependence), and people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The use of alprazolam should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with: myasthenia gravis, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe liver deficiencies (e.g., cirrhosis), severe sleep apnea, pre-existing respiratory depression, marked neuromuscular respiratory, acute pulmonary insufficiency, chronic psychosis, hypersensitivity or allergy to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines, and borderline personality disorder (where it may induce suicidality and dyscontrol).|$|E
5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} {{can also cause}} severe third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency of oil {{to stick to the}} skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands on top of the stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost <b>care</b> <b>should</b> be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E

The flag should never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors and then, burning.|$|E

5|$|Contact {{with skin}} is dangerous, and {{adequate}} ventilation {{should be provided}} when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure by inhalation should not exceed 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium will readily absorb through the skin and <b>care</b> <b>should</b> be taken to avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by inhalation at the PEL. Thallium is a suspected human carcinogen. For a long time thallium compounds were readily available as rat poison. This fact {{and that it is}} water-soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.|$|E
5|$|In {{adults and}} {{children}} {{over the age of}} 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring hemodialysis, <b>care</b> <b>should</b> be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed in people undergoing continuous hemofiltration, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be given more frequently than normal in people with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, the Pacific {{electric}} ray can generate up to 45 volts of electricity {{for the purposes}} of subduing prey or self-defense. It feeds mainly on bony fishes, ambushing them from the substrate during the day and actively hunting for them at night. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the embryos are initially nourished by yolk, later supplemented by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females bear litters of 17–20 pups, probably once every other year. <b>Care</b> <b>should</b> be exercised around the Pacific {{electric ray}}, as it has been known to act aggressively if provoked and its electric shock can potentially incapacitate a diver. It and other electric rays are used as model organisms for biomedical research. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as it is not fished in any significant numbers.|$|E

5|$|An {{elevated}} core temperature, {{leading to}} increased symptom presentation {{has been noted}} during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. <b>Care</b> <b>should</b> be taken not to overheat a person with MS {{during the course of}} exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure. The interaction between an elevated core temperature and the pathological demyelination can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function. These effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies. Behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler, or installing an air conditioner.|$|E
