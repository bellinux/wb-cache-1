40|$|The {{effects of}} the size of the {{particles}} of ATH filler on the life of room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone rubber coating was studied in a salt-fog chamber. The median particle sizes examined were 1. 0, 4. 5, 13, 17 and 75 μm. The optimum size giving the lowest leakage current and the longest time to failure of the coating was determined. The particle size affected the roughness of the coating. The roughness was enhanced after a prolonged test in salt-fog. The leakage current affected the amount of silicone fluid on the surface. The amount of silicone fluid present on the surface after exposure to dry-band arcing in salt-fog was a function of the particle size. Measurements of surface roughness, the amount of silicone fluid on the surface, and the leakage current combined with theoretical analysis of the heat of conduction, lead to identification of the mechanisms by which the size of the ATH particle impart resistance to tracking and erosion. The influences of the coating thickness, different substrates, addition of silicone fluid to the coating system and different <b>carrier</b> <b>solvents</b> on the leakage current, pulse current count rates and the life of the RTV coatings were investigated. It was found that all these parameters affected the electrical performance in salt-fog. The content of low molecular weight (LMW) silicone fluid and the diffusion of LMW from the bulk to the surface were determined. ATH filled RTV coatings having thicknesses from 0. 17 to 0. 99 mm, ATH particle sizes from 1. 0 to 75 μm and different <b>carrier</b> <b>solvents</b> were used. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

However, very little information is available regarding {{the effects of these}} solvents on the expression of pro and anti-apoptotic genes and proteins. Materials and Methods: In this study, we examined the cytotoxic effects of methanol and dimethylsulfoxide at 0. 5 % (final concentrations recommended for in-vitro toxicity assays) on human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells. We also investigated the effects of these solvents on the mRNA and immunocytochemical expression of apoptotic proteins BAX and BCL- 2. Results: The results of neutral red cell viability assay showed that methanol and DMSO concentrations of 0. 5 % exhibited no cytotoxic effects on MCF- 7 cells following a 24 hour exposure. Gene expression and Immunofluorescence results showed that methanol but not DMSO reduced the expression of the BAX pro-apoptotic protein, while both solvents did not alter the expression of the BCL- 2 oncoprotein. Conclusion: Our results suggest that while methanol concentrations at 0. 5 % may be appropriate for in vitro toxicity studies in human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells, it could alter the results of gene and protein expression experiments...|$|R

Shear-thinning flow character resulted over most of the shear-rate range examined, especially for the concentrated suspensions with phi >= 0. 25. The concentrated suspensions were indeed flocculated.

The technology is straightforward, {{does not require}} sophisticated cold traps or adsorbent traps, and allows collecting large numbers of fractions during a GC run. The technology is based on direct infusion of a <b>carrier</b> <b>solvent</b> {{at the end of}} the GC column, where infusion takes place in the GC oven. Pentane and hexane used as <b>carrier</b> <b>solvent</b> showed good results. Acetonitrile also showed good results as a more polar <b>carrier</b> <b>solvent.</b> Development and optimization of the technology is described, followed by demonstration in a high-throughput effect directed analysis setting toward dioxin receptor bioactivity. The GC fractionation setup was capable of collecting fractions in the second range. As a result, fractionated compounds could be collected into one or two fractions when 6. 5 s resolution fractionation was performed. Subsequently, mixtures containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, of which some are bioactive toward the dioxin receptor, were profiled with a mammalian gene reporter assay. After fractionation into 96 -well plates, we used our new approach for direct cell seeding onto the fractions prior to assaying which allowed dioxin receptor bioactivity to be measured directly after fractionation. The current technology represents a great advance in effect directed analysis for environmental screening worldwide as it allows combining the preferred analytical separation technology for often non-polar environmental pollutants with environmentally relevant bioassays, in high resolution. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|E

Some of these factors have been explored in this thesis for eight reactive contaminants exhibiting varied physicochemical properties using the rainbow trout cell lines RTgill-W 1 and RTL-W 1. Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) {{was used as a}} reference (control) chemical. Cell viability was evaluated with alamar Blue, carboxyfluoroscein diacetate acetoxymethyl ester and neutral red as measures respectively of metabolic activity, plasma membrane integrity, and lysosomal function. Experimental in vitro EC 50 values were compared to 1) pre-existing in vivo LC 50 s from the fathead minnow database and 2) pre-existing in vitro EC 50 s from the Halle database. Results point to good in vitro/in vivo correlations for menadione, dichlorophene, hexachlorophene, and acrolein. Poor correlations were observed for allyl alcohol, 4 -fluoroaniline, acetaldehyde, and 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene due to a combination of solubility and volatility problems. Overall, the results suggest that the impact of different technical approaches on the evaluation of acute toxicity in vitro depends very much on the chemical class being investigated and less on the characteristics of the cell line.

40|$|Petroleum {{hydrocarbons}} are {{the most}} widespread contaminants in the environment. Interest in the biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and compounds (PAHs/PACs) is motivated by their ubiquitous distribution, their low bioavailability, high persistence in soils and their potentially deleterious effects to human health. Identifying the diversity of microorganisms that degrade PAHs/PACs can be utilised {{in the development of}} bioremediation techniques. Understanding the mechanisms of bacterial populations to adapt to the presence of pollutants and the extent that lateral transfer of key functional genes occurs, will allow the exploitation of microbial PAC/PAH-degradative capabilities and therefore enhance the successful application of bioremediation strategies. A key aim {{of this study was to}} isolate and identify PAC-degrading bacteria for potential use in future bioremediation programmes. A series of PAC enrichments were established under the same experimental conditions from a single sediment sample taken from a highly polluted estuarine site. Distinct microbial community shifts were directly attributable to enrichment with different PAC substrates. The findings of this study demonstrate that five divisions of the Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria can degrade PACs. By determining the precise identity of the PAC-degrading bacteria isolated, and by comparing these with previously published research, this study showed how bacteria with similar PAC degrading capabilities and 16 S rRNA signatures are found in similarly polluted environments in geographically very distant locations e. g. China, Italy, Japan and Hawaii. Such a finding suggests that geographical barriers do not limit the distribution of key PAC-degrading bacteria. This is significant when considering the diversity and global distribution of microbes with PAC-degradative capabilities and the potential for utilising these microbial populations in future bioremediation strategies. In the laboratory, enrichment of bacteria able to utilise PAHs has commonly been performed in liquid media, with the PAH dissolved in a <b>carrier</b> <b>solvent.</b> This study found the presence of a <b>carrier</b> <b>solvent</b> significantly affects the resultant microbial population. Although the same sediment sample was used as the bacterial source in all enrichments, different bacterial strains were obtained depending upon the presence of the <b>carrier</b> <b>solvent</b> and the PAH. This is important when considering appropriate methodology for the isolation of PAH-degrading bacteria for future bioremediation programmes. Additionally, the species comprising the resultant population of the enrichment when a <b>carrier</b> <b>solvent</b> was present were similar to previously reported PAH-degrading species. Such a finding necessitates review of previously reported PAH-degrading bacterial species that have been isolated and identified from enrichments using a <b>carrier</b> <b>solvent.</b> Understanding how bacteria acclimatise to environmental pollutants is vital for exploiting these mechanisms within clear up strategies of contaminated sites. Two major lineages of the Î± subunit of PAH dioxygenases were identified: Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Comparison of the Î± subunit phylogeny with the 16 S rRNA phylogeny implies that the PAH-dioxygenases evolved prior to the separation of these phyla or that lateral transfer occurred in the very distant past. No evidence for lateral transfer of the Î± subunit between the Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria was found in the phylogenetic analyses of this research. Multiple lateral transfer events were inferred between the species of the Actinobacteria and between the classes of the Proteobacteria. The clustering of the taxa within the Î± subunit phylogeny indicates that lateral transfer of the Î± subunit gene occurred after the separation of the classes of Proteobacteria and also after the speciation of the Î³-Proteobacteria. These findings reveal how bacteria have acclimatised to PAH pollutants through multiple lateral transfer events of a key PAH-degradative gene. This knowledge of the transfer of genetic material will broaden our prospects of exploiting microbial populations...|$|E

The conjugated polymer poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) {{as well as}} P 3 HT:fullerene bulk-heterojunction blends can be spin-coated from a mixture of the crystallizable solvent 1, 3, 5 -trichlorobenzene (TCB) and a second <b>carrier</b> <b>solvent</b> such as chlorobenzene. Solidification is initiated by growth of macroscopic TCB spherulites followed by epitaxial crystallization of P 3 HT on TCB crystals. Subsequent sublimation of TCB leaves behind {{a replica of the}} original TCB spherulites. Thus, highly ordered thin films are obtained, which feature square-centimeter-sized domains that are composed of one spherulite-like structure each. A combination of optical microscopy and polarized photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals radial alignment of the polymer backbone in case of P 3 HT, whereas P 3 HT:fullerene blends display a tangential orientation with respect to the center of spherulite-like structures. Moreover, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering reveals an increased relative degree of crystallinity and predominantly flat-on conformation of P 3 HT crystallites in the blend. The use of other processing methods such as dip-coating is also feasible and offers uniaxial orientation of the macromolecule. Finally, the applicability of this method to a variety of other semi-crystalline conjugated polymer systems is established. Those include other poly(3 -alkylthiophene) s, two polyfluorenes, the low band-gap polymer PCPDTBT, a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) small molecule {{as well as a number}} of polymer:fullerene and polymer:polymer blends.

50|$|Bonding {{agents are}} often methacrylates with some {{volatile}} <b>carrier</b> and <b>solvent</b> like acetone. They may also contain diluent monomers.

Modern dental bonding systems come as a “three-step system”, where the etchant, primer, and adhesive are applied sequentially; as a “two-step system”, where the etchant and the primer are combined for simultaneous application; and as a “one-step system”, where all the components should be premixed and applied in a single application (so-called seventh generation of bonding agents).|$|R
30|$|Bioassays play {{a central}} role in effect-directed {{analysis}} (EDA), and their selection and application have to consider rather specific aspects of this approach. Meanwhile, bioassays with zebrafish, an established model organism in different research areas, are increasingly being utilized in EDA. Aiming to contribute for the optimal application of zebrafish bioassays in EDA, this review provides a critical overview of previous EDA investigations that applied zebrafish bioassays, discusses the potential contribution of such methods for EDA and proposes strategies to improve future studies. Over the last 10  years, zebrafish bioassays have guided EDA of natural products and environmental samples. The great majority of studies performed bioassays with embryos and early larvae, which allowed small-scale and low-volume experimental setups, minimized sample use and reduced workload. Biotesting strategies applied zebrafish bioassays as either the only method guiding EDA or instead integrated into multiple bioassay approaches. Furthermore, tiered biotesting applied zebrafish methods in both screening phase as well as for further investigations. For dosing, most of the studies performed solvent exchange of extracts and fractions to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as carrier. However, high DMSO concentrations were required for the testing of complex matrix extracts, indicating that future studies might benefit from the evaluation of alternative <b>carrier</b> <b>solvents</b> or passive dosing. Surprisingly, only a few studies reported the evaluation of process blanks, indicating a need to improve and standardize methods for blank preparation and biotesting. Regarding evaluated endpoints, while acute toxicity brought limited information, the assessment of specific endpoints was of strong value for bioactivity identification. Therefore, the bioassay specificity and sensitivity to identify the investigated bioactivity are important criteria in EDA. Additionally, it might be necessary to characterize the most adequate exposure windows and assessment setups for bioactivity identification. Finally, a great advantage of zebrafish bioassays in EDA of environmental samples is the availability of mechanism- and endpoint-specific methods for the identification of important classes of contaminants. The evaluation of mechanism-specific endpoints in EDA is considered to be a promising strategy to facilitate the integration of EDA into weight-of-evidence approaches, ultimately contributing for the identification of environmental contaminants causing bioassay and ecological effects.|$|R

Additionally, DMSO is not suitable for chemical analysis, which restricts the characterization of samples evaluated in biotesting. Therefore, the investigation of alternative carrier solvents would be an asset for zebrafish bioassays in EDA. Passive dosing methods are also promising options, as recently done in EDA investigation of sediments {{through the use of}} silicone rods for dosing of extracts and fractions in algae bioassay [66]. In fact, a loaded polymer silicone cast has successfully been integrated in zebrafish embryo assay for dosing of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [67].|$|E
40|$|A flow-injection {{system with}} a biamperometric {{flow-through}} detector provided with two platinum plate electrodes was tested for the determination of water with a two-component pyridine-free Karl Fischer reagent. The response was shown to be linear in the concentration range 0. 03 – 0. 11 % water in methanol, ethanol or 2 -propanol, with methanol as the <b>carrier</b> <b>solvent.</b> The maximum sampling frequency was about 150 samples per hr. It appeared to be possible to introduce a membrane separation step, thus allowing for the determination of water in fouled process streams. To avoid direct contact between the Karl Fischer solution and the pumping tubes, and thus extend the lifetime of the tubes, an indirect delivery system, based on replacement of the solution by pumped silicone oil, was also applied...|$|E
40|$|Preferential {{oriented}} multiwalled carbon nanotubes {{were prepared}} by the injection chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method using either cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer or cycloctatetraene iron tricarbonyl as the iron catalyst source. The catalyst precursors were dissolved in toluene as the <b>carrier</b> <b>solvent</b> for the injections. The concentration of the catalyst was found to influence both {{the growth of the}} nanotubes as well as the amount of iron in the deposited material. As deposited the multiwalled carbon nanotubes contained as little as 2. 8 % iron by weight. The material was deposited onto tantalum foil and fused silica substrates. The nanotubes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. This synthetic route provides a simple and scalable method to deposit MWNTs with a low defect density, low metal content and preferred orientation...|$|E
40|$|The fluorotelomer-based {{compounds}} {{are highly}} fluorinated organics that are uniquely both hydrophobic and oleophobic, thus widely utilized in industrial and consumer products to change surface properties (e. g., rendering textile fabrics stain-resistant). These products are suspected to contain or degrade into fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and subsequently into perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) including perfluorooctanoate, {{which has been}} globally detected in wildlife, humans and the environment. The high fluorination imparts unique physico-chemical properties that are not well-characterized, and subsequently, their behavior in the environment is not well understood. To shed light on potential sources of perfluorochemical contamination observed globally, this dissertation focused on evaluating the solubility, sorption and biotransformation of four dominant FTOH homologues (4 : 2 to 10 : 2 FTOH) and biotransformation of two FTOH-derived surfactants with mono-ester and tri-ester linkages. ^ The solubility and sorption of 4 : 2 and 6 : 2 FTOHs were measured adequately in aqueous systems, while the higher homologues required the validation and use of a log-linear cosolvency model. The aqueous solubility of FTOHs and the non-fluorine homologues (n-alkanols) followed a single log-linear correlation with modified McGowan molar volumes. However, 8 : 2 and 10 : 2 FTOHs (solids at 25 °C) exhibited smaller entropy of melt values than expected for long chain molecules. Sorption increased with increasing soil organic carbon (OC) and perfluorocarbon chain length. The aerobic microbial degradation of 8 : 2 FTOH was assessed by monitoring metabolites over time using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and included assessing the effect of <b>carrier</b> <b>solvents</b> (ethanol, octanol and 1, 4 -dioxane). With octanol (the structural analogue of 8 : 2 FTOH), transformation was temporarily inhibited until depletion of octanol. Similar results were observed with soil bacteria enriched from soil using sole octanol carbon source. In all cases biodegradation pathways appeared the same. Cleavage of the fluorotelomer stearate mono-ester linkage with release of FTOHs occurred in soils with the subsequent generation of the fluorinated acids typical of 8 : 2 FTOH biotransformation, whereas the fluorotelomer citrate tri-esters appeared more stable. Novel solvent and soil-dependent abiotic hydrolysis was also observed. ^ This study has contributed to {{a deeper understanding of}} organo-fluorine chemistry and confirmed that estimations of global PFCA emissions should include breakdown of at least low molecular weight FTOH-derived compounds. ...|$|R
40|$|Capillary {{chromatography}} {{using an}} untreated open tubular capillary tube and a ternary solvent mixture consisting of water-hydrophilic/hydrophobic organic <b>solvent</b> as a <b>carrier</b> solution has been developed. The system is called tube radical distribution chromatography (TRDC). Separation {{performance of the}} TRDC system using a fused-silica capillary tube was examined through the phase diagram for the ternary water-acetonitrile-ethyl acetate solvent mixture. The TRDC system required homogeneous <b>carrier</b> solutions with <b>solvent</b> component ratios around the boundary curve between homogeneous and heterogeneous solution in the phase diagram. The data obtained using the fused-silica capillary tube were compared with those obtained using a polytetrafluoroethylene capillary tube in our previous study...|$|R
40|$|Stable {{syndiotactic}} polystyrene (s-PS) co-crystals {{with highly}} polar guests {{have been prepared}} by sorption in delta or in co-crystalline phases of molecules dissolved in suitable <b>solvent</b> <b>carriers.</b> These co-crystals are clathrates, that is, isolated molecules are imprisoned as a guest into cavities formed between layers of polymer helices, and the maximum guest molecular volume is close to 0. 25 nm 3. Infrared linear dichroism measurements show that molecules included in s-PS molecular complexes are oriented nearly perpendicular to the chain axes of the polymeric crystalline phase. These new materials present in their crystalline phases an ordered three-dimensional arrangement of highly polar molecules with large first-order hyperpolarizability...|$|R
