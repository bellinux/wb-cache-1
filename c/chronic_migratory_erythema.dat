40|$|Summary Introduction: glucagonoma is a {{pancreatic}} neuroendocrine tumor {{derived from}} alpha-cells of the islets of Langerhans. It {{is marked by}} tumoral autonomous production of glucagon and characterized, among other symptoms, by necrolytic <b>migratory</b> <b>erythema,</b> an erythematous circinate lesion with areas of necrosis and sloughing. This is a rare disease with worldwide incidence estimated at 1 case per 20 million people. Case report: we report a case of glucagonoma associated necrolytic <b>migratory</b> <b>erythema</b> in a male patient, 56 years, with signs of skin lesions mainly on his legs and groin, hyperglycemia and weight loss. Biopsies of the skin lesions were performed and imaging of the abdomen showed a mass of 10 x 9 cm, at the pancreatic region. The patient was subjected to body-caudal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with autotransplant of the spleen in the greater omentum. The histopathologic report indicated a tumor in the pancreatic alpha cells. Immunohistochemistry showed expression of glucagon and chromogranin A in most tumor cells, consistent with the diagnosis of glucagonoma. The patient presented 3 years of outpatient follow-up with no complications.

40|$|The glucagonoma {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} disease in which a typical skin disorder, necrolytic <b>migratory</b> <b>erythema,</b> is often {{one of the first}} presenting symptoms. Weight loss and diabetes mellitus are two other prevalent characteristics of this syndrome. Necrolytic <b>migratory</b> <b>erythema</b> belongs to the recently recognized family of deficiency dermatoses of which zinc deficiency, necrolytic acral erythema and pellagra are also members. It is typically characterized on skin biopsies by necrolysis of the upper epidermis with vacuolated keratinocytes. In persistent hyperglucagonemia, excessive stimulation of basic metabolic pathways results in diabetes mellitus at the expense of tissue glycogen stores, and muscle and fat mass. Multiple (essential) nutrient and vitamin B deficiencies develop, which contribute to the dermatosis. In addition, glucagonomas may produce various other products, like pancreatic polypeptide, that add to the catabolic effects of glucagon. © 2004 Society of the European Journal of Endocrinology...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} 61 -year-old {{man with a}} 2 -year history of {{persistent}} disseminated, psoriasiform annular pruritic lesions, acrodermatitis, weight loss, anemia and diabetes. Histopathology of the affected skin showed nonspecific subacute psoriasiform dermatitis. The computed tomographic scan of the abdomen revealed multiple hepatic tumors. Histopathological examination of ultrasound-guided needle biopsy from a hepatic lesion demonstrated a neuroendocrine tumor. Somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy with radio-labelled octreotide confirmed {{the likelihood of the}} neuroendocrine nature of the hepatic tumors and excluded the presence of other such lesions {{throughout the rest of the}} body, including the pancreas. The serum glucagon level was markedly increased. The diagnosis of necrolytic <b>migratory</b> <b>erythema</b> associated with hyperglucagonemia and neuroendocrine hepatic tumors was made and therapy with the long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide was started. The skin changes resolved after the initiation of therapy, but no improvement of other symptoms was observed. Having reached the final stage of the disease, which was further complicated by congestive heart failure, the patient died one year later. As no autopsy was performed, we were unable to establish whether the hepatic tumors represented a metastatic process of previously undetected pancreatic glucagonoma or if they were extra-pancreatic glucagon-secreting tumors. The correct diagnosis of necrolytic <b>migratory</b> <b>erythema</b> is important, since it might be the clue for early detection of glucagonoma or of extra-pancreatic glucagon-secreting tumors...|$|R
