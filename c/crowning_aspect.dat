He said that his life was boring and stupid without her. Something or other--she did not catch what--he was damned if he could stand.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Lodgepole pine (Pinus conorta) is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} forest type across western North America. Central Oregon lodgepole pine forests are ecologically unique {{when compared to other}} lodgepole pine ecosystems. Sierra lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta ssp. murrayana) is the dominant variety and often exists as the climax species on pumice soils, while in most other regions lodgepole pine is an early successional species. Most lodgepole pine research has been conducted at high elevations in the Rocky Mountains. Research findings from other geographic locations may not by applicable to central Oregon lodgepole pine ecosystem. Forest and tree biomass distribution and utilization is currently of interest in the northwestern United States due to large outbreaks of MPB, changes in fuel distribution, and the desire utilize lodgepole pine for wood products and biomass. Understanding natural stand dynamics and responses to disturbance on individual tree physiology and canopy biomass distribution requires detailed studies on the structural differences of central Oregon lodgepole pine ecosystems. Little is currently known about the influence of vertical position and <b>crown</b> <b>aspect</b> within the canopy and their effect on the distribution of canopy biomass, herbivory and foliage retention in central Oregon lodgepole pine. This thesis describes the influence of both vertical crown position and <b>crown</b> <b>aspect</b> on the distribution of live biomass, herbivory and foliage retention in central Oregon lodgepole pine crowns. We randomly selected and sampled 33 trees within a stand in the Deschutes National Forest in central Oregon. We systematically sampled 36 branches from each tree, from which we measured total biomass, the percentage of consumed leaf area (visually estimated) and the foliage retention in years of each branch. Linear mixed models (LMMs) were used for this study to describe the responses of crown structure attributes to live biomass distribution, herbivory distribution and foliar retention distribution. A nested experimental design was used, where plots were nested within the stand to account for the differing levels of between plot variability. We found strong evidence that the vertical position of the branch within the tree crown has a significant effect on the distribution of total biomass per branch, percentage of consumed leaf area and needle longevity. We also found that <b>crown</b> <b>aspect</b> has a significant influence on the distribution of branch biomass, but does not {{have a significant effect on}} herbivory or foliage retention. The biomass findings were consistent with findings in previous Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine studies; however there were inherent differences present with needle longevity and the distribution of the foliage retention. There are differences between lodgepole pine ecosystems in the intermountain west and central Oregon, which need to be accounted for when further studying crown architecture and canopy structure...|$|R

Model adjustment was performed after dynamic injection of a background contribution predicted via the kernel weights of a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model. Accuracy was assessed with respect to similar maps obtained with data from the NASA Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and to contemporaneous US Forest Service (USFS) maps based partly on Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. MODIS and MISR retrievals of forest fractional cover and mean height both showed compatibility with the USFS maps, with MODIS mean absolute errors (MAE) of 0. 09 and 8. 4 m respectively, compared with MISR MAE of 0. 10 and 2. 2 m, respectively. The respective MAE for aboveground woody biomass was ~ 10 Mg ha− 1, {{the same as that}} from MISR, although the MODIS retrievals showed a much weaker correlation, noting that these statistics do not represent evaluation with respect to ground survey data. Good height retrieval accuracies with respect to averages from high resolution discrete return lidar data and matches between mean <b>crown</b> <b>aspect</b> ratio and mean crown radius maps and known vegetation type distributions both support the contention that the GO model results are not spurious when adjusted against MISR bidirectional reflectance factor data. These results highlight an alternative to empirical methods for the exploitation of moderate resolution remote sensing data in the mapping of woody plant canopies and assessment of woody biomass loss and recovery from disturbance in the southwestern United States and in parts of the world where similar environmental conditions prevail...|$|R

5|$|Indraloris molars {{are short}} and {{organized}} in two main lophs (lobes). They differ from Sivaladapis teeth in being shorter and broader, with a shorter talonid {{and a smaller}} hypoconulid. In Indraloris himalayensis lower molars, there are four main cusps (protoconid and metaconid in the trigonid, hypoconid and entoconid in the talonid), which give the <b>crown</b> a rectangular <b>aspect,</b> although the labial cusps (protoconid and hypoconid) are placed somewhat anterior to their lingual counterparts. In I.kamlialensis, the entoconid is distinct from the hypoconulid, which is large, but the tooth is otherwise similar. The cusps are high relative to those of extant lorises and approximately equal in height. The cristid obliqua, a crest, descends from the hypoconid to a point on the lingual side of the protoconid. On the hypoconid, this crest forms a right angle with the posterolophid, which runs towards the hypoconulid in the back lingual corner of the tooth. Between the metaconid and entoconid, the talonid basin is open. In I.himalayensis at least (the structure is damaged in the only known lower molar of I.kamlialensis) there is a well-developed hollow in the trigonid {{in front of the}} protoconid and metaconid. There is a labial cingulum between the protoconid and hypoconid. YGSP 32152 is so worn that little of its structure remains visible. It shows a short trigonid and a distinct entoconid. A small hypoconulid, close to the entoconid, is suggested by an enamel swelling. This specimen is fragmentary enough that it could also represent a catarrhine primate or a carnivoran.|$|R
40|$|This work of thesis {{involves}} {{various aspects}} of crystal engineering. Chapter 1 focuses on crystals containing <b>crown</b> ether complexes. <b>Aspects</b> such as the possibility of preparing these materials by non-solution methods, i. e. by direct reaction of the solid components, thermal behavior and also isomorphism and interconversion between hydrates are taken into account. In chapter 2 a study is presented aimed to understanding the relationship between hydrogen bonding capability {{and shape of the}} building blocks chosen to construct crystals. The focus is on the control exerted by shape on the organization of sandwich cations such as cobalticinium, decamethylcobalticinium and bisbenzenchromium(I) and on the aggregation of monoanions all containing carboxylic and carboxylate groups, into 0 -D, 1 -D, 2 -D and 3 -D networks. Reactions conducted in multi-component molecular assemblies or co-crystals have been recognized as a way to control reactivity in the solid state. The [2 + 2] photodimerization of olefins is a successful demonstration of how templated solid state synthesis can efficiently synthesize unique materials with remarkable stereoselectivity and under environment-friendly conditions. A demonstration of this synthetic strategy is given in chapter 3. The combination of various types of intermolecular linkages, leading to formation of high order aggregation and crystalline materials or to a random aggregation resulting in an amorphous precipitate, may not go to completeness. In such rare cases an aggregation process intermediate between crystalline and amorphous materials is observed, resulting in the formation of a gel, i. e. a viscoelastic solid-like or liquid-like material. In chapter 4 design of new Low Molecular Weight Gelators is presented. Aspects such as the relationships between molecular structure, crystal packing and gelation properties and the application of this kind of gels as a medium for crystal growth of organic molecules, such as APIs, are also discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Based on our {{knowledge}} of locomotor biomechanics and ecology we predict the locomotion and posture of the last common ancestors of (a) great and lesser apes and their close fossil relatives (hominoids); (b) chimpanzees, bonobos and modern humans (hominines); and (c) modern humans and their fossil relatives (hominins). We evaluate our propositions against the fossil record {{in the context of}} a broader review of evolution of the locomotor system from the earliest hominoids of modern <b>aspect</b> (<b>crown</b> hominoids) to early modern Homo sapiens. While some early East African stem hominoids were pronograde, it appears that the adaptations which best characterize the crown hominoids are orthogrady and an ability to abduct the arm above the shoulder – rather than, as is often thought, manual suspension sensu stricto. At 7 – 9 Ma (not much earlier than the likely 4 – 8 Ma divergence date for panins and hominins, see Bradley, 2008) there were crown hominoids in southern Europe which were adapted to moving in an orthograde posture, supported primarily on the hindlimb, in an arboreal, and possibly for Oreopithecus, a terrestrial context. By 7 Ma, Sahelanthropus provides evidence of a Central African hominin, panin or possibly gorilline adapted to orthogrady, and both orthogrady and habitually highly extended postures of the hip are evident in the arboreal East African protohominin Orrorin at 6 Ma. If the traditional idea that hominins passed through a terrestrial ‘knuckle-walking’ phase is correct, not only does it have to be explained how a quadrupedal gait typified by flexed postures of the hindlimb could have preadapted the body for the hominin acquisition of straight-legged erect bipedality, but we would have to accept a transition from stem-hominoid pronogrady to crown hominoid orthogrady, back again to pronogrady in the African apes and then back to orthogrady in hominins. Hand-assisted arboreal bipedality, which is part of a continuum of orthograde behaviours, is used by modern orangutans to forage among the small branches at the periphery of trees where the core hominoid dietary resource, ripe fruit, is most often to be found. Derivation of habitual terrestrial bipedality from arboreal hand-assisted bipedality requires fewer transitions, and is also kinematically and kinetically more parsimonious...|$|R
40|$|A {{program was}} {{developed}} to simulate the individual tree photosynthesis of ten Pinus radiata D.

The model linked the sub-models of leaf level photosynthesis, crown shape, foliage area, foliage area density distribution, and light penetration probability within tree crowns together to estimate total net photosynthesis on individual tree level. This study was carried out at a radiata pine clonal experiment at the same site with the same treatment located at Dalethorpe, Canterbury, New Zealand. At leaf level, seasonal photosynthetic responses to light and temperature curves of 1 -, 2 - and 3 -year-old needles were measured under controlled environmental conditions in the field. Needle net photosynthetic rates did not show {{statistically significant differences between}} clones. Net photosynthesis decreased with leaf age but increased with temperature (5 °C - 20 °C). Comparing the maximum photosynthetic rates under the same measurement conditions, there were no statistically significant differences among the ten clones or according to crown position (<b>crown</b> level and <b>aspect</b> i. e. north-, south-, east-, and west-facing). In describing crown shape, a simple crown shape was developed. The model can be used to calculate crown radii, the maximum crown radius, the crown base radius, crown volume and vertical volume distribution of different needle age classes. Above-ground biomass and needle surface area were estimated. The total above-ground biomass and its allocation showed significantly difference among growth difference clones. Tree height was poorly correlated with total biomass production, but DBH was strong correlated with needle, branch and total biomass. The vertical distributions of needle biomass, needle surface area, and needle surface area density were studied according to age class. In estimating light penetration within tree crowns, a simple light penetration program was developed. The program was based on data from crown architecture analysis, geometrical analysis of the light penetration distance within crowns and models of crown shapes. The program can be used to estimate the probability of direct light penetration at any given sun zenith angle and diffuse light penetration at any given direction with azimuth angle ∠θ and elevation angle ∠β. With the developed individual tree net photosynthesis process model, the influence of foliage mass, crown shape, light penetration probability, incoming sun zenith angle, crown light extinction coefficient k-value and needle photosynthetic capacity on total tree net photosynthesis was studied. Simulation results indicated that foliage mass was an important factor influencing total tree photosynthetic rate. However, other factors, such as crown shape and needle photosynthetic capacity, all influenced the variation of total tree photosynthetic rates in various environment conditions...|$|R

He asked me if I really thought that men who were totally inexperienced in the affairs of government could conduct matters properly,--an old and favourite appeal with the disciples of political exclusion. I endeavoured to persuade him that the art of administering was no great art; that there was more danger of rulers knowing too much than of their knowing too little, old soldiers proverbially taking better care of themselves than young soldiers; that he must not expect too much, for they that know the practices of free governments, well know it is hopeless to think of keeping pure and disinterested men long in office, even as men go, there being a corrupting influence about the very exercise of power that forbids the hope; and that all which shrewd observers look for in popular institutions is a greater check than common on the selfishness of those to whom authority is confided. I told him the man who courts popular favour in a republic, would court a prince in a monarchy, the elements of a demagogue and a courtier being exactly the same; and that, under either system, except in extraordinary instances, it was useless to attempt excluding such men from authority, since their selfishness was more active than the feelings of the disinterested; that, in our own case, so long as the impetus of the revolution and the influence of great events lasted, we had great men in the ascendant, but, now that matters were jogging on regularly, and under their common-place aspects, we were obliged to take up with merely clever managers; that one of the wisest men that had ever lived (Bacon) had said, that [...] "few men rise to power in a state, without a union of great and mean qualities," [...] and that this was probably as true at Berne as it is at Washington, and as true at Paris as at either; that the old system in his country savoured too much of the policy of giving the milk of two cows to one calf, and that he must remember it was a system that made very bad as well as very good veal, whereas for ordinary purposes it was better to have the same quantity of merely good veal; and, in short, that he himself would soon be surprised at discovering how soon the new rulers would acquire all the useful habits of their predecessors, and I advised him to look out that they did not acquire some of their bad ones too.|$|R
