5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, <b>current</b> <b>is</b> {{often described}} as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating <b>current</b> <b>is</b> any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of}} a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating <b>current</b> <b>is</b> zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating <b>current</b> <b>is</b> affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Bain, a Scottish {{clock and}} {{instrument}} maker, {{was the first}} to invent and patent the electric clock in 1840. On January 11, 1841, Alexander Bain along with John Barwise, a chronometer maker, took out another important patent describing a clock in which an electromagnetic pendulum and an electric <b>current</b> <b>is</b> employed to keep the clock going instead of springs or weights. Later patents expanded on his original ideas.|$|E
5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} <b>current</b> <b>is</b> defined {{as having the}} same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, {{one of the most}} familiar forms of <b>current,</b> <b>is</b> thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E

40|$|Three {{distinct}} K$ sp+$ <b>currents</b> <b>were</b> {{identified in}} corn (Zea mays) protoplasts using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Inward-rectifying K$ sp+$ <b>currents</b> <b>were</b> evoked at membrane potentials more negative than $-$ 100 mV. The activation range was sensitive to external K$ sp+$ and shifted in the positive direction as the K$ sp+$ concentration was elevated. The second K$ sp+$ <b>current</b> <b>was</b> voltage-independent {{and contributed to}} the resting membrane conductance of the protoplast. Finally, a voltage- and Ca$ sp{ 2 +}$-dependent K$ sp+$ <b>current</b> <b>was</b> observed at potentials positive to $-$ 60 mV. This <b>current</b> <b>was</b> inhibited by reagents which antagonize plasmalemma Ca$ sp{ 2 +}$ influx (e. g. nitrendipine, verapamil). In contrast, <b>currents</b> <b>were</b> enhanced by increasing the cytosolic free Ca$ sp{ 2 +}$ concentration from 40 to 400 nM. The Ca$ sp{ 2 +}$-dependent K$ sp+$ <b>current</b> <b>was</b> inhibited by tetraethylammonium ions, Cs$ sp+$, Ba$ sp{ 2 +}$, and charybdotoxin which suggested that the channel protein has structural similarities to the high conductance Ca$ sp{ 2 +}$-dependent K$ sp+$ channel observed in animal systems...|$|R

One class of <b>currents</b> <b>is</b> based on generators of the de Rham cohomology ring of $G/H$; a second class of <b>currents</b> <b>are</b> higher-spin generalizations of the (super) energy-momentum tensor.

5|$|Wet {{deposits}} of ash on high voltage insulators can initiate a leakage current (small amount of current flow across the insulator surface) which, if sufficient <b>current</b> <b>is</b> achieved, can cause ‘flashover’ (the unintended electrical discharge around {{or over the}} surface of an insulating material).|$|E
5|$|When welding {{dissimilar}} metals, {{the joint}} {{must have an}} accurate fit, with proper gap dimensions and bevel angles. Care {{should be taken to}} avoid melting excessive base material. Pulsed <b>current</b> <b>is</b> particularly useful for these applications, as it helps limit the heat input. The filler metal should be added quickly, and a large weld pool should be avoided to prevent dilution of the base materials.|$|E
5|$|Besides gyres, {{there are}} {{temporary}} surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore <b>current</b> <b>is</b> created as water is pushed along {{parallel to the}} coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach {{at right angles to}} the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the longshore <b>current</b> <b>is.</b> These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of , can form at different places at different stages of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E

5|$|Just {{like the}} many uses of plasma, {{there are several}} means for its generation, however, one {{principle}} is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it.

5|$|One of {{the most}} common types of arc welding is {{shielded}} metal arc welding (SMAW); it is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMA) or stick welding. Electric <b>current</b> <b>is</b> used to strike an arc between the base material and consumable electrode rod, which is made of filler material (typically steel) and is covered with a flux that protects the weld area from oxidation and contamination by producing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas during the welding process. The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary.|$|E
40|$|Membrane {{currents}} in the muscle fibre of larval mealworm, Tenebrio molitor were investigated under voltage-clamp conditions. An initial inward current, a transient outward current and a delayed outward <b>current</b> <b>were</b> distinguished. Increasing external calcium concentration increased {{the size of}} the inward current and shifted the reversal potential in a positive direction. The inward current persisted in Na-free media and TTX-saline. However, the <b>current</b> <b>was</b> suppressed by 15 mM-cobalt ions. Therefore, it was concluded that the inward <b>current</b> <b>was</b> carried by calcium ions. Although the inward <b>current</b> <b>was</b> markedly reduced when external sodium was replaced with glucose, it was concluded that the contribution of Na ions to the <b>current</b> <b>was</b> small.

5|$|The {{electrolysis}} {{of water}} is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A low voltage <b>current</b> <b>is</b> run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 80–94%.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons {{of the solar}} wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind {{is greater than the}} speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring <b>current</b> <b>is</b> defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimitedIn {{conjunction with the}} Huntington Beach Phase III Investigation, the diurnal variability {{in the wind and}} ocean currents from July 1 - October 12, 2001 over the San Pedro Shelf is investigated. Results suggest that the diurnal <b>currents</b> <b>are</b> driven by the diurnal winds but that the strength of the ocean response is modulated by the low frequency flow regime. The spectral peak of the near-surface <b>currents</b> <b>is</b> at the diurnal frequency, which is below the inertial frequency (1. 107 cpd). The diurnal <b>currents</b> <b>are</b> surface-intensified, decaying with depth to a minimum at 10 - 13 m and increasing slightly in strength below that. The near-surface diurnal <b>currents</b> <b>are</b> in phase across the shelf, and are close to in phase with the winds over the shelf.

5|$|The {{power supply}} used in SMAW has {{constant}} current output, {{ensuring that the}} current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of SMAW are manual, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult. However, because the <b>current</b> <b>is</b> not maintained absolutely constant, skilled welders performing complicated welds can vary the arc length to cause minor fluctuations in the current.|$|E
5|$|Welders often {{develop a}} {{technique}} of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance the weld pool) and adding filler metal. The filler rod is {{withdrawn from the}} weld pool each time the electrode advances, but it is always kept inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of the weld. Filler rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, require that the operator maintain {{some distance from the}} arc while staying inside the gas shield. If held too close to the arc, the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld puddle. As the weld nears completion, the arc <b>current</b> <b>is</b> often gradually reduced to allow the weld crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks {{at the end of the}} weld.|$|E
5|$|A voltage {{applied to}} a human body causes an {{electric}} current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with {{the path of the}} current, but is about 0.1mA to 1mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the <b>current</b> <b>is</b> sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.|$|E
