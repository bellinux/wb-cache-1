5|$|Until the 19th century Rivington was a rural village {{built around}} {{what is now}} the village green. Its {{inhabitants}} were employed in agriculture on scattered local farms, hand loom weaving in their own homes, working in the local quarries or the small coal mines on Winter Hill Coal mining was on a very small scale. Nicholas Fish, Brooker and Company had a coal pit on Wilders Moor that was mentioned on the 1869 and 1880 mines lists. in 1896 the Rivington Moor Colliery employed two workers mining coal from the Mountain <b>coal</b> <b>seam</b> for own or local use.|$|E
5|$|The geology of the Riverina {{comprises}} several troughs and sedimentary basins. The western Riverina {{is presumed}} to be {{a continuation of the}} Ballarat and Bendigo geological zone while eastern sections are underlain by western portions of the Lachlan Fold Belt. There is potential for the Riverina to host several mineral deposit types including coal, petroleum, <b>coal</b> <b>seam</b> methane, gypsum, orogenic gold, Cobar style polymetallic systems, heavy mineral sands and possibly diamonds in these fold belt rocks and basins. Riverina soils are generally sandy along the river channels, with more saline grey and brown clays found on rarely flooded areas on the perimeter of the floodplain. As the Murrumbidgee passes downstream, the water and soil become more saline.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCoal {{production}} in China accounts for 1 / 3 of total output in the world, and {{nearly half of}} China’s output is extracted in thick <b>coal</b> <b>seams.</b> Therefore, it is significant to study fully mechanized mining technology in thick <b>coal</b> <b>seams.</b> The development, current situation, and issue of slicing mining, top-coal caving, and <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> cutting sufficient height with fully mechanized mining technology are systematically analyzed in this paper. According to result of analysis, the prospect of development of fully mechanized mining technology in thick <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> is discussed. Especially, authors have represented the key problems which block the development of fully mechanized mining technology in thick <b>coal</b> <b>seams...</b>|$|R
5|$|In <b>coal</b> <b>seams,</b> <b>coal</b> {{balls are}} {{completely}} surrounded by coal. They are often found randomly {{scattered throughout the}} seam in isolated groups, usually in {{the upper half of}} the seam. Their occurrence in <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> can be either extremely sporadic or regular; many <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> have been found to contain no coal balls, while others have been found to contain so many coal balls that miners avoid the area entirely.|$|R
40|$|Petrographic {{composition}} of <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> {{is discussed in}} connection with the rate of subsidence in some Australian sedimentary basins. Cyclic variation of floor/dirt band-•vitrinite-rich coal-'>vitrinite-poor coal-•dirt band/roof can be seen within a <b>seam.</b> <b>Coal</b> <b>seams</b> deposited under unstable conditions are composed of incomplete cycles which lack vitrinite-poor coal, and so are rich in vitrinite, while <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> deposited under stable conditions are composed of a few complete cycles, and are rela-tively poor in vitrinite. Such a contrast between <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> can be seen within a sedi-mentary basin such as the Sydney Basin in Australia. <b>Coal</b> <b>seams</b> in "shelf sediments" on the stable basement rocks are, for the same reason, much poorer in vitrinite than those deposited under more variable conditions...|$|R
5|$|The soils in {{the lower}} part of the Kettle Creek {{watershed}} are highly acidic, deep, and well-drained. A total of 22 percent of the surface rock in this area is interbedded sedimentary rock, while sandstone makes up 78 percent. The Lower Kittanning <b>coal</b> <b>seam</b> is found in the Kettle Creek watershed. Rock formations in the Kettle Creek watershed include the Huntley Mountain Formation, the Burgoon Sandstone, the Pottsville Group, and the Allegheny Group. The Huntley Mountain Formation is from the Devonian period and the Mississippian epoch. The Burgoon Sandstone is from the Mississippian epoch and the Allegheny and Pottsville Groups are from the Pennsylvanian epoch. The Allegheny Group is the only rock formation in the watershed to contain coal that is economically worth mining.|$|E
25|$|Disused {{coal mines}} {{can also cause}} issues. Subsidence can occur above tunnels, causing damage to {{infrastructure}} or cropland. Coal mining can also cause long lasting fires, {{and it has been}} estimated that thousands of <b>coal</b> <b>seam</b> fires are burning at any given time. For example, there is a <b>coal</b> <b>seam</b> fire in Germany that has been burning since 1668, and is still burning in the 21st century.|$|E

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} novel and {{cost-effective}} approach to determine coalbed methane (CBM) production and composition from individual <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> in a multi-zone completed CBM well. The novel method uses {{water to cover}} individual <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> in a low pressure CBM well followed by an Echometer fluid level survey to determine the water level. Corresponding gas flow measurements and natural gas chromatography analysis are used to determine gas production and composition from unique zones. A field test using this technology is conducted in Central Appalachia for a multi-zone CBM well containing 18 <b>coal</b> <b>seams.</b> Test {{results show that the}} shallow <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> contribute the majority of the total CBM production in this multi-zone well, and the deeper <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> contain more heavy hydrocarbons like ethane and propane...|$|R

40|$|Partial {{burning of}} three {{bituminous}} <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB) of the Czech Republic was modeled by the numerical {{solution of the}} nonlinear initial-boundary value problem for a heat equation. It was assumed that a variegated beds body (VBB) formed around burned out <b>coal</b> <b>seams.</b> In addition, laboratory results for thermal alteration and oxidation of rocks were considered in addition to thermally altered coal from {{the vicinity of the}} variegated beds body. Models of two variegated beds profiles with three <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> were derived with FEMLAB using the finite elements method for the discretization in space along with the method of lines. Maximum temperatures within burned out <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> ranged from about 350 to 800 °C inside the variegated beds body, whereas outside the body they were below 350 °C. It took about 2000 years for all <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> to burn out. The calculated results show very good geologic credibility of the derived model...|$|R
25|$|Highwall mining {{is another}} form of surface mining that evolved from auger mining. In Highwall mining, the <b>coal</b> <b>seam</b> is {{penetrated}} by a continuous miner propelled by a hydraulic Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM). A typical cycle includes sumping (launch-pushing forward) and shearing (raising and lowering the cutterhead boom to cut the entire height of the <b>coal</b> <b>seam).</b> As the coal recovery cycle continues, the cutterhead is progressively launched into the <b>coal</b> <b>seam</b> for 19.72 feet (6.01 m). Then, the Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM) automatically inserts a 19.72-foot (6.01 m) long rectangular Pushbeam (Screw-Conveyor Segment) into the center section of the machine between the Powerhead and the cutterhead. The Pushbeam system can penetrate nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) into the <b>coal</b> <b>seam.</b> One patented Highwall mining system uses augers enclosed inside the Pushbeam that prevent the mined coal from being contaminated by rock debris during the conveyance process. Using a video imaging and/or a gamma ray sensor and/or other Geo-Radar systems like a coal-rock interface detection sensor (CID), the operator can see ahead projection of the seam-rock interface and guide the continuous miner's progress. Highwall mining can produce {{thousands of tons of}} coal in contour-strip operations with narrow benches, previously mined areas, trench mine applications and steep-dip seams with controlled water-inflow pump system and/or a gas (inert) venting system.|$|E

30|$|For {{the purpose}} of CO 2 {{emission}} reduction, CO 2 must be stored in coal permanently, the <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> used for storing CO 2 should be unmineable forever, otherwise, coal mining, combustion, or gasification would release CO 2 stored in the coal. The definition of unmineable coal is crucial for capacity evaluation and storage site characterization. However, universally accepted quantitative definition of unmineable <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> does not yet exist. Coal that is considered unmineable because of geologic, technological, and economic factors (typically too deep, too thin, or lacking the internal continuity to be economically mined with today’s technologies) may have potential for CO 2 storage (U.S. DOE 2012). In many capacity evaluation literatures, unmineable <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> usually refer to <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> at maximum buried depth of 800 or 1, 000  m (Bachu 2007). DOE’s Big Sky Carbon Sequestration Partnership (BSCSP) and Plains CO 2 Reduction (PCOR) Partnership define coal as unmineable if it is beneath at least 305  m of overburden. DOE’s Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium (MGSC) adds two considerations to their definition: all coals shallower than 152  m are mineable and so are unsuitable for CO 2 sequestration, and at 152 – 305  m deep, <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> 0.5 – 1.1  m thick are unmineable and so are reasonable sequestration targets (U.S. DOE 2010). (Fang and Li 2013 a) defined <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> buried at the depth of 1, 000 – 2, 000  m in China as unmineable <b>coal</b> <b>seams</b> for CO 2 storage capacity evaluation.|$|R
