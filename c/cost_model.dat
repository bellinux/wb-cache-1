5|$|In {{the uniform}} <b>cost</b> <b>model</b> (suitable for {{analyzing}} {{the complexity of}} gcd calculation on numbers that fit into a single machine word), {{each step of the}} algorithm takes constant time, and Lamé's analysis implies that the total running time is also O(h). However, in a model of computation suitable for computation with larger numbers, the computational expense of a single remainder computation in the algorithm can be as large as O(h2). In this case the total time for all of the steps of the algorithm can be analyzed using a telescoping series, showing that it is also O(h2). Modern algorithmic techniques based on the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm for fast integer multiplication can be used to speed this up, leading to quasilinear algorithms for the GCD.|$|E

40|$|Target costing is a cost {{management}} {{system designed to}} develop products {{with a level of}} profitability deemed adequate to justify their production.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} {{a set of}} step‐wise regression models which can incorporate multiple factors in <b>modelling</b> the <b>costs</b> of office buildings. The models appeared to be more accurate than the traditional method. Design/methodology/approach: The {{data were collected from}} historical office building projects, which were then, adjusted using the construction price index. The step‐wise regression was conducted to produce the linear <b>cost</b> <b>models.</b> Findings: Seven RC office buildings and 11 steel office buildings in Hong Kong completed in different years were selected randomly to verify the accuracy of the regression models developed. The data of these buildings were not used {{in the development of the}} <b>cost</b> <b>models.</b> The result shows that the variability of percentage difference is ranging from − 4. 11 per cent (4. 11 per cent underestimate) to + 2. 74 per cent (2. 74 per cent overestimate) for RC office buildings. For steel office buildings, it ranges from − 6. 65 per cent (6. 65 per cent underestimate) to + 2. 78 per cent (2. 78 per cent overestimate). Research limitations/implications: This study {{presents a}} methodology that can be used in cost estimation of office buildings in Hong Kong at early stage of construction project. The regression <b>cost</b> <b>models</b> developed above are based on, in total, historical data of 30 completed office buildings in Hong Kong. The reliability of the <b>cost</b> <b>models</b> can be further improved by including more office buildings to develop the <b>cost</b> <b>models.</b> Furthermore, the application of <b>cost</b> <b>modelling</b> by regression analysis is not limited to office buildings. The same approach can be applied to residential and other non‐residential buildings as well. Regression <b>cost</b> <b>modelling,</b> with sufficient updating for new cost data available, can provide economic, quick and accurate cost estimation at early stage of construction projects. It will become rational guide supplementing judgmental forecast of cost advisors in near future. Originality/value: Step‐wise regression procedure was applied to develop the <b>cost</b> <b>models.</b> Jackknife re‐sampling was carried out and both of the models show stability. Cross‐validation shows that the developed regression models performed satisfactorily. The paper considers that it can provide economic, quick and accurate cost estimation at the early stage of construction project.
