40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} model {{investigating the}} hydrogen charging {{process in a}} combination reactor filled with both LaNi 4. 3 Al 0. 4 Mn 0. 3 and 2 LiNH 2 - 1. 1 MgH 2 - 0. 1 LiBH 4 - 3 wt. %ZrCoH 3 materials has been developed. The selected configuration is a cylindrical reactor of 32 cm of diameter where the MeH is filled in annular tubes separated from the complex hydride bed by a gas permeable layer. The diffusion of hydrogen towards the two storage media is ensured by filters embedded {{in the middle of}} the MeH <b>tubes</b> whereas the <b>coolant</b> <b>tubes</b> are placed in the centre of their triangular arrangement. Simulation results have shown that the charging process depends on the MeH reaction heat required for the initiation of the CxH reaction as well as the heat management once the complex hydride starts to store hydrogen. High hydrogen storage rates and short refueling times can be obtained by increasing the number of MeH and <b>coolant</b> <b>tubes</b> and ensuring an efficient heat removal at the peripheral area of the CxH media. A refueling time of 3 min is achieved for an optimum configuration of 49 MeH <b>tubes</b> and 96 <b>coolant</b> <b>tubes</b> while increasing the thermal conductivity of the CxH media to 3. 5 W/(m K).

40|$|A flight-weight {{radiative}} {{and actively}} cooled honeycomb sandwich panel (RACP) {{was subjected to}} multiple cycles of both radiant and aerothermal heating. The 0. 61 m by 1. 22 m test specimen incorporated essential features of a full scale 0. 61 m by 6. 10 m RACP designed to withstand a heat flux of 136 kW/sq m.

Heat shield temperatures reached 1080 K (1945 deg R), and cooled-panel temperatures reached 382 K (687 deg R) midway between <b>coolant</b> <b>tubes.</b> Simulation of the full scale panel indicated that the full scale RACP would perform as expected.

This manifold is attached to a pressure transducer that records the average static pressure...|$|E
40|$|Radioisotope {{thermoelectric}} generator (RTG) packages designed for space missions {{generally do not}} require active cooling. However, the heat they generate cannot remain inside of the launch vehicle bay and requires active removal. Therefore, before the Shuttle bay door is closed, the RTG <b>coolant</b> <b>tubes</b> attached to the heat rejection fins must be filled with water, which will circulate and remove most of {{the heat from the}} cargo bay. There is concern that charging a system at initial temperature around 200 C with water at 24 C can cause unacceptable thermal stresses in the RTG shell and fins. A computer model is developed to estimate the transient temperature distribution resulting from such charging. The thermal stresses resulting from the temperature gradients do not exceed the elastic deformation limit for the material. Since the simplified mathematical model for thermal stresses tends to overestimate stresses, it is concluded that the RTG can be cooled by introducing water at 24 C to the initially hot fin <b>coolant</b> <b>tubes</b> while the RTG is in the Shuttle cargo bay...|$|R

A design procedure for such panels {{has been developed}} by Bell Aerospace Company (Helenbrook and Anthony, 1971). This design procedure assumes a uniform heating rate to the panel, i. e., the variation of aerodynamic heating rate due to the cyclic wall temperature distribution, which results from the discrete <b>coolant</b> <b>tube</b> locations in such a panel, has been neglected. This study was made to determine if these variations were sufficiently large to cause variations in aerodynamic heating rate which would require coupling of boundary layer and conductive thermal analysis solutions...|$|E

The complex nature of the background emission spectrum for the mini-i. c. p. indicates that careful line selection criteria and background correction procedures should be employed. Extending the torch <b>coolant</b> <b>tube</b> {{to the bottom of}} the region being observed in the plasma proved to be the most effective method for reducing undesirable spectral band features. Acute changes in background emission levels with r. f. power and nebulizer gas flow rates emphasize the need for careful control of these parameters to achieve high precision.

The WME consists mainly of the following components: An outer stainless-steel screen that provides structural support for the components mentioned next; Inside and in contact with the stainless-steel screen, a hydrophobic membrane that is permeable to water vapor; Inside and in contact with the hydrophobic membrane, a hydrophilic membrane that transports the liquid feedwater to the inner surface of the hydrophobic membrane; Inside and in contact with the hydrophilic membrane, an annular array of tubes through which flows the spacecraft coolant carrying the heat to be dissipated; and An inner exclusion tube that limits the volume of feedwater in the WME. In operation, a pressurized feedwater reservoir is connected to the volume between the exclusion <b>tube</b> and the <b>coolant</b> <b>tubes.</b> Feedwater fills the volume, saturates the hydrophilic membrane, and is retained by the hydrophobic membrane. The outside of the WME is exposed to space vacuum.

40|$|Elements of an {{actively}} cooled structural {{panel for}} a hypersonic aircraft {{have been investigated}} for fatigue characteristics. The study involved a bonded honeycomb sandwich panel with d-shaped <b>coolant</b> <b>tubes.</b> The curved portion of these tubes was embedded in the honeycomb, and the flat portion was bonded or soldered to the inner surface of the outer skin. The elements examined were two plain skin specimens (aluminum alloy); two specimens with skins attached to manifolds and tubes (one specimen was bonded, the other soldered); and a specimen representative of a corner section of the complete cooled sandwich. Sinusoidal loads were applied to all specimens. The honeycomb sandwich specimen was loaded in both tension and compression; the other specimens were loaded in tension only. The cooling tubes were pressurized with oil throughout the fatigue tests. The most significant results of these tests follow: All specimens exceeded their design life of 20, 000 cycles without damage.

Blanket designs are developed for both circular plasma reactors (R = 6. 25 m, a = 2. 1 m) and non-circular plasma reactors (R = 4. 0 m, a = 1. 0 m, b = 3. 0 m). For each of these two reactor choices, two blanket options are described. 1) In the first option, the blanket is thick graphite block structure (approximately 50 cm thickness) with SAP <b>coolant</b> <b>tubes</b> carrying helium imbedded deep within the graphite to minimize radiation damage. The neutron and gamma energy deposited in the graphite is radiated along internal slots to the <b>coolant</b> <b>tubes</b> where approximately 80 percent of the fusion energy is carried off by He at 380 $sup 0 $C.
