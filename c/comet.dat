5|$|An {{alternative}} {{suggestion was}} that the comets were all fragments of an earlier Sun-grazing <b>comet.</b> This idea was first proposed in 1880, and its plausibility was amply demonstrated when the Great <b>Comet</b> of 1882 broke up into several fragments after its perihelion passage. In 1888, Heinrich Kreutz published a paper showing that the comets of 1843 (C/1843 D1, the Great March <b>Comet),</b> 1880 (C/1880 C1, the Great Southern <b>Comet),</b> and 1882 (C/1882 R1, Great September <b>Comet)</b> were probably fragments of a giant <b>comet</b> that had broken up several orbits before. The <b>comet</b> of 1680 proved to be unrelated to this family of comets.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} <b>comets</b> and the {{evolution}} of their orbits are discussed. Factors considered include: the law of survival of <b>comets</b> against ejection on hyperbolic orbits; short-period <b>comets</b> are not created by single close encounters of near-parabolic <b>comets</b> with Jupiter; observable long-period <b>comets</b> do not evolve into observable short-period comets; unobservable long-period <b>comets</b> with perihelia near Jupiter can evolve into observable short-period comets; long-period <b>comets</b> cannot have been formed or created within the planetary region of the solar system (excluding the effects of stellar perturbations); it is possible that some of the short-period <b>comets</b> could have been formed inside the orbit of Neptune; circularly-restricted three-body problem, and its associated Jacobi integral, are not valid approximations to use in studying origin and evolution of <b>comets...</b>|$|R
5|$|There are {{two main}} classes of comet: short-period <b>comets</b> (also called {{ecliptic}} <b>comets)</b> and long-period <b>comets</b> (also called nearly isotropic <b>comets).</b> Ecliptic <b>comets</b> have relatively small orbits, below 10AU, and follow the ecliptic plane, the same plane in which the planets lie. All long-period <b>comets</b> have very large orbits, {{on the order of}} thousands of AU, and appear from every direction in the sky. Oort noted that there was a peak in numbers of long-period <b>comets</b> with aphelia (their farthest distance from the Sun) of roughly 20,000AU, which suggested a reservoir at that distance with a spherical, isotropic distribution.|$|R
5|$|Development {{flying and}} route proving with the <b>Comet</b> 3 allowed {{accelerated}} certification {{of what was}} destined to be the most successful variant of the type, the <b>Comet</b> 4. All airline customers for the <b>Comet</b> 3 subsequently cancelled their orders and switched to the <b>Comet</b> 4, which was based on the <b>Comet</b> 3 but with improved fuel capacity. BOAC ordered 19 <b>Comet</b> 4s in March 1955, while American operator Capital Airlines ordered 14 Comets in July 1956. Capital's order included 10 <b>Comet</b> 4As, a variant modified for short-range operations with a stretched fuselage and short wings, lacking the pinion (outboard wing) fuel tanks of the <b>Comet</b> 4. However, because of financial problems and a subsequent takeover by United Airlines, Capital would never operate the <b>Comet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Halley's <b>Comet</b> or <b>Comet</b> Halley, officially {{designated}} 1P/Halley, is a short-period <b>comet</b> {{visible from}} Earth every 74–79 years.

5|$|The <b>Comet</b> 4 {{was ordered}} by two other airlines: Aerolíneas Argentinas took {{delivery}} of six <b>Comet</b> 4s from 1959 to 1960, using them between Buenos Aires and Santiago, New York and Europe, while East African Airways received three new <b>Comet</b> 4s from 1960 to 1962 and operated {{them to the}} United Kingdom and to Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The <b>Comet</b> 4A ordered by Capital Airlines was instead built for BEA as the <b>Comet</b> 4B with a further fuselage stretch of 38in (97cm) and seating for 99 passengers. The first <b>Comet</b> 4B flew on 27 June 1959 and BEA began Tel Aviv to London-Heathrow services on 1 April 1960. Olympic Airways {{was the only other}} customer to order the type. The last <b>Comet</b> 4 variant, the <b>Comet</b> 4C, first flew on 31 October 1959 and entered service with Mexicana in 1960. The <b>Comet</b> 4C had the <b>Comet</b> 4B's longer fuselage and the longer wings and extra fuel tanks of the original <b>Comet</b> 4, which gave it a longer range than the 4B. Ordered by Kuwait Airways, Middle East Airlines, Misrair (later United Arab Airlines), and Sudan Airways, it was the most popular <b>Comet</b> variant.|$|E

50|$|Observations of Hartley 2 {{showed the}} {{importance}} of carbon-monoxide ice to carbon-dioxide ice in <b>comets.</b> After a reexamination, {{it was found that}} the abundances of carbon-monoxide ice and carbon dioxide ice show that short-period <b>comets</b> formed under warmer conditions, than the longer period <b>comets.</b> This shows that the short-period <b>comets</b> formed closer to the Sun, than the long-term <b>comets.</b> This discovery goes well with the measurements of Heavy Water in Hartley 2.|$|R
5|$|After Edmund Halley {{demonstrated}} that the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 were the same body and successfully predicted its return in 1759 by calculating its orbit, that <b>comet</b> became known as Halley's <b>Comet.</b> Similarly, {{the second and third}} known periodic comets, Encke's <b>Comet</b> and Biela's <b>Comet,</b> were named after the astronomers who calculated their orbits rather than their original discoverers. Later, periodic comets were usually named after their discoverers, but comets that had appeared only once continued to be referred to by the year of their appearance.|$|E
5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, the <b>comet</b> {{moved into}} the southern celestial hemisphere. The <b>comet</b> was much less impressive to southern hemisphere observers {{than it had been}} in the northern hemisphere, but southerners were able to see the <b>comet</b> gradually fade from view during the second half of 1997. The last naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that the <b>comet</b> had remained visible without aid for 569days, or about 18 and a half months. The previous record had been set by the Great <b>Comet</b> of 1811, which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.|$|E
5|$|Approximately once a decade, a <b>comet</b> becomes {{bright enough}} to be noticed by a casual observer, leading such comets to be {{designated}} as great comets. Predicting whether a <b>comet</b> will become a great <b>comet</b> is notoriously difficult, as many factors may cause a comet's brightness to depart drastically from predictions. Broadly speaking, if a <b>comet</b> has a large and active nucleus, will pass close to the Sun, and is not obscured by the Sun {{as seen from the}} Earth when at its brightest, it has a chance of becoming a great <b>comet.</b> However, <b>Comet</b> Kohoutek in 1973 fulfilled all the criteria and was expected to become spectacular but failed to do so. <b>Comet</b> West, which appeared three years later, had much lower expectations but became an extremely impressive <b>comet.</b>|$|E

40|$|Remote {{investigations}} of the ancient solar system matter has been traditionally carried out through the observations of long-period (LP) <b>comets</b> that are less affected by solar irradiation than the short-period counterparts orbiting {{much closer to the}} Sun. Here we summarize the results of our decade-long survey of the distant activity of LP <b>comets.</b> We found that the most important separation in the dataset is based on the dynamical nature of the objects. Dynamically new <b>comets</b> are characterized by a higher level of activity on average: the most active new <b>comets</b> in our sample can be characterized by afrho values > 3 [...] 4 higher than that of our most active returning <b>comets.</b> New <b>comets</b> develop more symmetric comae, suggesting a generally isotropic outflow. Contrary to this, the coma of recurrent <b>comets</b> can be less symmetrical, ocassionally exhibiting negative slope parameters, suggesting sudden variations in matter production.

500|$|Halley is {{classified}} as a periodic or short-period comet; one with an orbit lasting 200 years or less. This contrasts it with long-period <b>comets,</b> whose orbits last for thousands of years. Periodic <b>comets</b> have an average inclination to the ecliptic of only ten degrees, and an orbital period of just 6.5 years, so Halley's orbit is atypical. Most short-period <b>comets</b> (those with orbital periods shorter than 20 years and inclinations of 20–30 degrees or less) are called Jupiter-family <b>comets.</b> Those resembling Halley, with orbital periods of between 20 and 200 years and inclinations extending from zero to more than 90 degrees, are called Halley-type <b>comets.</b> [...] , only 75 Halley-type <b>comets</b> have been observed, compared with 511 identified Jupiter family <b>comets.</b>|$|R
