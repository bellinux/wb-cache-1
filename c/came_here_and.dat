500|$|On {{election}} night, after Coakley conceded, Brown gave {{a victory}} speech that stated, [...] "It {{all started with}} me, my truck, and a few dedicated volunteers. It ended with Air Force One making an emergency run to Logan. I didn't mind when President Obama <b>came</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> criticized me– that happens in campaigns. But when he criticized my truck, that's where I draw the line." [...] Brown's upset win stunned the national Democratic party, and foreshadowed nationwide success for Republicans in 2010.|$|E
500|$|In the 1920s, the local-born Chinese, who {{retained}} {{significant economic}} power, began {{pushing for a}} greater role in Malayan government. Much of the Chinese community, which now made up 45% of the Malayan population, still comprised transient labourers. Nevertheless, the Straits Chinese — which comprised the bulk of local-born Chinese — wanted to be given government positions and recognised as Malayans. One Straits Chinese leader asked, [...] "Who said this is a Malay country? ... When Captain [...] Light arrived, did he find Malays, or Malay villages? Our forefathers <b>came</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> worked hard as coolies — weren't ashamed to become coolies — and they didn't send their money back to China. They married and spent their money here, and in this way the Government was able to open up the country from jungle to civilization. We've become inseparable from this country. It's ours, our country..." [...] Malay intellectuals objected to this reasoning, claiming that such reasoning is totally absurd and proposing an analogy with the Chinese as masons and Malaya as a house. A paid mason, they argued, was not entitled to a share in the ownership rights to a home he built. As such, they opposed any attempt to grant the Chinese citizenship or other political rights.|$|E

500|$|Bowyer {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first win {{of the season in}} front of 95,000 people who attended the race. Bowyer also earned $248,250 in race winnings. Stewart took his last-minute loss of the race with good humor, saying, [...] "We went down swinging. I think I ran me out of fuel." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "First thing I asked is how many cars on the lead lap, because I wanted to see how bad our day was going to be. I set a goal (of) top 15, and then it was top eight and then top six and, 'Holy cow, we can win this thing.' We just made a heck of a charge at the end." [...] Bowyer was delighted with his victory: [...] " [...] Shane [...] built a brand new race car and we <b>came</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> we were fast right off the truck, and everybody had a lot of confidence, a pep in their step. And we showed it from the time we unloaded to qualifying, practice, we were one of the fastest cars here.

I know it’s the key, I know it is to my success." ...|$|E
