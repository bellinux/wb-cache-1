5|$|Workers {{building}} the dam received {{an average of}} 80¢ an hour; the payroll for the dam was among {{the largest in the}} nation. The workers were mainly pulled from Grant, Lincoln, Douglas, and Okanogan counties and women were allowed to work only in the dorms and the cookhouse. Around 8,000 people worked on the project, and Frank A. Banks served as the chief construction engineer. Bert A. Hall was the chief inspector who would accept the dam from the contractors. Orin G. Patch served as the chief of <b>concrete.</b> <b>Construction</b> conditions were dangerous and 77 workers died.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 {{the club}} {{moved to the}} Portway Stadium, {{situated}} in the Portway Industrial Estate on the western outskirts of the town. Built {{at a cost of}} £850,000, the ground has a main stand of brick and <b>concrete</b> <b>construction</b> with bench seating for around 250 people. This stand is set on a bank running along the entire south side of the ground, giving spectators on that side an elevated view of the pitch. The managers' benches are set into this banking in front of the stand at pitch level. The banking slopes down behind each goal until it reaches the same level as the pitch along the north side. There is hard standing around the entire perimeter of pitch, along with a turnstile block and a gate opening out onto the stadium car park for ambulance access.|$|E

5|$|The {{designers}} {{of the tracks}} at Altenberg and Oberhof, East Germany, the Olympic tracks in La Plagne, France, and Calgary, Canada, were consulted during planning. Five companies bid for the <b>concrete</b> <b>construction</b> work, which was awarded to {{a joint venture between}} Aker Entreprenør and Veidekke for NOK45 million. Also the construction of the buildings was awarded to the same group. The track {{was the first of the}} Olympic venues for the 1994 games for which construction started. After construction started, Minister of Culture Åse Kleveland (Labour Party) suggested in March 1991, in an attempt to reduce costs, that the 1994 Olympic bobsleigh and luge events be held at La Plagne, the site of the events for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville. The French authorities were positive, given that Norway pay for part of the construction costs, but the idea was rejected by LOOC-president Gerhard Heiberg. Also fellow party members reacted, who emphasized that NOK30 million had already been used on blasting the track route.|$|E

25|$|<b>Concrete</b> <b>construction</b> is {{prevalent}} among {{the homes and}} buildings in Scales Mound. Adam Rittweger constructed numerous distinctive concrete porches, garages, and foundations between 1908 and his death in 1933. There are several surviving examples of poured concrete constructed buildings in Scales Mound including the 1923 one story electrical generating plant, and Lewis Richard's 1911 restaurant. There is one surviving example in Scales Mound of a stucco clad and poured <b>concrete</b> <b>construction</b> combination, Louis Durrstein's implement dealership. It is presumed that Rittweger also introduced stucco finishes to Scales Mound between the late 1900s and early 1910s.|$|E

25|$|Before 1877 {{the use of}} <b>concrete</b> <b>construction,</b> though {{dating back}} to the Roman Empire and reintroduced in the mid to late 1800s, was not yet a proven {{scientific}} technology. American New Yorker Thaddeus Hyatt published a report titled An Account of Some Experiments with Portland-Cement-Concrete Combined with Iron as a Building Material, with Reference to Economy of Metal in Construction and for Security against Fire in the Making of Roofs, Floors, and Walking Surfaces where he stated his experiments on the behavior of reinforced concrete.

25|$|The {{concept of}} a {{skyscraper}} {{is a product of}} the industrialized age, made possible by cheap fossil fuel derived energy and industrially refined raw materials such as steel and concrete. The construction of skyscrapers was enabled by steel frame construction that surpassed brick and mortar construction starting at the end of the 19th century and finally surpassing it in the 20th century together with reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>construction</b> as the price of steel decreased and labour costs increased.|$|E
25|$|In {{steel plate}} construction, {{stringers}} join parallel steel plates. The plate assemblies are fabricated off site, and welded together on-site to form steel walls connected by stringers. The walls become the form into which concrete is poured. Steel plate construction speeds reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>construction</b> by cutting out the time-consuming on-site manual steps of tying rebar and building forms. The method results in excellent strength because the steel {{is on the}} outside, where tensile forces are often greatest.|$|E

25|$|The gun emplacements are symmetrical, {{single-storeyed}} {{structures of}} off-form concrete, waffle slab roof supported on three columns with earth fill on top, Australian-designed circular recoil pit with central pad and outlying rail for gun carriage traverse, side magazines {{of concrete and}} concrete block construction. Camouflage net pivot points are extant, and doors remain on the lower emplacement magazines. The robust off-form <b>concrete</b> <b>construction</b> is unlike the two-storeyed coastal battery gun emplacements of Moreton Bay, where timber as well as concrete was used structurally.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} {{unexpected}} challenges to cope with: In November, 1997, an El Niño weather front dumped {{two inches of}} rain in two hours, flooding the NIF site with 200,000 gallons of water just {{three days before the}} scheduled concrete foundation pour. The earth was so soaked that the framing for the retaining wall sank six inches, forcing the crew to disassemble and reassemble it in order to pour the <b>concrete.</b> <b>Construction</b> was halted in December, 1997, when 16,000-year-old mammoth bones were discovered on the construction site. Paleontologists were called in to remove and preserve the bones, and construction restarted within four days.|$|E
25|$|Some of the extravagances of the Domus Aurea had repercussions for the future. The architects {{designed}} two of {{the principal}} dining rooms to flank an octagonal court, surmounted by a dome with a giant central oculus to let in light. It was an early use of Roman <b>concrete</b> <b>construction.</b> One innovation was destined to have an enormous influence {{on the art of}} the future: Nero placed mosaics, previously restricted to floors, in the vaulted ceilings. Only fragments have survived, but that technique was to be copied extensively, eventually ending up as a fundamental feature of Christian art: the apse mosaics that decorate so many churches in Rome, Ravenna, Sicily and Constantinople.|$|E

25|$|Two {{historic}} bridges {{cross the}} River Teme at Ludlow — Ludford Bridge (a Scheduled Ancient Monument) and Dinham Bridge (early 19th century, Grade II listed) — {{both of which}} still take vehicular traffic as no modern bridges have been built over the Teme in the area. To {{the north of the}} town centre, the historic Corve Bridge crosses the River Corve, and this bridge was relieved by Burway Bridge in the mid-20th century. However, on 26 June 2007, dramatic flooding on the Corve caused the Burway Bridge to collapse, severing a gas main and causing 20 homes in nearby Corve Street to be evacuated. The old stone bridge has now been replaced with a modern steel and pre-fabricated <b>concrete</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the {{depression}} between Branstree and High Howes {{is a small}} tarn {{and the remains of}} a survey pillar. This unusual stone and <b>concrete</b> <b>construction</b> is cleft at the top to provide a sight line and was originally surrounded by a wooden frame, now decayed. This is one of four such pillars built during the construction of the Haweswater aqueduct. Below Branstree, Tarn Crag and Great Howe is the first section of the pipeline carrying water from the reservoir toward Manchester. The tunnel, some 1,300ft below this point, required 250 tons of gelignite for blasting, and when constructed in the 1930s was the longest such pipeline in Britain. It emerges into Longsleddale below the southern end of Great Howe, where the spoil can still be seen.|$|E
25|$|A former {{employee}} of Kenzo Tange was Arata Isozaki who was initially {{interested in the}} Metabolist Movement and produced innovative theoretical projects for the City in the Air (1961) and Future City (1962). However he soon moved away from this towards a more Mannerist approach similar {{to the work of}} James Stirling. This was particularly striking at the Oita Branch for Fukuoka Mutual (1967) with its mathematical grids, <b>concrete</b> <b>construction</b> and exposed services. In the Gunma Prefectural Museum (1971–74) he experimented with cubic elements (some of them twelve metres to a side) overlaid by a secondary grid expressed by the external wall panels and fenestration. This rhythm of panelling may have been influenced by Corbusier's detailing on the Museum of Western Art in Tōkyō.|$|E
