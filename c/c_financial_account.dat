40|$|The lack of {{strategies}} for effective financial management {{has been an}} impediment to the survival and growth of many small businesses in Saint Vincent (St. Vincent), {{an island in the}} Caribbean. Inadequate adoption {{of strategies}} by small business owners is a prime contributing factor to small business failure. The purpose of this research was to identify strategies that small business owners use for effective financial management. Institutional theory served as the conceptual framework for this multiple case study. Participants consisted of 4 St. Vincent small business owners who had demonstrated effective financial management strategies in the operation of their businesses.

40|$|In its Conceptual Framework (CF), the <b>Financial</b> <b>Accounting</b> Standards Board (FASB) has not {{identified}} the observable phenomena {{and was not}} able to identify a single measurement property in <b>financial</b> <b>accounting.</b> While identifying aspects of the observable phenomena in <b>financial</b> <b>accounting,</b> the FASB has indicated that there are five measurement attributes which are used in <b>financial</b> <b>accounting</b> and the result is a mixed-attributes model. Lacking a critical underlying theory, the FASB’s Conceptual Framework is feeble at best in providing guidance for accounting measurement. Devoid of the critical theory, the FASB focuses on prediction rather than explanation and, thereby, has adopted an ‘information perspective’ as opposed to a ‘measurement perspective’ for <b>financial</b> <b>accounting</b> standards.
