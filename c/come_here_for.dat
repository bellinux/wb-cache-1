2500|$|Most of {{the killings}} at camp were {{carried out by the}} Gestapo. Those {{committed}} by the SP UGB and the SDS were carried out under the orders of Belgrade police commissioner Svetozar Vujković, a noted sadist who collaborated enthusiastically with the Germans, interrogated prisoners and devised a number of humiliating torture techniques. [...] Vujković had been a high-ranking official in the pre-war Belgrade police. He was involved in the persecution of Yugoslavia's communists even before the outbreak of World War II. Executions occurred frequently at Vujković's whim and he rarely asked for approval from German or Serbian authorities to carry out murders. He purportedly ordered the killing of prisoners even in cases where the Ministry of Interior decided against execution. Vujković is reported to have begged the Germans to [...] "personally shoot twenty young girls who were ordered for shooting" [...] on one occasion. Despite this, neither he nor any other Serbs holding positions of power in the camp were reprimanded or removed from their posts by the Serbian collaborationist government. When prisoners complained of lack of food, Vujković and his associates replied by saying: [...] " [...] didn't <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> spa therapy and food, but to be executed. To eat more or less will not save your lives." [...] The Belgrade Circuit Court sentenced him to death on November 1949.|$|E
