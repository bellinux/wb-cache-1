The regression models for testing six hypotheses confirm that call and put option investors have significant risk aversion preferences and expectations of market reversion. Put option investors' trading motivation involves hedging their long and short futures positions by a way of portfolio management, such as the establishment of portfolio insurance or <b>covered</b> <b>options.</b> The motivation underlying the call option trading behaviour is still ambiguous, however. moneyness, risk preference, trading motivation, VIX,...|$|R

The general formula not only covers existing cases but also enables the combination of diverse features from different types of exotic options. It also creates implicitly a language to describe payoffs {{that can be used}} in industrial applications to decouple the functions of payoff definition from pricing functions. Examples of several exotic options are presented, benchmarking the closed formulas' performance against Monte Carlo simulations. Results show a consistent over performance of the closed formula reducing calculation time by double digit factors.

40|$|Uncontrolled {{leachate}} generation from operational {{and closed}} waste disposal sites {{is a major}} environmental concern in the coastal regions of Ghana which have abundant surface water and groundwater resources. The Ghana Landfill Guidelines requires the provision of a final cover or capping system {{as part of a}} final closure plan for waste disposal sites in the country as a means of minimizing the harmful environmental effects of these emissions. However, this technical manual does not provide explicit guidance on the material types or configuration for landfill covers that would be suitable for the different climatic conditions in the country. Four landfill <b>cover</b> <b>options</b> which are based on the USEPA RCRA-type and evapotranspirative landfill cover design specifications were evaluated with the aid of the HELP computer program to determine their suitability for waste disposal sites located in the Western, Central and Greater Accra regions. The RCRA Subtitle C cover which yielded flux rates of less than 0. 001 mm/yr was found to be suitable for the specific climatic conditions. The RCRA Subtitle D cover was determined to be unsuitable due to the production of very large flux rates in excess of 200 mm/yr. The results for the anisotropic barrier and capillary barrier covers were inconclusive. Recommendations for further study include a longer simulation period as well the study of the combined effects of different topsoil vegetative conditions and evaporative zone depths on the landfill water balance. The use of other water balance models such as EPIC, HYDRUS- 2 D and UNSAT-H for the evaluation of the evapotranspirative landfill <b>cover</b> design <b>options</b> should also be considered...|$|R
40|$|MBA - WBSInvestors {{need to be}} {{informed}} about the return characteristics of various option strategies in order to benefit from additional investment opportunities provided by options. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine, from a historical perspective, the return, and associated risk, of using fully <b>covered</b> call <b>option</b> and protective put option strategies with the underlying portfolio of selected shares from the JSE Securities Exchange, South Africa (JSE). The objective of this study is to consider two option strategies - the covered call strategy and the protective put strategy. The former strategy involves writing a call option and buying the underlying stock, while the latter involves buying a put whilst holding underlying stock. The study compares the performance of the two strategies in a global investment strategy which combines diversification and hedging to the performance of a stock portfolio without options. The results from this study provide investment options and strategies across various levels of risk aversion while still maintaining a diversified portfolio. The stocks chosen were the top 40 listed shares on the JSE, measured by market capitalisation, and hypothesis testing was used to illustrate the differences in performance between portfolios. Results from this study showed that the combination of the underlying stocks with a fully <b>covered</b> call <b>option</b> strategy leads to returns similar to those of a portfolio of underlying stocks only, but the risk, as measured by standard deviation, is lower on a portfolio with fully <b>covered</b> call <b>options</b> when compared to a portfolio of underlying stocks only.

50|$|A {{split share}} {{corporation}} is a corporation that exists for a defined {{period of time}} to transform the risk and investment return (capital gains, dividends, and possibly also profits from the writing of <b>covered</b> <b>options)</b> of a basket of shares of conventional dividend-paying corporations into the risk and return of the two or more classes of publicly traded shares in the split share corporation. Most commonly a split share corporation issues equal numbers of shares from a class of preferred shares and a class of capital or class A shares. The proceeds of the share offering are invested in conventional dividend-paying shares according to the regulations of the split share corporation. The preferred shares typically offer relatively high and secure dividend yield at a fixed coupon rate but with no expectation of capital gain by the time that the split share corporation is wound up. The capital shares often (but not in every corporation) pay a dividend like the preferred shares; in addition, the capital shares offer participation in the leveraged capital gains (or losses) of the underlying basket of conventional shares.|$|R
