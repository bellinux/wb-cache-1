5|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> several additional factors enabled the GWA studies. One was the advent of biobanks, which are repositories of human genetic material that greatly reduced the cost and difficulty of collecting sufficient numbers of biological specimens for study. Another was the International HapMap Project, which, from 2003 identified {{a majority of the}} common SNPs interrogated in a GWA study. The haploblock structure identified by HapMap project also allowed the focus on the subset of SNPs that would describe most of the variation. Also the development of the methods to genotype all these SNPs using genotyping arrays was an important prerequisite.|$|E

40|$|Even though {{astronomy}} is {{the oldest}} science, it is still an open question how to evaluate students’ understanding in astronomy. In {{spite of the fact}} that some methods and evaluation tools have been developed for that purpose, the sources of students' difficulties in astronomy are still unclear. This paper presents an investigation of the changes in <b>conceptual</b> <b>frameworks</b> in astronomy among 50 engineering students as a result of learning a general course in astronomy. A special tool called <b>Conceptual</b> <b>Frameworks</b> in Astronomy (CFA), which was initially used in 1989, was adopted to gather data for the present research. In its new version, the tool includes 23 questions and five to six optional answers to each question. Each of the answers characterizes one of the four conceptual frameworks: pre-scientific, geocentric, heliocentric and sidereal. These four <b>conceptual</b> <b>frameworks</b> act as a taxonomical system that enables us to evaluate astronomical understanding. The paper describes the background of the CFA, its development, and discusses its validity and reliability. Using the CFA we were able to: (1) identify the students’ <b>conceptual</b> <b>frameworks</b> at the beginning of the course and at its end, (2) to evaluate the students’ paradigmatic change following the course. It was found that the measure of the students’ improvement (gain index) was g = 0. 37. Approximately 45 % of the students in the course improved their <b>conceptual</b> <b>frameworks</b> in astronomy and 26 % deepened their understanding of the heliocentric or sidereal <b>conceptual</b> <b>frameworks.</b> The CFA can also be applied as an evaluation tool in all schools and institutions that teach astronomy...|$|R
