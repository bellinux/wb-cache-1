50|$|The party {{attracted}} {{some support}} {{from members of}} the Progressive Conservative Party, Liberal Party, and the Social Credit Party. Some senior Social Credit Party officials attended and addressed Action Canada's conference held in Toronto in early October 1971, and Hellyer addressed the Social Credit national convention in Hull, Quebec, on October 9-10. Hellyer gave a 25-minute speech to the predominantly francophone convention, of which only two minutes were in English, explaining how wage and price controls combined with controls over monopoly industries would enable the government to ensure full employment, eliminate inflation, and provide a guaranteed annual income. He received applause for his <b>comments</b> about it <b>being</b> <b>Action</b> Canada policy that French-speaking Quebecers should be able to work in their own language.He did not try to convince party members to join his movement.|$|R
40|$|Many {{companies}} {{engage in}} behaviour that {{is intended to}} reduce, mitigate or avoid the amount of taxation {{that would otherwise be}} due. This behaviour may result in changes to the tax code of a country and in <b>comments</b> <b>being</b> made and <b>actions</b> undertaken by governments, academics and other interested parties. This thesis argues that there exists a lack of clarity, coherence and consistency when considering and seeking to understand the relationship between tax codes, companies and society. This thesis argues {{that it is necessary to}} critically examine the nature of the tax related behaviour and also to identify and describe the rights, duties and obligations that are associated with the type of organisation which can be identified as a UK incorporated limited company. It is further argued t hat such a critical examination will re quire consideration of the nature of a company and the role played by directors of a company. The thesis provides an explanatory framework for tax related behaviour and uses that framework to identify and describe various types of tax related behaviour. The thesis also provides a critical discussion of the nature of the corporation and argues for the existence of a core set of rights, duties and obligations which help to illuminate the relationship between a UK incorporated limited company, the tax code and society.
