50|$|Many of {{the best}} power hitters in {{baseball}} play in the outfield, where {{they do not have}} as constant involvement in fielding plays as other positions, especially before the institution of the designated hitter. For example, Babe Ruth was moved from pitcher to the outfield.

Center field is often considered the most difficult outfield position, requiring both a good throwing arm and speed. <b>Center</b> <b>fielders</b> on many teams often bat lead off.|$|R

Second baseman Cora dragged a bunt down the first base line and reached first base safely on an infield hit. Yankees manager Buck Showalter argued the call, believing Cora should have been called out for running off the baselines; however, the umpires' ruling stood. <b>Center</b> <b>fielder</b> Griffey singled to short right-center field, {{allowing}} Cora to reach third base. Designated hitter Martinez then doubled down the left field line, scoring Cora with the tying run and Griffey with the winning run. The Mariners' dugout emptied and mobbed Griffey, Martinez, and Cora on the field in celebration of the franchise's first ever playoff series victory.|$|E
