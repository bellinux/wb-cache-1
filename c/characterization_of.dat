40|$|Maxcliques (maximal {{complete}} subgraphs) and unit disks (closed {{neighborhoods of}} vertices) sometime play almost interchangeable roles in graph theory. For instance, interchanging them makes two existing <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> chordal graphs into two new characterizations. More intriguingly, these <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> chordal graphs can be naturally strengthened to new <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> strongly chordal graph...|$|R

30|$|<b>Characterizations</b> <b>of</b> {{distributions}} {{are important}} to many researchers in the applied fields. An investigator will be vitally interested to know if their model fits the requirements of a particular distribution. To this end, one {{will depend on the}} <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> this distribution which provide conditions under which the underlying distribution is indeed that particular distribution. Various <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> distributions have been established in many different directions. In this section, two main <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> the OGE family are presented. These characterizations are based on: (i) a simple relationship between two truncated moments; (ii) a single function of the random variable.|$|R

40|$|Logical <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> nondeterministic, probabilistic, and Markovian {{variants}} of bisimulation equivalence rely on similar modal languages, each including true, negation, conjunction, and diamond. Likewise, logical <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding {{variants of}} trace equivalence rely on similar modal languages, each including only true and diamond. Unfortunately, {{this is not}} the case with the existing logical <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding variants of testing equivalence, as they are based on different modal languages. In this paper we show that the logical <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> testing equivalences for fully nondeterministic processes, fully probabilistic processes, and fully Markovian processes without silent moves can be harmonized by means of a modal language comprising true, disjunction, and diamond...|$|R
