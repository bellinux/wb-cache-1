5|$|Article 7 of the Indiana Constitution {{governs the}} term length of Supreme Court Justices. When {{there is a}} vacancy on the Court, a new justice is {{nominated}} using {{a variation of the}} Missouri Plan. First, the Judicial Nominating Commission submits a list of three qualified nominees to the governor. The governor then selects the new Justice from the list. If the governor fails to choose a replacement within sixty days, the <b>chief</b> <b>justice</b> or the acting <b>chief</b> <b>justice</b> must do so. The Judicial Nomination Commission <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> selects the <b>chief</b> <b>justice</b> from the sitting associate justices for a five-year term. The <b>chief</b> <b>justice</b> presides over the Court. When the position of <b>chief</b> <b>justice</b> becomes vacant, the most senior member of the Court serves as the acting <b>chief</b> <b>justice</b> until a new one is chosen by the Judicial Nominating Commission. The <b>chief</b> <b>justice</b> also serves as chairman of the Judicial Nominating Commission.|$|E

5|$|As Associate Justices {{left the}} court in {{subsequent}} years, Washington appointed Thomas Johnson, William Paterson, and Samuel Chase. Jay stepped down as <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> in 1795 {{and was replaced by}} Rutledge, who received a recess appointment as <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice.</b> Rutledge served for six months but resigned after his nomination was rejected by the Senate in December 1795. After the rejection of Rutledge's nomination, Washington appointed Oliver Ellsworth as the third <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, Taft {{wanted to}} be <b>chief</b> <b>justice,</b> and kept {{a close eye on}} the health of the aging incumbent, Melville Fuller, who turned 75 in 1908. Taft {{believed}} Fuller likely to live many years. Roosevelt had indicated he was likely to appoint Taft if the opportunity came to fill the court's center seat, but some considered Attorney General Philander Knox a better candidate. In any event, Fuller remained <b>chief</b> <b>justice</b> throughout Roosevelt's presidency.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the duties 2 ̆ 6 activities of <b>Chief</b> <b>Justices</b> indicates that there is considerable variability in the approach of <b>Chief</b> <b>Justices</b> to such things as judicial administration, oversight, 2 ̆ 6 representation. Information was obtained from an informal survey of <b>Chief</b> <b>Justices</b> from 27 countries who were attending a June 2003 Conference of <b>Chief</b> <b>Justices</b> of Asia 2 ̆ 6 the Pacific. Special attention is given to three key aspects of global judicial education: information transmission, training, 2 ̆ 6 peer exchange. The survey responses indicated that <b>Chief</b> <b>Justices</b> encounter similar challenges 2 ̆ 6 share common purposes; however, there are substantial differences in {{the extent of their}} authority over lower court judges; the time they spend on court administration; the frequency with which they announce policy decisions; 2 ̆ 6 {{the degree to which they}} interact personally with the media. The importance of the information for the globalization of judicial education is discussed. It is concluded that global education programs benefit more from a peer-exchange approach than a training approach. Appendixes. J. Lindrot...|$|R

5|$|As {{the first}} President, Washington was {{responsible}} for appointing the entire Supreme Court; he appointed a record ten justices, including two Chief Justices who were confirmed from outside the Court and one former Justice named as <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> by a recess appointment, but not ultimately confirmed to the position. Additionally, Washington nominated Robert H. Harrison, who declined to serve, and nominated William Cushing for elevation to <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice,</b> who likewise declined.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{technical}} knowledge, {{the most important}} officers were the three Prothonotaries, {{the first and third}} of whom were appointed by the <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> and the second by the <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> on the advice of the Custos Brevium. They were responsible for enrolling records of litigation, including anything that raised a point of law, and were often consulted by the court due to their detailed technical knowledge. The <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> also appointed the Clerk of the Warrants, Clerk of the Treasury (also known as the Clerk of Hell), the Keeper of the Seal, the Clerk of Essoins and the Clerk of Acknowledgments of Fines and Recoveries (who was officially the Chief Justice's own clerk, rather than that of the court), as well as other officials. The Custos Brevium appointed the Clerk of the Juries, responsible for issuing writs of Habeas Corpus.|$|E

5|$|Hastings {{settled in}} Benicia, California. In September 1849, {{he served as}} Prosecuting Attorney for the newly {{established}} court in Alameda County. A few months later, California legislature selected {{him to be the}} first <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> of the California Supreme Court. He started his term on December 20, 1849, but the court did not assemble until March 4, 1850. In 1851, his family moved from Iowa to live with him in California. During his term as <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> he ran for the office of Attorney General of California. Elections were held on September 3, 1851, and he won with 52.2% of the votes. The Whig candidate, William D. Fair, received the rest of the votes. His term as <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> ended in December 1851, and he assumed office as Attorney General on January 5, 1852. While serving as Attorney General, he could practice law as well, something he could not do as <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice.</b> The wealth he earned during this time became the foundation of the larger fortune he would later earn in real estate. He ended his two-year term on January 2, 1854.|$|E
5|$|He was accepted, and {{although}} his appointment delighted Murray, {{the government was}} very concerned {{at the loss of}} a good Attorney General. In an attempt to persuade him to stay, the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Newcastle offered him the Duchy of Lancaster, in addition to the position of Attorney General, an extra £6,000 a year, and a pension, and finally attempted to blackmail him by saying that if he accepted the office of Lord <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice,</b> the government would refuse to grant him a peerage. It was customary for all Lord Chief Justices to be given a peerage, and Murray responded by saying that in that situation he would refuse to become either Lord <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> or Attorney General. Newcastle gave in, and promised to allow him to become Lord <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> and to recommend him for a peerage.|$|E

5|$|In January 1960 Heffron {{provided}} his {{old friend}} H. V. Evatt a dignified exit from federal politics by nominating him to succeed Sir Kenneth Street as <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> of New South Wales. His Attorney General Reg Downing, however, was horrified, having favoured the senior puisne justice Sir William Owen as the most suitable candidate while also realising that Evatt's worsening health would render him less than equal {{to the task of}} <b>chief</b> <b>justice.</b> Therefore, while Downing, as attorney general, would normally be the person to move the nomination of <b>chief</b> <b>justice</b> in cabinet, he refused to do so, leaving Heffron to do it himself. Heffron's motion to nominate Evatt was passed narrowly by 8 votes to 6. Downing's concerns would come to pass as Evatt indeed proved highly ineffective, often wracked by mental and physical ill-health, was reduced to having most of his judgements written or co-written for him, and resigning in 1962 after only two years as <b>chief</b> <b>justice.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late September 2010, the Supreme Court {{considered}} removing presidential immunity. In October, <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> Chaudry {{met with}} his colleagues to discuss troubling media rumours that Zardari's government was planning to fire them; Chaudry requested government assurance that the stories were unfounded. In early January 2011, Zardari signed the 19th Amendment, which lessened the likelihood of future clashes between the President and the judiciary by strengthening {{the power of the}} <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> in deciding judicial appointments.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November, he {{was sworn}} in as a Privy Counsellor.

He only served until 8 April, and {{there is no evidence of}} his performing anything more than the standard day-to-day duties. He became a cabinet minister in 1757, still serving as Lord <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice,</b> and stayed until 1765.|$|E
