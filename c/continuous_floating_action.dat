In these devices, the charge is not stored in a <b>continuous</b> <b>floating</b> gate but in a discontinuous layer composed by numerous discrete silicon quantum dots well separated one from the other. The nanocrystals of radius of few nanometers are realized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of silicon on the tunnel oxide of 2. 8 nm of thickness. These islands have been coated with a control oxide of 7 nm formed by CVD and incorporated in Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor structure. The devices are programmed and erased by tunnelling using low voltages and fast times. In addition, the programming can be easily achieved also by channel hot electron injection (CHEI). Furthermore, such nanocrystal memory cells have been extensively characterized in order to study the possibility to achieve dual bit operation. In fact, during channel hot electron programming, the charge can be selectively injected only at the drain-side of the cell. This remains there localized due {{to the presence of}} the SiO 2 between the grains which limits the lateral charge flow. The asymmetric charge distribution represents the key concept to the multi-bit storage. In this work, we show experimental evidence of such asymmetry. © 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Conventional Flash {{memory devices}} face a scaling issue that will impede memory scaling beyond the 50 nm node: a {{reliability}} issue involving the tunneling oxide thickness and charge retention. A possible {{solution is to}} replace the <b>continuous</b> <b>floating</b> gate, where charge is stored, with a segmented charge storage film, so that leakage through defects in the tunneling oxide would be localized. We first explored using quantum dots as possible floating gate replacements. After conducting simulations, we established {{the need for the}} smallest possible segmented structures. This led us to the use of molecular films as floating gates in non-volatile flash memories. As an example, a single organic molecule of 3, 4, 9, 10 -parylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) occupies lnm 2 in area and is capable of storing and retaining a single charge. If a defect is present in the tunneling oxide below the floating gate, only a few molecules of PTCDA would be affected due to poor lateral conduction between PTCDA molecules. We can, therefore, project that such molecular thin films of PTCDA are likely to meet demanding size and packing density requirements of advancing flash memory technology. by Hassen Abdu. Thesis (M.

After implementation, the model was tested successfully at a well-characterised site in the USA and subsequently applied at two sites in The Netherlands. Simulated results on the Bemidji site (USA) indicate that the emissions from the characterised oil lens and even from the residual zone remain virtually constant.

30|$|In recent years, nanocrystal-based {{memory devices}} have {{attracted}} considerable attention {{as a possible}} solution to overcome the scaling issue of electronic nonvolatile memories (NVMs) [URL] By using discrete nanocrystals instead of the conventional <b>continuous</b> <b>floating</b> gate as charge storage nodes, local-defect-related leakage can be reduced efficiently to improve data retention [1]. In this regard, discrete-trap type semiconductor storage materials such as Si and Ge nanocrystals (Si- and Ge-ncs) embedded in a dielectric matrix have been demonstrated as potential candidates for the fabrication of high-speed, high-density, low-power-consuming, and nonvolatile memories [2 – 6]. Several approaches have been reported for nanocrystal formation in a dielectric matrix, such as chemical vapor deposition, molecular beam epitaxy, or sputtering. The main attention was devoted to two major ones, namely deposition in vacuum and ion beam synthesis, since they are also used in the semiconductor industry for other purposes other than nanocrystal fabrication. Another approach for the fabrication of Si-ncs is the radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, as discussed previously [7 – 11]. The excess Si content in the layers {{can be obtained by}} several ways. One of them is the sputtering of two separated (pure Si and SiO 2) targets [7, 8, 12] or one composed (SiO 2 target topped by Si chips) target in pure argon plasma [7, 13, 14]. The other one is the reactive approach, which deals with the sputtering of pure SiO 2 target in mixed argon-hydrogen plasma [9 – 11] or pure Si target in argon-oxygen mixture [15]. The Si excess is controlled by varying the hydrogen [9 – 11] or oxygen flow rate [15] in the plasma. After subsequent high-temperature annealing, Si-ncs can be easily formed in these Si-rich SiO 2 (SRSO) composite layers [7 – 15].|$|R
40|$|A {{selection}} of problems are presented which study {{the interaction of}} hydroelastic waves with fixed structures. A thin floating elastic plate model is considered which primarily represents a <b>continuous</b> <b>floating</b> ice sheet, but may also be applied to very large floating platforms. The incident hydroelastic waves are assumed to either propagate from long–distance towards the structures or be generated by a moving load. All aspects of the subsequent interaction are studied in detail. The elastic plate is clamped to the fixed vertical structures to model an ice sheet frozen to the structure boundary. Both linear and nonlinear formulations are admitted for a {{selection of}} two– and three–dimensional problems. For the linear problems, selection of appropriate integral transforms leads to explicit analytical solutions in terms of integral quadratures. For the nonlinear case, the numerical solution is found by application of Green’s second identity combined with a boundary element method.

Particular attention is paid to the strain at the ice–structure boundary. The integral transforms also lead to concise expressions for the horizontal and vertical wave forces impacting on the structure.

Several assumptions are utilised which allow the problems to be mathematically treatable while retaining accuracy. Realistic effects such as viscoelasticity and fluid stratification are studied.

40|$|Introduction This {{graduation}} {{project has}} been initiated to research the technical feasibility of floating bridges. The {{project has been}} done in co-operation with the FDN engineering company and Delft technical university. A design is made of a <b>continuous</b> pontoon <b>floating</b> bridge, which connects a mainland to an island. Floating bridges can be constructed where conventional bridges are impractical (under the conditions that are described in section 1. 4. 2). The buoyancy forces support the bridge in the vertical direction and the mooring system in the horizontal direction. The project contains also a survey of the most known floating bridges in the world. Problem definition Which design limitations and structural parameters can ensure stability of the <b>continuous</b> pontoon <b>floating</b> bridge under wind and wave load? Research The objective of this thesis is to understand the response of the <b>continuous</b> pontoon <b>floating</b> bridges under wind-wave load and traffic load that is described in the euro code which enables us to optimize the structural design procedure. That can be accomplished by studying the influence of the pontoon dimensions and the pontoon connector rotational rigidity on the global stability of the bridge. Determination the principles of response reduction and converting the displacement into internal forces are a relevant part of this thesis as well as the mitigating of the local environmental loads to be redistributed along larger parts of the bridge. The scope of the graduation project is very wide. It contains an overview of floating bridges; its hydrodynamic behaviour will be defined and due to the limited period of time will be not analyzed. The hydrostatic behaviour and analysis of <b>continuous</b> pontoon <b>floating</b> bridges will be researched as a multi-body slender structure with flexible connections. Also the conceptual design of the pontoons and the connections and the shape effects were researched. Detailed design calculations for the case study are included in this thesis. Results Environmental loads are the main loading on the floating bridge. Because of the random form of the sea wave forces and the wind force, it is difficult to expect the precise value and direction of loading on the bridge. The environmental loads twist the bridge and excite it in the horizontal and in the vertical direction. When it is possible to construct a sliding pile mooring system to introduce the wind and wave load in the horizontal direction, the floating bridge will have a satisfactory stability. The efficiency of the mooring cable is lower than the sliding pile due to the relatively large compliance range. That is valid also for the vertical displacement; the bridge response will be introduced by the bridge flexural rigidity, the bridge mass, the water spring, the water damping and the pontoon connector stiffness when discrete pontoons are used. The linear theory is applied to determine the sea wave load. The hydro-static and the hydro-dynamic analysis of a multi-body slender structure consisting of rigidly or flexibly connected elements will be made [...] The design procedure of the mooring cables of the offshore structure is applied to design the mooring system. Conclusions and recommendations The connection stiffness of the pontoon has a large influence on the bridge response. The ratio connection stiffness over pontoon stiffness is very important for the bridge structural behaviour. When this ratio is smaller than 10 - 8 the bridge behaves as rigid bodies connected by hinges. When this ratio is larger than 10 - 3 the bridge behaves as a continuous elastic beam. The largest deflections, moments, and shear forces occur in the ends of the bridge. Additional supports, masses, or dampers at these ends can reduce these moments and forces strongly. Embedment steel crossheads are used to introduce the large mooring line forces without damaging the concrete walls of the pontoons. Further optimization of the pontoon length is recommended. Fatigue of the prestressing steel and the concrete are shown to be critical and need to be further investigated. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
