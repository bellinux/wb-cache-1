40|$|Purpose of the Study This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} if teacher education students in two {{institutions of higher education}} were more authoritarian or <b>closed</b> <b>minded</b> than students in other fields of study. In addition, the study was designed to explore the relationship of other variables [...] sex, religious affiliation, church attendance, and city size and state of child residency [...] to open-closed mindedness. Methods and Procedures Participating in this study were 1049 junior and senior students from Utah State University and 837 subjects from Weber State College. Subjects were primarily from a Latter-day Saint (Mormon) subculture. All subjects were administered the F Scale and Rokeach 2 ̆ 7 s D Scale as instruments for measuring authoritarianism and dogmatism, respectively. Two major hypotheses and 17 minor hypotheses concerning three general types of variables [...] personal characteristics, demographic background data, and educational characteristics [...] -were tested. Analysis of covariance, simple and factorial, was used to analyze the data. The analyses were computed by the general least squares solution, which permitted adjustment for unequal cell frequencies. Differences between pairs of means were tested for significance using linear comparisons. Findings and Conclusions Differences among the mean D and F Scale scores for the various academic areas were found to be significant. Students majoring in academic areas generally considered to be humanistically oriented tended to be significantly less authoritarian than those students in academic areas organized around skills or 2 ̆ 2 thingism 2 ̆ 2 (e. g., social science majors were less <b>closed</b> <b>minded</b> than engineering, business and math-science majors). In addition, in analyses using only students planning to receive secondary certificates, significant differences were found among the academic majors for both the D and F scales at USU, but not at WSC. When all students planning to teach [...] regardless of subject area [...] were categorized as one major [...] education [...] they were generally no more <b>closed</b> <b>minded</b> than any other major. Also, when prospective secondary education teachers were compared with their non-teaching counterparts in the same academic major, the differences were generally not significant. The study considered the relationship of certain variables to the D and F Scale scores. Sex was found {{to be related to the}} D and F Scale scores. Differences between males and females were significant (p 3 ̆c. OOl) at both institutions and for both scales. However, elementary or secondary males did not differ from their female counterparts at USU on either scale, although at WSC, male elementary and male secondary subjects were significantly more dogmatic than their female counterparts. City size and the state of residency in which subjects grew up, as well as church attendance, were significantly related to D and F Scale scores at USU. However, these factors were generally not significant for WSC subjects. In addition, church attendance and religious preference interactions were significant for the USU subjects. The results of this study suggest that education majors are not more <b>closed</b> <b>minded</b> than students in other college fields. In addition, the findings indicate that D and F Scale scores are not independent of such variables as sex, major, religion, church attendance, geographical location of childhood residency [...] city size and state [...] and even the institution of higher education attended, and these variables should be taken into account in research designs. The factorial analysis of covariance using a general least squares solution seems particularly appropriate because it also allows adjustments for unequal frequencies which frequently occur in sampling studies such as this one. Taking into account in research and statistical design the variables used in this study would help to eliminate inconsistent, uninterpretable findings and build a cumulative body of knowledge about the open-closed mindedness of teachers...|$|E

40|$|Most {{observers}} {{would agree}} that a healthy field of study needs diversity and a vibrant and open market for ideas. Thus, {{it would seem that}} calls for pluralism in economics, such as have been made by self-described heterodox economists, would be welcomed by the mainstream economics profession. They haven’t been; the calls have been essentially ignored by the mainstream, leading some heterodox economists to argue that the mainstream of economics is unpluralistic, closed-minded, and ideologically biased. In turn, heterodox calls for pluralism are seen by many in the mainstream as simply calls for the mainstream to listen to the heterodox economist’s particular point of view, and not as true calls for pluralism. Because it fails to achieve the desired ends, I find the rhetoric of pluralism unhelpful. Heterodox calls for pluralism do not increase openness or foster communication between heterodox and mainstream economists because such calls suggest that mainstream economists somehow do not favor openness to alternative views, and that the reason why mainstream economists are not open to heterodox ideas is because mainstream economists are <b>closed</b> <b>minded.</b> Seeing the mainstream’s rejection o...|$|E

Each of these participants was assessed in developmental or selection assessment centers. Each sample on average strongly endorsed realistic occupational interests (Holland, 1997) with different secondary and tertiary interests depending on which interest measure was used (Strong Vocational Interest Blank vs. the Vocational Interest Inventory). The results generally confirmed Lowman’s (1991, 1993) interdomain model in the samples’ ability and personality results. Compared with normative groups, the samples scored, on average, high on mechanical abilities, average in verbal and overall general intelligence, but in the high average range on nonverbal intelligence while scoring average in the assessment center exercises. On the personality measures, participants on average presented themselves as being masculine, inflexible, and <b>closed</b> <b>minded</b> on personality measures.

40|$|Models of {{continuous}} opinion dynamics under bounded confidence show a sharp transition between a consensus and a polarization phase {{at a critical}} global bound of confidence. In this paper, heterogeneous bounds of confidence for agents are studied. The surprising result is that a society of agents with two different bounds of confidence (open minded and <b>closed</b> <b>minded</b> agents) can find consensus even when both bounds of confidence are below the critical bound of confidence of a homogeneous society. The phenomenon is shown by numerical computation of the time evolution of the agents density in the opinion interval. We compute this for the two most popular bounded confidence models: the model of Deffuant, Weisbuch and others (DW), and the model of Hegselmann and Krause (HK). In the DW model agents meet in random pairwise encounters and each agent moves to the average of their opinions if the other’s opinion is closer than her bound of confidence to her own opinion. In the HK model each agent moves to the average opinion of all opinions in her area of confidence which is defined by her bound of confidence. The drawback of the better chances for consensus due to heterogeneity in the bounds of confidence is that the opinion dynamics gets suspect to severe drifts of clusters. This is demonstrated by examples...|$|E

40|$|There’s no {{question}} but {{that many people}} have <b>closed</b> <b>minds</b> regarding the claims of parapsychology. There’s also {{no question}} but {{that this is a}} sad and – when the <b>closed</b> <b>minds</b> belong to philosophers and scientists – a shameful fact. While a case might be made for the necessity of a certain degree of closed-mindedness for scientists (for if you treat everything as equally possible, your investigation is unlikely ever to get off the ground), there’s no such excuse for philosophers. The philosopher should be unrestricted by fashions in thought, including the unquestioning acceptance of whatever scientific theories are currently dominant. The fact is, however, that in this field and in the philosophy of mind, many if not most philosophers fall short of the philosophical ideal. Unfortunately, those who approach the field of parapsychology with any seriousness tend to reach a galling conclusion: an open mind reaches much the same conclusions as does a closed one. Not precisely the same conclusions; the central difference is that the open mind concludes that some of the subject matter of parapsychology – the phenomena discovered through experiment, semi-experiment, and anecdote 1 – genuinely stands in need of investigation and explanation; the <b>closed</b> <b>mind</b> tends to reject the whole boiling, thus throwing out the baby with the bath water. Of course, the open mind makes no commitment to the paranormal nature of the phenomena, only to their occurrence and to the need for explanation. So, if there really is something for parapsychologists to do, what’s wrong with the way that they do it? In an article of this length, I have a limited number of options: I could gesture in a journalistic way at all the grounds for my criticisms of parapsychology; I could do the same sort of thing, but try to be more balanced; I could choose a few issues and deal with them more fully.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Taber and Lodge’s 2006 paper {{provides}} powerful {{evidence that}} one’s prior beliefs shape one’s reception of new {{evidence in a}} manner that can best be described as ‘‘inadvertently dogmatic. ’ ’ This is especially true for people who are well informed, which dovetails with findings going back to Converse (1964) showing political beliefs to be ideologically constrained (rigid) among the relatively well informed. What may explain the coincidence of dogmatism and knowledge-ability is the very process of learning about politics, which must use theories, schemas, ideologies, or Lippmannesque ‘‘stereotypes’ ’ to target certain political information as germane by putting it into an interpretive framework. This interpretive process is likely to create for each of us a growing database of information that is congruent with our extant convictions but that excludes incongruent information: in light of the data we have already processed, incongruent information seems increasingly implausible (if not incomprehensible), and is therefore rationally ignored or dismissed. But this does not necessarily mean, as Taber and Lodge follow Robert Abelson in suggesting, that people are ‘‘motivated’ ’ to be dogmatic rather than being unintentionally <b>closed</b> <b>minded</b> {{as a result of the}} plausibility they involuntarily accord to their priors. Recognizing the inadvertent (unmotivated) nature of dogmatism is essential if political science is to take seriously political actors’ beliefs*and to assess the gravity of the problem posed by dogmatism...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesSouth Africa {{has seen}} many {{developments}} {{in both the}} areas of corporate law and tax legislation. The legislation in question has developed from an apartheid or pre-democratic era {{to that of the}} current democratic South Africa, in which individuals have the freedom to become entrepreneurs, and have the opportunity to start up small to medium and larger enterprises, in order to firstly make a profit but also to ensure that they enjoy the benefits which the separate legal personality of Corporate Structures are entitled to. The focus of the research was to carefully study Corporate Structures created by directors and other entities and to show how these personalities make use of various arrangements to reduce tax liability, both by lawful and unlawful methods. In addition to this, the research involved a close analysis a of how a Corporate Structure is formed, from the date of incorporation of the entity, to the rights, and duties of the entity, the rights and duties of the role-players such as directors and shareholders, who control the entity and make the necessary decisions relating to the entity. The thesis focuses on the tests used by the courts to examine the true commercial substance of Corporate Structures and the arrangements put in place by these entities or individuals mentioned above. The above approach was applied by analysing the principle of Piercing the Corporate Veil both at common law and statutory level, the principles of Substance over Form, General Anti-Avoidance provisions and the Tax Administration Act 28 of 2011 provisions, in light of the Anti-Avoidance provisions. It is trite law that taxpayers are allowed to arrange their affairs or commercial activities in a manner in which they may gain a tax advantage provided they do so, within the ambit of the law. The effect of the taxpayer having such freedoms {{is that many of the}} contracting parties or taxpayers abuse the legislative provisions and enter into transactions and commercial activities which circumvent the legal provisions. The framework of the analysis was to look at the Companies Act 71 of 2008, Income Tax 58 of 1962 and the Tax Administration Act 28 of 2011 Acts respectively. The result of the research has shown that the tests put forward by the courts assist in ensuring that the principle of separate legal personality is upheld, taxpayers such as entities are free to arrange their affairs in a manner that allows a certain tax advantage provided it is within the ambit of the law. The study has shown that the doctrine of separate legal personality is upheld within our current legal system. There are many tax and legal benefits to natural persons establishing an entity; however these benefits should not lead to abuse by entities. Lastly, the courts will carefully scrutinise the commercial substance of a transaction and test whether the parties to the transaction have acted in accordance with the true principles of the transactions, the conclusion herein is therefore that the law should not interpret the modern commercial world with a <b>closed</b> <b>minded</b> approach and legislate strictly, without considering all the circumstances of a matter in light of the necessary law and policy considerations and in so doing, rather adopt a modern commercial minded approach. As a growing South African economy, entities should be permitted to arrange their commercial transactions and affairs in the best possible way to obtain a legal tax benefit and make profits which will ultimately ensure that we have a sustainable economy and strong Corporate Structures in place, in order to be placed in a stronger position in terms of an African perspective and compete more competitively at an International level...|$|E
