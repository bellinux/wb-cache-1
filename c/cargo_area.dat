5|$|Miri Port Authority (MPA) was {{established}} on 1 February 1981 and commenced operation on 1 March 1983. It is {{located near the}} mouth of Baram River. The port is able to take in ships measuring up to 1,500 GRT (Gross Register Tonnage), with general <b>cargo</b> <b>area</b> of 50,895 m2 and total developed area of 34 hectares (0.34km2). It is mainly used in handling petroleum, timber products, coal, and building materials. A total of 23.94 million metric tonnes of goods was handled by MPA from 2011 to 2013, which earned a total revenue of RM 48.58 million in port dues.|$|E
5|$|The combi model, the 747-200M, {{could carry}} freight {{in the rear}} section of the main deck via a side cargo door. A {{removable}} partition on the main deck separated the <b>cargo</b> <b>area</b> at the rear from the passengers at the front. The -200M could carry up to 238 passengers in a three-class configuration with cargo carried on the main deck. The model was {{also known as the}} 747-200 Combi. As on the -100, a stretched upper deck (SUD) modification was later offered. A total of 10 converted 747-200s were operated by KLM. Union des Transports Aériens (UTA) also had two aircraft converted.|$|E
25|$|The airport {{incorporates}} two <b>cargo</b> <b>areas,</b> North <b>Cargo</b> and South Cargo. The North <b>Cargo</b> terminal <b>area</b> {{is used by}} cargo airlines.

The public <b>cargo</b> working <b>area</b> was fully decommissioned in December 2011. The promenade was subsequently extended by 750 metres to the north, to a total length of about one kilometre. This second stage opened on 27 May 2015.|$|R

25|$|Toronto Pearson {{processes}} over 45% {{of total}} air cargo in Canada. There are three primary cargo facilities at the airport, known as The Cargo West Facilities, the VISTA <b>Cargo</b> <b>area,</b> and the FedEx <b>cargo</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
25|$|The VISTA <b>cargo</b> <b>area</b> (also {{known as}} Cargo East) is a privately owned and {{operated}} complex that is located north of Terminal 3. The VISTA <b>cargo</b> <b>area</b> consists of a multi-tenant facility organized in a U-shape with an adjacent cargo apron area. The FedEx <b>Cargo</b> <b>area</b> (also known as Cargo North) is the Canadian hub for FedEx Express. The site occupies an area {{on the north side}} of the airport lands near runway 05/23, and is home to two cargo buildings along with dedicated ramp space.|$|E

50|$|The {{second part}} of the Marpol Annex I {{has more to do with}} {{cleaning}} the <b>cargo</b> <b>areas</b> and tanks. Oil Discharge Monitoring Equipment (ODME) is a technology that has greatly helped improve efficiency and environmental protection in these areas.|$|R
25|$|Two {{satellite}} cargo {{areas have}} warehouse and build-up/tear down facilities, but aircraft do not park at these. Freight is trucked to/from aircraft on other ramps. The South <b>Cargo</b> <b>Area</b> is along Mannheim Road. The East <b>Cargo</b> <b>Area,</b> adjacent to Terminal 5, was formerly the airport's only cargo section but has now mostly evolved into an airport support zone.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} cargo areas at O'Hare that have warehouse, build-up/tear-down and {{aircraft}} parking facilities. The Southwest <b>Cargo</b> <b>Area,</b> adjacent to Irving Park Road, accommodates over 80% of the airport's all-cargo flights, divided among 9 buildings in two tiers. The North <b>Cargo</b> <b>Area,</b> which is a modest conversion of the former military base (the 1943 Douglas plant area), also receives air freighters. It is adjacent to the northern portion of Bessie Coleman Drive.|$|E
50|$|The Port Authority {{provides}} free {{shuttle bus}} service between the Federal Circle AirTrain station and the airport's <b>cargo</b> <b>areas,</b> as well as within the long term and Port Authority-operated employee parking lots. These buses are operated by Servisair under contract.|$|R

50|$|Before {{separating}} {{for their}} final destinations, the Howard Beach and Jamaica routes stop at Federal Circle for car rental companies and shuttle buses to hotels and the airport's <b>cargo</b> <b>areas.</b> Both routes make a counterclockwise loop through {{the airport and}} stop at each terminal.|$|R

25|$|The Southwest <b>Cargo</b> <b>Area</b> {{partially}} lies in {{the path}} of one of the new runways (10C/28C). The redevelopment of the airfield will entail moving/replacing this primary cargo hub.|$|E
25|$|The {{landing gear}} is of {{conventional}} configuration, with bungee suspension, giving good rough field capabilities. The enclosed cabin includes a <b>cargo</b> <b>area</b> that {{is located on}} the aircraft's center of gravity, eliminating trim changes as the load varies.|$|E

25|$|The Norwegian State Railways {{bought the}} farm Nordre Alna in 1918, {{allowing}} for a further development of the station and <b>cargo</b> <b>areas.</b> The line past the station was electrified on 1 September 1927. The Loenga–Alnabru Line followed on 15 October 1928. A complete interlocking system became operational from 28 August 1938.|$|R
50|$|Ferries operate between Port of Spain and Scarborough. Cars can {{be brought}} onto the ferries and kept in the <b>cargo</b> <b>areas.</b> Ferries run daily, Sundays to Sunday (less sailings on the weekend). The ferries are inexpensive, {{in spite of the}} minimum 2½-3 hour travel time between Port of Spain and Scarborough.|$|R
25|$|The {{airport is}} served by several Fixed-Base Operators (FBO), which handle fueling, ground handling, {{aircraft}} cleaning, cargo service and aircraft maintenance. They include Swissport USA and Ground Service International. General aviation, which is adjacent to the North <b>Cargo</b> <b>area,</b> is handled by Signature Flight Support.|$|E
25|$|The Cargo West Facilities (also {{known as}} the Infield <b>Cargo</b> <b>Area)</b> are located between runways 15L/33R and 15R/33L.

25|$|A large {{air cargo}} complex on the {{southwest}} {{side of the field}} opened in 1984, replacing most of the old <b>cargo</b> <b>area,</b> which stood on the site now occupied by e Terminal 5.

25|$|As {{part of a}} {{strategic}} development plan, €561 million have been spent on expanding and modernising the airport infrastructure until December 2012. Most of these improvements are already completed, the postponed ones are the new <b>cargo</b> <b>area</b> and new piers for terminal 2A and 2B, but these development are on standby also, and will start immediately, when the airport traffic will reach the appropriate level.|$|E
25|$|This plan is used {{early in}} the morning for departing {{aircraft}}. Departing aircraft that are located at the West <b>Cargo</b> <b>area</b> will be held there until a gate operated by their airline opens. Once there is an open gate, the plane will be towed into the gate by a tug. Usually these operations take place for evening flights from 9PM to about midnight. For morning flights, it is usually around 6 am and will end around 8 am.|$|E

50|$|As {{its name}} implies, the basin was {{formerly}} {{used as a}} public <b>cargo</b> handling <b>area.</b> Mid-stream operators transferred goods from ocean-going ships onto barges. They then sailed to the Wan Chai Cargo Handling Basin, where they transferred the goods onto trucks. In 2003, the basin's cargo-handling activities were relocated to the Chai Wan Public <b>Cargo</b> Working <b>Area.</b>|$|R
