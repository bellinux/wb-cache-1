Although there is increasing awareness among heritage organizations about the importance of maintenance, these organizations lack a systematic and integrated approach to maintenance that centres on the idea of explicitly using the identification of cultural significance and vulnerability as the key reference point for management decisions and actions. While many of the non-heritage organizations had adopted aspects of a best-practice approach to general maintenance management, these had not been recontextualized for the needs of the listed stock. There is a need for a step change to ensure that the retention of cultural significance and minimal intervention set the context for maintenance management strategies and implementation.

40|$|A key {{challenge}} for humanity {{is how a}} future global population of 9 billion can all be fed healthily and sustainably. Here, we review how competition for land is influenced by other drivers and pressures, examine land-use change over the past 20 years and consider future changes over the next 40 years. Competition for land, in itself, is not a driver affecting food and farming in the future, but is an emergent property of other drivers and pressures. Modelling studies suggest that future policy decisions in the agriculture, forestry, energy and <b>conservation</b> <b>sectors</b> could have profound effects, with diferent demands for land to supply multiple ecosystem services usually intensifying competition for land in the future. In addition to policies addressing agriculture and food production, further policies addressing the pimary drivers of competition for land (population growth, dietary preference, protected areas, forest policy) could have significant impacts in reducing competition for land. Technologies for increasing per-area productivity of agricultural land will also be necessary. Key uncertainties in our projections of competition for land in the future relate predominantly to uncertainties in the drivers and pressures within the scenarios, in the models and data used in the projections and in the policy intervetions assumed to affect the drivers and pressures in the future...|$|R

40|$|In South Africa, {{following}} {{decades of}} apartheid, which included racially-based land dispossessions, the post-apartheid government has implemented a land reform pro-gramme, which {{allows people to}} re-claim the land they were forcefully removed from. Many of these land claims are targeting conservation areas, and this {{has resulted in the}} conservation and land reform sectors often coming into conflict. The paper analyzes current experiences in South Africa with regard to land reform in conservation areas, and, through the use of case studies, explores synergies and tensions, which currently exist between these two seemingly disparate objectives. The paper concludes that South Africa has achieved minimal success in reconciling these objectives. First, the divergent goals of the land and <b>conservation</b> <b>sectors</b> result in conflicts, which often lead to delays in the pro-cess of resolving land issues. Second, the joint management model used in South Africa to resolve land claims in protected areas appears unsuitable given current power imbalances between conservation agencies and poor rural people. Third, with the retention of the conservation status of land in all cases, land and resource rights remain unclear. Stronger and more secure land rights for the local people are therefore needed. Also needed are flexible strategies for resolving this dilemma, which may include alternative land uses other than ecotourism, and broader bioregional strategies for conservation that look beyond protected areas in terms of planning, conservation and economic development...|$|R

40|$|Internationally South Africa is {{regarded}} as a leading developing country in the application of SEA. Research also indicates that the <b>conservation</b> <b>sector</b> within South Africa has been particularly prominent in exploring its application.

To address this gap in knowledge the paper explores the input quality and output effectiveness of the greater Addo Elephant National Park SEA. The results show that the SEA achieved average to good input quality and output effectiveness performance, respectively. A number of lessons were learned for the application of SEA to future park expansion initiatives. These relate to the timing of the SEA, addressing social impacts, setting of boundaries as well as dealing with scale. The research results concluded that SEA made valuable contributions to decision making and could be considered an important decision-aiding tool for the <b>conservation</b> <b>sector.</b> To take the debate forward and to benchmark best practice it is proposed that further comparative performance evaluation research of multiple SEA case studies within the <b>conservation</b> <b>sector</b> be conducted...|$|E

Prompted by the recent development of a global strategy for the control and elimination of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), this paper seeks insight into the consequences of, and rational options for potential FMD control measures in relation to environmental, conservation and human poverty considerations in Africa. We suggest a more environmentally nuanced process of FMD control that safe-guards the integrity of wild populations and the ecosystem dynamics on which human livelihoods depend while simultaneously improving socio-economic conditions of rural people. In particular, we outline five major issues that need to be considered: 1) improved understanding of the different FMD viral strains and how they circulate between domestic and wildlife populations; 2) an appreciation for the economic value of wildlife for many African countries whose presence might preclude the country from ever achieving an FMD-free status; 3) exploring ways in which livestock production can be improved without compromising wildlife such as implementing commodity-based trading schemes; 4) introducing a participatory approach involving local farmers and the national veterinary services in the control of FMD; and 5) finally the possibility that transfrontier conservation might offer new hope of integrating decision-making at the wildlife-livestock interface.

Our study identified a number of direct and indirect barriers that affected the capacity of projects to carry out informative evaluations and generate knowledge on conservation progress in Samoa. These attributes and mechanisms include: the availability and management of data, design and planning of projects, and systems for reporting among donors and proponents.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{sustainability}} {{it is necessary to}} balance the interactions between the built and natural environment. Biodiversity plays an important part towards sustainability within the built environment, especially as the construction industry comes under increasing pressure to take ecological concerns into account. Bats constitute an important component of urban biodiversity and several species are now highly dependent on buildings, making them particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic and environmental changes. As many buildings suitable for use as bat roosts age, they often require re-roofing and traditional bituminous roofing felts are frequently being replaced with breathable roofing membranes (BRMs), which are designed to reduce condensation. Whilst the current position of bats is better in many respects than 30 years ago, new building regulations and modern materials, may substantially reduce the viability of existing roosts. At the same time building regulations require that materials be fit for purpose and with anecdotal evidence that both bats and BRMs may experience problems when the two interact, {{it is important to know}} what roost characteristics are essential for house dwelling bats and how these and BRMs may be affected. This paper reviews current literature and knowledge and considers the possible ways in which bats and BRMs may interact, how this could affect existing bat roosts within buildings and the implications for BRM service life predictions and warranties. It concludes that in order for the construction and <b>conservation</b> <b>sectors</b> to work together in solving this issue, a set of clear guidelines should be developed for use on a national level. ...|$|R
