40|$|Dailyatia is {{an enigmatic}} tommotiid genus endemic to lower Cambrian {{successions}} of East Gondwana (Australia and Antarctica). The plethora of sclerite mor photype variation {{has made the}} taxonomy of the genus highly problematic. Recovery of 6750 Dailyatia sclerites from more than 20 separate measured stratigraphic sections and 100 + spot localities from the Flinders Ranges (Arrowie Basin) of South Australia reveals hither to unappreciated species-level diversity. Superbly preserved new material provides intriguing new morphological and ultrastructural data [...] including the presence of bizzare honeycomb-like apicies and a possible partial scleritome fragment. An elongate, tapering tube attached to the inner surface of a few, rare sclerites appears to match sclerite growth but extends well beyond {{the margin of the}} sclerite. This possible pathological response to parasitism or internal shell damage reveals important new information about sclerite growth and functional morphology. Detailed investigation indicates that all 5 species of Dailyatia have discreet, and in some cases, mutually exclusive stratigraphic ranges [...] potentially important for regional biostratigraphic subdivision of Hawker Group rocks in the Arrowie Basin. The new palaeobiological and biostratigraphic information about Dailyatia (and other camenellans) will help decipher the complex timing of <b>character</b> <b>assembly</b> and morphological transformations from a deep root within the lophotrochozoan phylogenetic tree. 1 page(s...|$|E

Our focus in this paper {{is the development of}} methodological framework for generating all possible product configurations based on number of stable and optional components or modules from which a final product is completed. Subsequently, we propose an approach to determining so called product configuration complexity by specifying classes and sub-classes of product configurations. Then, for each sub-class of product configuration we can obtain upper bounds values of configuration complexity. Finally, configuration complexity scale based on the obtain upper bounds values is outlined and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Typographic {{characters}} are carefully designed shapes incorporating typedesign tradition, 1 the rules related to visual appearance, {{and the design}} ideas of a skilled character designer. 2 The typographic design process is structured and systematic: letterforms are visually related in weight, contrast, space, alignment, and style. To create a new typeface family, type designers generally start by designing a few key characters—such as o, h, p, and v— incorporating the most important structure elements such as vertical stems, round parts, diagonal bars, arches, and serifs (see Figure 1). They can then use the design features embedded into these structure elements (stem width, behavior of curved parts, contrast between thick and thin shape parts, and so on) to design the font’s remaining characters. 3 Today’s industrial font description standards such as Adobe Type 1 or TrueType represent typographic characters by their shape outlines, because of the simplicity of digitizing the contours of well-designed, large-size master characters. 4 We propose a new, highly flexible font description method that explicitly describes <b>characters</b> as <b>assemblies</b> of parameterizable shape components. By varying global parameters, we can derive fonts that vary in weight, condensation, and shape. However, outline characters only implicitly incorporate the designer’s...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of next-generation sequencing technologies has revolutionized the genome research and {{given rise to}} the explosive increase of DNA sequencing throughput. However, due to the continuing explosive growth of short-read database, these technologies face the challenges of short overlap and high throughput.

40|$|The {{precursor}} {{and mature}} 16 S ribosomal RNAs from a novel thermosensitive ribosomal assembly defective mutant of E. coli, in which genetic {{evidence suggests that}} the ribosomal protein S 4 is altered, have been isolated and characterised by finger-printing methods. The precursor 16 S RNA, which is accumulated at 42 °, appears to be identical with that present in wild-type strains, and with that previously described by other workers. However, the mature 16 S RNA, which is contained in apparently normal functional 30 S ribosomal particles synthesised at the growth-permissive temperature of 30 °, is incompletely trimmed and has either one or two additional nucleotides at its 5 ′-terminus. This might be due either to an accumulation of two late intermediates in the maturation process, or to mis-trimming of the RNA. Both possibilities suggest that the change in the protein S 4 is not only responsible for the thermosensitive <b>character</b> of ribosomal <b>assembly</b> in this mutant, but also causes an alteration in the trimming site, affecting its recognition by the enzyme involved in the maturation...|$|R
5000|$|The {{democratic}} <b>character</b> of the <b>assembly</b> at Basel was {{a result}} of both its composition and its organization. Doctors of theology, masters and representatives of chapters, monks and clerks of inferior orders constantly outnumbered the prelates in it, and the influence of the superior clergy had less weight because instead of being separated into [...] "nations", as at Constance, the fathers divided themselves according to their tastes or aptitudes into four large committees or [...] "deputations" [...] (deputationes). One was concerned with questions of faith (fidei), another with negotiations for peace (pacis), the third with reform (reformatorii), and the fourth with what they called [...] "common concerns" [...] (pro communibus). Every decision made by three [...] "deputations" [...] (the lower clergy formed the majority in each) received ratification for the sake of form in general congregation and, if necessary led to decrees promulgated in session. Papal critics thus termed the council [...] "an assembly of copyists" [...] or even [...] "a set of grooms and scullions".

40|$|Diffusion is a {{phenomenon}} of very widespread importance in molecular biophysics. Diffusion can determine the rates and <b>character</b> of the <b>assembly</b> of multisubunit structures, the binding of ligands to receptors, and the internal motions of molecules and assemblies that involve solvent surface displacements. Current computer simulation techniques provide much more detailed descriptions of diffusional processes than have been available in the past. Models can be constructed to include such realistic features as structural subunits at the submolecular level (domains, monomers, or atoms); detailed electrostatic charge distributions and corresponding solvent-screened inter- and intramolecular interactions; and hydrodynamic interactions. The trajectories can be analyzed either to provide direct information on biomolecular function (e. g., the bimolecular rate constant for formation of an electron-transfer complex between two proteins), or to provide or test models for the interpretation of experimental data (e. g., the time dependence of fluorescence depolarization for segments of DNA). Here, we first review the theory of diffusional simulations, with special emphasis on new techniques such as those for obtaining transport properties of flexible assemblies and rate constants of diffusion-controlled reactions. Then we survey a variety of recent applications, including studies of large-scale motion in DNA segments and substrate "steering" in enzyme-substrate binding. We conclude {{with a discussion of}} current work (e. g., formation of protein complexes) and possible areas for future work...|$|R
40|$|Icosahedral viruses exhibit elegant {{pathways}} of capsid {{assembly and}} maturation regulated by symmetry principles. Assembly {{is a dynamic}} process driven by consecutive and genetically programmed morphogenetic interactions between protein subunits. The non-symmetric capsid subunits are gathered by hydrophobic contacts and non-covalent interactions in assembly intermediates, which serve as blocks to build a symmetric capsid. In some cases, non-symmetric interactions among intermediates are involved in assembly, highlighting the remarkable capacity of capsid proteins to fold into demanding conformations compatible with a closed protein shell. In this chapter, the morphogenesis of structurally simple icosahedral viruses, including representative members of the parvoviruses, picornaviruses or polyomaviruses as paradigms, is described in some detail. Icosahedral virus assembly may occur in different subcellular compartments and involve a panoplia of cellular and viral factors, chaperones, and protein modifications that, in general, are still poorly characterized. Mechanisms of viral genome encapsidation may imply direct interactions between the genome and the assembly intermediates, or active packaging into a preformed empty capsid. High stability of intermediates and proteolytic cleavages during viral maturation usually contribute to the overall irreversible <b>character</b> of the <b>assembly</b> process. These and other simple icosahedral viruses were pioneer models to understand basic principles of virus assembly, continue to be leading subjects of morphogenetic analyses, and have inspired ongoing studies on the assembly of larger viruses and cellular and synthetic macromolecular complexes.

The motives of our opposition are found in those very sentiments which we are supposed to violate.

We know and feel that arbitrary power over distant regions is not within the competence, nor to be exercised agreeably to the forms or consistently with the spirit, of great popular assemblies.

40|$|Supramolecular {{assemblies}} of glycoconjugated dyes can {{be tailored}} with properties {{that make them}} attractive for use in biomedical applications. For example, when assemblies of glycoconjugated dyes are displaying carbohydrates on their periphery in a polyvalent manner, these assemblies {{can be used to}} study and visualize biological recognition events. Carbohydrates can selectively target cell membrane receptors and the polyvalency of the carbohydrate display on the supramolecular assemblies can strengthen the interaction with cells. In addition, some dyes assemble into fluorescent objects and some dyes can generate singlet oxygen. A combination of these properties results in a type of assemblies that {{can be used as a}} diagnostic and therapeutic tool. Fluorescence allows an easy, non-invasive read-out and is especially interesting for the detection and visualization of diseased cells or organs. Although singlet oxygen can be a reason for oxidative stress in healthy cells, it is also able to kill pathogens with low side effects and no resistance development. In this thesis two different molecular systems have been developed and the photophysical properties of their assemblies, also in the context of possible use, have been studied. As a first system glycoconjugated porphyrins have been synthesized. The type and number of carbohydrates on the periphery of the porphyrins have been varied and their influence on the photophysical properties and the size of the assemblies has been investigated. Studies concerning their bactericidal nature have been performed. The second system consisted of thiophthalonitriles whose assemblies showed excellent fluorescent properties. Also in this case the photophysical <b>character</b> of the <b>assemblies</b> has been documented and the most remarkable result has been that the hetero atom in the dye is decisive for the observation of the aggregation-induced emission. The thiophthalonitrile assemblies featuring mannose moieties underwent specific and reversible interactions with protein binding partners and bacteria. Since the peripheral substitution had no influence on the photophysical properties, its binding to other biological receptors can be easily realized, independent from the characteristics of the dye. This opens up numerous possibilities to apply these fluorescent nanoparticles in diagnostic research...|$|R
