5|$|In concert bands, {{clarinets}} are {{an important}} part of the instrumentation. The E <b>clarinet,</b> B <b>clarinet,</b> alto <b>clarinet,</b> bass <b>clarinet,</b> and contra-alto/contrabass <b>clarinet</b> are commonly used in concert bands. Concert bands generally have multiple B clarinets; there are commonly 3 B <b>clarinet</b> parts with 2–3 players per part. There is generally only one player per part on the other clarinets. There are not always E <b>clarinet,</b> alto <b>clarinet,</b> and contra-alto clarinets/contrabass <b>clarinet</b> parts in concert band music, but all three are quite common.|$|E

5|$|The {{orchestra}} frequently {{includes two}} clarinetists playing individual parts—each player is usually {{equipped with a}} pair of standard clarinets in B and A, and <b>clarinet</b> parts commonly alternate between B and A instruments several times {{over the course of a}} piece, or less commonly, a movement (e.g., 1st movement Brahms' 3rd symphony). <b>Clarinet</b> sections grew larger during the last few decades of the 19th century, often employing a third clarinetist, an E or a bass <b>clarinet.</b> In the 20th century, composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, and Olivier Messiaen enlarged the <b>clarinet</b> section on occasion to up to nine players, employing many different clarinets including the E or D soprano clarinets, basset horn, alto <b>clarinet,</b> bass <b>clarinet,</b> and/or contrabass <b>clarinet.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Clarinet</b> choir, which {{features}} {{a large number of}} clarinets playing together, usually involves a range of different members of the <b>clarinet</b> family (see Extended family of clarinets). The homogeneity of tone across the different members of the <b>clarinet</b> family produces an effect with some similarities to a human choir.|$|E
5|$|Clarinets {{have the}} largest pitch range of common woodwinds. The {{intricate}} key organization that makes this possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range {{is defined by the}} keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B <b>clarinet.</b> The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument in question. The nominal highest note of the B <b>clarinet</b> is a semitone higher than the highest note of the oboe. Since the <b>clarinet</b> has a wider range of notes, the lowest note of the B <b>clarinet</b> is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest note of the oboe.|$|E
5|$|In old-town {{folk music}} in the Republic of Macedonia (called čalgija ("чалгија")), the <b>clarinet</b> has the most {{important}} role in wedding music; <b>clarinet</b> solos mark {{the high point of}} dancing euphoria.

5|$|Nearly all soprano and piccolo {{clarinets}} have keywork {{enabling them}} to play the E below middle C as their lowest written note (in scientific pitch notation that sounds D3 on a soprano <b>clarinet</b> or C4, i.e. concert middle C, on a piccolo <b>clarinet),</b> though some B clarinets go down to E3 {{to enable them to}} match the range of the A <b>clarinet.</b> On the B soprano <b>clarinet,</b> the concert pitch of the lowest note is D3, a whole tone lower than the written pitch.|$|E

5|$|The <b>clarinet</b> is {{prominent}} in Bulgarian wedding music also; {{it is an}} offshoot of Roma/Romani traditional music. Ivo Papazov is a well-known clarinetist in this genre. In Moravian dulcimer bands, the <b>clarinet</b> is usually the only wind instrument among string instruments.|$|E
5|$|The <b>clarinet</b> {{is widely}} used as a solo instrument. The {{relatively}} late evolution of the <b>clarinet</b> (when compared to other orchestral woodwinds) has left solo repertoire from the Classical period and later, but few works from the Baroque era. Many <b>clarinet</b> concertos have been written to showcase the instrument, with the concerti by Mozart, Copland, and Weber being well known.|$|E
5|$|The clarinet's {{place in}} the jazz {{ensemble}} was usurped by the saxophone, which projects a more powerful sound and uses a less complicated fingering system. The requirement for an increased speed of execution in modern jazz also did not favour the <b>clarinet,</b> but the <b>clarinet</b> did not entirely disappear. A few players such as Buddy DeFranco, Tony Scott, and Jimmy Giuffre emerged during the 1950s playing bebop or other styles. A little later, Eric Dolphy (on bass <b>clarinet),</b> Perry Robinson, John Carter, Theo Jörgensmann, and others used the <b>clarinet</b> in free jazz. The French composer and clarinetist Jean-Christian Michel initiated a jazz-classical cross-over on the <b>clarinet</b> with the drummer Kenny Clarke.|$|E

5|$|While {{technical}} {{improvements and}} an equal-tempered scale reduced {{the need for}} two clarinets, the technical difficulty of playing in remote keys persisted, and the A has thus remained a standard orchestral instrument. In addition, by the late 19th century, the orchestral <b>clarinet</b> repertoire contained so much music for <b>clarinet</b> in A that the disuse of this instrument was not practical. Attempts were made to standardise to the B instrument between 1930 and 1950 (e.g., tutors recommended learning routine transposition of orchestral A parts on the B <b>clarinet,</b> including solos written for A <b>clarinet,</b> and some manufacturers provided a low E on the B to match {{the range of the}} A), but this failed in the orchestral sphere.|$|E
5|$|Around 1900, Dr. Richard H. Stein, a Berlin musicologist, made a quarter-tone <b>clarinet,</b> {{which was}} soon abandoned. Years later, another German, Fritz Schüller of Markneukirchen, built a quarter tone <b>clarinet,</b> with two {{parallel}} bores of slightly different lengths whose tone holes are operated {{using the same}} keywork and a valve to switch from one bore to the other.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} six, Flanagan's parents {{gave him}} a <b>clarinet</b> for Christmas. He learned to read music from playing the <b>clarinet,</b> but {{within a few years}} he {{preferred}} the piano. The family had a piano in the house, and Flanagan received lessons from one of his brothers, Johnson, and Gladys Wade Dillard, who also taught Kirk Lightsey and Barry Harris. Flanagan graduated from Northern High School, which he attended with other future musicians, including Sonny Red.|$|E
5000|$|Until the 1980s, only {{professional}} level <b>clarinets</b> carried the Buffet name.

By the early 1970s, Buffet {{was making the}} Evettes in their own factory in Paris, and around 1979, manufacture was moved to a Buffet-owned factory in Germany. Evette & Schaeffer <b>clarinets</b> were made in Paris.
