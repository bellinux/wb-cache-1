5|$|The British {{information}} gathering vessel St Georges, {{which holds}} the Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC), the system {{used by the}} Ministry of Defence to communicate with and co-ordinate the Royal Navy's fleet of Polaris submarines, is sunk after accidentally trawling an old naval mine in the Ionian Sea. MI6 agent James Bond is ordered by the Minister of Defence, Sir Frederick Gray and MI6 Chief of Staff, Bill Tanner, to retrieve the ATAC before the Soviets, as the transmitter <b>could</b> <b>order</b> attacks by the submarines' Polaris ballistic missiles.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the occupation troops directly commanded by Schröder, in June the Wehrmacht deployed {{the headquarters of the}} LXV Corps zbV to Belgrade to command four poorly-equipped occupation divisions, under the control of General der Artillerie Paul Bader. Three divisions were deployed in the occupied territory, and the fourth was deployed in the adjacent parts of the NDH. The three divisions had been transported to the occupied territory between 7 and 24 May, and were initially tasked with guarding the key railway lines to Bulgaria and Greece. By late June, Bader's headquarters had been established in Belgrade, and the three divisions in the occupied territory were deployed with headquarters at Valjevo in the west, Topola roughly in the centre of the territory, and Niš in the south. The status of Bader's command was that Schröder <b>could</b> <b>order</b> him to undertake operations against rebels, but he could not otherwise act as Bader's superior.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, Air Kruise {{moved to}} Lydd (Ferryfield) and Lympne was re-licensed in 1955. On 30 September 1955, Eric Rylands, a former {{co-owner}} and {{managing director of}} the Lancashire Aircraft Corporation (LAC) who had bought Skyways from the previous owners in March 1952 (together with LAC's other owner, David Brown), started a coach-air service between London and Paris. Passengers were taken by coach from Victoria Coach Station to Lympne, flown to Beauvais and then taken by coach to Paris. Check-in and coach departures in Paris were at the Hôtel Moderne Palace on Place de la Republique in Paris 12. Aircraft and coaches each held 36 passengers. Passengers returning to the UK <b>could</b> <b>order</b> duty-free goods at Paris and the orders were telephoned to Beauvais for distribution on the flight. The off-peak fare was £7 14s 0d and 47,000 passengers were carried in the first year. Three Dakotas were used initially and later increasing to four. A trial run took place on 21 September and Skyways holding company, Eric Rylands Ltd, bought Lympne from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Melish {{had been}} fielding {{inquiries}} from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received back only postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was {{the peak of}} the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist Q. David Bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar to purchase, at the original issue price, several sets—members of the public <b>could</b> <b>order</b> at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.|$|E
5|$|The NCMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} on 22 August 1984 by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1984 and the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 1984. Under Article 39(1)(b) of the Constitution which {{was introduced by}} the constitutional amendment Act, {{the maximum number of}} NCMPs was set at six. However, the actual number that could be declared elected at any general election was fixed at three, less the total number of Opposition MPs elected to Parliament. The President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, <b>could</b> <b>order</b> that between four and six NCMPs be declared elected for the purpose of a particular general election. Such an order ceased to have effect at the next dissolution of Parliament. On 1 July 2010, the need for a presidential order {{to increase the number of}} NCMPs was removed. Instead, the maximum number of NCMPs in Parliament was increased from six to nine, and the actual number that would be declared elected following a general election would be nine less the number of opposition MPs elected to Parliament.|$|E

5|$|The airline {{reached a}} non-public {{settlement}} with Thor Tjøntveit on 10 September regarding the latter's right to purchase one of Norway Airline's aircraft. Norway Airlines lost NOK12 million in 1990. In January 1991, the airline won {{the contract to}} fly personnel the Norwegian Armed Forces, as the airline priced half a million krone lower than Busy Bee. Operations started in April and secured sufficient business that the airline <b>could</b> <b>order</b> its third aircraft, along with a contract from Gullivers Reiser for additional charter flights. Within a week it received concession to operate scheduled flights between Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm to London. A similar concession was also granted to Braathens SAFE, but they stated that the intense competition on the route would {{make it difficult for}} them to start a service. However, the five-year concession required that Norway Airlines not have any foreign citizens in the board; as two representatives for ILG sat on the board, they would have to resign for the concession to be valid. The Progress Party called for the law to be changed. Norway Airlines also applied for a route from Bergen and Stavanger to London.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic design}} of the new {{building}} was apparently successful, as even before she was completed SF Line's fellow Viking Line members Rederi AB Slite and Rederi Ab Sally asked access to the ship's plans so that they <b>could</b> <b>order</b> additional ships of the same design. However, in the end Slite opted to order a slightly larger vessel from Meyer Werft in Germany, while SF Line refused to give Sally access to the new ship's plans {{and as a result}} Sally too placed an order with Meyer Werft.|$|E
25|$|Although {{its founder}} was gone, the House of Worth was now an {{established}} entity; its most successful years were those flanking 1900.

25|$|The 401 was {{available}} in the Javelin, Matador, and Ambassador car lines and in Jeeps from its introduction in 1971 through 1974. In 1975 and 1976, emission controls, insurance rates, and high gasoline prices meant the 401 {{was available}} on the large Matador model, and then only for police department orders. Buyers of full-sized Jeeps (Wagoneer, Cherokee, J-10 and J-20) <b>could</b> <b>order</b> a 401 until 1979. This engine was also supplied to International Harvester for use as an optional engine in International's Light Line pickup trucks and Travelalls from late 1973 through 1974.|$|E

Should the DG not have such a factual basis, {{he would not be able}} to request for the duty to be paid, and if he did he would have acted upon an incorrect basis of fact.|$|E
25|$|The Joroleman mailbox was {{originally}} approved for manufacture in one size, the No. 1, which could accommodate letter mail, periodicals, newspapers, catalogs, and small parcels. After July 1, 1916, the Joroleman mailbox {{would be the}} only design approved by the Post Office for new curbside mailbox installations. In July 1929, the Post Office approved specifications for a larger Joroleman mailbox known as the No. 2. The No. 2 mailbox, soon followed by the still-larger No. 3, could accept larger parcels and packages sent via Parcel Post; these large boxes proved particularly popular with rural mail recipients, who <b>could</b> <b>order</b> manufactured goods by mail for delivery to the farm or ranch.|$|E

25|$|The Nineteenth Amendment, {{passed in}} May 1998, {{introduced}} a novel method of amendment. Its provisions allowed the later amendment to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution in 1999. The Nineteenth Amendment did not itself amend those articles, but rather introduced a temporary special {{mechanism by which}} the Government <b>could</b> <b>order</b> their amendment once it was satisfied that certain commitments made by other parties to the Good Friday Agreement had been complied with. The sections added to {{the text of the}} Constitution which provided for this later amendment to Articles no longer appear in the published official text of the Constitution, in line with their own provisions.|$|E
25|$|The magistrate's role in {{practice}} faced many other constraints. The runners and yamen officials who {{were sent to}} investigate a crime were locals, often in league with the criminals. Magistrates commonly would therefore set a deadline for bringing in the criminals, threatening to take the policeman's family members as hostage if the deadline was not met. When the accused was brought before him, the magistrate could use torture, such as flogging or making the defendant kneel on an iron chain, but there were clear restrictions. The instruments had to be of a standard size and individually approved by the next higher yamen, and some {{could not be used}} on women or people over the age of seventy. The magistrate <b>could</b> <b>order</b> the use of the ankle-squeezer, for instance, only in cases of murder and robbery, and its use had to be specifically reported to the higher level. Some officials avoided the use of torture because they feared that it would produce false confessions. The magistrate had to make sure that any confession was recorded accurately, word for word, to prevent the clerk from introducing intentional errors that might prejudice the case. The magistrate himself could be punished if he invoked the wrong law or imposed a sentence that was either too harsh or too lenient.|$|E
25|$|The {{plans were}} brought to Robertson, who feeling unwell had dined with Maurice in his room, at around 9pm. In Spears’ famous account Robertson’s face “went the colour of {{mahogany}} … his eyebrows slanted outwards like a forest of bayonets held at the charge – in fact he showed every sign of having a fit” He shouted “Get ‘Aig!”. Haig and Robertson visited Lloyd George – one of Robertson’s objections was that the agreement could not be binding on Dominion troops – who told them {{that he had the}} authority of the War Cabinet and that, although Nivelle’s demands were “excessive”, they must have a scheme agreed by 8am. The next morning, after Nivelle had claimed he had not personally drawn up the scheme and professed astonishment that the British generals had not already been told of it, Robertson “ramped up and down the room, talking about the horrible idea of putting “the wonderful army” under a Frenchman, swearing he would never serve under one, nor his son either, and that no-one <b>could</b> <b>order</b> him to”. Hankey drew up a compromise rather than see Haig and Robertson resign, with Haig still under Nivelle's orders but with tactical control of British forces and right of appeal to the War Cabinet. Robertson later (3 March) regretted even agreeing to this.|$|E

25|$|The High Court {{answered}} {{both questions}} in the negative. The majority, Griffith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ, in separate decisions, applied the decision in the Sawmillers case, holding that the Arbitration Court could not make an award that was inconsistent with a State law. There were two fundamental propositions that were central to the judgments of the majority, (1) the reserved powers doctrine that power to regulate the domestic trade and commerce was reserved to the State and that the Australian parliament could not invade that sphere and (2) that arbitration was the exercise of judicial power and that the Arbitration Court was required to determine the matter according to law, including State law. Section 109 of the Constitution, did not apply because the Arbitration Court was required to declare and administer the law, not make it, thus an award made by the Arbitration Court was not a federal law that would prevail over a State law. Discontent with a State law was not an industrial dispute between employees and their employer. On the question of inconsistency the majority held the question was whether {{it was impossible to}} obey both laws. Because an employer could agree to pay more than the State minimum wage, the Arbitration Court <b>could</b> <b>order</b> the employer to pay more than the minimum.|$|E

[...] O'Connor concluded, however, that the record was too incomplete on this issue, and remanded the issue to the appellate court so that it <b>could</b> <b>order</b> further proceedings.|$|E
