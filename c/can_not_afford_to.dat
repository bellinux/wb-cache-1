40|$|Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge (HSNWR) on Florida’s {{east coast}} {{provides}} undisturbed nesting habitat for three species of threatened or endangered marine turtles. Predation by raccoons and armadillos poses {{the greatest risk}} to turtle nests, and predator control {{has been identified as}} the most important management tool for enhancing nesting productivity. Recently, {{estimates of the number of}} nests that would have been lost in the 2000 nesting and incubation season were made using the results from four control approaches. These approaches were, in order of descending complexity: (1) refuge control enhanced by a one person-month contract with federal control specialists, with that control optimized using a passive tracking methodology for monitoring predators; (2) refuge control enhanced by a one person-month contract with federal control specialists, without predator monitoring; (3) refuge control, but no contract with specialists; (4) no control. In that analysis, approach 1 resulted in the fewest turtles lost to predation. In this paper, we perform a benefit-/cost analysis to determine if operational efficacy translates into economic efficiency. Approach 1 had by far the best benefit-cost ratio for loggerhead turtles, but approach 2 was best for Atlantic green and leatherback turtles. However, almost 90 % of the turtles nesting at HSNWR are loggerhead, and this area is vital to loggerhead survival. Thus, approach 1 also had by far the best benefit-cost ratio over all turtle species, saving approximately $ 1. 7 million over approach 2, $ 2. 6 million over approach 3 and $ 8. 4 million over approach 4. Given these results, one must ask how <b>can</b> we <b>afford</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> control predators, and furthermore, how <b>can</b> we <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> take the minimal extra steps to maximize control efficacy. 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.

6000|$|When I last made a memorandum, {{we were at}} Ephesus. We are in Syria, now, encamped in the {{mountains}} of Lebanon. The interregnum has been long, both as to time and distance. We brought not a relic from Ephesus! After gathering up fragments of sculptured marbles and breaking ornaments from the interior work of the Mosques; and after bringing them at a cost of infinite trouble and fatigue, five miles on muleback to the railway depot, a government officer compelled all who had such things to disgorge! He had an order from Constantinople to look out for our party, and see that we carried nothing off. It was a wise, a just, and a well-deserved rebuke, but it created a sensation. I never resist a temptation to plunder a stranger's premises without feeling insufferably vain about it. This time I felt proud beyond expression. I was serene {{in the midst of the}} scoldings that were heaped upon the Ottoman government for its affront offered to a pleasuring party of entirely respectable gentlemen and ladies I said, [...] "We that have free souls, it touches us not." [...] The shoe not only pinched our party, but it pinched hard; a principal sufferer discovered that the imperial order was inclosed in an envelop bearing the seal of the British Embassy at Constantinople, and therefore must have been inspired by the representative of the Queen. This was bad--very bad. Coming solely from the Ottomans, it might have signified only Ottoman hatred of Christians, and a vulgar ignorance as to genteel methods of expressing it; but coming from the Christianized, educated, politic British legation, it simply intimated that we were a sort of gentlemen and ladies who would bear watching! So the party regarded it, and were incensed accordingly. The truth doubtless was, that the same precautions would have been taken against any travelers, because the English Company who have acquired the right to excavate Ephesus, and have paid a great sum for that right, need to be protected, and deserve to be.

40|$|This paper solves an empirically {{parameterized}} {{model of}} households’ optimal demand for nominal and inflation indexed annuities. The model incorporates mortality, inflation, and {{real interest rate}} risk. The model draws some interesting predictions. First, the welfare calculations on the access to annuities markets show that nominal annuities are welfare improving even when sold at the empirically parameterized cost, which is above fair value. Real annuities are welfare improving over nominal annuities when sold at a fair price, but when we incorporate the empirically parameterized annuity premium the gains become negative at all wealth levels. Second, the simulation of {{the model for the}} British population wealth distribution shows that an important explanation for the little interest in annuities {{comes from the fact that}} annuities are extremely expensive, compared with the total accumulated assets held by households. In other words many households <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> even <b>to</b> enter the annuity market.
