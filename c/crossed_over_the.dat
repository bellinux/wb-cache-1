5|$|In 1806, {{explorer}} David Thompson set {{out from}} Saskatchewan to find {{the source of the}} Columbia. He <b>crossed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Canadian Rockies through Howse Pass and eventually arrived {{on the banks of the}} Kootenay, which he thought to be the Columbia. Thompson traveled down the river a ways but turned back when he was attacked by Native Americans. The following year, Thompson, his family, and several men made another attempt at finding the Columbia. They <b>crossed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Rockies at a more northerly spot and traveled down the Blaeberry River to the Columbia, eventually discovering Columbia Lake and establishing there the trading post Kootenae House. In the spring of 1808, he set off down the Kootenay River, this time reaching present-day Montana and Idaho where he established Kullyspell House and Saleesh House, trading posts on Lake Pend Oreille and the Clark Fork, respectively. After spending a winter in Montana, he tried to reach the Columbia by traveling down the Pend Oreille River but failed in this attempt, eventually returning to Kootenae House via the Kootenay River northwards the following spring.|$|E

It passed through the Lesser Antilles on October1, and later stalled in the eastern Caribbean Sea. On October8, the depression <b>crossed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Dominican Republic, and subsequently it accelerated to the northeast.

The typhoon continued to intensify, and the JTWC estimates that it reached its peak intensity at 0600 UTC, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 130km/h (80mph).

Bad weather drove them back, though, and they landed at Cardiff. Edward retreated to Caerphilly Castle and attempted to rally his remaining forces.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{network of}} allies in Normandy became {{stronger}} during 1103. Henry married Juliana, {{one of his}} illegitimate daughters, to Eustace of Breteuil, and another illegitimate daughter, Matilda, to Rotrou, the Count of Perche, on the Normandy border. Henry attempted to win over {{other members of the}} Normandy nobility and gave other English estates and lucrative offers to key Norman lords. Duke Robert continued to fight Robert of Bellême, but the Duke's position worsened, until by 1104, he had to ally himself formally with Bellême to survive. Arguing that Duke Robert had broken the terms of their treaty, Henry <b>crossed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Channel to Domfront, where he met with senior barons from across Normandy, eager to ally themselves with the King.
