It branches northwards in Crymlyn Burrows and terminates at the <b>Crymlyn</b> <b>Bog</b> nature reserve, now a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The SSSI covers {{an area of}} , and has been designated {{because of the presence}} of fen and wet woodland habitats. It is also a RAMSAR site and a Special Area of Conservation.

50|$|It {{developed}} {{in ancient times}} in the estuary of the River Clydach and River Neath, which once flowed through the present day site of the bog.The <b>Crymlyn</b> <b>Bog</b> is an historic boundary between 'South' and 'West Wales', between the lordships of Morgannwg and Gwy^r, and between the medieval and modern (i.e. until 1923) dioceses of St. David's and Llandâf.|$|R
50|$|Crymlyn Burrows {{is an area}} of land in Wales, UK to {{the east}} of Swansea city centre, and south of <b>Crymlyn</b> <b>Bog.</b> It is bounded by Jersey Marine Beach to the south and the River Neath to the east.

50|$|His campaigning as an {{environmentalist}} started in 1978. He started {{a campaign to}} stop tipping at <b>Crymlyn</b> <b>Bog</b> which straddles the county boundaries between Neath and Swansea {{being used as a}} landfill site. In 1981 working alongside Friends of the Earth, he obtained permission from the courts to proceed with a Judicial Review regarding the failure of the NCC to notify part of the bog as a protected Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The NCC conceded the case and the site was given protection. <b>Crymlyn</b> <b>Bog</b> achieved international protected status as a Ramsar Site in 1993.The northern limb of the bog, Pant-y-Sais Fen, was also protected {{as a result of his}} campaigning. It was already being filled with rubbish but working with local residents he persuaded the local council to compulsorily purchase the fen as nature reserve. This was the first, and only time a site has been purchased in this way to become a nature reserve.|$|R
50|$|The spider {{was first}} found in South Wales in 2003 in the disused Tennant Canal at Pant-y-Sais Fen. Surveying found a stable {{population}} {{as well as}} identifying further occurrences at the nearby <b>Crymlyn</b> <b>Bog</b> and in connecting wetlands but {{the full range of}} the spider is not fully known. This due to the difficulty of surveying work in wetland terrain and problems with identification. The habitat at the site is considered good enough for the population not to be declining.|$|R
50|$|There {{are plans}} for further housing {{developments}} on both {{east and west}} banks of the River Tawe and a proposal to operate river taxis along the river. A report was commissioned by Natural Resources Wales in 2015 {{as part of its}} 'Tawe Trial' initiative - completed by regeneration consultants Trilein Ltd. it recommended a number of initiatives to better connect the urban areas on the west of the river with the more rural areas of Kilvey Hill and <b>Crymlyn</b> <b>Bog</b> beyond to the east.|$|R
5000|$|Swansea University {{has built}} a 100 acre site close the Fabian Way as a second campus and {{innovation}} park. The development is on land previously used by BP as a petrochemicals transit site which BP gifted to the University. The site stretches from Swansea Docks to <b>Crymlyn</b> <b>Bog.</b> [...] Funding for the project was made available in September 2012 from the Welsh Government and the European Investment Bank. Construction work started on the site in 2013 and main phase completed in 2015, with accommodation blocks still being added. Companies which intend to establish research facilities at the site include Rolls-Royce, Hewlett-Packard, Tata, Bell Labs and BAE.|$|R
5000|$|In written {{evidence}} {{presented to the}} Welsh Assembly's Enterprise and Learning Committee in January 2008, Swansea University stated that it was [...] "at an advanced stage of discussion" [...] about a new 'Innovation Campus' on a second site. On 20 March 2008, the university {{announced that it would}} conduct a more detailed examination and feasibility assessment of a 100 acre site off Fabian Way, covering an area from the docks and the former BP plant to the Site of Special Scientific Interest at <b>Crymlyn</b> <b>Bog.</b> The new campus could be home to Engineering, Computing, Telecommunications, the Business and Law Schools and a range of offices for large and small companies.|$|R
50|$|Plantlife {{found in}} the bog is more typical of that found in East Anglia. Habitats range from swamps, carr (fen), water meadows and tall reed beds to {{waterlogged}} scrub consisting mainly of willow, where wetter areas merge with woodland. There {{are a number of}} plants {{found in the}} wetland that are rare in Great Britain. Examples of these include the slender cotton grass and lesser water plantain.In 2003, surveys of <b>Crymlyn</b> <b>Bog,</b> Pant-y-Sais Fen and the inter-connecting wetlands identified the area as one of only three locations in the UK at which the fen raft spider is found. The extent of the population is unknown but the quality of habitat at the site is considered good enough for the population to be stable.|$|R
5|$|The Tennant Canal was a {{development}} of the Glan-y-wern Canal, which was built across <b>Crymlyn</b> <b>Bog</b> to transport coal from a colliery on its northern edge to a creek on the River Neath called Red Jacket Pill. It closed after 20 years, but was enlarged and extended by George Tennant in 1818, to provide a navigable link from the River Neath to the River Tawe at Swansea docks. In order to increase trade, he built an extension to Aberdulais basin, where it linked to the Neath Canal. The extension was built without an act of Parliament {{and there was a}} long delay while Tennant attempted to resolve a dispute with a landowner over the routing of the canal. Once opened, much of the Neath traffic used the Tennant Canal, as Swansea provided better facilities for transferring cargo to ships.|$|R
5|$|At Swansea, the Tennant Canal {{could be}} relinked to the Prince of Wales Dock, and hence to the River Tawe, {{which has become}} a large marina since the {{construction}} of a tidal barrage. This could then provide a link to a restored Swansea Canal. Associated British Ports, who run Swansea Docks, rejected the idea of a canal link in 1997, but since then the Prince of Wales Dock has become the subject of a regeneration scheme, and a route for the canal has been reserved in the planning document. The feasibility of this scheme and a possible route was investigated in a report by the engineers W. S. Atkins published in 2003. A report for Natural Resources Wales by Trilein Ltd. recommended a range of initiatives to better connect the urban areas of the city to the more rural east of the county, including <b>Crymlyn</b> <b>Bog.</b> The reconnection of the Tennant Canal to the Prince of Wales Dock was again outlined in that report.|$|R
5000|$|Llandarcy {{was chosen}} as a site for a {{refinery}} because Neath Rural district Council was the only council {{in the country at}} that time which could guarantee the requisite daily volume of water required by the refinery. This was supplied from the recently constructed reservoir at Ystradfellte, which was proposed and promoted by Councillor Howells of Skewen. Llandarcy's proximity to Swansea docks, where crude oil could be transported by sea from the Middle East was incidental. Llandarcy was the source of the fuel pipeline PLUTO (Pipe Line Under The Ocean) which supplied fuel to the D-Day landings.The site was damaged by Luftwaffe bombing in 1940. At its peak the refinery was a major employer in South West Wales, with over 2,600 workers. However, it was also responsible for industrial pollution at nearby <b>Crymlyn</b> <b>Bog,</b> an area designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Operations at the refinery were gradually scaled back in the late 20th century, and the site closed in 1998.|$|R
5|$|George Tennant, born in 1765 {{and the son}} of a {{solicitor}} in Lancashire, {{moved to}} the area in 1816, after he had bought the Rhydings estate. The Glan-y-wern Canal was unused at the time, following Lord Vernon's distraint, but Tennant, who had no previous experience with canals, decided to lease it, enlarge it and extend it. He planned to make it suitable for barges of , which would gain access to the river Neath through a lock at Red Jacket. Where the canal turned northwards across <b>Crymlyn</b> <b>Bog,</b> he would extend it to the west, to terminate at a lock into the River Tawe, near Swansea harbour. He believed that Swansea docks would provide a better shipping point than Neath or Giant's Grave, and hoped that the canal would encourage the development of the corridor through which it ran. He attempted to gain support for the scheme from local landowners, but when none was forthcoming, he decided to fund the project himself. Lord Vernon's estate had been inherited by the Earl of Jersey in 1814, and so Tennant leased the Glan-y-wern Canal from him.|$|R

Work started in 1817, {{under the direction of the}} engineer William Kirkhouse, and the canal was completed by autumn 1818, running from near the east pier on the River Tawe at Swansea to the River Neath at Red Jacket. The canal was built to a grander scale than originally intended, and could be navigated by barges of 50 to 60 LT. The main line was 4 mi long, and the 1.4 mi branch to Glan-y-wern was also reopened, for it supplied regular cargoes of coal. Other goods carried included timber, bark, fire-bricks and sand, but the volume of goods carried was not enough to make a profit. He negotiated with the Neath Canal, who gave him permission to build a lock into the river from their canal, either at Giant's Grave or Court Sart pill, but working canal boats across a tidal river would not have been ideal, and he did not build the lock.|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} {{of the effect of}} high {{concentrations}} of heavy metals on the growth of wetland plants, although it is has long been suggested that adaptation to waterlogged anaerobic environments involves the capacity to exclude dissolved iron. This work investigates the chemical dynamics of selected metal toxins, in particular Fe in relation to concentration in the substrate and uptake b y Eriophorum augustifolium, and Phragmites australis taken from mine populations (Parys Mountain, Anglesey and <b>Crymlyn</b> <b>Bog,</b> Swansea) and a non-mine population (Skipwith Common, Yorks) and to provide information on the resistance of these two species to high concentrations of Fe and other heavy metals. Both field and laboratory work have been used to focus on the above areas. The first part of the study is based on the analysis of plants and soil samples collected from the field and relates heavy metal concentration in plant tissue to concentrations in soil/sediments. The second part of the study is based on laboratory work to determine individual factors influencing heavy metal uptake and resistance in the study species. Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn and Pb concentrations in plant tissues reflected those in the soil. Seasonal fluctuations in metal concentration in plant tissues were observed but the bulk differences were related to soil heterogeneity between sites. In culture solutions, Fe uptake in both species increased with increasing Fe supply. E. augustifolium from the Parys site was less sensitive to hi g h Fe concentrations relative to plants from the Skipwith site. Fe-uptake by E angustfolium, was strongly influenced by pH. Fe [...] uptake by plants was unaffected by the presence of Fe-plaques on roots. A relationship between Fe and P is highlighted enhancing P availability to plants of E. augustifolium in th presence of 100 mg /l Fe by treating half the roots with Fe and the remaining half with 0. 1 -strength Rorison solution with 1 mg/l Fe, stimulated root oxidation of Fe and the accumulation of Fe-plaque, reducing translocation of Fe to shoots. P]. ants of the same species with Fe-plaque an the roots accumulated more P than plants without plaque, the bulk of this P was immobile. E. angustifolium from the Parys Mountain site was found to be more tolerant to Cu but more sensitive to Mn, the reverse was true for p). ants from the Skipwith site. The imp 1 ications of this work in relation to plant growth and resistance to heavy metal—enriched environments are discussed. It is suggested that both species may be constitutionally tolerant to Fe and Mn. Plants from the Parus site may be more resistant to high concentrations of Cu, Zn and Pb...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing of near-surface {{hydrological}} conditions within northern peatlands has {{the potential}} to provide important large-scale hydrological information regarding ecological and carbon-balance processes occurring within such systems. This article details how field knowledge of the spectral properties of Sphagnum spp., airborne remote sensing data and a range of image analysis approaches, may be combined to provide a suitable proxy for near-surface wetness. Co-incident field and airborne remote sensing data were acquired in May and September 2002 over an important UK raised <b>bog</b> (<b>Cors</b> Fochno). A combination of laboratory-tested NIR and SWIR water-based and biophysical spectral reflectance indices were applied to field and airborne reflectance spectra of Sphagnum pulchrum to elucidate changes in near-surface moisture conditions. Field results showed significant correlations between water-based indices (moisture stress index (MSI) and floating water band indices (fWBI 980 and fWBI 1200))) and measures of both near-surface volumetric moisture content (VMC) and water-table position. Spectral indices formulated from the NIR (fWBI 980 and fWBI 1200) proved to be the most useful for indicating near-surface wetness across the widest range of moisture conditions because of their ability to penetrate deeper into the Sphagnum canopy. Correlations between a biophysical index based upon chlorophyll content and both hydrological measures were not significant, possibly due to relatively high levels of surface wetness at the field site in both May and September. S. pulchrum lawns were successfully located and mapped from airborne imagery using the mixed tuned match filtering (MTMF) algorithm. Importantly, MSI derived from airborne data was significantly correlated with both field moisture and the water-table position. Relationships between measures of near-surface wetness and the MSI for naturally heterogeneous canopies were, however, found to be weaker for airborne imagery than for associated field data. This {{is likely to be a}} result of the formulation of the MSI itself and the possible preferential detection of “wetter” pixels within the imagery. This effectively reduced the ability of MSI to detect subtle changes in near-surface wetness under high moisture conditions, but would not impede the use of the index under drier conditions. Results from the field data suggest that indices formulated from the NIR may be more suitable for detailed estimations of near-surface and surface wetness at the landscape-scale although reliable hyperspectral data are required to test fully the performance of such indices. The relative merits of using such an approach to determine near-surface hydrological conditions across entire peatland complexes are also discussed. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Future {{anthropogenic}} {{climate forcing}} is forecast to increase storm intensity and frequency over Northern Europe, {{due to a}} northward shift of the storm tracks, and a positive North Atlantic Oscillation. However understanding the significance of such a change is difficult because the natural variability of storminess beyond the range of instrumental data is poorly known. Here we present a decadal-resolution record of storminess covering the Late Holocene, based on a 4 -m-long core taken from the peat <b>bog</b> of <b>Cors</b> Fochno in mid-Wales, UK. Storminess is indicated by variations in the minerogenic content as well as bromine deposited from sea spray. Twelve episodes of enhanced storm activity are identified during the last 4. 5 cal ka BP. Although the age model gives some uncertainty in the timings, it appears that storminess increased at the onset and close of North Atlantic cold events associated with oceanic changes, with reduced storm activity at their peak. Cors Fochno is strongly influenced by westerly moving storms, so {{it is suggested that}} the patterns were due to variations in the intensity of westerly airflow and atmospheric circulation during times when the latitudinal temperature gradient was steepened.

50|$|The {{assessment}} {{designated the}} primary feature for {{the selection of}} Cors Caron as active raised <b>bog</b> described as:The <b>Cors</b> Caron sequence of peat domes (also known as Tregaron Bog) developed on the floodplain of the Afon (River) Teifi in mid-Wales now represents the most intact surviving example in the UK of a raised bog landscape (macrotope). The three main extant domes are hydrologically isolated by the River Teifi and associated surface drainage features, and all three have suffered extensive damage {{as a consequence of}} past drainage and peat-cutting. The river terraces associated with the component bog mesotopes are regularly flooded and support vegetation that includes reed canary-grass Phalaris arundinacea, soft rush Juncus effusus, purple moor-grassMolinia caerulea and, more rarely, water sedge Carex aquatilis. Substantial areas of the surface of each of the three component bogs still retain good quality active raised bog vegetation mainly referable to NVC type M18 Sphagnum papillosum - Erica tetralix community, with frequent bog-rosemary Andromeda polifolia and white beak-sedge Rhynchospora alba and, more locally, the bog-mosses Sphagnum magellanicum and S. pulchrum. Extensive areas with a high cover of heather Calluna vulgaris and deergrass Trichophorum cespitosum are also present, while purple moor-grass M. caerulea is particularly prominent on the more modified bog margins. Although present as an important peat-former until as recently as the 18th century, Sphagnum imbricatum is absent from the contemporary bog flora.|$|R
