5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the account's {{authenticity}} has been questioned {{is the fact that it}} claims St-Calais was knowledgeable in <b>canon</b> <b>law.</b> Offler doubted that <b>canon</b> <b>law</b> had penetrated to England to any great degree in 1088. The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in <b>canon</b> <b>law,</b> since he owned a copy of one of the basis of <b>canon</b> <b>law,</b> the False Decretals. The bishop's manuscript of the Decretals still survives.|$|E
5|$|<b>Canon</b> <b>law</b> {{concerns}} the Catholic Church's life and organisation and {{is distinct from}} civil law. In its own field it gives force to civil law only by specific enactment in matters such as the guardianship of minors. Similarly, civil law may give force in its field to <b>canon</b> <b>law,</b> but only by specific enactment, as with regard to canonical marriages. Currently, the 1983 Code of <b>Canon</b> <b>Law</b> is in effect primarily for the Latin Church. The distinct 1990 Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches (CCEO, after the Latin initials) applies to the autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches.|$|E
5|$|Lichton {{was born}} in the diocese of Brechin (probably Angus) somewhere between 1369 and 1379 to Henry and Janet Lichton. He was well-educated for his time, {{attending}} the University of Orléans and possibly the University of St Andrews, earning licentiates in civil law and <b>canon</b> <b>law,</b> a bachelorate in <b>canon</b> <b>law,</b> and a doctorate in <b>canon</b> <b>law,</b> all achieved between 1394 and 1415; he attained an additional doctoratein civil lawby 1436. Lichton followed an ecclesiastical career simultaneously with his studies. The first notice of this career comes in 1392, when he was vicar of Markinch in Fife, a vicariate of St Andrews Cathedral Priory. He was a canon of the diocese of Moray by 1394, and Archdeacon of Aberdeen by 1395, holding this position into the following year, 1396.|$|E

5|$|He {{may already}} have been a Doctor of Civil Law by that point, because in the {{following}} year, on 22 November 1350, he is found as such acting as the Regent of Orléans presenting a candidate for licence. Having studied civil law for the highest qualification available, de Coventre moved on to <b>canon</b> <b>law.</b> By 28 March 1351, he possessed a Bachelorate in Decrees (<b>canon</b> <b>law).</b> This was perhaps why on 16 April 1353, he obtained from Pope Innocent VI another grace for himself. Precisely when he obtained his doctorate is unclear, but he was D. U. J. (doctor utriusque juris), Doctor of Both Laws, by 4 September 1359.|$|E
5|$|Legal studies {{advanced}} {{during the}} 12th century. Both secular law and <b>canon</b> <b>law,</b> or ecclesiastical law, were {{studied in the}} High Middle Ages. Secular law, or Roman law, was advanced greatly by {{the discovery of the}} Corpus Juris Civilis in the 11th century, and by 1100 Roman law was being taught at Bologna. This led to the recording and standardisation of legal codes throughout Western Europe. <b>Canon</b> <b>law</b> was also studied, and around 1140 a monk named Gratian (fl. 12th century), a teacher at Bologna, wrote what became the standard text of canon law—the Decretum.|$|E
5|$|The next year, {{a council}} held at Westminster {{became one of}} the early stages in the king's growing quarrel with Becket over {{criminal}} clerks. The quarrel was sparked by the problem of clergy who committed crimes; Becket supported the Church's position that all clergy, even those in minor orders, could be tried only in ecclesiastical courts. As perhaps as many as a fifth of the population of England may have been in some form of clerical orders, including the minor ones, allowing this would have diminished the king's authority. In the past, English law had tried clerks who committed serious offences in the royal courts, but recent changes in <b>canon</b> <b>law</b> were changing this practice. At Westminster, Henry tried to get the leading laymen and bishops to swear to uphold the old customs of England, instead of the newer <b>canon</b> <b>law</b> practices. All the bishops swore, with the reservation that the customs were not in conflict with <b>canon</b> <b>law.</b> Hilary, however, added no qualifiers to his oath. Although the oath supported Becket's position, after the council most of the bishops, including Hilary, were persuaded by the king to support some compromise position, and threw their support behind Henry.|$|E
50|$|In his youth, Julian and {{his father}} served {{together}} in the Roman army, and he later became a monk at the Monastery of Qinnasrin. Julian was consecrated Patriarch of Antioch in 688, but quickly came into conflict with Jacob, Archbishop of Edessa, who strictly observed <b>canon</b> <b>laws,</b> and expelled clergymen who disobeyed him. Julian advised Jacob to treat the clergy less severely, however, Jacob responded by travelling to the Monastery of Qinnasrin, Julian's residence, where he set fire to {{a copy of the}} <b>canon</b> <b>laws,</b> criticised the patriarch for his laxity, and abdicated as Archbishop of Edessa.|$|R

5|$|Theobald's {{household}} {{included many}} young men of ability, including his successor Thomas Becket.

Whether Vacarius actually started a school in Theobald's household is unclear, but in the 1140s he taught briefly at Oxford. Theobald was instrumental in fostering the teaching of <b>canon</b> <b>law</b> in England; the conflict that later arose between Henry II and Thomas Becket had its roots in disputes that were exposed during Theobald's time in office. While still in Normandy, Theobald had made an intense study of ecclesiastical or <b>canon</b> <b>law,</b> which he continued after being elected archbishop.|$|E

5|$|From {{the reign}} of King James I, the {{beginnings}} of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised. The growing activity of the parliament and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament to the courts and other enforcers of the law. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to codify, update or define Scots law. The legal uncertainty that this situation created prompted increased reliance on the common law found in <b>Canon</b> <b>law,</b> {{and there are a number}} of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from the common law embodied in Civil and <b>Canon</b> <b>law,</b> which had the advantage of being written.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, {{against the}} {{expressed}} prohibition of Pope John PaulII, he consecrated four bishops {{to continue his}} work with the SSPX.

5|$|In a 1987 sermon Lefebvre, at age 81, {{experiencing}} failing health, {{announced his}} intention to consecrate a bishop to carry on his work after his death.

5|$|Some of John's writings, {{dealing with}} <b>canon</b> <b>law,</b> still survive. They show {{him to have}} been steeped in <b>canon</b> <b>law</b> and quite knowledgeable.
