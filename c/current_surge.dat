5|$|After {{many years}} of decline, the Sheffield economy {{is going through a}} strong revival. The 2004 Barclays Bank Financial Planning study {{revealed}} that, in 2003, the Sheffield district of Hallam was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over £60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by Knight Frank revealed that Sheffield was the fastest-growing city outside London for office and residential space and rents {{during the second half of}} 2004. This can be seen by the <b>current</b> <b>surge</b> of redevelopments, including the City Lofts Tower and accompanying St Paul's Place, Velocity Living and the Moor redevelopment, the forthcoming NRQ and the recently completed Winter Gardens, Peace Gardens, Millennium Galleries and many projects under the Sheffield One redevelopment agency. The Sheffield economy grew from £5.6billion in 1997 (1997 GVA) to £9.2billion in 2007 (2007 GVA).|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} film capacitors is {{their ability to}} withstand high peak voltage or peak <b>current</b> <b>surge</b> pulses. This capability depends on all internal connections of the film capacitor withstanding the peak current loads up to the maximum specified temperature.

25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolytes normally can be charged {{up to the}} rated voltage without any <b>current</b> <b>surge,</b> peak or pulse limitation.

Non-solid electrolytes, as a liquid medium that has an ion conductivity caused by moving ions, are relatively insensitive to voltage spikes or <b>current</b> <b>surges.</b> Solid electrolytes have an electron conductivity, which makes solid electrolytic capacitors sensitive to voltages spikes or <b>current</b> <b>surges.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Metallized film {{capacitors}} {{are made}} of two metallized films with plastic film as the dielectric. A very thin (~ 0.03µm) vacuum-deposited aluminum metallization is applied to one or both sides to serve as electrodes. This configuration can have [...] "self-healing" [...] properties, in that dielectric breakdowns or short circuits between the electrodes do not necessarily lead {{to the destruction of}} the component. With this basic design, it is possible to make high quality products such as [...] "zero defect" [...] capacitors and to produce wound capacitors with larger capacitance values (up to 100µF and larger) in smaller cases (high volumetric efficiency) compared to film/foil construction. However, a disadvantage of metallized construction is its limited <b>current</b> <b>surge</b> rating.|$|E

The voltage distribution studies during non-conduction and conduction modes of surge arrester are made. This study analyses effect of stray capacitance on non-uniformity in the voltage distribution and utilization factor. As the voltage distribution during non-conduction mode {{is important for the}} insulation design, the capacitance distribution for higher rated arrester is studied. The role of stray capacitance during conduction mode is also analysed by computing the residual voltage of arrester for <b>current</b> <b>surges</b> of different front times. The effect of steepness of <b>current</b> <b>surges</b> on voltage distribution is also discussed. Index Terms — surge arrester, stray capacitance, voltage distribution, FEM, utilization factor.

50|$|When the {{capacitor}} {{is connected}} {{directly to the}} bridge, as shown, current flows in {{only a small portion}} of each cycle, which may be undesirable. The transformer and bridge diodes must be sized to withstand the <b>current</b> <b>surge</b> that occurs when the power is turned on at the peak of the AC voltage and the capacitor is fully discharged. Sometimes a small series resistor is included before the capacitor to limit this current, though in most applications the power supply transformer's resistance is already sufficient. Adding a resistor, or better yet, an inductor, between the bridge and capacitor can ensure that current is drawn over a large portion of each cycle and a large <b>current</b> <b>surge</b> does not occur.|$|E

40|$|<b>Surge</b> <b>current</b> {{test data}} {{have been taken}} on as one {{important}} parameter among {{the process of the}} production and application of rectifier diode. According to the National Rectifying Diode <b>Surge</b> <b>Current</b> Testing Standards, <b>surge</b> <b>current</b> is usually generated from transformer and simultaneously tested by some testing special instruments, i. e. oscilloscopes. However, this kind of test can cause problems, such as extra high cost required, <b>surge</b> <b>current</b> waveforms distorted, and great influence made upon power grid fluctuations while high current tested. This paper addresses an efficient method to tackle those problems mentioned above. In this method, <b>surge</b> <b>currents</b> are generated by stored charges, then a microcomputer is adopted to control its surge waveform and the real time data are tested and displayed, such as the currents and voltages through the rectifier tube. Such technique can easily eliminate the effects of defects resulted from those <b>surge</b> <b>current</b> generated by transformer. Furthermore, it’s already proved to be much more accurate, controllable in surge time and peak. Compared with the method of <b>surge</b> <b>current</b> generated by transformer, such energystored method also saves more energy and occupies small volumes of space.

40|$|This thesis proposes {{the use of}} a {{bi-directional}} dual-output converter {{that provides}} output voltages at two different levels. The motivation is because the automotive industry is considering increasing the battery voltage from 12 V to 42 V, creating a need for an isolated dual-output bi-directional converter. The topology used has the advantages of zero-voltage switching in either direction of power flow, high efficiency, and simple control making it promising for high power applications like auxiliary power supply in fuel cell vehicles. A prototype converter is built and tested to verify the analytical work. ^ As a safety issue resulting from a higher voltage electrical system, arc faults in the wiring harness are investigated as these <b>current</b> <b>surges</b> can cause fire or malfunction. This investigation is subdivided into two types of arc faults, series and parallel.
