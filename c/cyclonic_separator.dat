40|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, cyclonic separators are acceptable as hydrocyclone, mist eliminators, separator internal device and compact metering package. Weight and small footprint requirements for {{applications such as}} subsea separation, downhole separation, and compact gas monetization systems is driving interest in using <b>cyclonic</b> <b>separator</b> for bulk gas-liquid separation. Unfortunately, the challenge of coping with the effect of unsteady inlet flow behaviour on the separator performance limit it acceptance for bulk gas-liquid separation. Fundamental understanding of the flow behaviour inside the separator under various inlet flow conditions is required {{to deal with the}} challenge. While most published work have addressed flow behaviour in the lower half of <b>cyclonic</b> <b>separator,</b> this thesis concentrated on the upper half. A gas-liquid pipe <b>cyclonic</b> <b>separator</b> was setup at Cranfield University for bulk gas-liquid separation. Large amount of data at the inlet and upper part of the separator were acquired using electrical resistance tomography (ERT), wire meshes sensor (WMS), conductivity hold up probe and pressure transducers. The acquired data were used in analysing flow regimes, upward swirling liquid film (USLF), zero-net liquid flow (ZNLF), liquid holdup and, general separator performance. It was found from analysis of USLF data that a maximum USLF height exists for every constant superficial liquid velocity. A correlation based on dimensionless numbers was proposed for predicting this height. Experimental results on ZNLF showed that a critical ZNLF also exist above which liquid carryover can take place. The liquid holdup for this critical ZNLF was measured under separator operating condition using ERT and a correlation for predicting the liquid holdup was proposed. Four flow regimes were identified as swirling annular, light-mist heavy-mist and churn using visual observations, ERT, WMS and pressure transducer. A flow regime map was proposed based on gas and liquid Froude number. The performance based on the operating envelope for liquid carryover and pressure drop for horizontal and 270 downward inclined tangential inlet was compared. It was concluded that the separation performance was marginally improved by using an inclined tangential inlet. The pressure drop for the inclined inlet was far greater than that of horizontal inlet. Two inlet nozzles with D–shape were used for separation enhancement. The nozzle that reduces the diameter of full pipe bore by 25 % gave slight improvement but also gave the greatest pressure drop.

It {{is of particular}} concern in relation to school buses because of these vehicles' proximity to sensitive receptors. The goal of this project was to design and construct a system for removing particulate matter from the exhaust of idling diesel vehicles. A cyclonic removal system was selected for its relative economy of fabrication and installation and ease of maintenance. Based on existing models and an iterative design approach, a cyclone-based system constructed and tested on three focal buses, with model years 1992, 1995, and 2007, in the fleet of the Wallingford-Swarthmore School District.

40|$|Abstract – The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{continues}} {{to emphasize the}} need for accelerated cleanup of its sites, including the decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) of former production facilities. At the same time, safeguarding the site personnel, the environment, and potentially affected interests outside the waste management professional field is of paramount importance. The need to balance both the accelerated cleanup, and the safeguarding of all, has spawned innovate, yet highly efficient cleanup technologies. One innovative approach capitalizes on a well-documented technology, cyclonic separation, to effectively remove particles down to sub-micron sizes (0. 2 µm), the size often encountered as “dust particles ” and airborne particulates during cleanup operations – without using traditional filtration techniques. Fine particulates may include radioactive and/or hazardous components, and may represent exposure pathways to cleanup personnel and the environment. Effective removal of particulates is essential to reducing worker exposure and achieving the ALARA principles desired during cleanup. As recent as a decade ago, cyclonic separators were deemed incapable of separating or removing particles less than 10 µm in size. Recent advances, however, are breaking new ground in separator efficiencies. Independent laboratory tests confirm a cyclone can remove particles down to the 0. 2 µm effective diameter range- (comparable to a standard HEPA filter, with a typical efficiency rating in the 0. 3 µm range). Additionally, the <b>cyclonic</b> <b>separator</b> removes the particles from the air-stream, and simultaneously collects the particles in an enclosed container to prevent clogging of downstream filters.

40|$|The Scrubber System {{focuses on}} using HEPA filters and carbon {{filtration}} to purify the exhaust of a Nuclear Thermal Propulsion engine of its aerosols and radioactive particles; however, new technology may {{lend itself to}} alternate filtration options, which may lead to reduction in cost {{while at the same}} time have the same filtering, if not greater, filtering capabilities, as its predecessors. Extensive research on various types of filtration methods was conducted with only four showing real promise: ionization, cyclonic separation, classic filtration, and host molecules. With the four methods defined, more research was needed to find the devices suitable for each method. Each filtration option was matched with a device: <b>cyclonic</b> <b>separators</b> for the method of the same name, electrostatic separators for ionization, HEGA filters, and carcerands for the host molecule method. Through many hours of research, the best alternative for aerosol filtration was determined to be the electrostatic precipitator because of its high durability against flow rate and its ability to cleanse up to 99. 99 % of contaminants as small as 0. 001 micron. Carcerands, which are the only alternative to filtering radioactive particles, were found to be non-existent commercially because of their status as a "work in progress" at research institutions.

40|$|The {{offshore}} {{petroleum industry}} is experiencing challenges as {{exploration and production}} are forced towards remote and deep reservoirs, combined with high cost-efficiency demands. Topside facilities struggle with limited space, and use of subsea processing equipment is increasing. Here, separation systems {{play an important role}} and has potential for improvement. <b>Cyclonic</b> <b>separators</b> are often referred to in association with compact separation systems. However, other types of separators have the potential of achieving compact designs. In order to meet rising challenges in the industry, this project involves an analytical and experimental study, seeking alternative or improved compact separation solutions. To define the state of existing technology, the analysis involved studies of fluid dynamic theory, gravitational and centrifugal separation principles, and "state-of-the-art" separators and concepts. The objective with the experimental study was to investigate separation capabilities for the less common centrifugal principle, namely the helically coiled pipe. The results of the analytical study implied that most compact systems utilise the centrifugal principle. Factors promoting the helical coil principle were defined. This included a simple pipe structure, excellent pressure-containment abilities, and previous helical coil experiments showed promising phase distributions. However, achieving stable phase distributions to allow separation seemed sensitive to variations in flow rate and coiled pipe geometry. The experimental study featured an air-water flow in a helically coiled pipe. The flow in the coiled pipe was photographed for a range of air and water flow rates, different numbers of loops, and different curvature radii. Images indicated that above certain air flow rates, the coiled pipe caused transition from stable to unstable phase distribution. Unstable phase distributions were typically recognised as plug or slug flow. The effect of having more than one loop in the coil reduced the air flow rate at which unstable flow developed. The effect of shortening the curvature radii increased the air flow rate that caused unstable flow. In other words, the helical coil achieved best results for short curvature length, either by minimising the number of loops or reducing the curvature radius. These measures indirectly caused a higher flow rate, because shorter curvature length reduces the frictional pressure loss. In addition, shorter curvature radius and higher flow rate increase the centrifugal effects. A different observation was that despite maintaining a favourable phase distribution throughout the coiled pipe, an instant transition to unstable flow could occur at coil outlet. This indicated that the stable distribution may not sustain downstream of the coil. The level of similitude between the experimental flow and a hypothetical full-scale gas-liquid flow was analysed. The analysis indicated that the experiment could suffer from scale-effects, because viscous- and surface tension forces become significant at small scales. The experimental study gave indications on separation capabilities, as achievement of stable phase distribution was possible for certain coil configurations and flow rates. However, the narrow operating range, and possible errors in the experiment, brought uncertainties to whether a full-scale helical coil could achieve phase separation. Hence the results in this thesis could neither prove nor disprove the helical coil as a phase separator. More comprehensive research is required to determine the separation capabilities. Recommendations for further work include larger experimental dimensions to reduce scale-effects, and using fluids that improve similarities to hydrocarbon flows...|$|R
40|$|The need of {{exploiting}} the offshore oil reserves {{and reducing the}} equipment costs becomes the motivation for developing new compact separation techniques. In the past years, the development of compact separators has almost solely focused on the <b>cyclonic</b> type <b>separators</b> made of pipes, because of their simple construction, relatively low cost of manufacturing {{and being able to}} withstand high pressures. Considerable effort has been put into the separator test program and qualification, and consequently notable advances in the compact separation technique have been made. However the application has been held back due to lacking of reliable predicting and design tools. The objectives of this study were threefold. Firstly, an experimental study was carried out aiming at understanding the separation process and flow behaviours in a compact separator, named Pipe-SEP, operating at high inlet gas volume fraction (GVF). Secondly it is to gain insight of the gas and liquid droplet flow in the compact separator by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Last but not least, the understanding and insight gained above were used to develop a comprehensive performance predictive model, based on which, a reliable optimizing design procedure is suggested. An experimental study was carried out to test a 150 -mm Pipe-SEP prototype with a water-air mixture. Three distinct flow regimes inside the Pipe-SEP were identified, namely swirled, agitated, and gas blow-by. The transition of the flow regimes was found to be affected by inlet flow characteristics, mixture properties, geometry of the separator, and downstream conditions. A predictive model capable of predicting the transition of flow regimes and the separation efficiency was developed. A comparison between the predicted result and experiment data demonstrated that the model could serve as a design tool to support decision-making in early design stages [...] . [cont. ]...|$|R

40|$|A novel design {{axial flow}} <b>cyclonic</b> <b>separator</b> called I-SEP was tested with an {{extensive}} set of experiments using air-water {{two phase flow}} mixture at atmospheric pressure. These experiments provided valuable data on the separation efficiency and pressure drop under different inlet conditions. The performance parameters i. e. Gas Carry Under (GCU) and Liquid Carry Over (LCO) {{were found to be}} non-linearly related to the inlet operating conditions. However it was found that resistance on the tangential outlet of the I-SEP affects the GCU and that manipulating the pressure difference between the two outlets and the inlet of the I-SEP through manual control valves, the GCU could be controlled. The separator was also extensively tested and compared with a gravity separator, when they were placed at the exit of a riser, in severe slugging condition frequently encountered in the production pipe work from some oil fields. The tests revealed that the I-SEP has better tendency to suppress severe slugging as compared to the gravity separator. A framework for neural network based on multiple types of input was also developed to model the separation performance of the I-SEP. Mutual Information (one of the key elements of the information theory) was applied to select the appropriate candidate input variables to the neural network framework. This framework was then used to develop a neural network model based on dimensionless input parameters such as pressure coefficient. This neural network model produced satisfactory prediction on unseen experimental data. The inverse function of a trained neural network was combined with a PID controller in a closed loop to control the GCU and LCO at a given set point by predicting the manipulating variable i. e. pressure at the I-SEP outlets. This control scheme was simulated using the test data. Such controller could be used to assist the operator in maintaining and controlling the GCU or LCO at the I-SEP outlets. The work performed during this study also includes the development of a data repository system to store and query the experimental result.

40|$|A Department of Energy funded {{contract}} {{involved the}} development of porous metal as a HEPA filter, and the subsequent design of a full-scale regenerable HEPA filtration system (RHFS). This RHFS could replace the glass fiber HEPA filters currently being used on the high level waste (HLW) tank ventilation system with a system that would be moisture tolerant, durable, and cleanable in place. The origins of the contract are a 1996 investigation at the Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) {{regarding the use of}} porous metal as a HEPA filter material. This contract was divided into Phases I, IIA and IIB. Phase I of the contract evaluated simple filter cylinders in a simulated High Level Waste (HLW) environment and the ability to clean and regenerate the filter media after fouling. Upon the successful completion of Phase I, Phase IIA was conducted, which included lab scale prototype testing and design of a full-scale system. The work completed under Phase IIA included development of a full-scale system design, development of a filter media meeting the HEPA filtration efficiency that would also be regenerable using prescribed cleaning procedures, and the testing of a single element system prototype at Savannah River. All contract objectives were met. The filter media selected was a nickel material already under development at Mott, which met the HEPA filtration efficiency standard. The Mott nickel media met and exceeded the HEPA requirement, providing 99. 99 % removal against a requirement of 99. 97 %. Double open-ended elements of this media were provided to the Savannah River Test Center for HLW simulation testing in the single element prototype filter. These elements performed well and further demonstrated the practicality of a metallic media regenerable HEPA filter system. An evaluation of the manufacturing method on many elements demonstrated the reproducibility to meet the HEPA filtration requirement. The full-scale design of the Mott RHFS incorporated several important features in its design and operation. The element bundle would be an all welded assembly, which could be removed and replaced as a unit if the elements ever needed replacement. Each element had a spray nozzle mounted above it for cleaning; it could also be cleaned by a soak and backwash technique. The inlet nozzle incorporated a <b>cyclonic</b> <b>separator</b> to initially remove large suspended material and droplets. Tests indicated a significant reduction of dirt load getting to the filter elements, which would extend the operating time between cleanings. A high capacity blower was selected to overcome the higher pressure drop of the metallic elements. The blower, having a 25 horsepower motor, would be capable of operating the system to higher pressure drops than available on the glass fiber HEPA filters. This additional capacity further increases the operating duration of the filter. Upon successful testing and acceptance of the full-scale design, Phase IIB would involve the construction and test of a full-scale prototype system on an actual HLW tank. Phase IIA was completed but for funding and priority reasons the contract was halted; thus Phase IIB would not be pursued at this time. The Mott RHFS has been proven at each stage of the development process to meet the requirements of a suitable replacement system for the glass fiber HEPA filters enabling great cost savings. It remains to test a full-scale operating system on an actual high level waste tank to fully demonstrate the performance and anticipated cost savings of the Mott RHFS. Mott is confident that the performance will be more than acceptable...|$|E
40|$|Complex three {{dimensional}} particle-fluid flow operations (for example {{pneumatic conveying}} systems, <b>cyclonic</b> <b>separator</b> unit operations, circulating fluidised beds and dense medium cyclones) are encountered in many industries including energy, mineral, metallurgical, petroleum, environmental, pharmaceutics and materials, and is core in process/chemical engineering. One approach to optimise these industrially important operations {{is to develop}} a fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and mechanics of each operation. With this knowledge, the application of each technology to particular circumstances can be optimised to maximise business profitability. In this treatise presented in this thesis, a fundamental model, i. e., combined discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) (DEM-CFD or CFD-DEM) model, has been attempted in a numerical study of complex three dimensional particle-fluid flows. In the DEM-CFD model, the motion of particles is modelled as a discrete phase, described by Newton's laws of motion applied at an individual particle scale, and the flow of fluid (gas or liquid) is treated as a continuum phase, described by the local averaged Navier-Stokes equations applied at a computational cell scale, while allowing the mutual interaction (e. g., momentum, heat and mass transfer) between particle and fluid phases. This method is recognised as an effective approach of studying the fundamentals of particle-fluid flow by various investigators. It is now increasingly used worldwide, but so far, its application is limited to relatively simple flow systems, mainly because the code development for the solution of fluid phase can be very challenging and time-consuming when complicated dense particle-fluid flow systems are considered. In this approach developed in this thesis, taking advantage of the available CFD development, a DEM-CFD model has been developed and extended, {{and for the first time}} combined with the most popular commercial CFD software, i. e. Fluent, as the platform, achieved by incorporating explicit DEM code and a coupling scheme between DEM and CFD into Fluent through its User Defined Functions (UDFs). The applicability of the developments is demonstrated in the study of the particle-fluid flow in various complex 3 D systems including pneumatic conveying bends, cyclone separator, circulating fluidised bed (CFB), and dense medium cyclones (DMCs). By comparing the numerical findings with experimental measurements, it is shown that the numerical results qualitatively capture some of the flow features typical to those flow systems considered, such as: roping and particle segregation in the pneumatic conveying bends; strands flow and reduction of tangential velocity after loading solids in the gas cyclone separator; core-annulus flow structure and axial solid segregation in the CFB; and &# 147;surging&# 148;, performance deterioration with decrease of medium-to-coal ratio and particle size, and the extraordinary effect of coal type in the DMCs. Quantitative agreements between simulated results with those measured were also obtained in various aspects, such as the periodical fluctuation of pressure drop in the pneumatic conveying bend, the decrease of pressure drop with increase of solid loading rate in the gas cyclone separator, the separation error and density as a function of particle size in the DMC. The internal flow structures are analysed by use of particle velocity and concentration, fluid/slurry flow field (velocity, pressure and density), particle-fluid, particle-particle and particle-wall interaction forces, which leads to an improved understanding of the flow mechanisms of these systems. The obtained intensity of particle-particle and particle-wall interactions can be used to study the attrition of solids and the erosion (wear) of walls in those systems respectively...|$|E
