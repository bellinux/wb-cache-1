40|$|The {{object of}} the study was to compare the results <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>of</b> dairy cows by using type <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> dose, convertional or sexed. The {{hypothesis}} is an assumption of higher level of heifers conception rate after insemination by convertional dose than by using a sexed dose. The evaluation was conducted on the farm ZEAS Podorlicko a. s in the period from June 25 th, 2013 to November 2 nd, 2015 and there were monitored 998 heifers. Data for the evaluation were processed from the farm records and was created a database of heifers conception rate due to the type <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> doses. For the statistical processing was used software SAS 9. 3. In the group of heifers was observed influence month, year, the rank <b>of</b> the <b>insemination</b> and type <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> dose on the age <b>of</b> first <b>insemination</b> and its result. At the level of significance (P < 0, 001) was observed negative effect <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> on age <b>of</b> first <b>insemination</b> (r = - 0, 195). It was also proved, that year <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> has effect on result of conception rate (r = 0, 068) and the result insemination had a positive effect on age at first insemination. These two phenomena were detected at the level of significance (P < 0. 05). Therefore, it was achieved a better level of conception rate in 2015 than in previous years (2013 and 2014) and also was demonstrated higher levels of successful conception rates with increasing age of heifers at first insemination. Based on statistical significance (P < 0. 001) I found that level of heifers conception rate was higher after convertional insemination dose (65. 69 %) than sexed dose (37. 28 %). There was also a statistically significant difference between the month <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> and its result. On the other side, there was no statistically significant effect <b>of</b> rank <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> on its result. According to those results the hypothesis, that there si higher level of conception rate by using convertional insemination dose, can be confirmed. The findings show us, that it is necessary to focus on reproduction in various parts of the year, especially in September, October, November and December, where the conception rate was lowest...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{relationship}} was explored between general immune reactivity, as estimated by the cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity reaction (CBHR) to phytohemagglutinin (PHA), {{and the level of}} anti-sperm antibodies of the Ig A and Ig G class in the cervical mucus and sera of cows with different reproductive results. The hypersensitivity test was performed on the day <b>of</b> artificial <b>insemination</b> when cervical mucus and sera samples were also collected. The animals were divided into groups according to the total number <b>of</b> <b>inseminations,</b> number <b>of</b> <b>inseminations</b> per calving and their age. The titer of antibodies was determined by the indirect immunofluorescence method using sperm cells suspended in Tris egg-yolk extender. Our results indicate that the intensity of CBHR is lowest in cows inseminated once or twice and in younger animals, while, there were no differences between the groups when they were formed according to the number <b>of</b> <b>inseminations</b> per calving.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the contribution of cow factors to the probability <b>of</b> successful <b>insemination</b> accounting for the serial number <b>of</b> <b>inseminations</b> in analysis. The investigation was performed with 101 297 insemination records in 51 525 lactations of different cows from 1368 herds obtained from the Dutch milk production recording database. Cows that had a first insemination (AI) between 40 and 150 days post-partum with one or more inseminations (= 6 inseminations) were selected. An insemination was defined successful when not followed by another insemination and when the cow calved between 267 and 295 days after insemination, or when the cow was culled between 135 and 295 days after the last insemination. Breed, parity, days in milk, lactation curve characteristics, milk production traits, moment of AI related to peak milk yield time (before or after peak milk yield), the last calf (female, male, twin or stillbirth) and season <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> were selected as independent parameters for a model with successful rate <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> as dependent parameter. A multivariable logistic regression model was used within cow and farm as a random effect. The probability <b>of</b> successful <b>insemination</b> was the highest in the first insemination and decreased in the following inseminations. However, the success rate <b>of</b> all <b>inseminations</b> increased in a later stage of lactation. The improvement in the successful inseminations in a later stage of lactation was better in multiparous cows than in first parity cows. Insemination in summer and before peak milk yield time reduced the success <b>of</b> <b>insemination.</b> The success rate was the lowest in 100 % Holstein Friesian cows compared with other breeds and was the highest when the last calf was a female calf compared to a male calf, twin or stillbirth. In conclusion, the success of first and following inseminations depended on parity, breed, season <b>of</b> <b>insemination,</b> last calf status, daily milk yield at insemination date, serial insemination number and days in milk at insemination dat...|$|R

The mares were inseminated with semen from only one stallion, diluted in minimal contamination extender. There were no differences in the conception rate at first cycle, conception/cycle, conception total, efficiency of pregnancy in either system of rectal palpation, independently of the frequency <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> utilized. Also {{there were no differences}} among intervals of rectal palpation concerning the following reproductive characteristics: number of cycles/mare, cycles/pregnant mare, cycles/ pregnancy, pregnancy/cycle, number of inseminations/mare, inseminations/ pregnant mare and insemination/open mare.

40|$|The timely {{detection}} of oestrus presents an important professional procedure with which cattle farmers, {{in addition to}} veterinarians, are very often faced, because failure to detect oestrus poses a big economic problem. The objective of this work is to evaluate the efficacy of discovering oestrus in cows by determining the progesterone concentration (P 4) in blood plasma. This experiment covered 22 animals, including 15 cows and 7 heifers, in which spontaneous oestrus was discovered. P 4 concentration was determined using the ELISA test in samples of blood taken from the animals at the moment <b>of</b> <b>insemination.</b> <b>Of</b> the 15 cows, four cows (26. 6 %) were not inseminated at the optimal time, and the P 4 level in these animals was higher than 1 ng/ml. All the heifers showed a progesterone concentration of over 1 ng/ml, and a percentage of conception which was 85 %. The high P 4 level in heifers at the moment <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> {{could also be a}} consequence of stress caused by the regrouping and separating of the animals. Even though the heifers were under stress, which is indicated by the high progesteronemia values at the moment <b>of</b> <b>insemination,</b> the percentage <b>of</b> conception among them was beyond expectations. Therefore, the determination of P 4 values at the moment <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> is a suitable method for improving reproduction management on cattle farms. Inappropriate treatment of cows which are expected to show oestrus can cause stress and an increase in the values of the blood concentration of P 4.
