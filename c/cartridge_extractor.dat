2500|$|The 76/40 Model 1916 was {{a fairly}} {{complicated}} design with an A tube, a shrunk on jacket that extended to the breech, and a B tube which extended to the muzzle. Over the jacket and B tube a C hoop was shrunk on, which screwed onto the jacket and secured the B tube. [...] There was a shortened version of the gun called the 76/30 Model 1915, which was used on a few classes of destroyers, submarines, tugs and minesweepers. [...] The 76/30 Model 1915 were also used as truck mounted artillery during both world wars. [...] The mounts for the Italian guns were different than their British counterparts and there were five different varieties. [...] The quick fire breech was identical {{to that of the}} Royal Navy gun, except for the <b>cartridge</b> <b>extractor</b> and the firing mechanism. Traverse and elevation were manual and a crew of seven were needed to man the gun. [...] The guns fired fixed quick fire ammunition and a crew could sustain a rate of fire ranging from 12-15 rounds per minute.|$|E
50|$|Since the <b>cartridge</b> <b>extractor</b> or ejector {{is built}} into the barrel {{assembly}} on break open actions, the breech face is simply a flat plate with a hole for the firing pin to project. This makes break open actions ideal for interchangeable barrel firearms, such as the popular Thompson Center Arms Contender and Encore pistols. The simplicity of the break open design, especially external hammer types, also reduces the cost of manufacture. There were a number of companies, such as H&R Firearms, that produced break open rifles at lower costs than comparable bolt action rifles.|$|E
5000|$|The 18-pounder was a quick-firing horse-drawn field gun {{designed}} to be towed behind a limber and six horses. The gun barrel was wire bound nickel-steel with a single-motion screw breech with a <b>cartridge</b> <b>extractor.</b> It fired a fixed round of shell and cartridge fixed together, which was known as [...] "quick firing" [...] in British terminology. The lower carriage comprised a single hollow steel trail fixed to {{the centre of the}} axle-tree. The limited traverse saddle supported the elevating mass and a shield. Traverse controls were on the left and elevation on the right of the saddle. Recoil was by a hydraulic buffer with telescopic running-up springs to return the barrel to its firing position.|$|E
50|$|The Remington 700 {{action is}} {{designed}} for mass production. It is a manually operated bolt action with two forward dual-opposed lugs. The bolt face is recessed, fully enclosing {{the base of the}} <b>cartridge,</b> The <b>extractor</b> is a C-clip sitting within the bolt face. The ejector is a plunger on the bolt face actuated by a coil spring. The bolt is of 3-piece construction, brazed together (head, body and bolt handle). The receiver is milled from round cross-section steel.|$|R
5000|$|The spent <b>cartridge</b> casing <b>extractor</b> is {{installed}} inside the bolt head, while the tilting lever ejector {{is contained in}} the trigger housing. The rifle is hammer-fired and has a trigger group with a fire control selector that enables semi-automatic, burst and continuous fire. The fire selector's positions are marked with bullet pictograms and it {{also serves as a}} manual safety against unintentional discharge. The selector is ambidextrous and its lever is mirrored {{on both sides of the}} trigger housing. In the [...] "safe" [...] position, the trigger and sear are disabled.|$|R
5000|$|A rim is an {{external}} flange that is machined, cast, molded, stamped or pressed around {{the bottom of}} a firearms cartridge. Thus, rimmed cartridges are sometimes called [...] "flanged" [...] cartridges. Almost all <b>cartridges</b> feature an <b>extractor</b> or headspacing rim, {{in spite of the fact}} that some cartridges are known as [...] "rimless cartridges". The rim may serve a number of purposes, including providing a lip for the extractor to engage, and sometimes serving to headspace the cartridge ...|$|R
50|$|The breech {{is locked}} by a {{rotating}} bolt, with two locking lugs engaging locking recesses in the receiver. The gas piston is hinged to the bolt carrier assembly, and its vertical travel {{makes it possible}} to bend the group making machine gun assembly and disassembly for maintenance easier. The protruding rear part of the bolt carrier assembly features spiral shaped cuts, which provide a controlled rotation of the bolt. The mainspring is accommodated in the bolt carrier assembly slide channel. A <b>cartridge</b> <b>extractor</b> with a latch is mounted in the rear part of the bolt carrier assembly. The cocking lever, mounted on the right, is not integral with the bolt carrier and does not reciprocate as the gun fires.The machine gun fires from the rear sear.|$|E
50|$|To {{correct this}} problem, the Model 1868 used a new barrel instead of {{relining}} the original older barrel. The new barrel was slightly shorter, 32.5 inches, {{compared to the}} 36.5-inch barrel used on the Model 1866. The shorter barrel was affixed using only two barrel bands, instead of the three used on the Model 1866. Since it lacked the middle barrel band, the sling was affixed to the upper barrel band instead. The Model 1868 also differed from previous models in that it used a separate Allin type receiver with the barrel attached to it. The Model 1868 {{was also the first}} trapdoor conversion to use the <b>cartridge</b> <b>extractor</b> covered by U.S. Patent No. 68,009, issued August 27, 1867 to W.H. & G.W. Miller. The Model 1868 had an overall length of 51 inches.|$|E

5000|$|Moon {{clips and}} {{half-moon}} clips are special speedloaders {{for use with}} revolvers that chamber rimless cartridges, such as 9×19mm Parabellum or [...]45 ACP. Double-action revolvers are designed to use rimmed <b>cartridges,</b> and the <b>extractors</b> are incapable of removing rimless cartridges. Because of this fact, a different method of extraction must be used. Moon clips are a full circle, and hold a full cylinder of cartridges, while half-moon clips are semicircles that hold half a cylinder full of cartridges.|$|R
5000|$|The M1918 is a {{selective}} fire, air-cooled automatic rifle using a gas-operated long-stroke piston rod actuated by propellant gases bled through a vent in the barrel. The bolt is locked by a rising bolt lock. The gun fires {{from an open}} bolt. The spring-powered <b>cartridge</b> casing <b>extractor</b> is contained in the bolt and a fixed ejector is installed in the trigger group. The BAR is striker fired (the bolt carrier serves as the striker) and uses a trigger mechanism with a fire selector lever that enables operating in either semi-automatic or fully automatic firing modes. The selector lever {{is located on the}} left side of the receiver and is simultaneously the manual safety (selector lever in the [...] "S" [...] position - weapon is [...] "safe", [...] "F" [...] - [...] "Fire", [...] "A" [...] - [...] "Automatic" [...] fire). The [...] "safe" [...] setting blocks the trigger.|$|R
5000|$|The bolt {{also has}} a <b>cartridge</b> casing <b>extractor,</b> while the ejector is located inside the trigger housing (the ejector is lifted by a spring {{in the front of}} the trigger housing. The {{recoiling}} bolt carrier pushes the rear of the ejector down insuring the ejector is lifted into place to insure ejection is timed properly). The weapon is hammer-fired and has a fire control lever, which is also the manual safety. The safety and fire selector lever is located on the left side of the receiver, directly above the pistol grip, and has three settings: [...] "S" [...] (Spanish: Seguro)—weapon safe (trigger is disabled mechanically), [...] "T" [...] (Spanish: Tiro a tiro)—semi-automatic fire and [...] "R" [...] (Spanish: Ráfaga)—fully automatic fire (initial production rifles also had a burst selector option, which was abandoned). The Model L fires from a closed bolt position and uses the NATO-standard 5.56×45mm cartridge loaded with the 62-grain SS109 projectile. INI (Instituto Nacional de Industria, a state factory) made ammunition was dirtier and gave much more chamber pressure than standard NATO ammunition, and was one of the sources of reliability problems (hard primers were in part responsible, too). At NATO joint exercises, foreign units tended to be warned not to use Spanish ammo if their rifles were gas operated needed.|$|R
5000|$|Central to the prosecution's {{case was}} that the CZ-27 pistol Barlow {{disposed}} of at the landfill was the murder weapon. It was believed that the murder weapon must have been fitted with a silencer, as otherwise the four shots would have been extremely loud, {{and no one in}} the vicinity at the time reported hearing any shots.While it would have been possible to match up the bullets recovered from the crime scene by comparing rifling characteristics with the CZ-27's original barrel, this would prove impossible as Barlow had removed the barrel and disposed of it. [...] Not only had the barrel been replaced, but Barlow had also filed down the firing pin and <b>cartridge</b> case <b>extractor</b> claws as well as substituting the original magazine with a homemade one. The prosecution alleged that Barlow made these alterations in an attempt to prevent the identification of the CZ-27 pistol as the murder weapon. Peter Wilson, a forensic scientist from the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) testified that he compared the crime scene bullets with the bullets that Barlow had thrown away at the landfill and concluded that they matched. One of the crime scene bullets was also sent to the Geco ammunition company in Germany, where a computer test confirmed not only was the bullet a Geco brand bullet, but that it was chemically identical to one of the bullets taken from the box of ammunition that Barlow had disposed of at the landfill.|$|R
5000|$|FN {{introduced}} the revolutionary model 1905 in 1905. Despite the name FN {{used for this}} pistol, it was later marketed as the [...] "M1906", the [...] "V.P[...]25" [...] (V.P. denoting Vest Pocket), and most confusingly, the [...] "Baby" [...] model. This pistol was introduced more or less {{at the same time}} the 6.35x16mm [...]25 ACP cartridge became widely available. The term [...] "ACP" [...] stands for [...] "Automatic Colt Pistol". This cartridge was among the first automatic pistol cartridges to be utilized worldwide. It was designed with a [...] "semi-rimmed" [...] shell casing made of brass. The rim of the shell casing had a slightly larger circumference than the base of the <b>cartridge</b> and an <b>extractor</b> groove was cut directly above it. The shell casing head was spaced on this small rim; however, the utilization of the rim in this design complicated the mechanics of the cartridge because, while still in the magazine, the rim of one cartridge would sometimes get hung up on the extractor groove of the following cartridge (also known as [...] "rim lock").|$|R
25|$|PT-76B (Ob'yekt 740B, 1959) - PT-76 {{armed with}} the D-56TS 76.2mm rifled tank gun (double-baffle muzzle brake, <b>cartridge</b> ejector, fume <b>extractor</b> and STP-2P 'Zarya' 2-axis {{stabilization}} system), the PAZ (protivo-atomnaya zashchita) NBC protection system, an automatic fire extinguishing system, improved TShK-2-66 sight, a filtration-ventilation system, improved observation devices, improved electric equipment, a new V-6B 6-cylinder 4-stroke in line water-cooled diesel engine developing 263hp (196kW) at 1800rpm and additional internal fuel tanks for which {{the shape of the}} armour had to be slightly changed. These additional internal fuel tanks increased the fuel capacity from 250 l to 400 l. The new engine is the same as that used in one bank of that fitted to the T-54. With the new engine and additional fuel tanks, the range of the vehicle has been increased to 480km on the road, (590km with external fuel tanks) and 120km on the water. The 76.2mm D-56TS rifled tank gun can fire a new undercaliber AP projectile piercing up to 75mm at 60° from 2,000 meters. One such round has been added to a PT-76B typical ammunition load and so it can now carry 41 rounds. It was produced between 1959–1967.|$|R
5000|$|By {{pulling back}} {{slightly}} {{on the operating}} handle, the operator would then free the breech block head from the hold open device and {{under pressure from the}} operating spring the breech block mechanism would straighten, driving the breech block head forward to push the topmost cartridge forward from under the feed lips of the clip, chambering the cartridge, and engaging the extraction groove {{around the base of the}} <b>cartridge</b> with the <b>extractor.</b> The extractor and the spring-loaded plunger type ejector were both built into breech block head. If the rifle was not immediately to be fired, the spring-loaded striker assembly (housed within the breech block head and body) could be locked by pushing the cross-bolt safety located in the breech body from right to left; this would also lock the breech block mechanism so that it could not be opened. (Army test reports identified the safety and the firing mechanism as weak areas of the T1 rifle: the safety, when applied, prevented clearing a loaded chamber and did not lock the trigger mechanism; the safety was also subject to damage. The striker was reported to have become stuck on some occasions, causing slam-fires).|$|R
