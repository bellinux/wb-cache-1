40|$|An {{important}} consideration for multi-channel grocery retailers is which promotion strategy to adopt across channels. The tendency of grocery buyers to keep visiting the offline store after {{they start to}} buy at the chain’s online store, implies that promotions in one channel can have substantial negative effects on buying behavior in the other channel, especially if the promotions differ across channels. This article examines the cross-channel effects of price promotions on category purchase decisions, taking into account both contemporaneous effects (during the promotion period) and <b>cross-period</b> effects (after the promotion period). For <b>cross-period</b> promotion effects, a distinction is made between lagged promotion effects on subsequent category purchases, and promotion frequency effects on future promotion effectiveness. The results show that (1) promotions in one channel can have negative effects on category purchases in the other channel during the promotion period, (2) these cross-channel effects are asymmetric, (3) high promotion frequency can have negative effects on future promotion effectiveness in the other channel, and (4) cross-channel effects are more negative for more loyal customers of the chain. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Sales {{promotions}} generate substantial short-term sales increases. To {{determine whether}} the sales promotion bump is truly beneficial from a managerial perspective, we propose a system of store-level regression models that decomposes the sales promotion bump into three parts: cross-brand effects (secondary demand), cross period effects (primary demand borrowed from other time periods), and category-expansion effects (remaining primary demand). Across four store-level scanner datasets, we find {{that each of these}} three parts contribute about one third on average. One extension we propose is the separation of the category-expansion effect into cross-store and market-expansion effects. Another one is to split the cross-item effect (total across all other items) into cannibalization and between-brand effects. We also allow for a flexible decomposition by allowing all effects to depend on the feature/display support condition and on the magnitude of the price discount. The latter dependence is achieved by local polynomial regression. We find that feature-supported price discounts are strongly associated with <b>cross-period</b> effects while display-only supported price discounts have especially strong category-expansion effects. While the role of the category-expansion effect tends to increase with higher price discounts, the roles of cross-brand and <b>cross-period</b> effects both tend to decrease...|$|E

40|$|Consumer {{promotions}} are {{an important}} element of competitive dynamics in retail markets and make {{a significant difference in the}} retailer's profits. But no study has so far included all the elements that are required to meet retail business objectives. We extend the existing literatures by considering all the basic requirements for a promotional Decision Support System (DSS) : reliance on operational (store-level) data only, the ability to predict sales as a function of prices and the inclusion of other promotional variables affecting the category. The new model delivers an optimizing promotional schedule at Stock-Keeping-Unit (SKU) level which maximizes multi-period category level profit under the constraints of business rules typically applied in practice. We first develop a high dimensional distributed lag demand model which integrates both cross-SKU competitive promotion information and <b>cross-period</b> promotional influences. We estimate the model by proposing a two stage sign constrained regularization approach to ensure realistic promotional parameters. Based on the demand model, we then build a nonlinear integer programming model to maximize the retailer's category profits over a planning horizon under constraints that model important business rules. The output of the model provides optimized prices, display and feature advertising planning together with sales and profit forecasts. Empirical tests over a number of stores and categories using supermarket data suggest that our model generates accurate sales forecasts and increases category profits by approximately 17 % and that including cross-item and <b>cross-period</b> effects is also valuable...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{consider}} the future of Victorian literary studies within the long nineteenth century, we must {{go back to that}} earlier “period” of the nineteenth century, and the French Revolution of 1789. Drawing on the aesthetic and political innovations of 1790 s women's writings, this essay argues that we need to reconceive of nineteenth-century literary studies beyond the period boundaries of Romantic and Victorian. The sexualization of revolutionary Terror, and particularly of Robespierre, in Romantic-era writings by women like Helen Maria Williams, Mary Robinson and Fanny Burney, offers surprising precedents for the feminization of Terror associated with the retrospectives of Victorian writers like Carlyle and Dickens. In this respect, and given many other aesthetic continuities (for example, the crossgender and <b>cross-period</b> appeal of the “poetess” figure), the “Victorian period” appears increasingly unsatisfactory when compared to the merits of a long nineteenth-century model for literary studies...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, as {{competition}} among international ports has intensified, the impartial and objective evaluation of port operational efficiency {{has become increasingly}} important in enabling each individual port to understand its peculiar strengths and weaknesses, {{as well as any}} immediate threats or opportunities that may affect its competitive environment.

The empirical results show that different model will lead to different result. On average, the efficiency estimated by 3 -stage DEA procedure is the highest, while CCR efficiency is the lowest. It {{should be noted that the}} efficiencies based on CCR and BCC model are somewhat lower than the 3 -stage DEA approaches, because they do not take the environmental factors, managerial inefficiency and statistical noises into account. ...|$|E

Drawing upon the framework of Gibbons and Murphy (1992), we restructure the performance of fund manager with emphasis on the multiplicative effect of previous effort on the latter period, and derive the positive <b>cross-period</b> linkage of fund manager’s efforts. In particular, our study derives that a greater first-period’s effort by the fund manager will induce more second-period effort and greater compensation in either fixed or variable (performance-related) portion of the payment. Though the total performance related pay might increase {{as the result of}} greater effort in the previous period, we show that the pay-performance sensitivity in the second period will decline. Moreover, the initial wealth increase will motivate the fund manager to exert more effort and induce better performance, but decrease the pay-performance sensitivity in the second period.

40|$|How {{should we}} {{understand}} Victorian cultural conflict? The Victorians were fiercely disputatious, divided between multiple {{views of the}} political, religious and social issues that motivated their changing aspirations. Such debates are a fundamental aspect of the literary culture of the period, and the essays in this collection propose new ways of understanding their significance. Ranging from detailed readings of key literary figures (Browning, Collins, Dickens, Eliot) to explorations of <b>cross-period</b> themes (the philosophical roots of conflict; dreams and psychology; consumption; imperialism and race) or specific literary movements or moments (Chartism; journalism; writing of the Afghan War; New Woman novels), they address diverse areas of intellectual inquiry about what mattered most to the Victorians. These essays speak collectively in arguing for a reinterpretation of literary and cultural conflict through a greater critical awareness of the productive analyses available within such debates over difference in the period. The aim is not to resolve conflicted cultural moments or movements, but to explore the slippages and instabilities which so fascinated, intrigued and inspired the Victorians themselves...|$|E
40|$|Given {{the large}} {{uncertainties}} regarding potential damages from {{climate change and}} the significant but also uncertain costs of reducing greenhouse emissions, the debate over a policy response is often framed as a choice of acting now or waiting until the uncertainty is reduced. Implicit in the "wait to learn" argument {{is the notion that}} the ability to learn in the future necessarily implies that less restrictive policies should be chosen in the near term. I demonstrate in the general case that the ability to learn in the future can lead to either less restrictive or more restrictive policies today. I also show that the initial decision made under uncertainty will be affected by future learning only if the actions taken today change the marginal costs or marginal damages in the future. Results from an intermediate-scale integrated model of climate and economics indicate that the choice of current emissions restrictions is independent of whether or not uncertainty is resolved before future decisions, because, like most models, the <b>cross-period</b> interactions are minimal. With stronger interactions, the effect of learning on initial period decisions can be more important. ...|$|E
40|$|We examine {{decision-making}} under {{risk and}} uncertainty in a laboratory experiment. The heart of our design examines how one’s propensity to use Bayes’ rule is affected by whether this rule is aligned with reinforcement or clashes with it. In some cases, we create environments where Bayesian updating after a successful outcome should lead a decision-maker to make a change, while no change should be made after observing an unsuccessful outcome. We observe striking patterns: When payoff reinforcement and Bayesian updating are aligned, nearly all people respond as expected. However, when these forces clash, around 50 % of all decisions are inconsistent with Bayesian updating. While people tend to make costly initial choices that eliminate complexity in a subsequent decision, we find that complexity alone cannot explain our results. Finally, when a draw provides only information (and no payment), switching errors occur much less frequently, suggesting that the ‘emotional reinforcement’ (affect) induced by payments is {{a critical factor in}} deviations from Bayesian updating. There is considerable behavioral heterogeneity; we identify different types in the population and find that people who make ‘switching errors’ {{are more likely to have}} <b>cross-period</b> ‘reinforcement’ tendencies...|$|E
40|$|Quite a few {{texts from}} England were {{translated}} into Irish {{in the fifteenth}} and early-sixteenth centuries. The number of these texts was significant enough to suggest that foreign material of this sort enjoyed something of a vogue in late-medieval Ireland. Translated texts include Mandeville’s Travels, Guy of Warwick, Bevis of Hampton, Fierabras and a selection of saints’ lives. Scholars have {{paid little attention to}} the origins and initial readerships of these texts, but still less research has been conducted into their afterlife in early modern Ireland. However, a strikingly high number of these works continued to be read and copied well into the seventeenth century and some, such as the Irish translations of Octavian and William of Palerne, only survive in manuscripts from this later period. This paper takes these translations as a test case to explore the ways in which a <b>cross-period</b> approach to such writing is applicable in Ireland, a country where the renaissance is generally considered to have taken little hold. It considers the extent to which Irish reception of this translated material shifts and evolves {{in the course of this}} turbulent period and whether the same factors that contributed to the continued demand for a range of similar texts in England into the seventeenth century are also discernible in the Irish context...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{developments}} in humanistic geography, philosophy, and archaeology {{to develop a}} long-term place-centered theoretical perspective on monuments of the Roman Empire. The emphasis is on theory-building and {{an exploration of the}} implications of applying the proposed perspective, rather than a detailed case study of a particular Roman monument. It is argued that monuments and heritage sites are too frequently viewed as time capsules for which perceived significance derives from their original function and period of construction and primary use: the glory days effectively define the monument and set the parameters of present-day management, public presentation, and research agendas. Sites and monuments are often pigeon-holed, branded, and carefully circumscribed by chronological and thematic parameters that allow for simple and digestable messaging, but this practice establishes and reinforces a reductionist perspective in which only certain periods and functions are seen to really matter. The paper merges place theory and genealogy to propose and explore an alternative perspective that allows for the continued celebration of key episodes in a site’s life, but that also allows for the explicit recognition that significance is cumulative and changing, and that a wider range of activities, events, memories, and stories augment and enrich traditional period-limited views; such a perspective also provides opportunities for new research and cross-disciplinary and <b>cross-period</b> collaboration...|$|E
30|$|Without {{knowing the}} exact utility {{functions}} of customers, modelling customers’ responses to time-varying prices becomes important. Schweppe et al. [20] developed {{the concept of}} spot pricing of electricity where they envisaged a system wherein the spot prices change in real time, and customers can adjust their demand depending on the spot prices. Three responsive load models, namely, linear, exponential and potential demand functions are proposed. [21] indicated that the assumption that customers can reduce their loads indefinitely is unrealistic; instead, customers will attempt to shift their consumption to other periods. Therefore, {{the concept of the}} price-elasticity of demand is important for modelling responses. The influence of demand elasticity on the shape of the load curve has been addressed in the past works including the concepts of self-elasticity (the relation between demand and price in one time interval) and cross-elasticity (the relation between demand and price in different time intervals) [22, 23, 24, 25]. For instance, in [22], demand models were formulated as linear models, and the matrix of elasticities which includes all self-elasticities and cross-elasticities was evaluated. A demand responsive model was proposed in [23] based on price self-elasticity, which consists of four different demand functions, namely, linear, exponential, logarithmic and potential functions. An economic model for the demand response which can explain the change and <b>cross-period</b> shift in consumption pattern of customers is proposed in [25]. However, the above price elasticity based demand models are not ready for use in the pricing optimization problem. This is mainly {{due to the lack of}} market behavior constraints between the elasticities, which can lead to incorrect demand modelling where higher market prices lead to higher usages. Motivated by the above analysis, in this paper, we adopt a realistic demand model based on price elasticity including relevant market behavior constraints to be use in the pricing optimization model.|$|E
40|$|Discussion Paper 13 / 2003 The present paper {{examines}} new {{estimates of}} GDP {{for the five}} Nordic countries 1830 - 1910 {{in terms of economic}} growth and purchasing power parities. It concludes that significant economic growth took place during the period. The long-run growth was surprisingly even. However, up to the 1870 s this growth was strongest in Norway. From then on Sweden had fastest growth, when Norway experienced relative decline. PPP calculations of GDPs show that Denmark was best off of Nordic countries in the entire period. Norway was number two {{to the end of the}} nineteenth century, and then over taken by Sweden in the early 1900 s. Finland and Iceland obtained similar levels 1870 - 1910. Historical national accounts During the last decades Scandinavian economic historians have been in the forefront in constructing historical national accounts (HNA). Olle Krantz pioneered a Nordic project in 1994. The aim was to reach at common standards for the construction and presentation of HNA for the Nordic countries. By adopting common standards one will be able to carry out both cross-country and <b>cross-period</b> comparisons. The Finnish historical national accounts, constructed by Riitta Hjerppe, in many ways served as a standard for the other Nordic countries (Hjerppe 1989). By adopting modern standards with historical alterations the standards for the Nordic Historical National Accounts (NHNA) are closely related to the United Nations System of National Accounts from 1993 (SNA 93) and the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95) established by the Commission of the European Union and Eurostat. As result of the ongoing Nordic project, new series of HNA for the Nordic countries have been published. Gudmundur Jonsson has constructed a HNA for Iceland (HNI...|$|E
40|$|This Bachelor thesis compares {{selected}} {{period and}} cohort characteristics of fertility for 15 chosen European {{countries that are}} divided into four groups: post-communist countries, Northern European countries, Southern European countries and Western European countries. The aim of this thesis {{is to find out}} whether differences among selected groups of countries exist and whether differences between post-communist countries {{and the rest of the}} countries still prevail. Additionally, the thesis aims to indicate the aggregate fertility rates achieved, the average age of mothers at birth, and, finally, the proportion of children born outside marriage in countries in question. Moreover, the development of completed fertility of women born after World War II is examined to reveal whether the decline in <b>cross-period</b> total fertility has been later compensated at least partially, or whether the total fertility rate constantly decreases. The Eurostat and the Human Fertility databases were used to acquire elementary data. The data were later analysed. According to results, the total fertility rate in all selected countries during the second half of the last century had decreased. In some cases, it had fallen even under the level necessary to ensure basic reproduction of the population. During the present century, the aggregate total fertility rates have been fairly stable; in some countries, even moderate growth can be seen. Despite the initial decline over the past decade, the mean age of women at childbirth has been increasing in most of the countries, and oscillates around the age of 30. Also, the high proportion of children born outside marriage can be seen. Currently, apart from few exceptions, the proportion of children born outside marriage ranges between 40 and 60 %. Furthermore, the research results show also that the majority of selected period and cohort characteristics examined differ a lot among the selected groups of countries. It was find out that the completed cohort fertility is decreasing with time in Southern and Northern European countries. It is assumed that the completed cohort fertility is going to increase in Western European countries for generations born after the year 1980. For post-communist countries it is assumed that the figures are going to increase for the youngest generations...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{empirical}} {{study of the}} volatility and correlations among the key commodity markets for metals and crude oils. Both conventional and state-of-the-art models will be applied, which are presented in three main chapters. First, Chapter 2 provides a thorough literature review on commodities that paves {{the way for the}} three substantive chapters. It discusses the distinctive characteristics of commodity markets, with special emphasis on gold and crude oil as potential trading options for portfolio diversification. The aim is to present the financial side {{in the form of a}} comprehensive and up-to-date survey in commodity investment for stakeholders. Second, Chapter 3 applies the widely-used conventional techniques of Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) and Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) based on the Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model for volatility in these markets, with particular attention paid to the dynamics of volatility and correlations in the crude oil and gold markets. This study analyses the weekly spot data between 1986 [M 1 :W 1] and 2016 [M 9 :W 4], with the period being further divided into four significant sub-periods, enabling <b>cross-period</b> comparison. The objective is to use the latest available data for analysis, provide an insight into portfolio diversification, and explore if the markets are of one. The findings suggest that gold can be used to diversify away from crude oil. Interestingly, palladium seems to have low and even negative correlations with other metal commodities, suggesting that palladium may be a new safe option within commodity markets. The correlations between the crude oil markets and the metal markets increased significantly in early 2000 s, and continued through financial crisis in 2008 until they peaked between 2009 / 2010. These observations could be attributed to the surge in trading interest within commodity markets. Third, Chapter 4 presents a state-of-the-art model, the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), using the same three-decade data as the previous chapter. The study begins with examining the co-movements between commodities' returns with a set of continuous wavelet tools, which consist of wavelet variance, covariance, coherency, phase-difference and gain. This is achieved by extending the estimated variables to include higher order coefficients in the time-frequency domain. The findings indicate that gold and oil exhibit low covariance and coherency. In addition, the study also uncovers a set of new stylized facts for commodities (crude oils and metals) that would not be possible to detect with pure time- or frequency-domain methods, nor with the time-frequency domain tools available thus far. While the results support the previous chapter in showing low gold-oil coherency, wavelet analysis offers exceptional level of stylised facts that were not previously available for commodity markets, i. e. frequency analysis of multiple investment horizons. Fourth, Chapter 5 builds on the CWT analysis used in the previous chapter with two major enhancements. In this study, the phase-difference circle is reconstructed into a non-technical and more simplified diagram format to facilitate result interpretation for non-experts. Also, the wavelet working tools are recalibrated so that gain values can be extracted to increase the robustness interpretations of the gain results. Moreover, both spot and future prices are used in this study to examine the Gold-to-Oil Ratio (GOR) and the gold and oil implied volatility indices from 2008 [M 6 :W 1] to 2017 [M 1 :W 1]. The gain coefficients uncovered interesting findings. For example, the gain frequency for one to four years is always greater than the gain coefficient values of the other two frequencies. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes the three substantive chapters by summarising and contrasting the findings. It also discusses possible directions for future research...|$|E
