5|$|The main (west) facade has a {{projecting}} {{two and a}} half-story {{gable roof}} section that is three bays wide and two deep. Decorative detail on the exterior includes quoins, the James Gibbs-inspired surround on the main entrance, and the molded surrounds and keystones of the <b>casement</b> windows. In {{the northwest corner of}} the intersection between the building's two sections is a one-story-high, one-bay-square addition with a narrow metal <b>casement</b> window on the west facade and a large double entrance for horses on the north. The building's interior consists of a large riding ring that is open to the rafters, and in the gable-roofed section, there are lockers and changing rooms on the first floor and a multi-purpose room on the second; on one of its walls is a floor-to-ceiling window permitting view of the ring activity below.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, King Leopold II started to receive {{criticism}} for his treatment of the natives in Congo Free State. In the United States, the main outlet of this criticism was the Presbyterian church. In 1891, Sheppard became involved with William Morrison after Lapsley's death. They would report the crimes they saw, and later, {{with the help of}} Roger <b>Casement,</b> would form the Congo Reform Association (CRA), one of the world's first humanitarian organizations.|$|E

50|$|A {{detailed}} account of <b>Casement's</b> Irish Brigade in Germany was written by Michael Keogh, recruiting officer and Sergeant Major in the Irish Brigade in Germany and <b>Casement’s</b> adjutant. The book was officially launched on 15 July 2010.|$|R
50|$|On {{the eastern}} {{elevation}} are four tall hooded windows each comprising {{two pairs of}} vertically aligned, six-pane timber framed <b>casements.</b> The west elevation is similar except the bottom pair of <b>casements</b> of the southern-most window {{have been replaced by}} a door which is accessed by a ramp.|$|R
5|$|Seven minutes later, {{two other}} high-calibre shells struck the Bretagne {{at the same}} time. The first detonated {{at the base of}} the tripod mast, igniting some {{ready-to-use}} anti-aircraft projectiles which were stored in lockers next to the anti-aircraft mounts. The second went through the central 138 mm <b>casement,</b> exploding deep inside the ship. A fire started, with leaking oil burning next to the ship. In about thirty seconds, the ship rolled and exploded.|$|E
5|$|The pool {{house was}} built in 1968 and is brick with wood-framed <b>casement</b> windows. It is a divided brick {{building}} with locker rooms on the larger west section and a refreshment area on the smaller east section. The west section has a flat roof, and the east section has a shallow hipped roof with a broad overhang. The building does {{not contribute to the}} former historic estate.|$|E
5|$|Abuses {{of power}} over the villagers by Abir had been {{reported}} by missionaries almost since they began operations in the Congo but the first real public disclosure came in 1901 {{with the publication of}} a report, written by an ex-agent, in several Belgian newspapers. The Free State began an investigation into Abir's abuses during which an inquiry established at Bongandanga heard evidence from missionaries in the concession. As a result, Abir took action against the missionaries, stopping the carriage of their mail on company steamers, stopping the missionaries' boats and confiscating any mail that they carried. Abir also forbid missionaries from buying food from villagers, forcing them to buy from Abir's own stores. In 1904 Roger <b>Casement</b> issued the <b>Casement</b> Report which condemned the Abir system; this resulted in the Free State launching another investigation later that year. Although evidence of unlawful killings made by Abir was uncovered the investigation had no powers of arrest and could only submit a report to the Free State authorities. This lack of action resulted in deteriorating relations between Abir and the missionaries and there was at least one attempted shooting of a missionary. Evidence for Abir's abuses also came from the governor of the French Congo, to the north-west, who claimed that prior to 1903 30,000 people had been driven from the Free State to the French Congo by Abir's actions.|$|E

5|$|The 33-foot {{cast iron}} spiral {{staircase}} from 1871 was repaired and restored {{for the cost}} of $15,724. The work was done by Conservation Services and they uncovered and preserved the numbering of the stairs. In October 2010, a major restoration project repainted the tower and lantern, installed ventilated steel doors, restored the original weathervane and repaired the 12-pane <b>casement</b> window on the west wall of the lighthouse. The work was completed in March 2011 after it was suspended due to poor weather in December 2010; the total cost was $121,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{sides of}} the {{original}} building are hidden by the modern extensions up {{to the level of}} the first floor. The gables are weatherboarded above the plain wall with double <b>casement</b> windows opening into the attic. The rear has a prominent late 18th century extension covered by the catslide roof. The rest of the rear of the building is a series of flat-roofed extensions. The roof is steeply pitched, tiled and half-hipped with over-hanging eaves Kent peg tiles, and weatherboarded gables. Forged brackets support the guttering.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} reports into the {{operation}} of the Free State were issued starting with the British Consul, Roger Casement's <b>Casement</b> Report and followed by reports commissioned by the Free State and Leopold II. These detailed unlawful killings and other abuses made by Abir and Leopold II was embarrassed into instituting reforms. These began with the appointment of American Richard Mohun by Leopold II as director of Abir. However, rubber exports continued to fall and rebellions increased, resulting in the Free State assuming control of the concession in 1906. Abir continued to receive a portion of profits from rubber exports and in 1911 was refounded as a rubber plantation harvesting company. The later history of the company is unknown but it was still active in 1926.|$|E

5|$|Chestnut Street is also largely residential. The 200 {{block of}} West Chestnut {{features}} old supports for the Big Four Bridge and the 100 block of West Chestnut holds the Grisamore House, which was separately {{placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1983. On East Chestnut, the 100 block contains many houses built around 1900 and the 200 block is filled with bungalows. St. Augustine Roman Catholic Church, a Spanish-flavored neo-Baroque structure with a Moorish-styled rectory, {{is located on the}} 300 block of East Chestnut. Another church is located on the 400 block including the Gothic Revival style First Presbyterian Church (with lancet windows and belltower), and a typical Works Progress Administration Art Modern school whose cruciform plan has a stuccoed facade and metal <b>casement</b> windows.|$|E
5|$|She {{was still}} {{assigned}} to the 3rd Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet in Scapa Flow {{at the start of}} World War I. On 15 December the ship was badly damaged due to severe weather in the Pentland Firth as she sortied to intercept German ships bombarding ports in Yorkshire and had to return to port for repairs. Blanche was transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron, joining her sister ship, , in January 1916. On 28 February, she was one of three cruisers dispatched to patrol off the Norwegian coast during the hunt for the German raider SMS Greif, although she did not come into contact with the German ship before she was sunk. Captain John <b>Casement</b> relieved Hyde on 21 May. During the Battle of Jutland, she was assigned to a position {{at the rear of the}} squadron during the battle and did not fire her guns. By January 1917, Blanche was detached from the Grand Fleet, presumably to be converted into a minelayer and <b>Casement</b> was relieved by Captain The Honourable Reginald Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax on 15 January. The ship had been {{assigned to the}} 5th Battle Squadron by April. Blanche laid mines at the entrance to the Kattegat on the nights of 18/19 and 24/25 February 1918, part of her total of 1,238 mines laid during 16 sorties during the war. Captain Francis Buller assumed command in lieu of Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax on 5 April 1918. He, in turn, was relieved by Captain Charles Wrightson on 7 January 1919. The ship was still assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron in February, but had been assigned to the Nore Reserve by 1 May, together with Blonde. The sisters were listed for sale by 18 March 1920 and Blanche was sold to Fryer for scrap on 27 July 1921 and broken up at Sunderland.|$|E
5|$|The building's western façade has {{a central}} {{entryway}} with double doors, {{topped by a}} six-light transom and flanked by engaged pilasters. Its gable, sheathed in aluminum siding, incorporates a gabled pediment and the building's perimeter {{is surrounded by a}} wide, flat frieze. The building's southern elevation has wooden windows with 12-over-12 double-hung sashes on brick window sills. Its basement level has one entrance, flanked by wooden double-hung sash windows and four <b>casement</b> windows. The northeastern elevation has three stained-glass windows on the main level, with three wooden eight-over-eight double-hung sash windows; a single wooden six-over-six double-hung sash window is in the gable. The building is roofed with asphalt shingles, and a brick chimney is along the slope of the northern elevation's roof line. Its northeastern elevation has five wooden 16-over-16 double-hung sash windows on the main level and four on the lower level, in addition to two wooden four-over-four sash windows.|$|E

5|$|Built of {{red brick}} with Chilmark and Portland stone dressings, {{the house has}} a compact, {{rectangular}} plan and has two main floors, plus a basement and an attic floor lit by dormer windows. On the south façade, there are eight <b>casement</b> windows {{in the basement and}} nine sash windows on each of the ground floor and first floor. The bay with the three central windows projects forwards slightly, and the central ground floor window is pedimented. The lead-covered hipped roof has a central flat section, surrounded by a balustrade with a cupola rising from its centre. The dormer windows are in a central, balustraded terrace of three, with an outlying window on either side. The house is entered from the north through a later mid-19th-century porte-cochère, while to the south there is a stone-flagged terrace with balustrade extending the full width of the building, and broad shallow steps leading down to the lawns. The east façade has a triple-arched loggia with access to the garden, while to the west there is access to the later 18th-century laundry and kitchen garden.|$|E
5|$|The German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg {{authorised}} German activity against British India as World War I {{broke out}} in September 1914. Germany decided to actively support the Ghadarite plans. Using the links established between Indian and Irish residents in Germany (including Irish nationalist and poet Roger <b>Casement)</b> and the German Foreign Office, Oppenheim tapped into the Indo-Irish network in the United States. Har Dayal had helped organise the Ghadar party before his arrest in the United States in 1914. He however jumped bail {{and made his way}} to Switzerland, leaving the party and publications in the charge of Ram Chandra Bharadwaj, who became the Ghadar president in 1914. The German consulate in San Francisco was tasked to make contact with Ghadar leaders in California. A naval lieutenant by the name of Wilhelm von Brincken {{with the help of the}} Indian nationalist journalist Tarak Nath Das and an intermediary by the name of Charles Lattendorf established links with Bharadwaj. Meanwhile, in Switzerland the Berlin committee was able to convince Har Dayal that organising a revolution in India was feasible.|$|E
5|$|The squash {{house was}} {{constructed}} around 1920, completed in 1931, and was demolished between 2011 and 2013. It was {{located near the}} Logan Riding Ring, on the club's south entrance road. It was two stories high, five bays wide and nine bays deep, and was stucco-covered with a flat roof. There were two entrances on the main (south) facade, one at ground level and another on the balcony. The entrances had double wooden doors, paneled below and glazed above. All of the building's windows consisted of wood-framed, paired <b>casement</b> windows with brick sills. A veranda with Tuscan piers extended {{the length of the}} main facade, interrupted by a two-bay-wide, one-bay-deep projection east of the main entrance. The building's interior contained a doubles court, two singles courts, a reception room, locker rooms, showers, and a spectators' gallery seating 150. Across the road from where the building stood is an outdoor riding ring enclosed by a rough rail fence. To the west of the building's site, standing alone in the tall grass, is a 16th-century post-and-lintel stone element, which {{was at the center of}} the stage of a 1,500-seat outdoor Greek amphitheater that was part of the Shepard estate and was since dismantled.|$|E

5|$|First passing {{just south}} of Ireland on August25, the storm dropped heavy {{rainfall}} and brought strong winds, significantly affecting the coastline where winds of 65mph (105km/h) were reported. Rainfall spread across the entire country, peaking at 11.0in (280mm) in Kippure. There, a station reported more than 7.8in (200mm) in 24hours, which set {{the record for the}} greatest daily rainfall total in the country. Several 24-hour rainfall records were set during the storm, and new six-hour and twelve-hour record totals at <b>Casement</b> Aerodrome were set with 1.63in (41.5mm) and 2.61in (66.2mm), respectively. The rainfall left some areas flooded, particularly in the Dublin area where 451buildings were inundated, some up to a depth of 8ft (2.4m). Preliminarily, it was described as the worst flooding in the history of Dublin. Two small rivers, the Dodder and the Dargle, overflowed their banks due to the rainfall. The River Dargle overflowed in Bray, flooding some areas up to a depth of 5ft (1.5m) and forcing about 1,000people to evacuate; several special-needs people were evacuated by boat. The flood, which originated about one mile north of the town, damaged over 500houses and brought down several trees. Despite local politicians promising for flood protection after the flood, the town remained vulnerable to such flooding at least 20years after the storm. The River Dodder, which also overflowed, nearly exceeded the reservoir dam in Bohernabreena in South Dublin. Additional spillways were later added in the event of another similar flood. In the Wicklow Mountains, the rainfall resulted in significant runoff, which caused erosion along the Cloghoge River. The passage of the storm left heavy crop damage, part of a larger period of poor agriculture in the country. Throughout the country, the storm caused at least thirteen deaths, four of which were drownings in flooded rivers; one death was caused by a heart attack while being evacuated from flooding. Two months after the storm struck, the government of Ireland allocated IR£6,449,000 (1986IEP, $8,650,000 1986USD) to repair roads and bridges damaged by the weather system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Casement</b> unsuccessfully appealed {{against his}} {{conviction}} and death sentence. Those who pleaded for clemency for <b>Casement</b> included Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was acquainted with <b>Casement</b> {{through the work}} of the Congo Reform Association, poet W. B. Yeats, and playwright George Bernard Shaw. Joseph Conrad could not forgive <b>Casement,</b> nor could Casement's longtime friend, the sculptor Herbert Ward, whose son Charles had been killed on the Western Front that January, and who would change the name of Casement's godson, who had been named after him. Members of the <b>Casement</b> family in Antrim contributed discreetly to the defence fund, although they had sons in the British Army and Navy. A United States Senate appeal against the death sentence was rejected by the British cabinet on the insistence of prosecutor F.E. Smith, an opponent of Irish independence.|$|E
25|$|In 1903 the British House of Commons {{passed a}} {{resolution}} on the Congo. Subsequently, the British consul in the Congo, Roger <b>Casement,</b> was sent up country for an investigation.

Morel was introduced to <b>Casement</b> by their mutual friend Herbert Ward just before {{the publication of the}} report and realised that in <b>Casement</b> he had found the ally he had sought. <b>Casement</b> convinced Morel to establish an organisation for dealing specifically with the Congo question, the Congo Reform Association.
