Two case studies illustrate forces shaping programming.

The second study investigate~ peace and conflict impact assessments. Current methodologies have difficulty demonstrating program impacts.

40|$|It {{has been}} found in the study that {{potential}} conflicts are natural for public sector projects. Among the factors, that predetermine it, one can distinguish the following: the opposite to the processes of making changes; competition of participants during the allocation of project resources; different opportunities to access the project product; insufficient consideration of interested parties’ interests; context conflicts; directing the project to resolve the conflict in the territory; unsuccessful selection of the project team. Consequently, the article deals with the issues related to the definition of the peculiarities of the «conflict sensitivity» implementation mechanisms in the public sector projects. This topic has not been studied thoroughly in the specialized publications on public administration in Ukraine. Definitions of main related categories of the «conflict sensitivity» domain based on Conflict Sensitivity Consortium guidelines have been described in the study: «conflict sensitivity», «conflict», «conflict analysis», «conflict sensitivity analysis». The main ideas on the peculiarities of <b>conflict-sensitive</b> project / program management implementation mechanisms in the context of ensuring the success of local development projects by the integration of «conflict sensitivity» into all three phases of the project cycle, under which the intervention is implemented, are as follows: <b>conflict-sensitive</b> planning; <b>conflict-sensitive</b> implementation; <b>conflict-sensitive</b> monitoring and evaluation. The example of the <b>conflict-sensitive</b> project management use is: EUNPACK international project «Good intentions, mixed results – A conflict sensitive understanding of the EU comprehensive approach to conflict and crisis mechanisms», which aims to develop recommendations on the improvement of the EU crises response mechanisms by the increase of their sensitivity to conflict and context. As a result, prospects for further research have been defined. As the mechanisms of implementation of the «conflict sensitivity» in public sector projects have been poorly researched in Ukraine and taking into account the significant level of conflict in the environment, where local development projects are implemented, the need for further scientific research in this subject area has been proven. In particular, the scientific substantiation of the mechanisms of Ukrainian local development projects’ managers and teams competence improvement has been described in the sphere of <b>conflict-sensitive</b> project / program management’s implementation...|$|E

In this paper, we exploit variation in rainfall during the growing season, to study how resource inequality between ethnic groups affects the risks of violent conflicts in Nigeria. Our main results show that a one standard deviation change in between-group rainfall inequality during the growing season increases civil conflicts prevalence in Nigeria by about seven percentage points. This relationship is driven, in part, by declining social capital. Specifically, we demonstrated that an unequal distribution of rainfall between ethnic groups reinforces citizens grievances over government performance and creates mistrust between predominantly farming communities and those engaged in nomadic herding.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} shows that negative emotional stimuli speed up the resolution of conflict between opposing response tendencies.

We therefore presented positive emotional words in a version of the flanker conflict task, in which conflict is elicited by incongruent target and flanker stimuli. Response times to incongruent stimuli were shortened in positive words, indicating a speeding up of conflict resolution. We also observed an enlargement of the first <b>conflict-sensitive</b> event-related potential (ERP) of the electroencephalogram, the N 200, in positive emotional trials. The data suggest that positive emotion already modulates first stages of conflict processing. The results demonstrate that positive, reward-predicting stimuli influence conflict processing in a similar manner to threat signals. Positive emotion thus reduces the time that an organism is unable to respond due to simultaneously present conflicting action tendencies...|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that microfinance has become a key tool to reduce poverty in developing countries. Previously unable {{to gain access to}} credit and savings products from formal providers such as banks, poor people can now take small loans to support income-generating activities, or build up small savings accounts for important expenditures. These services are offered by microfinance providers (MFPs), semi-formal institutions which often have development as well as financial goals. Because poverty tends to be widespread in countries emerging from war, the provision of microfinance is being increasingly recognised as crucial to post-conflict economic reconstruction. Most writers on post-conflict microfinance (PCM) have outlined the considerable challenges which MFPs face in these unstable situations, and have offered valuable operational advice on how to meet those challenges. However, little has been written on how PCM has impacted upon the clients themselves, or whether it has assisted them to re-establish viable livelihoods. Secondly, even though postwar situations are unstable due to unresolved sources of tension, most PCM literature lacks a systematic treatment of how the microfinance could be 'conflict-sensitive'. 'Conflict sensitivity' can be defined as taking preventative measures to reduce the possibility that development intervention will exacerbate tensions, and implementing pro-active strategies to help build peace. This study constructs a conflict sensitive system whereby microfinance goes beyond its traditional role of poverty alleviation to that of conflict mitigation. Afghanistan serves as context within which the concepts of <b>conflict-sensitive</b> microfinance are explored. Since the defeat of the Taliban in 2001, much of Afghanistan has enjoyed a period of relative peace and reconstruction after 22 years of intrastate war. However, the country still faces a number of challenges which could contribute to renewed violence, including poverty, inter-ethnic tensions, weak local governance, and the largest opium sector in the world. This study examines what role the young microfinance sector is playing in addressing these issues and what impact it is having on Afhgan livelihoods and society. The sector's success in helping to alleviate poverty and build peace depends {{on the extent to which}} MFPs in Afghanistan expand their services, coordinate efforts among themselves, and collaborate with other development and government actors in holistic, <b>conflict-sensitive</b> interventions...|$|E

It covers post-conflict transitions where external authorities play a major role. A core contemporary peacebuilding policy assumption is that stimulating economic recovery is vital to sustaining political settlements and social cohesion. Yet how do we respond when policies to stimulate investment and imperatives to consolidate peace lead to contradictory choices? The paper considers framing investment-promotion activities as quasi-regulatory in nature, given that external actors are shaping and influencing private sector impacts on peacebuilding. It reflects on ideas of "transitionalism" as a distinctive policy mindset during exceptional recovery periods. It addresses three questions: (1) what is distinctive about transitional approaches to influencing the ways that business actors may impact peacebuilding (compared with "routine" developmental settings) ? (2) What is distinctive about promoting <b>conflict-sensitive</b> business activity and investment, and how might this require different priorities? (3) What is the proper balance in transitional policymaking between attracting investment to capital-starved settings, and requiring investment to be responsible? (author's abstract...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} for conflict is omnipresent in all projects, {{and even in}} all human interactions, and conflict itself leads to many second-order social impacts. This article examines {{the contribution of the}} methodological approach used in social impact assessment (SIA) to conflict management. We view conflict as a process that has its own dynamic, and is to be expected in all situations. By using game theory (prisoner's dilemma), we describe and conceptualize this process and highlight the importance of communication in managing conflict. We demonstrate the potential use of SIA in preventing, managing and resolving conflict. Emphasis is placed on the participatory character of SIA and the role of public media. In contrast to existing literature, our focus is not restricted to the typical fields of study of SIA (e. g. environmental conflicts), but understands conflict itself as a field of application. In this sense, <b>conflict-sensitive</b> SEA can be understood both as an extension to the SEA tool kit and a broadening of the scope of SIA application. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Natural {{resources}} {{played a}} central role in the protracted violent conflict in Liberia. A durable peace building and post-conflict reconstruction process, therefore, requires attention for <b>conflict-sensitive</b> natural resource management. The EU-funded Across the River Transboundary Peace Park for Sierra Leone and Liberia (ARTP) was initiated to make peace building and sustainable natural resource management two mutually reinforcing efforts by establishing national parks in the Gola Forest area alongside development projects to enhance local living conditions. Whereas significant progress can be observed in Sierra Leone, limited headway has been made in the Liberian Gola Forest where ARTP-related activities are obstructed by hostile attitudes among local communities. Local communities feel that they are structurally inhibited from exercising legitimate and effective command over the entitlement sets needed to safeguard their livelihoods and well-being, i. e. their human security. The conflict potential stemming from these feelings of relative deprivation is further enhanced by the current plans for the establishment of a national park in the Liberian Gola Forest. Inclusive community consultations must be facilitated to establish a clearer understanding of local differential vulnerability that needs to be addressed, and to increase the communities’ willingness to actively participate in the process of designing feasible and sustainable natural resource management strategies that will strengthen rather than hamper peace building. ...|$|E

It is produced through tropes of nationalism rooted in economic marginalization, loss of territory and anxieties about invasions of home. Such anxieties give rise to the secr,rri-tizatimt of fear used to underwrite the allocation of resources to fortify borders and manage risk. The securitization of fear and its geopolitical uses and abuses in the context of disaster, conflict, and human displacement demand further attention. This article examines two expressions of fear that have signiffcant implications for broader research agendas in political geography. First, in post-tsunami Sri Lanka, the implementation of "buffer zones, " or no-build setback areas along the affected coastlines after the tsunami vividly illustrates how efforts to enhance public safety can stir Gelings of discrimination, terxion, and fear. Humanitarian remedies that are not cautiously <b>conflict-sensitive</b> can unwittingly generate fear and mistrust. Second, the politics of fear intersect with the provision of intemational aid, which is increasingly premised on vulnerabiliry "at home " in donor countries to make it politically relevant.

Amidst deeply imbedded social trauma and residual distrust, public participation during Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) can provide a space for high-risk and marginalised stakeholders to renegotiate their post-war identities. In rural and peri-urban Liberia women, ex-combatants and youth are increasingly taking ownership of their communities ’ socio-economic development. Through participatory processes, they are being invited to provide input into the design of development projects; an opportunity that has been historically reserved to an elite group of stakeholders such as town chiefs; local authorities; and international actors such as multinational companies, the United Nations, and NGOs. Today, more than a decade after the country’s civil war has ended, Liberia’s high natural resource endowment has the immense potential to serve as a blessing, not a curse. Used correctly, public participation can serve not only as an unintended peace brokering tool that rebuilds the social fabric of conflict-affected communities, but also as a building block for a stronger and more informed set of stakeholders who are prepared to exercise their decision-making agency. As such, <b>conflict-sensitive</b> and gender-sensitive public participation serves as a tool that can provide a real opportunity for war-affected communities to maximize the social benefit they can yield from development projects.

While researchers have made important advances in recent years in assessing the role of environmental resources as a causal factor in civil conflict, analysis of the positive potential of collective natural resource management efforts to reduce broader conflict is less developed. In particular, {{there is a need for}} analytical tools that not only describe stakeholder interactions and outcomes but also yield practical guidance on what development practitioners and policy makers can do to promote such goals. Addressing this need, we present a framework focused on the links between collective action, conflict prevention, and social-ecological resilience. Building on the institutional analysis and development (IAD) model, and incorporating principles from the sustainable livelihoods approach and resilience theory, the framework is applicable across multiple scales of analysis, linking local stakeholder dynamics to the broader institutional and governance context.

40|$|Given that {{conditional}} cash transfers (CCTs) {{can be a}} {{very effective}} social welfare program to reduce poverty and improve education and health outcomes, but may exacerbate conflict, this thesis addresses strategies for <b>conflict-sensitive</b> formulation and implementation of CCTs in Indonesia. This thesis raises the immediate need to address poverty in Indonesia and seeks to learn from the successes and challenges of other CCTs, such as those enacted in Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, and the Philippines. This thesis also looks into existing literature comparing the effectiveness of CCTs to other social protection programs (SPPs) and finds that CCT {{is one of the most}} effective (SPPs). Moreover, this thesis also explores the reasoning and conditioning factors as to how CCTs may reduce or exacerbate conflict, and finds that it can reduce conflict through the education channel (e. g. positive peer effect, reduction of time to spend doing other activities), employment channel (e. g. education leading to higher chances of getting employed), and the income substitution channel (cash benefits received would reduce incentives to engage in financially-motivated crimes). Nonetheless, this thesis also seeks to enhance the targeting mechanisms of CCTs to ensure that it does not exacerbate conflict. More specifically, this thesis concludes that Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH), the CCT program in Indonesia, should employ a more centralized targeting to reduce opportunities for local elite capture in its 7, 000 districts. Furthermore, this thesis proposes the creation of a more competitive system in electing which districts it works with by asking district heads to submit proposals outlining why and how PKH will work in their respective areas, which will hopefully motivate them to be more accountable and to reduce administrative costs...|$|E

There are 864. 72 million mobile subscribers (Annual Report 2012 - 13) and thus the mobile telecommunications system in India is the second largest in the world. Over 18 million mobile connections are being added every month. The field of journalism is no exception to the trend as mobile phone has become an essential tool for working journalists in news reporting. By using the mobile phones one can gather and disseminate {{the information in the}} form of text (SMS), audio or video (MMS), or sometimes a combination of all these. An OB Van besides being expensive, it needs a crew of at least two and may amounts to spend a few thousands rupees for its operations. With software like Qik and a connected mobile phone, Journalists can broadcast live video within seconds by logging-in the programs on their phone. Even news feed in the form of footage and photos of major incidents- 9 / 11 WTO attack, Tsunami in 2004, Bombing of Taj Hotels in India’s financial capital- which were captured by the eye witness in their mobiles were largely used by the news organizations. A more recent mobile phone technology known as 3 G, for ―third generation, ‖ enables multi-media on mobile phones plus fast connections and audio-video options. This article analyses how the mobile phone is used for news gathering, whether it is useful in <b>conflict-sensitive</b> reporting, whether it can be useful in recording exclusive visuals in investigating reporting. Also, this paper investigates whether mobile phones have improved the working conditions for journalists...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{conflict}} potential of climate variability {{is critical for}} assessing {{and dealing with the}} societal implications of climate change. Yet, it remains poorly understood under what circumstances – and how – extreme weather events and variation in precipitation patterns affect organized violence. This dissertation suggests that the impacts of climate variability on organized violence are conditional on specific climate patterns, the sensitivity of livelihoods, and state governance. These theoretical conjectures are subjected to novel empirical tests in four individual essays. Three essays investigate the relationship between climate variability and communal and civil conflict through sub-national quantitative analysis focusing on Sub-Saharan Africa. The fourth essay sheds light on causal mechanisms leading to participation in land-related conflict based on interview material on 75 ex-participants in violence from Mt. Elgon, Kenya. Essay I suggests that the exposure of vulnerable agricultural livelihoods to sustained drought increases the risk of civil conflict violence. Essay II indicates that rainfall anomalies increase the risk of communal violence, an effect which is amplified by political marginalization. Essay III finds support for the proposition that volatility in resource supply increases the risk of communal conflict over land and water in remote regions, which tend to have limited state presence. Essay IV proposes that individuals depending on agriculture are prone to participate in land-related conflict as they face impediments to leaving a conflict zone, and additionally have high incentives to partake in fighting for land. Taken together, the dissertation furthers our understanding of the specific economic and political context under which climate variability impacts armed conflict. This knowledge is important for <b>conflict-sensitive</b> adaptation to climate change and conflict prevention efforts...|$|E
