25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens (updated {{scientific}} name Rhizobium radiobacter, synonym Agrobacterium radiobacter) is the causal agent of <b>crown</b> <b>gall</b> <b>disease</b> (the formation of tumours) in over 140 species of eudicots.

Symptoms {{are caused by}} the insertion of a small segment of DNA (known as the T-DNA, for 'transfer DNA', {{not to be confused}} with tRNA that transfers amino acids during protein synthesis, confusingly also called transfer RNA), from a plasmid, into the plant cell, which is incorporated at a semi-random location into the plant genome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Crown</b> <b>gall</b> <b>disease</b> {{caused by}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be {{controlled}} via {{a variety of different}} methods. The best means of control for this disease is by taking preventative measures, such as sterilizing pruning tools if these tools are used on infected trees and shrubs, performing mandatory inspections of nursery stock and rejecting infected plants as well as not planting susceptible plants in infected fields. Another useful practice is to avoid wounding the crowns/roots of the plants during cultivation, such as budding and not grafting plants, since wounds are the main means of bacterial entry. Control of root-chewing insects is also helpful to reduce levels of infection. It is recommended that infected plant material be burned rather than placed in a compost pile due to the bacteria's ability to live in the soil for many years.|$|E

40|$|Agrobacterium {{species are}} soilborne gram-negative {{bacteria}} exhibiting predominantly a saprophytic lifestyle. Only {{a few of}} these species are capable of parasitic growth on plants, causing either hairy root or <b>crown</b> <b>gall</b> <b>diseases.</b> The core of the infection strategy of pathogenic Agrobacteria is a genetic transformation of the host cell, via stable integration into the host genome of a DNA fragment called T-DNA. This genetic transformation results in oncogenic reprogramming of the host to the benefit of the pathogen. This unique ability of interkingdom DNA transfer was largely used as a tool for genetic engineering. Thus, the artificial host range of Agrobacterium is continuously expanding and includes plant and nonplant organisms. The increasing availability of genomic tools encouraged genome-wide surveys of T-DNA tagged libraries, and the pattern of T-DNA integration in eukaryotic genomes was studied. Therefore, data have been collected in numerous laboratories to attain a better understanding of T-DNA integration mechanisms and potential biases. This review focuses on the intranuclear mechanisms necessary for proper targeting and stable expression of Agrobacterium oncogenic T-DNA in the host cell. More specifically, the role of genome features and the putative involvement of host's transcriptional machinery in relation to the T-DNA integration and effects on gene expression are discussed. Also, the mechanisms underlying T-DNA integration into specific genome compartments is reviewed, and a theoretical model for T-DNA intranuclear targeting is presented...|$|R
40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the causative {{agent of}} <b>crown</b> <b>gall,</b> a <b>disease</b> of {{dicotyledonous}} plants {{characterized by a}} tumorous phenotype. Earlier in this century, scientific interest in A. tumefaciens {{was based on the}} possibility that the study of plant tumors might reveal mechanisms that were also operating in animal neoplasia. In the recent past, the tumorous growth was shown to result from the expression of genes coded for by a DNA segment of bacterial origin that was transferred and became stably integrated into the plant genome. This initial molecular characterization of the infection process suggested that Agrobacterium might be used to deliver genetic material into plants. The potential to genetically engineer plants generated renewed interest in the study of A. tumefaciens. In this review, we concentrate on the most recent advances in the study of Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer, its relationship to conjugation, DNA processing and transport, and nuclear targeting.

40|$|The VirA/VirG two-component {{regulatory}} system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens regulates {{expression of the}} virulence (vir) genes that control the infection process leading to <b>crown</b> <b>gall</b> tumor <b>disease</b> on susceptible plants. VirA, a membrane-bound homodimer, initiates vir gene induction by communicating the presence of molecular signals found {{at the site of}} a plant wound through phosphorylation of VirG. Inducing signals include phenols, monosaccharides, and acidic pH. While sugars are not essential for gene induction, their presence greatly increases vir gene expression when levels of the essential phenolic signal are low. Reception of the sugar signal depends on a direct interaction between ChvE, a sugar-binding protein, and VirA. Here we show that the sugar signal received in the periplasmic region of one subunit within a VirA heterodimer can enhance the kinase function of the second subunit. However, sugar enhancement of vir gene expression was vector dependent. virA alleles expressed from pSa-derived vectors inhibited signal transduction by endogenous VirA. Inhibition was conditional, depending on the induction medium and the virA allele tested. Moreover, constitutive expression of virG overcame the inhibitory effect of some but not all virA alleles, suggesting that there may be more than one inhibitory mechanism...|$|R

5000|$|Apricots are {{susceptible}} to various diseases whose relative importance is different in the major production regions {{as a consequence of}} their climatic differences. For example, hot weather as experienced in California's Central Valley will often cause pit burn, a condition of soft and brown fruit around the pit. Bacterial diseases include bacterial spot and <b>crown</b> <b>gall.</b> Fungal <b>diseases</b> include brown rot caused by Monilinia fructicola: infection of the blossom by rainfall leads to [...] "blossom wilt" [...] whereby the blossoms and young shoots turn brown and die; the twigs die back in a severe attack; brown rot of the fruit is due to Monilinia infection later in the season. Dieback of branches in the summer is attributed to the fungus Eutypa lata, where examination of the base of the dead branch will reveal a canker surrounding a pruning wound. Other fungal diseases are black knot, Alternaria spot and fruit rot, and powdery mildew. Unlike peaches, apricots are not affected by leaf curl, and bacterial canker (causing sunken patches in the bark which then spread and kill the affected branch or tree) and silver leaf are not serious threats, which means that pruning in late winter is considered safe.|$|R
40|$|Cells {{of higher}} plant species in culture {{sometimes}} lose their requirement for an exogenous supply {{of a cell}} division factor that, thereafter, {{they are able to}} produce. This heritable change, known as cytokinin habituation, appears to be an epigenetic one rather than a classical mutation because it is directed, potentially reversible, leaves the cell totipotent, and involves the expression of a latent differentiated function. By using cloned cell lines derived from pith parenchyma of tobacco, we have obtained evidence that the habituation process is gradual rather than all-or-none and leads to progressively more autotrophic tissues. Cells in culture show reversible shifts among a range of habituated states but remain totipotent and can be induced to regain their requirement for a cell division factor. Thus, it appears that habituation involves epigenetic changes in a quantitative cellular phenotype. Our findings support the hypothesis that tumor progression in <b>crown</b> <b>gall,</b> a neoplastic <b>disease</b> of higher plants, can be accounted for by heritable changes in the pattern of gene expression...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the effect of the host on the genetic {{stability}} of bacterial plant pathogens. <b>Crown</b> <b>gall,</b> a plant <b>disease</b> caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, may represent a useful model to study this effect. Indeed, our previous observations on the natural occurrence and origin of nonpathogenic agrobacteria suggest that the host plant might induce loss of pathogenicity in populations of A. tumefaciens. Here we report that five different A. tumefaciens strains initially isolated from apple tumors produced up to 99 % nonpathogenic mutants following their reintroduction into axenic apple plants. Two of these five strains were also found to produce mutants on pear and/or blackberry plants. Generally, the mutants of the apple isolate D 10 B/ 87 were altered in the tumor-inducing plasmid, harboring either deletions in this plasmid or point mutations in the regulatory virulence gene virG. Most of the mutants originating from the same tumor appeared to be of clonal origin, implying that the host plants influenced agrobacterial populations by favoring growth of nonpathogenic mutants over that of wild-type cells. This hypothesis was confirmed by coinoculation of apple rootstocks with strain D 10 B/ 87 and a nonpathogenic mutant...|$|R

Findings 1. Spermidine and spermine are present in normal potato tissue and <b>crown</b> <b>gall</b> tumor tissue grown on potato discs. 2. Exogenous spermidine and spermine do affect growth of <b>crown</b> <b>gall</b> tumors depending upon the concentration of the solutions added, the type of polyamine added and the number of times the solutions are applied. 3. Spermidine (1 mM) has a positive growth effect on <b>crown</b> <b>gall</b> tumors. 4. <b>Crown</b> <b>gall</b> tumor tissue contains more spermidine than corresponding normal potato tissue; spermine levels are consistently low compared to spermidine levels in both <b>crown</b> <b>gall</b> tissue and normal potato tissue. 5. The level of spermidine in tumor tissue increases as the tumors develop; the level of spermine remains consistently low. 6. Addition of methylglyoxal bis (guanylyhdrazone) inhibits tumor growth, but the inhibitory effect is decreased by concurrent administration of spermidine. 7. Both novobiocin and nalidixic acid have an inhibitory effect on tumor growth, but the effects are decreased by concurrent administration of spermidine. Reversal of the nalidixic acid effect on growth by addition of spermidine is more pronounced than reversal of the novobiocin effect. 8. Methylglyoxal bis (guanylhydrazone) decreases the endogenous levels of both spermidine and spermine in <b>crown</b> <b>gall</b> tumor tissue. Conclusions 1. The polyamine, spermidine, plays an important role in the growth of <b>crown</b> <b>gall</b> tumors. 2. Compounds which inhibit spermidine biosynthesis or the possible mode of action of spermidine inhibit tumor growth. 3. Other polyamines appear to have no significant role in <b>crown</b> <b>gall</b> tumor growth. 4.
