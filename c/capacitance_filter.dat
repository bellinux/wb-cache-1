40|$|The latest {{technology}} uses ceramic capacitors {{as the main}} part of filtering in DC/DC converters. This low-ripple solution is small and inexpensive. However, ceramic capacitors in the output filter require an advanced feedback and compensation circuit design than that used for traditional electrolytic capacitor. Transient performance of a DC/DC converter with a low-output <b>capacitance</b> <b>filter</b> depends significantly on the gain and bandwidth of the feedback loop. Ceramic capacitors cause higher resonant frequency of the output filter and a sharp phase lag, affecting stable operation of a DC/DC converter. Worst-case analysis for different conditions takes into account components and parameters tolerances. The suggested compensation-circuit design procedure ensures highest gain and bandwidth of frequency response, with comfortable phase and gain margin for stability. I...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{investigation}} is made into the limitations {{to the accuracy}} of balance of bridge measuring circuits as a result of noise. Particular attention is focused on the capacitance bridge. The sources of noise considered arise in the bridge circuit and the detector amplifier. Noise from the source oscillator, particularly {{in the case of a}} frequency sensitive bridge is also of consequence. A survey of preamplifier types suitable for use with a capacitance bridge is made to find the one contributing the least noise. These preamplifiers comprise untuned, tuned and parametric amplifiers. Theoretical consideration of a mechanically driven capacitor in a parametric up-converter amplifier indicates its usefulness as a low frequency amplifier. Investigations were made to determine the sources of noise in a vacuum tube preamplifier and relatively simple methods evolved for the determination of vacuum tube noise performance at low frequencies. The indicator displaying the bridge unbalance was considered in regard to its performance at small signal to noise ratios. A particular indicator is considered and the performance of the human operator in balancing a bridge using this unit is studied. For comparison an ideal detector comprising a phase sensitive detector followed by a resistance <b>capacitance</b> <b>filter</b> and perfect integrator is considered. A determination is made of the ultimate sensitivity of a bridge measuring system when using this type of indicator. The sources which contribute to the noise of the oscillator driving the bridge are discussed and a method for the reduction of the harmonic frequencies of the source at the output of a frequency sensitive bridge is described.

40|$|As {{with other}} bipolar analog devices, voltage {{regulators}} {{are known to}} be sensitive to single event transients (SET). In typical applications, large output capacitors are used to provide noise immunity. Therefore, since SET amplitude and duration are generally small, they are often of secondary importance due to this <b>capacitance</b> <b>filtering.</b> In low voltage applications, however, even small SET are a concern. Over-voltages may cause destructive conditions. Under-voltages may cause functional interrupts and may also trigger electrical latchup conditions. In addition, internal protection circuits which are affected by load as well as internal thermal effects can also be triggered from heavy ions, causing dropouts or shutdown ranging from milliseconds to seconds. In the case of FPGA power supplies applications, SETS are critical. For example, in the case of Actel FPGA RTAX family, core power supply voltage is 1. 5 V. Manufacturer specifies an absolute maximum rating of 1. 6 V and recommended operating conditions between 1. 425 V and 1. 575 V. Therefore, according to the manufacturer, any transient of amplitude greater than 75 mV can disrupt normal circuit functions, and overvoltages greater than 100 mV may damage the FPGA.

Studies of high-power SEP systems (i. e. tens to hundreds of kilowatts) suggest that significant mass savings may be realized by implementing a direct-drive power system, so NASA recently established the National Direct-Drive Testbed to examine technical issues identified by previous investigations. The testbed includes a 12 -kW solar array and power control station designed to power single and multiple Hall thrusters over a wide range of voltages and currents. In this paper, single Hall thruster operation directly from solar array output at discharge voltages of 200 to 450 V and discharge powers of 1 to 10 kW is reported. Hall thruster control and operation is shown to be simple and no different than for operation on conventional power supplies.
