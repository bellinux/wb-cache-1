40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, bitcoin has become a {{globally}} successful and much followed project. It {{is a kind of}} decentralized digital currency, which functions based on mathematical-cryptographical principles and is created using a computationally intensive process called mining. Thousands of other alternative crypto currencies exist, which have so far stayed unnoticed by the media, even though they outperform bitcoin in many aspects. The central topic of this paper is the extensive ecosystem of alternative crypto currencies and an analysis of their mining process. The goal is to demonstrate, by means of a practical example, how alternative crypto currencies are mined and also to find out, if it's possible to mine crypto currencies profitably with specific type of a graphic card. To successfully reach this goal I had to first analyse the ecosystem of crypto currencies. Subsequently I compared different crypto currencies to one another and eventually successfully implemented the mining operation and evaluated its results. The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} answer the question of whether and how alternative crypto currencies can be profitably mined.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the relation between}} the balance of payments and the international investment position of countries. It starts with the observation that the net international investment position of many countries is developing independently from their current account balances. This phenomenon can be explained by valuechanges of cross border assets and liabilities that are not registered on the balance of payments. These value changes have impact on the net external investment position of a country as soon as the returns on its external assets and liabilities start to diverge. Such divergent developments can be attributed to <b>currency</b> developments,differences of <b>composition</b> of external assets and liabilities and performance effects. These mechanisms are discussed, followed by two case studies, viz. the case of the ‘black hole’ (the Netherlands) and the case of ‘dark matter’(the US). Understanding {{the relation between the}} international investment position of a country and its balance of payments becomes more and more relevant as countries prepare for ageing of the population.

The consequences of the failure of such a policy are discussed in a concluding paragraph...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an integrated overview {{on the historical}} and contemporary literature dedicated {{to the study of}} within-country income inequality in Latin America. The central hypothesis of this report is that there are underlying factors that drive the persistent levels of high within-country inequality experienced by Latin American countries. We study two countries, Brazil and Bolivia, through the process of reform and growth, and note the effects on the labor markets. Using all available statistics and the wealth of knowledge compiled since the early 1980 s, this study identifies those trends, and the factors that cause them to reappear in numerous cases across South America. Focusing on periods of recession and post-stabilization growth in countries with rising or consistently unequal distributions of wealth, this report identifies viable trends in unemployment, linking them to external events and the social climate of Latin America. Employing case-study methodology (see Chapters 6 and 7) this thesis builds a framework with which to study national and regional inequality, then applies it to two cases: Brazil and Bolivia. This thesis’ main findings are that the political and economic reforms and restructurings during the crisis in the 1980 s, and the post- 1980 era of stabilization and growth, generally perpetuated or worsened the levels of income inequality for countries in Latin America. Further analysis concludes that unsustainable external debt, boom-and-bust cycles, more deeper-seated cultural factors cannot be overlooked. Low government spending on social and educational development is the unfortunate consequence of copious external debt and public interest payments in Latin America; instead of promoting long-term growth, Latin American regimes are instead forced to focus on high interest rates and protecting wildly volatile <b>currencies.</b> Ethnic <b>composition,</b> entrenched class-structure, and cultural norms each play significant roles in income disparity, the extent of which varies by case. The limitations of this research are firstly, that regression analysis is inconclusive; no strong correlation between growth and inequality can be observed, even within the highly unequal region of Latin America [...] Further, tax data, which provides the basis for measurements of income inequality, varies from country to country, making cross-country statistical meta-analysis difficult. Lastly, data was not collectible until the early 1980 s, and has missing observations, further complicating the task of statistical analysis. Thus, this study bases its findings on empirical evidence, data, and basic economic theory, in explaining the factors and causes of inequality...|$|R

40|$|Capital {{formation}} {{is a key}} driver {{of the growth of}} potential output. With continuing widespread capital controls and persistently small inward FDI the volume of capital formation in India is constrained by domestic saving. The national saving rate in India (the sum of the saving rates of households, enterprises and the state) is depressed by the continuing large public sector deficits (and much below the near 40 % of GDP saving rates achieved by China). Even this saving rate should be able to support a higher growth rate than has been achieved thus far. The reason it does not is that the intermediation of this saving into domestic capital {{formation is}} inefficient. Since the middle of the 1990 s, India's public debt has risen steadily as a share of GDP, but remains below the levels achieved {{at the time of the}} 1991 <b>currency</b> crisis. The <b>composition</b> of this debt is, however, significantly different from that in 1991 : external public debt is modest and international gold and foreign exchange reserves stand at historically high levels. The domestic debt is rupee-denominated. For all these reasons, government solvency may not be a pressing issue at this stage. Globally, risk-free rates at all maturities and all imaginable credit risk spreads are extraordinarily and unsustainably low. Continuation of the pattern of recent years - a steady increase in the debt-GDP ratio - will sooner or later raise the public debt to unsustainable levels. The fiscal rules adopted by the Indian Central Government under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act do not address the key distortions imposed by the authorities on the private sector through financial repression, misguided regulations and inefficient ownership and incentive structures. Nor do they address the underlying fiscal sustainability problem faced by the Indian state. In addition, they create a mechanism for macroeconomic volatility-enhancing, pro-cyclical fiscal policy. financial intermediation; financial repression; fiscal sustainability; Indian public finance...|$|R
