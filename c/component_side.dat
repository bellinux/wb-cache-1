A significant difference in the reliability performance of the components was observed: the components with the (Al) Ni(V) /Cu metallization (UBM) were more reliable than those with the electroless Ni(P) /Au metallization – independently of the bump, solder paste, surface finish materials or the pad structure of the boards used. The failure analyses revealed that the primary failure mode in the <b>component</b> <b>side</b> is the cracking of interconnections along a brittle NiSnP layer between the electroless Ni(P) of high P-content and the solder alloy, while components with (Al) Ni(V) /Cu UBM fail by cracking along the [Cu,Ni] 6 Sn 5 intermetallic layer. On the board side the cracking occurs in the porous NiSnP layer formed between the electroless Ni(P) metallization and the (Cu,Ni) 6 Sn 5 intermetallic layer. The fact that the cracking occurs predominantly at the components side reaction layer is due to three factors: higher normal stresses in the <b>component</b> <b>side,</b> brittleness of the reaction layer(s) and the strain-rate hardening of the bulk solder interconnections.

Three-dimensional, steady-state, turbulent air flow is assumed. Both straight and swirl flow cases at fans were considered. The actual air flow rate at fans was determined by matching the predicted pressure rise across the fan to the given fan characteristics. Experiments were performed under real ~dfe conditions. The act-ual computer chassis was tested inside a temperature-controlled chamber. Air temperatures between two printed circuit boards were measured in various positions and compared with the simulations. Results demonstrate a reasonable agreement between the temperatures obtained by simulations-and measurements. In all comparisons, average errors were less than 10 %. The introduction of swirl at fans made no significant effect on temperatures.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this paper}} is to derive a {{mathematical}} model for estimating the wind forces and wind moments effects a life raft. The mathematical model based on data from laboratory experiments. Forces due to the action of wind are adequately described. The governing physical equations, however, contain characteristics of the environment that are often not well quantified. In the strong wind condition, when the wind speed is much larger than the current and body speeds, all wind-generated forces must be taken into account. Friction and pressure forces exerted by the wind on the upper part of the floating body result in the wind force, which has a downwind component (drag) and a crosswind <b>component</b> (<b>side</b> force or lift), [1][2]. The drag component is always positive. The side force or lift component can be positive or negative[8]. The lift depends on the wind speed, body geometry, and strongly on the angle between the long axis of the floating body and the wind direction. In this paper the author presents models of wind forces acting at a life raft. Data from laboratory experiments (wind tunnel [5]) are used to build dynamical models...|$|E
40|$|Though butt-welds {{are among}} the most {{preferred}} joining methods in aerostructures, their strength dependence on inelastic mechanics is generally the least understood. This study investigated experimental strain distributions across a thick aluminum U-grooved weld and identified two weld process considerations for improving the multipass weld strength. One is the source of peaking in which the extreme thermal expansion and contraction gradient of the fusion heat input across the groove tab thickness produces severe angular distortion that induces bending under uniaxial loading. The other is the filler strain hardening decreasing with increasing filler pass sequences, producing the weakest welds on the last weld pass side. Both phenomena are governed by weld pass sequences. Many industrial welding schedules unknowingly compound these effects, which reduce the weld strength. A depeaking index model was developed to select filler pass thickness, pass numbers, and sequences to improve depeaking in the welding process. The result was to select the number and sequence of weld passes to reverse the peaking angle such as to combine the strongest weld pass side with the peaking induced bending tension <b>component</b> <b>side</b> to provide a more uniform stress and stronger weld under axial tensile loading...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a high {{electric}} current density on the interfacial reactions of micro ball grid array solder joints was studied at room temperature and at 150 °C. Four types of phenomena were reported. Along with electromigration-induced interfacial intermetallic compound (IMC) formation, dissolution at the Cu under bump metallization (UBM) /bond pad was also noticed. With a detailed investigation, {{it was found that}} the narrow and thin metallization at the <b>component</b> <b>side</b> produced “Joule heating” due to its higher resistance, which in turn was responsible for the rapid dissolution of the Cu UBM/bond pad near to the Cu trace. During an “electromigration test” of a solder joint, the heat generation due to Joule heating and the heat dissipation from the package should be considered carefully. When the heat dissipation fails to compete with the Joule heating, the solder joint melts and molten solder accelerates the interfacial reactions in the solder joint. The presence of a liquid phase was demonstrated from microstructural evidence of solder joints after different current stressing (ranging from 0. 3 to 2 A) as well as an in situ observation. Electromigration-induced liquid state diffusion of Cu was found to be responsible for the higher growth rate of the IMC on the anode side...|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanical}} approach employing cyclic twisting deformation to {{a surface}} mount assembly is examined {{as an alternative}} to temperature cycling for evaluating solder joints fatigue performance. This highly accelerated test is aimed at reducing solder joint reliability testing cycle time. In this study, the mechanics of solder joints in a surface mount assembly subjected to cyclic twisting deformation is investigated. For this purpose, a test package with 24 by 24 peripheral-array solder joints is modeled using the finite element method. Unified inelastic strain theory defines the strain-rate-dependent plastic stress-strain response of the 60 Sn- 40 Pb solder. Cyclic twisting deformation in the range of Â± 1 Â° per 50 mm length of the assembly board at a rate of 120 s per twist cycle was applied. The calculated stress and strain distributions in the critical solder joint are compared with those predicted for temperature cycling and accelerated temperature cycling tests. Results showed that the accumulated inelastic strain concentrates in a small region of the critical solder joint near the <b>component</b> <b>side</b> for temperature cycling and near the board side for cyclic twisting load cases. The rate of inelastic strain accumulation per fatigue cycle in the solder joint for both temperature cycling (TC 1) and mechanical twisting (MT 1) tests are similar. Thus, mechanical twisting test imparts similar deformation characteristics to temperature cycling tests in terms of the shear strain range. Low cycle fatigue is dominated by localized shear effect as reflected in the largest shear strain range of the hysteresis loops. The Coffin-Manson strain-based model yielded more conservative prediction of fatigue lives of solder joints when compared to energy-based approach. Â© 2007 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} years within power {{electronics}} packaging a trend towards compact power electronics modules for automotive and industrial applications could be observed, where a smart integrated control unit for motor drives is replacing bulky substrates with discrete control logic and power electronics. Most recent modules combine control and power electronics yielding maximum miniaturization. Transfer molding is the method of choice for cost effective encapsulation of such modules due to robustness of the molded modules and moderate cost of packaging. But there are challenges {{with this type of}} package: Typically those packages are asymmetric, a substrate with single sided assembly is overmolded on the <b>component</b> <b>side</b> and the substrate backside is exposed providing a heat path for optimized cooling. This asymmetric geometry is prone to yield warped substrates, preventing optimum thermal contact to the heatsink and also putting thermo-mechanical stress on the encapsulated components, possibly reducing reliability. Such packages being truly heterogeneous, combining powerICs, wire bonds, SMDs, controlICs, substrate and leadframe surfaces, the encapsulant used needs to adhere sufficiently to all surfaces present. Additionally those packages need to operate at elevated temperatures for long time, e. g. operate at 200 °C for 1000 h and more, so high thermal stability is of ample importance. Within this paper the main goal is to identify transfer molding compounds suitable for the encapsulation of smart power modules, ready to be used at 200 °C and determine the actual maximum temperature of use of such high performance molding compounds currently available in the market. Summarized {{a detailed description of the}} high temperature suitability of high performance molding compounds is provided-additionally an extended test methodology is described to facilitate future material evaluation for HT or harsh environment use of polymeric materials as encapsulants or base materials...|$|E
