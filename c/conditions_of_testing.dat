The chimpanzee showed more "testing" sequences (i. e., systematically varying his actions while oriented to the imitating experimenter) and more repetitive behaviour when lie was being imitated, than when he was not.

Two important factors studied which are encountered {{in the evaluation of}} corn hybrids were: (A) the effect of the type of yield adjustment used for missing hills at the Nebraska station and (B) the value of single-hill plots versus 2 x 5 hill plots. The data collected from two experiments involving 169 test crosses of corn in the year 1952 and 150 test crosses in 1953, grown at two locations, were used to study the effect of making adjustment for missing hills by the application of Jenkins’ formula. One location represented conditions of adequate moisture supply while the other location was one in which moisture was a limiting factor in crop production.

40|$|International audienceCuttlefish are {{sensitive}} to linear polarization of light, a sensitivity that they use in predation and possibly in intraspecific communication. It {{has also been shown}} that cuttlefish are able to solve a maze using visual landmarks. In this study, cuttlefish were trained to solve a Y-maze with the e-vector of a polarized light and landmarks as redundant spatial information. The results showed that cuttlefish can use the e-vector orientation and landmarks in parallel to orient and that they are able to use either type of cue when the other one is missing. When they faced conflicting spatial information in the experimental apparatus, the majority of cuttlefish followed the e-vector rather than landmarks. Differences in response latencies in the different <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> (training with both types of cue, tests with single cue or with conflicting information) were observed and discussed in terms of decision making.

A significant interaction of retention interval by race was obtained; for example, on the immediate test white subjects obtained higher recognition scores than black subjects while retention test recognition scores were higher for the black subjects on the one-week interval.

40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{this study}} was to {{elucidate}} the influence of the intrinsic properties of roughness, porosity, and surface pH on the susceptibility of mortars to biodegradation by phototrophic microorganisms. An accelerated fouling test was performed allowing a periodic sprinkling of an algae suspension on sample surfaces. The green alga Klebsormidium flaccidum was chosen due to its representativeness and facility in culturing. The biofouling of sample surfaces was evaluated by means of image analysis and color measurement. Two porosities, three roughnesses, and two surface pHs were examined. The colonization by algae of sample surfaces was not influenced by porosity because of the specific <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> that led to a constant high level of moistening of mortar samples. The roughness, in contrast, played an important role in biological colonization. A rougher surface facilitates the attachment of algal cells and so favors the extension of algae. The surface pH was the most important parameter. A lower surface pH accelerated considerably the development of algae on the samples surface. ...|$|E
