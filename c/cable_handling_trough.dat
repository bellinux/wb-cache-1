40|$|AbstractThe thesis in hand has {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} a cable electric ferry concept. The concept investigated is based on that a short route ferry receives its propulsive power through a cable connected to the land power grid. Four cable transfer configurations and associated equipment have been looked upon. The cable can either be stretched in the air over the route, it can float after the ferry, it can be towed submerged after the ferry, or it can follow the bottom contours after the ferry. The three latter configurations required storage and <b>cable</b> <b>handling</b> equipment, which can either be located onboard the ferry or on shore. The cable is reeled out under transit and spooled in on the way back. The air stretched configuration requires an arm type connection between the ferry and the cable {{in order to receive}} power. Current available technology has been assessed for concept realization in terms of <b>cable</b> and <b>handling</b> equipment. In addition, regulations for power onboard and emergency power systems are viewed upon, as well as regulations on emissions to air. Competing and alternative power systems to the concept have also been assessed. Lastly, a case study for concept implementation has been conducted. Findings made in the thesis include that current cable material composition and layer configurations will need engineering in terms of increasing strength, and reducing weight and dimension without influencing conductivity. Current <b>cable</b> <b>handling</b> equipment used in offshore cable laying vessels have good tension specifications for the concept, but compared to alternative power sources such as diesel- and LNG-gensets they have large weights and dimensions, and their operational handling speed is low for high tension levels. This gives that current technology would need development for concept realization. Weights and dimensions must be reduced, and handling speed must be increased such that the ferry is able to operate in normal transit with speed and payload. Further, the concept has also been economically compared with alternative power sources. With current technology the concept costs exceed the cost of competing alternatives, where the most expensive concept component is the cable. The cable cost exceeds the cost of a new LNG-genset. <b>Cable</b> <b>handling</b> equipment costs are relatively low compared to the cable. As for operational costs, electricity is found comparable with current LNG prices. But for maintenance costs, the concept is far more expensive than for instance a LNG-genset, because the cable will have relatively low operational lifecycle due to wear and fatigue, and will have to be replaced a lot sooner than gensets. And a genset can increase operational lifecycle by being overhauled, where pistons, bearings and seals are replaced. The concept is found physically feasible, but to meet the specification requirements equipment and components will need engineering and analyses. Economically, the concept is rather insufficient, but future local emission regulations and fuel costs may make the concept achievable. </p...|$|R

The various key factors affecting productivity, namely the cycle of operations, manpower deployment, machine efficiency, material handling and management of manpower are discussed.

40|$|Conductive cables {{have always}} {{represented}} {{a source of}} noise in ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data. In some instances, commercially available GPR systems use data processing tools to reduce cable noise. Such processes seldom respect the amplitude fidelity of the signal. For the purpose of careful, quantitative amplitude measurements, use of the raw recorded data is a critical starting point for reliable interpretation of results. During subsequent processing, users can compensate for cable effects to varying degrees. To illustrate the issues inherent with cable noise, we show an example where cable movement during data acquisition generates deviations in reflection amplitude up to 19 %. We then present the ramifications of these variations for quantitative data analysis. We conclude that precise <b>cable</b> <b>handling</b> can improve data quality and subsequent data interpretation. Our results are particularly pertinent for quantitative analysis and inversion of GPR data where precise amplitude information is crucial...|$|R

This value can be a constraint if it is necessary to position the EV very precisely in order to recharge. The wireless charger must be sufficiently tolerant to misalignment. Although already developed in other articles, the selected topology, combined with clever design based on Fresnel diagrams and simple control but with a significant dynamic, allows a large misalignment without loss of power or efficiency. The control method makes the charger compatible with the on-road charging. A demonstrator of 2 kW under 60 V, currently achieved, can demonstrate the performance of this topology, especially during movements of the secondary side relative to the primary side. We propose, in this paper, to control the output voltage and enable operation at low power to make the entire system a complete and efficient charger, while being able to operate dynamically.
