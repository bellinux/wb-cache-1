40|$|The study {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the importance and relevance of Urban Agriculture (UA) {{in the form of}} urban garden farming for vulnerable groups of people in the city of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. The study is based on fieldwork which was carried out between June and August 2008 in Bulawayo. This was also the time of political uncertainty due to shameful presidential elections which were presided and followed by violence and intimidation of the civilians. The focus of the study is on how urban gardens contribute to livelihoods and well being of the beneficiaries. The thesis employs the capability approach to address the research problem. The capability approach is modified and operationalised in a model that is relevant to this particular study. In the ensuing capability framework, gardens are treated as goods or services that enable beneficiaries to enjoy various <b>capability</b> <b>sets.</b> The study reveals that urban gardens are important in providing livelihoods and improving well-beings in crumbling urban economies such as that of Bulawayo. Beneficiaries utilise the <b>capability</b> <b>sets</b> provided by gardens in an attempt to improve their well being. <b>Capability</b> <b>sets</b> which include food security, income generation, political participation and social capital related are also critically discussed exploring their relevance and significance in improving people’s lives. One of the important issues in this study has been to acknowledge the diversity that exists amongst people. Even though the <b>capability</b> <b>sets</b> might be the same, they are explored differently by different people depending on external and internal factors affecting an individual. This makes the capability approach a powerful tool in that it enables a realistic understanding of people’s individual problems and potentials. In the Capability framework approach, various factors such as gender, physical condition, skill, education and institutions are discussed and their influence on what the beneficiaries can achieve from the gardens and the kind of life they want to choose to pursue thereafter is elaborated upon. Beneficiaries from the same garden benefitted in a different way depending on how they used the <b>capability</b> <b>sets.</b> This thus tended to determine the kind of life they eventually could chose to live. It is thus important in development studies to pay particular attention to individual problems and abilities than to study people en masse. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Capabilities are the {{alternative}} combinations of functionings that are feasible {{for a person}} to achieve. Formulations of capability have two parts: functionings and opportunity freedom — the substantive freedom to pursue different functioning combinations. Ultimately, capabilities denote a person's opportunity and ability to generate valuable outcomes, taking into account relevant personal characteristics and external factors. The important part of this definition is the [...] "freedom to achieve", because if freedom had only instrumental value (valuable as a means to achieve an end) and no intrinsic value (valuable in and of itself) to a person's well-being, then the value of the <b>capability</b> <b>set</b> as a whole would simply be defined by the value of a person's actual combination of functionings. Such a definition would not acknowledge the entirety of what a person is capable of doing and their resulting current state {{due to the nature of}} the options available to them. Consequently, the <b>capability</b> <b>set</b> outlined by this approach is not merely concerned with achievements; rather, freedom of choice, in and of itself, is of direct importance to a person's quality of life.|$|E

50|$|For example, the {{difference}} between fasting and starving, on person's well-being, is whether the person is choosing not to eat. In this example, the functioning is starving but the capability to obtain an adequate amount of food is the key element in evaluating well-being between individuals in the two states. In sum, having a lifestyle {{is not the same}} as choosing it; well-being depends on how that lifestyle came to be. More formally, while the combination of a person's functionings represents their actual achievements, their <b>capability</b> <b>set</b> represents their opportunity freedom — their freedom to choose between alternative combinations of functionings.|$|E

50|$|Polar orbits {{from the}} Air Force's Vandenberg Air Force Base are another matter entirely. Located {{slightly}} north of KSC, the distance it would move over a single orbit would be similar, but critically, the shuttle would be traveling south, not east. This {{meant that it}} was not flying toward the launch point as it traveled in its orbit, and when it completed one orbit it would have to make up the entire 1,350 miles during re-entry. These missions required a dramatically improved cross-range <b>capability,</b> <b>set</b> at 1,500 miles to give it a slight excess capability.

5000|$|In other words, functionings are the {{subjects}} of the capabilities {{referred to in the}} approach: what we are capable, want to be capable, or should be capable to be and/or do.

Yet, functionings can also be conceptualized in a way that signifies an individual's capabilities. Eating, starving, and fasting would all be considered functionings, but the functioning of fasting differs significantly from that of starving because fasting, unlike starving, involves a choice and is understood as choosing to starve despite the presence of other options. [...] Consequently, an understanding of what constitutes functionings is inherently tied together with an understanding of capabilities, as defined by this approach.|$|E
