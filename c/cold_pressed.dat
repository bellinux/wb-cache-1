In Assam, black sesame seeds are used to make til pitha and tilor laru (sesame seed balls) during bihu. In Punjab and Tamil Nadu, a sweet ball called pinni in Urdu and ell urundai in Tamil, ellunda in Malayalam, yellunde/Chigali, (sesame ball, usually in jaggery), is made of its seeds mixed with sugar.

40|$|In {{order to}} predict the {{conditions}} for which the lunar regolith may be adequately sintered, experiments were conducted in which samples of simulated lunar basalt (MLS- 1) were pressed at high pressures and then heated in an electric furnace. This sintering process may {{be referred to as}} <b>cold</b> <b>press</b> sintering since the material is pressed at room temperature. Although test articles were produced which possessed compressive strengths comparable to that of terrestrial concrete, the <b>cold</b> <b>press</b> sintering process requires very high press pressures and sintering temperatures in order to achieve that strength.

25|$|The {{company has}} a long history of acquisitions. Coca-Cola {{acquired}} Minute Maid in 1960, the Indian cola brand Thums Up in 1993, and Barq's in 1995. In 2001, it acquired the Odwalla brand of fruit juices, smoothies, and bars for $181million. In 2007, it acquired Fuze Beverage from founder Lance Collins and Castanea Partners for an estimated $250million. The company's 2009 bid to buy a Chinese juice maker ended when China rejected its $2.4billion bid for the Huiyuan Juice Group, on the grounds the resulting company would be a virtual monopoly. Nationalism was also thought to be a reason for aborting the deal. In 1982, Coca-Cola purchased Columbia Pictures for $692 million. It sold the movie studio to Sony, for $3 billion, in 1989. In 2013, Coca-Cola finalized its purchase of ZICO, a coconut water company. In 2011, the Coca-Cola company bought the rest of the organic tea company Honest Tea, after buying a 40% stake in the company in 2008.

40|$|Abstract. Selective Laser Sintering could {{manufacture}} high complex {{metal parts}} in short time but with high porosity and low strength. The components from <b>Cold</b> Isostatic <b>Pressing</b> have excellent performance with uniform organizational structure, high size precision, and high density. It, however, could not form high complex parts {{because of the}} difficulties of bag manufacture. So {{it will be a}} good method to combine Selective Laser Sintering and <b>Cold</b> Isostatic <b>Pressing</b> to make complicated metal parts. In this paper, the specimens of stainless steel were made by the combined Selective Laser Sintering and <b>Cold</b> Isostatic <b>Pressing</b> forming route. And the simulation of <b>Cold</b> Isostatic <b>Pressing</b> was carried out by finite element method and Drucker-Prager-Cap constitutive model in ABAQUS/Explicit computer program. The property of metal powder was measured by experiments. The effects of bag on <b>Cold</b> Isostatic <b>Pressing</b> have been discussed. It is different from the <b>Cold</b> Isostatic <b>Pressing</b> of metal powder that the bag has little influence on both shape and size of the specimen. The results of simulation show a good agreement between the experimental results and the calculated results.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of walnut oil commercially available: <b>cold</b> <b>pressed</b> and refined. <b>Cold</b> <b>pressed</b> walnut oil is {{typically}} more expensive due to the loss of a higher percentage of the oil. Refined walnut oil is expeller pressed and saturated with solvent to extract the highest percentage of oil available in the nut meat.

Walnut oil, like all nut, seed and vegetable oils will undergo rancidification accelerated by heat, light, and oxygen.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{concerning}} petroleum price increasing and environmental impact, more attention is attracted to renewable resources for transportation fuels. Because not conflict with human and animal food resources, non-food vegetable oils are promising sources for developing bio-jet fuels. Extracting vegetable oil from oilseeds is the first critical step in the pathway of bio-jet fuel production. When sunflower seeds are de-hulled, there are always about 5 %– 15 % broken seed kernels (fine meat particles) left over as residual wastes with oil content up to 48 %. However, the oil extracted from these sunflower seed residues is non-edible due to its quality not meeting food standards. Genetically modified sunflower grown on margin lands has been identified one of sustainable biofuel sources since it doesn't compete to arable land uses. Sunflower oils extraction from non-food sunflower seeds, sunflower meats, and fine sunflower meats (seed de-hulling residue) was carried out using a <b>cold</b> <b>press</b> method in this study. Characterization of the sunflower oils produced was performed. The effect of <b>cold</b> <b>press</b> rotary frequency on oil recovery and quality was discussed. The results show that higher oil recovery was obtained at lower rotary frequencies. The highest oil recovery for sunflower seeds, sunflower meats, and fine sunflower meats in the tests were 75. 67 %, 89. 74 % and 83. 19 % respectively. The <b>cold</b> <b>press</b> operating conditions had minor influence on the sunflower oil quality. Sunflower meat oils produced at 15 Hz were preliminarily upgraded and distilled. The properties of the upgraded sunflower oils were improved. Though further study is needed {{for the improvement of}} processing cost and oil recovery, <b>cold</b> <b>press</b> has shown promising to extract oil from non-food sunflower seeds for future bio-jet fuel production...|$|R

The chemical changes occurring in oils were eval-uated. Free fatty acid content, polar compounds, colour and viscosity of the oils all increased, whereas the iodine value, smoke point, polyunsaturated fatty acid content, induction period and tocopherol content decreased. The effect of the oil on the organoleptic quality of these fried foods and the theoretical number of frying operations possible before having to discard the oil was also determined.

This assembly method allows larger magnitude of interference between rotor and crankshaft.
