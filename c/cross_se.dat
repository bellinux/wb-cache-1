40|$|The {{terminal}} ballistic {{performance of}} an HE-shell is usually {{characterized by the}} spatial distributions of number, mass and velocity of the produced natural fragments and is {{described in terms of}} vulnerability probabilities. However, the efficiency of a single fragment depends on its geometrical shape and size, its orientation at impact and the striking velocity. This impact velocity is also interrelated to the geometrical size, because the external ballistic resistance is determined by the cross section of the flying fragments. Therefore, a comprehensive characterization of the performance of shells requires besides mass/number distributions descriptions of fragment size and shape distributions. As an example, lengths, widths, and thicknesses were determined for recovered fragments of statically exploded 155 -m HE-shells. The statistical evaluation of the results allowed to derive formulas which describe the distributions of the geometrical dimensions, aspect ratios, and mean <b>cross</b> <b>se</b> ctions correlated to fragment mass and frequency.

An analysis chain of global correction m ethod (h- method) was established for the thin carbon target and as well for T 2 K replica targ et and compared to the results obtained with full particle identification. The h- method permits to cover larger phase space region not otherwise accessible. In addition, a full chain of V 0 analysis was prepared to obtain neutral Kaon and Lambda results in polar angle and momentum variables (p, θ). Results on the differential production cross sections and mean mul tiplicities in production processes for negatively charged pions (in three sets of variable s: (p, θ), (xf, p T), (y, p T)), neutral Kaons (in (p, θ) and (y,p T)), and Lambdas (in (p, θ)) from proton Carbon interactions at 31 GeV/c in tabularized forms were obtained. In addition, an in clusive cross section for neutral Kaon production corrected to the whole phase space regio n was obtained: σ (K 0 S) = 28. 58 ± 1. 85 (stat) ± 1. 72 (sys) mb The final results obtained in this dissertation are crucial for the T 2 K long baseline neutrino experiment and also of value for future ne utrino oscillation experiments, which will use conventional neutrino beams, and for existing a nd future cosmic-ray physics experiments.

60|$|In {{all these}} respects {{the forms of}} the same undoubted species, when illegitimately united, behave {{in exactly the same}} manner as do two {{distinct}} species when crossed. This led me carefully to observe during four years many seedlings, raised from several illegitimate unions. The chief result is that these illegitimate plants, as they may be called, are not fully fertile. It is possible to raise from dimorphic species, both long-styled and short-styled illegitimate plants, and from trimorphic plants all three illegitimate forms. These can then be properly united in a legitimate manner. When this is done, there is no apparent reason why they should not yield as many seeds as did their parents when legitimately fertilised. But such is not the case; they are all infertile, but in various degrees; some being so utterly and incurably sterile that they did not yield during four seasons a single seed or even seed-capsule. These illegitimate plants, which are so sterile, although united with each other in a legitimate manner, may be strictly compared with hybrids when <b>crossed</b> inter <b>se,</b> and it is well known how sterile these latter generally are. When, on the other hand, a hybrid is crossed with either pure parent- species, the sterility is usually much lessened: and so it is when an illegitimate plant is fertilised by a legitimate plant. In the same manner as the sterility of hybrids does not always run parallel with the difficulty of making the first cross between the two parent-species, so the sterility of certain illegitimate plants was unusually great, whilst the sterility of the union from which they were derived was by no means great. With hybrids raised from the same seed-capsule the degree of sterility is innately variable, so it is in a marked manner with illegitimate plants. Lastly, many hybrids are profuse and persistent flowerers, whilst other and more sterile hybrids produce few flowers, and are weak, miserable dwarfs; exactly similar cases occur with the illegitimate offspring of various dimorphic and trimorphic plants.|$|R
