60|$|Milk.--We {{have seen}} in the last chapter that milk acts most powerfully on the leaves; but whether {{this is due to the}} {{contained}} casein or albumen, I know not. Rather large drops of milk excite so much secretion (which is very acid) that it sometimes trickles down [page 114] from the leaves, and this is likewise characteristic of chemically prepared casein. Minute drops of milk, placed on leaves, were coagulated in about ten minutes. Schiff denies* that the <b>coagulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> by gastric juice is exclusively due to the acid which is present, but attributes it in part to the pepsin; and it seems doubtful whether with Drosera the coagulation can be wholly due to the acid, as the secretion does not commonly colour litmus paper until the tentacles have become well inflected; whereas the coagulation commences, as we have seen, in about ten minutes. Minute drops of skimmed milk were placed on the discs of five leaves; and a large proportion of the coagulated matter or curd was dissolved in 6 hrs. and still more completely in 8 hrs. These leaves re-expanded after two days, and the viscid fluid left on their discs was then carefully scraped off and examined. It seemed at first sight as if all the casein had not been dissolved, for a little matter was left which appeared of a whitish colour by reflected light. But this matter, when examined under a high power, and when compared with a minute drop of skimmed milk coagulated by acetic acid, was seen to consist exclusively of oil-globules, more or less aggregated together, with no trace of casein. As I was not familiar with the microscopical appearance of milk, I asked Dr. Lauder Brunton to examine the slides, and he tested the globules with ether, and found that they were dissolved. We may, therefore, conclude that the secretion quickly dissolves casein, in the state in which it exists in milk.|$|E
40|$|Acidic and enzymatic <b>coagulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> {{are complex}} {{processes}} which proceed in several phases and are dependent upon many different parameters. The formation of coagulum during lactic-acid fermentation {{is in fact}} acidic <b>coagulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> It occurs because {{of an increase in}} concentration of lactic acid, which causes a decrease in pH.

The models presented in this paper enable a more complex mathematical analysis of the coagulation of the protein content of milk during lactic-acid fermentation. Application of the models enables the analysis and comparison of the kinetics of coagulation in different types of milk and various types of fermented dairy products manufactured with lactic acid bacteria.

40|$|International audienceAbstractDuring sheep cheese manufacturing, {{the time}} {{determination}} for such important steps as clotting and cutting time {{relies on the}} experience of the cheese maker or, alternatively, on predetermined reaction times.

Therefore, a near-infrared (NIR) light backscatter fiber optic sensor was implemented in order to monitor <b>coagulation</b> <b>of</b> sheep <b>milk</b> and assess the possibility of estimating both clotting and cutting times during the manufacture of sheep’s cheese. A randomized block experiment with three replications was designed to determine optical, rheological, and visual coagulation parameters in sheep milk using four enzyme concentrations.

Addition of 5 % (v/v) ethanol reduced the rennet coagulation time (RCT) of milk, whereas higher levels of ethanol (10 - 20 %, v/v) progressively increased RCT. The temperature at which milk was coagulable by rennet decreased with increasing ethanol content of the milk. The primary stage of rennet coagulation, i. e., the enzymatic hydrolysis of kappa-casein, was progressively slowed with increasing ethanol content (5 - 20 %, v/v), possibly due to ethanol-induced conformational changes in the enzyme molecule.

At all temperatures, β-Lg was more sensitive to thermal denaturation than α-La. The extent of association of β-Lg and α-La with the casein micelles, as determined by the total amounts of these proteins (SDS-PAGE) remaining in the ultracentrifugal supernatants <b>of</b> heated <b>milks,</b> also increased with the severity of heat treatment. At any given temperature, association of these proteins with casein micelles was much less than the amount that denatured. The extent of incorporation of β-Lg and α-La into rennet gels increased with temperature and could be related to the levels of denaturation of β-Lg and its association with casein micelles. Heat treatment impaired the rennet <b>coagulation</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> as indicated by an increase in gelation times and a decrease in gel strengths (both determined using the Bohlin VOR Rheometer). There was a close correlation between the extents of association of β-Lg with the casein micelles and the changes in gelation time or gel strength. When heated milks were acidified to pH 5. 5 and re-neutralised to pH 6. 5 (pH cycled), the adverse effects of heat treatment on rennet coagulation were reduced, except for those milks heated at temperatures above 120 °C. The rennet <b>coagulation</b> properties <b>of</b> heated <b>milks</b> were markedly improved by addition of low concentrations of CaCl 2, but no additional improvement resulted when CaCl 2 addition was combined with pH cycling. Concentration <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> by ultrafiltration (UF) lengthened gelation time but increased gel strength, the effect being dependent on the volume concentration ratio (VCR). Heat treatment <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> (140 °C for 4 s) before or after UF increased gelation times and lowered gel strengths with weaker gels being formed from milks heated prior to UF. pH cycling <b>of</b> heated <b>milk</b> before UF or of heated UF concentrates had an adverse effect on rennet <b>coagulation</b> properties <b>of</b> the UF concentrates.

The influence <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> age was also considered, using individual cow milk samples held for zero to five days. Coagulation time did not vary significantly over the five day period. Overall, {{the results of this}} study indicate that breed, lactation stage, initial pH, and protein composition significantly impact milk coagulation rate...|$|R
40|$|Contents of casein {{fractions}} {{are known}} to affect coagulation properties and cheese yield <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> but studies {{on the effects of}} κ-CN composition on variation <b>of</b> <b>coagulation</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> are still very scarce. Effects exerted by κ-CN composition on variation <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> properties (MCP) were investigated using 2, 084 individual <b>milk</b> samples <b>of</b> Simmental cows. Rennet coagulation time (RCT), and curd firmness (A 30) were measured using a computerized renneting meter. Milk protein composition and genotypes at CSN 2, CSN 3 and BLG were obtained by reversed-phase HPLC. The percentage ratios of κ-CN (κCN%), of Glycosylated-κ-CN (G-κCN%), and Unglycosylated-κ-CN (U-κCN%) to total casein were measured. The degree of glycosylation (GD) was measured as the percentage ratio of glycosylated-κ-CN to total κ-CN. A difference of 1. 7 min (corresponding to 0. 37 SD of the trait) was observed for the average RCT of the two extreme classes of κCN% content. RCT decreased when κCN% and G-κCN% increased, whereas U-κCN% exhibited a slightly unfavourable effect on the onset <b>of</b> the <b>coagulation</b> process. A slight decrease of RCT was also observed for high GD, although this effect was less clear than that of G-κCN%. A favourable effect of κCN%, G-κCN% and GD on A 30 was also detected...|$|R
