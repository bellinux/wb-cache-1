Under this plan, the current year's premium is based partially (or wholly) on the current year's losses, although the premium adjustments may take months or years beyond the current year's expiration date. The rating formula is guaranteed in the insurance contract. Formula: retrospective premium = converted loss + basic premium × tax multiplier. Numerous variations of this formula have been developed and are in use.|$|E

2500|$|The Fortescue {{volume was}} to have covered the war but he wrote so slowly, that {{it was decided to}} end his volume at May 1915 and only cover France. Edmonds also came to doubt the quality of the work, judging Fortescue to be ignorant of the {{workings}} of a contemporary army, apparently being [...] behind the times; Fortescue had excluded dates and times and used obsolete language. Fortescue agreed to revise his draft but then took no notice, his second draft being confused, containing nothing about the general situation and hardly referring to the Germans. Senior officers were ridiculed, the government blamed for not stopping the war and the French effort was [...] "slurred over in less than one typewritten page". Edmonds blamed Fortescue for lacking interest, lethargy and ignoring the records made available, bungling the chance to write an exciting story of the BEF, by delivering a patchwork of unit diaries. At the end of the year, Edmonds decided to rewrite the work because of Fortescue's prevarication and [...] "grossly inaccurate and misleading" [...] writing; Fortescue was sacked and Edmonds even wanted him to be made to pay back his salary. After the unfortunate experience with Fortescue, Edmonds decided that an account must be enhanced by statements, private records of officers and by German material, to counter [...] "garbled" [...] accounts by the likes of Arthur Conan Doyle and John Buchan. Soundings with publishers and authors convinced Edmonds, that a work based on dispatches would fail to engage the public. An educational work needed a foundation on which to base teaching, conclusions which were similar to those of Hankey, that a work must be readable enough for the public to buy, be a credible educational work for the military student and rebut inaccurate <b>commercial</b> <b>accounts</b> by [...] civilian authors.|$|E

40|$|Newly {{exporting}} {{small and}} medium-sized enterprises have not, to date, has sufficient focus from the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation 2 ̆ 7 s assistance with export finance and insurance, according to this report. Key points These key points were released with the Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Export Credit Arrangements draft report on 22 February 2012. The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) has been established to facilitate and encourage Australian export trade through the provision of financial services. It provides these services on a <b>commercial</b> <b>account</b> and manages the national interest account on behalf of the Australian Government. The rationale for EFIC operating a <b>commercial</b> <b>account</b> should be to address the limited number of market failures in financial markets that impede otherwise commercially viable export transactions. At present EFIC 2 ̆ 7 s activity on the <b>commercial</b> <b>account</b> is largely focussed on large corporate clients and often repeat customers. The Commission has found no convincing evidence to indicate there are failures in financial markets that impede access to finance for large firms, or for domestic resource projects. EFIC should not continue to provide finance to large corporate clients or for domestic resource projects on the <b>commercial</b> <b>account.</b> The Commission 2 ̆ 7 s preliminary assessment is that there may be some instances of information-related failures in financial markets, and that these failures may impede otherwise commercially viable export transactions. To the extent that they exist, these information-related failures are only likely to affect newly exporting {{small and medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) accessing export finance. Until it is next reviewed, EFIC 2 ̆ 7 s <b>commercial</b> <b>account</b> objective should be to address the information-related failures in financial markets that affect newly exporting SMEs. EFIC 2 ̆ 7 s role should be to demonstrate to the private sector that providing export finance to these exporters can be commercially viable. EFIC must provide export finance services on the same basis as the private sector. This means EFIC should: charge a price covering the full economic cost of provision be subject to competitive neutrality policy including earning an appropriately benchmarked rate of return on equity, setting prices commensurate with the level of risk undertaken, and paying a tax equivalent charge and a debt neutrality fee publish information on the transactions it approves on the <b>commercial</b> <b>account,</b> including the name of the firm, price and other terms of provision. EFIC 2 ̆ 7 s <b>commercial</b> <b>account</b> product range should be limited to guarantees. When directed by the Minister for Trade, the product range on the <b>commercial</b> <b>account</b> may extend to reinsurance, for a limited period, to cover sovereign and country risk insurance provided to SMEs. EFIC 2 ̆ 7 s activities on the <b>commercial</b> <b>account</b> have earned a relatively low rate of return on equity. Some transactions on the <b>commercial</b> <b>account</b> are subsidised by taxpayers. The Commission 2 ̆ 7 s proposals seek to address this. Measures should be introduced to improve the transparency of EFIC 2 ̆ 7 s activities to the Minister for Trade, the Australian Government, and the public. Measures should also be introduced by the Australian Government to improve the transparency of national interest account transactions.
