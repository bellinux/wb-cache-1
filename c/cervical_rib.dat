25|$|The {{structure}} of the stegosaurid family tree has been debated for a while. However, {{in two of the}} most extensive cladistics analyses of Stegosauria conducted to date, both Mateus et al. (2009) and Maidment (2010) present similar phylogenetic relationships within Stegosauridae (shown below). The well-resolved phylogenies place the newly discovered long-necked stegosaurid Miragaia as sister taxa to Dacentrurus forming the clade Dacentrurinae. Mateus et al. note that in both Miragaia and Dacentrurus, the <b>cervical</b> <b>rib</b> projects posteriorly and the anterior pubic process is dorsoventrally deep and bears a dorsal projection at its anterior tip in lateral view. Their phylogeny also points to a sister-group relationship between the new clade Dacentrurinae and the genus Stegosaurus, supported by the shared presence of postzygapophyses on cervical vertebrae that are elongate and project posterior to the posterior centrum facet. Dacentrurus was previously considered to be a basal stegosaurid, but the discovery and observation of Miragaia has suggested that it is a derived taxon.|$|E
500|$|Some {{mutations}} {{occur in}} [...] "toolkit" [...] or regulatory genes. Changes in these often have large {{effects on the}} phenotype of the individual because they regulate the function of many other genes. Most, but not all, mutations in regulatory genes result in non-viable embryos. Some nonlethal regulatory mutations occur in HOX genes in humans, which {{can result in a}} <b>cervical</b> <b>rib</b> or polydactyly, {{an increase in the number}} of fingers or toes. When such mutations result in a higher fitness, natural selection favours these phenotypes and the novel trait spreads in the population.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>{{cervical}}</b> <b>rib</b> {{in humans}} is an extra rib which {{arises from the}} seventh cervical vertebra. Sometimes known as [...] "neck ribs", their presence is a congenital abnormality located above the normal first rib.

40|$|A {{familiarity}} with the anatomy of some types of bone anomalies is necessary for clinicians involved in many medical areas.

The incidence of <b>cervical</b> <b>ribs</b> has been found to vary from 0. 58 % in Malaysian population to 6. 2 % in Turkish population. <b>Cervical</b> <b>ribs</b> have clinical implications that are generally divided into neurological or vascular.

50|$|Recent {{studies have}} also found a high percent of <b>cervical</b> <b>ribs</b> in woolly mammoths. It is {{believed}} that the decline in mammoth numbers may have forced inbreeding within the species {{which in turn has}} increased the number of mammoths being born with <b>cervical</b> <b>ribs.</b> <b>Cervical</b> <b>ribs</b> have been connected with leukaemia in human children, so it has given scientists new evidence to believe that the mammoth's extinction was attributed to the condition.|$|R

Controversy surrounds the diagnosis and management of thoracic outlet syndrome with or without <b>cervical</b> <b>ribs.</b> This is a small study of 20 cases carried out from 1994 to 2003 at RMCH, and some private hospitals. Out of them, 15 patients (75 %) were male and 5 patients (25 %) were female. The age of the patients was between 15 to 48 years (mean age 33 years) Unilateral <b>cervical</b> <b>ribs</b> were present in 75 % cases and the rest 25 % had bilateral <b>cervical</b> <b>ribs.</b> Only 3 patients presented with gangrenous upper limb.

25|$|Only the capitula, tubercula, {{and part}} of the {{anterior}} and posterior processes of the <b>cervical</b> <b>ribs</b> are preserved. The ribs are fused to their respective vertebrae. The <b>cervical</b> <b>ribs</b> are pendant, extending ventrally for a distance subequal to the height of the centrum, as in several other East Asian Cretaceous sauropods. In both cervical vertebrae, the tuberculum is notably slender anteroposteriorly, especially in comparison with the capitulum.

50|$|In 1993, M. sinocanadorum was described, which {{consisted}} of skull material and the first four cervical vertebrae.

50|$|Compression of the {{brachial plexus}} may be {{identified}} by weakness of the muscles around the muscles in the hand, near {{the base of the}} thumb. Compression of the subclavian artery is often diagnosed by finding a positive Adson's sign on examination, where the radial pulse in the arm is lost during abduction and external rotation of the shoulder. A positive Adson's sign is non-specific for the presence of a <b>cervical</b> <b>rib</b> however, as many individuals without a <b>cervical</b> <b>rib</b> will have a positive test.|$|E
50|$|Variations in {{the number}} of ribs occur. About 1 in 200-500 people have an {{additional}} <b>cervical</b> <b>rib,</b> and there is a female predominance. Intrathoracic supernumerary ribs are extremely rare. Bifid or bifurcated ribs, in which the sternal end of the rib is cleaved in two, is a congenital abnormality occurring in about 1.2% of the population. The rib remnant of the 7th cervical vertebra on one or both sides is occasionally replaced by a free extra rib called a <b>cervical</b> <b>rib,</b> which can mechanically interfere with the nerves (brachial plexus) going to the arm.|$|E

40|$|A 4 -year-old intact female, mixed {{breed dog}} was {{presented}} with a complaint of dyspnea. Clinical examination revealed symptoms related to disease of the upper airways. Radiographic findings were consistent with tracheal collapse associated with anomalies involving the seventh cervical vertebra and the first ribs bilaterally. Radiographs were highly suggestive of cervical ribs; computed tomography and ultrasound examination allowed complete characterization and better localization of the anomalies with relationship to the adjacent muscle and vasculature. <b>Cervical</b> <b>ribs</b> are malformations widely described in human medicine, but only sporadically in dogs.

Examination of the bones revealed that they are honeycombed with tiny air cells, and are very thin, like the bones of a chicken or an ostrich, making the neck lighter and easier to lift.

50|$|The {{vertebra}} prominens, or C7, has {{a distinctive}} long and prominent spinous process, which is palpable {{from the skin}} surface. Sometimes, the seventh cervical vertebra is associated with an abnormal extra rib, known as a <b>cervical</b> <b>rib,</b> which develops from the anterior root of the transverse process. These ribs are usually small, but may occasionally compress blood vessels (such as the subclavian artery or subclavian vein) or nerves in the brachial plexus, causing pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the upper limb, a condition known as thoracic outlet syndrome. Very rarely, this rib occurs in a pair.|$|E
