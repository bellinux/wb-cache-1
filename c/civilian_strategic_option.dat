40|$|Combating piracy is {{an age-old}} mission for {{international}} navies, as piracy has troubled ocean-going vessels for centuries. Somali piracy, like all piracy uprisings in the past, is a land-based problem {{stemming from a}} dysfunctional government that cannot enforce {{the laws of the}} land. This lack of law enforcement is what provides pirates a safe harbor to operate, which allows the problem to trickle into international waters and become a maritime problem. However, in the case of Somali piracy, leaders from the U. S. State Department and the U. S. Navy have said there is too much water in the Indian Ocean for the coalition navies to effectively patrol. This thesis first demonstrates how the MMOWGLI platform can be used for crowd-sourced brainstorming of <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> for counter-piracy, yielding valuable action plans that can be modeled, simulated, and analyzed to make strategic decisions. Three highly rated Action Plans from the 2012 Piracy MMOWGLI game were then modeled and simulated using Discrete Event Simulation (DES). Simulation analysis suggests that the amount of ocean is not a factor if coalition navies aggressively patrol the Somali coast, either directly off shore from active pirate camps or by the use of a naval quarantine. Strategy development for counter-piracy, like any other wicked strategic problem, is usually conducted by senior naval leaders in the upper echelons of specific commands. The MMOWGLI game-play from Piracy MMOWGLI and other MMOWGLI games suggests the U. S. Navy needs to consider utilizing a broader range of officers, enlisted personnel and <b>civilians</b> for brainstorming <b>strategic</b> <b>options.</b> There are an unprecedented number of enlisted sailors with degrees and junior officers educated in joint professional military education. It is time the military taps into this knowledge base for help in planning and implementing strategy. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The {{high level}} of {{competition}} and uncertainty forced firms to make right and on time strategic decisions in order to survive. The management practices for the stable environments are not suitable for the new dynamic environment. In order {{to respond to this}} dynamic and uncertain environment, managers and academicians focused on the organization’s strategic flexibility. According to the <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> view the main property of strategic flexibility is the ability to access to the resources and capabilities when they are needed (Sanchez, 1997). Strategic flexibility is defined as “condition of having <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> that are created through combined effects of an organization’s coordination flexibility in acquiring and using flexible resources ” (Sanchez, 1993). According to this definition in order to have strategic flexibility, firms need to have <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> and the main task of the managers is to define, develop, acquire and coordinate the resources and competencies that will optimize the value of <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> cluster. In order to optimize <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> cluster managers should effectively manage competence building and competence leveraging processes. In order to have effective competence building and competence leveraging processes we should answer the questions “What are the factors effecting these processes"? However, the selection of a suitable <b>strategic</b> <b>option</b> is not an easy decision, involving a lot of complex considerations. Therefore this study focuses on the factors effecting the exercising decision of a <b>strategic</b> <b>option.</b> An analytical hierarchy process is applied to selecting <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> that will be exercised...|$|R

This paper discusses this development in the PPI and offers some illustrative examples to demonstrate the vital need for opening up new <b>strategic</b> <b>options.</b> To address these challenges, we launch a dynamic strategic framework for a PPI firm. This dynamic capabilities- and strategic options-based framework comprises of (i) sensing the weak signals of the operational environment, (ii) formulating them as <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> in order to capture their upside potential, (iii) hedging against the downside risks of the options, (iv) exercising these options in often thin (i. e., imperfect) intangible knowledge assets markets, and (v) reconfiguring the existing knowledge base and capabilities to sustain competitive advantage obtained.

The corporate business strategies followed by Ericsson, as well as the <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> taken regarding the TV & Media business, and the analysis to the diversification strategy, as well as to the <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> taken, constitute interesting topics for discussion in strategy courses, supported by the theoretical concepts and strategy frameworks proposed in the literature review.

40|$|We {{would like}} to thank Carliss Baldwin and Ned Bowman for many helpful discussions, Arie Lewin and the {{anonymous}} referees for their comments, and managers of Lucent for a reality check on some ideas. 1 Capabilities as Real Options Strategy research consists of a balance between positive and normative theory. In recent years, normative theory has drawn heavily from industrial economics for its positive justification. Resource and knowledge-based theories of strategy, however, rely on research on rganiz tions as a complementary foundation to industrial economics. This paper explores the joint connection of organizational theories and financial economics by developing the argument that capabilities, or core competencies, are <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> that provide platforms for the exploration of market opportunities. Investments in these capabilities have an irreversible character because of the complex interdependencies among organizational and technological elements. These interdependencies are rooted in the impediments to organizational adaptation and change. Yet, this inertia is exactly why organizational capabilities have an irreversible quality, and it is this irreversibility that defines the value of capabilities as <b>strategic</b> <b>options.</b> We formally motivate these ideas for the evaluation of capabilities as <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> throug...|$|R
40|$|Although a large {{series of}} papers have been {{concerned}} with macroeconomic issues such as price stability or employment, very few studies have discussed {{the impact of the}} euro on the competitive structure of European banking markets. Two questions are being addressed in this paper: How does the move from national currencies to the euro alter the sources of competitive advantage of banks? What are the main <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> available to financial firms? A review of the European banking industry shows the apparent importance of a national currency. For instance, the markets for pension funds and mutual fund management, or the euro-francs and euro-guilder bond markets are quite fragmented with domestic institutions capturing a very large market share. This paper shows how, besides an obvious loss of intra-European currencies trading business, the introduction of a common currency changes fundamentally the sources of competitive advantage of banks. Clearly, this calls for a major review of <b>strategic</b> <b>options.</b> The paper is structured in two parts. Drawing on research discussed in an earlier EIB Papers article, the first section summarises a number of impacts of the euro (1).
