40|$|The {{evolution}} of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) during (photo-) <b>chemical</b> <b>aging</b> processes {{was investigated in}} a smog chamber. Fresh SOA from ozonolysis of 10 to 40 ppb α-pinene was formed followed by aging with OH radicals. The particles' volatility and hygroscopicity (expressed as volume fraction remaining (VFR) and hygroscopicity parameter κ) were measured in parallel with a volatility and hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer (V/H-TDMA). An aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) {{was used for the}} chemical characterization of the aerosol. These measurements were used as sensitive parameters to reveal the mechanisms possibly responsible for the changes in the SOA composition during aging. A change of VFR and/or κ during processing of atmospheric aerosols may occur either by addition of SOA mass (by condensation) or by a change of SOA composition leading to different aerosol properties. The latter may occur either by heterogeneous reactions {{on the surface of the}} SOA particles, by condensed phase reactions like oligomerization or by an evaporation – gas-phase oxidation – recondensation cycle. The condensation mechanism showed to be dominant when there is a substantial change in the aerosol mass by addition of new molecules to the aerosol phase with time. Experiments could be divided into four periods based on the temporal evolution (qualitative changes) of VFR, κ and organic mass: O 3 induced condensation, ripening, and OH induced <b>chemical</b> <b>aging</b> first with substantial mass gain and then without significant mass gain. During the O 3 induced condensation the particles' volatility decreased (increasing VFR) while the hygroscopicity increased.

Only during Heinrich events 1 and 2, when the investigated core site off northwest Africa experienced year-round, sustained deposition of organic matter, the d 13 C values at this site faithfully record deep-water ventilation states. During times of predominantly seasonal deposition of fresh phytodetritus, however, d 13 C values were significantly lower than at the reference sites.

Methods: Based on HIFI and JCMT data, the molecular abundances of species found in the protostellar envelope of AFGL 2591 were derived with a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code (Ratran), assuming a mixture of constant and 1 D stepwise radial profiles for abundance distributions. The reconstructed 1 D abundances were compared {{with the results of}} the time-dependent gas-grain chemical modeling, using the best-fit 1 D power-law density structure. The chemical simulations were performed considering ages of 1 - 5 × 104 years, cosmic ray ionization rates of 5 - 500 × 10 - 17 s- 1, uniformly-sized 0. 1 - 1 μm dust grains, a dust/gas ratio of 1 %, and several sets of initial molecular abundances with C/O 1. The most important model parameters varied one by one in the simulations are age, cosmic ray ionization rate, external UV intensity, and grain size. Results: Constant abundance models give good fits to the data for CO, CN, CS, HCO+, H 2 CO, N 2 H+, CCH, NO, OCS, OH, H 2 CS, O, C, C+, and CH. Models with an abundance jump at 100 K give good fits to the data for NH 3, SO, SO 2, H 2 S, H 2 O, HCl, and CH 3 OH. For HCN and HNC, the best models have an abundance jump at 230 K. The time-dependent chemical model can accurately explain abundance profiles of 15 out of these 24 species. The jump-like radial profiles for key species like HCO+, NH 3, and H 2 O are consistent with the outcome of the time-dependent chemical modeling. The best-fit model has a <b>chemical</b> <b>age</b> of ~ 10 - 50 kyr, a solar C/O ratio of 0. 44, and a cosmic-ray ionization rate of ~ 5 × 10 - 17 s- 1.

Both single Moded Microstructured Polymer Optical Fiber (SM-MPOF) and Graded Index Microstructured Polymer Optical Fiber (GI-MPOF) has been studied for physical <b>ageing</b> and <b>chemical</b> degradation at elevated temperature in presence of humidification. An acceleration factor of approximately eight {{has been used to}} carry out accelerated ageing on specimen under test which is compatible to Australian winter environmental condition. Physical ageing exhibits hole expansion, defect in polymer side chain along hole and asymmetric hole expansion. <b>Chemical</b> <b>ageing</b> exhibits possibility of degradation product formation that is confirmed by observing peaks of different conformation functional groups (-OH,-CH,>CO/-COOH) involved in polymer chain in the both type fiber. Experimental data on <b>chemical</b> <b>ageing</b> satisfy good agreement with Arrhenius rate equation and that degradation products are likely to be accumulated in polymer matrix as sub molecular debris. Experimental data returns empirical correlation of durability versus ageing that manifests necessity of using cable sheath.

40|$|High {{levels of}} {{deuterium}} fraction in N_ 2 H^+ are observed in some pre-stellar cores. Single-zone chemical models {{find that the}} timescale required to reach observed values (D_ frac^ N_ 2 H^+≡ N_ 2 D^+/ N_ 2 H^+ ≳ 0. 1) is longer than the free-fall time, possibly ten times longer. Here, we explore the deuteration of turbulent, magnetized cores with 3 D magnetohydrodynamics simulations. We use an approximate chemical model to follow the growth in abundances of N_ 2 H^+ and N_ 2 D^+. We then examine {{the dynamics of the}} core using each tracer for comparison to observations. We find that the velocity dispersion of the core as traced by N_ 2 D^+ appears slightly sub-virial compared to predictions of the Turbulent Core Model of McKee & Tan, except at late times just before the onset of protostar formation. By varying the initial mass surface density, the magnetic energy, the <b>chemical</b> <b>age,</b> and the ortho-to-para ratio of H_ 2, we also determine the physical and temporal properties required for high deuteration. We find that low initial ortho-to-para ratios (≲ 0. 01) and/or multiple free-fall times (≳ 3) of prior chemical evolution are necessary to reach the observed values of deuterium fraction in pre-stellar cores.

40|$|Velocity {{profiles}} of ground state lines of H 2 D+, HC 18 O+ and N 2 H+, observed previously with the CSO and IRAM 30 m telescopes, are modeled with a Monte Carlo radiative transfer program {{to study the}} temperature, density and velocity structure of the pre-stellar core LDN 1544. The H 2 D+ line is double-peaked {{like that of the}} other ions, but previous models that fit the HC 18 O+ and N 2 H+ profiles are found not to fit the H 2 D+ data. Matching the H 2 D+ observations requires at least three modifications to the model at small radii: (1) the density profile must continue to rise inward and not flatten off toward the center; (2) the gas temperature must be nearly constant and not drop inwards significantly; (3) the infall velocity must increase inward, in a fashion intermediate between `quasi-static' (ambipolar diffusion) and `fully dynamic' (Larson-Penston) collapse. The C 18 O emission indicates a <b>chemical</b> <b>age</b> of <~ 0. 1 Myr. The effects of a flattened structure and rotation on the line profiles are shown to be unimportant, at least on the scales probed by single-dish telescopes. Alternatively, the H 2 D+ profile is affected by absorption in the outer layers of the core, if gas motions in these layers are sufficiently small.

40|$|We present {{submillimeter}} {{observations of}} SO, SO 2, H 2 S, H 2 CS, OCS, NS and HCS+ toward nine massive young stars. The outflow contributes ~ 50 % to the SO and SO 2 emission in 15 - 20 '' beams, more than for CS, {{where it is}} 10 %. The SO 2 abundance increases from dark cloud levels in the outer envelope (T 100 K). Molecular abundances are consistent with a model of ice evaporation in an envelope with gradients in temperature and density for a <b>chemical</b> <b>age</b> of ~ 30000 yr. The high observed abundance of OCS, the fact that T_ex (OCS) >> T_ex (H 2 S), and the data on solid OCS and H 2 S all suggest that the major sulphur carrier in grain mantles is OCS rather than H 2 S. For most other sulphur-bearing molecules, the source-to-source abundance variations by factors of up to 10 do not correlate with previously established evolutionary trends in temperature tracers. These species probe the chemically inactive outer envelope. Our data set does not constrain the abundances of H 2 S and SO in the inner envelope, which, together with SO 2, are required to use sulphur as a clock.

40|$|Thermoplastic {{composites}} using {{natural fibres}} are studied intensively and {{widely used in}} applications including automotive, packaging, consumer goods and construction. Good balance of mechanical properties, processability and low cost are great advantages of these materials {{on top of the}} environmental benefits. Recently, there have been various efforts to amplify the positive effects on the environment by replacing the conventional polymers by bio-derived renewable polymers in the composites. Recent studies conducted from our research group showed competitiveness of plant fibre-thermoplastic composites. Implementing the promising results and experience, a new composite design using renewable polyethylene as the matrix material was studied. This polyethylene is a renewable thermoplastic that was derived from sugar cane ethanol. The objectives of this study were to employ renewable high density polyethylene (HDPE) into composites using wheat straw and flax fibre to extend the range of properties of the HDPE while keeping the amount of renewable content to nearly 100 %. The chemical resistance of these materials has not been reported before and it was investigated here by measuring and comparing the properties before and after accelerated <b>chemical</b> <b>ageing.</b> Both wheat straw and flax fibre had two different grades in size. Each of them was compounded with HDPE and additives (antioxidant and coupling agent) in a co-rotating twin screw extruder. The concentrations of fibres were varied from 0 to 30 wt-%. Then, injection molded samples were prepared for measurement of properties: tensile, flexural, impact tests. The effects of reinforcing fibre size were studied first. Both length and aspect ratio were considered. For both types of fibre composites, a general trend was observed. There was no clear evidence of improvements in flexural (strength and modulus) and tensile (strength, percentage elongation at break) properties with respect to the change in fibre size. However, impact (IZOD impact strength, Gardner impact failure energy) properties showed some improvements. This result was due to no substantial difference in size and aspect ratios in post-processed fibres that were actually residing in the matrix. There were remarkable improvements in flexural strength and modulus when the fibre content increased. However, minor decreases in tensile properties were observed. Furthermore, the impact properties were very sensitive to the concentration of fibres. As the fibre concentration went up, there were significant decreases in both IZOD impact strength and Gardner impact failure energy. Chemical resistance of these composites was studied by exposing them in six different chemical solutions (hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, sodium hydroxide, ethyl alcohol, industrial detergent, water) for up to thirty days. The increase in weight and leaching behaviour was observed. As the fibre content increased within the composites, the weight gain was more rapid during <b>chemical</b> <b>ageing.</b> Because there were more fibres exposed on the surface after <b>chemical</b> <b>ageing,</b> it is likely that they contributed to the higher flux of liquids (used for <b>chemical</b> <b>ageing)</b> inside the sample. Among the physical properties, tensile properties were most susceptible to the <b>chemical</b> <b>ageing.</b> One possible reason could be due to the exposed surface area to volume ratio, which was the highest in tensile bars and therefore faster mass transfer taking place into the matrix per volume. Finally, morphological study using scanned electron spectroscopy (SEM) revealed the damage on the surface when exposed to the chemicals. The fibres on the surface had been leached out in the sodium hydroxide solution leaving empty spaces. The fractured surface was also monitored via SEM. Though there was not enough evidence of strong interfacial interactions between the fibre and the polymer, good dispersions were observed...|$|R
40|$|Carbonaceous {{aerosols}} including {{organic carbon}} and black carbon have significant implications for both climate and air quality. In the current global climate or chemical transport models, a fixed hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic conversion lifetime for carbonaceous aerosol (τ) is generally assumed, {{which is usually}} around one day. We have implemented a new detailed aging scheme for carbonaceous aerosols in a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to account for both the chemical oxidation and the physical condensation-coagulation effects, where τ is affected by local atmospheric environment including atmospheric concentrations of water vapor, ozone, hydroxyl radical and sulfuric acid. The updated τ exhibits large spatial and temporal variations with the global average (up to 11 km altitude) calculated to be 2. 6 days. The <b>chemical</b> <b>aging</b> effects {{are found to be}} strongest over the tropical regions driven by the low ozone concentrations and high humidity there. The τ resulted from <b>chemical</b> <b>aging</b> generally decreases with altitude due to increases in ozone concentration and decreases in humidity. The condensation-coagulation effects are found to be most important for the high-latitude areas, in particular the polar regions, where the τ values are calculated to be up to 15 days. When both the <b>chemical</b> <b>aging</b> and condensation-coagulation effects are considered, the total atmospheric burdens and global average lifetimes of BC, black carbon, (OC, organic carbon) are calculated to increase by 9 % (3 %) compared to the control simulation, with considerable enhancements of BC and OC concentrations in the Southern Hemisphere. Model evaluations against data from multiple datasets show that the updated aging scheme improves model simulations of carbonaceous aerosols for some regions, especially for the remote areas in the Northern Hemisphere. The improvement helps explain the persistent low model bias for carbonaceous aerosols in the Northern Hemisphere reported in literature. Further model sensitivity simulations focusing on the continental outflow of carbonaceous aerosols demonstrate that previous studies using the old aging scheme could have significantly underestimated the intercontinental transport of carbonaceous aerosols...|$|R
