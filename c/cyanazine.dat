40|$|A {{recently}} developed analytical method using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry {{was used to}} investigate the occurrence of <b>cyanazine</b> and its degradates <b>cyanazine</b> acid (CAC), <b>cyanazine</b> amide (CAM), deethylcyanazine (DEC), and deethylcyanazine acid (DCAC) in groundwater. This research represents {{some of the earliest}} data on the occurrence of <b>cyanazine</b> degradates in groundwater. Although <b>cyanazine</b> was infrequently detected in the 64 wells across Iowa sampled in 1999, <b>cyanazine</b> degradates were commonly found during this study. The most frequently detected <b>cyanazine</b> compound was DCAC (32. 8 %) followed by CAC (29. 7 %), CAM (17. 2 %), DEC (3. 1 %), and <b>cyanazine</b> (3. 1 %). The frequency of detection for <b>cyanazine</b> or one or more of its degradates (CYTOT) was more than 12 -fold over that of <b>cyanazine</b> alone (39. 1 % for CYTOT versus 3. 1 % for <b>cyanazine).</b> Of the total measured concentration of <b>cyanazine,</b> only 0. 2 % was derived from its parent compounds with DCAC (74. 1 %) and CAC (18. 4 %) comprising 92. 5 % of this total. Thus, although DCAC and CAC had similar frequencies of detection, DCAC was generally present in higher concentrations. No concentrations of <b>cyanazine</b> compounds for this study exceeded water-quality criteria for the protection of human health. Only <b>cyanazine,</b> however, has such a criteria established. Nevertheless, because these <b>cyanazine</b> degradates are still chlorinated, they may have similar toxicity as their parent compounds similar to what has been found with the chlorinated degradates of atrazine. Thus, {{the results of this study}} documented that data on the degradates for <b>cyanazine</b> are critical for understanding its fate and transport in the hydrologic system. Furthermore, the prevalence of the chlorinated degradates of <b>cyanazine</b> found in groundwater suggests that to accurately determine the overall effect on human health and the environment from <b>cyanazine</b> its degradates should also be considered. In addition, because CYTOT was found in 57. 6 % of the samples collected from alluvial aquifers, about 2 - 5 times more frequently than the other major aquifer types (glacial drift, bedrock/karst, bedrock/ nonkarst) under investigation, this finding has long-term implications for the occurrence of CYTOT in streams. It is anticipated that low-level concentrations of CYTOT will continue to be detected in streams for years after the use of <b>cyanazine</b> has terminated (scheduled for the year 2000 in the United States), primarily through its movement from groundwater into streams during base-flow conditions...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Cyanazine</b> is {{a common}} {{pesticide}} used frequently in the United States during the 1980 s and 1990 s. Animal and human {{studies have suggested that}} triazines may be carcinogenic, but results have been mixed. We evaluated cancer incidence in cyanazine-exposed pesticide applicators among the 57, 311 licensed pesticide applicators in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS). METHODS: We obtained detailed pesticide exposure information from a self-administered questionnaire completed at enrollment (1993 – 1997). Cancer incidence was followed through January 2002. Over half of cyanazine-exposed applicators had ≥ 6 years of exposure at enrollment, and approximately 85 % had begun using <b>cyanazine</b> before the 1990 s. We used adjusted Poisson regression to calculate rate ratios (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of multiple cancer sites among cyanazine-exposed applicators. We calculated ptrend values, and all statistical tests were twosided. Two exposure metrics were used: tertiles of lifetime days of exposure (LD) and intensityweighted LD. RESULTS: A total of 20, 824 cancer-free AHS applicators reported ever using <b>cyanazine</b> at enrollment.

A {{standard}} Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) filter paper {{test was used to}} assess the acute toxicity of chlorpyrifos, atrazine, <b>cyanazine,</b> and simazine to the earthworm Eisenia fetida. Acute toxicity of chlorpyrifos was also determined in combination with the three-triazine herbicides. Surprisingly, atrazine and <b>cyanazine</b> caused mortality at concentrations lower than chlorpyrifos. Atrazine and <b>cyanazine</b> also increased the toxicity of chlorpyrifos 7. 9 - and 2. 2 -fold, respectively. However, simazine caused no toxicity to the worms and did not affect chlorpyrifos toxicity in binary mixture experiments. Possible mechanisms for the greater-than-additive toxicity for the binary combinations of atrazine and <b>cyanazine</b> with chlorpyrifos were investigated, including changes in uptake and biotransformation rates of chlorpyrifos in the presence of atrazine. Uptake of chlorpyrifos into the worms decreased slightly when atrazine was present in the system, therefore eliminating increased uptake as a possible explanation for the increased toxicity. Body residue analysis of worms indicated increased metabolite formation, suggesting the greater-than-additive response may be due to increased biotransformation to more toxic oxon metabolites. peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that degradation of pesticides in simple laboratory systems may differ from that in the field, {{but it is not}} clear which of the simplifications inherent in laboratory studies present serious shortcomings. Laboratory experiments evaluated several simplifying assumptions for a clay loam soil and contrasting pesticides. Degradation of <b>cyanazine</b> [2 -(4 -chloro- 6 -ethylamino- 1, 3, 5 -triazin- 2 -ylamino) 2 -methylpropiononitrile] and bentazone [3 -isopropyl- 1 H- 2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazin- 4 (3 H) -one 2, 2 -dioxide] at fluctuating temperature and moisture was predicted reasonably well based on parameters derived from degradation under constant conditions. There was a tendency for slower degradation of <b>cyanazine</b> and bentazone in soil aggregates of 3 to 5 mm in diameter (DT 50 at 15 degrees C and 40 % maximum water holding capacity of 25. 1 and 58. 2 d, where DT 50 is the time for 50 % decline of the initial pesticide concentration) than in soil sieved to < 3 mm (DT 50 of 19. 1 and 37. 6 d), but the differences were not significant for most datasets. Degradation of <b>cyanazine,</b> isoproturon [3 (4 -isopropylphenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea], and chlorotoluron [3 -(3 -chloro-p-tolyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea] was measured in soil amended with different amounts of lignin. The effect of lignin on degradation was small despite considerable differences in sorption. The DT 50 values of <b>cyanazine,</b> isoproturon, and chlorotoluron were 16. 2, 18. 6, and 33. 0 d, respectively, in soil without lignin and 19. 0, 23. 4, and 34. 6 d, respectively, in soil amended with 2 % lignin. Degradation of bentazone and <b>cyanazine</b> in repacked soil columns was similar under static and flow conditions with 50. 1 and 47. 2 % of applied bentazone and 74. 7 and 73. 6 % of applied <b>cyanazine,</b> respectively, degraded within 20 d of application.

40|$|Abstract—Amphibian species inhabiting {{agricultural}} areas may {{be exposed to}} pesticides during their aquatic larval phase. We tested the toxicity of six commonly used pesticides on Rana temporaria spawn and tadpoles. In acute tests, tadpoles were exposed to relatively high concentrations of azoxystrobin, <b>cyanazine,</b> esfenvalerate, MCPA ([4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenoxy] acetic acid), per-methrin, and pirimicarb for 72 h. Chronic exposure tests were performed from fertilization to metamorphosis with azoxystrobin, <b>cyanazine,</b> and permethrin at concentrations {{similar to those found}} in surface waters in {{agricultural areas}} in Sweden. The most lethal pesticides in the acute exposure were azoxystrobin, permethrin, and pirimicarb. Also, negative effects on the growth of the tadpoles were observed with azoxystrobin, <b>cyanazine,</b> and permethrin. The chronic exposure at lower pesticide concentrations did not result in increased mortality or impaired growth. However, we found a positive effect of permethrin on growth and size at metamorphosis.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of trace quantities of commonly-detected herbicides and herbicide degradates {{was investigated in}} a shallow sand and gravel aquifer. Two injection studies were conducted, including low concentrations (∼MCL) of the herbicides atrazine, alachlor, <b>cyanazine,</b> metolachlor, butachlor, and the triazine degradates deethylatrazine (DEA) and deisopropylatrazine (DIA), along with a conservative tracer (bromide). The plumes were monitored for 2 to 3 months following injection using an array of multilevel samplers. ^ Advection-dispersion and exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) equations were fitted to breakthrough curves to determine transport parameters. Comparison of the breakthrough curves for the conservative tracer and each herbicide provides a measure of retardation in the aquifer. A retardation factor (R) may be calculated from the first central moment of the data or from peak parameters obtained from the fitted curves. Results indicated only slight retention of all injected compounds. Retardation factors for atrazine, DEA, DIA, <b>cyanazine,</b> alachlor, and metolachlor were less than 1. 3, with butachlor being slightly more retained (R 3 ̆e 1. 6).

The trials showed that scallion crops could tolerate certain post-emergence herbicides better than weed populations earlier in their life cycle provided the first true leaf of the crop had reached 1. 5 - 2 cm in length. Various combinations or cocktails of herbicides of <b>cyanazine,</b> oxyfourfen, ioxynil and gesagard were tested both at Kinsealy and in several commercial locations in Co. Dublin at very low rates varying from 17 to 70 g/ha and these were compared with current standard post-emergence recommendation of single rate ioxynil at 0. 4 - 0. 7 kg/ha. Each of the cocktail combinations apart from ioxynil and <b>cyanazine</b> produced highly satisfactory weed control when repeated at 7 - 12 day intervals commencing when the first true leaf averaged 2 cms long, over a wide range of conditions.

A major concern is how exposure to combinations of low levels of pesticides, especially herbicides, could affect public health. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine the clastogenic potential of herbicide interaction on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The cells were exposed to atrazine, simazine, <b>cyanazine,</b> and all possible combinations of these chemicals for 48 hr. Two concentrations were used for each sample: the U. S. EPA maximum contamination level (MCL) and the highest contamination level found in Illinois water supplies. Nuclei were isolated from the cells and analyzed by flow cytometry. The effects of clastogenicity were measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) of the G 1 peak of whole cells and the change in CV of the largest chromosome in the flow karyotype. At both levels tested, atrazine caused chromosomal damage to the CHO cells. Simazine was observed to induce whole-cell clastogenicity but not flow karyotype damage. <b>Cyanazine</b> did not induce any measurable chromosomal damage in either analysis.

Our objective was to characterize and remediate the contaminated site by a combined chemical-biological approach. This was accomplished by creating contour maps of the on-site contamination, placing the top 60 cm of contaminated soil in windrows and mixing with a mechanical high-speed mixer. Homogenized soil containing both atrazine [6 -chloro-N-ethyl-N´-isopropyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazine- 2, 4 -diamine] and <b>cyanazine</b> { 2 -[[4 -chloro- 6 -(ethylamino) - 1, 3, 5 - triazin- 2 -yl] amino]- 2 -methylpropanenitrile} was then used in laboratory investigations to determine optimum treatments for pesticide destruction. Iron suspension experiments verified that zerovalent iron (Fe 0) plus ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4 • 7 H 2 O) removed more than 90 % of both atrazine and <b>cyanazine</b> within 14 days. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/ MS) analysis of the atrazine solution after treating with Fe 0 and ferrous sulfate identified several degradation products commonly associated with biodegradation (i. e., deethlyatrazine (DEA), deisopropylatrazine (DIA), hydroxyatrazine (HA), and ammelines). Biological treatment evaluated emulsified soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] oil (EOS) as a carbon source to stimulate biodegradation in static soil microcosms. Combining emulsified soybean oil with the chemical amendments resulted in higher destruction efficiencies (80 – 85 %) and reduced the percentage of FeSO 4 needed.

A source area of 0. 41 ha (mainly Canisteo {{silty clay loam}} soil), having an average slope of 3 %, was fall chisel-plowed, spring disked, and planted to corn. Three herbicides (atrazine, metolachlor, and <b>cyanazine)</b> were applied to the source area in each spring. Six vegetative buffer strips, 1. 52 m wide ¥ 20. 12 m long, were isolated with metal borders downslope of the source area in a well established bromegrass (Bromus inermis) waterway. These strips provided for three replications of two drainage to buffer area ratio treatments of 15 : 1 and 30 : 1. Herbicide retention was dependent on the antecedent moisture conditions of the strips. These retentions ranged from 11 to 100 % for atrazine, 16 to 100 % for metolachlor, and 8 to 100 % for <b>cyanazine.</b> Herbicide retention by the buffer strips for the two treatments {{were not significantly different}} for the observed storm events. Herbicide concentrations in solution in outflow from the strips were less than the inflow concentrations for all the three herbicides.

Experiments were set up as a split plot design with three replications on each farm. Tillage was the main plot (Conservation Tillage (CT), Conventional Tillage (CONV)) and weeding option (hand weeding, <b>cyanazine,</b> atrazine, glyphosate only and mixture of <b>cyanazine</b> + alachlor and atrazine + alachlor) as the sub-plots. Due to the heterogeneous nature of farmers' resource base, the farms were grouped into three farm types: high (Type 1), medium (Type 2) and poorly resourced farmers (Type 3). The hand hoe weeded treatments had 49 percent higher total weed densities in CT relative to CONV, and was statistically similar to the glyphosate treatment. The mixed pre-emergence herbicides reduced the diversity indices by 69 and 70 percent {{when compared to the}} hand hoe weeded treatment under CT in cotton and maize, respectively. The effectiveness of all pre-emergence herbicides were not influenced by tillage but were affected by farmers resource endowments with pronounced effect in Farm Type 1. Maximum plant heights of 85 and 238 cm were recorded for mixed pre-emergence herbicides under CT for cotton and maize, respectively. Minimum plant heights of 75 and 217 cm were recorded for the respective hand hoe weeded treatments. The hand hoe weeded treatments resulted in average cotton lint yield of 1497 and 2018 kg ha− 1 for maize. The mixed pre-emergence herbicides treatments gave yields of 2138 and 2356 kg ha− 1 of cotton and maize, respectively. The higher weed densities in CT under hand weeded treatments underscored the need for other weeding options.

40|$|A aplicação de herbicidas em pósemergência inicial e em pós-emergência dirigida pode causar injúrias às plantas de milho, quando estas são atingidas por produtos não totalmente seletivos. Como esses herbicidas são basicamente bloqueadores de processos metabólicos, surge a dúvida de quais serão os efeitos dessas injúrias na produção final de grãos de milho. Assim, o objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar o efeito da fitotoxidade causada pela aplicação de herbicidas na fase inicial e na pós-emergência tardia da cultura e o seu efeito na produção de grãos. Foi utilizado o híbrido BRS 3123, em 12 tratamentos repetidos 4 vezes. Esses tratamentos consistiram da aplicação dos seguintes herbicidas: <b>cyanazine</b> + {{simazine}} + assist, aplicados nos estádios de crescimentos de 4 e 6 folhas e paraquat + extravon e ametryn + assist, aplicados no estádio de 12 folhas, em jato dirigido. Foram incluídos também testemunhas com e sem capinas, além dos tratamentos com retirada mecânica das folhas do 1 o e do 1 o ao 3 o pares de folha. Foram avaliados: área foliar, matéria seca, teor de clorofila nas folhas, altura da planta e da inserção de espigas, diâmetro do colmo, índice de espigas, peso de 1000 grãos e produção de grãos. Observou-se que no no primeiro ano agrícola (94 / 95), as variáveis de crescimento não foram afetadas pelos tratamentos, ao passo que no ano seguinte, o melhor desenvolvimento das plantas foi obtido com a aplicação de <b>cyanazine</b> + simazine, enquanto que paraquat + extravon, ametryn + assist e testemunha sem capina, (devido ao efeito de matocompetição), resultaram nos piores tratamentos até a floração do milho. A maior produção de espigas e grãos no primeiro ano foi obtida com o tratamento <b>cyanazine</b> + simazine + assist, enquanto que, no segundo ano, paraquat + extravon e ametryn + assist proporcionaram as maiores produções, apesar das injúrias observadas na área foliar. Herbicide application at post emergence stage {{may cause}} injuries to maize plants, when these plants are reached randomly by non selective products. Since these herbicides act basically blocking metabolic processes, the question {{which has been}} raised is concerned what are the effects that these injuries {{will result in the}} grain production. Therefore the objective of this work was to study the phytotoxic effects caused by the application of herbicides at the initial phase and at late post emergency stage of the crop and its effect in the grain production. It was used the hybrid BRS 3123, with 12 treatments in 4 replications. These treatments were performed by the combination of the application of the following herbicides: <b>cyanazine</b> + simazine with or without Assist, applied at growth stages of 4 and 6 corn leaves; paraquat + extravon and ametryn + Assist, applied as directed spray at the growth stage of 12 leaves. In addition, it was included the treatment with and without hoeing and the defoliation of first and third pair of leaves at the 12 leaf stage. It was evaluated: leaf area, dry matter, chlorophyl content in the leaves, plant height, ear height, ear index, weight of ears and grains. The first year (1994 / 95) the variables of growth were not affected by the treatments, whereas at the following year (1995 / 96), the best development of plants was obtained by the application of <b>cyanazine</b> + simazine, and the worst treatments were paraquat + extravon, ametryn + assist and the plot without hoeing. The greater production of ears and grains at first year came from the treatment <b>cyanazine</b> + simazine + assist, whereas in the second year, paraquat + extravon and ametryn + Assist resulted in the best yield. Application of herbicides in post emergence at the initial phase of the crop, besides providing a good weed control, did not affect the development of maize plant...|$|E

40|$|Abscisic acid (ABA) {{was shown}} to reduce the {{photosynthetic}} capacity of a leaf through an apparent inhibition of ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase (RuBPCase) activity, in addition to promoting stomatal closure. By comparison {{with the effects of}} other inhibitors of photosynthesis (<b>cyanazine,</b> methyl viologen, sodium azide, nigericin, sodium cyanide) on whole leaf photosynthesis, RuBPCase activity and metabolite pool sizes, it was demonstrated that the biochemical basis for the apparent effect of ABA on RuBPCase activity was not the result of reduced substrate availability, decarbamylation of the enzyme, or synthesis of carboxyarabinitol 1 -phosphate, the naturally occurring tight-binding inhibitor of the enzyme. An inhibition of photosynthetic capacity showing the same biochemical characteristics as ABA-fed leaves was observed in plants grown under saline conditions. We suggest that the common link between environmental stress and reductions in photosynthetic capacity may be ABA. We hypothesize that ABA may affect plasma membrane function and thus indirectly RuBPCase activity through altered ion fluxes. The results of feeding <b>cyanazine,</b> methyl viologen, and nigericin provide additional evidence that regulation of RuBPCase activity by carbamylation/decarbamylation is related {{to the extent to which}} the capacity for ATP formation limits photosynthesis...|$|E

During high streamflow in March 1990, alachlor, atrazine, and metolachlor were detected at concentrations above background in water from wells as distant as 20, 50, and 10 m from the river’s edge, respectively. During high streamflow in May 1990, alachlor, atrazine, <b>cyanazine,</b> and metolachlor were detected at concentrations above background as distant as 20, 50, 10, and 20 m from the river’s edge, respectively. Herbicide bank storage took place during high streamflow when hydraulic gradients were from the river to the alluvial aquifer and the laterally infiltrating river water contained herbicide concentrations larger than background concentrations in the aquifer. The herbicide bank storage can be quantified by multiplying herbicide concentration by the “effective area” that a well represented and an assumed porosity of 0. 25.

40|$|Con el objetivo de integrar diferentes prácticas culturales en un sistema de control de malezas en maíz, se instaló un ensayo en el Campo Experimental de la Universidad Autónoma Chapingo (México) (2250 msnm, precipitación media anual 550 mm, suelo franco, 1. 7 % M. O.) bajo condiciones de secano, en donde se evaluaron dos densidades (44. 400 y 66. 600 pl/ha), dos distribuciones (normal y equidistante) y siete métodos de control de malezas (<b>cyanazine</b> + {{alachlor}} (1, 2 + 1, 92 kg/ha), atrazine + alachlor (1, 2 + 1, 44 kg/ha), un escarda, dos escardas, testigo siempre desmalezado, testigo siempre desmalezado + dos escardas y testigo siempre enmalezado). Las principales malezas presentes fueron: quelite (Amaranthus sp.), perlilla (Lopezia mexicana Jacq.), rosilla chita (Galinsoga parviflora Cav.), acahual (Encelia mexicana Mart.), Sporobulus poiretti (Roem, et Sch.) Hichc. y fresadilla (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.). El aumento de la densidad de siembra no se reflejó en el control de malezas, incidencia de enfermedades, crescimiento vegetativo y reproductivo del cultivo. La distribución equidistante aparejó un mejor control de malezas, en relación a la distribución normal, pero la incidencia de enfermedades fue mayor, lo que quizá pudo haber determinado la ausencia de diferencias en crecimiento vegetativo, un menor número de mazorcas/ha y consecuentemente la ausencia de respuesta en rendimiento de grano. De los tratamientos químicos, atrazine + alachlor tuvo un comportamiento superior a <b>cyanazine</b> + alachlor, en control de malezas, aunque sólo fue detectable estadisticamente en las evaluaciones. No hubo diferencia entre ambos en la incidencia de enfermedades, ni en su efecto sobre el cultivo. aunque el rendimiento de <b>cyanazine</b> + alachlor fue ligeramente inferior. Los métodos químicos fueron superiores a los mecánicos en control de malezas, pero no difirie -ron en la incidencia de enfermedades ni en los parámetros de desarrollo del cultivo. La realización de una escarda adicional no mejora significativamente el control de malezas, no afectando tampoco la incidencia de enfermedades, ni el desarrollo del cultivo, por lo cual resulta innecesaria. Las escardas tienen como principal efecto eliminar la interfe rencia presentada por las malezas y si éstas son eliminadas de otra manera, la realización de aquéllas no apareja beneficios significativos. An {{experiment was}} conducted at the Research Station of the University of Chapingo (Mexico) (2250 m above sea level, average annual rainfall 550 mm(loamy soil, 1, 7 % O. M.), where different cultural practices were combined in order to design a weed control system for corn. The work was done under rainfed conditions and the variables included were: two population densities (44. 400 and 66. 600 pl/ha), two plant distributions (normal and equidistant) and seven weed control methods (<b>cyanazine</b> + alachlor (1, 2 + 1, 92 kg/ha), atrazine + alachlor (1, 2 + 1, 44 kg/ha), one cultivation, two cultivations, a weeded check, a weeded check + two cultivations and a weedy check). The main weed species were: pigweed (Amaranthus sp.), Lopezia mexicana Jacq., hairy galinsoga (Galin-soga parviflora Cay.), Encelia mexicana Mart., Sporobulus poiretti (Roem. et Sch.) Hich., and large crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.). The increase in plant population {{had no effect on}} the degree of weed control, incidence of diseases and crop growth. The equidistant distribution improved weed control over the normal one, but it also had a nigher incidence of diseases; this, is turn, may have caused the lack of differences in vegetative growth, a lower amount of cobs per ha and the lack of difference in grain yield between the two distributions. Atrazine + alachlor was better than <b>cyanazine</b> + alachlor in terms of weed control, although the difference was statistically observed only for the visual ratings. There were no differences between both chemical treatments in terms of incidence of diseases or their effect on crop growth, but grain yield for <b>cyanazine</b> + alachlor was slightly lower. The chemical methods were better than the mechanical ones regarding weed control, but no differences were detected in terms of in cidence of diseases or crop growth. One additional weeding does not improved weed control significantly, nor does it affect the incidence of diseases or crop growth, thus appearing to be unnecessary. The main effect of cultivations is weed control, and if this can be done in any other way, cultivating does not bring about additional benefits...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring and {{analysis}} of trace contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides require {{the preservation of the}} samples before they can be quantified using the appropriate analytical methods. Our objective is to determine the sample shelf life to insure proper quantification of ultratrace contaminants. To this end, we tested the stability of a variety of pharmaceutical products including caffeine, natural steroids, and selected pesticides under refrigerated storage conditions. The analysis was performed using multi-residue methods using an on-line solid-phase extraction combined with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) in the selected reaction monitoring mode. After 21 days of storage, {{no significant difference in the}} recoveries was observed compared to day 0 for pharmaceutical products, while for pesticides, significant losses occurred for DIA and simazine after 10 days (14 % and 17 % reduction respectively) and a statistically significant decrease in the recovery was noted for <b>cyanazine</b> (78 % disappearance). However, the estrogen and progestogen steroids were unstable during storage. The disappearance rates obtained after 21 days of storage vary from 63 to 72 % for the feminizing hormones. Overall, pharmaceuticals and pesticides seem to be stable for refrigerated storage for up to about 10 days (except <b>cyanazine)</b> and steroidal hormones can be quite sensitive to degradation and should not be stored for more than a few days...|$|E
