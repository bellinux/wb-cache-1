The Registrar works with a Joint Advisory Committee (JAC) in developing and implementing the standard.

2500|$|Prior to Unicode, {{support for}} sampi in {{electronic}} encoding was marginal. No common 8-bit codepage for Greek (such as ISO 8859-7) contained sampi. However, lowercase and uppercase sampi were provided {{for by the}} [...] Greek alphabet <b>coded</b> <b>character</b> <b>set</b> for bibliographic information interchange. In Beta code, lowercase and uppercase sampi are encoded as [...] "#5" [...] and [...] "*#5" [...] respectively. In the LaTeX typesetting system, the [...] "Babel" [...] package allows accessing lowercase and uppercase sampi through the commands [...] "\sampi" [...] and [...] "\Sampi". Non-Unicode (8-bit) fonts for polytonic Greek sometimes contained sampi mapped to arbitrary positions, but usually not as a casing pair. For instance, the [...] "WP Greek Century" [...] font that came with WordPerfect had sampi encoded as 0xFC, while the popular [...] "Wingreek" [...] fonts had it encoded as 0x22. No encoding system prior to Unicode 5.1 catered for archaic epigraphic sampi separately.|$|E
