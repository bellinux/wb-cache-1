40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is the {{determination}} of solar minimum date of the new sunspot <b>cycle</b> <b>No</b> 24. It is provided by using of four types of mean daily data values for the period Jan 01. 2006 - Dec 31. 2009 : (1) the solar radioindex F 10. 7; (2) the International sunspot number Ri; (3) the total solar irradiance index (TSI), and (4) the daily number of X-ray flares of classes from "B" to "X" from the soft X-ray GOES satellite channel (0. 1 - 0. 8 nm). It is found that the mean starting moment of the upward solar activity tendency (the mean solar minimum) is Nov. 06 th, 2008. So, the solar <b>cycle</b> <b>No</b> 23 length is estimated to 12. 6 years. A conclusion for a relatively weak general magnitude of solar <b>cycle</b> <b>No</b> 24 is made.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{variation}} in the magnetic field strength and the umbral intensity of sunspots during the declining phase of the solar <b>cycle</b> <b>no.</b> 23 and {{in the beginning of}} <b>cycle</b> <b>no.</b> 24. We analyze a sample of 183 sunspots observed from 1999 until 2011 with the Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope. The magnetic field strength is derived from the Zeeman splitting of the Stokes-V signal in one near-infrared spectral line, either Fe I 1564. 8 nm, Fe I 1089. 6 nm, or Si I 1082. 7 nm. This avoids the effects of the unpolarized stray light from the field-free quiet Sun surroundings. The minimum umbral continuum intensity and umbral area are also measured. We find that there is a systematic trend for sunspots in the late stage of the solar <b>cycle</b> <b>no.</b> 23 to be weaker, i. e., to have a smaller maximum magnetic field strength than those {{at the start of the}} cycle. The decrease in the field strength with time of about 94 G/yr is well beyond the statistical fluctuations that would be expected because of the larger number of sunspots close to cycle maximum (14 G/yr). In the same time interval, the continuum intensity of the umbra increases with a rate of 1. 3 (+- 0. 4) % of Ic/yr, while the umbral area does not show any trend above the statistical variance. Sunspots in the new <b>cycle</b> <b>no.</b> 24 show higher field strengths and lower continuum intensities than those at the end of <b>cycle</b> <b>no.</b> 23, interrupting the trend. Sunspots have an intrinsically weaker field strength and brighter umbrae at the late stages of solar cycles compared to their initial stages, without any significant change in their area. The abrupt increase in field strength in sunspots of the new cycle suggests that the cyclic variations are dominating over any long-term trend that continues across cycles. We find a slight decrease in field strength and an increase in intensity as a long-term trend across the cycles. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, accepted in A&...|$|R

40|$|In {{the half}} of nineties we {{prepared}} a prediction of solar activity in <b>cycles</b> <b>No</b> 23 to 26. For this prediction we used the data from 1500 - 1995 representing 10 significant period lengths with lowest p-values. Using the superposition of these sine waves the data of 1500 - 1995 were excellently fitted. The prediction for 1996 - 2040 was constructed as an extrapolatlon of this course. We predicted that <b>cycles</b> <b>No</b> 23 and 24 wtll be longer {{and the value of}} sunspot numbers in the maximum will be lower than that in the cycle No 22. These predictions have been so far roughly fulfilled, except only the maximum of the 23 rd cycle appeared in reality a little earlier. This is why the descending part of the 23 rd cycle observations found itself closely under the 957 o tolerance corridor of our prediction. Using now the data since 1500 till 2010 and the same prediction method we prepared anew prediction for the <b>cycles</b> <b>No</b> 24 and 25.
