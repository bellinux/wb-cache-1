40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to assess the ability of subsurface flow wetlands, with aeration and vegetation, to remove nitrogen in cold weather climates. Aeration was shown to enhance the wetland cell 2 ̆ 7 s ability to remove not only nitrogen but also CBOD, COD, and phosphorus (retention) more effectively. There was a significant difference (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in both total nitrogen and ammonia effluent concentrations comparing aerated to unaerated wetland cells, while no significance was found comparing planted and unplanted wetland cells. The effluent ammonia concentrations from the aerated wetland <b>cells</b> <b>ranged</b> from 2. 7 to 5. 7 mg N/L, while for unaerated <b>cells</b> effluent concentration <b>ranged</b> from 22 to 23 mg N/L. The effluent total nitrogen concentrations from the aerated wetland <b>cells</b> <b>ranged</b> from 9. 0 to 12 mg N/L, while those from unaerated <b>cells</b> <b>ranged</b> from 23 to 24 mg N/L. The effluent concentrations showed no significant difference (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) when comparing results of three temperature ranges.

30|$|The {{extension}} of the small cell size is achieved by selecting appropriate cell individual offset values for the handover measurements {{that are used to}} trigger the handover between radio cells. In the following, a <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion of x dB corresponds to a handover that is triggered when the UE receive signal strength of the macro cell is x dB higher than the signal strength of the micro cell. The overall system performance is very dependent on the <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion (CRE) parameter since this defines the load distribution between a macro cell and the underlying small cells. Since the load situation is very dependent on the location of the small cell and is varying heavily over time, a dynamic adaptation of the <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion is an attractive solution to optimise the overall system performance.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{heterogeneous}} networks {{is on the}} increase, {{fueled by}} consumer demand for more data. The main objective of heterogeneous networks is to increase capacity. They offer solutions for efficient use of spectrum, load balancing and improvement of cell edge coverage amongst others. However, these solutions have inherent challenges such as inter-cell interference and poor mobility management. In heterogeneous networks there is transmit power disparity between macro cell and pico cell tiers, which causes load imbalance between the tiers. Due to the conventional user-cell association strategy, whereby users associate to a base station with the strongest received signal strength, few users associate to small cells compared to macro cells. To counter the effects of transmit power disparity, <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion is used instead of the conventional strategy. The focus of our work is on load balancing using <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion (CRE) and network utility optimization techniques to ensure fair sharing of load in a macro and pico cell LTE Advanced heterogeneous network. The aim is to investigate how to use an adaptive <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion bias to optimize Pico cell coverage for load balancing. Reviewed literature points out several approaches to solve the load balancing problem in heterogeneous networks, which include, <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion and utility function optimization. Then, we use <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion, and logarithmic utility functions to design a load balancing algorithm. In the algorithm, user and base station associations are optimized by adapting CRE bias to pico base station load status. A price update mechanism based on a suboptimal solution of a network utility optimization problem is used to adapt the CRE bias. The price {{is derived from the}} load status of each pico base station. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by means of an LTE MATLAB toolbox. Simulations were conducted according to 3 GPP and ITU guidelines for modelling heterogeneous networks and propagation environment respectively. Compared to a static CRE configuration, the algorithm achieved more fairness in load distribution. Further, it achieved a better trade-off between cell edge and cell centre user throughputs.

30|$|In [1], {{the authors}} discuss <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> {{expansion}} (CRE), {{which is a}} technique that adds a bias value to pico received power from PBSs during the handover as if pico <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> is expanded, and many studies focus on this topic [1, 3 – 9]. CRE can make more UEs to access the PBS even if the macro received power is stronger than the pico received power. However, those UEs that access the PBS whose pico received power is weaker than the macro received power are affected by {{a large amount of}} interference from MBS; such UEs are referred to as expanded region (ER) UEs [1]. Therefore, whenever CRE is used, inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) may be needed so as to eliminate the interference.|$|R
40|$|Summary The {{frequency}} of {{sister chromatid exchange}} (SCE) was measured in peripheral blood lymphocytes from control, healthy subjects and immunosuppressed recipients of cadaveric donor kidneys with and without skin cancer. The mean SCE frequency in 43 control subjects was 9. 2 per <b>cell</b> (<b>range</b> 5. 4 - 12. 3). In 30 transplant recipients with no history or evidence of cancer the mean SCE rate was 10. 3 per <b>cell</b> (<b>range</b> 5. 8 - 24. 5); four (13 %) of these patients had a mean SCE frequency outside the control range. In 7 transplant recipients with skin cancer, the mean SCE frequency was 14. 3 per <b>cell</b> (<b>range</b> 9. 1 - 19. 9). This was significantly (P< 0. 01) higher than the mean value of control subjects. The mean SCE frequencies in 3 of these 7 patients fell within the control range and in 4 of these patients was above the control range. These results suggest that some immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients are liable to chromosomal damage. An increased incidence of cancer is well recognized in renal transplant recipients (Penn, 1979; Sheil et al., 1981).

50|$|Haloterrigena turkmenica is a gram-negative organism. Cells are {{typically}} found as individuals, {{but have been}} seen in the form of pairs and tetrads.

40|$|In {{diabetic}} patients, elevated plasma {{levels of}} t-PA and PAI- 1 accompany impaired fibrinolysis. To identify mechanisms for these abnormalities, we examined whether vascular endothelial cells exposed to high glucose upregulate t-PA and PAI- 1 production and whether ambient PA activity is decreased concomitantly. In 17 cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells grown to confluency in 30 mM glucose, the t-PA antigen {{released to the}} medium in 24 h was (median) 52 ng/ 106 <b>cells</b> (<b>range</b> 10 - 384) and the PAI- 1 antigen was 872 ng/ 106 <b>cells</b> (<b>range</b> 217 - 2074) -both greater (P < 0. 02) than the amounts released by paired control cultures grown in 5 mM glucose- 29 ng/ 106 <b>cells</b> (<b>range</b> 7. 5 - 216) and 461 ng/ 106 <b>cells</b> (<b>range</b> 230 - 3215), respectively. In the presence of high glucose, the steady-state levels of t- PA and PAI- 1 mRNAs were increased correspondingly (median 142 and 183 % of control, respectively, P < 0. 05); high glucose per se and hypertonicity contributed to the upregulation in additive fashion. The PA activity of conditioned medium from cultures exposed to high glucose was 0. 4 IU/ml (range 0. 2 - 0. 6), which was significantly lower (P < 0. 02) than the PA activity of control medium (0. 5 IU/ml, range 0. 2 - 0. 9). No difference was observed when comparing the PA activities of acidified conditioned media, expected to be depleted of inhibitors. Thus, high glucose coordinately upregulates endothelial t-PA and PAI- 1 expression through effects exerted at the pretranslational level and enhanced by even mild degrees of hypertonicity. The decrease in ambient fibrinolytic potential may reflect an overwhelming effect of the increased availability of PAI- 1. These findings propose a contributory mechanism for the fibrinolytic abnormalities of diabetes and the thrombotic tendency of the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state...|$|R
