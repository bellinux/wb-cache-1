40|$|Context: When {{massive stars}} exert a {{radiation}} pressure onto their {{environment that is}} higher than their gravitational attraction, they launch a radiation-pressure-driven outflow.

Aims: We investigate the stability of idealized radiation-pressure-dominated cavities, focusing on its dependence on the radiation transport approach for the stellar radiation feedback.

40|$|Context. When {{massive stars}} exert a {{radiation}} pressure onto their {{environment that is}} higher than their gravitational attraction (super-Eddington condition), they launch a radiation-pressure-driven outflow, which creates cleared cavities. These cavities should prevent any further accretion onto the star {{from the direction of}} the bubble, although it has been claimed that a radiative Rayleigh-Taylor instability should lead to the collapse of the outflow cavity and foster the growth of massive stars. Aims. We investigate the stability of idealized radiation-pressure-dominated cavities, focusing on its dependence on the radiation transport approach used in numerical simulations for the stellar radiation feedback. Methods. We compare two different methods for stellar radiation feedback: gray flux-limited diffusion (FLD) and ray-tracing (RT). Both methods are implemented in our self-gravity radiation hydrodynamics simulations for various initial density structures of the collapsing clouds, eventually forming massive stars. We also derive simple analytical models to support our findings. Results. Both methods lead to the launch of a radiation-pressure-dominated outflow cavity. However, only the FLD cases lead to prominent instability in the <b>cavity</b> <b>shell.</b> The RT cases do not show such instability; once the outflow has started, it precedes continuously. The FLD cases display extended epochs of marginal Eddington equilibrium in the <b>cavity</b> <b>shell,</b> making them prone to the radiative Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

The designed solar collector is based on the combination of a novel compound curved surface concentrator and an aluminum concentric solar receiver, which is contained in a glass evacuated-tube. As there is no perforative joint between the double-skin glass evacuated-tube and the aluminum concentric solar receiver, the difficulty of vacuum keeping for a glass-metal joint is avoided.

This bacterium-feeding nematode has potential for the biological control of slugs, especially the grey garden slug, Deroceras reticulatum. Infective juveniles of P. hermaphrodita invade the <b>shell</b> <b>cavity</b> of the slug, develop into self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, and produce progeny, resulting in host death. However, {{the role of the}} associated bacterium in the pathogenicity of the nematode to the slug is unknown. We discovered that M. osloensis alone is pathogenic to D. reticulatum after injection into the <b>shell</b> <b>cavity</b> or hemocoel of the slug. The bacteria from 60 -h cultures were more pathogenic than the bacteria from 40 -h cultures, as indicated by the higher and more rapid mortality of the slugs injected with the former. Coinjection of penicillin and streptomycin with the 60 -h bacterial culture reduced its pathogenicity to the slug. Further work suggested that the reduction and loss of pathogenicity of the aged infective juveniles of P. hermaphrodita to D. reticulatum result from the loss of M. osloensis from the aged nematodes.

Our simulations explore {{the nature of the}} outflow when a spherical wind expands into a rotating, collapsing envelope. We compare with key observational properties of the outflow system of Source I in the BN/KL region. Our calculations show that the wind evacuates a bipolar outflow cavity in the infalling envelope. We find the head of the outflow to be unstable and that it rapidly fragments into clumps. We resolve the dynamics of the strong shear layer which defines the side walls of the cavity. We conjecture that this layer is the likely site of maser emission and examine its morphology and rotational properties. The shell of swept up ambient gas that delineates the cavity edge retains its angular momentum. This rotation is roughly consistent with that observed in the Source I SiO maser spots. The observed proper motions and lineof-sight velocity are approximately reproduced by the model. The <b>cavity</b> <b>shell</b> {{at the base of the}} flow assumes an X-shaped morphology which is also consistent with Source I.

In each region the 3. 2 mm continuum emission exhibits a dense and compact dust core {{at the center}} with 1 to 3 solar masses. The cores have number densities exceeding 109 cm− 3, which are among the highest volume densities observed in star-forming cores. In both regions the N 2 H + shows clumpy structures which are spatially displaced from the densest gas. In OIR 8 nw 2 in particular, the N 2 H + shows a noticeable filament structure with a central <b>cavity</b> <b>shell.</b> The calculation for the dynamical state shows that this core can be potentially supported by the magnetic field against its gravitational instability, but the fragmentation might still occur and produce the observed N 2 H + clumps if the gas density exceeds 5 × 107 cm− 3 and this value is available within the observed density range. And the extremely high density at the core center suggests the super-Jeans condition and possibility for further fragmentation. For the chem-ical properties, the N 2 H +-to-HCO+ abundance ratios show a difference with that observed in infrared dark clouds. A combined analysis with the other Orion cores and the chemical model suggests that the different abundance ra-tios {{can be explained by}} the low CO abundances in our cores.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Finite element {{models of}} lung motion can aid in {{understanding}} mechanically driven lung deformation. Current {{finite element models}} consider each lung half as a continuum, lacking the ability to capture the displacement discontinuity at fissures caused by lobe sliding. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to develop and evaluate finite element models for simulating lung motion that incorporate the role of sliding at the lobe boundaries. METHODS: Finite element models were developed from 4 DCT of tidal breathing from five cancer subjects. To allow sliding, the lobes were modeled as independent bodies within a pleural <b>cavity</b> <b>shell.</b> Pleural cavity deformation was obtained from deformable image registration of the lung segmentations. Contact between the pleural cavity and lobes prevented penetration and allowed sliding at all interfaces. Lung parenchyma was modeled as a homogeneous, 2 -parameter, Neo-Hookean finite elastic model. The parameters of the Neo-Hookean model, C 1 and D 1, were optimized by perturbation within realistic reported ranges; defined by the equivalent infinitesimal elasticity parameters: Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus (from 0. 7 kPa to 70 kPa) and ν (from 0. 2 to 0. 49). The frictional coefficient at fissures was perturbed between 0 (free sliding) and 1. 5 (no sliding). 1, 960 finite element analyses were performed across the five subjects. The optimal parameter ranges were evaluated by average landmark error and percentage of converged solutions. The developed finite element method, using optimized material and friction parameters, was further evaluated in a data set of six healthy subjects with image pairs spanning functional residual capacity (FRC) to total lung capacity (TLC). The finite element predicted displacement field for lobe sliding finite element models and continuum-based finite element models were compared using average landmark error and correlation with the lobe-by-lobe deformable image registration results. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The optimal parameters for Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus were 49 kPa to 70 kPa and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio were 0. 2 to 0. 4. Variation of inter-lobar frictional coefficients did change displacement field accuracy assessed by landmark error or correlation to lobe-by-lobe deformable image registration. Characteristics of sliding predicted by the lobe sliding finite element models were consistent with characteristics in sliding observed in deformable image registration results. Also, variations in regional ventilation, quantified at the lobe level, were predicted by the finite element models and were shown {{to be influenced by}} the amount of lobe sliding allowed by the models...|$|E
