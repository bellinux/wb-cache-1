40|$|In this chapter, {{we present}} and {{describe}} a spike-based signal coding scheme for general analog computation, suitable for diverse applications, including programmable analog arrays and neuromorphic systems. This coding scheme provides a reliable method for both communication and computation of signals using an asynchronous digital <b>common</b> <b>access</b> <b>channel.</b> Using ternary coders and decoders, this scheme codes analog signals into time domain using asynchronous digital spikes. The spike output {{is dependent on}} input signal activity and is similar for constant signals. Systems based on this scheme present intrinsic computation: several arithmetic operations are performed without additional hardware and can be fully programmed. The design methodology and analog circuit design of the scheme are presented. Both simulations and test results from prototype chips implemented using a 3. 3 -V, 0. 35 -µm CMOS technology are presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design and {{realization}} of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) for fast Signal Recognition and Code Acquisition (SR/CA) in Direct-Sequence Spread-Spectrum Code Division Multiple Access (DS-SS-CDMA) receivers operating in a satellite or terrestrial radio network. The SR/CA problem is often the bottleneck of any DS-SS-CDMA system operating in spread-Aloha random access mode for the <b>common</b> <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> or when packet mode operation is envisaged. The single ASIC implementation provides a reliable, high-performance, low-cost, low-power consumption solution to such a problem. In particular, this paper explains how a parallel acquisition circuit can be effectively implemented on a single chip with a 1. 0 μm CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon) technology, complying with the specifications of the ESA (European Space Agency) /Inisel Ku-band CDMA VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) system...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{optimizing}} the detection performance of sensor networks under communication constraints on the <b>common</b> <b>access</b> <b>channel.</b> Our work helps understanding tradeoffs between sensor network parameters like number of sensors, degree of quantization at each local sensor, and SNR. Traditionally, this problem is tackled using asymptotic assumptions on the number of sensors, an approach that leads to the abstraction of important details such as the structure of the fusion center. We adopt a non-asymptotic approach and optimize both, the sensing and the fusion sides with respect to the probability of detection error. We show that the optimal fusion rule has an interesting structure similar to themajority-votingrule. In addition, we study the convergence with respect to the number of sensors of the performance of the fusion rule. We show that convergence is SNR dependent and that, in low-SNR environments, asymptotics may require a large number of sensors.

40|$|Abstract—In a {{wireless}} sensor network (WSN), the nodes collect independent observations about a nonrandom parameter to be estimated, and deliver informations to a fusion center (FC) by transmitting suitable waveforms through a <b>common</b> multiple <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> (MAC). The FC implements some appropriate fusion rule and outputs the final estimate of. In this paper, we introduce a new access/estimation scheme, here referred to as likelihood-based multiple access (LBMA), and prove it to be asymptotically efficient {{in the limit of}} increasingly large number of sensors, when the used bandwidth is allowed to scale as, H S I. The proposed approach is easy to implement, and simply relies upon the very basic property that the log likelihood is additive for independent observations, and upon the fact that the (noiseless) output of the MAC is just the sum of its inputs. Thus, the optimal fusion rule is automatically implemented by the MAC itself.

40|$|Future radio {{systems will}} {{make use of}} {{cooperative}} concepts between independent transmitters and receivers to increase the coverage area and the data rate, and/or to decrease the power consumption of the wireless communication network. Therefore, a station wishing to transmit cooperates with reachable stations, in its vicinity to achieve a performance gain from the resulting distributed multiple antenna link. The resulting communication situation {{is related to the}} <b>common</b> multiple <b>access</b> <b>channel.</b> We consider the simple cooperative concept of amplify and forward, where the cooperating stations retransmit the amplified, received signal. In order to gain knowledge about the properties of the cooperative transmitter system, it is sensible to analyze its capacity. Furthermore, the amplification factors which maximize the system capacity with respect to the total transmission power of all transmit stations will lead to important system design information...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{integrated}} {{technologies are}} making networks of many inexpensive deployable autonomous sensors a reality. Individually, each sensor may not accomplish much, but working cooperatively {{they have for}} example the potential to monitor large areas, detect {{the presence or absence}} of targets, or track moving objects. These sensors operate under constraints imposed by scarce power and other limited resources like bandwidth or computing capacity. The paper considers detection in such a distributed sensors environment. We investigate the impact on detection performance, as measured by the probability of error, of such parameters as number of sensors, number of quantization levels at each sensor, or signal to noise ratio, under a rate constraint on the <b>common</b> <b>access</b> communications <b>channel.</b> We optimize the local detectors when the number of sensors is large. We show that the performance loss due to quantization decays exponentially fast as the number of bits per sensor increases and that the choice between hard versus soft local detectors depends not only on the noise distribution and the quantization rate, but also on the SNR under which the sensors operate. 1...|$|R

40|$|IEEE 802. 11 s is a draft IEEE 802. 11 {{amendment}} for mesh networking, defining how wireless devices can interconnect {{to create}} an ad-hoc network. It includes some mesh-specific optional MAC enhancements like Mesh Deterministic <b>Access,</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Channel</b> Framework, Intra-mesh Congestion Control and Power Management. Mesh Deterministic Access (MDA) is an access method that allows MPs to <b>access</b> the <b>channel</b> at selected times (called MDAOPs) with lower contention than would otherwise be possible. In this work we study Mesh Deterministic Access (MDA) feature. Specifically: we implement 802. 11 s in ns- 2 simulator and evaluate performance comparing results with those obtained with DCF. We also propose an improvement called Dynamic Relocation. Dynamic Relocation permits to overcome MDA limits by reallocating MDAOPs basing on statistics collected during transmission times. The effectiveness of MDA improved with Dynamic Relocation in a scenario with realistic traffic is then confirmed via a simulation analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A MANET is an {{autonomous}} collection of mobile users that communicate over relatively bandwidth constrained wireless links. Since the nodes are mobile, the network topology may change rapidly and unpredictably over time. They have undergone {{rapid growth in}} the past several years because of their application in military and rescue services, disaster recovery operations, mobile conferencing and many other applications. The Media Access Control (MAC) data communication protocol sub-layer provides addressing and <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> mechanisms that make it possible for network nodes to <b>access</b> <b>common</b> wireless <b>channel</b> through Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). The major problem with available wireless network is collision and slow collision resolution when the number of station increases. When the nodes are competing for <b>channel</b> <b>access,</b> only single node got <b>channel</b> <b>access.</b> Whenever node <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> the outcome occurs in two cases either successful transmission or collision. The problem with original MAC protocol is its static behaviour. It means at each collision it’s waiting time increases exponentially and at each successful transmission its waiting time decreases one slot at a time. Due to this static behaviour of existing 802. 11 MAC protocol we proposed our modified algorithm that is Adaptive in nature and changes with time. In our proposed work we will modify the existing Back-off algorithm and proposed an enhanced adaptive MAC protocol for wireless LAN and compare the performance of enhanced adaptive 802. 11 MAC with conventional 802. 11 MAC protocol on different parameters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{wireless}} {{mesh network}} (WMN), especially in distributed (infrastructure-less) mode, <b>common</b> <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> results in inter-node interference which limits {{the available capacity}} of the network. To facilitate {{the growth of the}} network (i. e., addition of new routers/nodes), it is therefore necessary to identify the maximum allowable system capacity that can be achieved without degrading the performance. In this paper, we propose a dimensioning mechanism for a 802. 16 based distributed WMN where we utilize the results of [1] to analyze the system capacity (conversely node capacity) in bottleneck conditions. To guarantee appropriate throughput for the bottleneck and its neighboring nodes, the network bound (maximum number of added nodes, hu) is set accordingly. Simulations results demonstrate the validity of the proposed dimensioning algorithm and enables network providers or operators to select hu in accordance to their system requirements. I...|$|R

HIDDEN AND EXPOSED NODE PROBLEMS The transmission range of stations in wireless network is limited by the transmission power; therefore, all the station in a LAN cannot listen to each other. This means that normal carrier sense mechanism which assumes that all stations can listen to each other, fails. In particular, this gives rise to hidden node and exposed node problem.

40|$|Meniscal lesions {{often occur}} in the {{avascular}} area of the meniscus with little chance of spontaneous repair. An <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> in the meniscal tissue can function as an entrance for ingrowing repair tissue from the vascular periphery of the meniscus to the lesion in the avascular zone which again induced healing of the lesion. Implantation of a porous polymer in a full-thickness <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> induced healing. However, a better integration between meniscal tissue and the implant might be achieved with {{the combination of the}} newly developed porous polymers and a modified surgical technique. This might improve meniscal lesion healing and the repair of the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> with neo-meniscal tissue. Longitudinal lesions were created in the avascular part of 24 canine lateral menisci and a partial-thickness <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> was formed to connect the lesion with the meniscal periphery. In 12 menisci, the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> was left empty (control group), while in the remaining 12 menisci the polymer implant was sutured into the <b>access</b> <b>channel.</b> Repair of the longitudinal lesions was achieved with and without polymer implantation in the partial-thickness <b>access</b> <b>channel.</b> Polymer implants induced fibrous ingrowth with cartilaginous areas, which resembled neo-meniscal tissue.

In this paper, closed form equations are developed for the collision statistics of the W-CDMA Random <b>Access</b> <b>channel</b> and for the average SINR of a multi-packet collision in a generalized fading channel, with diversity reception at the Base Station.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{maintenance}} dredging an <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> to a canal estate in Deception Bay, Australia, {{on the nearby}} seagrasses was monitored over 18 months with a Before/After, Control/Impact, Repeated measures (BACIR) sampling design. Three seagrasses were collected in the study area; Zostera capricorni Aschers., Halophila ovalis (R. Br.) Hook. f. and Halophila spinulosa (R. Br.) Aschers. All seagrasses were found less than 700 m offshore. The biomass of Z. capricorni, the numerically dominant seagrass, was significantly lower in the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> border compared with the control area before dredging, which was attributed to direct or indirect effects associated with the channel. There was no significant effect of maintenance dredging statistically detected for Z. capricorni biomass in the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> border even though seagrass was absent in the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> 14 months after dredging. This {{was due to the}} high background variability of seagrass biomass in the control area. In contrast the biomass of H. ovalis declined at a significantly higher rate in the control area than in the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> border but had also disappeared from the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> border 14 months after dredging. Without a control we may have concluded that the disappearance of seagrass from the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> border was due to the effects of dredging, whereas with a BACIR sampling program there remained a possibility that the decline in seagrass was due to larger scale changes in the bay...|$|R
