A comparison between CoNiCrAlY bond coat and zirconia plasma sprayed coatings on creep tests of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy was studied. The material used was commercial Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. Yttria (8 wt. %) stabilized zirconia (YSZ) with a CoNiCrAlY bond coat was atmospherically plasma sprayed on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V substrates by Sulzer Metco Type 9 MB. Constant load creep tests were conducted on a standard creep machine in air on coated samples, at stress levels of 520 MPa at 500 ºC to evaluate the oxidation protection on creep of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy.

Thermomechanical and {{electrical}} properties of zirconia-based ceramics {{have led to}} a wide range of advanced and engineering ceramic applications like solid electrolyte in oxygen sensors, fuel <b>cells</b> and <b>furnace</b> elements and its low thermal conductivity has allowed its use for thermal barrier coatings for aerospace engine components. In this work, PSZ (partially stabilized zirconia) was studied to analyze the behavior during sintering in low oxygen partial pressure. Zirconia was partially stabilized with yttria 8 wt%. The sintering temperatures used were 1600, 1700, 1800 and 1900 °C. The study of PSZ sintered in low oxygen partial pressure was done using Scanning Electron Microscope, X Ray Diffraction and density analysis. The values of samples density showed that the increasing in sintering temperature was favorable to the material densification. The monoclinic phase converted in tetragonal and cubic phases. The tetragonal phase maintains constant in all sintering temperatures, but the cubic phase increased at 1700 and 1800 °C.

40|$|Gallium and boron {{doped silicon}} solar cells, {{processed}} by ion implantation followed by either laser or furnace anneal were irradiated by 1 MeV electrons and their postirradiation recovery by thermal annealing was determined. During the postirradiation anneal, gallium doped cells prepared by both processes recovered more rapidly and exhibited {{none of the}} severe reverse annealing observed for similarly processed 2 ohm-cm boron doped <b>cells.</b> Ion implanted <b>furnace</b> annealed 0. 1 ohm-cm boron doped cells exhibited the lowest post-irradiation annealing temperatures after irradiation. The drastically lowered recovery temperature is attributed to the reduced oxygen and carbon content of the 0. 1 ohm-cm cells.

40|$|A {{confocal}} Raman system {{combined with}} a high-temperature <b>furnace</b> <b>cell</b> has been established to monitor the formation of cobalt silicides. This system enables the quasi in situ study {{of the influence of}} temperature, annealing duration, and oxygen impurities on phase transformation. The experimental data indicate that the Co 2 Si phase tends to form at low temperatures and emits only extremely weak signal. The CoSi phase is stable at temperatures lower than 500 degreesC but transforms to the CoSi 2 phase at 550 degreesC. Two kinds of mechanisms were proposed: one is the diffusion-limited formation occurring at low temperatures (650 degreesC), where phase transformation is so fast that the CoSi phase is practically impossible to be observed with Raman. Lastly, the formation of cobalt silicides in an oxygen-containing annealing ambient and for an oxidized cobalt film in an oxygen-free ambient was studied. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{is presented to}} simultaneously diffuse boron and phosphorus in silicon, and grow an in-situ passivating oxide in a single furnace step. It is shown that limited solid doping sources made from P and B Spin-On Dopant (SOD) films can produce optimal n{sup +} and p{sup +} profiles simultaneously without the deleterious effects of cross doping. A high quality passivating oxide is grown in-situ beneath the thin ({approximately} 60 {angstrom}) diffusion glass, resulting in low J{sub o} values below 100 fA/cm{sup 2 } for transparent ({approximately} 100 {Omega}/{open_square}) phosphorus and boron diffusions. For {{the first time it}} is shown that impurities present in the boron SOD film can be effectively filtered out by employing separate source wafers, resulting in bulk lifetimes in excess of 1 ms for the sample wafers. The degree of lifetime degradation in the sources is related to the gettering efficiency of boron in silicon. This novel simultaneous diffusion, in-situ oxidation, impurity filtering and gettering technique was successfully used to produce 20. 3 % Fz, and 19. 1 % Cz solar <b>cells,</b> in one <b>furnace</b> step...|$|R
40|$|Papers {{presented}} to the 11 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 20 - 23 July 2015. Wood is heated to temperatures {{in the range of}} 180 – 240 °C in heat-treatment furnaces. At these temperatures, the wood structure undergoes changes leading to better dimensional stability, better resistance to biological attacks, and a darker attractive color. The high-temperature heat treatment of wood is an alternate and ecologically-sound wood preservation process to chemically treated wood. During heat treatment, wood goes through simultaneous heat and mass transfer. The heat is transferred from the hot gases to the wood boards in the furnace. As the temperature of wood increases, water content of wood vaporizes and diffuses out of the boards. At higher temperatures, a number of irreversible structural changes take place in wood <b>cells.</b> The <b>furnace</b> design is important to carry out the heat treatment process uniformly and effectively. A new heat treatment furnace design has been proposed at UQAC and a prototype furnace has been built and tested. Also, a 3 D model of the furnace was developed to complement the experimental work and to gain insight into the heat treatment process taking place in the furnace. In this article, the new furnace design and its advantages are discussed. Results of the measurements and predictions of the mathematical model are {{presented to}} show the effectiveness of the new furnace design for heat treating standard wood boards as well as pieces of wood with different geometries.

40|$|Three {{different}} Pd-C eutectic fixed-point {{cells were}} prepared and investigated at INRIM. Several tens of phase transition runs {{were carried out}} and recorded with both a Si-based radiation thermometer at 950 nm and a precision InGaAs-based thermometer at 1. 6 μm. Two of the cells were of the same design with an inner volume of 12 cm 3. The third one was smaller with a useful inner volume of 3. 6 cm 3. The three cells were filled with palladium powder 4 N 5 or 4 N 8 pure and graphite powder 6 N pure. The repeatability and stability of the inflection point were investigated {{over a period of}} 1 year. The noticeably different external dimensions of the two cells, namely, 110 mm and 40 mm in length, allowed the influence of the longitudinal temperature distribution to be investigated. For this purpose, two different furnaces, a single-zone with SiC heaters and a three-zone with MoSi 2 heaters, were used. Different operative conditions, namely, temperature steps, melting rate, longitudinal temperature distributions, and position of <b>cells</b> within the <b>furnace,</b> were tested to investigate the reproducibility of the cells. Effects on the duration and shape of the plateaux were also studied.

40|$|The {{research}} project was initiated {{to refine the}} knowledge available on the treatment of rural municipal wastewater by constructed wetlands. Field and laboratory studies were conducted to determine the treatment capacity of a constructed wetland system and to determine a substrate that would be most efficient as a phosphorus adsorption filter. The wetland system consisted of three free-water surface <b>cells,</b> three blast <b>furnace</b> slag filters and a vegetated filter strip, treating municipal wastewater. Bimonthly water samples at the inlet and outlet of each component of the wetland system were analysed for biochemical oxygen demand, nitrate and nitrite, ammonia and ammonium, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total suspended solids, total phosphorus, ortho-phosphate, fecal coliforms and E. coli. Phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were determined in the sediment, plant tissue and water column of the free-surface wetland cells. The free-surface wetland cells achieved removals as follows: ammonia and ammonium (52 %), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (37 %), total suspended solids (93 %), total phosphorus (90 %) and ortho-phosphate (82 %). The vegetated filter strip achieved removals as follows: ammonia and ammonium (28 %), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (11 %), total suspended solids (22 %), total phosphorus (5 %) and ortho-phosphate (0 %). The slag filters reduced total phosphorus by more than 99 %. Phosphorus adsorption measurements were conducted on slag, calcite and shale. Slag {{was found to be}} the most effective at removing phosphate...|$|R
30|$|In particular, silica (SiO 2) {{is a very}} {{important}} species because it is the dominant component of silicates and would control the overall thermodynamic parameters of vaporization of silicates (e.g., Gerasimov et al., 1998). Actually, the reactions between silica and carbon have been studied for many years because of their industrial importance, such as the production of iron, silicon, and silicon carbide. Experiments have shown that SiO 2 reacts with C to generate SiC and CO under such “metallurgic” conditions, C/SiO 2 ≫ 1 (e.g., Klinger et al., 1966; Biernacki and Wotzak, 1989 a). This is consistent with thermodynamic equilibrium calculations, which indicate that SiC and CO are stable at high temperatures. The reactions under such conditions are known to proceed via solid-solid and solid-vapor reaction paths in a well-controlled and static reaction <b>cells</b> or <b>furnaces</b> (Biernacki and Wotzak, 1989 b; Klinger et al., 1966). These studies show that carbon is oxidized by silica-derived oxygen. Thus, silica cannot be readily excluded from the consideration of the composition of gases produced within impact-induced vapor plumes. Reactions in actual impact vapor plumes, however, may be greatly different from those in static metallurgic conditions. First, such reactions would be influenced by rapid cooling due to adiabatic expansion of vapor plumes. Second, the composition of the reaction system is not “metallurgic” (C/SiO 2 ≫ 1) but “meteoritic” (C/SiO 2 ≪ 1) that is produced by silicate-rich impactors. Reactions in such dynamic rapidly cooling reaction systems with a meteoritic composition have not been intensively studied before, and final products in such reaction systems have not been known either. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations indicate that gaseous SiO and CO are generated at high temperatures under such C/SiO 2 ≫ 1 conditions. For example, under 1 bar condition, SiO and CO can coexist stably at > 2000 K. However, at < 2000 K SiO 2 and C are stable, and neither SiO nor CO can exist stably. This means that although SiO and CO may be formed at a high temperature, they would react to yield SiO 2 and C if the thermal equilibrium is maintained during the cooling of vapor plumes down to < 2000 K. It is not known whether SiO and CO can survive the adiabatic cooling of vapor plumes. In other words, {{it is not clear that}} SiO 2 can be an efficient oxidizing agent in impact-induced vapor clouds.|$|R
40|$|The {{cytotoxicity}} of the metallointercalators, [Pt(5, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline) (trans- 1 R, 2 Rdiaminocyclohexane) ] 2 + ([56 MERR]) and [Pt(5, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline) (trans- 1 S, 2 Sdiaminocyclohexane) ] 2 + ([56 MESS]), towards A 549 {{human lung}} cancer cells was examined using the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The IC 50 value obtained following exposure of A 549 cells to [56 MESS] for 4 h was approximately three times {{smaller than that}} obtained when [56 MERR] was administered under the same conditions, indicating that the former complex displayed greater cytotoxicity. Both IC 50 values were greater than that obtained after exposure of A 549 cells to cisplatin, demonstrating that the latter compound was the most cytotoxic of the three examined. Microprobe synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) analyses of metallointercalator-treated A 549 cells showed that platinum became localised in DNA-rich regions of the nucleus. In contrast, when the same cells were treated with cisplatin the metal became distributed throughout the cell. Determination of the maximum concentration of platinum present inside the <b>cells</b> using graphite <b>furnace</b> atomic absorption spectrophotometry (GFAAS) of platinum-treated cells suggested that there was greater uptake of [56 MERR] compared to [56 MESS] by the A 549 cells, and that platinum uptake did {{not account for the}} greater toxicity of [56 MESS], as assessed by the MTT assay. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (ESI-MS) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic studies of solutions containing either [56 MERR] or [56 MESS], and a duplex hexadecamer molecule, showed the two metallointercalators displayed very similar affinity towards the nucleic acid. Overall these results indicate that the difference in cytotoxicity of the two platinum metallointercalators is probably the result of variations in their interactions with other cellular components...|$|R
