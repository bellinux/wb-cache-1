40|$|The {{invention}} of a lightweight panel with {{the trade mark}} Dendrolight {{is one of the}} most distinguished wood industry innovations in the last decade. At present, three-layer <b>cellular</b> <b>wood</b> <b>panels</b> have wide non-structural application. The aim of the research was to evaluate the compression properties of three-layer <b>cellular</b> <b>wood</b> <b>panels</b> for structural application. 8 specimens were manufactured for both perpendicular and parallel compression tests for each of 6 structural panel models. Scots pine <b>cellular</b> <b>wood</b> and solid pine wood ribs were used as the core layer of the structural <b>panels.</b> The <b>cellular</b> <b>wood</b> core was placed in a horizontal or vertical direction. Solid Scots pine <b>wood</b> <b>panels</b> and birch plywood as top layer material were used. The common stress type in subfloor and wall panels is compression, therefore the influences of the cellular material orientation, ribs and top layer ma-terial on the sandwich-type structural panel compression strength were evaluated according to LVS EN 408. 15 [LVS EN 408]. Extra parameters, such as the mo-isture content and apparent density, were determined. Different structural models have a great effect on the compression strength of <b>cellular</b> <b>wood</b> material <b>panels.</b> The highest compression strength in a parallel direction, 17. 5 MPa, was achieved with a structural model with cellular material placed vertically, with the ribs and top layers of solid timber, but in a perpendicular direction, 4. 48 MPa was achieved with a structural model with cellular material placed vertically and the top layers of plywood. Solid wood ribs significantly influence the compression strength when the panels are loaded in a parallel direction...|$|R

The stress distribution in and the deformation behaviour of solid <b>wood</b> <b>panels</b> were analysed using the composite theory. The shear influence in solid <b>wood</b> <b>panels</b> was determined using the shear analogy method. A strength class system is proposed for the design of solid <b>wood</b> <b>panels</b> with cross layers depending on the type of stress and the panel build-up...|$|R

40|$|In this research, it {{is aimed}} to {{determine}} the general situation of edge glued <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> industry that is rapidly developing in Turkey with the reasons of this development similar to the development edge glued <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> industry in the world. Besides, starting from its definition, there are information about edge glued <b>wood</b> <b>panel,</b> comparison with other panel products and technology preferences of production. As {{the result of this}} study, there are 3 essential reasons of the rapid development of edge glued <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> industry in Turkey. These are; (1) Environmental health and ecological approaches as a movement of thought having impact on the consumer behaviors and rapidly improving throughout the world, (2) Having less production and investment cost compared to the other wood based material production and investments and (3) In addition to the advantages owned when compared to the other wood based materials, having the production technology involving flexible production systems to respond to every demand level. According to the data related to edge glued <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> demand and supplies, the production of edge glued <b>wood</b> <b>panels</b> replace to East Europe where there is also Turkey. It is determined that investment and cost of Turkish edge glued <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> are mainly in Marmara region (43. 3 %) and raw material (43 %) respectively. 67 % coniferous and 33 % broad leaved tree species are used in Turkish edge glued <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> production. The most preferred edge glued <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> thicknesses are 16, 19, 30 and 42 mm. The technological preferences of the manufacturers depend on their machines and production line with optimization systems where as the usersâ preferences are price and quality by 90 %. It is determined that with its structural condition, the sector is open for investment and development...|$|R
40|$|The method {{involves}} {{recording a}} narrow side (2) of the <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> (1) {{with a camera}} device (4) after compression in a continuous hot press. The images acquired by the camera device are evaluated based on {{the thickness of the}} <b>wood</b> <b>panel.</b> The density distribution in the dissolved layer is determined by the thickness of the <b>wood</b> <b>panel.</b> The lighting device (5) and the camera device are arranged in a constant orientation to each other. An independent claim is included for apparatus for determining density distribution in wood material plate. USE: Method for determining density distribution in wood material plate. ADVANTAGE: The density distribution of the wood material plate is calculated effectively, so that quality of wood-based panels is ensured made. The production efficiency of the wood-based panel is improved effectively. The variance in the apparent densities is reduced effectively. The gray value distribution of apparatus is less expensive. The quality of the recordings is improved effectively. The structure of the wood material plate is simple, so that manufacturing cost of the wood material plate is reduced effectively. The drawing shows a perspective view of the wood material plate. 1 : <b>Wood</b> <b>panel</b> 2 : Narrow side of <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> 3 : Main surface of <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> 4 : Camera device 5 : Lighting device...|$|R

Doors may be {{fabricated}} {{of solid}} material, either engineered wood (particle board or medium-density fiberboard, but not typically plywood) or solid <b>wood.</b> Engineered <b>wood</b> <b>panels</b> may either {{be used as}} slabs or may be shaped to resemble frame-and-panel construction. In either case, engineered <b>wood</b> <b>panels</b> are generally painted, veneered, or laminated. Solid <b>wood</b> <b>panels</b> are typically formed of multiple boards of the selected wood species, jointed together using glue and may either be painted or finished. Solid wood construction offers the possibility of refinishing in case of damage or wear.|$|R
40|$|An {{application}} of In-Situ method of measuring {{sound absorption coefficient}} {{on the surface of}} direct piercing carved <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> using the concept of ensemble averaged is discussed. The method offer an easier way to measure the absorption performance for each individual aperture of carved <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> with floral pattern which was replicated from one of the oldest mosque, namely Masjid Abidin located in Terengganu, Malaysia. Two pieces of 20 mm thick of cengal wood (Neobalanocarpus heimii) with 30 % and 40 % perforation ratio were respectively measured in a reverberation room {{in order to determine the}} value of. At lower frequencies (0. 1 kHz- 1. 5 kHz), the measured values of for both direct piercing carved <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> with floral pattern (Daun Sireh motif) are shown that the sound absoption for both direct piercing carved <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> are in perform level. From the measurements, clearly, the installation of the direct piercing carved <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> with floral pattern (Daun Sireh motif) in the Masjid Abidin can provide better air circulation and additional natural sunlight, as well as better sound intelligibility inside the building...|$|R
