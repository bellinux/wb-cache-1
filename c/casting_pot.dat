40|$|Finds and {{chronology}} {{of a middle}} Copper Age settlement in Budapest, 3 rd district. In the spring of 2002, rescue excavations were conducted in Kiscelli Street, Budapest for about {{one and a half}} months preceding the construction of a residential block. Finds and features of the middle Copper Age were found under a thick Roman period layer. The time was not enough to reach the subsoil on the entire territory, so not all the prehistoric features could be uncovered. Twelve pits and a small oven were unearthed from the middle Copper Age. The number of finds was uneven in them. An important result was that we could observe the traces of metallurgy: the fragment of a <b>casting</b> <b>pot</b> and copper drops, which imply local copper production. The analysis of the ceramic material led to the conclusion that this site represents a yet unregistered although, according to former finds, already existing phase of the Hungarian middle Copper Age, which lends a special importance to this site. This study is dedicated to Erzsébet Ruttkay, an eminent researcher of the period, who died last year...|$|E
40|$|The {{temperature}} of molten steel {{is the main}} parameter on which it can be operated before the steel arrives in the continuous cast machine and during the continuous cast process. It is a known fact that, the {{temperature of}} the continuous cast steel has to be situated between much more restrained limits, recommending as optimal values for {{the temperature of the}} steel into the <b>casting</b> <b>pot</b> values higher than the liquid temperature with 30 - 60 o C, respectivly 15 to 40 o C over the liquid temperature in the tundish. An adequate conduct of the furnace and a secondary treatment properly managed can insure these values. But if this thing is not possible, must found different technological method to frame the temperature in requested limits. A first settlement can be realized in the tundish of continuous casting machine, either through using cover dusts (for a lower temperature), either through the usage of micro-coolers (to bigger temperatures than one admitted). Also, a big temperature can tune in crystallizer, through the microcoolers introduction. The paper introduces some researches with regard to the temperature settlement in the tundish of continuous casting machine...|$|E
40|$|Continuous casting (CtCs) slag, {{produced}} {{at the final}} stage of stainless steel production, is the residue left in the continuous <b>casting</b> <b>pot</b> after the casting of ingots. It has little valorization potential because of its dusty appearance and therefore is currently land filled. Elemental analysis by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) shows high amount of CaO in the slag indicating that the slag may have cementing/binding capabilities. Quantitative phase analysis by X-ray diffraction (QXRD) shows that gamma dicalcium silicate is the major mineral phase in the slag with other minerals like cuspidine, priclase and bredigite are present in smaller amounts. The slag mortar (slag with 0 - 5 sand in 1 : 3 ratio) can be activated using potassium hydroxide (KOH) in combination with potassium silicate (in 25 %, 50 % and 75 % replacement of alkali) as activator when steam cured at 80 °C. Isothermal conduction calorimetry at 80 °C showed elevated heat evolutions at higher replacements of silicates in the activator solution. Steam cured slag mortar samples were found to achieve strengths above 15 MPa at 28 days. SEM images show minor presence of K in hydrated slag although showing definitive presence of Mg at some places. The results show the potential of CtCs slag {{to be used as a}} binder component contributing to valorisation of recycled material into construction material. status: publishe...|$|E

50|$|The Old Furnace began life as {{a typical}} blast furnace, but went over to coke in 1709. Abraham Darby I used it to <b>cast</b> <b>pots,</b> kettles and other goods. His {{grandson}} Abraham Darby III smelted the iron {{here for the first}} Ironbridge, the world's first iron bridge.|$|R
5000|$|He also {{developed}} a method for <b>casting</b> <b>pots</b> in 'greensand' moulds, previously only used for smaller castings. This enabled pots to be mass-produced and to be thinner than those made by the traditional process of casting in loam moulds. For this purpose, he established the Cheese Lane Foundry in 1704. Initially he <b>cast</b> brass <b>pots,</b> but by 1705, {{he moved on to}} using iron. [...] A young Welsh apprentice, John Thomas, solved the problem by using sand for the mould, with a special casting box and core. Using this casting method Darby could <b>cast</b> <b>pots</b> of sufficient thinness and lightness. Darby took out a patent on the new casting method in 1707, [...] Darby's successors sold pots over wide areas of England and Wales, and had a virtual monopoly in the trade. [...] For this he used a reverberatory air furnace of a kind developed by Sir Clement Clerke, initially for smelting lead near Bristol, and applied by him or his son Talbot to iron founding at Vauxhall.|$|R

50|$|Abraham Darby made an {{important}} step towards the Industrial Revolution. His method of <b>casting</b> <b>pots</b> in sand provided his successors with a viable business that operated for over two centuries. Smelting iron with coke ultimately released the iron industry from the limitation imposed by the speed of growth of trees. Coke-smelted cast iron went into steam engines, bridges, {{and many of the}} inventions of the 19th century. Only with coke smelting could there be produced the great quantities of iron made to meet the requirements of the Industrial Revolution.|$|R

5000|$|The furnace {{was used}} {{for the first time on}} 10 January 1709 and the blast appears to have been successful. Darby was {{probably}} helped by the fact that the Shropshire 'clod coal' that he was using was fairly sulphur-free. However, experimentation with different fuels continued for some time; for example cargoes of coal were brought up the Severn from Bristol and Neath. [...] Some of the molten iron from the blast was run into pigs and sent down the Severn for use in Bristol foundries, but much of it was used to <b>cast</b> <b>pots</b> and other <b>cast</b> iron goods.|$|R

50|$|Closely {{associated}} with the American Old West, the Dutch oven of tradition is a heavy <b>cast</b> iron <b>pot,</b> traditionally made with three short legs and a concave cover for holding hot coals on top. While such pots are generally considered too heavy for backpackers, Dutch ovens are often used in group camp-outs and cookouts.|$|R
50|$|One ancient use of margaritomancy {{involved}} {{throwing a}} pearl into a <b>cast</b> iron <b>pot</b> that {{was sitting in}} a fire and watching it to determine a person's guilt or innocence in a crime.

5000|$|From the 14th century, {{food was}} {{prepared}} {{in the kitchen}} on a raised stone hlóðir or hearth. Hooks were placed above in order to hold the pots at the desired height above the fire. Ovens were rare, as these required lots of firewood for heating. Baking, roasting and boiling were all done in <b>cast</b> iron <b>pots,</b> usually imported.|$|R
5000|$|This {{method of}} food {{preparation}} involves using the Maillard reaction to [...] "brown" [...] the meat or vegetables and then deglazing with stock or water and simmering the mixture {{over low heat}} {{for an extended period}} of time.

5000|$|This dish is {{prepared}} in a <b>cast</b> iron <b>pot</b> called a [...] "Ghazan". Initially {{small pieces of}} meat are fried in oil, then onions are added and then shredded roast onions, tomatoes or tomato paste. The meat is boiled, and rice is added. The water level should be a knuckle above the rice, then the heat is decreased until the rice has cooked.|$|R
50|$|The pots are {{traditionally}} made of clay (土鍋, donabe) or thick cast iron (鉄鍋, tetsunabe). Clay pots can keep warm {{for a while}} after being taken off the fire, while <b>cast</b> iron <b>pots</b> evenly distribute heat and are preferable for sukiyaki.

50|$|Another {{modification}} to the Lalande-type cell was {{patented by}} Heinrich Poerscke and Gustav Wedekind in 1905, British patent GB190416751. In this cell, the copper oxide depolarizer was pasted {{on the inside}} of a <b>cast</b> iron <b>pot.</b> When the depolarizer was exhausted, the cell was dismantled and the liquid was poured out. The pot was then heated in air to re-oxidize the deposited copper to copper oxide. The Neotherm cell, by Siemens, was similar.|$|R

50|$|In 1707, Abraham Darby I {{patented}} {{a method}} of making <b>cast</b> iron <b>pots.</b> His pots were thinner and hence cheaper than those of his rivals. Needing a larger supply of pig iron he leased the blast furnace at Coalbrookdale in 1709. There, he made iron using coke, thus establishing the first successful business in Europe to do so. His products were all of cast iron, though his immediate successors attempted (with little commercial success) to fine this to bar iron.|$|R

40|$|Epoxy resins are a {{class of}} {{reactive}} pre polymers and polymers which contain epoxide groups. Inspite of their high costs the epoxy resins find many important applications. The resins are used in both molding and laminating technique for making glass fiber-reinforced articles which are having better mechanical strength chemical resistance and electrical insulating properties. They also use in <b>casting,</b> <b>potting</b> encapsulating and embedment in the electrical and tooling industries. The general important uses are industrial flooring adhesive foams, highway surfacing patching material and stabilizers for vinyl resins. Epoxy resins may be reacted either with them- selves through catalytic homo polymerization or {{with a wide range}} of co-reactant like amino acid,phenol, alcohols and thiols. These co-reactants are referred to as curatives. When linear epoxy resins react with suitable curative to form three dimensional cross linked thermo state structure. Epoxidation of unsaturated alcohol is carried out with the help of superoxide. The electrochemical generation of super-oxide anion and subsequent electro oxidation in situ is found to be advantageous and easy over the conventional technique. The work extended further in persuasive oxygen reduction studies on non-metallic surface such as different types of carbon and graphite with a view to understand the reaction mechanism and possible application to fuel cell technology...|$|R
5000|$|He {{followed}} in his father's footsteps in the Darby foundry business in Coalbrookdale, producing <b>cast</b> iron cooking <b>pots,</b> kettles, and other goods.

50|$|Traditionally, mămăliga {{is cooked}} by boiling water, salt and cornmeal in a special-shaped <b>cast</b> iron <b>pot</b> called ceaun or tuci. When cooked peasant-style {{and used as}} a bread substitute, mămăliga is {{supposed}} to be much thicker than the regular Italian polenta {{to the point that it}} can be cut in slices, like bread. When cooked for other purposes, mămăligă can be much softer, sometimes almost to the consistency of porridge. Because mămăligă sticks to metal surfaces, a piece of sewing thread can be used to cut it into slices instead of a knife; it can then be eaten by holding it with the hand, just like bread.|$|R
