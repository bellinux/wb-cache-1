40|$|Clear liquids {{are often}} part of {{colonoscopy}} preparation instructions, {{regardless of the}} active cleansing agent. Poor understanding of this facet may yield poor preparation with delays in management. We studied comprehension of this facet of colon preparation in an Appalachian population. Our survey contained demographic items {{and a list of}} food items from which subjects could select clear liquids. In Phase I, no prompting was given. In Phase II, subjects reviewed the definition of clear liquids and examples a few minutes before the survey. For Phase III, the survey contained the definition of a clear liquid and examples. Persons about to undergo colonoscopy and companions who escorted them were surveyed, since many persons have help during the preparation process. With the Fisher exact probability test, we compared the association of accurately selecting clear liquids ≥ or or ≤ 12 th grade, age, gender, and subject’s stated understanding of preparation. Mean age for all subjects was 52 years and 59 % of subjects were female. The majority had ≤ 12 years of education.

40|$|Aim Current {{literature}} on chronic periodontitis genetics encompasses numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms-focused case-control studies with inconsistent and controversial results, which typically disregards the exposure concept embraced by case-control definition. Herein, we propose a case-control design reappraisal by <b>clear</b> phenotype <b>selection,</b> where chronic gingivitis represents a genetically resistant phenotype/genotype opposing the susceptible cohort. Material and methods The hypothesis was tested in healthy, chronic periodontitis and gingivitis groups through Real-time PCR-based allelic discrimination of classic variants IL 1 B- 3954, IL 6 - 174, TNFA- 308, IL 10 - 592 and TLR 4 - 299. Results Observed allele/genotype frequencies characterize the healthy group with an intermediate genetic profile between periodontitis and gingivitis cohorts. When comparing genotype/allele frequencies in periodontitis versus healthy and periodontitis versus gingivitis scenarios, {{the number of}} positive associations (2 - 4) {{and the degree of}} association (p and odds ratio values) were significantly increased by the new approach proposed (periodontitis versus gingivitis), suggesting the association of IL 1 B- 3954, TNFA- 308, IL 10 - 592 and TLR 4 - 299 with periodontitis risk.
