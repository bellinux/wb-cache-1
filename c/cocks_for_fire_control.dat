40|$|The {{problem of}} {{shooting}} {{targets in the}} air is rather complex task, in which every missile system for air defence is responsible <b>for</b> <b>fire</b> <b>control.</b> In this paper we present a novel approach and mode <b>for</b> <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> in air-defence systems based on homing missiles. A device for calculation of the launching zone (AOZ) is used for intelligent estimation whether the target has entered the launching zone. The proposed novel approach makes essential use a fuzzy reasoning, a fuzzy-rule knowledge base for target’s velocity, to calculate the launching zone immediately upon the first detection of a target. Namely, it uses pre-defined launching zones for different flying regimes and different velocities of potential targets, and the data are stored into a look-up table along with the associated pass angles and flying times to the launching zone border. Computational model for simulation and simulation experiments were carried out using a new model constructed in Matlab-Simulink platform. Copyright © 2007 IFAC...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAiming at the {{problems}} of traditional buried tube nitrogen injection that the nitrogen injection spot with intervals in the space causes the failure of continuous nitrogen distribution in goaf, leading to poor inert effect, in addition, the un-recycling of the nitrogen injection pipe causes much resource waste. The nitrogen injection pipe material is always brittle, of which shear performance is better than its tensile performance. Based on this principle, new fire nitrogen injection process (rotating traction and non-interval) is designed, fundamentally solving major defects of buried tube nitrogen injection, which can realize the synchronous movement between nitrogen injection point and the workface. According to the unloading arch principle and the dynamic calculation of trenchless pipe directional crossing technology, the traction power of non-interval drag pipe nitrogen injection <b>for</b> <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> can be calculated and analyzed. By using a geotechnical engineering numerical simulation software, the stress distribution is simulated for the nitrogen injection pipe in the goaf of YAN ZI SHAN mine, and the traction power {{is calculated based on}} it, which lays foundation on successful fulfilments of non-interval nitrogen injection <b>for</b> <b>fire</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R
