5|$|Byrd was {{appointed}} to the post of assistant university president in 1918. He became a proponent of unification of the Maryland Agricultural College and the Baltimore professional schools into a single public University of Maryland, and he was instrumental in what became the <b>Consolidation</b> <b>Act</b> of 1920. Byrd named the student newspaper The Diamondback in 1921, and in 1933, he was the lead advocate for the adoption of the diamondback terrapin as the university's official nickname and mascot.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (<b>Consolidation)</b> <b>Act</b> 1801 {{was intended to}} make it easier for landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as a major source of employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E
5|$|Schuster also {{assisted}} Birkenhead in {{his attempts}} to reform {{the administration of the}} court system, particularly in his preparation of the Supreme Court (<b>Consolidation)</b> <b>Act</b> 1925. A committee was also set up to look into the reform of the Supreme Court, the County Courts and the Probate Services, divided into a subcommittee for each institution. Schuster served {{as a member of the}} committee, with his primary goal being to end the patronage and nepotism that filled the judicial system. Although the Supreme Court was resistant the committee did succeed in making some changes, such as introducing mandatory retirement ages for masters and clerks; they were unable, however, to end the patronage. Schuster also attempted to reform the County Courts by increasing their jurisdiction, and a Committee on County Court Procedure (known as the Swift Committee after its chairman Rigby Swift) was set up in 1920, with Schuster serving as a member. The commission concluded that HM Treasury had mismanaged the County Courts, and on 1 August 1922 the Lord Chancellor's Office instead became responsible for the courts, with Schuster becoming Accounting Officer. The committee's final report was used as the basis for the County Courts Act 1924, which did much to correct the problems with the County Courts. Schuster was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1920 New Year War Honours.|$|E

25|$|In October 2016, it was {{revealed}} in the media that Robinson was planning to donate her archive to Mayo County Council {{as part of the}} development of The Mary Robinson Centre, and had applied to have the archive designated under the Taxes <b>Consolidation</b> <b>Act,</b> 1997, potentially resulting in a personal tax credit to her worth over €2m, arising from the donation of her personal papers.

25|$|Under the 1928 Act, {{the storage}} of {{petroleum}} and petroleum products, whether in underground/above ground tanks or storage cabinets, required a licence issued by the Licensing Authority. In the metropolitan areas, this was the fire authority. In the county authorities, it was the local authority, but usually this was devolved down to the fire service. The Petroleum (<b>Consolidation)</b> <b>Act</b> 1928, as amended by Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No. 2776), changed the licensing regime and now requires only that anyone operating a petrol filling station have a licence.|$|E
25|$|In England and Wales, {{and other}} jurisdictions that follow the {{principles}} of English law, the related term compulsory purchase is used. The landowner is compensated with a price agreed or stipulated by an appropriate person. Where agreement on price cannot be achieved, {{the value of the}} taken land is determined by the Upper Tribunal. The operative law is a patchwork of statutes and case law. The principal Acts are the Lands Clauses <b>Consolidation</b> <b>Act</b> 1845, the Land Compensation Act 1961, the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965, the Land Compensation Act 1973, the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, part IX of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the Planning and Compensation Act 1991, and the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.|$|E

25|$|The Albany Park District {{fell behind}} on its bills by 1932 {{and it became}} clear that the district, as an {{independent}} entity, was not going to survive the lean years of the Great Depression. In 1934 there were 22 separate park districts operating in the city of Chicago. That year, motivated by the fiscal disaster the Depression had brought to many small independent agencies, voters approved the Park <b>Consolidation</b> <b>Act</b> of 1934 and unified all 22 disparate park districts, including the Albany Park District, into the Chicago Park District. The newly formed conglomerate qualified for $82 million in federal funding through the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Public Works Administration (PWA) between 1935 and 1941. These funds allowed extensive improvements throughout the Chicago park system and Eugene Field Park saw many changes in the 1930s and early 1940s. The athletic fields were improved, paths and sidewalks laid, and through a 1941-42 WPA project the river banks were graded, and retaining wall, rip rap, and chain link fence were installed along the river bank. It was during this time that the 60 foot tall light tower was erected near the tennis courts.|$|E
25|$|The {{right of}} workers to collectively {{withdraw}} their labour {{has always been}} used to make employers stick to a collective agreement. At critical moments of history, it also combatted political repression (e.g. the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, and the Indian Independence Movement up to 1947), prevented military coups against democratic governments (e.g. the general strike in Germany against the Kapp Putsch in 1920), and overthrew dictatorships (e.g. in the 2008 Egyptian general strike). Anti-democratic regimes cannot tolerate social organisation they do not control, {{which is why the}} right to strike is fundamental to every democratic society, and a recognised human right in international law. Historically, the UK recognised the right to strike at least since 1906. UK tradition has inspired the International Labour Organization Convention 87 (1948) articles 3 and 10, the case law of the European Court of Human Rights under article 11, and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights article 28. However, the scope of the right to take collective action has been controversial. Reflecting a series of restrictions from 1979 to 1997, the law was partially codified in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (<b>Consolidation)</b> <b>Act</b> 1992 sections 219 to 246, which now falls below international standards.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} right of freedom of assembly, there has not {{traditionally}} been positive protection {{of the right of}} freedom of association. The common law has recognised the autonomy of organisations in deciding their membership and legislation has not placed any general controls on the exercise of the right of association. The right is generally reflected in the principle of freedom of contract and the relative ease by which companies and trusts can be set up. The right is most regulated in the area of labour relations including the right to join a trade union which achieved statutory recognition in the Industrial Relations Act 1971, the right not to be dismissed or refused employment on the basis of non-membership under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (<b>Consolidation)</b> <b>Act</b> 1992 and the right to claim unfair dismissal on the basis of trade union activity. However, there is no obligation on employers to recognise collective bargaining agreements except in certain very limited circumstances and their role has declined significantly. The right to strike was acknowledged {{for the first time in}} March 2011 by the Court of Appeal. The right not to be unjustly excluded from the exercise of a trade or profession has been recognised by the courts, in a case brought by female horse trainer Florence Nagle against the Jockey Club's refusal to grant her a training licence on grounds of her sex.|$|E
