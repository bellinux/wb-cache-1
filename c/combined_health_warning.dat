40|$|Background: In {{the tobacco}} industry, {{cigarette}} packaging {{has always been}} a marketing instrument that responds to new trends in fashion and taste, but it also actively helps create and endorse these trends. A <b>combined</b> <b>Health</b> <b>warning</b> on cigarette packages has proven to be the least financially demanding tobacco control solution, which affects more or less all tobacco users. Aim: The aim of the present study is to look into the opinions and responses of Czech smokers in relation to the Directive 2014 / 40 /EU of the European Parliament and of The Council of 3 April 2014 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products. Methods: The data was collected using quantitative-qualitative online questionnaire survey among the customers of the "Relay". Volunteers were recruited in the shop, consent with study participation was obtained and the questionnaire was sent to their email addresses. Overall, 283 questionnaires were sent out, out of which 276 were included in the final analysis. In terms of gender, women were prevalent (54 %), with men constituting 45 %. Two individuals left the gender field blank. The mean age of participants was 37. Results: The results imply that the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: According to the attentional myopia model, salient cues {{that serve}} to inhibit {{behavior}} can be especially effective under conditions of limited attention. A small field study tested {{the implications of this}} model for smoking reduction. METHODS: Twenty-three undergraduate smokers were exposed to a prominent <b>health</b> <b>warning</b> for 2 5 -day experimental phases, with phase order counterbalanced across participants. During one phase, participants simply viewed the warning at regular intervals. During the other phase, participants viewed the warning for the same duration but also simultaneously performed a distracting cognitive load task. RESULTS: Participants in the phase that <b>combined</b> a <b>health</b> <b>warning</b> with cognitive load reported smoking significantly fewer cigarettes and taking significantly fewer puffs of smoke as compared to a baseline comparison phase-a reduction in smoking not observed in the absence of cognitive load. CONCLUSIONS: Sources of attentional distraction may heighten the impact of salient smoking warnings, resulting in significant reductions in smoking...|$|R

Participants (N = 60) viewed alcoholic beverages presenting one of three <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> (No <b>health</b> <b>warning,</b> Text-only, Pictorial) and then responded to questions relating to level of fear arousal and their perceptions toward alcohol use. We found that pictorial <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> were associated with significantly higher fear arousal, increased perceptions of the health risks of consuming alcohol as well as greater intentions to reduce and quit alcohol consumption compared to the control.

Methods: twenty regular waterpipe tobacco smokers from London took part in five focus groups discussing the impact of waterpipe tobacco pack <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> on their attitudes towards waterpipe smoking. We presented them with existing and mock waterpipe tobacco products, designed to be compliant with current and future UK/EU legislation. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: participants felt packs were less attractive and <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> were more impactful as <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> increased in size and packaging became less branded. However, participants highlighted their lack of exposure to waterpipe tobacco pack <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> due to the inherent nature of waterpipe smoking, that is, smoking in a café with the apparatus already prepacked by staff. <b>Health</b> <b>warnings</b> at the point of consumption had more reported impact than <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> at the point of sale. Conclusions: waterpipe tobacco pack <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> are likely to be effective if compliant with existing laws and exposed to end-users.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundPrevious {{research}} with adults and adolescents indicates that plain cigarette packs increase visual attention to <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> among non-smokers and non-regular smokers, but not among regular smokers. This {{may be because}} regular smokers: (1) {{are familiar with the}} <b>health</b> <b>warnings,</b> (2) preferentially attend to branding, or (3) actively avoid <b>health</b> <b>warnings.</b> We sought to distinguish between these explanations using eye-tracking technology. MethodA convenience sample of 30 adult dependent smokers participated in an eye-tracking study. Participants viewed branded, plain and blank packs of cigarettes with familiar and unfamiliar <b>health</b> <b>warnings.</b> The number of fixations to <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> and branding on the different pack types were recorded. ResultsAnalysis of variance indicated that regular smokers were biased towards fixating the branding rather than the <b>health</b> <b>warning</b> on all three pack types. This bias was smaller, but still evident, for blank packs, where smokers preferentially attended the blank region over the <b>health</b> <b>warnings.</b> Time-course analysis showed that for branded and plain packs, attention was preferentially directed to the branding location for the entire 10 s of the stimulus presentation, while for blank packs this occurred for the last 8 s of the stimulus presentation. Familiarity with <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> had no effect on eye gaze location. ConclusionSmokers actively avoid cigarette pack <b>health</b> <b>warnings,</b> and this remains the case {{even in the absence of}} salient branding information. Smokers may have learned to divert their attention away from cigarette pack <b>health</b> <b>warnings.</b> These findings have implications for cigarette packaging and <b>health</b> <b>warning</b> policy...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Tobacco pack <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> are an {{effective}} channel to inform smokers {{of the dangers}} they face. The FCTC (Article 11, item 2 b) requires the rotation of <b>health</b> <b>warnings.</b> Since October 2012, 10 large (50 % of the pack surface area) graphic <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> on tobacco packaging have been introduced in Ukraine. This study aims to analyze the distribution of these 10 <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> on cigarette packs purchased by Ukrainian smokers. Material and Methods In three nationally representative cross-sectional surveys conducted in Ukraine in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and covering not less than 2000 respondents each year, during face-to-face interviews all participating smokers were asked to demonstrate a cigarette pack. The kinds of <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> were recorded. Results The distribution of 10 pictorial <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> was uneven in all three surveys but consistent over time. The most frequently printed warnings were those related to lung cancer (30 - 37 % of all current warnings on Ukrainian cigarette packs) and early death of smokers (18 - 21 %). All other warnings were only seen on 2 - 13 % of packs. The least seen were those related to benefits of quitting (2 - 6 %), skin aging (3 - 6 %) and intrauterine tobacco-related harm (3 - 5 %). Conclusions Tobacco industry consistently overproduces packs with certain <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> on tobacco packs to minimize the presentation of others. This might be caused by the industry's estimates of comparative potential impact various <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> might have on users. To properly inform smokers of various aspect of tobacco-related harm, national legislation needs to require each <b>health</b> <b>warning</b> should appear on {{an equal number of}} packages...|$|R

40|$|Background: Globally, {{smokeless}} tobacco use is disproportionately concentrated in low-and-middle income countries like India and Bangladesh. Despite the growing evidence base linking {{smokeless tobacco}} use with adverse health outcomes, {{knowledge of the}} health effects of smokeless tobacco remains low. <b>Health</b> <b>warnings</b> are a cost-effective population-level tobacco control strategy, and represent an excellent medium for communicating health information given their reach and frequency of exposure. Pictorial warnings have been shown to promote smoking cessation, and increase health knowledge and perceptions of risk, compared to text-only warnings. Much of this research, however, is largely based in high-income countries and is specific to cigarette <b>health</b> <b>warnings.</b> The current study {{was among the first to}} experimentally evaluate text and pictorial <b>health</b> <b>warning</b> labels in India and Bangladesh. Objectives: This study examined: 1) Patterns of use and perceptions of harm for different smokeless tobacco products; 2) Awareness of current <b>health</b> <b>warning</b> labeling on smokeless tobacco, as well as the extent to which respondents supported stronger <b>health</b> <b>warning</b> labeling; 3) Perceived effectiveness of text and pictorial smokeless tobacco <b>health</b> <b>warnings,</b> and a potential mediator (negative affect) and moderator (message credibility) of this association; and lastly 4) The impact of viewing <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> on attitudes and beliefs about smokeless tobacco. Methods: An experimental study was conducted in India (n= 1, 002) and Bangladesh (n= 1, 081), with adult (19 + years) smokeless tobacco users, and youth (16 to 18 years) users and non-users. Respondents were randomly assigned to view smokeless tobacco <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> according to one of four experimental conditions: (1) Text-only, (2) Pictorial warning with symbolic imagery, (3) Pictorial warning with a graphic health effect, or (4) Pictorial warning with a personalized graphic health effect and a personal testimonial. Each respondent viewed five warnings within that condition for the following health effects: (1) Oral cancer, (2) Mouth disease, (3) Heart disease, (4) Addiction, and (5) Death. Warnings within each set were shown to respondents and rated one at a time (in random order) on the following outcomes: perceived effectiveness, attention, believability (credibility), importance, surprise, fright, disgust, and unpleasantness. Results: A majority (88. 9 %) of smokeless tobacco users reported daily use. Approximately one-fifth (20. 4 %) of the sample were mixed-users (used both smoked and smokeless tobacco), of which about half (54. 4 %) reported that they primarily used smokeless over smoked forms like cigarettes or bidis. Gutkha was the most commonly used smokeless product in India, and pan masala in Bangladesh. The most commonly reported reason for using pan masala was the belief that it was “less harmful” than other types. The findings indicate strong support for <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> in general, and for <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> that included pictures in India and Bangladesh. In India—the first country in the world to carry pictorial <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> on smokeless tobacco packages—a majority of respondents still reported that <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> should have “more health information”. More than one-third of Indian respondents reported that they made an effort to avoid smokeless tobacco packages with <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> on them, indicating that users are noticing and reacting to warnings. With respect to the effectiveness of <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> with different message themes: text-only warnings were perceived as less effective than each of the pictorial styles (p< 0. 001 for all). Graphic warnings were given higher effectiveness ratings than symbolic or testimonial warnings (p< 0. 001). Few country differences were observed in the adult sample. Among youth, Indian respondents tended to give higher effectiveness ratings than their Bangladeshi counterparts. The findings also indicated that negative affect (a composite measure of surprise, fright, disgust, and unpleasantness) mediated the association between viewing <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> and ratings of perceived effectiveness for adults and youth. Among adults, moderated-mediation analyses indicated that negative affect mediated the association between viewing <b>health</b> <b>warnings</b> and ratings of perceived effectiveness at different levels of the moderator (message credibility). In other words, the association between negative affect and perceived effectiveness varied as a function of message credibility; the association was stronger when message credibility was high, and weaker when it was low. Among youth, message credibility moderated the indirect effect (mediation) only for those who had viewed <b>warnings</b> with graphic <b>health</b> effects versus personal testimonials. No differences were observed across message themes with respect to levels of agreement with negative attitudes and beliefs, or overall ‘bad’ opinions about smokeless tobacco. Conclusions: This set of findings reinforces the need to implement effective tobacco control strategies in low- and middle-income countries like India and Bangladesh. In terms of <b>health</b> <b>warning</b> message content—pictorial <b>warnings</b> depicting graphic <b>health</b> effects may have the greatest efficacy, consistent with research from high-income countries on cigarette warnings...|$|R
