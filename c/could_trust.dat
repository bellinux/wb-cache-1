5|$|Cincinnati {{already had}} a large anti-slavery {{movement}} who had violent conflicts with slavery proponents {{in the years before}} Coffin moved to the city. Coffin purchased a new home at the corner of Elm and Sixth Streets and continued to be active in the Underground Railroad. He also set up a new safe house in the city and helped organize a larger network in the area. At first he was very cautious about helping escaping slaves in the area until he was able to find local people he <b>could</b> <b>trust</b> and the community learned that it <b>could</b> <b>trust</b> him. Although Coffin and his wife moved several times during their years in Cincinnati, they finally settled at a home on Wehrman Street. With the large home's rooms rented out for boarding and its many guests coming and going, the home provided an excellent place to operate an Underground Railroad stop without arousing much suspicion. When fugitives arrived they would be dressed as butlers, cooks, and other workers in uniforms that Catherine had created. Some mulattoes were able to pass as white guests. The most frequent disguise was a Quaker woman's attire; its high collar, long sleeves, gloves, veil, and a large, wide-brimmed hat could completely hide its wearer when their head was tilted slightly downward.|$|E
5|$|Wood hired many actors she had {{previously}} worked with and felt she <b>could</b> <b>trust,</b> such as Peter Ellis, Meg Johnson, Kay Adshead and Sue Wallace. Wood also hired several celebrities {{for the show}} including Frank Bruno, Denis Healey, Claire Rayner, Pete Postlethwaite, Maureen Lipman, Hope Jackman, Molly Weir, Henry Kelly, Dora Bryan and Anne Reid (who would star with Wood again in her sitcom dinnerladies in 1999. Kelly and Bryan also made guest appearances in the sitcom).|$|E
5|$|Kōhei also meets a blind upperclassman named Misaki Kawana {{who has a}} sociable {{personality}} {{where she}} can be unreserved with anyone. A mute underclassman girl named Mio Kouzuki meets Kōhei one day and uses a sketchbook to carry on written conversations. She belongs to the drama club, and despite {{not being able to}} speak, can still show emotion through various abundant expressions. The last girl Kōhei gets to know is a childish junior high school student named Mayu Shiina who refuses to go to school. Her one and only friend she <b>could</b> <b>trust</b> in life, a ferret named Myū, dies shortly before she meets Kōhei and the other main characters.|$|E

5|$|The Huguenots {{and other}} European Protestant {{interests}} supported the nascent revolt in the Spanish Netherlands, which were provinces of Habsburg Spain. When Catholic opposition to this course in France {{resulted in the}} death of Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny and the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, Walsingham's house in Paris became a temporary sanctuary for Protestant refugees, including Philip Sidney. Ursula, who was pregnant, escaped to England with their four-year-old daughter. She gave birth to a second girl, Mary, in January 1573 while Walsingham was still in France. He returned to England in April 1573, having established himself as a competent official whom the Queen and Cecil <b>could</b> <b>trust.</b> He cultivated contacts throughout Europe, and a century later his dispatches would be published as The Complete Ambassador.|$|E
5|$|As Mulder—in Fletcher's body—is dragged {{away by the}} soldiers, Scully {{begins to}} {{question}} whether what Mulder {{told her about the}} body-swap was true. Fletcher—in Mulder's body—approaches Scully and apologizes for telling Kersh and she feigns acceptance of it. After being reprimanded, Fletcher arranges a dinner date with Scully at Mulder's apartment. Meanwhile, Mulder is confined in a cell next to the mind-switched Lana Chee. Military police arrive and take Mulder to a meeting with General Wegman, Grodin and Smoodge. They believe that Mulder-as-Fletcher was trying to defraud the FBI, not help them. Mulder bluffs his way through the meeting, and claims that the real proof is safe and that he did not tell them about the scheme because he did not know if he <b>could</b> <b>trust</b> his colleagues, thinking any one of them could be the source of the leak. Mulder returns to Fletcher's house and tells Joanne Fletcher that he is Agent Fox Mulder, but Joanne thinks her husband must be undergoing a mid-life crisis.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, Arnold sent {{a letter}} {{accepting}} Clinton's terms and proposing a meeting to André through yet another intermediary: William Heron, {{a member of the}} Connecticut Assembly whom he thought he <b>could</b> <b>trust.</b> In an ironic twist, Heron went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter and offered his own services to the British as a spy. He then took the letter back to Connecticut, suspicious of Arnold's actions, where he delivered it {{to the head of the}} Connecticut militia. General Parsons laid it aside, seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion. Four days later, Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of the wife of a prisoner of war. Eventually, a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobb's Ferry. This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river fired on his boat, not being informed of his impending arrival.|$|E

5|$|Washington again {{proposed}} to assault Boston in October, but his officers {{thought it best}} {{to wait until the}} harbor had frozen over. In February, when the water had frozen between Roxbury and Boston Common, Washington thought that in spite of his shortage in powder he would try an assault by rushing across the ice; but his officers again advised against it. Washington's desire to launch an attack on Boston arose from his fear that his army would desert in the winter, and how easily he knew that Howe could break the lines of his army in its present condition. He had not yet learned how completely he <b>could</b> <b>trust</b> in Howe's inactivity; he abandoned an attack across the ice with great reluctance in exchange for a more cautious plan, to fortify Dorchester Heights using cannon arrived from Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E
5|$|In 1552 Dudley {{was made}} a Knight of the Garter; {{at the end of}} the year he was sent on a {{diplomatic}} mission to discuss Edward VI's hopes to mediate for peace between the Empire and France. He first travelled to Brussels, where he was received by Mary of Hungary on 8 January 1553. Impatient to see the Emperor himself, he tried to intercept him on his way to Flanders. Sir Richard Morrison, the English resident ambassador with Charles V, knew nothing of this until he met Dudley at Treves. The ailing ruler was averse to be molested by diplomats while journeying, nevertheless Morrison arranged an interview at Luxembourg in which Charles referred them to a later occasion. On 11 February 1553 the Emperor gave the Englishmen an audience at Brussels. When Dudley offered to kiss his hand, he embraced him. The visitors noted that the chamber was hung with tapestries depicting the Emperor's victories at Tunis. Charles V was non-committal, declaring that he was well-disposed to peace if he only <b>could</b> <b>trust</b> the French king. On returning to England Dudley had an audience with Edward on 19 February. Jehan Scheyfve, the Emperor's agent, reported that Dudley was discreet, and only mentioned that Charles had given him a present. The French ambassador in London was not pleased. Dudley was elected MP for Oxfordshire in the March parliament of 1553, carrying Edward's train at the proceedings.|$|E
5|$|The {{power balance}} {{began to change}} after King Rajendra came of age and his grandmother, Tripurasundari, died on 26 March 1832 due to cholera. Bhimsen lost his main support and the court became a stage for a power struggle, which even though started off {{as an attempt to}} assert the King's {{authority}} from the Mukhtiyar, spread to various aristocratic clans and their attempt to secure total authority. It was no secret that Bhimsen was able to maintain his supremacy due to the large standing army under his and his family's command; and in the subsequent years, different factions would attempt to increase their influence based on the strength of the number of battalions under their grip. After Tripurasundari's death, the royal seal by which government orders were approved naturally went {{into the hands of the}} senior queen Samrajya Laxmi, who knew all too well of its powers and wanted to emulate the queens of the past by establishing her own regency. Sensing Samrajya Laxmi's ambition, Ranbir Singh started to stroke her dislike of Bhimsen in the hopes of becoming the mukhtiyar himself. Getting a whiff of this matter, Bhimsen strongly reprimanded Ranbir Singh which caused him to resign from his General's position and live in retirement in his house at Sipamandan. However, Bhimsen later managed to placate his brother, by giving him the title of Chota (Little) General, and send him to Palpa as its governor. Since he could find nobody that he <b>could</b> <b>trust</b> to keep watch over the royal palace, Bhimsen from then on started to live in an ordinary rented house located near the palace premise.|$|E

25|$|To some modern readers it {{can appear}} that some {{dynamical}} quantities recognised today {{were used in}} the Principia but not named. The mathematical aspects of the first two books were so clearly consistent that they were easily accepted; for example, Locke asked Huygens whether he <b>could</b> <b>trust</b> the mathematical proofs, and was assured about their correctness.|$|E
25|$|Barring {{any other}} difficulties, the dyamani-tigui would run the {{province}} by himself collecting taxes and procuring armies from the tribes under his command. However, territories that were crucial to trade or subject to revolt {{would receive a}} farba. Farbas were picked by the mansa from the conquering farin or family members. The only real requirement was that the mansa knew he <b>could</b> <b>trust</b> this individual to safeguard imperial interests.|$|E
25|$|He acted promptly. On {{the evening}} of 18 August, all the {{officers}} whom he thought he <b>could</b> <b>trust</b> received secret instructions to assemble in the great square facing the arsenal on the following morning. At ten o'clock on 19 August, Gustav mounted his horse and rode to the arsenal. On the way, his adherents joined him in little groups, as if by accident, {{so that by the}} time he reached his destination he had about 200 officers in his suite.|$|E

25|$|With all of Humayun's {{brothers}} now dead, {{there was}} no fear of another usurping his throne during his military campaigns. He was also now an established leader and <b>could</b> <b>trust</b> his generals. With this new-found strength Humayun embarked {{on a series of}} military campaigns aimed at extending his reign over areas in eastern and western India. His sojourn in exile seems to have reduced his reliance on astrology, and his military leadership came to imitate the more effective methods that he had observed in Persia.|$|E
25|$|As the Soviets {{advanced}} on Budapest, the Sixth Army {{was ordered}} to Budapest on October 12 where Farkas was briefly named commander of the Pest bridgehead. Regent Miklós Horthy also wanted military units in Budapest commanded by officers he <b>could</b> <b>trust,</b> as he planned to announce an armistice with the Soviet Union as Romania had done, abandoning the lost Axis cause which he had never fully embraced. Germany feared the surrender of Hungary, knowing this would leave their entire southern flank open to Soviet attack.|$|E
25|$|Lewis {{was still}} under {{contract}} with Sun Records, and kept recording, regularly releasing singles. He had gone from $10,000 a night for concerts to $250 a night for engagements in beer joints and small clubs. At {{the time he had}} few friends whom he felt he <b>could</b> <b>trust.</b> It was only through Kay Martin, the president of Lewis's fan club, T. L. Meade (also known as Franz Douskey), an occasional Memphis musician and friend of Sam Phillips, and Gary Skala, that Lewis went back to record at Sun Records.|$|E

5000|$|In these letters, Paetus accused Antiochus IV, Epiphanes and Callinicus of disloyalty to the Emperor. It is {{not known}} whether these accusations were true or false. After reading the letters Vespasian felt that he <b>could</b> longer <b>trust</b> the family of Antiochus IV and that he <b>could</b> not <b>trust</b> them to protect the {{strategic}} crossing at the Euphrates River at Samosata. Vespasian gave orders to Antiochus IV to terminate his rule in Commagene.|$|R
25|$|Hooker {{embarked}} on a much-needed reorganization of the army, doing away with Burnside's grand division system, which had proved unwieldy; he also no longer had sufficient senior officers on hand that he <b>could</b> <b>trust</b> to command multi-corps operations. He organized the cavalry into a separate corps {{under the command of}} Brig. Gen. George Stoneman (who had commanded the III Corps at Fredericksburg). But while he concentrated the cavalry into a single organization, he dispersed his artillery battalions to the control of the infantry division commanders, removing the coordinating influence of the army's artillery chief, Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt.|$|E
25|$|After a brief hiatus in Spain {{spent at}} a villa {{belonging}} to Island Records' head, Chris Blackwell, Drake returned to London refreshed, and in October 1971 approached record engineer and producer John Wood. Wood {{had worked with}} Drake on his previous two albums {{and was one of}} the few people Drake felt he <b>could</b> <b>trust.</b> Wood has worked with other artists such as Fairport Convention, Cat Stevens, and Pink Floyd, and he often worked in partnership with record producer Joe Boyd. Boyd produced Drake's first two albums with Wood acting as sound engineer. Although Wood primarily focused on the engineering of an album, he often contributed as a producer.|$|E
25|$|For {{both his}} {{security}} needs and touring support, Presley hired people chosen from among those he <b>could</b> <b>trust</b> and depend on to manage his public appearances. This entourage included first cousins {{and several of}} Presley's friends from his boyhood in a poor Memphis housing project plus {{junior and senior high}} school friends and early employees from Memphis such as Alan Fortas, nephew of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas. Many people were employed with the group through the years but some of the more prominent members were Joe Esposito, Lamar Fike, Alan Fortas, Marty Lacker, Billy Smith, Richard Davis, Red West, Sonny West, Dave Hebler, Al Strada, Dr. Nick, Larry Geller, Charlie Hodge, Jerry Schilling, Sam Thompson and Gene Smith.|$|E
