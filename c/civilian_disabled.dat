5000|$|States of European {{continent}} {{took the}} issue of disability after the World War I when disability protection system was covering only war veterans, soldiers. This system {{was based on the}} conviction that people are owned this protection (quotas) for those who have hurt protecting their country, that was known as a Quid pro quo duty, what meant something for something. Everything changed in the post World War II period. War left Europe in devastated condition. Millions of people were irreversible injured. That lead to the very high level of unemployment among the disabled parts of societies. After 1945, European states were forced by this situation to made employers to employ disabled veterans. Later those post War quatas were extended into the <b>disabled</b> <b>civilians.</b>|$|R

The film opens with a space battle between the USS Enterprise and a Klingon ship {{that turns out to}} be a simulation: the Kobayashi Maru test for cadets pursuing the command track at Starfleet Academy. This simulation confronts the subject with a moral and strategic dilemma. Should she rescue the <b>disabled</b> <b>civilian</b> vessel Kobayashi Maru if it means violating a peace treaty with the Klingons and the risk of war, or should he observe the spatial proscriptions of the treaty and abandon the ship to certain extinction? The city Amber on Tau Ceti IV is the homeport of the 3rd class neutronic fuel carrier Kobayashi Maru, and her master Kojiro Vance.|$|R

In the incident in January 2000, Captain Eduard Ulman's unit killed a civilian and subsequently extrajudicially executed five more with silenced weapons; the commandos then burned the bodies in the victims' vehicle. They were found not guilty in a retrial on May 19, 2005. Although the four admitted the killings, {{the court ruled that}} their actions were not punishable as they had been following orders. The acquittals of Cpt. Ulman and his three subordinates sparked a public outrage in Chechnya, where rights advocates and many Chechens say Russian forces act with impunity. During the third court hearing Ulman and the two officers mysteriously disappeared.http://www.newizv.ru/news/2007-04-13/67868/http://www.gazeta.ru/2007/04/12/oa_236492.shtml ...|$|R
50|$|Community {{services}} are {{the cornerstone of}} New Zealand Red Cross work. Two of these services {{have a long history}} in New Zealand - Community Transport and Meals On Wheels. Community Transport grew from the transportation of sick and wounded returned servicemen to medical appointments and outings in World War II. After the war the Transport Corps extended their activities to <b>disabled</b> <b>civilians</b> as well as servicemen. Community Transport continues to take people to doctor appointments and hospital visits who otherwise {{may not be able to}} get there. The Meals On Wheels programme was started in June 1951 by the North Canterbury Red Cross Centre during a gas, coal and electricity shortage when the volunteers decided to make soup for people in need. A local café proprietor, offered to cook stock for the soup and deliver it for free and a local butcher supplied the bones and meat for the soup to Red Cross free of charge. In 2014, 544,843 meals were delivered around New Zealand.|$|R
40|$|Asymmetric warfare is {{creating}} a new frontierfor bioethics as military organizations rushto develop nonlethal, medicalized weapons. Faced with small but increasingly sophisticated guer-rilla organizations that intermingle at will with the civilian population, the United States {{and many of its}} allies are searching for ways to disable insurgents while minimizing harm to civilians. One avenue is to build increasingly sophisticated “precision-guided munitions”—“smart, ” high-explosive bombs that, in theory, zero in on and destroy their targets without widespread collateral damage. However, these weapons—the purview of electronics and ballistic experts—can only go so far. Very often, there are no clearly defined guerrilla targets, or, as often happens, the targets are destroyed early on. Nonlethal weapons are an increasingly attractive option for rooting out insurgents without bringing catastrophic harm to <b>civilians.</b> Rather than <b>disabling</b> or killing enemy forces by causing traumatic injury, nonlethal weapons temporarily incapacitate their targets by causing physical distress, disorientation, or unconsciousness. These weapons are “medicalized” in that they rely on advances in neuroscience, physi-“Medicalized ” weapons—those that rely on advances in neuroscience, physiology, and pharmacology—offer the prospect of reducing casualties and protecting civilians. They could be especially useful in modern asymmetric wars in which conventional states are pitted against guerrilla or insurgent forces. But may physicians and other medical workers participate in their development...|$|R
5000|$|According to Human Rights Watch and Memorial, {{more than}} 2,000 civilians were {{stranded}} in no man's land {{for three days}} during the battle. On the second day,the Russian forces said that women and children could leave, but they were discouraged {{to do so by}} Chechen troops, possibly aiming to use them as human shields.This resulted in civilian casualties during the subsequent hostilities. Up to 100 <b>civilians,</b> mainly elderly, <b>disabled,</b> or wounded, were trapped in the village and may {{have been killed in the}} course of the battle. A number of male civilians were singled out, beaten, and taken to an improvised detention center in Urus-Martan for torture, including to the death. Civilian survivors said refugees were allowed to return to the village for one hour to take their belongings, but were killed during renewed Russian bombing. Others related witnessing organized looting, with [...] "truckloads of booty" [...] being hauled off by Russian forces. They stated they were able to evacuate from the battle zone after a group of pro-Moscow Chechen militia policemen forced the Russian checkpoint at gunpoint to let them pass. Abdula Itslayev, the head of the neighbouring village of Goyskoye, said that there were heavy civilian casualties and claimed to know whole families who had been wiped out.|$|R
40|$|Background: the 34 -year-long, Guatemalan war left {{at least}} 1, 841 persons {{disabled}} in the country. {{the aim of}} this study was to describe the prevalence of mental disorders in individuals who acquired their disability as a result of the war, and to identify probable risk factors. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted of a group of 99 civilians with a disability in Guatemala. Participants were selected from four <b>civilian</b> organizations serving <b>disabled</b> persons in the municipality of Nebaj, Quiche. the diagnostic instrument was the computerized version of the Composite International Diagnostic Instrument 2. 1 (CIDI 2. 1). Data were collected from 2002 to 2004. Results: of the 99 disabled persons who completed the interview, 44 had some type of lifetime psychiatric disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was the most prevalent, with 34. 34 % (34 cases), followed by dysthymia, with 10. 10 % (10 cases), and depression, with 6. 06 % (6 cases). Conclusion: the traumatic events experienced during the conflict caused long-term psychological sequelae in people who were disabled as a result of the war. Increased exposure to traumatic events, being married, physical disability, illiteracy and advanced age were identified as probable risk factors for mental disorders.

40|$|Disability and Personhood are two {{ideas that}} meet in unfortunate circumstances. Persons with disabilities have their identities {{challenged}} {{as they are}} repeatedly seen as persons with less social stature. They are overlooked in obtaining jobs {{and when they do}} have jobs, they are overlooked for promotion as they are seen as less able to perform the duties the job requires. Persons with disabilities are subject to the stares of others, often a focus of the ire of the public for perceived advantages such as specialty parking. Recent civil rights law protects their rights, but the public is slow to accommodate the needs of this class of people. Cities still run special paratransit lines rather than modify their city buses, perpetuating 'separate but equal'. It is an issue found in our literature and disabled children do not have same educational access as those that are able bodied. Public perception and public reaction is of national concern, especially when the needs of the few seem to trample on the needs of the many. Disabled lives matter, the same as the able bodied. Public perception of our returning soldiers is admirable and it is spilling over into the lives of <b>disabled</b> <b>civilians.</b> It is an issue that needs wider acknowledgement and effort from everyday people to permit disabled persons to live fuller lives.

5000|$|The century {{began as}} had the {{previous}} one. This period of quiet lasted for {{almost the entire}} {{first half of the}} twentieth century, with no particular significant events. In this period, the Scuola del Libro (Istituto per la Decorazione e l'Illustrazione del Libro) was founded and expressed considerable talent both nationally and internationally. In addition to the artistic development from the Scuola del Libro, Urbino also began to grow as a university town, with the elevation to university faculty of nineteenth-century School of Pharmacy and the birth of the department of Education (approximately 1934). Due to these changes in the University, an increase in the student population led to housing shortages that highlighted the state of total unpreparedness of the city, so much that for the first time many students were housed in the homes of private citizens. The problem was partly solved with the establishment of the male boarding school [...] "Raphael" [...] at the beginning of the century, and the female boarding school [...] "Laura Battiferri" [...] in approximately 1926. This period was dominated by great events of national and international history, which inevitably were expressed in Urbino. The period of the fascist dictatorship left its mark on the city, especially from an architectural point of view, with a fascist elementary school [...] "Giovanni Pascoli" [...] (1932) built on the ancient Garden of Saint Lucia (part of the duke’s private gardens), the restoration of the palace-Mauruzi Gherardi, then the seat of the court, as well as the Student House, to compensate for the shortage of accommodation as a result of the large increase in university population and housing for the maimed and <b>disabled</b> <b>civilians.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsing the categorisations {{which have}} helped to build the field of {{disability}} in France, this article analyses the meanings of disability and how they shifted over the 20 th century. Our aim is to identify, from a holistic perspective, both {{the conditions under which}} they were produced and the major paradigms in which they were rooted. The initial category thus originates in the moral division of poverty which was part of mediaeval Christianity and which, in the 14 th century, put forward inaptitude for work as a legitimate reason for assistance. At the end of the 19 th century and the start of the 20 th century, solidarism and the principle of social debt opened the way for redress for the damage caused by society: financial redress to begin with, then redress in the sense of “rehabilitation” {{within the context of a}} war economy. Breaking down the boundaries of inaptitude, these new procedures made a distinction between people disabled through war or accidents at work – which came under the heading of collective responsibility – and <b>disabled</b> <b>civilians.</b> Within their groups, the latter therefore produced and distributed a new meaning: disability “as an épreuve of the self”, a category of experience which was to find support from various vulgates of human and social sciences. However, the result was different acceptances of the meaning of épreuve; although these had in common the fact that they focused attention on the person, they were accompanied by distinct modalities for the social treatment of disability. The vicissitudes of meanings of disability “as an épreuve” illustrate the movement of reflexivity and subjectivity which drive our late modernity and its effects on current social policies and practices...|$|R
