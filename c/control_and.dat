40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine {{relationship}} between use strategic human capital (usefulness, behavioral uncertainty, firm specifity and spread of shc) on design management control system (personal <b>controls,</b> traditional <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> non- traditional <b>controls).</b> The contributes of this research for theory development, particularly for management control system, besides contributes to managerial practices to trade offs manager make between different types of controls when designing the MCS. The data were collected by mail survey and contact person. Applying convenience sampling method, this study has collected 105 middle manager from 21 manufacturing firms in Indonesia. The hyphoteses are tested using Two Step Approach to SEM technique by Lisrel 8. 54 and SPSS version 11. The results show that usefulness and spread of strategic human capital correlated positively by personal <b>controls,</b> traditional <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> non-traditional <b>controls.</b> Behavioral uncertainty doesn’t correlated to personal controls but it correlated with traditional <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> non-traditional <b>controls.</b> Firm specifity correlated to by personal <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> but it doesn’t related with traditional <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> non-traditional <b>controls.</b> Spread of shc correlated by personal controls but it doesn’t related with traditional <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> non-traditional <b>controls.</b> Keyword: Usefulness, Behavioral Uncertainty, Firm Specifity, Spread of SHC, Personal Controls, Traditional Controls dan Non-Traditional Controls, Two Step Approach to SEM. ...|$|R
