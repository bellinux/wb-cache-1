40|$|Abstract-This paper {{compares the}} {{performance}} of the reclaim asphalt pavement (RAP) mixes prepared with the foamed bitumen. Four different percentages of foamed bitumen namely 1 %, 2 %, 3 % and 4 % were used in preparation of the mixes. Mixes prepared with 50 % RAP and 50 % <b>crusher</b> <b>run</b> (Mix B) were compared with mixes prepared with 100 % <b>crusher</b> <b>run</b> (Mix A) which performed as a control sample. Performance of the mixes based on indirect tensile strength test (ITS) in different conditions namely cured at 40 oC for 72 hours and soaked for 24 hours at 25 oC was evaluated. The test results indicated that incorporating RAP to the mixes shows insignificant difference in ITS value but also increase the resistance to moisture damage. However ITS value is significantly affected by the foamed bitumen content which 2 % of foamed bitumen results in optimum ITS.

40|$|With recent {{focus on}} {{sustainable}} construction practices and the ever-increasing transportation cost and scarcity of natural resources, use of unconventional aggregate materials, such as primary <b>crusher</b> <b>run</b> and concrete demolition waste, have become viable {{for the construction}} of pavement working platforms over very weak and often wet subgrade soils. To this end, a research study was undertaken at the Illinois Center for Transportation to evaluate the adequacy and field performances of such large-sized aggregate materials and validate new material specifications. A state-of-the-art image analysis technique was utilized to characterize the size and morphological properties, e. g. shape, texture and angularity of two large-sized aggregates, referred to herein as primary <b>crusher</b> <b>run</b> and crushed concrete. For the field evaluation, full-scale test sections were constructed with these large-sized aggregate materials over a very weak engineered subgrade and subjected to accelerated pavement testing. Construction quality control was achieved through in-place density and modulus measurements on conventional aggregate capping surface layers using nuclear gauge, lightweight deflectometer and soil stiffness gauge type devices. Periodic rut measurements were carried out on the pavement surface throughout the accelerated loading process using an Accelerated Transportation Loading Assembly (ATLAS). Contributions of the underlying pavement layers to the total rut accumulation was evaluated through innovative applications of ground penetrating radar (GPR), a light weight penetrometer device, known as the French Panda, as well as a geo-endoscopy probe. Layer intermixing and material migration at the aggregate subgrade and subgrade interface was found to improve the layer stiffness and pavement performance results significantly...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of recycled glass in construction, {{such as its}} application in highway pavement construction, concrete oversite and flooring has been occurring {{over the past couple}} of decades. In recent years, the discovery of several economic and environmental benefits has increased the use of recycled glass most especially in highway construction and precast concrete members such as wall panel, table tops and so many other concrete products, making the evaluation of the properties of glass and aggregate mixes necessary. The uses of recycled glass are varied depending on the specific application. Crushed recycled glass, or cullet, has been independently, and has also been blended with natural stone aggregate at different replacement rates. The research provides an evaluation of the potential use of glass cullet when used in combination with natural coarse aggregate for slab construction. This research studied the strength and the density characteristics of different glass-aggregate blend to examine the effects of blending glass cullet into concrete by partial replacement of the coarse aggregate. A source of natural aggregate was tested, ’ GRANITE ’ it being <b>crusher</b> <b>run</b> and very angular in nature. The glass was introduced into the concrete mix at the replacement rates of 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 % and 100 % the maximum size of glass cullet is 20 mm...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the 1999 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 30 and 31, Athens, Georgia. To lessen {{soil erosion}} {{due to high}} animal {{stocking}} rates on small Georgia dairies, the Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS) recommends a system that utilizes geotextile material covered with <b>crusher</b> <b>run</b> gravel as a soil cover in high animal traffic areas. Soil erosion is dramatically reduced, yet due to the large accumulation of manure, questions remain concerning water quality with these systems. At a 120 cow dairy in Oglethorpe county Georgia, a loafing lot utilizing this system was constructed on a Pacolet sandy loam soil (clayey, kaolinitic, thermic, Typic Kanhapludult). Runoff water and leachate were characterized by storm events for water balance and chemical information. Surface runoff water typically contained levels of NH₄-N, and P₄-P that exceeded EPA guidelines for surface water. Sub-surface drainage intercepted by tile drains had N₃-N levels ranging from 10 to 40 ppm exceeding the EPA drinking water standard. It is recommended that surface water running off improved loafing lots either be routed to a wastewater lagoon for irrigation, or to adjacent hay fields to reduce the impact of excess nutrients to surface waters.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 26 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 9 - 12 July 2007 "The challenges of implementing policy?", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT:This paper describes an update and overview {{of the use of}} Bitumen-Rubber (BR) in South Africa. The South African experience with the transfer of the Bitumen-Rubber Technology to mainland China is also discussed briefly. The design procedures and construction practices used for the construction of Bitumen-Rubber Asphalt in rehabilitation projects in South Africa are also discussed. Bitumen- Rubber Asphalt / Hot Mix Asphalt (BRHMA) is normally used where the other asphalts have already failed or where the existing base courses are in severe distress. In addition they must also provide additional structural capacity for 10 to 15 years under severe traffic conditions. This paper describes and discusses the following aspects -The constituent materials used in the manufacture of BR binder and the BRHMA. The South African materials specification is furnished and discussed. -The SA asphalt mix design process including the type selection; the volumetric design process and the BRHMA end point specification. -Further developments (rutting, fatigue, energy methods, moisture sensitivity, Dynamic Creep). -BRHMA structural equivalency which is based on the work done by the CSIR on behalf of the California Department of Transport (CALTRANS). -Construction of BRHMA. -Environmental aspects and costs related to this technology. -A South African experience in the introduction of this technology to mainland China. Summary and Conclusions The perception that the cost of BRA is higher than conventional or polymer asphalt fails {{to take into account the}} costs related to -The use of reduced thicknesses of BRHMA versus other asphalts as per the CALTRANS / CSIR Projects -Savings in traffic accommodation and bypasses when alternative <b>crusher</b> <b>run</b> designs are used. -The cost implications related to the environmental issue of disposing of scrap tyres.
