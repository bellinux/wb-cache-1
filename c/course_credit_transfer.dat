40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 The master's Thesis entitled, A {{literature}} review: Exploring {{the relationship}} between student engagement and two-year college transfer rates, suggests transfer {{students are more likely}} to persist if two- and four-year institutions collaborate to engage students with accurate and timely advising and support with emphasis on how <b>course</b> <b>credits</b> <b>transfer</b> and financial aid. Factors associated with transfer student engagement are highlighted, including building a transfer-oriented culture, learning communities and focusing on engaging students in the classroom. Nationally, policy makers are increasingly encouraging enrollment at community colleges as a path toward increasing educational attainment, yet researchers note transfer rates are low. Authors also note a lack of research on community college students; most studies are performed with traditional-age students at four-year campuses. There is less research examining why transfer-ready students don't transfer. Best practices are highlighted, along with recommendations for further research...|$|R

40|$|Whilst {{arrangements}} for <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> exist across the UK {{higher education sector}} {{little is known about}} <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> students or why they re-engage with study.

A common theme of “unfinished business” appeared to dominate these accounts and a narrative-oriented analysis of the findings revealed the role of <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> in enabling students to complete varied personal projects or forms of “unfinished business”.
