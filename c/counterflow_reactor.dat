40|$|Integration of {{innovative}} steps into new advanced processes {{have the potential}} to reduce costs for producing liquid fuels. In this program, objective is to develop a new approach to liquefaction that generates an all distillate product slate at a reduced cost of about US$ 25 /barrel of crude oil equivalent. A <b>Counterflow</b> <b>Reactor</b> was developed in cooperation with GfK mbH, Germany. Advantages are low hydrogen recycle rates and low feed preheating requirements. Coal/heavy oil slurry is injected into the top of the reactor while the recycle gas and make up hydrogen is introduced into the bottom; hydrogenation products are withdrawn from the top. PU study resulted in distillable oil yields up to 74 wt % on feed (dry ash free) from coprocessing feed slurries containing 40 wt % Vesta subbituminous coal and 60 wt % Cold Lake heavy vacuum tower bottoms. Technologies developed separately by CED and ARC were combined. A 1 -kg/hr integrated continuous flow bench scale unit was constructed at the ARC site in Devon, Alberta, based on modifications to a unit at Nisku, Alberta (the modified unit was used in the preliminary economic evaluation) ...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} an experimental and theoretical study of coupled chemical kinetic and mass transport processes during leaching of pyrite from coal in a <b>counterflow,</b> "trickle-bed" column <b>reactor.</b> Spatial and temporal data on reactant and product concentrations {{were used as}} solutions to appropriate continuity equations, which in turn define chemical kinetic reaction rates. Data from four 180 -by 30 -cm column leaching experiments using coal, coal waste, and air-water and air-FeC 13 lixiviants have been analyzed. The rate of leaching {{was found to be}} diffusion limited (probably by Fe 3 +) and not controlled by bacterial action. Rates of pyrite oxidation were found to vary with elapsed time (80 to 225 days) and followed a bell-shaped curve, sometimes with a delay before start of reaction. Maximum rates of reaction ranged from 3 to 10 (mmol/d) /L (column) for coal waste and 0. 4 (mmol/d) /L (column) for coal. Reaction was 30 to SO pct complete, probably due to precipitation of product salts (e. g., jarosites), which impede transport of oxidant through the coal. An absorption-desorption model of solids leaching, which considers the role of heterogeneous porosity in solids leaching, was used to describe time-dependent leaching rates...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study has}} been performed to obtain basic knowledge of Mild combustion in which the fuel stream is preheated and diluted with various amounts of burned gas {{as well as the}} oxidizer stream. This situation occurs in application of Mild combustion in furnaces in which the burned gas might entrain into fuel and/or oxidizer streams via internal recirculation. For this purpose, a numerical model has been employed which consists of a network of plug flow <b>reactors,</b> <b>counterflow</b> diffusion flame solver and an equilibrium solver for generation of the burned gas. Detailed chemistry and multi-component transport model including Soret and Dufour effects have been used for the calculations. Stationary behavior of the model shows a considerable decrease in flame peak temperature with increasing dilution ratio for fuel dilution case as well as oxidizer dilution case. A decrease of the flame peak temperature is accompanied by a decrease of the NO formation. Further analysis of the NO reaction kinetics turned out that the prompt NO route plays a dominant role in the total NO formation. These observations were the motivation to investigate the autoignition behavior of each dilution case to study consequences of the application of each case. It appears that the most reactive mixture fraction is highly dependent on the dilution case and it can occur {{in a wide range of}} mixture fractions for different dilution cases. For a detailed comparison of autoignition behavior of dilution cases, the role of chemical and diffusion effects in this behavior has been clarified. Dilution ratio has been founded as a dominant parameter to control chemical effects and strain rate as a parameter to control diffusion effects. Dilution ratio appears to be an important parameter to determine the order of autoignition between dilution cases. Increasing strain rate delays the autoignition of dilution cases differently for each dilution case...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{computational}} {{methods have}} been developed for the simulation of aerosol dynamics and transport. Two different coupled aerosol-computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are discussed. One is a full Eulerian model and the other is a boundary layer-type streamtube model. The streamtube-based sectional model is able to provide an accurate solution of model equations within a reasonable computing time. For a number of studies, one-dimensional simulations are sufficient. Flow dependence can be taken from CFD simulations, flow correlations, or from experimentally-based estimates of time-temperature histories. While {{the focus is on the}} sectional method, a bivariate extension of the quadrature method of moments (QMOM) has also been tested. The method is shown to be able to provide reasonable computational representations of aerosol particle shape evolution. The models have been used to analyse various cases of aerosol formation, growth and deposition. Aerosol formation and growth dynamics simulations are used in analyses of aerosol formation experiments in a laminar flow reactor, experiments of particle property evolution in a <b>counterflow</b> diffusion flame <b>reactor,</b> and aerosol formation mechanisms in recovery boilers. Computational simulations of recovery boilers demonstrate the feasibility of Na 2 SO 4 -route fume formation mechanism theory. The accordance between particle size distribution predictions and experimental data is fairly good. Model studies of deposition provide insights into the transfer mechanisms of fly ash particles and inorganic vapours to the heat transfer surfaces of industrial boilers. Estimates of deposition velocities are obtained for particles of various sizes and inorganic vapours under various conditions. An area in which aerosol dynamics and transport processes are especially significant is the case of alkali chloride deposition. For these species, there seems to be a great deal of variation in the proportions of particle and vapour deposition in the typical temperature range of biofuel fired boiler superheater conditions. In recovery boilers, particle deposition is predicted to be the dominant final alkali chloride deposition mechanism for freshly soot-blown superheater surfaces, while direct vapour deposition can be equally important when there is an insulating deposit layer, and, consequently, higher temperatures at the deposit surface. The total rate of alkali chloride deposition does not have as strong a temperature dependence. While homogeneous nucleation is predicted to be negligible in recovery boiler superheater tube boundary layers, the reverse is true for conditions resembling fluidised beds during bio- and mixed fuel combustion. The relationship between deposit-related problems, such as fouling, slagging and corrosion, and the rate of deposition is not necessarily straightforward. Initial steps have been taken to simulate deposit transformations in order to provide computational demonstrations of the implications of alkali chloride deposition. A model that links alkali chloride deposition to the presence of HCl in the deposit-metal interface has been developed and illustrative simulations have been carried out. Overall, the models are shown to provide an insight into aerosol dynamics and transport phenomena in various systems. It is noted that the development of a universal CFD-based aerosol model is difficult. Instead, it is often more appropriate to make suitable simplifying assumptions, such as a parabolic flow, a constant size distribution shape or a reduction to one dimension. Suitable assumptions allow the use of computationally efficient and accurate methods. These make it possible to extend the scope of modelling beyond aerosol issues, for a more extensive analysis. reviewe...|$|R
