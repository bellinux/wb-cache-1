5|$|The Rhynia {{plant was}} small and stick-like, with simple dichotomously {{branching}} stems without leaves, each tipped by a sporangium. The simple form echoes that of the sporophyte of mosses, {{and it has been}} shown that Rhynia had an alternation of generations, with a corresponding gametophyte in the form of crowded tufts of diminutive stems only a few millimetres in height. Rhynia thus falls midway between mosses and early vascular plants like ferns and <b>clubmosses.</b> From a carpet of moss-like gametophytes, the larger Rhynia sporophytes grew much like simple <b>clubmosses,</b> spreading by means of horizontal growing stems growing rhizoids that anchored the plant to the substrate. The unusual mix of moss-like and vascular traits and the extreme structural simplicity of the plant had huge implications for botanical understanding.|$|E
5|$|Wallace visits Menado on the {{northeast}} coast of Celebes. The people of the Minahasa region are fair-skinned, unlike {{anywhere else in the}} archipelago. He stays high in the mountains by the coffee plantations, and is often cold, but finds that the animals are no different from those lower down. The forest was full of orchids, bromeliads, <b>clubmosses</b> and mosses. He experiences an earthquake, but the low timber-framed houses survive with little damage. He finds that the people, under the guidance of missionaries, are the most hard-working, peaceful and civilised of the whole archipelago. He obtains (apparently by purchase) skulls of the babirusa (pig-deer) and the rare sapiutan (midget buffalo).|$|E
500|$|The {{bodies of}} {{vascular}} plants including <b>clubmosses,</b> ferns and [...] seed plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms) generally have aerial and subterranean subsystems. The shoots consist of stems bearing green photosynthesising leaves and reproductive structures. The underground vascularised roots bear root hairs at their tips and generally lack chlorophyll. Non-vascular plants, the liverworts, hornworts and mosses {{do not produce}} ground-penetrating vascular roots {{and most of the}} plant participates in photosynthesis. The sporophyte generation is nonphotosynthetic in liverworts but may be able to contribute part of its energy needs by photosynthesis in mosses and hornworts.|$|E

500|$|The strictest {{definition}} of [...] "plant" [...] includes only the [...] "land plants" [...] or embryophytes, which include seed plants (gymnosperms, including the pines, and flowering plants) and the free-sporing cryptogams including ferns, <b>clubmosses,</b> liverworts, hornworts and mosses. Embryophytes are multicellular eukaryotes descended from an ancestor that obtained its energy from sunlight by photosynthesis. They have life cycles with alternating haploid and diploid phases. The sexual haploid phase of embryophytes, {{known as the}} gametophyte, nurtures the developing diploid embryo sporophyte within its tissues for {{at least part of}} its life, even in the seed plants, where the gametophyte itself is nurtured by its parent sporophyte. Other groups of organisms that were previously studied by botanists include bacteria (now studied in bacteriology), fungi (mycology) – including lichen-forming fungi (lichenology), non-chlorophyte algae (phycology), and viruses (virology). However, attention is still given to these groups by botanists, and fungi (including lichens) and photosynthetic protists are usually covered in introductory botany courses.|$|E

2500|$|There are no native {{tree species}} on the archipelago, {{although}} two species of bushes, fachine and native box are found. Other vegetation consists of grasses and ferns. Around 363 species of vascular plants, 21 species of ferns and <b>clubmosses</b> and 278 species of flowering plants have been recorded on the islands. Of the vascular plants, 171 {{are believed to be}} native and 13 to be endemic. Some bogs and fens exist and support some freshwater plant species, but these are not common on the islands. Tussac grass, which averages [...] in height but can reach up to , is found within 300m (1,000ft) of the coast where it forms bands around larger islands. The dense canopies formed create an insulated micro-climate suitable for many birds and invertebrates. The pale maiden (Olsynium filifolium) is the islands' proposed national flower.|$|E
