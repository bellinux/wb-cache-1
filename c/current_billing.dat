By the late 1970s, however, billing statements no longer contained these enclosures, but rather a summary statement showing posting date, purchase date, reference number, merchant name, and the dollar amount of each purchase.

Initially, a [...] "previous balance" [...] method was used—calculation of finance charge on the unpaid balance shown on the prior month's statement.

40|$|Today, billing {{is a big}} {{challenge}} for service providers. With {{a growing number of}} rich services such as music, mobile TV, Video-on-Demand and eHealth delivered to the mass market, service providers are missing business opportunities because <b>current</b> <b>billing</b> solutions are not fully capable. In particular, the delivery of on-the-fly composite services, composed of many service components provided by different service providers causes many complexities. This book proposes a billing system that deals with these inter-domain complexities. Moreover, the billing system provides an interim charging mechanism that allows for monitoring and updating of customer credit balances in near real-time. The system is designed to support large-scaled transactions and can be implemented in a commercial environment. Since billing is an expensive business process due to its complexity and high transaction volumes service providers may decide to delegate their billing processes to third parties in order to reduce operational costs. Additionally, the presented billing system can be applied to such a business model...|$|E

40|$|Fraud is {{a crucial}} problem in the {{telecommunications}} industry {{and is expected to}} increase in future convergent networks, commonly referred to as Next-Generation Networks (NGNs). Indeed due to the convergent nature of NGNs, it is highly likely that fraud from traditionally separate entities will converge and that new forms of fraud targeted at content rather than connection will emerge. Some examples include illegal redistribution of service and unauthorized access to services. Unfortunately, fraud management systems (FMSs) deployed to detect fraud on current networks are not equipped to effectively address this emerging threat and need to be revised accordingly. As the main source of input data of FMSs is generated by billing systems, determining NGN billing systems requirements is the first step to the design of an FMS suitable for future networks. Some of these requirements have been identified but cannot be satisfied by <b>current</b> <b>billing</b> systems due to the proprietary and static format of their CDRs (Call Detail Records) i. e. the records capturing the service usage of the network users. A promising solution to these problems is the recently developed Internet Protocol Detail Record (IPDR) standard. This research paper therefore examines the IPDR solution and demonstrates how it can help meet the identified NGN billing requirements. The paper also shows how the IPDR standard can improve the fraud detection success rate of potential fraud types in NGNs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Current</b> <b>billing</b> {{practices}} and mandates to report surgical outcomes are disincentives to surgical treatment of obese patients, {{who are at}} increased risk for longer hospital stays and higher complication rates. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the independent association between body mass index (BMI) and waiting time for kidney transplantation to identify potential provider bias against surgical treatment of the obese. A secondary data analysis was performed of a prospective cohort of 132, 353 patients who were registered for kidney transplantation in the United States between 1995 and 2006. Among all patients awaiting kidney transplantation, the likelihood of receiving a transplant decreased with increasing degree of obesity, categorized by ranges of BMI (adjusted hazard ratios 0. 96 for overweight, 0. 93 for obese, 0. 72 for severely obese, and 0. 56 for morbidly obese, compared with a reference group of patients with normal BMI). Similarly, the likelihood of being bypassed when an organ became available increased in a graded manner with category of obesity (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1. 02 for overweight, 1. 05 for obese, 1. 11 for severely obese, and 1. 22 for morbidly obese). Although matching an available organ with an appropriate recipient requires clinical judgment, which could not be fully captured in this study, the observed differences are dramatic and warrant further studies to understand this effect better and to design a system that is less susceptible to unintended bias...|$|E

In discussing attorney dissatisfaction, some authors have relied on the results of studies of law students and attorneys, noting that there is a limited amount of empirical data {{on the state of the}} profession. In an attempt to help fill the gap, I conducted an empirical study to gauge the effects of billable hour pressure and practices on the current crop of associates. The information obtained in my study provides guidance in both analyzing problems and formulating workable solutions.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The General Services Administration (GSA) awarded FTS 2001 contracts to Sprint and MCI Worldcom to provide long distance telecommunications services to federal agencies. The federal government began the sizable and complex effort of switching from the existing FTS 2000 contracts to FTS 2001 in June 1999. Several implementation issues have delayed this transition. One of these issues concerns the billing problems experienced by GSA and its contractors. GAO found that the billing problems often arose from changes in contracts and services. According GSA, these issues also arose from the differences between contractors' commercial billing practices and the government's practices. Because these billing problems were not promptly resolved, they had an adverse effect on the transition progress. GSA is taking steps to resolve <b>current</b> <b>billing</b> problems. It is tracking issues as they arise, {{and it is now}} trying to resolve 12 issues still outstanding with Sprint and MCI WorldCom, including the problem of commercial billing. In addition, GSA's Office of Inspector General recently began a review of the FTS 2001 billing area, which might also identify ways to prevent future billing problems. Another issue that affected the transition progress concerns the databases that supported the transition process. GAO found that although GSA developed an automated system to track transition data and develop reports, the FTS 2001 contractors did not furnish GSA with the data it needed to populate that management system's database. As a result, GSA and agency transition managers did not receive the timely and up-to-date information they needed to effectively plan and manage transition activities. ...|$|E

Motivated by these restrictions, it seemed not only sensible but very important to assess the state of the industry and available technologies, in order to define a new content billing architecture. Specifications and requirements for such a solution were researched and formulated, in order to complete the design and implementation. The choice for a cell phone Internet technology to support the new system fell on the Wireless Internet Gateway (WIG), as it caters to 99 % of the South African market by delivering text-based Internet content to 2 G cell phones. The content-based billing application (CBA) was developed and tested in the laboratory to verify its functionality and performance. It implements all the specifications and requirements. The CBA was then installed on the network of a South African cell phone operator. End-to- end performance tests on the complete system, including its latency and throughput levels, confirmed that it successfully implemented all requirements and business logic. Master...|$|E
