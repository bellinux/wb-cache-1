40|$|At a {{time when}} economies around the globe are {{experiencing}} <b>currency</b> crises, financial <b>turmoil,</b> or deep recessions, many of the world’s central banks are performing an experiment in monetary policy. The failures of monetarism in the 1970 s and 1980 s appear to have convinced most central bankers of the futility and riskiness of setting targets for the money supply. But even as unemployment rates rise {{in places such as}} Japan and Germany, and governments such as Argentina’s struggle to meet debt payments, central banks have not turned their attention to the goals of high growth and full employment. Instead, they focus on inflation targets, which they hope to reach by appointing independent specialists who set short-term interest rates. They have relegated fiscal policy and elected officials to the sidelines and assumed the mantle of economic policymaking. The new approach to monetary policy raises two issues.

40|$|The <b>currency</b> {{and market}} <b>turmoils</b> in East Asia since summer of 1997 {{are every bit}} as much {{political}} crises as they are economic ones. Indeed, the political manifestations of these events may linger long after the necessary economic reforms have been introduced to return at least a semblance of economic normalcy to the region. This paper assess some of the longer term political implications. It does so through 'Asian tinted lenses' rather than Anglo American ones and offers an alternative reading of the East Asian economic crisis to that which exists in the mainstream of western policy analysis. While accepting that particularist explanations apply on a country by country basis, the paper outlines: (i) those aspects of the crisis that appear common to those countries affected to-date: (ii) the importance of the silent but fundamental role of Japan as a factor in the crisis and (iii) notwithstanding the real/ material explanations of the crisis, it argues that the crisis is in large part an ideological one reflecting a western conceptual inability to deal with the Asian model of development's reluctance to converge to with an Anglo-American form of capitalism. While the policy remedies proffered by the IMF are accepted in Asia in the short run, they may well not be appreciated in the long run and a major implication of this interaction may well be an enhancement of the prospect of the continued development of an 'East Asian' as opposed to 'Asia Pacific' understanding of region. Some evidence of regional social learning from the crisis that may well consolidate the trend towards enhanced economic policy coordination that already exists.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the causes, cures {{and consequences of}} the Asian financial crisis. Since mid- 1997 a number of Southeast Asian economies {{have been in the}} grip of a severe financial crisis that has thrown the region into a deep recession. On the basis of expected diminishing returns this has raised doubts about the durability of the region's rapid growth rates which were realized since the 1980 's. Its very success made it attractive to private capital inflows which were borrowed in dollars on short terms but lent out domestically for long periods and intermediated through poorly regulated domestic financial systems. Large current account deficits due to overvalued currencies and overinvestment in the nontradable sector created an asset bubble which had to burst. The crisis started in Thailand in July 1997 but has not been predicted and alarm bells did not ring although the ratio of short-term debt to foreign reserves had increased to unsustainable heights and falling stock prices gave some indication of growing concern. A key feature of the crisis has been the contagion and spillover to other countries in the region. After six months of <b>currency</b> and stockmarket <b>turmoil</b> the process of cleaning up shattered financial systems did start, but some obstacles obstruct a rapid clean up. On the basis of IMF projections world output growth in 1998 has been estimated at 2 % (down from 4 % in 1997) and global growth is to recover only moderately in 1999. There are reasons to believe that the IMF rescue packages added rather than ameliorated the panic. Now financial and economic conditions in Asia are improving and the period of economic and financial meltdown is largely over. Real activity has reached a bottom and much of this reflects the improvement in current account balances. Incipient signs of recovery are emerging but the path to recovery remains rocky with significant head wind. While the symptoms of the crisis have abated and the underlying malaise is better understood, the treatment is only just beginning. ...|$|R

The causality test is also performed to determine the influence of each currency on each other. The results show that the currencies are non-stationary and at most there are four cointegrating vectors for the periods before and during the turmoil. The Granger causality test shows that Malaysian currency seems to have the most significant causalities on the ASEAN currencies during the turmoil.

This paper analyzes the links between banking and currency crises. We find that: problems in the banking sector typically precede a currency crisis [...] the currency crisis deepens the banking crisis, activating a vicious spiral; financial liberalization often precedes banking crises. The anatomy of these episodes suggests that crises occur as the economy enters a recession, following a prolonged boom in economic activity that was fueled by credit, capital inflows and accompanied by an overvalued currency. ...|$|E

Although Asian currencies eventually stabilized, it is still debated whether high interest rates contributed to the restoration of stability. Correlation and causality analyses using daily data show that the relationship among interest rates, exchange rates and external financial variables changed significantly when the crisis started. During the height of the crisis, currencies in the region exhibited high synchronization and mutual causation, which had not been visible in the pre-crisis period. Japanese and U. S. financial variables also influenced the movements of the Thai baht and the Korean won. By contrast, domestic interest rates suddenly lost their impact on exchange rates as the crisis worsened.

40|$|Twenty-five {{years after}} the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, Belarus stands out as a special case in transition blending, on the one hand, signs of relative prosperity, socially oriented policies and sprouts of entrepreneurships and, on the other hand, remnants of the communist past. The core of the Belarusian economic model throughout most of this period was a combination of external rents and soft budget constraints on the state-owned part of the economy backed by a strong system of administrative control. In periods of favourable external conditions this mix provided for relatively high rates of economic growth and allowed the authorities to maintain a ‘social contract’ with the population targeting close to full employment. But this model also led to the persistent accumulation of a quasi-fiscal deficit which time and again came to the surface, and its subsequent monetisation provoked macroeconomic and <b>currency</b> <b>turmoil.</b> At present, Belarus’ economic model has run up against its limits and policy changes seem inevitable...|$|E

Arrangements that had performed relatively well for years (think of Indonesia and Korea) {{came crashing down}} with almost no advance notice; other arrangements that once seemed invulnerable (think of Hong-Kong’s currency board), almost tumbled down as well. Mid-course corrections and policy changes proved equally troublesome: in every country that abandoned a peg and floated (Brazil, Russia, Ecuador, Thailand, again Indonesia and Korea), the exchange rate overshot massively and a period of <b>currency</b> <b>turmoil</b> followed. And all of it, of course, with tremendous real costs: both the high interest rates used to defend pegs and the massive depreciations that followed abandonment played havoc with corporate balance sheet and wrecked large chunks of the domestic financial system.

40|$|One of the {{prominent}} {{explanations for the}} East Asian financial crises of 1997 relies upon East Asian currency overvaluation. However, most empirical studies of these crises do not undertake serious examination of whether these currencies were overvalued. In this article, three major approaches to identifying the equilibrium exchange rate are implemented: long-run purchasing power parity (PPP), a productivity-based model, and a monetary model of the nominal exchange rate. The PPP calculations indicate that as of May 1997, the Hong Kong dollar, baht, ringgit, and peso were overvalued, and the won undervalued. In a framework that explicitly accounts {{for the role of}} productivity, substantial overvaluation of the peso is detected, but an undervaluation of the won is also uncovered. Misalignments of the ringgit and baht are small. Finally, the estimated equilibrium rates from a monetary model do not imply much deviation from short-run equilibrium at the end of June 1997. A conclusion of substantial overvaluation {{on the eve of the}} East Asian <b>currency</b> <b>turmoil</b> is not very plausible, suggesting that some alternate mechanism for generating crises - other than one involving the conventional macroeconomic fundamentals - was at work.

40|$|The {{economies of}} East Asian {{countries}} are being severely suppressed {{by the recent}} currency crisis. Since the <b>currency</b> <b>turmoil</b> in July 1997, East Asian countries have faced serious economic depression. Domestic demand shrunk and production levels dropped sharply in 1998. Many factories had to lay off their workers. This led to serious unemployment problems in the region. This paper discusses the influences of the economic crisis in East Asia {{and the need for}} job creation in this region. In such suppressed economies, an autonomous recovery cannot be expected immediately. Governments should prepare special policy to invite export-oriented FDI (foreign direct investment) for promoting export and transforming the structure of industry. Under the present situation FDI can play an important role for activating economic activities by increasing export and then relief the unemployment problem. In the long run, it is essential to deepen industrial linkages and to upgrade national technological and managerial capabilities. The importance of employees training at foreign affiliated companies in the host countries will also be emphasized.

In order to analyze when and how critique that aims at social change is rooted in anti-liberal ideology, we analyze the moral economy of the 2011 Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement and compare it to anti-financial protest in the late 19 th and early 20 th century in Germany and the UK. We argue that public statements by OWS groups and their supporters reproduce two major elements of 19 th century moral economy of financial protest: First, a description of finance as something external and hostile to the traditional socio-cultural community of production. Second, the image that financial interests are likely to capture political power. Beyond these continuities, we argue that today the dichotomy between "cosmopolitan finance" and the "productive national community" is much less clearly connected to sectoral, socio-economic, or ethnic cleavages. Instead, financial outsiders are perceived as having removed themselves voluntarily from the community in order to gain profits. Still, we conclude that because of the semantic similarities between past and recent anti-finance protest, right-wing populism in Europe may not necessarily be weakened by popular anti-austerity protests...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} financial system is failing us. At times, financial markets disappear, financial contagion sweeps away exchange rate arrangements that are fundamentally supported, and currency crises have real, worldwide economic impact. Disturbingly, these episodes appear {{more frequent and}} more ferocious than before. The solution is not to curtail portfolio flows, which {{have the potential to}} deliver scarce investment to developing countries, or for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to do more of the same, just more quickly and with more money. We must try to work with the financial markets and not against them. Countries that meet simple, transparent criteria should be eligible to draw support from a superfund of pooled foreign exchange reserves whenever they choose. Currency crashes should be selectively avoided, not ameliorated afterwards. Countries that do not meet the criteria should be offered technical assistance and development support, but not bailouts. The moral hazard associated with bailouts is already acting as an obstacle to reform in a number of economies.

40|$|The {{stability}} of international financial markets {{is an important}} issue for academics and policymakers. Crises in currency markets have become increasingly common with the 1990 s in particular experiencing major episodes of <b>currency</b> <b>turmoil.</b> The causation and frequency of these crises is a puzzle, especially for semi-free-floating currencies. In this thesis recent currency crises are introduced and examined. Theories and methodologies which evolved in complexity and network sciences are then shown to have analogies to currency crises and to offer insights for finance. Common factors of recent currency crises are shown to be explainable using complexity and network sciences, and that price determinant influences exhibit characteristics of a complex network. An alternative approach to currency crises based on binary choices using an agent-based model in an explicit topological sparsely clustered network is proposed. This is shown to be capable of generating complex dynamics, including cascades. A proxy topology of currency influences is then extracted from the international foreign exchange price matrix and shown to exhibit a robust taxonomy. This topology is then subjected to cascade simulation analysis. The results show that node threshold values and the density of external links are the key parameters in terms of cascade propagation. It is thus shown that a simple parsimonious model of trader interaction within a foreign exchange network can produce dynamics which are complex and contingent, and match the proposed stylised facts of currency crises. Policy issues flowing from these findings are discussed. The results increase our understanding of price dynamics in financial markets...|$|E

In this paper, we show that capital controls negatively affect growth in authoritarian countries, while growth in democratic countries is insignif-icantly affected.

Our findings suggest that policy makers should take careful account of the political context when considering the decision to impose capital controls. Do controls on cross border capital flows depress economic growth? Recent events sug-gest that {{the answer to this question}} is not straightforward. Countries with extensive capital controls have displayed a wide range of growth rates, the difference between the economic performances of China and most African nations being a case in point.

40|$|For {{the first}} time, {{non-parametric}} statistical tests, originally developed by Sherry (1992) {{to test the}} efficiency of information processing in nervous systems, are used to ascertain if the Asian FX rates followed random walks. The stationarity and serial independence of the price changes are tested on minute-by-minute data for nine currencies for the period from January 1, 1997 to December 30, 1997. Tested were the Thai baht, Indonesian rupiah, Malaysian ringgit, Philippines' peso, Singapore dollar, Taiwan dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, with the Japanese Yen and German Deutschmark as benchmarks (The U. S. Dollar is the base currency). The efficiency of these FX markets {{before and after the}} onset of the Asian <b>currency</b> <b>turmoil</b> (i. e., January 1 - June 30, 1997 and July 1 - December 30, 1997) are compared. The Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit, Indonesian rupiah and Singapore dollar exhibited non-stationary behavior during the entire year, and gave evidence of a trading regime break, while the Phillipines' peso, Taiwan dollar, Yen and Deutschmark remained stationary (The Hong Kong dollar was pegged). However, each half-year regime showed stationarity by itself, indicating stable and nonchaotic trading regimes for all currencies, despite the high volatilities, except the Malaysian ringgit, which exhibited non-stationarity {{in the second half of}} 1997. The Thai baht traded nonstationarily in the first half of 1997, but stationarily in the second half, while the Taiwan dollar reversed that trading pattern. Regarding Sherry's four serial independence tests of differential spectrum, relative price changes, temporal trading windows of at least 20 minutes long and price change category transitions: none of the currencies exhibited complete independence. Thus no Asian currency market - including the Yen - exhibited complete efficiency in 1997 regarding both stationarity and independence, in particular when compared with the highly efficient Deutschmark. But, remarkably, the Phillippines' peso remained as efficient as the Japanese Yen throughout 1997. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{world is}} once again under threat of <b>currency</b> <b>turmoil</b> ignited by a {{vigorous}} appreciation of the dollar against all other currencies. This is the harbinger of another long cycle {{which has been the}} pattern of exchange rates since the fall of the Bretton Woods system in 1971. Because dollar cycles are driven by momentum dynamics disconnected from fundamentals, they are likely to distort real effective exchange rates between major currencies. The dollar appreciation phase may also wreak havoc in the financial systems of emerging countries that are heavily indebted in dollars. In the present state of the world economy, the prospect of a new dollar cycle is particularly worrisome since most countries, far from deleveraging after the financial crisis, have massively increased their debt relative to GDP in the non-financial sectors. The rise in dollar debt is due to subpar income growth in the world economy which has precluded deleveraging of the already high level of debt reached in 2007 on the one hand, and to the status of the dollar as the de facto exclusive supplier of international liquidity on the other hand. Because US monetary policy is not bound by any international rules, it has supplied liquidity on its own terms, flooding the world with cheap money in order to revive domestic consumption in the US. The catalyst for renewed dollar appreciation has been the divergence in monetary policy between the US on the one side, Japan until early 2013, and the euro area until late 2014 on the other. Monetary policies in these latter countries, working counter to the US before a recent change in course, have created deflation risks that the new trend of dollar appreciation compounded with the slump in the price of oil is expected to correct, spreading the recovery worldwide...|$|E
40|$|Economic and {{monetary}} union has a particularly far-reaching impact on farmers and agricultural policy in general. The farming sector has traditionally played a {{lead role in}} integration. Nevertheless, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) soon reached its limits in the current European monetary system. Common farm prices, subsidies, etc. are almost impossible to implement without a common currency. The CAP has been regularly upset by <b>currency</b> <b>turmoil</b> and rocked by frequent crisis situations. The agricultural monetary regime developed as a make-shift solution is flawed and unable to forestall disadvantages for farmers in hard-currency countries. In the present system, the appreciation of a national currency translates into price and income pressures for farmers and (at least temporary) competitive disadvantages for their commercial standing. Benefits and disadvantages of EMU The single currency will provide the CAP with the stable foundation that it {{has so far been}} lacking. It eliminates the current practice of translating farm prices, subsidies, etc. from their fixed ECU rates to national currencies, which in turn means that the agricultural monetary regime will become superfluous. Exchange rate fluctuations and exchange rate-caused distortions will no longer occur, so that EMU will, {{for the first time since}} the CAP was introduced, secure a common agricultural market that offers fair competitive terms to all participants. This is a crucial advantage and probably the greatest gain for farmers in the hard-currency countries such as Austria. The change to the euro nevertheless will entail both problems and costs for farmers. Position of Austrian farmers For Austrian farmers, the benefits of the single currency will prevail: their currently disadvantaged position in a hard-currency country will disappear and they will be able to compete at fair terms. The Austrian agricultural sector would prefer the first wave of EMU members to be large, to ensure that its benefits will be maximized. The participation of Italy in the single currency is especially important, as it is Austria's second largest market for farm products. A "small EMU" would not be desirable for the farming and food industry. The schilling-euro conversion rate will play a key role in the transition to EMU for the agricultural sector, as it affects the purchasing power of farm prices and producer subsidies fixed in euro, which in turn bears upon agricultural incomes. Should the schilling be appreciated vis-à-vis the currently valid "green rates", this would have a negative impact on farmers' incomes.
