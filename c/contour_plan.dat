This dissertation will concentrate on mapping of the greens at Toowoomba City Golf Course to create a <b>contour</b> <b>plan</b> {{for each of the}} greens. This will update existing map information and add additional information to what is currently available through the Golf Club. A combination of GPS, robotic total station and digital scanner were used to collect positional information on the greens. An accuracy assessment was performed on the information collected to determine the most accurate method of data collection to provide a contoured surface that represents the true contours of the actual surface. A number of maps were created using AutoCAD, Terramodel and Trimble Geomatics Office software packages. A wall mounted map of greens has been produced, to replace the existing map, showing location of greens and adjacent features. This map is designed to show golfers the location of the hole on each green for the day’s play. The map hangs at the Golf Club beside the Pro Shop and is updated by greenkeepers as pin placements change. Individual green contour plans were also produced for the Golf Club to use in their marketing strategies when attracting new members and competitions.

40|$|Objective: Manual {{contouring}} {{and registration}} for radiotherapy treatment planning and online adaptation for cervical cancer radiation therapy in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance images (MRI) are often necessary. However manual intervention is time consuming and may suffer from inter or intra-rater variability.

40|$|Abstract PURPOSE: Condylar {{reconstruction}} and replacement using alloplastic materials currently attracts much surgical interest. The major {{challenge is to}} functionally reconstruct the anatomical region; this is crucial in terms of correct mandibular function. The goal {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of and complications experienced by a series of oncological patients who underwent computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) condylar reconstruction following resection-disarticulation of the mandible. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included nine patients who underwent disarticulation resection surgery to treat benign and malignant mandibular tumors involving the condylar region. All resections preserved the articular meniscus and featured placement of a CAD/CAM reconstructive plate supporting a fibular, microvascular free flap. The head of the prosthetic condyle reproduced the anatomical morphology of the native condyle. Patients were clinically evaluated in terms of occlusion stability, mandibular functional recovery, static and dynamic pain, and preservation of the normal mandibular <b>contour.</b> <b>Planning</b> and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were superimposed to assess the accuracy of reconstruction. RESULTS: No patient experienced plate exposure and, on direct clinical examination, no patient complained of joint pain. No patient developed plate loosening. No resorption of the glenoid fossa was evident when pre- and postoperative bone thicknesses were compared by CT. Preoperative occlusion was preserved in all dentate patients. One patient exhibited condylar displacement. In terms of reconstructive accuracy, the average postoperative deviation of the condyle from the preoperative position was 3. 8 mm (range: 1. 3 - 6. 7 mm). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical outcomes of our series of oncological patients who underwent reconstruction using CAD/CAM plates including condyles were encouraging.

40|$|Improvements in {{computing}} {{speed and}} capacity {{and the increasing}} collection and digitisation of geological data now allow geoscientists to produce meaningful 3 D spatial models of the shallow subsurface in many large urban areas, to predict ground conditions and reduce risk and uncertainty in urban planning. It {{is not yet clear}} how useful this 3 D modelling approach is at smaller urban scales, where poorly characterised anthropogenic deposits (artificial/made ground and fill) form the dominant subsurface material and where the availability of borehole and other geological data is less comprehensive. This is important as it is these smaller urban sites, with complex site history, which frequently form the focus of urban regeneration and redevelopment schemes. This paper examines {{the extent to which the}} 3 D modelling approach previously utilised at large urban scales can be extended to smaller less well-characterised urban sites, using a historic landfill site in Sheepcote Valley, Brighton, UK as a case study. Two 3 D models were generated and compared using GSI 3 D™ software, one using borehole data only, one combining borehole data with local geological maps and results from a desk study (involving collation of available site data, including ground <b>contour</b> <b>plans).</b> These models clearly delimit the overall subsurface geology at the site, and allow visualisation and modelling of the anthropogenic deposits present. Shallow geophysical data collected from the site partially validate the 3 D modelled data, and can improve GSI 3 D™ outputs where boundaries of anthropogenic deposits may not be clearly defined by surface, contour or borehole data. Attribution of geotechnical and geochemical properties to the 3 D model is problematic without intrusive investigations and sampling. However, combining available borehole data, shallow geophysical methods and site histories may allow attribution of generic fill properties, and consequent reduction of urban development risk and uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{two main}} {{modalities}} to deliver high dose to the prostate and prevent high doses to neighboring organs are intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or {{external beam radiotherapy}} combined with brachytherapy. Because of the different biological effectiveness the physical dose distributions were converted to 3 -dimensional linear quadratic dose at 2 Gy per fraction (EQD(2)). From the latter, cumulative EQD(2) -volume histograms were determined for comparison of the modalities. Material and methods: An IMRT plan was made on the <b>contoured</b> <b>planning</b> target volume (PTV 1) and organs at risk (OAR) of 20 patients (IMRT-only). A dose of 70 Gy was prescribed on the PTV 1 with a concomitant boost {{to a total of}} 76 Gy on a subvolume (PTV 2). Also a 46 Gy IMRT plan was made combined with either a pulsed dose-rate (PDR) or a high dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost. The EQD(2) on the PTV 1 of the combined IMRT-PDR and IMRT-HDR plans were made equivalent to the EQD(2) of the 70 Gy IMRT-only plan. The alpha/beta-ratio for prostate was set to 1. 5 Gy and 10 Gy. For normal tissues an alpha/beta-ratio of 3. 0 Gy was taken. Several EQD(2) -volume histogram parameters were calculated for comparison and analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Results: The mean EQD(2) to 95 % of the prostate volume was slightly higher for the IMRT-only plan than for the brachytherapy modalities (P < 0. 001), in contrast to the mean EQD(2) to 50 % of the prostate volume in which the opposite was the case (P < 0. 001). Rectum and bladder doses for IMRT-only are significantly higher (P < 0. 001). The urethra dose for IMRT-HDR was much higher than the other modalities only when the alpha/beta-ratio for prostate was 10 Gy. Conclusion: Because of the high doses within an implant, the dose in 50 % of the prostate volume is much higher with the brachytherapy modalities than IMRT-only which may have clinical consequences. With brachytherapy the doses to the OAR are lower or similar to IMRT-only. Dose escalation for prostate tumors is more easily achieved with brachytherapy than with IMRT alone. Therefore, brachytherapy might be the preferred modality to achieve further dose escalation. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} topological hierarchy-based {{approach}} to toolpath planning for multi-material layered manufacturing (MMLM) of heterogeneous prototypes. The approach facilitates control of MMLM {{and increases the}} fabrication efficiency of complex objects by generating multi-toolpaths that avoid redundant tool movements and potential collisions. It uses a topological hierarchy-sorting algorithm to group complex multi-material slice contours into families connected by a parent-and-child relationship. Subsequently, a sequential toolpath planning algorithm generates multi-toolpaths for sequential deposition of materials without redundant tool movements. To reduce build time further, a concurrent toolpath planning algorithm generates collision-free multi-toolpaths to control the tools that deposit materials concurrently. It uses parametric polygons to construct tool envelopes for contour families of the same material property to simplify detection of tool collisions. The tightness of polygons can be controlled to suit the processing speed and the optimality of the resulting concurrent toolpaths. The proposed approach has been implemented {{as an integral part}} of a multi-material virtual prototyping (MMVP) system that can process complex slice <b>contours</b> for <b>planning,</b> stereoscopic simulation, and validation of multi-toolpaths. It may be adapted for subsequent control of MMLM processes. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

He added 50 terraced apartments and a shopping center {{at the base of}} the buildings to accommodate the topographical <b>contours.</b> The revised <b>plan</b> raised another round of opposition when it was presented to the Jerusalem district planning committee. Kadish Luz, Speaker of the Knesset, claimed that [...] "from the height of the towers, it would be possible to snipe at the Knesset, and even to bomb it". Ish-Shalom persuaded Luz to retract his opposition, and hinted to the committee that a few small apartments could be set aside for committee members if they would approve the five towers, which they did.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Target volume {{definitions}} for radiotherapy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) vary substantially. Some groups aim {{to treat}} the primary tumor only, whereas others include elective lymph nodes (eLNs). eLNs close to the primary tumor are often included unintentionally within the treatment volume, depending on the respective treatment philosophies. We aimed to measure the percentages of anatomical coverage of eLNs by comparing four different contouring guidelines. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Planning target volumes (PTVs) were <b>contoured</b> using <b>planning</b> computed tomography (CT) scans of 11  patients with PDAC based on the Oxford, RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), Michigan, and SCALOP (Selective Chemoradiation in Advanced Localised Pancreatic Cancer trial) guidelines. Clinical target volumes (CTVs) included the peripancreatic, para-aortic, paracaval, celiac trunk, superior mesenteric, and portal vein lymph node areas. Volumetric comparisons of the coverage of all eLN regions were conducted to illustrate {{the differences between the}} four contouring strategies. RESULTS: The PTV sizes of the RTOG and Oxford guidelines were comparable. The SCALOP and Michigan PTV sizes were similar to each other and significantly smaller than the RTOG and Oxford PTVs. A large variability of eLN coverage was found for the various subregions according to the respective contouring strategies. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to directly compare the percentage of anatomical coverage of eLNs according to four PTVs in the same patient cohort. Potential practical consequences are discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the use of modern {{solid-state}} lasers has brought about a distinct increase in operational speed in laser materials processing. Whether with scanners or fixed optics, high speeds - {{as far as possible}} in various axes at the same time - have almost become the norm. But although the movement of the optic is precisely calculated, the position of the processing point can deviate from the <b>planned</b> <b>contour.</b> Help is at hand, thanks to a process monitoring system developed by Fraunhofer ILT which precisely tracks the relative movement of work piece and optic. It enables acceleration related deviations from the set contour and speed to be measured exactly and the numerical control system to be adjusted accordingly. The kinematics measurement can be adapted to most laser processes (e. g. welding, brazing, cutting, selective laser melting, etc.) as an optional metrology method...|$|R
50|$|The archaeological excavationsconducted in two seasons; 2002 and 2004at the Korisha {{fortress}} {{located at}} the areaknown by the toponomy as the 'Gralishta'hill, revealed <b>contours</b> and documentedthe <b>plan</b> of an earlyChristian church of the6th century AD. TheKorisha early Christianchurch which is locatedinside the fortress has anapse oriented toward theeast. Inside the church,traces of a cintron areconstructed in the formof stairs and in the shapeof trapeze. Within thealtar area of the churchparts of the banisterswere documented. Themovable archaeologicalmaterial, abundant anddiverse findings were recorded here, which,besides the Late Antique date, the fragmentsof pottery of the Middle Bronze Agewere evidenced also, which most probablyare related with the Bronze Age site situatedonly few hundred meters northeast fromthe fortress. Nonetheless, many amphora's,pithos, jars, jugs, etc. were discovered, ofthe Late Antique date, which confirms occupancyof the fortress and the church duringthe 4th-6th century AD.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Produce a {{collection}} of software tools (computer programs) that support three-dimensional (3 D) radiation therapy planning. The tools are not a complete 3 D planning sytem. Instead, they work with any 3 D planning system that meets certain minimal specifications. The tools assist in deriving anatomic data from images, generating target volume <b>contours,</b> evaluating treatment <b>plans</b> and verifying accurate treatment delivery. The tools are portable: they can run without source code changes in any computing environment that provides a library of functions and data definitions called the Foundation. The Foundation couples the portable tools to the (usually non-portable) file system and dose calculation associated with a particular 3 D planning system. Methods and Materials: Tools were written at three different (geographically separated) institutions. Software developers from all three sites specified the Foundation. The programmers' interface to the Foundation is portable, but a Founda [...] ...|$|R
