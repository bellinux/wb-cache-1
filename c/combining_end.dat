40|$|AbstractLong-term in situ incubations were {{performed}} to verify {{the likelihood of the}} heterogeneity concept of the potentially digestible fraction of the insoluble fiber (NDFom) by fitting both heterogeneous and homogeneous potentially digestible NDFom versions of a generalized compartmental model of digestion (GCMD). Corn silage and eleven tropical grasses and alfalfa hay were studied. Data were gathered from a study in which forage samples in nylon bags were incubated in rumen cannulated steers so that three profiles per forage were generated. The incubation endpoint was used to form sets of time profiles. The original set consisted of profiles ending at 1440 h, and the other two were formed by using 96 and 240 h as the incubation endpoints, respectively. The indigestible residue was estimated using nonlinear least squares or by assuming it to be 2. 4 times lignin determined by the sulphuric acid method (Lignin (sa)). Therefore, eight different models were evaluated by <b>combining</b> <b>end</b> points of digestion, and the homogeneous and heterogeneous versions of GCMD with the two ways of estimating the indigestible residue. The likelihood of the models was assessed by computing Akaike information criteria. The effects of forage, model, and their interaction were analyzed by taking model as a repeated measurement. Heterogeneity of the potentially degradable fraction for NDFom was detected with long-term incubation trials (up to 1440 h) for some forages, and the introduction of the 2. 4 ×Lignin (sa) as a direct measure of the indigestible residue improved the likelihood of the heterogeneous version of GCMD. The forage by model interaction was significant for many comparable parameter estimates, which means that specific and inconsistent results for models within forages were produced depending on the definition of the incubation end-point. The indigestible residue was overestimated with short-term incubation profiles, but the overestimation was lower for the profiles ending at 240 h whether compared to profiles ending at 96 h. Given the likelihood of the heterogeneous version of GCMD fitted to profiles ending at 1440 h and at 240 h for some forages, the heterogeneity concept should be investigated whenever the research interest relies on estimating the kinetic attributes of the degradation profiles of the NDFom in situ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patients with {{metabolic}} syndrome have {{increased risk of}} cardiovascular events. The number of patients with {{metabolic syndrome}} is rapidly increasing, and these patients often need revascularization. However, only limited data {{are available on the}} effect of metabolic syndrome on restenosis in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To assess the role of metabolic syndrome in the development of restenosis, we performed an analysis in a population of patients from the GENetic DEterminants of Restenosis (GENDER) study. The GENDER project, a multicenter prospective study, included consecutive patients after successful PCI and was designed to study the predictive value of various genetic and other risk factors for subsequent clinical restenosis, defined as target vessel revascularization (TVR) or <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point of death, myocardial infarction, and TVR. This subpopulation of GENDER consisted of 901 patients, 448 of whom (49. 7 %) had metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: On multivariable Cox regression analysis, controlling for age, sex, previous myocardial infarction, stent length, current smoking, and statin therapy, there was no association between increased risk of TVR (hazard ratio 1. 03 [95 % CI 0. 68 - 1. 57]) or the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point (1. 05 [0. 71 - 1. 55]) and the presence of metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that metabolic syndrome is not associated with TVR or the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point after PCI. Furthermore, accumulating characteristics of metabolic syndrome were neither associated with increased risk of TVR nor with the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point. Therefore, PCI has equal beneficial results in patients with or without metabolic syndrome.

SETTING: One general practice in each of 24 British towns. SUBJECTS: 7735 men aged 40 - 59 years at screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All cause death rate, heart attacks, and stroke (fatal and non-fatal) and development of diabetes, or any of these outcomes (<b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point) over an average follow up of 14. 8 years. RESULTS: There were 1271 deaths from all causes, 974 heart attacks, 290 strokes, and 245 new cases of diabetes mellitus. All cause mortality was increased only in men with a body mass index (kg/m 2) or = 30. However, risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack, and diabetes increased progressively from an index of < 20 even after age, smoking, social class, alcohol consumption, and physical activity were adjusted for. For the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point the lowest risks were seen for an index of 20. 0 - 23. 9.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{predictive}} potency of impaired endothelium-dependent flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). BackgroundChronic heart failure is associated with reduced FMD; the prognostic impact of this observation is unknown. MethodsSeventy-five ambulatory CHF patients (United Network of Organ Sharing [UNOS] status 2) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 30 %, despite optimized medical therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, 100 %; beta-blocker, 81 %), were evaluated. Using high-resolution ultrasound, FMD of the brachial artery was assessed in addition to other neurohormonal, clinical, and hemodynamic variables. Age, gender, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, LVEF, hemodynamic variables, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, medical therapy, cardiovascular risk factors, and FMD were analyzed for prediction of the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point conversion to UNOS status 1 or death in a multivariate Cox model. ResultsUp to three years, 21 patients (28 %) converted to UNOS status 1, and 6 patients (8 %) died. Univariate risk factors for the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point were log BNP (p = 0. 0032), FMD (p = 0. 0033), NYHA functional class (p = 0. 0132), beta-blocker therapy (p = 0. 0367), and mean blood pressure (p = 0. 0406).

40|$|Objective: In {{patients}} with multivessel {{coronary artery disease}} and total occlusion of major epicardial vessel, completeness of revascularization has not been investigated in specific trials comparing the surgical and the percutaneous revascularization strategy. Analyzing the database of the CABRI study, which randomized {{a substantial number of}} these patients, we investigated the long-term effects of a successful or unsuccessful revascularization of the occluded vessel and completeness of the revascularization. Methods and results: The CABRI study randomized 1054 {{patients with}} multivessel coronary disease to coronary bypass or to coronary angioplasty. From the database of this trial, we selected patients with a major vessel chronically occluded (103 in the bypass group and 120 in the angioplasty group). At a median follow-up of 30 months, the incidence of death or Q-wave myocardial infarction (<b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point) was significantly lower in the bypass group than in the angioplasty group (6. 8 % vs 17. 5 %, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0. 42 [95 % CI 0. 17 - 0. 98]; p = 0. 047). On univariate analysis, age, proximal occlusion, complete revascularization, revascularization of the occluded vessel and revascularization procedure were identified as significant predictors of <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> points. On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> points resulted in completeness of revascularization (HR 0. 26; 95 % CI 0. 09 - 0. 76; p = 0. 01) and age (HR 1. 07; 95 % CI 1. 02 - 1. 12; p < 0. 01). Conclusion: In patients with multivessel coronary disease and chronic occlusion of a major epicardial vessel, achieving of a complete revascularization by reopening or bypassing the occluded vessel is associated with a significantly better tong-term prognosis.

40|$|ObjectiveThe aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the long-term outcome of patients exclusively undergoing total arterial revascularization off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and to compare {{the performance of the}} radial artery and the right internal thoracic artery as a second conduit. MethodsWe studied a consecutive series of 1700 patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, receiving a radial artery or right internal thoracic artery as a second graft for total arterial revascularization, between 2003 and 2010. A total of 1447 patients (85. 11 %) received bilateral internal thoracic artery grafting, and 253 patients (14. 89 %) received left internal thoracic artery and radial artery grafting. A propensity score–matched analysis was performed to compare the 2 groups, bilateral internal thoracic artery and left internal thoracic artery and radial artery, relative to overall survival, morbidity, and <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> points event–free survival. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by Cox regression. ResultsIn the full unmatched patient population, the postoperative survival (HR, 0. 59; 95 % CI, 0. 38 - 0. 92; P = . 021), incidence of reintervention/readmission (HR, 0. 42; 95 % CI, 0. 28 - 0. 61; P < . 001), and <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> points (HR, 0. 47; 95 % CI, 0. 35 - 0. 63; P < . 001) were significantly better in the bilateral internal thoracic artery group.

Methods and Results: Renal function was estimated with glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Patients from the Metoprolol CR/XL Controlled Randomized Intervention Trial in Chronic HF (MERIT-HF) were divided into 3 renal function subgroups (MDRD formula) : eGFR(MDRD) > 60 (n = 2496), eGFR(MDRD) 45 to 60 (n = 976), and eGFR(MDRD) 60 : HR for all-cause mortality, 1. 90 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 28 to 2. 81) comparing placebo patients with eGFR 60, and for the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point of all-cause mortality/hospitalization for worsening HF (time to first event) : HR, 1. 91 (95 % CI, 1. 44 to 2. 53).

40|$|Abstract—We {{recently}} developed a novel method for assessment of arterial wave reflections (ARCSolver method) : based on adopted Windkessel methods, flow curves are estimated from pressure waveforms, and wave separation analysis is performed, yielding the amplitudes of the {{forward and backward}} waves. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate their clinical correlates and prognostic impact. In 725 patients (417 men; mean age, 64 years) undergoing coronary angiography, we determined wave reflections from radial tonometry and transfer function-derived aortic waveforms using pulse wave analysis, as well as wave separation analysis. Measures of pulsatile arterial function were statistically significant, although moderately associated with markers of cardiac load and subclinic cardiac, renal, and aortic end-organ damage. After a median follow-up duration of 1399 days, 139 patients reached the <b>combined</b> cardiovascular <b>end</b> point (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral revascularization). In univariate analysis, the relative risk of the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point increased with increasing levels of incident pressure wave height, augmented pressure, and forward and backward wave amplitude (hazard ratio for 1 SD was 1. 302, 1. 236, 1. 226, and 1. 276; P 0. 01 for all, respectively). In multivariate analysis, backward wave amplitude was the most consistent predictor of the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point. Of note, its predictive value was independent of brachial systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures and was superior to brachial pulse pressure. In conclusion, the amplitude of the reflected wave, as assessed with a novel method for wave separation, is associated with hypertensive end organ damage and is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients.

Here we tested whether anti-tumor natural killer (NK) cell and allo-responsive T-cell function in kidney transplant recipients may predict cancer risk and define risk of rejection. NK cell function was measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase and T-cell allo-response by interferon-γ quantification using a panel of reactive T-cell enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) in 56 kidney transplant recipients with current or past cancer and 26 kidney transplant recipients without cancer. NK function was significantly impaired and the allo-response was significantly lower in kidney transplant recipients with cancer. With prospective follow-up, kidney transplant recipients with poor NK cell function had a hazard ratio of 2. 1 (95 % confidence interval 0. 97 - 5. 00) for the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point of metastatic cancer, cancer-related death, or septic death.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess risk of {{inpatient}} surgery at any time after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES). BackgroundRisk of adverse events, including stent thrombosis (ST), in patients undergoing surgical procedures with prior DES remains poorly defined. MethodsOutcomes of consecutive patients having inpatient surgical procedures after PCI with DES, placed from April 28, 2003 until December 31, 2006 at a tertiary-care medical center, were studied. Primary and secondary end points were 30 -day post-operative risk of the Academic Research Consortium (ARC) definite and modified probable definitions of ST and combined 30 -day post-operative risk of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or ST, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine independent risk factors. ResultsSix hundred six inpatient surgeries on 481 patients with a mean time from PCI to surgery of 1. 07 ± 0. 89 years were evaluated. The primary and secondary end points occurred after 11 (2. 0 %) and 56 (9 %) surgeries, respectively. Risk of the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point and ST decreased significantly in the first 1 to 6 months after PCI (p 12 months. Independent correlates of the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point include emergency surgery, antecedent MI, the pre-operative use of intravenous heparin, and atherosclerotic lesion length treated with DES.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether QRS duration or morphology increased the risk of adverse outcome in the DAVID (Dual Chamber and VVI Implantable Defibrillator) trial. BackgroundThe DAVID trial found an increased risk of the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point of death and new or worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) in defibrillator recipients who were paced DDDR- 70 versus VVI- 40. MethodsWe analyzed the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point in patients with abnormal QRS duration (AbQRS) (≥ 110 ms) compared with those with normal QRS duration (NQRS) (< 110 ms). ResultsThe QRS data were available for 496 of the 506 patients enrolled in the trial, including 223 patients with NQRS (45 %) and 273 patients with AbQRS (55 %). In patients in whom defibrillators were programmed to pace infrequently (VVI- 40), having an NQRS or AbQRS was not an indicator of increased risk of adverse outcome. However, among patients in whom defibrillators were programmed in a manner that promoted more frequent ventricular pacing (DDDR- 70), there was a significant adverse interaction with AbQRS; this combination was independently associated with a higher risk for developing CHF or death (p = 0. 017). ConclusionsAlthough patients with AbQRS tended to have other risk factors associated with poor outcome, the interaction of QRS duration with ventricular pacing (DDDR- 70) independently contributed to a worse outcome and therefore, was a marker of patients in whom such treatment may be harmful. This should not imply that right ventricular pacing in NQRS patients is safe but rather that pacing in the context of an AbQRS is probably best avoided...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{studied the}} {{prognostic}} implications of midwall fibrosis in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in a prospective longitudinal study. BackgroundRisk stratification {{of patients with}} nonischemic DCM {{in the era of}} device implantation is problematic. Approximately 30 % of patients with DCM have midwall fibrosis as detected by late gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), which may increase susceptibility to arrhythmia and progression of heart failure. MethodsConsecutive DCM patients (n = 101) with {{the presence or absence of}} midwall fibrosis were followed up prospectively for 658 ± 355 days for events. ResultsMidwall fibrosis was present in 35 % of patients and was associated with a higher rate of the predefined primary <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point of all-cause death and hospitalization for a cardiovascular event (hazard ratio 3. 4, p = 0. 01). Multivariate analysis showed midwall fibrosis as the sole significant predictor of death or hospitalization. However, there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between the 2 groups. Midwall fibrosis also predicted secondary outcome measures of sudden cardiac death (SCD) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) (hazard ratio 5. 2, p = 0. 03). Midwall fibrosis remained predictive of SCD/VT after correction for baseline differences in left ventricular ejection fraction between the 2 groups. ConclusionsIn DCM, midwall fibrosis determined by CMR is a predictor of the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization, which is independent of ventricular remodeling. In addition, midwall fibrosis by CMR predicts SCD/VT. This suggests a potential role for CMR in the risk stratification of patients with DCM, which may have value in determining the need for device therapy...|$|R

To determine {{if there are any}} differences in later outcomes, we compared midterm results of propensity-matched patients who underwent off- and on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. MethodsFrom January 1997 to July 2000, 481 patients underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and 3231 underwent on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Propensity matching was used to match 406 patients from each group. Previously, the propensity-matched off-pump patients were found to have had significantly fewer bypass grafts. These 812 patients were followed for time-related events, including death, myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary reoperation, and the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and all coronary reintervention. Follow-up was 95 % complete. ResultsAt 4 years, survival was 87. 5 % after off-pump and 91. 2 % after on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (P =. 2); freedom from myocardial infarction was 92. 6 % and 95. 7 % (P =. 7), respectively; freedom from percutaneous coronary intervention was 94. 3 % and 95. 5 % (P =. 9), respectively; freedom from coronary reoperation was 98. 1 % and 99. 0 % (P =. 4), respectively; and freedom from the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and coronary reintervention was 75. 2 % and 82. 9 % (P =. 14), respectively.

Baseline clinical and angiographic data were comparable in both groups. At 6 months, MLD in the IVUS group (1. 82 +/- 0. 53 mm) was larger than in the angiography group (1. 51 +/- 0. 71 mm; P= 0. 042). TLR and combined end-point rates at 6 months were 4 % (n= 3) and 6 % (n= 4) in the IVUS group and 14 % (n= 10) and 20 % (n= 14) in the angiography group, respectively (P= 0. 037 for TLR and P= 0. 01 for combined events).

40|$|BACKGROUND; AIMS: The role of oral supplementation with {{branched-chain}} {{amino acids}} (BCAA) in advanced cirrhosis {{is far from}} settled. A nutritional approach might prevent progressive liver failure and improve nutritional parameters and quality of life. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized study comparing 1 -year nutritional supplementation with BCAA against lactoalbumin or maltodextrins was performed in 174 patients with advanced cirrhosis. Primary outcomes were the prevention of a <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point (death and deterioration to exclusion criteria), the need for hospital admission, and the duration of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes were nutritional parameters, laboratory data and Child-Pugh score, anorexia, health-related quality of life, and need for therapy. RESULTS: Treatment with BCAA significantly reduced the combined event rates compared with lactoalbumin (odds ratio, 0. 43; 95...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the temporal trends in outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention in lesions with angiographically visible thrombus and {{to assess the impact}} of drug-eluting stents (DES) on long-term outcomes. BackgroundPercutaneous coronary intervention in the presence of angiographically visible thrombus is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Whether recent advances in devices and adjunctive pharmacotherapy have made any significant impact on clinical outcomes is unknown. Moreover, concerns have been raised about the safety of DES in thrombotic lesions. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 6, 227 consecutive patients who had angiographically visible thrombus. Patients were grouped into 3 eras depending on the dominant interventional strategy of that time: early stent era (1990 to 1996), bare-metal stent era (1997 to 2003), and DES era (2003 to 2006). ResultsProcedural success rates, although much improved, have remained unchanged in the last 2 cohorts (43 %, 85 %, 86 %; p < 0. 001). Adjusted in-hospital mortality (4. 7 %, 3. 0 %, 3. 6 %; p < 0. 001), and major adverse cardiovascular events (7. 8 %, 5. 0 %, 5. 3 %; p < 0. 001) decreased modestly. During long-term follow-up, mortality and the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point of death or myocardial infarction were similar in the 3 cohorts; but the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point of death, myocardial infarction, or target lesion revascularization (p < 0. 001) was lower in the 2 most recent eras. ConclusionsThere has been a marked improvement in procedural success accompanied by a reduction in in-hospital mortality and major adverse cardiac event rates. Importantly, the introduction of DES has not been associated with a greater risk of death or myocardial infarction among patients with angiographically visible thrombus...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThis {{study was}} done to assess and compare the {{prognostic}} significance of multiple methods for measuringST-segment elevation resolution (STR) following primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BackgroundResolution of ST-segment elevation (STE) is a powerful predictor of both infarct-related artery patency and mortality in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Recent thrombolytic {{studies have suggested that}} simple measures of STR may be as powerful as more complex algorithms. The optimal method of assessing STR following primary PCI has not been studied. MethodsWe analyzed 700 patients with technically adequate baseline and post-PCI electrocardiograms from the Controlled Abciximab and Device Investigation to Lower Late Angioplasty Complications (CADILLAC) trial. Five methods were used to assess STR: 1) summed %STR across multiple leads (ΣSTR); 2) %STR in the single lead with maximum baseline STE (MaxSTR); 3) absolute maximum STE before the procedure; 4) absolute maximum STE after intervention (MaxSTPost); and 5) a categorical variable based upon MaxSTPost (High Risk). ResultsAt 30 days, ΣSTR, MaxSTR, and MaxSTPost all correlated strongly with mortality (p = 0. 004, p = 0. 005, and p < 0. 0001, respectively) and the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point of mortality or reinfarction (p = 0. 001, p = 0. 001, and p < 0. 0001). At one year, ΣSTR and MaxSTPost correlated with mortality (p = 0. 04, p = 0. 0001), reinfarction (p = 0. 02, p = 0. 0015), and the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point (p = 0. 02, p < 0. 0001). By multivariate analysis, only the simpler measures of MaxSTPost and High Risk categorization independently predicted all outcomes at both time points. ConclusionsThe STR following primary PCI in AMI correlates strongly with mortality and reinfarction, independent of target vessel patency. The simple measure of the maximal residual degree of STE after primary PCI is a strong independent predictor of both survival and freedom from reinfarction at 30 days and 1 year...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—The {{efficacy}} of the antiplatelet agent triflusal for prevention of vascular events after stroke {{has been reported in}} a pilot study. However, {{there is a need to}} confirm those results in a larger study. Methods—We performed a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study to test the {{efficacy of}} triflusal (600 mg/d) versus aspirin (325 mg/d) for prevention of vascular events in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (Triflusal versus Aspirin in Cerebral Infarction Prevention [TACIP]). We assessed a <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point (incidence of nonfatal ischemic stroke, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, or vascular death) as well as the incidence of these events separately and the incidence of major hemorrhage. Results—Of 2113 patients, 1058 received triflusal and 1055 aspirin. The mean follow-up period was 30. 1 months. The incidence of <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point (13. 1 % for triflusal, 12. 4 % for aspirin) as well the survival analysis (hazard ratio [HR] for triflusal versus aspirin, 1. 09; 95 % CI, 0. 85 to 1. 38) showed no differences between groups. The incidence of nonfatal stroke (HR, 1. 09; 95 % CI, 0. 82 to 1. 44), nonfatal acute myocardial infarction (HR, 0. 95; 95 % CI, 0. 46 to 1. 98,) and vascular death (HR, 1. 22; 95 % CI, 0. 75 to 1. 96) was also similar. A significantly higher incidence of major hemorrhages in the aspirin group was recorded (HR, 0. 48; 95 % CI, 0. 28 to 0. 82). The overall incidence of hemorrhage was significantly lower in the triflusal group (16. 7 % versus 25. 2 %) (odds ratio, 0. 76; 95 % CI, 0. 67 to 0. 86; P 0. 001). Conclusions—This study failed to show significantly superior efficacy of triflusal over aspirin in the long-term preventio...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{effect of}} {{regression}} of cirrhosis in chronic hepa-titis C is unknown. Objective: To evaluate {{the relation between}} regression of cirrhosis and clinical outcome in patients with chronic hepatitis C after anti-viral therapy. Design: A cohort of patients with cirrhosis treated between 1988 and 2001. Setting: Hepatology unit of a tertiary care center in France. Patients: 96 patients with chronic hepatitis C and biopsy-proven cirrhosis (METAVIR score F 4) who were treated with an interferon-based regimen and had at least 1 posttreatment liver biopsy. Pa-tients were followed until November 2006. Measurements: Occurrence of a <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point of liver-related events (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver transplantation) and death in patients with regression of cirrhosis (defined as a decrease from 4 to 2 METAVIR units on post-therapy liver biopsy). Results: The median follow-up was 118 months (interquartile range, 86 to 138 months). Eighteen patients had regression of cirrhosis. The incidence of the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point per 100 patient-years was 0 in patients with regression of cirrhosis and 4 in patients without regression of cirrhosis (P 0. 002, log-rank test). The trans-plantation-free survival rate at 10 years was 100 % in patients with regression of cirrhosis and 74. 2 % in patients without regression of cirrhosis (P 0. 025). Limitations: Selection of patients was retrospective; selection and survival biases may have influenced the estimates of the overall rate of regression of cirrhosis. The low number of patients who experi-enced regression of cirrhosis precludes analysis of factors that could predict regression of cirrhosis. Conclusion: Regression of cirrhosis occurs after antiviral therapy in some patients with chronic hepatitis C. Regression is associated with decreased disease-related morbidity and improved survival...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the relation between antiplatelet agent (APA) use and survival and morbidity from cardiac disease in patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Background. APAs {{play an important role}} in the prevention and treatment of coronary disease. Their effects in patients with LV systolic dysfunction are unknown. Methods. We reviewed data on APA use in 6, 797 patients enrolled in the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) trial and analyzed the relation between their use and all-cause mortality as well as the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point of death or hospital admission for heart failure (HF). We used Cox regression to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics and to test for the interaction between APA use and selected patient variables in relation to outcome. Results. APA use (46. 3 % of patients) was associated with significantly reduced mortality from all causes (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0. 82, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 73 to 0. 92, p = 0. 0005) and reduced risk of death or hospital admission for HF (adjusted HR 0. 81, 95 % CI 0. 74 to 0. 89, p < 0. 0001) but was not influenced by trial assignment, gender, LV ejection fraction, New York Heart Association class or etiology. A strong interaction was observed among APA use, randomization group and all-cause mortality. The association between APA use and survival was not observed in the enalapril group, nor was an enalapril benefit on survival detectable in patients receiving APAs at baseline. However, randomization to enalapril therapy significantly reduced the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point of death or hospital admission for HF in APA users. Conclusions. In patients with LV systolic dysfunction, use of APAs is associated with improved survival and reduced morbidity. This association is retained after adjustment for baseline characteristics. APA use is associated with retained but reduced benefit from enalapril...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe present {{analysis}} {{examines the}} prognostic implications of moderate renal insufficiency {{in patients with}} asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. BACKGROUNDChronic elevations in intracardiac filling pressures may lead to progressive ventricular dilation and heart failure progression. The ability to maintain fluid balance and prevent increased intracardiac filling pressures is critically dependent on the adequacy of renal function. METHODSThis is a retrospective analysis of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) Trials, in which moderate renal insufficiency {{is defined as a}} baseline creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min, as estimated from the Cockroft-Gault equation. RESULTSIn the SOLVD Prevention Trial, multivariate analyses demonstrated moderate renal insufficiency to be associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality (Relative Risk [RR] 1. 41; p = 0. 001), largely explained by an increased risk for pump-failure death (RR 1. 68;p = 0. 007) and the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point death or hospitalization for heart failure (RR 1. 33; p = 0. 001). Likewise, in the Treatment Trial, multivariate analyses demonstrated moderate renal insufficiency to be associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality (RR 1. 41;p = 0. 001), also largely explained by an increased risk for pump-failure death (RR 1. 49; p = 0. 007) and the <b>combined</b> <b>end</b> point death or hospitalization for heart failure (RR 1. 45; p = 0. 001). CONCLUSIONSEven moderate degrees of renal insufficiency are independently associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure, largely explained by an increased risk of heart failure progression. These data suggest that, rather than simply being a marker of the severity of underlying disease, the adequacy of renal function may be a primary determinant of compensation in patients with heart failure, and therapy capable of improving renal function may delay disease progression...|$|R

Background: Low-grade inflammation as detected by elevated CRP levels predicts the risk of recurrent coronary events. The effect of inflammation on coronary risk may be attenuated by statin therapy. Methods: We investigated a potential interrelation among statin therapy, serum evidence of inflammation, and the risk for recurrent coronary events in 388 consecutive patients undergoing coronary stent implantation. Patients were grouped according to the median CRP level (0. 6 mg/dl) and {{to the presence of}} statin therapy.
