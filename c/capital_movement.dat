2500|$|A [...] {{common market}} was {{launched}} on 1 January 2008 {{with plans to}} realise a fully integrated single market. It eased the movement of goods and services. However, implementation lagged behind after the 2009 financial crisis. The creation of a customs union began in 2003 and was completed and fully operational on 1 January 2015. In January 2015, the common market was also further integrated, allowing full equality among GCC citizens {{to work in the}} government and private sectors, social insurance and retirement coverage, real estate ownership, <b>capital</b> <b>movement,</b> access to education, health and other social services in all member states. However, some barriers remained in the free movement of goods and services. The coordination of taxation systems, accounting standards and civil legislation is currently in progress. The interoperability of professional qualifications, insurance certificates and identity documents is also underway.|$|E
2500|$|Hitler's Four Year Plan {{called for}} a modernized {{expanded}} agricultural sector to free Germany from the fear of a blockade, a network of motorways, remodeled cities, a massive program of import-substitution to supply synthetic strategic material and military industries capable of out-producing the largest enemy economy. The plan required a rigid structure of six main economic divisions: raw materials production, raw materials distribution, labor agriculture, price control and foreign exchange. It made heavy demands on resources already in short supply because of high military spending, resulting in the delay or postponement of most programs while scrambling for raw materials, building workers and engineering equipment. [...] Pseudo markets were created to attempt {{to make the system}} work more efficiently. In response to blat-like commerce arising, Germany passed laws labeling such unsanctioned commerce as [...] "economic sabotage" [...] punishable by death. [...] German regulation of private property and <b>capital</b> <b>movement</b> hardened, and property could be seized from political enemies such as ethnic Jews or communists.|$|E

Arbitrage in perfectly integrated finan-cial markets instantaneously eliminates yield differentials through valuation adjustments. But {{the stock}} adjustments {{that constitute the}} essence of net <b>capital</b> <b>movements</b> may also be impeded by imperfections in the real sector. Perfect mobility of funds, therefore, does not imply the absence of all impediments to international <b>capital</b> <b>movements.</b> They may be restrained, i. a., by differences in national term structures of interest, by real exchange rate expectations, or by industrial structure and intersectoral factor mobility...|$|R
2500|$|Free {{movement}} of capital was traditionally {{seen as the}} fourth freedom, after goods, workers and persons, services and establishment. The original Treaty of Rome required that restrictions on free capital flows only be removed {{to the extent necessary}} for the common market. From the Treaty of Maastricht, now in TFEU article 63, [...] "all restrictions on the {{movement of}} capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited". This means capital controls of various kinds are prohibited, including limits on buying currency, limits on buying company shares or financial assets, or government approval requirements for foreign investment. By contrast, taxation of capital, including corporate tax, capital gains tax and Financial transaction tax are not affected so long as they do not discriminate by nationality. According to the <b>Capital</b> <b>Movement</b> Directive 1988, Annex I, 13 categories of capital which must move free are covered. In Baars v Inspecteur der Belastingen Particulieren the Court of Justice held that for investments in companies, the capital rules, rather than freedom of establishment rules, were engaged if an investment did not enable a [...] "definite influence" [...] through shareholder voting or other rights by the investor. That case held a Dutch Wealth Tax Act 1964 unjustifiably exempted Dutch investments, but not Mr Baars' investments in an Irish company, from the tax: the wealth tax, or exemptions, had to be applied equally. On the other hand, TFEU article 65(1) does not prevent taxes that distinguish taxpayers based on their residence or the location of an investment (as taxes commonly focus on a person's actual source of profit) or any measures to prevent tax evasion. Apart from tax cases, largely following from the opinions of Advocate General Maduro, a series of cases held that government owned golden shares were unlawful. In Commission v Germany the Commission claimed the German Volkswagen Act 1960 violated article 63, in that §2(1) restricted any party having voting rights exceeding 20% of the company, and §4(3) allowed a minority of 20% of shares held by the Lower Saxony government to block any decisions. Although this was not an impediment to actual purchase of shares, or receipt of dividends by any shareholder, the Court of Justice's Grand Chamber agreed that it was disproportionate for the government's stated aim of protecting workers or minority shareholders. Similarly, in Commission v Portugal the Court of Justice held that Portugal infringed free movement of capital by retaining golden shares in Portugal Telecom that enabled disproportionate voting rights, by creating a [...] "deterrent effect on portfolio investments" [...] and reduing [...] "the attractiveness of an investment". This suggested the Court's preference that a government, if it sought public ownership or control, should nationalise in full the desired proportion of a company in line with TFEU article 345.|$|E

5000|$|Although the {{perception}} {{by the public}} {{may be that the}} [...] "central bank" [...] controls some or all interest rates and currency rates, economic theory (and substantial empirical evidence) shows {{that it is impossible to}} do both at once in an open economy. Robert Mundell's [...] "impossible trinity" [...] is the most famous formulation of these limited powers, and postulates that it is impossible to target monetary policy (broadly, interest rates), the exchange rate (through a fixed rate) and maintain free <b>capital</b> <b>movement.</b> Since most Western economies are now considered [...] "open" [...] with free <b>capital</b> <b>movement,</b> this essentially means that central banks may target interest rates or exchange rates with credibility, but not both at once.|$|E

30|$|Second, capital {{accounts}} should be opened and managed simultaneously, to reduce risks. Portfolio investments, especially the fast inflow and outflow of international capitals, have unpredictable impacts on an economy {{and may even}} amplify economic fluctuations and threaten macroeconomic stability in certain periods affected by the animal spirit. We suggest applying risk management measures to short-term international <b>capital</b> <b>movements</b> {{as part of the}} macroprudential framework. The possible measures include emergency threshold management, Tobin tax (Chen & Wang 2007; Yi 2015), and others.

50|$|The {{debate of}} making a choice between fixed and {{floating}} exchange rate regimes is set forth by the Mundell-Fleming model, which argues that an economy (or the government) cannot simultaneously maintain a fixed exchange rate, free <b>capital</b> <b>movement,</b> and an independent monetary policy.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to integrate the}} theory of trade with that of <b>capital</b> <b>movements,</b> and to study the two country world where each nation has a different rate of time preference. It resolves the indeterminacy problem intrinsic in the Heckscher-Ohlin model where trade and factor movements coexist by assuming that <b>capital</b> <b>movements</b> are infinitesimally more costly than trade in goods. Under certain assumptions, one can dichotomize the behavior of asset accumulation from the dynamic pattern of trade specialization. Complete specialization will take place most likely {{in the country with}} a higher rate of time preference, which specializes into the more labor-intensive sector. It is shown that a single-commodity model does exaggerate the amount of <b>capital</b> <b>movements,</b> but that the qualitative nature of asset accumulation patterns obtained in a single-commodity model of <b>capital</b> <b>movements</b> holds intact in the model that incorporates trade. This paper offers another explanation to the Feldstein-Horioka paradox that domestic investment responds more closely to increasing savings than capital outflows do. If an economy is imperfectly specialized, increased savings will be absorbed in capital deepening rather than in capital outflow. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Capital</b> <b>movements</b> {{offset the}} {{surpluses}} or deficits {{in the current}} account. A current account surplus, for example, implies that rather than using all the foreign currency earned by selling exports to buy imports, corporations and individuals choose to invest the money in foreign-currency-denominated assets instead. As measured in Japan's balance of payments data, <b>capital</b> <b>movements</b> consist of long- and short-term investments and movements in official foreign exchange reserves and private bank accounts. <b>Capital</b> <b>movements</b> include loans, portfolio investments in corporate stock, and direct investment (establishment or purchase of subsidiaries abroad). A capital outflow occurs when a Japanese individual or corporation makes a loan, buys foreign stock, or establishes a subsidiary abroad. A capital inflow occurs when foreigners engage in these operations in Japan.|$|R
