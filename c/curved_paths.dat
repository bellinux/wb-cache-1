Loosely speaking, first order derivatives are related to tangents of curves. Still for <b>curved</b> <b>paths,</b> the acceleration is directed towards the center of curvature of the path.

25|$|In 1953 Iosif Shklovsky {{proposed}} that the diffuse blue region is predominantly produced by synchrotron radiation, which is radiation given off by the curving motion of electrons in a magnetic field. The radiation corresponded to electrons moving at speeds up to half the speed of light. Three years later the theory was confirmed by observations. In the 1960s {{it was found that}} the source of the <b>curved</b> <b>paths</b> of the electrons was the strong magnetic field produced by a neutron star at the centre of the nebula.|$|E
25|$|In graded-index fiber, {{the index}} of {{refraction}} in the core decreases continuously between the axis and the cladding. This causes light rays to bend smoothly as they approach the cladding, rather than reflecting abruptly from the core-cladding boundary. The resulting <b>curved</b> <b>paths</b> reduce multi-path dispersion because high angle rays pass more through the lower-index periphery of the core, rather than the high-index center. The index profile is chosen to minimize the difference in axial propagation speeds of the various rays in the fiber. This ideal index profile {{is very close to}} a parabolic relationship between the index and the distance from the axis.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} part of the cemetery was built between 1945 and 1947 by Herta Hammerbacher, and expanded from 1948 to 1954 by Max Dietrich. About a third of the area was forest, which was already 50 years old and was intentionally kept. The trees are mostly firs, with a few oaks, mountain-ashes and birches. Two straight paths in north-south direction structure the cemetery, connected by <b>curved</b> <b>paths.</b> The funeral halls are situated on a natural hill. Between the entrance and the halls is a large U-shaped meadow which was originally designed as heath. The graves are arranged in rows, both in the meadow part as in the forest part.|$|E

Animation was also improved to allow characters to lean realistically when moving in <b>curved</b> <b>paths.</b> Rendering and artificial intelligence were scaled up {{to allow for a}} greater number of enemies who can navigate the world in better ways, such as climbing, jumping, or breaking obstacles. Lighting was enhanced with new self-shadowing normal mapping and advanced shadow rendering that is important to convey information about the environment and player actions. Wet surfaces and fog are used to create mood. Many kinds of post processing cinematic visual effects inspired by horror movies {{have been added to the}} game. There is dynamic color correction that accentuates details based on importance, contrast and sharpening to focus attention on critical areas, film grain to expose details or imply details in dark areas and vignetting to evoke tension and a horror-film look.|$|E

2500|$|To {{a modern}} {{physicist}} working with Einstein's {{general theory of}} relativity, the situation is even more complicated than is suggested above. Einstein's theory suggests that it actually is valid to consider that objects in inertial motion (such as falling in an elevator, or in a parabola in an airplane, or orbiting a planet) can indeed be considered to experience a local loss of the gravitational field in their rest frame. Thus, in {{the point of view}} (or frame) of the astronaut or orbiting ship, there actually is nearly-zero proper acceleration (the acceleration felt locally), just as would be the case far out in space, away from any mass. It is thus valid to consider that most of the gravitational field in such situations is actually absent {{from the point of view}} of the falling observer, just as the colloquial view suggests (see equivalence principle for a fuller explanation of this point). However, this loss of gravity for the falling or orbiting observer, in Einstein's theory, is due to the falling motion itself, and (again as in Newton's theory) not due to increased distance from the Earth. However, the gravity nevertheless is considered to be absent. In fact, Einstein's realization that a pure gravitational interaction cannot be felt, if all other forces are removed, was the key insight to leading him to the view that the gravitational [...] "force" [...] can in some ways be viewed as non-existent. Rather, objects tend to follow geodesic paths in curved space-time, and this is [...] "explained" [...] as a force, by [...] "Newtonian" [...] observers who assume that space-time is [...] "flat," [...] and thus do not have a reason for <b>curved</b> <b>paths</b> (i.e., the [...] "falling motion" [...] of an object near a gravitational source).|$|E
