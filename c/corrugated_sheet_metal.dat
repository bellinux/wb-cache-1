5|$|Number 16 is a {{house is}} two storey building, roughly square in plan, with painted {{limestone}} walls and a <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> roof behind a parapet. It accommodated first the superintendent, later on the resident magistrate, and remained in-use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s. Number 18, {{also known as the}} Surgeon's House, is a two storey structure with limestone walls. It is the southernmost house on The Terrace. Numbers 18 and 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, water closet and shed, but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s. A single storey limestone structure (former stables) is located to the south of Number 18.|$|E
25|$|The First United Methodist Church of Ponce is a {{magnificent}} example of early 20th-century eclecticism, integrating Neo-Gothic, Spanish Revival, Spanish Baroque, and byzantine elements. It is constructed entirely of rusticated, reinforced-concrete with gabled wood and <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> roofs.

500|$|Foreign {{architectural}} influences, having arisen {{through increased}} European contact {{over the course}} of the 19th century, intensified dramatically with the advent of French colonization in 1896. [...] Over the past several decades, the increasing availability of relatively inexpensive modern construction materials imported from China and elsewhere has further reinforced a growing trend in urban areas away from traditional architectural styles in favor of more durable but generic structures using industrially produced materials such as concrete and sheet metal. Certain modern innovations may be more highly esteemed than others. In the Manambondro region, for instance, <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> roofing was typically the least expensive and prestigious and most common addition to a traditional house. The replacement of locally sourced wood frames with factory-milled lumber was the next most common house modification, followed by the laying of a concrete foundation. Houses built entirely of concrete with glass windows and imported decorative balcony railings and window bars implied great wealth and the highest social status. Although low income levels have served to preserve traditional construction among the majority of the population of Madagascar, due to the prestige associated with modern architectural innovations, traditional construction is often abandoned as income increases.|$|E

50|$|The ANT-20 was {{designed}} by Andrei Tupolev, using all-metal airframe technology devised by German engineer Hugo Junkers during the World War I years, as the largest-ever aircraft to use Junkers' original all-metal aircraft design techniques from 1918, being constructed between 4 July 1933 and 3 April 1934. It {{was one of two}} aircraft of its kind built by the Soviets. The aircraft was named after Maksim Gorki and dedicated to the 40th anniversary of his literary and public activities. The ANT-20 was the largest known aircraft to have used the Junkers aviation firm's late-World War I-devised design philosophy of <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> for many of the airframe's key components, especially the <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> skinning of the airframe.|$|E

5000|$|The {{building}} {{had fallen into}} disrepair when the Easley Chamber of Commerce applied for its recognition {{as one of the}} most-endangered properties in the state.

50|$|Corrugated {{galvanised}} iron or steel (colloquially corrugated iron (near universal), wriggly tin (taken from UK military slang), pailing (in Caribbean English), <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> (in North America) and occasionally abbreviated CGI) is a building material composed of sheets of hot-dip galvanised mild steel, cold-rolled {{to produce a}} linear corrugated pattern in them.

40|$|The use of {{laterite}} {{based material}} as {{ceramic roof tile}} contributes to the innovation and application of local materials within our immediate environment. In this study {{the aim is to}} design and produce corrugated laterite based roof tile and investigate its water absorption and penetration. Paste of laterite-cement mix was formed with water to cement ratio of 3 : 1. The percentage composition of the cement used was 15 % and 20 %. The paste was poured into a wooden frame (dimension of 200 mm x 300 mm x 20 mm) with an underlying <b>corrugated</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheet,</b> while another <b>corrugated</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheet</b> was placed on the paste to ensure formation of the corrugated shape on both sides. Water analysis carried out on the cast samples showed that the sample with 20 % cement composition had a better resistance to water absorption and penetration. The result of this study indicates that the formation of corrugated roofing tile using laterite material is feasible and it is possible to have good water resistant property if fully optimized...|$|R
50|$|Several {{different}} manufacturing {{techniques can}} be used to create the complex geometry necessary for regenerative cooling. These include a <b>corrugated</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheet</b> brazed between the inner and outer liner; hundreds of pipes brazed into the correct shape, or an inner liner with milled cooling channels and an outer liner around that. The geometry can also be created through direct metal 3D printing, as seen on some newer designs such as the SpaceX SuperDraco rocket engine.|$|R
