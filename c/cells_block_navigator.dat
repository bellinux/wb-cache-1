40|$|BACKGROUND Cytological {{examination}} of serous fluid is a commonly performed and well accepted procedure. It helps in diagnosis {{as well as}} prognosis of the disease, thus helping in management of the patients. But, diagnosis by conventional cytology is often difficult due to presence of reactive mesothelial cells, abundance of inflammatory background, delaying artifact, air drying, poor fixation and leaving behind useful material causes lower diagnostic yield in conventional smear. <b>Cell</b> <b>block</b> technique {{is one of the}} oldest and complementary method and takes an intermediate position between histological and cytological method. <b>Cell</b> <b>block</b> preparation increases the sensitivity of detecting malignancies and also has the ability to reduce false-positive interpretations. Gelatin <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> is a simplified, inexpensive and reproducible technique that produces results, which are equivalent to routine <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> and it can be an adjuvant to conventional smear in evaluation of cytological effusions. MATERIALS AND METHODS In our study, we analysed 100 fluid samples pleural (65) and ascitic (35) by both conventional cytology (pap and giemsa staining) and <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> technique. We modified <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> method by gelatin <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> technique using gelatin surgical dressing material. RESULTS Our results showed that gelatin <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> was superior to conventional cytology by reducing false-negative results and provided more accurate diagnosis. It also reduced the grey zone for suspicious of malignancy. Gelatin <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> were more simplified and reduced the mean time of making of <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> and thus are strongly recommended for <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> method than other methods for <b>cell</b> <b>block.</b> CONCLUSION To conclude, the present study showed that <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> technique, which used gelatin as fixative was a simple, reproducible and inexpensive method, which does not require any special instrument or training. This method yielded more cellularity with better architectural patterns. Hence, the gelatin <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> technique can be recommended as an adjuvant in evaluating the fluid cytology for a final diagnosis along with routine conventional smear method...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The cytological {{examination}} of aspirates of serous effusions is a routinely accepted, simple, safe and minimally invasive technique. Diagnosis in this investigation, especially in malignant effusions, helps in staging, prognosis {{and management of}} the patients. AIMS: To assess the utility and sensitivity of <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> method over conventional smear technique in cytodiagnosis of the serous effusions. METHODS: A total of 72 fluid specimens were subjected to simultaneous processing by conventional s mear and <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> technique. Each fluid specimen was divided into two equal parts and results compared for cellularity, cell architecture, cytoplasmic and nuclear features. <b>Cell</b> <b>blocks</b> were prepared using modified <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> technique using alcohol forma lin fixative.

40|$|AIMS: To review {{consecutive}} <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> preparations of cytological specimens {{in a large}} general hospital. METHODS: 50 <b>cell</b> <b>blocks</b> {{were made}} over an 18 month period in which about 1900 fine needle aspirations (FNAs) were performed. The aspirator was a cytologist or, for image guided FNAs, a radiologist with a cytologist at hand to collect the specimen. Forty eight <b>cell</b> <b>blocks</b> were from FNAs and two were from serous fluids. RESULTS: The cellularity of the <b>cell</b> <b>blocks</b> was inadequate in only four preparations. The main motive for making <b>cell</b> <b>blocks</b> was to obtain tissue for immunohistochemistry. This was performed on 28 cases {{and a total of}} 107 immunostained sections were produced. The most common diagnostic dilemma was between carcinoma and melanoma, and the second most common between carcinoma and lymphoma. Consequently cytokeratin, S- 100, and LCA were the most frequently used antibodies. At least one of these three antibodies was positive in 17 cases. Five cases were immunostained only for prognostic breast markers. CONCLUSIONS: The use of <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> immunohistochemistry is a reliable and technically unsophisticated aid in the cytological examination of tumours other than lymphomas.

40|$|Introduction. To improve testing sensitivity, most {{laboratories}} use {{two or more}} {{preparation methods}} but in our laboratories only one method is used which is "direct smear". In this study we tried to evaluate the diagnostic value of <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> as adjunct to direct smear in the cytologic investigation of serosal cavities fluids. &# 13; Methods. In a clinical trial study 62 specimens of serosal cavity fluids were investigated in AL-Zahrapathology laboratory (Get. 1998 to Get. 1999). Cytologic slides from each specimens were prepared in two methods: direct smear and <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> (plasma- thrombin clot method). Smears and <b>cell</b> <b>blocks</b> were studied separately by the same cytopathologist. The diagnosis were categorized as positive, negative, suspicious or unsatisfactory. Also, the time required for studing of each slides were noted. &# 13; Findings. The findings indicated that there are discrepancy between direct smear and <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> methods {{in the number of}} "suspicious" cases. Also there is significant difference between the mean time needed for studing of direct smear and <b>cell</b> <b>block.</b> &# 13; Conclusion. It is recommended that the remainer of each specimen should be kept in refrigerator in order to prepare <b>cell</b> <b>blocks</b> in suspicious cases of direct smear.

40|$|Abstract Background Conventional smears {{of samples}} {{obtained}} by endobronchial ultrasound with real-time transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) have proven useful in lung cancer staging, but {{the value of}} additional information from cell-block processing of EBUS-TBNA samples has only been marginally investigated. This study focussed on the contribution of <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> analysis to the diagnostic yield in lung cancer. Methods Patients referred for lung cancer diagnosis and/or staging by means of EBUS-TBNA were enrolled, {{the adequacy of the}} obtained samples for preparing <b>cell</b> <b>blocks</b> was assessed, and the additional pathologic or genetic information provided from <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> analysis was examined. Results In 270 lung cancer patients referred for EBUS-TBNA (mean age, 63. 3 SD 10. 4 years) 697 aspirations were performed. <b>Cell</b> <b>blocks</b> could be obtained from 334 aspirates (47. 9 %) and contained diagnostic material in 262 (37. 6 %) aspirates, providing information that was additional to conventional smears in 50 of the 189 samples with smears that were non-diagnostic, corresponding 21 of these blocks to malignant nodes, and allowing lung cancer subtyping of 4 samples. Overall, <b>cell</b> <b>blocks</b> improved the pathologic diagnosis attained with conventional smears in 54 of the 697 samples obtained with EBUS-TBNA (7. 7 %). <b>Cell</b> <b>blocks</b> obtained during EBUS-TBNA also made epithelial growth factor receptor mutation analysis possible in 39 of the 64 patients with TBNA samples showing metastatic adenocarcinoma (60. 1 %). Overall, <b>cell</b> <b>blocks</b> provided clinically significant information for 83 of the 270 patients participating in the study (30. 7 %). Conclusions Cell-block preparation from EBUS-TBNA samples is a simple way to provide additional information in lung cancer diagnosis.

40|$|Background: One of the {{constraints}} of the conventional FNA smear is the limited material available for adjuvant diagnostic investigations including immunocytochemistry. The <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> technique employs the retrieval of small tissue fragments from a FNA specimen which are processed to form a paraffin block. It is widely accepted that <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> technique increases the cellular yield and improves diagnostic accuracy. The ability to obtain numerous tissue sections allows for multiple immunostains and other studies to be performed akin to paraffin sections produced in histopathology. Aims: To determine the effectiveness of the <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> technique by comparing cytomorphological preservation and immunocytochemistry (ICC) stains on paired <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> and conventional fine needle aspiration (FNA) samples. Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, material for both glass slides and <b>cell</b> <b>blocks</b> were collected simultaneously during fine needle aspirates from 47 samples comprising lung and liver masses. Grading of cellularity, morphological preservation, architectural preservation, immunocytochemical staining intensity and presence of background staining on paired FNA smears and <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> samples were compared. Each arm of the paired analysis was performed blindly without knowledge of the grading outcome of the other. The Kappa statistic (κ) was used to measure inter-rater agreement. Results: The 47 samples evaluated included FNAs from the lung, 24 / 47 (51 %) and liver, 23 / 47 (49 %). The immunocytochemistry stains consisted of 44 / 47 (94 %) CK 7; 44 / 47 (94 %) CK 20; 18 / 47 (38 %) TTF 1; 10 / 47 (21 %) synaptophysin; 10 / 47 (21 %) Hepar- 1 and 7 / 47 (15 %) AE 1 / 3. There was no overall agreement in preservation of cytomorphological detail and ICC staining between the two methods. The Papanicolaou-stained conventional FNA smears fared better than the <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> for the evaluation of nuclear and morphologic characteristics. The ICC stains worked better on the <b>cell</b> <b>block</b> samples due to lack of background and aberrant staining. Conclusion: Direct FNA smears and <b>cell</b> <b>blocks</b> complement each other and our results indicate that both are needed in the diagnostic work-up of patients.
