This new constitution gave Park effective control over the parliament and the possibility of permanent presidency. The president would be elected through indirect election by an elected body, and the term of presidency was extended to six years with no restrictions on reappointment. The legislature and judiciary were <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> and educational guidelines were under direct surveillance as well. Textbooks supporting the ideology of the military government were authorized by the government, diminishing the responsibilities of the Ministry of Education.|$|E

25|$|The {{communist}} {{government of the}} People's Republic of China tries to maintain tight control over all religions, so the only legal Christian Churches (Three-Self Patriotic Movement and Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association) are those under the Communist Party of China control.

Gong Shengliang, head of the South China Church, {{was sentenced to death}} in 2001. Although his sentence was commuted to a jail sentence, Amnesty International reports that he has been tortured. A Christian lobby group says that about 300 Christians caught attending unregistered house churches were in jail in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Under this {{ascendancy}} of the military, the country developed a very hierarchical, aristocratic economic system with significant state involvement. During the Meiji Restoration, {{there had been}} a surge in the creation of monopolies. This was in part due to state intervention, as the monopolies served to allow Japan to become a world economic power. The state itself owned some of the monopolies, and others were owned by the zaibatsu. The monopolies managed the central core of the economy, with other aspects being <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> ministry appropriate to the activity, including the National Central Bank and the Imperial family. This economic arrangement was in many ways similar to the later corporatist models of European fascists.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{there are}} three {{transmission}} companies which operate the high-voltage Interconnecting Trunk System (STI), {{the backbone of the}} SIN. ENDE Corporation, ISA Bolivia, which was created in 2005, and San Cristobal TESA.

As of 2013, its transmission network extended 2,850km, representing 79% of the national total. ISA Bolivia, which runs 587km, or 16%, of the transmission network in Bolivia, is a subsidiary of Interconexión Eléctrica S.A. (ISA), a corporation <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of Colombia. San Cristobal TESA has 172km of transmission lines, or 5%. The number of companies is limited due to the existence of institutional entry barriers in this sector.|$|E
