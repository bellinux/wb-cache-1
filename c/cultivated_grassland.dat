40|$|The {{establishment}} of grasslands on abandoned cropland {{has been proposed}} as an effective method to mitigate climate change. In this study, five <b>cultivated</b> <b>grasslands</b> (three leguminous species and two gramineous species), one abandoned cropland, and one natural grassland were studied to examine how soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rate and sequestration efficiency change in a semi-arid area in China. Our results showed that leguminous grasslands had greater total biomass (above- and belowground biomass), SOC storage, SOC sequestration rate, and efficiency than gramineous grasslands, abandoned cropland, and natural grassland during the experimental period. The largest soil carbon (C) accumulation in leguminous grassland was mainly attributed to the capacity to incorporate C and the higher biomass production. Leguminous grasslands accumulated more SOC than gramineous grasslands by 0. 64  Mg C ha − 1  yr − 1. The average SOC sequestration efficiency in leguminous grassland (1. 00) was about 2  times greater than gramineous grassland (0. 34).

30|$|According to the literature, the Scarabeidae (Coleoptera) species, mainly {{responsible}} for grub damage in Austrian alpine grasslands, are the cockchafers (Melolontha melolontha and M. hippocastani), the garden chafer (Phyllopertha horticola) and, {{to a lesser}} degree, the June beetle (Amphimallon solstitiale; Pötsch et al. 1997, Traugott 2003, Strasser 2004 a, Keller and Zimmermann 2005).

40|$|Turnover of soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) is coupled to the cycling of {{nutrients}} in soil through the activity of soil microorganisms. Biological availability of organic substrate in soil {{is related to the}} chemical quality of the organic material and to its degree of physical protection. SOM fractions can provide information on the turnover of organic matter (OM), provided the fractions can be related to functional or structural components in soil. Ultrasonication is commonly used to disrupt the soil structure prior to physical fractionation according to particle size, but may cause redistribution of OM among size fractions. The presence of mineral particles in size fractions can complicate estimations of OM turnover time within the fractions. Densiometric separation allows one to physically separate OM found within a specific size class from the heavier-density mineral particles. Nutrient contents and mineralization potential were determined for discrete size/density OM fractions isolated from within the macroaggregate structure of <b>cultivated</b> <b>grassland</b> soils. Eighteen percent of the total soil C and 25 % of the total soil N in no-till soil was associated with fine-silt size particles having a density of 2. 07 - 2. 21 g/cm 3 isolated from inside macroaggregates (enriched labile fraction or ELF). The amount of C and N sequestered in the ELF fraction decreased as the intensity of tillage increased. The specific rate of mineralization (mug net mineral N/mug total N in the fraction) for macroaggregate-derived ELF was not different for the three tillage treatments but was greater than for intact macroaggregates. The methods described here have improved our ability to quantitatively estimate SOM fractions, which in turn has increased our understanding of SOM dynamics in <b>cultivated</b> <b>grassland</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|Because {{of changes}} in land use, the {{quantity}} of extensively grazed or mown calcareous grasslands and their successional stages have drastically declined {{over the last few}} decades in Central Europe. Old fallow land has decreased most. It is often afforested or reconverted into extensively <b>cultivated</b> <b>grassland</b> because extensive cultivation is believed to be favorable for diversity and rare species conservation. The relative importance of fallow calcareous grasslands, however, has not been investigated fully and might be much underestimated. To evaluate the relative importance of extensively grazed pastures, early and old fallow land, and young forest, we examined populations of diurnal butterflies from 14 sites in the Swiss Jura Mountains. We used univariate, multivariate, and qualitative methods to compare the successional stages. The first 2 - 3 years of succession had little influence on the butterfly fauna. Therefore, pastures and early fallow land were treated as a single "early stage. " Old fallow land had significantly higher species richness (+ 32 %) and heterogeneity (+ 65 %) and hosted more Red List species (+ 48 %) than the early stage. Young forest was depauperate in butterfly species. Further, cluster analysis and correspondence analysis showed a close resemblance of the sites of the early stage to each other and a clear difference from the sites of old fallow land. All differences were best explained by the successional age of the sites. Both early stage and old fallow land showed a high proportion (< 25 %) of stage-specific species, but more threatened species were specific to old fallow land. We conclude that up to now the importance of old fallow land has been underestimated in conservation efforts in Central Europe. Contrary to the prevailing opinion, it is at least as important for butterflies as extensively <b>cultivated</b> <b>grassland.</b> Further conversion into forest, a common habitat in the region, should be prevented. Because old fallow land has becomeexceedingly rare, its inclusion in management plans is urgently needed. Otherwise, we may soon lose a valuable but often overlooked part of our biodiversity. Betr.

The relationship for soil carbon across the vegetation matrix boundary resembles a step function, with no detectable difference between core and edge in the same land management category.

The aim of our study was to assess how mixed crop-livestock farms, specifically breeding dairy or suckler cows, integrate grassland into their global functioning and to know the farmers' position about grass management. Livestock farms were surveyed and the collected data were analysed by multidimensional statistical analysis. Even though maize silage is the main fodder resource in this region now, we observed a large diversity of types in the more or less intensive uses of grassland. We identified two main strategies of grassland management. In the first type, farms combine grazed grassland and maize silage considered as forage security. In the second type, the farmers’ choice of including <b>cultivated</b> <b>grassland</b> in crop rotations has both advantageous objectives: improving forage self-sufficiency (intensive use of grass for grazing or hay making) and decreasing the risk of runoff.

40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} is an {{effective}} indicator of soil resource condition that reflects functional traits such as aggregation, infiltration and microbial activity and plays {{a critical role in}} sustaining production and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. Agricultural practices typically reduce soil carbon levels through the action of soil disturbance and consequent mineralisation.

This study investigated the impact of changing solar zenith angles and diffuse/direct light conditions on the consistency of vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and green-red vegetation index (GRVI)) derived from ground-based spectral measurements in three different types of cropland (paddy field, upland field, <b>cultivated</b> <b>grassland)</b> in Japan.

We recorded 36 raptor species among 2, 533 individuals, dominated by Black Kite Milvus migrans, which comprised 42 % of counts. Although richness and diversity were not related to land-use for Palearctic raptors, Afrotropical raptor diversity was higher on the flooded grasslands compared to the newly created cultivated habitats and dry grasslands. The abundance of Afrotropical raptors did not significantly differ across habitats but was lower in rice-fields when Black Kite and Hooded Vulture Necrosyrtes monachus were excluded. Conversely, Palearctic raptor abundance was highest in post-harvest rice fields, demonstrating the importance of the rice fields as foraging habitat for Palearctic raptors. Further transformation of West Africa’s flood-plains is expected, reducing their capacity for Afrotropical raptors, while Palearctic raptors may benefit from expansion of rice-fields, but more research is needed on their vulnerability to pesticide use...|$|R

Nevertheless, the factors responsible {{for the development of}} large grub populations and the associated damage risk are poorly understood. The objectives of the study were to survey grub densities in grassland sites with different damage histories and find correlations with environmental and management variables. Data on grub densities were collected at 10 farms in the eastern Austrian Alps in September and October 2011. At each farm, one recently damaged site (high risk) and one site at which grub damage had never been observed by the farmers (undamaged site[*]=[*]low risk; each site: 500  m 2) were sampled. All sites were dominated by P. horticola (99 % of 1, 422 collected individuals; maximum density 303 grubs/m 2), which indicates that grub damage there is mainly caused by that species. Recently damaged sites tended to higher grub densities than undamaged sites. However, 3 out of 10 undamaged sites harbored high grub populations as well. Humus content together with the depth of the A-horizon significantly explained 38 % of P. horticola grub density variance, with highest densities in deeper humus-rich soils. The risk of grub damage was positively connected to the humus content and negatively related to the cutting frequency. For the investigated mountainous grassland sites, these results suggest an important role of humus for the development of high grub densities and an effect of management intensity on grub damage.|$|E

The main goal is extracting the larch spectral signal on Landsat 8 (LS 8) Operational Land Imager (OLI) images using ground measurements with the Cropscan Multispectral Radiometer with five bands (MSR 5) simultaneously to satellite overpasses in summer 2015. First, the relationship between field spectrometer and OLI data on a <b>cultivated</b> <b>grassland</b> area next to the forest stand is investigated.

In order to determine larch tree and shadow fractions on OLI pixels, a representative 3 D tree shape is used to construct a digital forest. Benefits of this approach are the computational savings compared to a radiative transfer modeling. Remaining shortcomings are the limited capability to consider exact tree shapes and nonlinear processes. Different methods to implement shadows are tested and spectral vegetation indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Greenness Index (GI) can be computed even without considering shadows...|$|E

Sheep grazed the whole area for one month in spring and autumn. During the summer, the area was assigned to three replicated treatments: (1) control with no management; (2) grazing heifers; and (3) grazing sheep with off€spring. Th e stocking rate was 1. 8 LU ha- 1, in both b and c, for a duration of one month. Th e area was left resting for a month a er treatment and before autumn sheep grazing. Pasture production and herbage intake was estimated using grazing exclosure cages. Herbage consumed during summer period was on average 211 g DM m- 2 and the pasture utilization was 55 %. The annual consumption and utilization was 336 g DM m- 2 and 62 % in the grazed treatments and 28 g DM m- 2 and 15 % in the control, respectively. Total annual pasture production was on average 72 % higher in the grazed treatments compared to the control. T ere was no diff€erence between the grazed treatments on annual production, herbage intake or pasture utilization. Grazing stimulated herbage production, and such abandoned grasslands are valuable forage resources...|$|E
30|$|Land use/land cover {{change can}} affect the {{ecological}} processes of an area such as hydrological cycle. The change in the condition of water resources of an area {{could be a good}} indicator of changes in ecosystem function as a result of altered land use/land cover. Eucalyptus expansion in central Ethiopia is one of the recent land use/land cover changes causing controversy on its potential ecological effect. This study was designed to evaluate effects of three adjacent land uses/land covers, i.e. <b>cultivated</b> land, <b>grassland</b> and Eucalyptus woodlot on surface runoff in Meja River watershed, central Ethiopia.|$|R

By the aid of SoilCan‐lysimeters, an ideal network was built between the four different TERENO‐observatories with their highly instrumented test sites. Within the four TERENO‐observatories at 13 different experimental sites, in total 126 lysimeters were filled monolithically and the measurements were started in October 2010. The lysimeters have been <b>cultivated</b> as <b>grassland</b> or arable land with a standardized crop rotation: winter wheat – winter barley – winter rye – oat...|$|R

About 2484, 513, 110 and 16  ha of grassland were also reverted to cultivated land, shrubland, built-up area and forest, respectively. An estimated 575, 297, 12  ha of forest were also converted to shrubland, <b>cultivated</b> land and <b>grassland,</b> respectively. Similarly, shrubland, grassland and forest were also gained from other LU/LC categories (Table  8). In these periods, a significant area of cultivated land {{were converted}} from shrubland (4598  ha), grassland (2484  ha), forest (297  ha) and built-up area (9  ha). In reverse, {{there was also a}} considerable conversion of cultivated land to other categories. A significant amount of gains and losses in built-up area was also occurred in these periods (Table 8).|$|R
