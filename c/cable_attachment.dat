2500|$|Some {{references}} {{also use}} the term pedrail. The issue is further confused by Bottrill referring to his design as [...] "ped-rail shoes". [...] The two concepts are similar in that they attempt to improve cross-country performance by spreading out the load on a flat surface. The difference is primarily in how the pads are connected; the dreadnaught wheel connects the pads {{to each other and}} ride along the wheel, whereas in the pedal arrangement, introduced in 1903, each pad is connected to a pivot on the wheel itself, and there are no inter-pad connections. Some pedrail systems also include internal suspensions to improve their performance over rough ground. Bottrill's design spans the definition, as its <b>cable</b> <b>attachments</b> are similar to the pedrail connections, albeit much more simple.|$|R
40|$|In our {{previous}} paper [1], we examined enhancing manipulation capabilities of cable robots by addition of base mobility to the spooling-winches. Base mobility facilitated {{the regulation of}} the tension-direction (via active repositioning of the mobile bases) and allowed for better conditioning of the wrench feasible workspace. In this paper, we explore design-modifications on the attachment to the common payload (merging multiple <b>cables,</b> <b>attachment</b> via pulleys) as alternate means to improve quality of the wrench-feasible workspace. Specifically we systematically examine {{the role played by}} attachment-modality and location, focusing on the benefits/drawbacks of the ensuing natural mechanical averaging behavior. Further, by using the notion of virtual cable subsystems, we illustrate the subsumption of this case into {{our previous}} mobile-cable-robot analysis framework. We seek improvement of the overall tension distribution by utilizing configuration space redundancy to shape the tension null-space. This is implemented computationally within the framework of a Tension Factor optimization problem over the workspace and explored via both simulation and experiments. ...|$|R

40|$|Rigid link {{manipulators}} (RLMs) {{are used}} in industry to move and manipulate objects in their workspaces. Flexible link manipulators (FLMs), which are much lighter and hence highly flexible compared to RLMs, have been proposed {{in the past as}} means to reduce energy consumption and increase the speed of operation. Unlike RLM, an FLM has infinite degrees of freedom actuated by finite number of actuators. Due to high flexibility affecting the precision of operation, special control algorithms are required to make them usable. Recently, a method to stiffen FLMs using cables, without adding significant inertia or adversely affecting the advantages of FLMs, has been proposed as a possible solution in a preliminary work by the authors. An FLM stiffened using cables can use existing control algorithms designed for RLMs. In this paper we discuss in detail the working principle and limitations of cable stiffening for flexible link manipulators through simulations and experiments. A systematic way of deciding the location of <b>cable</b> <b>attachments</b> to the FLM is also presented. The main result {{of this paper is to}} show the advantage of adding a second pair of cables in reducing overall link deflections...|$|R

5000|$|Washington, D.C. {{had a large}} {{network of}} conduit lines, to avoid wires. Some lines used {{overhead}} wires when they approached rural or suburban areas. The last such line ran to Cabin John, Maryland. The current collector [...] "plow" [...] was mounted underneath the car on a fitting just forward of the rear truck on PCC streetcars. It had two cables with female connectors on cables to attach to matching cables of the car's electrical system. A [...] "plowman" [...] was assigned at each changeover point from overhead trolley wire to conduit to remove the <b>cable</b> <b>attachments</b> {{to the car and}} stow the plow, which did not remain with the car and was reattached in an incoming car running on overhead wire. The lower section of the plow [...] "board" [...] was drawn by the moving car within the cavity of the conduit. Because of this usage, many of Washington's streetcars carried trolley poles, which were lowered while operating in {{the central part of the}} city; when the cars reached a point where they switched to overhead operation, they stopped over a plow pit where the conduit plows were detached and the trolley poles raised, the reverse operation taking place on inbound runs.

50|$|Three to {{five percent}} of the new mines dropped into the North Sea detonated as soon as the salt pellets dissolved; and hydrophones {{detected}} premature detonations continuing for a week after minelaying. These premature detonations were initially attributed to activation of the horn fuze detonation circuits by seawater leaking into the mines; and mine spacing was increased from 250 ft on the first minelaying excursion to 300 ft on subsequent excursions to minimize leakage caused by detonation of nearby mines. About one percent of the mines deployed during the first excursion broke free of their mooring cables and washed ashore in Norway within a month. Mines used for the last eleven excursions had springs installed at the mine mooring <b>cable</b> <b>attachment</b> points to buffer wave loading during storms. Premature detonations increased to 14 percent for the fourth minelaying excursion; because some mines had been assembled with the more sensitive antenna fuze relay settings made by the Bureau of Ordnance. The fifth minelaying excursion was halted when 19 percent of the mines detonated prematurely. San Francisco identified relay armature sensitivity as a major cause of premature detonations during a comparative field test minelaying excursion on August 12. Subsequent investigations revealed copper sulfate deposits caused by antenna corrosion created a weak battery increasing the probability of relay activation by shock wave accelerations when nearby mines detonated. Premature detonations dropped to four to six percent when sensitivity was adjusted to 30 to 45 millivolts for mines deployed by the last five minelaying excursions.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{clinically}} examine the relationship between rotator cable integrity and the presence of pseudoparalysis. A retrospective review was performed of a consecutive series of arthroscopic repairs of massive rotator cuff tears performed between January 2007 and June 2009. A total of 127 massive tears were identified. Group 1 comprised 24 patients with preoperative pseudoparalysis. Group 2 comprised 97 patients (103 repairs) with active forward flexion more than 90 °. In group I, no patient maintained integrity of both rotator cable attachments; 1 rotator <b>cable</b> <b>attachment</b> was disrupted in 45. 8 % of cases; and both rotator cable attachments were disrupted in 54. 2 % of cases. In group II, both rotator cable attachments were intact in 22. 3 % of cases; 1 rotator <b>cable</b> <b>attachment</b> was disrupted in 62. 1 % of cases; and both rotator cable attachments were disrupted in 15. 5 % of cases. The difference in the distribution of cable attachments between the 2 groups was statistically significant (P<. 001). Overall, preoperative pseudoparalysis predicted a disruption of both rotator cables with 88. 8 % specificity, 44. 8 % sensitivity, and 77. 8 % accuracy. Pseudoparalysis requires the disruption of at least 1 rotator <b>cable</b> <b>attachment.</b> This study reinforces the concept of rotator cable integrity and the ability of patients to maintain forward flexion above shoulder level and highlights the importance of reinforcing the rotator cable attachments in the repair of massive rotator cuff tears...|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} contribution to knowledge made by this research work is demonstrating {{the benefits of}} differentially fed balanced transmit antenna in modern communication system. Extensive experimental studies have established {{the fact that a}} true differential amplifier feeding a balanced antenna offers higher linearity and lower distortions compared to the single ended feeding technique, even while using the same amplifier. With continuing advancements in personal communications in this era of digital economy, the demand for wireless connectivity has grown radically, resulting in stringent performance requirement for RF components. Differential circuits are preferred choice in RFIC design due to its good noise immunity and low distortion characteristics. But it is observed that single ended PAs and LNAs are used for the feeding part because of the antenna industry’s tendency to stick to conventional 50 Ω interface. Therefore, differentially fed transmit balanced antenna is an area of current research, which has been studied in this thesis. The study was set out with a review of the state-of-the-art in active integrated antennas. Following that, the ground plane influence on antenna radiation pattern was explored and novel techniques to compensate the effects were presented. It was observed that the current flow in a coaxial cable also affects radiation pattern. Hence, a novel method was proposed to measure wireless devices in the anechoic chamber eradicating the need of any <b>cable</b> <b>attachments.</b> Broadband differential amplifiers were then reviewed with a view to feed balanced and unbalanced antennas for demonstrating the potential of differential feeding technique over the conventional one. The amplifier with differential output interface exhibited higher gain and linearity in both bench test and radiated power test. Further improvement in linearity was reported by lowering the output resistance of the amplifier. Afterwards, a broadband antenna with stable radiation pattern and impedance was designed to carry out radiated harmonic measurements, which illustrated that the fully differential output configuration possesses significantly lower harmonic distortion. All these measurement results have suggested that balanced antenna fed by differential amplifier can be the best solution for applications demanding higher output power, greater linearity and lower distortion. Therefore it is recommended to re-evaluate the idea of power amplifier and antenna interface in RF front-end designs...|$|R
