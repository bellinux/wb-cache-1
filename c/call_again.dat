5|$|Maintaining the {{services}} of the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company did, at times, take some {{effort on the part}} of the residents. For example, in Ulladulla a wooden jetty was built in 1859 in order to retain {{the services}} of the company; they had informed the farmers that their ships would not <b>call</b> <b>again</b> at Ulladulla unless better mooring facilities were provided. (After seven years the jetty was replaced by a stone pier built by the government on the natural reef). Similarly the town of Tathra was created through the erection of a small jetty, built so that the local farmers could gain access to coastal shipping which previously had stopped 25km away at Merimbula.|$|E
25|$|In July 2009, Gough {{revealed}} {{himself to}} be a supporter of the Conservative Party and offered his support to Nigel Adams' parliamentary campaign for Selby and Ainsty. He was invited by David Cameron to be the Conservative Party candidate in the Barnsley Central by-election in February 2011, but declined due to other commitments. Initially Gough thought the invitation was a hoax and put the phone down. Cameron had to <b>call</b> <b>again</b> to confirm the invitation was genuine. Gough turned down the invitation, but made himself available to support the Tories during the by-election campaign.|$|E
25|$|The {{captaincy}} {{was given}} back to him, briefly, in August 1975 when Roy Virgin's reign ended after three months. Watts promptly broke a finger and Mushtaq inherited the job. But {{he received the}} <b>call</b> <b>again</b> {{at the end of}} 1977 with the club in turmoil as the committee crossed swords with several key players, including the outgoing captain. At the subsequent Extraordinary General meeting, held just before Christmas, Watts took his place on the platform to face the members, some of whom had formed themselves into an Action Group to demand, at the very least, a full explanation of all the behind-the-scenes machinations. The next two summers saw his Northamptonshire team reach the Gillette Cup final, win the Benson & Hedges Cup (with Watts' tactical acumen seen to best advantage in an absorbing semi-final struggle against Mike Brearley's Middlesex at Lord's), and drag itself off the bottom of the Championship table.|$|E

500|$|Like other rails, {{this species}} {{has a wide}} range of vocalisations. The male's {{territorial}} and advertising call is a series of rapid grating krrr notes repeated {{two or three times a}} second for several minutes. It is given most often in the breeding season, usually early or late in the day, but sometimes continues after dark or starts before dawn. The male stands upright with his neck extended when advertising, but will also call when chasing intruders on the ground or in flight. Both sexes give a sharp, loud kip call as an alarm or during territorial interactions, adapting a similar pose as for the advertising call. Once breeding starts, the birds become much quieter, but territorial birds commence the kip <b>call</b> <b>again</b> during the non-breeding season, especially when there is a high density of African crakes in the area. A wheezy kraaa is associated with threat displays and copulation; imitation of this call by a human can bring a rail to within [...] Newly hatched chicks make a soft wheeeez call, and older chicks cheep.|$|E
