40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} local multiscale model reduction for problems with multiple scales {{in space and}} time. We developed our approaches {{within the framework of}} the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) using space-time <b>coarse</b> <b>cells.</b> The main idea of GMsFEM is to construct a local snapshot space and a local spectral decomposition in the snapshot space. Previous research in developing multiscale spaces within GMsFEM focused on constructing multiscale spaces and relevant ingredients in space only. In this paper, our main objective is to develop a multiscale model reduction framework within GMsFEM that uses space-time <b>coarse</b> <b>cells.</b> We construct space-time snapshot and offline spaces. We compute these snapshot solutions by solving local problems. A complete snapshot space will use all possible boundary conditions; however, this can be very expensive. We propose using randomized boundary conditions and oversampling. We construct the local spectral decomposition based on our analysis, as presented in the paper. We present numerical results to confirm our theoretical findings and to show that using our proposed approaches, we can obtain an accurate solution with low dimensional coarse spaces. We remark that the proposed method is a significant extension compared to existing methods, which use <b>coarse</b> <b>cells</b> in space only because of (1) the parabolic nature of cell solutions, (2) extra degrees of freedom associated with space-time cells, and (3) local boundary conditions in space-time cells...|$|E
40|$|Simplified {{chemical}} kinetic schemes are {{a crucial}} prerequisite for the simulation of complex threedimensional turbulent flows, and various methods for {{the generation of}} reduced mechanisms have been developed in the past. The method of intrinsic low-dimensional manifolds (ILDM), e. g., provides a mathematical tool for the automatic simplification of chemical kinetics, but one problem of this method {{is the fact that}} the information which comes out of the mechanism reduction procedure has to be stored for subsequent use in reacting flow calculations. In most cases tabulation procedures are used which store the relevant data (such as reduced reaction rates) in terms of the reaction progress variables followed by table look-up during the reacting flow calculations. This can result in huge amounts of storage needed for the multi-dimensional tabulation. In order to overcome this problem we present a storage scheme which is based on orthogonal polynomials. Instead of using small tabulation cells and local mesh refinement, the thermochemical state space is divided into a small number of <b>coarse</b> <b>cells.</b> Within these <b>coarse</b> <b>cells</b> polynomial approximations are used instead of frequently used multi-linear interpolation.

40|$|Recently, a novel {{diffuse source}} (DS) {{upscaling}} method {{has been successfully}} applied for the upscaling of US tight gas reservoir model. However, this approach does not work {{very well in the}} conventional SPE 10 waterflood reservoir model. Therefore, in this work, the goal is to figure out why this approach does not work in another model and how to improve this DS upscaling algorithm. Detailed analysis shows that there are three issues that need to be resolved for a more robust algorithm. The first issue is about the specification of the diffuse source time that is needed to define the transient state diffuse source in the fine cell. In the previous work, the time selection rule is not clearly stated. Too small or too large time values can lead to an overestimated or underestimated upscaling result. In this study, I find that the diffuse source time can be correlated with the fine cell diffusive time of flight (DTOF). By means of a series of sensitivity test, I get the conclusion that we can use the pore volume weighted average of the DTOF square to determine the diffuse source time. The second issue is related to the calculation of the effective transmissibility. In the case of upscaling the homogenous model, the previous proposed effective transmissibility calculation method gives us a wrong result. In this study, by studying the internal pressure profile in the <b>coarse</b> <b>cells,</b> I propose to use the fine cell pressures immediately adjacent to the coarse cell interface to determine an effective face permeability and apply the effective permeability to the calculation of steady state transmissibility in the simulator. The effective transmissibility obtained from this method is correct when the model is homogenous. The third issue {{has to do with the}} no flow boundary condition used in the local upscaling. In upscaling, we often encounter such problem that the no flow boundary condition is a bad approximation and to improve the accuracy of the result, we need to consider the existence of boundary effect. In this study, I generalize the DS upscaling algorithm by adding a buffering region around the upscaling <b>coarse</b> <b>cells</b> to reduce the impact of unrealistic boundary condition on the inter-cell effective transmissibility calculation. The buffering region is determined according to the fine cell DTOF in the target <b>coarse</b> <b>cells</b> and by using the exponential function in the diffuse source term, I propose a cut-off criterion to exclude the cells that are not necessary for upscaling. Based on all the analysis above, I applied an improved upscaling algorithm for the upscaling of the SPE 10 model. It turns out that the simulation results from the new upscaled model have a good match with the fine scale results, which gives us the confidence on this improved algorithm...|$|E

40|$|In many {{application}} areas, {{particularly in}} the biological sciences, there {{is the need to}} store several values of variables. Given a finite precison, one can store these values in Nk explicit cells, refered to as value cells, in a k-dimensional space of grain N. Typically, the number of values that must be stored is a very small fraction of the total number specified by the grain of the multidimensional space. This leads to data structuring that reduces the number of explicit cells required for a given level of accuracy.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{upscaling}} fine scale permeability fields to general quadrilateral-shaped <b>coarse</b> <b>cells</b> is presented.

The general level of accuracy of the technique is demonstrated through application to a number of flow problems. The real strength of the conforming scale up method is demonstrated when the method is applied in conjunction with a flow-based gridding technique. In this case, the approach is shown to provide results that are significantly more accurate than those obtained using standard techniques...|$|E

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{approach}} of wall modeling via function enrichment to detached-eddy simulation. The wall model aims at using <b>coarse</b> <b>cells</b> in the near-wall region by modeling the velocity profile in the viscous sublayer and log-layer.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{computational}} cost of the simulation of electromagnetic responses in geophysical settings that involve highly heterogeneous media, we develop a multiscale finite volume method with oversampling for the quasi-static Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain. We assume a coarse mesh nested within a fine mesh that accurately discretizes the problem. For each <b>coarse</b> <b>cell,</b> we independently solve a local version of the original Maxwell's system subject to linear boundary conditions on an extended domain, which includes the <b>coarse</b> <b>cell</b> and a neighborhood of fine cells around it. The local Maxwell's system is solved using the fine mesh contained in the extended domain and the mimetic finite volume method. Next, these local solutions (basis functions) together with a weak-continuity condition are used to construct a coarse-mesh version of the global problem. The basis functions can be used to obtain the fine-mesh details from the solution of the coarse-mesh problem. Our approach leads to a significant reduction {{in the size of the}} final system of equations and the computational time, while accurately approximating the behavior of the fine-mesh solutions. We demonstrate the performance of our method using a synthetic 3 D example of a mineral deposit. Comment: 15 pages, 18 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The MultiScale Finite Volume (MSFV) {{method is}} known to produce non-monotone {{solutions}}. The causes of the non-monotone solutions are identified and connected to the local flux across the boundaries of primal <b>coarse</b> <b>cells</b> induced by the basis functions.

40|$|The {{availability}} of high-resolution topographic data enables the modeling of urban floods {{with a high}} level of accuracy. However, such a modelling has a poor computational efficiency. Subgrid models enable to decrease the computational time by using <b>coarse</b> <b>cells</b> while preserving information from the detailed topographic data to some degree. In particular, shallow-water models with porosity constitute a subgrid model well-adapted for urban flood modeling. In this article, a new set of fully dynamic shallow-water equations with depth-dependent porosities is presented. Then, the implementation of the model is detailed and preliminary results obtained for a theoretical two-dimensional urban area are analyzed.

40|$|Many {{engineering}} and scientific applications deal with models that have multiple spatial scales, and these scales can be non-separable. Many {{of these processes}} can exhibit nonlinearities and have a tight coupling with the temporal scales. Because of the scale disparity, modeling these processes in the fine-scale approaches often {{involves the use of}} a large number of degrees of freedom, and thus can be prohibitively expensive. As such, some efficient model reduction methods are required to handle the multiscale problems. In the dissertation, we are solving multiscale nonlinear problems and time-dependent problems. Existing methods to solve these problems include numerical homogenization, multiscale finite element methods, heterogeneous multiscale methods, and the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Methods (GMsFEM). GMsFEM approaches propose a systematic enrichment, which calculates multiscale basis functions via local spectral decomposition in each coarse cell. We first propose a multiscale model reduction framework within GMsFEM for nonlinear elliptic problems. We consider an exemplary problem, which consists of nonlinear p-Laplacian with heterogeneous coefficients. The main challenging feature of this problem is that local subgrid models are nonlinear involving the gradient of the solution. Our novel work includes re-casting the multiscale model reduction problem onto the boundaries of <b>coarse</b> <b>cells,</b> and introducing nonlinear eigenvalue problems in the snapshot space for these nonlinear ?harmonic? functions. We also present convergence analysis and numerical results, which show that our approaches can recover the fine-scale solution with a few degrees of freedom. The proposed methods can, in general, be used for more general nonlinear problems, where one needs nonlinear local spectral decomposition. We next consider solving problems with multiple scales in space and time. We develop our approaches within the frameworks of GMsFEM and Generalized Multiscale Discontinuous Galerkin Methods (GMsDGM), separately, using space-time <b>coarse</b> <b>cells.</b> Previous research in developing multiscale spaces within GMsFEM or GMsDGM mainly considered spatial multiscale spaces and relevant ingredients only, which will usually lead to very high dimensional models.

We also discuss adding the online stage, where we make use of the online residual information to construct online basis functions. Numerical results are presented to verify the theoretical findings and to show that using our proposed approaches, we can obtain an accurate solution with low dimensional coarse spaces...|$|E

40|$|Metric {{resolution}} digital terrain models (DTMs) {{of rivers}} now {{make it possible}} for multi-dimensional fluid mechanics models to be applied to characterize flow at fine scales that are relevant to studies of river morphology and ecological habitat, or microscales. These developments are important for managing rivers because of the potential to better understand system dynamics, anthropogenic impacts, and the consequences of proposed interventions. However, the data volumes and computational demands of microscale river modeling have largely constrained applications to small multiples of the channel width, or the mesoscale. This report presents computational methods to extend a microscale river model beyond the mesoscale to the macroscale, defined as large multiples of the channel width. A method of automated unstructured grid generation is presented that automatically clusters fine resolution cells in areas of curvature (e. g., channel banks), and places relatively <b>coarse</b> <b>cells</b> in areas lacking topographic variability. This overcomes the need to manually generate breaklines to constrain the grid, which is painstaking at the mesoscale and virtually impossible at the macroscale.

The sensitivity of model output to grid design and resistance parameters is also examined as it relates to analysis of hydrology, hydraulic geometry and river habitats and the findings reiterate the importance of model calibration and validation...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a novel reduced-order multi-scale method for solving large time-domain wavefield simulation problems. Our algorithm {{consists of two}} main stages. During the first "off-line" stage the fine-grid operator (of the graph Laplacian type} is partitioned on <b>coarse</b> <b>cells</b> (subdomains). Then projection-type multi-scale reduced order models (ROMs) are computed for the coarse cell operators. The off-line stage is embarrassingly parallel as ROM computations for the subdomains are independent of each other. It also {{does not depend on}} the number of simulated sources (inputs) and it is performed just once before the entire time-domain simulation. At the second "on-line" stage the time-domain simulation is performed within the obtained multi-scale ROM framework. The crucial feature of our formulation is the representation of the ROMs in terms of matrix Stieltjes continued fractions (S-fractions). The layered structure of the S-fraction introduces several hidden layers in the ROM representation, that results in the block-tridiagonal dynamic system within each coarse cell. This allows us to sparsify the obtained multi-scale subdomain operator ROMs and to reduce the communications between the adjacent subdomains which is highly beneficial for a parallel implementation of the on-line stage. Our approach suits perfectly the high performance computing architectures, however in this paper we present rather promising numerical results for a serial computing implementation only. These results include 3 D acoustic and multi-phase anisotropic elastic problems. Comment: 31 pages, 11 figure...|$|E

Therefore, {{reducing the number of}} grid cells, and in turn averaging reservoir properties within them, is desirable in order to make running simulations more feasible. Averaging reservoir properties within the <b>coarse</b> <b>cells</b> is usually referred to as upscaling, which can be achieved using different methods. Many upscaling techniques have been introduced in the literature. However, developing a practical and robust upscaling method has been a research topic for a long time. In this thesis, some of the upscaling methods, their application and limitations are presented. Special attention is given to two phase upscaling methods as they are within the scope of this project. Afterwards, a new two phase upscaling method, called Transmissibility Weighted Relative permeabilities (TWR), is proposed to upscale relative permeability curves in heterogeneous reservoirs.

The TWR method and the well pseudos were tested using synthetic 2 D and 3 D water flood models for different conditions in order to check the method’s performance. The results showed that the upscaled relative permeability curves (pseudo functions) succeeded in compensating for sub-grid heterogeneity and numerical dispersion so that the coarse models reproduced the fine models results. In order to make the use of the pseudo functions feasible in practice, a new method to group them, based on curve fitting of Chierici (1984) functional models, was introduced.

A fine mesh with cell dimensions {{in the range of}} 10  nm was defined in the heating center while <b>coarser</b> mesh <b>cells</b> with dimensions of about 1  μm were placed at the outer boundaries. By means of mesh sensitivity tests, it was assured that the maximum discretization error in the computed temperatures were well below 1  K.|$|R
40|$|Al alloy AlSi 10 Mg {{processed}} by Selective Laser Melting displays {{a very fine}} cellular eutetic microstructure (melt pool fine, MP fine) due to fast cooling rate from the melt. Such microstructural refinement results in high tensile strength and hardness. Studies have shown that a <b>coarser</b> <b>cells</b> region (melt pool coarse, MP coarse) {{as well as a}} heat affected zone (HAZ) can be observed at the melt pool boundary caused by a change of thermal history [1]. Those microstructural inhomogeneities act like a weak zone as demonstrated by the laser tracks observed on fracture features after tensile test [2]. This study aims at investigating in which zone fracture occurs. To do so, MP fine, MP coarse and HAZ were analyzed. Si precipitates spacing was compared with dimples size observed on fracture features. The Si precipitates fraction were quantified by image analysis. Hardness tests were performed in the 3 different zones by nanoindentation. [1] Thijs et al., Acta Mater. 61 (2013) pp. 1809 - 1819 [2] Tang et al., JOM 69 (2017) pp. 516 - 52...|$|R
40|$|A multigrid {{procedure}} that {{makes use of}} coarse grids generated by the agglomeration of control volumes is advocated as a practical approach for solving the threedimensional Euler equations on unstructured grids about complex configurations. It is shown that the agglomeration procedure can be tailored to achieve certain coarse grid properties such as the sizes of the coarse grids and aspect ratios of the <b>coarse</b> grid <b>cells.</b> The agglomeration is done as a preprocessing step and runs in linear time...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{adaptive}} level set method for motion of high codimensional objects (e. g., curves in three dimensions). This method uses only two (or a few fixed) levels of meshes. A uniform coarse mesh is defined {{over the whole}} computational domain. Any <b>coarse</b> mesh <b>cell</b> that contains the moving object is further divided into a uniform fine mesh. The coarse-to-fine ratios in the mesh refinement can be adjusted to achieve optimal efficiency. Refinement and coarsening (removing the fine mesh within a <b>coarse</b> grid <b>cell)</b> are performed dynamically during the evolution. In this adaptive method, the computation is localized mostly near the moving objects; thus, the computational cost is significantly reduced compared with the uniform mesh over the whole domain with the same resolution. In this method, the level set equations can be solved on these uniform meshes of different levels directly using standard high-order numerical methods. This method is examined by numerical examples of moving curves and applications to dislocation dynamics simulations. This two-level adaptive method also provides a basis for using locally varying time stepping to further reduce the computational cost. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} known that an {{integration}} of 3 D/ 4 D seismic data in reservoir characterization and modelling workflows is a potentially powerful tool. One {{of the many}} reasons is that seismic data distinguishes itself with high lateral resolution compared to a <b>coarse</b> <b>cell</b> scale in flow simulation process. Conventionally, required time of computation constrains the scale of grid cell. This leads to a choice between time consuming fine scale grids and coarser grids with unsatisfactory representation of complex geological structures and of fluids flows. Furthermore, the link between geological model and the flow simulation model has more physical sense when using fine scale model. Hereby is presented a novel workflow developed for a turbidite channel reservoir with complex structural and stratigraphic architectures. The workflow starts with the new algorithm of petrophysical inversion based on petro-elastic model (PEM) which offers a high quality distribution of static properties. Then the fine scale seismic lateral details allow locating small and meaningful connections/barriers within a reservoir. As soon as small heterogeneities are properly preserved and transferred into the dynamic model, the benefit appears in significant reduction of history matching phase. Finally, a validation of dynamic model and a history matching process are assisted by incorporation of time-lapse seismic data...|$|R
