40|$|As part {{of their}} {{corporate}} social responsibility, many organizations practice cause-related marketing, in which organizations donate to a chosen <b>cause</b> with every consumer purchase. The extant literature has identified {{the importance of the}} fit between the organization {{and the nature of the}} <b>cause</b> in influencing corporate image, as well as the influence of a connection between the <b>cause</b> and consumer preferences on brand attitudes and brand choice. However, prior research has not addressed which <b>cause</b> composition most appeals to consumers or the impact of <b>cause</b> choice on corporate image. A between-subjects field experiment in the Netherlands examines the influence of three core <b>cause</b> attributes—cause type, <b>cause</b> scope, and <b>cause</b> acuteness—on consumers’ perceptions of corporate image. Furthermore, this experiment examines the extent to which consumer identification with the <b>cause</b> mediates the influence of the <b>cause</b> attributes on corporate image. The findings indicate that identification with the <b>cause</b> leads to more positive evaluations of marketing campaigns for <b>cause</b> type and <b>cause</b> scope. Also, however, our results uncover a negative direct relationship between <b>cause</b> scope and corporate image. <b>Cause</b> acuteness is only marginally influential in corporate image perceptions.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{propose a}} method of redistributing {{ill-defined}} <b>causes</b> of death (IDCD) based on the investigation of such <b>causes.</b> METHODS In 2010, {{an evaluation of the}} results of investigating the <b>causes</b> of death classified as IDCD in accordance with chapter 18 of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 10) by the Mortality Information System was performed. The redistribution coefficients were calculated according to the proportional distribution of ill-defined <b>causes</b> reclassified after investigation in any chapter of the ICD- 10, except for chapter 18, and used to redistribute the ill-defined <b>causes</b> not investigated and remaining by sex and age. The IDCD redistribution coefficient was compared with two usual methods of redistribution: a) Total redistribution coefficient, based on the proportional distribution of all the defined <b>causes</b> originally notified and b) Non-external redistribution coefficient, similar to the previous, but excluding external <b>causes.</b> RESULTS Of the 97, 314 deaths by ill-defined <b>causes</b> reported in 2010, 30. 3 % were investigated, and 65. 5 % of those were reclassified as defined <b>causes</b> after the investigation. Endocrine diseases, mental disorders, and maternal <b>causes</b> had a higher representation among the reclassified ill-defined <b>causes,</b> contrary to infectious diseases, neoplasms, and genitourinary diseases, with higher proportions among the defined <b>causes</b> reported. External <b>causes</b> represented 9. 3 % of the ill-defined <b>causes</b> reclassified. The correction of mortality rates by the total redistribution coefficient and non-external redistribution coefficient increased the magnitude of the rates by a relatively similar factor for most <b>causes,</b> contrary to the IDCD redistribution coefficient that corrected the different <b>causes</b> of death with differentiated weights. CONCLUSIONS The proportional distribution of <b>causes</b> among the ill-defined <b>causes</b> reclassified after investigation was not similar to the original distribution of defined <b>causes.</b> Therefore, the redistribution of the remaining ill-defined <b>causes</b> based on the investigation allows for more appropriate estimates of the mortality risk due to specific <b>causes...</b>|$|R
