25|$|The {{landing gear}} is of a {{tricycle}} configuration {{with all three}} wheels mounted on steel sprung gear legs. The nosewheel is free <b>castering</b> and the aircraft is steered with differential braking. The brakes are mounted conventionally on the rudder pedal toes.|$|E
25|$|The {{tail fin}} is of wood {{construction}} and features a NACA 0012 symmetrical airfoil. The {{main landing gear}} legs are made from fibreglass laminates and mount wheels with hydraulically operated toe-brakes. The nose wheel is of a fully <b>castering</b> design and can rotate 360°, allowing the aircraft to be pushed backwards while ground handling.|$|E
5000|$|Mount: <b>Casters</b> {{mount to}} {{equipment}} or carts in three common manners. A <b>caster</b> top plate allows the <b>caster</b> to be {{bolted to the}} underside of the equipment. A <b>caster</b> stem may screw into place or ‘snap’ into place. <b>Casters</b> may also have a bracket allowing the <b>caster</b> to be mounted to vertical panels.|$|R
2500|$|Swivel <b>casters</b> are {{commonly}} used on smaller wagons because of the flexible, [...] mobility they offer. As the number of swivel <b>casters</b> attached to a wagon increases, though, it becomes increasingly difficult to align them. Consequently, {{it may be difficult}} or impossible to move a wagon that has a large number of swivel <b>casters</b> when the <b>casters</b> are unaligned. As a result, rigid <b>casters</b> are preferred for larger wagons, which typically require a proportionally higher number of <b>casters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The key {{dimensions}} {{to consider when}} determining the proper type of <b>caster</b> and <b>caster</b> size for {{a particular type of}} equipment and application are its overall height, swivel radius, and swivel offset (see <b>Caster</b> Dimensions diagram). The key elements of a <b>caster</b> include the following: ...|$|R
25|$|The Katana {{has several}} {{distinctive}} features, including its all-composite construction, low-mounted wing, T-tail arrangement, and a <b>castering</b> nosewheel. All models {{make use of}} a composite airframe which is constructed of glass- and carbon-fiber reinforced plastic. The one-piece fuselage has removable wings, which assists with transportation and servicing activities. The wings themselves have transparent plexiglas panels present so that key control elements can be readily inspected without disassembly. The airframe is complete with a sleek finish across the entirety of its exterior, which serves to eliminate corrosion and rivets in order to lower maintenance requirements. The maintenance costs of the Katana have been considered to be relatively low.|$|E
25|$|The Spitfires {{with the}} {{single-stage}} Merlin engines used four different wing types, Type A, B, C and D wings, {{which had the}} same dimensions and plan but different internal arrangements of armament and fuel tanks. All Mk Is, IIs, and Vs and their derivatives had small, rectangular undercarriage indicator pins which projected at an angle from the upper wing surfaces when the undercarriage legs were locked down, providing a positive mechanical indication that the landing gears were indeed down and locked, since the pilot {{could not see the}} landing gear for himself. These were a backup to the indicator lights on the instrument panel, in case the lights malfunctioned or failed. All of these variants used Dunlop AH2061 tyres, mounted on alloy mainwheels which had five openings. The fixed, <b>castering</b> tailwheels used Dunlop AH2184 tyres.|$|E

50|$|<b>Casters</b> {{are also}} stopped {{completely}} using <b>caster</b> cups.|$|R
50|$|This {{style of}} <b>caster</b> only allows forward and {{backward}} movement. Rigid <b>casters</b> tend to be stronger than swivel <b>casters.</b> They are rated at the same capacity as the swivel <b>casters</b> for safety reasons. They can be a one piece construction or a two piece construction that is riveted or welded.|$|R

2500|$|Like its predecessor, it had {{the engine}} mounted {{directly}} in front of the leading edge of the wing and the main undercarriage was also like that of the Type VIII, with the wheels [...] mounted in <b>castering</b> trailing arms which could slide up and down steel tubes, the movement being sprung by bungee cords. This simple and ingenious design allowed crosswind landings with less risk of damage. A sprung tailwheel was fitted to the rear fuselage in front of the tailplane, with a similar <b>castering</b> arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|Another form of control, {{which is}} less common now than it once was, is to steer using [...] "differential braking", in which the {{tailwheel}} is a simple, freely <b>castering</b> mechanism, and the aircraft is steered by applying brakes {{to one of the}} main wheels in order to turn in that direction. [...] This is also used on some tricycle gear aircraft, with the nose wheel being the freely <b>castering</b> wheel instead. Like the steerable tailwheel/skid, it is usually integrated with the rudder pedals on the craft to allow an easy transition between wheeled and aerodynamic control.|$|E
2500|$|Air <b>casters</b> are {{sometimes}} used {{in place of}} rolling <b>casters.</b> These require pressurized air to operate, which produces audible hiss that is undesirable in some situations, and are typically more expensive than rolling <b>casters,</b> but they {{have the advantage of}} [...] "locking" [...] the scenery securely in place when depressurized and, like swivel <b>casters,</b> they permit omnidirectional movement.|$|R
50|$|<b>Casters</b> {{comprise}} {{two major}} categories: a swivel <b>caster</b> pivots around a kingpin, so it rotates {{as well as}} rolls, while a rigid <b>caster</b> has its wheel mounted in a fixed frame, or rig, and only rolls.|$|R
5000|$|Swivel head: A rigid <b>caster</b> allows single {{back and}} forth direction. A swivel <b>caster</b> allows for 360 degree {{directional}} movement. The swivel action of a <b>caster</b> depends on bearings and lubrication. Bearing designs include ball bearings and raceway bearings. Grease fittings serve to inject grease into the axles, <b>caster</b> raceways and wheels. Grease fittings may also be known as [...] "zerks." ...|$|R
2500|$|The SR22, {{certified}} in November 2000, {{is a more}} powerful version of the earlier SR20. The SR22 is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of composite construction, featuring fixed (non-retractable) tricycle landing gear with a <b>castering</b> nose wheel and steering via differential braking on the main wheels. It {{is powered by a}} nose-mounted 310hp (231kW) Continental IO-550-N [...] piston engine. The four-seat cabin is accessed through doors {{on either side of the}} fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The Cessna 162's {{design has}} evolved {{considerably}} {{from the first}} prototype, including the wing position and tail configuration. The high-wing monoplane has fixed tricycle landing gear, with a <b>castering</b> nosewheel. [...] The wingspan is [...] and internal cabin width is [...] at shoulder height. The doors are different from previous two-seat Cessna models in that they open by swinging upward. The controls are unusual for a Cessna in that they have single-hand panel-mounted yokes {{instead of the usual}} two-hand panel-mounted yokes.|$|E

5000|$|Magic can be {{performed}} in Erfworld by units called <b>casters.</b> Each <b>caster</b> has a specialty in one of twenty-four magical disciplines, but can theoretically cast in any discipline. These specialties can be combined by mentally linking <b>casters</b> together using the magical discipline of [...] "thinkamancy"- a process that increases magical power but sometimes harms the <b>casters</b> involved when their link is broken.|$|R
25|$|Various <b>caster</b> {{types are}} used on scenery wagons. The choice of <b>caster</b> type for any {{particular}} wagon {{depends on a}} number of factors, including platform size and shape, scenery weight, production aesthetics and budget. Typically, <b>casters</b> are mounted so that the bottom of the platform is elevated approximately one-half to three-quarters of an inch above the stage. The number of <b>casters</b> required for a wagon depends on <b>caster</b> type and load rating as well as the size, shape and weight of the wagon and scenery.|$|R

50|$|<b>Casters</b> {{are widely}} used in the medical {{industry}} for applications such as hospital beds, equipment carts, surgical tables, and IV poles. Medical <b>casters</b> must tolerate exposure to the various cleaning and disinfectant fluids used in hospitals. Hospital beds and stretchers are typically equipped with a central <b>caster</b> locking system that allow all <b>casters</b> to be simultaneously locked by one person. Medical equipment <b>casters</b> must often have high load capacities, with low profiles and swivel resistance, to accommodate high patient or equipment weight while providing ease of operation over different floor types and through tight spaces.|$|R

50|$|The {{undercarriage}} {{consists of}} two wheels mounted on struts, with long skids which extended rearwards removing {{the need for a}} tail-skid. A feature of the undercarriage requested by the French customer was <b>castering</b> main-wheels allowing cross-wind landings.|$|E
50|$|On August 22, 2007, Sam <b>Caster</b> {{resigned}} as CEO of Mannatech. On October 19, 2007, {{it was reported}} that the company had fired Grant Thornton LLP as its auditor after the accounting firm demanded that Mannatech remove Sam <b>Caster</b> from all responsibilities. Sam <b>Caster</b> was barred by the attorney general of Texas from serving as a director, officer, or employee of Mannatech for five years—from February 2009 until February 2014. <b>Caster</b> was also barred from taking a role in any other multi-level marketing programs during that time. Despite this, then-CEO Wayne Badovinus stated <b>Caster</b> would work as a consultant answering directly to him. The attorney general's office agreed <b>Caster</b> could serve as an outside consultant to the company.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Caster's</b> father, Ira <b>Caster,</b> was {{employed}} by the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department and became the chief criminal deputy in the 1930s. [...] <b>Caster</b> also worked as a deputy sheriff for the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department in the off-season during his professional baseball career.|$|R
50|$|To {{ensure the}} design {{integrity}} of <b>casters,</b> the Institute of <b>Caster</b> and Wheel Manufacturers (ICWM) working {{in collaboration with}} the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has developed the ANSI ICWM: 2012 The ICWM Performance Standard for <b>Casters</b> and Wheels which is intended to provide manufacturers, specifiers and users with a common basis for evaluating the safety, durability, structural adequacy and technical requirements for group specific <b>casters</b> and wheels.|$|R
