It promoted discussions about Polish independence, questioned the efficiency of the state <b>controlled</b> <b>economy,</b> and government disdain and even persecution of veterans of the Polish Armed Forces in the West and the Armia Krajowa resistance during World War II. While the intelligentsia expressed their dissatisfaction with discussions and publications (bibuła), workers took to the streets. The living conditions in Poland did not improve, contrary to government propaganda, and workers increasingly found that they had little power compared to bureaucracy of the Party (nomenklatura).|$|E

In the special system of the so-called <b>controlled</b> <b>economy</b> under the Communist regimes, such status provided political and financial advantages that greatly helped the city continue its growth. The architect József Kerényi (1900–1975) adapted and renovated several historic buildings for other uses, helping keep the varied historical character of the city alive. For instance, in the early 1970s, he renovated the early eighteenth-century Franciscan monastery for use as the Zoltán Kodály Conservatory; it opened for classes in 1975.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{classical}} analysis of monetary adjustment under a {{fixed exchange rate}} to the open, agrarian, and heavily <b>controlled</b> <b>economies</b> of Sub-Saharan African during the 1970 s and 1980 s. When the central bank is illiquid, monetary adjustment takes place through changes in domestic credit rather than through payments imbalances; and if expenditure requirements are rigid, macroeconomic sustainability requires that the government exploit the revenue potential implicit in its controls. The automatic adjustment mechanism can break down if the government transfers the rents generated by its control regime to the private sector, or if it imposes price controls and fails to adjust them {{to a change in}} government spending. In the latter case, the cash economy can implode, as in Tanzania 1979 – 84. The analysis formalizes and extends arguments presented in Bevan et al.
