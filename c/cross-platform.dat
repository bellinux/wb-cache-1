5|$|Caltrain, which {{provides}} service between San Francisco, San Jose and Gilroy, has a <b>cross-platform</b> interchange at Millbrae.|$|E
5|$|Steam for OS X was {{originally}} planned for release in April 2010; it was launched worldwide on May 12, 2010, following a successful beta period. In {{addition to the}} Steam client, several features were made available to developers, allowing them {{to take advantage of}} the <b>cross-platform</b> Source engine, and platform and network capabilities using Steamworks. Through SteamPlay, the OS X client allows players who have purchased compatible products in the Windows version to download the Mac versions at no cost, allowing them to continue playing the game on the other platform. Some third-party titles may require the user to re-purchase them to gain access to the <b>cross-platform</b> functionality. The Steam Cloud is <b>cross-platform</b> compatible. Multiplayer games can also be cross-compatible, allowing Windows and Mac players to play with each other.|$|E
5|$|The side {{platforms}} of Grand Street station allegedly have {{walls that}} could easily be demolished for a <b>cross-platform</b> transfer with the Second Avenue Subway.|$|E
5|$|The Lexington Avenue–63rd Street {{subway station}} has two island platforms, which were {{originally}} built with now-demolished walls on their northern sides. The platforms {{were designed to}} provide a <b>cross-platform</b> interchange to the Second Avenue Subway.|$|E
5|$|The four {{tracks are}} served by two island platforms; {{northbound}} trains call at the western platform and southbound trains the eastern platform, providing <b>cross-platform</b> interchange between the two routes.|$|E
5|$|As of February 2014, SteamOS, Valve's own Linux-based {{operating}} system, supports Portal 2 and its predecessor, as do {{most modern}} Debian-based Linux distributions on its services via the Steam client. Released as a Beta in early 2014 for Linux distributions, it holds {{all of the}} same traits as the other versions, retaining <b>cross-platform</b> play, split screen and fully native controller support.|$|E
5|$|At Euston, major {{reconstruction}} {{works were}} undertaken {{to incorporate the}} new Victoria line platforms so that <b>cross-platform</b> interchanges could be provided with the Northern line's Bank branch—the former C route to King's Cross and Bank. Unlike the former CCE platforms, which were in separate tunnels with side platforms, the Bank branch tracks served an island platform in a single large tunnel. These platforms suffered from dangerous overcrowding at peak times. To provide <b>cross-platform</b> interchange, a new section of tunnel was constructed for northbound Bank branch trains, which were diverted to a new platform south of the original alignment. The redundant northbound track bed in the station tunnel was filled in to form a wider southbound platform. The new Victoria line platforms were excavated between and parallel to the original and the new Bank branch tunnels. Each pair of platforms was linked via a concourse served by escalators.|$|E
5|$|Online {{multiplayer}} mode has {{the same}} races and modes as single-player. The game features <b>cross-platform</b> online racing, allowing players of the PlayStation 3 version of Wipeout HD Fury to play the Fury tracks with the handheld console. The game also features downloadable content (DLC), with two separate DLCs offering twelve tracks and twelve ships each for cross-play.|$|E
5|$|Some {{parts of}} the {{standard}} library are covered by specifications (for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites (if supplied). However, {{because most of the}} standard library is <b>cross-platform</b> Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.|$|E
5|$|The Young Reporters Programme {{provides}} journalism {{students or}} those who have recently started their journalism careers a <b>cross-platform</b> journalist-training programme and on-the-job experience during the YOG. Young Reporters, {{between the ages of}} 18 and 24, are selected by the Continental Associations of National Olympic Committees and will represent each of the five continents.|$|E
5|$|The service hosted {{hundreds}} of thousands of players at its peak, {{and was one of the}} first <b>cross-platform</b> gaming services. It was shut down during the 2011 earthquake in Japan for twelve days. The platform was also subjected to denial of service attacks and players attempting to cheat who were subsequently banned.|$|E
5|$|Wipeout 2048 {{preserves}} {{some technical}} aspects of its predecessor Wipeout HD, including downloadable content, online multiplayer mode, and <b>cross-platform</b> play with PlayStation 3 owners of Wipeout HD. The game received mainly positive reviews. Critics agreed that its graphics and visuals showcased {{the power of the}} then-new PlayStation Vita, but criticised its long loading time and other technical issues.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{version of}} this version of You Don't Know Jack was {{released}} for iOS systems in April 2011. It featured twenty 10-question episodes, but was limited to a single-player mode. Jellyvision Games later pulled the application, in anticipation of release of a more robust client for both iOS and Android that will mimic the Facebook application, featuring <b>cross-platform</b> multiplayer between iOS, Android, and Facebook versions, and downloadable episodes from the Facebook game.|$|E
5|$|As {{they share}} many <b>cross-platform</b> games and {{compete for the}} same {{audience}} as their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The PS3 uses the Blu-ray format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard DVD9. The Xbox 360 is less expensive to produce, and analysts expect that a mid-revision will allow Microsoft to break-even on manufacturing costs, while industry consensus is that the Xbox 360's conventional architecture is easier to develop for.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Tools {{is a game}} engine {{created and}} used {{internally}} by the Japanese company Square Enix. It combines standard libraries for elements such as graphics, sound and artificial intelligence while providing game developers with various authoring tools. The target systems of Crystal Tools are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. This was decided {{with the intention of}} making <b>cross-platform</b> production more feasible. The idea for the engine sprang from Square Enix's desire to have a unified game development environment in order to effectively share the technology and know-how of the company's individual teams.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest X: Mezameshi Itsutsu no Shuzoku Online is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG) {{developed and}} published by Square Enix. It is the tenth mainline entry in the Dragon Quest franchise, and the first online-only game in the series. Originally released for the Wii, it was later ported to Wii U, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. Later cloud streamed versions were released for Android, iOS and Nintendo 3DS. All versions of the game support <b>cross-platform</b> play between all platforms. The original version released in 2012, with expansion packs released throughout the 2010s.|$|E
5|$|Each game in {{the main}} series {{takes place in a}} {{different}} fictional universe, although beginning with Final Fantasy X-2, additional video games set in the main series games' worlds have been released. Compilation of Final Fantasy VII and Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy are <b>cross-platform</b> multimedia projects consisting of games, films, books, and other media centered on their respective main series game, Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy XIII. Final Fantasy Tactics, although originally envisioned as a spin-off game, became its own series as part of Ivalice Alliance, which counts Final Fantasy XII in its membership.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XI {{was awarded}} the grand prize from the Japan's Consumer Entertainment Software Association (CESA) for 2002–2003 along with Taiko no Tatsujin. It has also {{received}} GameSpy's 2003 PC MMORPG Game of the Year Award and IGN's Game of the Month for March 2004, citing the game's huge customization and its successful <b>cross-platform</b> and cross-language game world. Final Fantasy XI was referenced in the online game Minna no Golf Online {{in the form of}} a Final Fantasy XI-themed lobby. At 2009's Electronic Entertainment Expo, Square Enix revealed Final Fantasy XIV Online, which was Square Enix's next MMORPG.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XI, {{also known}} as Final Fantasy XI Online, is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG), developed and published by Square (later Square Enix) {{as part of the}} Final Fantasy series. Designed and produced by Hiromichi Tanaka, it was released in Japan on May 16, 2002, for PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows-based personal computers in November of that year. The game was the first MMORPG to offer <b>cross-platform</b> play between PlayStation 2 and personal computer. It was also the Xbox 360's first MMORPG. All versions of the game require a monthly subscription to play.|$|E
5|$|For {{lines with}} three or four tracks with express service, local stops will have side {{platforms}} and the middle one or two tracks will not stop at the station. On these lines, express stations typically have two island platforms, one for the local and express in one direction, and another for the local and express in the other direction. Each island platform provides a <b>cross-platform</b> interchange between local and express services. Some lines with four-track express service have two tracks each on two levels and use both island and side platforms.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 2010, Revolution Software {{announced}} {{the release of}} Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror - Remastered on iOS devices, and was released on December 16, 2010. The new features include an exclusive interactive digital comic from Dave Gibbons, fully animated facial expressions, enhanced graphics, high quality music, a context-sensitive hint system, diary, and a Dropbox integration which facilitates a unique <b>cross-platform</b> save-game feature, enabling players to enjoy the same adventure simultaneously on multiple devices. It also featured full Game Center integration – including in-game achievements. The Mac and PC versions followed in early 2011.|$|E
5|$|The Brook Avenue station {{just east}} of Third Avenue–138th Street on the IRT Pelham Line would be reconstructed to allow a <b>cross-platform</b> interchange. Further north, {{there would be a}} {{connection}} with the IRT Pelham Line near Westchester Avenue at the Whitlock Avenue station, and station platforms north to Pelham Bay Park would be narrowed and lengthened to accommodate the longer and wider B Division trains from the Second Avenue Subway. IRT local service on the Pelham Line would terminate at Hunts Point Avenue one stop south.|$|E
5|$|The Central {{line station}} opened on 30 July 1900, and the Bakerloo line station on 10 March 1906. Both are Grade II listed. The station was rebuilt in 1912 to relieve {{congestion}}. Further congestion {{led to another}} reconstruction in 1923. Numerous improvements were made {{as part of the}} New Works Programme and as a flood protection measure. To accommodate additional passengers on the Victoria line, a new ticket hall was built. The Victoria line station opened on 7 March 1969, including <b>cross-platform</b> interchange with the Bakerloo line.|$|E
5|$|The main Python implementation, named CPython, {{is written}} in C, meeting the C89 standard, with several select C99 features. It compiles Python {{programs}} into intermediate bytecode, which is executed by the virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written {{in a mixture of}} C and Python. It is available in versions for many platforms, including Windows and most modern Unix-like systems. CPython was intended from almost its very conception to be <b>cross-platform.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{proposal}} for a new underground railway running from Victoria to Walthamstow was first proposed by a Working Party {{set up by the}} British Transport Commission in 1948, though that largely followed a 1946 plan for an East Croydon to Finsbury Park line. A route was approved in 1955 with future extensions to be decided later, though funding for the construction was not approved by the government until 1962. Construction began in 1962 on the initial Walthamstow to Victoria section. The Victoria line platforms opened on 7 March 1969. The station opened as part of a second extension from Warren Street to Victoria. <b>Cross-platform</b> interchange between the Bakerloo and Victoria lines was provided by constructing the Victoria line platforms parallel to the Bakerloo ones.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009, Square Enix {{announced}} {{they had decided}} not to use PlayOnline for Final Fantasy XIV due to the marked decrease of content on the service. Instead, they would migrate to a new service that still allowed <b>cross-platform</b> gameplay, including the use of a universal Square Enix ID that would allow players to play from wherever they left off. In June 2011, Square Enix announced that they would merge the account management portion of the PlayOnline service into Square Enix accounts from July 2011 and culminate on August 31, 2011. However, PlayOnline is still required in order to actually play Final Fantasy XI. Square Enix replicated the idea of the friends list from Final Fantasy XI in Final Fantasy XIV. The termination date of service for Final Fantasy XI and PlayOnline for PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 was March 2016.|$|E
5|$|Initially, BioWare {{denied that}} a PlayStation 3 version {{was in the}} works. Despite this, it was {{reported}} that the Microsoft Windows version of the game featured lines of code referencing the PlayStation 3. BioWare responded that the Unreal Engine 3 is a <b>cross-platform,</b> which is the reason why it includes PlayStation 3 code. Eventually, a PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2 was released a year later than the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 versions of the game. The PlayStation 3 version uses {{a modified version of the}} Unreal Engine 3 called Mass Effect 3 engine; the same engine BioWare used for the then-upcoming Mass Effect 3. In this newer version, character models were slightly improved and controls were updated to support the PlayStation 3 controller. An option which allowed to switch back to the Xbox 360 controls layout was also added.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{announced}} at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011 {{that they would}} be releasing two new Super Smash Bros. games, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, making it the first <b>cross-platform</b> and first portable release in the series. Cross-compatibility between the Wii U and 3DS versions was also confirmed, allowing players to customize their characters and transfer them between versions. While development had begun, Sakurai stated that the early announcement was made public in order to attract developers needed for the game. The titles are also the first games to utilize Nintendo's Amiibo platform. The new Super Smash Bros. titles were released in late 2014.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, 2010, Valve {{announced}} that Steam was developing a client for OS X. The announcement {{was preceded by}} {{a change in the}} Steam beta client to support the <b>cross-platform</b> WebKit web browser rendering engine instead of the Trident engine of Internet Explorer. Before this announcement, Valve teased the release by e-mailing several images to Mac community and gaming websites; the images featured characters from Valve games with Apple logos and parodies of vintage Macintosh advertisements. Valve developed a full video homage to Apple's 1984 Macintosh commercial to announce the availability of Half-Life 2 and its episodes on the service; some concept images for the video had previously been used to tease the Mac Steam client.|$|E
5|$|Rogers has livestreamed prerelease {{sessions}} of Videoball via Twitch. He broadcast gameplay from Twitch's booth at PAX East 2014 with indie publisher Midnight City. In February 2014, PC Gamer Wes Fenlon {{reported that the}} game still had work left in its artwork, soundtrack, new arenas, and online multiplayer mode. Videoball was selected for the July 2014 Evolution Championship Series fighting game tournament's Indie Showcase. The developers had plans to include <b>cross-platform</b> multiplayer, support {{for more than six}} simultaneous players, and a campaign mode. Rogers has said that ranked matchmaking was highly requested by fans. Videoball was planned for release in 2014, and ultimately launched on July 12, 2016, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows, with Iron Galaxy as its publisher. OS X and Linux releases are planned.|$|E
5|$|Sony {{launched}} a multimillion-dollar ad {{campaign to promote}} Final Fantasy XI along with the PlayStation 2 hard drive add-on which the game required. Having been released on the PlayStation 2 {{as well as the}} personal computer, it became the first <b>cross-platform</b> MMORPG ever created. On June 14, 2002, the game server was down for four hours for maintenance to the database servers, bug fixes on the text interface, and a new patch for the game client. This is thought to be the first patch ever released for a console game. Other early issues included complaints by American players that experienced Japanese players had already completed all the quests. Square Enix responded by adding new servers in order to have game worlds with fewer expert players.|$|E
5|$|The Xbox 360 {{does not}} have support for Steamworks. Newell {{said that they would}} have liked to bring the service to the console through the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which would have allowed Valve to provide the same feature set that it did for the PlayStation 3, but later said that <b>cross-platform</b> play would not be present in {{the final version of the}} game. Valve {{attributes}} the inability to use Steamworks on the Xbox 360 to limitations in the Xbox Live regulations of the ability to deliver patches and new content. Valve's Erik Johnson stated that Microsoft requires that new content must be certified and validated before distribution, which would limit the usefulness of Steamworks' delivery approach.|$|E
5|$|The {{announcement}} that Portal 2 {{would be available}} on PlayStation 3 {{came as a surprise}} to the industry because Gabe Newell had criticized that console in the past, citing difficulties in the port of The Orange Box. The move toward the PlayStation 3 was a result of growing frustration with Microsoft's policies for Xbox 360 content, including the difficulty of pushing patching and new content to players. Newell saw Sony's publication model as more open, allowing Steam-like features to be used on the console. Portal 2 was the first PlayStation 3 game to support a subset of features from Steamworks, including automatic updates, downloadable content, and community support. The game supports <b>cross-platform</b> play between the PlayStation 3, Windows, and OS X versions.|$|E
5|$|The second {{version of}} the project, {{tentatively}} called Chrono Trigger: Brink of Time then Chrono Resurrection, started development in April 2003. Lazur has given several reasons to explain his willingness to restart the project, including his experience coding for the Dreamcast Visual Memory Unit, programming for game developer DC Studios, and playing Chrono Cross, the official sequel to Chrono Trigger for PlayStation. Unlike CT64, the second version would be a short demo developed in a <b>cross-platform</b> engine with a single 3D playing mode. The Windows version was planned for a free Internet release, while Nintendo GameCube and Xbox ports would be reserved for official developers with access to development kits of {{either of the two}} consoles.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Halo Wars 2 {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} professional critics. The campaign cinematics, created by Blur Studio, were lauded for their outstanding animation quality. Reviewers found {{the game to}} be very approachable to beginners but {{felt that it was}} in need of more strategic depth to gain popularity amongst experienced RTS players. Several nuisances present in the game's keyboard and mouse controls left some critics disappointed, however, enhancements made to the gamepad control scheme from the first Halo Wars were praised. Post-release, the game has been supported with additional content and updates such as support for <b>cross-platform</b> play. A campaign expansion, titled Awakening the Nightmare, was released in 2017.|$|E
5|$|According to Yoichi Wada, then-CEO of Square Enix, XIV {{was being}} planned {{as a serious}} rival to {{successful}} western MMORPG World of Warcraft. The game was developed primarily for Windows, and was then ported across to PS3. XIV was originally scheduled for simultaneous release on Windows and PS3 in 2010, but the PS3 version was delayed into 2011. This was explained as due to it taking longer than expected to make the adjustments needed so the game could fit within the console's limited memory. The game {{did not use the}} PlayOnline service used for XI. This was explained as being due to the marked decrease of content on the service. Instead, they would migrate to a new service that still allowed <b>cross-platform</b> gameplay, including the use of a universal Square Enix ID that would allow players to play from wherever they left off. In October 2009, the game's Beta release was announced as being only for Windows. First print runs of the PS3 version of Final Fantasy XIII contained a bonus code for the PS3 version of XIV for a special in-game item.|$|E
