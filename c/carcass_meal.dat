40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the dry matter degradability of mophane worm and <b>carcass</b> <b>meal.</b> It is believed that farmers {{in the region are}} using mophane as a source of protein for their livestock. Nylon bags were used to incubate mophane and <b>carcass</b> <b>meal</b> samples in the rumen of two steers for different time periods. After each time period the bags were removed and washed under tap water. The residue in the bag was weighed and the percentage degradability was expressed as the amount of dry matter that disappeared after weighing the residue. Percentage dry matter disappearing was plotted against time and the graph used to derive degradation constants. It was found that mophane worm have higher readily soluble material a`, than <b>carcass</b> <b>meal</b> (33 versus 8 %). This, together with the extent of degradation reaction, resulted in a higher degradation for mophnae worm than <b>carcass</b> <b>meal.</b> However, degradation of <b>carcass</b> <b>meal</b> was faster than that of mophane worm (0. 171 verses 0. 086 - 1), but this did not improve the degradability of carcass as the degradation curve was lower than that of mophane worm. This may be due to an exhaustion of degradable material caused by the heat treatment of <b>carcass</b> <b>meal.</b> At an assumed passage rate of 0. 05 - 1, mophane worm had a higher effective degradability (ED) than <b>carcass</b> <b>meal.</b> This means that more mophane worm would be fermented in the rumen than <b>carcass</b> <b>meal.</b> In order to protect some of the mophane worm from rumen fermentation, it would be necessary to provide heat treatment either by roasting or baking...|$|E

Utilizou-se o mÃsculo longissimus dorsi para as avaliaÃÃes qualitativas da carne, perda de peso por cocÃÃo, forÃa de cisalhamento, teor de lipÃdios, perfil de Ãcidos graxos, teor de proteÃnas, cinzas e umidade alÃm da anÃlise sensorial. A dieta com 100 % de farelo de mamona apresentou menor valor em rendimento de carcaÃa fria, perÃmetro de perna e profundidade de tÃrax. NÃo foi observada diferenÃa estatÃstica entre os tratamentos testados, para o peso e rendimento dos cortes, no entanto a dieta influenciou o rendimento do costilhar que apresentou menor valor para o tratamento com 66 % de substituiÃÃo de farelo de mamona. A estimativa de musculosidade da carcaÃa sofreu efeito da dieta, na relaÃÃo mÃsculo:osso da perna, verificou-se menor mÃdia para aqueles alimentados com 100 % de farelo de mamona. Houve diferenÃa entre os tecidos constituintes da perna, tecido muscular, Ãsseo e outros tecidos, na paleta diferiram os tecidos Ãsseos e outros tecidos. A Ãrea de olho de lombo foi similar entre os tratamentos. Verificou-se efeito significativo (p< 0, 05) entre os tratamentos para a composiÃÃo centesimal, com menor percentual de gordura, proteÃna e umidade nos nÃveis de substituiÃÃo 66, 100 e 33 %, respectivamente. A substituiÃÃo do farelo de mamona proporcionou um perfil de Ãcidos graxos interessantes Ã saÃde do consumidor, apresentando os melhores Ãndices para as relaÃÃes avaliadas entre os Ãcidos graxos. NÃo foi observada diferenÃa estatÃstica entre os tratamentos para os parÃmetros pH e forÃa de cisalhamento no entanto verificou-se efeito dos nÃveis de substituiÃÃo na perda de peso por cocÃÃo apresentando menor percentual 24, 42 % (p< 0, 05) em 33 % de substituiÃÃo. Avaliaram-se as caracterÃsticas sensoriais considerando os atributos dureza, suculÃncia, sabor, cor, aroma e aceitaÃÃo global. Foi evidenciado que a dieta com 33 % de substituiÃÃo proporciona uma carne com maior dureza, sem, contudo, comprometer a sua aceitaÃÃo.

Pode-se concluir que a utilizaÃÃo de dietas contendo farelo de mamona destoxificado em substituiÃÃo parcial ao farelo de soja nÃo interfere nas caracterÃsticas de carcaÃa de ovinos Santa InÃs, bem como nos pesos e rendimentos dos cortes comerciais e composiÃÃo tecidual, mantendo a qualidade fÃsico-quÃmica e sensorial. The {{objective of}} this study was to determine the characteristics of carcass and meat of Santa InÃs lambs submitted to four experimental treatments with increasing concentrations of detoxified castor meal (0 %, 33 %, 66 % and 100 %) with dry matter basis. The bulk used consisted of mixed silage of elephant grass, sorghum and sugar cane. Thirty-two non-castrated male lambs were used and slaughtered with average body weight of 30 kg. Experimental tests were conducted in a completely randomized design with four treatments and eight replications (lambs). Data were submitted ANOVA and means compared by Tukey test at 5 %. The animals were fasted of food and water for 24 hours and bleeding was performed with section of carotid artery and jugular vein, followed by evisceration. After slaughter, the carcasses were chilled for 24 hours at 4 ÂC and pH was measured on the semimembranosus muscle at 45 minutes and 24 hours after slaughter, also determining weight, hot and cold carcass yield and morphometric measurements. The carcass was longitudinally sectioned into half carcasses, and retail cuts such as leg, loin, rib, rear, neck and shoulder on the right half carcass were obtained, followed by weighing and freezing of shoulder and leg for further evaluation of tissue composition. The longissimus dorsi muscle was used for the qualitative assessments of meat, weight loss due to cooking, shear force, fat content, fatty acid profile, protein content, ash, moisture and sensory analysis. Diet with 100 % of castor meal showed the lowest cold carcass yield, leg circumference and chest depth. No statistical difference between treatments was observed for weight and cut yields; however, the diet influenced the rib yield, which showed the lowest value for treatment with 66 % of castor <b>meal.</b> <b>Carcass</b> muscularity was affected by the diet, and in the muscle: bone ratio of the leg, a lower average for those fed with 100 % of castor meal was observed. There were differences between tissue constituents of leg, muscle, bone and other tissues, and in the palette, bone and other tissues differed. The rib eye area was similar between treatments. There was a significant effect (p < 0. 05) between treatments for the centesimal composition, with lower percentage of fat, protein and moisture at substitution levels of 66, 100 and 33 % respectively. The substitution of castor meal provided an interesting fatty acids profile for consumer health, featuring the best ratios for the evaluated relations between fatty acids. There was no statistical difference between treatments for parameters pH and shear force; however, there was an effect of the substitution in weight loss due to cooking, showing lower percentage 24. 42 % (p < 0. 05) in 33 % of substitution. The sensory characteristics were evaluated considering attributes such as hardness, juiciness, flavor, color, aroma and overall acceptability. It was shown that diet with 33 % of substitution provided meat with higher hardness but without compromising its acceptance. There was no change in the other meat sensory attributes. It could be concluded that the use of diets containing detoxified castor meal as partial substitution for soybean meal does not affect the carcass characteristics of Santa InÃs lambs, weight and yield of retail cuts and tissue composition, maintaining its physicochemical and sensory quality...|$|R

O produto defumado foi submetido à moagem para obtenção das farinhas, a partir das quais foram elaborados o caldo e a canja. Porções das farinhas, dos caldos e das canjas foram avaliadas por um painel de 40 provadores utilizando-se um método de estímulo simples, sendo avaliados os atributos: aroma, sabor, cor, textura, aparência e aceitação geral. Não houve diferença significativa (P > 0, 05) na aceitação geral dos produtos. Os caldos elaborados com estas farinhas tiveram uma {{excelente}} aceitação, não diferindo significativamente entre si no que se refere aos atributos avaliados. A canja elaborada a partir da farinha de carcaça de pacu apresentou as menores notas quando comparada às demais canjas. Portanto, as farinhas aromatizadas podem ser empregadas no enriquecimento de produtos para o consumo humano. Esses produtos podem ser aplicados na merenda escolar, melhorando a qualidade nutricional das refeições.

This work {{evaluated the}} acceptance of soups and broths prepared with aromatized meals made from smoked fish carcasses. The species of fish used for smoking were Nile Tilapia, carp, and pacu. The carcasses were washed, labeled, weighted, immersed in a solution of brine with aromatic herbs, and smoked. The smoked product was crushed to obtain the meal, which was used to cook the soups and the broths. Portions of meals, broths and soups were sampled by 40 tasters based on a simple stimulus method, which evaluated characteristics such as aroma, flavor, color, texture, aspect, and general acceptance. Considering the three species of fish used to prepare the meals, there were not significant differences (P > 0, 05) in the products general acceptance. Soups made with these meals had an excellent acceptance, and so no notable differences in the evaluated attributes were found. The broth made with pacu <b>carcass</b> <b>meal</b> was rated the lowest comparing to the other broths. Therefore, aromatized meals {{can be used to}} supplement products destined to human consumption.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the dietary protein requirements of the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) between the ages of 5 – 8 months, and to compare the results with documented protein requirements of the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis). This was achieved by feeding the crocodiles 4 diets with varying amounts of crude protein (CP), including 62 %, 56. 6 %, 51. 6 % and 46 %. All four diets were iso-energetic with a metabolisable energy to protein ratio of 25. 85 KJ/g. The highest protein diet contained 44 % raw minced chicken and 46. 9 % fish meal with minimal contribution (of 6. 4 %) made from vegetable protein sources (full fat soya). The lowest protein diet was made up of a majority of vegetable protein (30 % soya bean oilcake, 9. 8 % full fat soya and 17. 2 % maize meal) and some contribution from protein of animal origin (4. 3 % <b>carcass</b> <b>meal</b> and 35 % fish meal). This study was carried out for 12 weeks during the crocodiles first year of life. Body mass, total body length, head length and snout to vent length were measured five times at 3 weekly intervals. Twenty representative crocodiles in a pen of 200 were individually tagged for the duration of the trial. As there were 3 replicates for each of the 4 treatment diets, 240 crocodiles in 12 pens were tagged. During the early phase of the study, it was observed that crocodiles on the 46 % CP treatment diet were not performing well, and that most of the crocodiles on this diet were losing mass. This treatment diet was discontinued at 9 weeks into the trial for both financial and ethical reasons. The remaining three diets were tested for the full 12 weeks. Chromium oxide was mixed into the diets at two time periods during the trial to determine the protein, energy and dry matter digestibility. It was determined that the 46 %, the 51. 6 %, the 56. 6 % and the 62 % CP diets had a digestible protein (DP) content of 246. 44 g/kg, 294. 80 g/kg, 381. 32 g/kg and 468. 65 g/kg and a digestibility coefficient of 53. 50 %, 57. 00 %, 69. 15 % and 75. 65 % respectively. Performance of crocodiles on the 46 % CP treatment diet was found to be lower in all measurement categories than crocodiles on the three higher protein diets. However, crocodiles on the 62 % CP treatment diet outperformed all the crocodiles (on all measurement criteria) on the lower protein diets. The poor performance of crocodiles on the lowest protein diet correlates with previous research indicating that crocodilians are unable to perform optimally when the majority of the diet’s protein is made up of vegetable protein sources. It was determined that juvenile American alligators would grow at optimal levels when the diet contained a DP content of 450 g/kg. As the Nile crocodiles in this study performed the best when the diet contained a DP value of 468. 65 g/kg, it was concluded that juvenile Nile crocodiles have the same range of protein requirements as that determined for juvenile American alligators.

40|$|The {{proximate}} {{composition of}} juvenile spotted grunter, Pomadasys commersonnii and their major prey items were analyzed {{to test the}} hypothesis that the dietary protein requirements would approximate the composition of the natural diet. The amino acid profile of juvenile P. commersonnii was analyzed to establish the pattern of limiting amino acids for this species. Juvenile P. commersonnii feed primarily on the mysid, Mesopodopsis slabberi, which has a protein content of 58. 27 ± 0. 04 % and a calorific value of 19. 2 kJ/g. The first-limiting essential amino acid for this fish was found to be lysine and it was predicted that the optimal dietary protein requirement would be between 50 and 60 %. The optimal dietary protein inclusion level was investigated by feeding semi-purified diets containing graded levels of protein, ranging from 37 - 62 %. Maximum growth was found to occur at dietary protein levels ranging from 40 - 51 %. The best food conversion ratio was achieved at 56 % dietary protein and the best protein efficiency ratio was obtained at a dietary protein inclusion level of 37 - 40 %. The protein to energy ratio was defined by feeding 3 different protein levels at 3 different P:E levels. These semi-purified diets contained 35, 45 or 55 % protein and 6, 8 or 12 % dietary lipid, resulting in protein to energy ratios ranging from 21. 1 to 42. 3 mg/kJ. The optimal P:E ratio for this species was found to be 26. 7 mg/kJ. This diet effected a low food conversion ratio (1. 72 ± 0. 19), a low hepatosomatic index (4. 01 ± 0. 23) and a high specific growth rate (5. 96 ± 0. 36). The essential amino acid requirements of juvenile P. commersonnii were investigated. Semi-purified diets were formulated to contain graded levels of crystalline lysine based on the amino acid profile of the whole body and fed to the fish for a period of 60 days. Fish fed the "ideal protein" diet had significantly higher (p< 0. 05) specific growth rates (2. 95 ± 0. 18), protein efficiency ratios (0. 41 ± 0. 05) and significantly lower (p< 0. 05) food conversion ratios (3. 02 ± 0. 29). Lysine levels in the whole body increased with increasing levels of supplemented lysine. The dietary requirement of lysine was found to be 4. 30 % of dietary protein. The crude protein digestibility of six protein sources was investigated. Diets were prepared with 1 % chromic oxide as an internal marker. The tested protein sources included low temperature Danish fishmeal, steam dried Chilean fishmeal, blood meal, <b>carcass</b> <b>meal,</b> defatted soyabean meal and Spirulina meal. These potential fishmeal substitutes were selected due to their favourable amino acid profiles, and in particular their high levels of lysine, and their high protein content. Both the animal and the plant protein sources were highly digestible. Digestibility co-efficients ranged from 66. 09 % for Spirulina meal to 73. 38 % for low temperature Danish fishmeal. The results have shown that juvenile spotted grunter require a minimum of 40 % crude protein in their diet, a P:E ratio of 26. 7 mg/kJ and a lysine concentration of 4. 30 % of the dietary protein. Long term growth trials are needed to confirm these results. The hypothesis that the proximate composition of the natural diet, and the proximate composition of the animal under investigation, provides a reliable indication of the animals' nutritional requirements was shown to be valid. Differences between the predicted, and the empirically determined optimal protein and protein:energy ratios were slight...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} to reduce feed formulation costs by {{the replacement of}} existing proteinsources in artificial feeds for Haliotis midae was assessed. A comparison between {{the efficacy of the}} direct method and chromic oxide marker techniques in determining apparent protein digestibility coefficients, revealed that while the former was not a suitable methodology for use with this species, the latter produced replicable and reliable results. It was established that the chromic oxide marker is inert, is not absorbed by the abalone, does not interfere with the digestive processes and moves through the intestine at the same rate to the protein. However, as this method was time consuming and expensive to implement, a multienzyme pH-stat in vitro protein digestibility technique using a three enzyme system was employed to rapidly assess the protein quality of 34 protein sources. The efficacy of the technique was established by correlating the in vitro digestibility estimates with in vivo digestibility coefficients obtained using the chromic oxide marker technique. The highest degree of in vivo predictability was attained when protein sources were separated according to origin, and significant correlations between either animal (r²= 0. 89, P< 0. 004) or plant (r²= 0. 79, P< 0. 04) protein sources were found. The effect of animal size on the qualitative protein requirements of two size classes of H. midae was assessed by feeding 12 isonitrogenous and isoenergetic single protein diets to juvenile and young adult animals (10 - 20 and 40 - 50 mm shell length). The criteria for protein source selection were their bioavailability as determined using the pH-stat in vitro digestibility technique, and their cost and availability within South Africa. The protein sources identified for the trial comprised four fishmeals, casein, spirulina, abalone viscera silage, brewery waste, torula yeast, carcass, sunflower and cotton meals. The results indicated that in terms of growth and feed efficiency, the fishmeals and spirulina were the most suitable candidates as primary protein sources in formulated feeds for H. midae, and with the exceptions of the <b>carcass</b> <b>meal</b> and brewery waste, the remaining protein sources demonstrated promise as partial primary protein source replacements. The smaller size class of abalone displayed significantly reduced growth, feed and protein efficiency than their larger counterparts. In terms of feed conversion and growth response, two-way analysis of variance revealed significant interactions between protein source and animal size, suggesting that qualitative differences exist between the dietary protein requirements of the juvenile and young adult abalone. The commercial implication of thisfinding was discussed. An evaluation was undertaken {{to determine the effects of}} the partial and total replacement of dietary fishmeal with selected plant protein sources on growth and nutritional indices of juvenile H. midae. A commercial “Abfeed” formulation in which 100 % of the protein component comprised LT-fishmeal was employed as a control. Fifteen isonitrogenous experimental diets were formulated in which the LT fishmeal was substituted at either 10, 15, 30, 50, 75 or 100 % with either spirulina, semolina, ground maize, torula yeast, soya, sunflower or corn gluten meals or combinations thereof. No significant differences were found in the growth rates between the control diet and those diets in which 30 % of the fishmeal component had been replaced by either soya, sunflower meal, or torula yeast. In addition, 50 % of the fishmeal component could be substituted with either soya meal or spirulina without affecting growth. Replacement of either 75 or 100 % of the fishmeal had a significant negative affect on growth. Pearson product moment correlations between dietary lysine levels and either growth rates or protein efficiency ratios revealed positive correlations (r= 0. 77, P= 0. 0005; r= 0. 52, P= 0. 04 respectively) suggesting that lysine may have been the first limiting amino acid in these diets. Carcass analysis revealed that dietary protein source had no significant effect on body composition. An assessment of the dietary arginine requirement of juvenile H. midae using whole proteins to supply graded levels of dietary arginine did not promote a growth response. It was concluded that arginine is probably not the first limiting amino acid in formulated feeds for H. midae. An assessment of the dietary lysine requirement of juvenile H. midae using two micro-encapsulation techniques (gelatin/acacia colloid or cellulose acetate phthalate) was not successful. The efficacy of the encapsulation techniques were established and an assessment of the degree of lysine supplementation undertaken. Failure of the crystalline lysine enriched diets to promote growth suggests that the prospects for using crystalline amino acids in essential amino acid requirement studies in H. midae is low. The results of the present study indicate that the prospects for replacing fishmeal with cheaper alternative protein sources in artificial feeds for H. midae is promising. Furthermore, while the technical difficulties such as the determination of the essential amino acid requirements of the abalone precluded the application of “least cost” programming, the prospects for its future application are promising...|$|E
