40|$|Abstract: The {{structural}} controller, {{described by}} adding the control places to the Petri nets, is introduced in this work to lead the Petri net to the desired marking vectors. An algorithm (Algorithm I) is developed to determine the control places for the given Petri net. The connections and the initial marking of each <b>control</b> <b>place</b> are determined in this algorithm. Moreover, a decentralized structural control approach, based on overlapping decompositions, is introduced in this work. In this decentralized approach, all disjoint Petri subnets, which are obtained by using overlapping decompositions, are determined. The control places for each Petri subnet are determined by using the given algorithm. Then, the control places for the orginal Petri net are obtained by the control places of each PSN by another algorithm (Algorithm II) and these places {{are added to the}} orginal Petri net. Therefore, a decentralized structural controller which guarantees to lead the Petri net to the desired marking vectors is obtained...|$|E

40|$|SummaryHippocampal CA 1 and CA 3 {{pyramidal}} neuron place cells encode the spatial location {{of an animal}} through localized firing patterns called “place fields. ” To explore the mechanisms that <b>control</b> <b>place</b> cell firing {{and their relationship to}} spatial memory, we studied mice with enhanced spatial memory resulting from forebrain-specific knockout of the HCN 1 hyperpolarization-activated cation channel. HCN 1 is strongly expressed in CA 1 neurons and in entorhinal cortex grid cells, which provide spatial information to the hippocampus. Both CA 1 and CA 3 place fields were larger but more stable in the knockout mice, with the effect greater in CA 1 than CA 3. As HCN 1 is only weakly expressed in CA 3 place cells, their altered activity likely reflects loss of HCN 1 in grid cells. The more pronounced changes in CA 1 likely reflect the intrinsic contribution of HCN 1. The enhanced place field stability may underlie the effect of HCN 1 deletion to facilitate spatial learning and memory...|$|E

This paperpresents a mathematical method to design a maximally permissivePetri net supervisor that is expressed {{by a set of}} control placeswith self-loops. A <b>control</b> <b>place</b> with a self-loop can be representedby a constraint and a self-loop associated with a transition whosefiring may lead to an illegal marking.

A marking reductionapproach is developed in order to cut down the considered markings,which can greatly decrease the computational overhead of theproposed method. An integer linear programming model is developed tocompress the number of control places, aiming to reduce thestructural complexity of the resulting supervisors.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a deadlock prevention algorithm {{for the class}} of sequential resource allocation system for flexible manufacturing systems, which allows for multiple resources flexible routings. Two classes of Petri nets Extended from Systems of Simple Sequential Processes with Resources (ES 3 PR) and Systems of Simple Sequential Processes with General Resource Requirements (S 3 PGR 2) whose deadlocks are related to unmarked siphons are considered. Based on the definition of ES 3 PR net, the original net is an ordinary Petri net. We further present a siphon-based algorithm of deadlock prevention for both classes of Petri nets. The proposed method is an iterative approach. We note that S 3 PGR 2 net structure is a weighted generalization of the ES 3 PR net. Based on this reason, the proposed algorithm {{can be applied to}} S 3 PGR 2 net if the target net is normalized to ordinary one.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two iterative deadlock prevention policies forflexible manufacturing systems (FMSs). Both {{can find}} a maximallypermissive liveness-enforcing supervisor with a small number ofcontrol places. A vector covering approach is used to obtain aminimal covering set of legal markings and a minimal covered set offirst-met bad markings (FBMs), which are {{much smaller than the}} setsof legal markings and FBMs, respectively. At each iteration, bysolving an integer linear programming problem (ILPP), a placeinvariant (PI) associated with a <b>control</b> <b>place</b> is designed to forbidas many FBMs as possible and no markings in the minimal covering setof legal markings are forbidden. The objective function of the ILPPmaximizes the number of FBMs that are forbidden by the PI. Then, theforbidden FBMs by the PI are removed from the minimal covered set ofFBMs. This process is carried out until all FBMs are forbidden. TwoILPP design techniques are developed for the control policies. Though the proposed methods cannot in general guarantee theminimality of the supervisory structure, they reduce the overallcomputational time greatly, which is shown by numerical studies.

40|$|Fork-join {{structures}} {{are important for}} modelling parallel and distributed systems where coordination and synchronisation occur, but their performance analysis is difficult. The study {{presented in this paper}} is motivated by the need to calculate performance measures for computer controlled (agile) manufacturing systems. We consider the manufacture of a class of products made from two components that are created by two parallel production lines. The components are then assembled, requiring synchronisation of the two lines. The products are only created on request from the client. The production lines need to be controlled so that one line does not get ahead of the other by more than a certain amount, N, a parameter of the system. We model this system with a Generalised Stochastic Petri Net, where N is the initial marking of a <b>control</b> <b>place.</b> The customer requests and the two production line rates are modelled by exponential distributions associated with three timed transitions in the model. We use TimeNET to calculate the stationary token distribution of the GSPN {{for a wide range of}} the rates as N increases. This reveals that the steady state probabilities converge. We characterise the range of transition rates for which useful convergence occurs and provide a method for obtaining the steady state probabilities to the desired accuracy for arbitrary N. ...|$|E

The automated system for thermographic crack detection uses brief pulsed eddy currents to heat steel components under inspection. Cracks, if present, will disturb the current flow and so generate changes in the temperature profile in the crack area. These changes of temperature are visualized using an infrared camera. The image acquired by the infrared camera is evaluated through an image processing system. The advantages afforded by the system are its inspection times, its excellent flaw detection sensitivity and its ability to detect hidden, subsurface cracks. The automated system consists of four IR cameras (each side of steel bar is evaluated at a time), coil, high frequency generator, and <b>control</b> <b>place</b> with computers. The system {{is a part of the}} inspection line where the subsurface and surface cracks are searched. If the crack is present, the cracked place is automatically marked.

We assume that the statistics of the processes follow exponential distributions, with requests to manufacture the product arriving at a rate λ 0 and the two production lines having rates λ 1 and λ 2. Generalised Stochastic Petri Nets (GSPN) are used to model this system where N is the initial marking of a <b>control</b> <b>place.</b> TimeNET is used to calculate the stationary token distribution of the GSPN as N increases, revealing convergence of the steady state probabilities.

Further, for λ 0 [*]> min(λ 1,λ 2) we discover geometric progressions in the steady state probabilities once they have converged. We use these progressions to derive closed form approximations, the accuracies of which increase as N increases. ...|$|E
