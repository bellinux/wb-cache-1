40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} asymmetries in the Russian intermediation premium {{as measured}} by the spread between the <b>commercial</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> and the Central Bank’s policy related rate. Empirical results have shown that the Russian intermediation premium adjusts to the threshold faster when the Central Bank’s policy related rates increase relative to lending rates as opposed to when the Central Bank’s policy related rates move in the opposite direction. The findings of this paper suggest that during the period when the Russian Federation faced formidable challenges from a sharp decline in oil prices and reduced access to international capital markets due to Western sanctions, the Central Bank of Russia was not effective in utilizing countercyclical monetary policy to achieve macroeconomic objectives and commercial banks exhibited predatory pricing behavior. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} corruption and government control of the banking system on the sensitivity of commercial lending rates to changes in international financial market conditions. Using a sample of 18 countries located in the Western hemisphere (the “Americas”), we find that most countries ’ lending rates are insensitive to changes in international financial market conditions. Only the least corrupt nations, which also have zero or low levels of government control of the banking system, exhibited a significant positive relation between commercial lending rates and international financial market conditions. The responsiveness of these short-term lending rates is nonlinearly related to the levels of corruption and government control of banks in the economy. Countries with less corruption and government intervention {{are more likely to}} allocate credit based on market-wide influences rather than fall prey to the pressures of special interest groups. The nonlinear effects of corruption and government intervention suggest that low-to-moderate levels of corruption may actually lower commercial lending rates while high levels of corruption can increase commercial lending rates.

40|$|As {{a result}} of reforms and {{financial}} sector development, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) now exerts significant control over money market interest rates. With money market conditions increasingly influencing effective <b>commercial</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rates,</b> the PBoC is also able to affect the cost of credit without recourse to its benchmark commercial bank rates. Furthermore, interest rates are an important determinant of investment spending in China, via the user cost of capital, and aggregate economic activity influences inflation. Hence, greater use of interest rates in implementing monetary policy would enhance macroeconomic stabilisation while avoiding a number of drawbacks of the current quantity-based approach. In addition, increased flexibility in the exchange rate would enhance its role in offsetting macroeconomic shocks and allow the PBoC more scope to tailor monetary policy to domestic macroeconomic conditions. Concurrently, changes in the PBoC’s policy stance should be predicated on informed judgments based on the monitoring {{of a set of}} indicators in conjunction with a flexible inflation objective as the nominal anchor. 1 Paul Conway was formerly on the OECD China desk and is now CEO of Econconsult Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The high <b>commercial</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> Nicaragua is {{currently}} experiencing, {{together with a}} perceived scarcity of credit, have often been blamed for the country's slow growth and have been considered a major failing of the adjustment program initiated in 1991. The author insists that such blame is largely misplaced. Current interest rates are indeed higher than historical levels or international benchmark rates (such as LIBOR or the U. S. treasury bill rate), but those are not the appropriate comparators for Nicaragua today. On the other hand, Nicaragua's real interest rates have risen significantly {{in recent years and}} currently exceed real rates in other Central American countries. These high real rates are attributable entirely to a real currency depreciation that has been taking place since 1992, and are not greatly different from rates observed in other Latin American countries that underwent similar adjustments. The author explains the link between real interest rates and adjustment in Nicaragua and, in that context, explores policy options for reducing interest rates. The author's main conclusion: a sustained reduction in real interest rates to below those observed in neighboring countries would require further major structural cahnges, such as the adoption of a foreign currency standard.

The estimated results indicate that, changes in the policy rate are transmitted completely to loans rate in the long run during the pre-cosolidation but incomplete during the post-consolidation period. The results also show evidence for asymmetric momentum threshold autoregression models during the both the pre-and post-consolidation periods. However, while the estimated nonlinear error correction models exhibit downward rigidity in <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> during the pre-consolidation, a contrary finding was obtained during the post-consolidation period, which indicates upward rigidity of loans rates.

40|$|M. Com. (Economic Management) South Africa, as a {{developing}} country, {{has an enormous}} need for capital. Between 1980 to 1983, an amount of RBO billion was spent on fixed capital investment alone in this country. A large component of this investment originates from external sources and was financed by way of off-shore loans and other credit facilities. The developed countries, {{in order to promote}} their exports, have long realised that in addition to offering a competitive price and high quality product, competition also required that credit be made available to the importer. Presently the competition between the leading export countries result in the development of subsidised export credit schemes to promote the sale of industrial machinery and equipment. In cases where the fixed export finance rate is lower than market rates, Governments make up the difference between the export finance <b>rate</b> and <b>commercial</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rates.</b> Normally a fixed interest rate for the credit period is available in the exporter's currency. An important consideration when borrowing overseas, is the foreign currency exposure. With continuous fluctuations in the value of currencies the borrower is faced with a foreign exchange risk. This risk can be partially eliminated by hedging on the forward exchange market. In this study an analysis was made of the most important export credit schemes as well as the possible influence of forward exchange considerations. An importer has the option to also make use imported capital goods.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{transmission}} of monetary policy {{in terms of the}} interest rate pass-through in the case of Chile. Specifically, we are interested in the response of the <b>commercial</b> bank <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> to a money market interest rate movement. International evidence sug-gests that <b>lending</b> interest <b>rates</b> are somewhat sluggish to adjust to changes in the policy rate. This stickiness is generally related to lack of competition in the banking sector, capital flow restrictions, and volatility of the policy rate. One of the first comprehensive empirical studies on bank interest rate pass-through for monetary policy is Cottarelli and Kourelis (1994). They find important differences among countries: the estimated im-pact effects vary between 0. 06 and 0. 83, and the long-run effects range from 0. 59 to 1. 48, with an average of 0. 97. Our estimates for the Chilean case are an impact of 0. 81 and a long-run pass-through of 0. 97 for nominal interest rates. Previous studies suggest that sluggish adjustment is associated with market conditions and regulation of the banking sector. In this paper, we use bank-level data to explore other factors that may influ-ence the degree of delay in market interest rate response to changes in the policy rate.

40|$|Most {{central banks}} use {{short-term}} interest rates as their main instrument of monetary policy. It is assumed that a change in policy rate will influence interest rates set by commercial banks, {{but this is not}} usually the case. Commercial banks adjust their interest rates in response to changes in policy rate with lags, which make their interest rates sticky. Stickiness in commercial banks interest rates have been seen as an obstacle to the smooth transmission of monetary policy decisions. Despite the importance of the transmission process, little attention has been given to a systematic measurement of the degree of response of commercial banks‟ interest rates to changes in monetary policy stance in the Anglophone West African countries, specifically within the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) economies. Against this backdrop, this study explores the interest rate adjustment dynamics using monthly interest rate series on discount rate, treasury bill rate, commercial banks‟ deposit and <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> from 1989 to 2009 (for Gambia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone) and from 2000 to 2009 (for Ghana). Specifically, the study set out to examine how <b>lending</b> and deposit <b>rates</b> respond to changes in the official rates and to see whether there is a convergence among the rates over time. Also, to examine the relative adjustment of <b>commercial</b> bank <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> to changes in the official rate when there is disequilibrium. The analyses were twofold: a full sample period and a rolling window analysis. Following Cottarelli and Kourelis (1994), the study employed cointegration technique and an asymmetric error correction model to obtain the short-run and long-run parameters from which the error correction coefficients, mean adjustment lags and asymmetric mean adjustment lags were estimated. The results for the entire sample period revealed that the long-run pass-through in Nigeria was 81 % and 67 % for <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> and deposit rates respectively. In Ghana, it was 66 % and 69 % for <b>lending</b> and deposit <b>rates</b> respectively. While in Sierra Leone, long-run pass-through was 62 % and 72 % for <b>lending</b> and deposit <b>rates</b> respectively. In Gambia, it was 50 % and 40 % for <b>lending</b> and deposit <b>rates</b> respectively. On the other hand, the short-run pass-through was found to be lower compared to the long-run pass-through: in Nigeria it was 66 % and 47 %; in Gambia, 26 % and 29 %; in Sierra Leone, 30 % and 13 %; and in Ghana, - 6 % and 35 % for <b>lending</b> and deposit <b>rates</b> respectively in each country. The pass-through estimates for the rolling windows were mixed for short-run and long-run pass-through. The mean adjustment lags suggest that the speed of adjustment of <b>Lending</b> <b>rates</b> for full sample period were two, two, seven and twelve months in Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone and Gambia respectively. While for deposit rates they were five, six, seven and eighteen for Ghana, Nigeria, Gambia and Sierra Leone respectively. The average speeds of adjustment for the rolling windows were four and five months for <b>lending</b> and deposit <b>rates</b> respectively. Weak evidence of convergence was found in <b>lending</b> and deposit <b>rates</b> in the short-run and long-run pass-through among the countries. However, the results suggest that the magnitude and speed of the pass-through amongst the countries on average were high compared to emerging Asian countries. Significant asymmetric adjustments were found in the <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> for Gambia and Sierra Leone, while in Gambia and Nigeria there were asymmetries in deposit rates. Based on the evidence provided, interest rate pass-through is high in Nigeria and Ghana compared to Gambia and Sierra Leone and this calls for the harmonization of financial policies {{on the part of the}} financial authorities in the WAMZ. Viewed solely from an interest rate pass-through, the lack of convergence among the countries suggests that WAMZ is far from ready for a monetary union. The relatively low pass-through in some of the countries suggests rigidity in the banking system which may be due to underdevelopment of the system. Thus efforts geared toward strengthening the banking system and the financial system as whole would further enhance the prospect of a monetary union among them...|$|R
