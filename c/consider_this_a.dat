25|$|From this view, {{rather than}} {{concepts}} such as assertiveness, aggression, violence and criminal violence existing as distinct constructs, they exist instead along a continuum with moderate levels of aggression being most adaptive. Such scholars do not <b>consider</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> trivial difference, noting that many traditional researchers' aggression measurements may measure outcomes lower down in the continuum, at levels which are adaptive, yet they generalize their findings to non-adaptive levels of aggression, thus losing precision.|$|E

The pair escape City 17 via an evacuation train as the Citadel core goes critical, sending out the Combine message. The resulting shockwave derails their train.|$|E
25|$|Peaches are {{considered}} self-fertile because a commercial crop {{can be produced}} without cross-pollination, though cross-pollination usually gives a better crop. Apples {{are considered}} self-incompatible, because a commercial crop must be cross-pollinated. Many commercial fruit tree varieties are grafted clones, genetically identical. An orchard block of apples of one variety is genetically a single plant. Many growers now <b>consider</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> mistake. One means of correcting this mistake is to graft a limb of an appropriate pollenizer (generally a variety of crabapple) every six trees or so.|$|E

25|$|Kabbalah {{continued}} to be central to Haredi Orthodox Judaism, which generally rejected philosophy, although the Chabad strain of Chasidism showed a more positive attitude towards philosophy. Meanwhile, non-Orthodox Jewish thought in the latter 20th century saw resurgent interest in Kabbalah. In academic studies, Gershom Scholem began the critical investigation of Jewish mysticism, while in non-Orthodox Jewish denominations, Jewish Renewal and Neo-Hasidism, spiritualised worship. Many philosophers do not <b>consider</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> form of philosophy, as Kabbalah {{is a collection of}} esoteric methods of textual interpretation. Mysticism is generally understood as an alternative to philosophy, not a variant of philosophy.|$|E
25|$|In {{keeping with}} the central belief of Wahdat Al-Mawjud the Bektashi see reality {{contained}} in Haqq-Muhammad-Ali, a single unified entity. Bektashi do not <b>consider</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> form of trinity. There are many other practices and ceremonies that share similarity with other faiths, such as a ritual meal (muhabbet) and yearly confession of sins to a baba (magfirat-i zunub مغفرة الذنوب). Bektashis base their practices and rituals on their non-orthodox and mystical interpretation {{and understanding of the}} Qur'an and the prophetic practice (Sunnah). They have no written doctrine specific to them, thus rules and rituals may differ depending on under whose influence one has been taught. Bektashis generally revere Sufi mystics outside of their own order, such as Ibn Arabi, Al-Ghazali and Jelalludin Rumi who are close in spirit to them.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} of the early texts suggests that he was born as Siddhārtha Gautama in Lumbini {{and grew up in}} Kapilavasthu, a town in the plains region of the modern Nepal-India border, and that he spent his life in what is now modern Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Some hagiographic legends state that his father was a king named Suddhodana, his mother was queen Maya, and he was born in Lumbini gardens. However, scholars such as Richard Gombrich <b>consider</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> dubious claim because a combination of evidence suggests he was born in the Shakyas community – one that later gave him the title Shakyamuni, and the Shakya community was governed by a small oligarchy or republic-like council where there were no ranks but where seniority mattered instead. Some of the stories about Buddha, his life, his teachings, and claims about the society he grew up in may have been invented and interpolated at a later time into the Buddhist texts.|$|E

25|$|In 1907, Lafferty took a {{case that}} would define {{the rest of his}} career: {{representing}} 18 western Oregon counties against the Oregon and California Railroad to claim timber revenue from, and possession of, the O lands formerly granted to the railroad by the U.S. government. In 1870, the United States government had granted the railroad three million acres (12,000km²) of land to build a line from Portland south to California. The railroad was to sell land to settlers at $2.50 an acre, but widespread abuse resulted in developers, aided by politicians, acquiring large parcels through fraudulent means in {{what became known as the}} Oregon land fraud scandal. Then in 1903, the Southern Pacific Railroad, which had acquired the O, had stopped selling the parcels altogether. Lafferty fought the case for years and in 1915, it ended when the U.S. government took back control of the land, paying the railroad $2.50 per acre for the land. Lafferty did not <b>consider</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> victory since the railroad was compensated and the state of Oregon did not get possession of the land.|$|E
25|$|In Justice League of America (vol. 2) #21, Luthor {{can be seen}} {{associating with}} Libra's Secret Society of Super Villains and placed in its Inner Circle. Lex Luthor wanted Libra to prove himself, so Libra sends Clayface {{to blow up the}} Daily Planet building. As Lex Luthor {{attempts}} to ambush Libra after learning that he is a prophet of Darkseid, Lex Luthor soon ends up surrounded by Justifiers. Libra tells Lex Luthor to make a final choice... swear an oath to Darkseid or become a mindless slave. In Final Crisis #5, Lex Luthor is seen when Libra blames Calculator for cracking the computer codes that will help the resistance. Lex Luthor is silent on the matter, but has been picked to lead the rearguard action against the heroes at Blüdhaven. He assumes it's an honor, but he doesn't look very pleased. Libra later figures out Luthor had been the mole in the Society of Super Villains. Luthor, in league with Doctor Sivana, seemingly destroys Libra and overturns the Anti-Life Equation being broadcast into the Justifiers' helmets. He subsequently assists Superman in leading the assault against Darkseid's forces, noting that Superman can <b>consider</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> legendary first team-up between 'good' and 'bad'- with Luthor's side taking the credit for the win-, Superman accepting the deal due to the stakes. Luthor later assists Superman and his remaining allies in constructing the new Miracle Machine to reset the universe and recreate the universe without Darkseid.|$|E
500|$|However, {{later that}} year, Rome {{dispatched}} a military force under praetorian authority {{to put down}} the rebellion. A Roman praetor, Gaius Claudius Glaber, gathered a force of 3,000 men, not regular legions, but a militia [...] "picked up in haste and at random, for the Romans did not <b>consider</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> war yet, but a raid, something like an attack of robbery." [...] Glaber's forces besieged the slaves on Mount Vesuvius, blocking the only known way down the mountain.

AsbelGrants at Jeuxvideo.com called Ace Attorney Investigations 2 the best entry in the series, saying that the plot and characters were the game's highlights, keeping the player in suspense until the end. They found the first episode surprisingly strong, as it was a [...] "long and exciting case" [...] compared to other Ace Attorney games' tutorial-like first episodes.

500|$|Swanson did not <b>consider</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> Ripper case, {{and instead}} {{suggested}} {{a link to}} similar dismembered body cases in Rainham and Chelsea, {{as well as the}} [...] "Whitehall Mystery".

Links between these and three further murders—the [...] "Battersea Mystery" [...] of 1873 and 1874, in which two women were found dismembered, and the 1884 [...] "Tottenham Court Road Mystery"—have also been postulated. Experts on the murders—colloquially known as [...] "Ripperologists"—such as Stewart Evans, Keith Skinner, Martin Fido, and Donald Rumbelow, discount any connection between the torso and Ripper killings {{on the basis of their}} different modi operandi.|$|E
500|$|As a consequence, Russell was {{extremely}} sensitive to all racial prejudice: according to Taylor, he often perceived insults even if others did not. He {{was active in}} the Black Power movement and supported Muhammad Ali's decision to refuse to be drafted. He was often called [...] "Felton X", presumably {{in the tradition of the}} Nation of Islam's practice of replacing a European slave name with an [...] "X", and even purchased land in Liberia. Russell's public statements became increasingly militant, so far that he was quoted in a 1963 Sports Illustrated interview with the words: [...] "I dislike most white people because they are people... I like most blacks because I am black"; however, Russell articulated these views with a measure of self-criticism: [...] "I <b>consider</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> deficiency in myself—maybe. If I looked at it objectively, detached myself, it would be a deficiency." [...] However, when his white Celtics teammate Frank Ramsey asked whether he hated him, Russell claimed to be misquoted, but few believed it.|$|E

A total of three flights were made; there was an earlier rehearsal flight for reception purposes. In addition to the instruments for the band, the plane also carried a small piano. Because the stand-held microphones were not very useful on the plane, hand-held mikes were then used, but due to the cabin pressure, they became extremely heavy to hold after a few minutes.
