5|$|Crocodilians are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that are}} at their most dangerous in water and {{at the edge of}} water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey as big as or bigger than humans. The species on which there is most data are the saltwater <b>crocodile,</b> the Nile <b>crocodile,</b> and the American alligator. Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the black caiman, the Morelet's <b>crocodile,</b> the mugger <b>crocodile,</b> the American <b>crocodile,</b> the gharial, and the freshwater <b>crocodile.</b>|$|E
5|$|The New Guinea <b>crocodile</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by the American herpetologist Karl Patterson Schmidt in 1928 as Crocodylus novaeguineae. At one time {{it was thought that}} there were two subspecies, C. n. novaeguineae, the New Guinea <b>crocodile</b> native to Papua New Guinea and Western New Guinea, and C. n. mindorensis, the Philippine <b>crocodile,</b> native to several islands including Busuanga, Luzon, Masbate, Mindoro, Negros, Samar and Mindanao. Most authorities now consider that the Philippine <b>crocodile</b> is an entirely separate species. DNA sequencing data reported in 2011 showed that the Philippine <b>crocodile</b> is, in part, paraphyletic with regard to the New Guinea <b>crocodile,</b> and that the latter may constitutes a population within the Philippine <b>crocodile.</b> Among their two samples for the New Guinea <b>crocodile,</b> one was part of the Philippine <b>crocodile</b> clade and the other was separate, estimated to have diverged 2.6â€“6.8 million years ago. Both samples were taken from captives (could potentially be misidentified or hybrids) and the result should therefore be treated with caution.|$|E

5|$|King Rufus, {{the leader}} of a furry race of creatures called the Gobbos, is {{watching}} the sunrise over Gobbo Valley when he sees a large, woven basket carrying a baby <b>crocodile</b> floating down the river. Initially suspicious of the young <b>crocodile</b> but ultimately won over by its innocence, King Rufus and the Gobbos decide to raise it as one of their own and teach it in the ways of the Gobbo. The <b>crocodile,</b> named Croc, grows, eventually becoming much larger than the Gobbos.|$|E
25|$|On June 20, 2006 several Nile <b>crocodiles</b> hatched for {{the first}} time in the zoo's history. Two of these new <b>crocodiles</b> grew up in the zoo and are now among the five Nile <b>crocodiles</b> at Zoo Basel.|$|R
40|$|The {{apparent}} {{decline in}} the number of Nile <b>crocodiles</b> present in the Loskop Dam prompted a study to determine the number, size and distribution of Nile <b>crocodiles</b> now present in the reservoir. The number of <b>crocodiles</b> in the Loskop Dam was surveyed using aerial counts and spotlight counts. Surveys revealed the presence of a very low total number of <b>crocodiles</b> and also a poor distribution of <b>crocodiles</b> in the different size classes over almost 30 years since 1981. Eight surveys carried out between 2001 and 2010 revealed that the distribution pattern of <b>crocodiles</b> in the Loskop Dam did not vary between winter and summer. These distribution patterns indicate that <b>crocodiles</b> occur most frequently in the eastern and western inlets and not in the main basin of the dam. Thirteen <b>crocodiles</b> were re-introduced into the dam during March 2007; however the August 2009 spotlight survey results indicated that none of these animals had survived...|$|R

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American <b>crocodile,</b> which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American <b>crocodile.</b> In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E

50|$|Dwarf <b>crocodiles</b> {{live from}} {{lowlands}} to mid-altitude in streams, small rivers, swamps, pools and mangrove, but generally avoid main sections of large rivers. Most of their range is within forested regions, {{but it may}} extend into more open regions where the streams or river are well-shaded. Unlike most <b>crocodiles,</b> dwarf <b>crocodiles</b> only rarely bask in the sun. During the night they may move some distance from water on land. Reports exist of dwarf <b>crocodiles</b> in isolated pools in the savannah. Dwarf <b>crocodiles</b> living long-term in caves are known from western Gabon.|$|R

5|$|The park's {{margins are}} habitat for the {{threatened}} American <b>crocodile.</b> The construction {{of miles of}} cooling water canals in the marl lands close to the shore behind the Turkey Point power plant, and the canals' warm waters, have provided a nearly ideal environment for <b>crocodile</b> nesting, making the power plant a nursery for many of those living in the park. Although crocodiles and American alligators both occur in extreme southern Florida, alligators are uncommon in Biscayne, since alligators mainly inhabit fresh waters found farther inland, while crocodiles can live in Biscayne's somewhat saltier estuarine waters.|$|E

25|$|Chemoreception in <b>crocodiles</b> is {{especially}} interesting because they hunt in both terrestrial and aquatic surroundings. <b>Crocodiles</b> {{have only one}} olfactory chamber and the vomeronasal organ is absent in the adults indicating all olfactory perception {{is limited to the}} olfactory system. Behavioural and olfactometer experiments indicate that <b>crocodiles</b> detect both air-borne and water-soluble chemicals and use their olfactory system for hunting. When above water, <b>crocodiles</b> enhance their ability to detect volatile odorants by gular pumping, a rhythmic movement of the floor of the pharynx. <b>Crocodiles</b> close their nostrils when submerged, so olfaction underwater is unlikely. Underwater food detection is presumably gustatory and tactile.|$|R
50|$|The largest wild {{breeding}} {{population of}} <b>crocodiles</b> in South India {{live in the}} reservoir, and in the Chinnar, Thennar and Pambar rivers that drain into it. These broad-snouted mugger <b>crocodiles,</b> also known as marsh <b>crocodiles</b> and Persian <b>crocodiles,</b> {{are the most common}} and widespread of the three species of <b>crocodiles</b> found in India. They eat fish, other reptiles, small and large mammals and are sometimes dangerous to humans. Their total wild population here is currently estimated to be 60 adults and 37 sub-adults. Other fish predators here include: Oriental small-clawed otters, Indian cormorants and Indian flap-shelled turtles.|$|R
50|$|The <b>crocodiles</b> at Paga {{are very}} friendly. Visitors can sit, touch and take {{photographs}} with the <b>crocodiles.</b> They <b>crocodiles</b> roam freely throughout the ponds, and {{are brought to}} the shore when the guides whistle loudly. Tourists can then take photographs while holding the <b>crocodile's</b> tails, after the guide has fed them a chicken. There are concerns that the pond is now too reliant on tourism, with caretaker Salifu Awewozem saying in 2009 that the elderly <b>crocodiles</b> require specialist care, and the only time additional food is provided to the reptiles is when tourists pay for the chickens when they pose for photographs.|$|R

5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} they look? The <b>crocodile</b> etc. {{obviously}} used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in a <b>crocodile</b> suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E

50|$|The {{most recent}} common {{ancestor}} of duck and <b>crocodiles</b> is {{the base of}} the Archosauria clade, and was probably superficially similar to modern <b>crocodiles.</b> No fossil of this common ancestor are known to exist, but groups such as Phytosauria and Proterochampsia are near to {{the base of the}} archosaur clade. Although the phylogenetic distance from these groups to ducks and <b>crocodiles</b> are equal, in form and likely behaviour they are more similar to <b>crocodiles.</b>|$|R
2500|$|<b>Crocodiles</b> possess some {{advanced}} cognitive abilities. They {{can observe}} and use patterns of prey behaviour, {{such as when}} prey come to the river to drink {{at the same time}} each day. Vladimir Dinets of the University of Tennessee, observed that <b>crocodiles</b> use twigs as bait for birds looking for nesting material. They place sticks on their snouts and partly submerge themselves. [...] When the birds swooped in to get the sticks, the <b>crocodiles</b> then catch the birds. <b>Crocodiles</b> only do this in spring nesting seasons of the birds, when there is high demand for sticks to be used for building nests. Vladimir also discovered other similar observations from various scientists, some dating back to the 19th century. Aside from using sticks, <b>crocodiles</b> are also capable of cooperative hunting. Large numbers of <b>crocodiles</b> swim in circles to trap fish and take turns snatching them. In hunting larger prey, <b>crocodiles</b> swarm in, with one holding the prey down as the others rip it apart.|$|R
