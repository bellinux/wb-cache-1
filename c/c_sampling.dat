5000|$|When {{comparing}} the two samples, one {{should note that}} there are a number of differences between the two approaches that are not directly related to the support of first-class functions. The Haskell sample operates on lists, while the <b>C</b> <b>sample</b> operates on arrays.

This also accounts for the fact that the C function needs an additional parameter (giving the size of the array.)

The Haskell sample uses recursion to traverse the list, while the <b>C</b> <b>sample</b> uses iteration.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Radiocarbon is an {{exceptionally}} useful tool for studying soil-respired CO 2, providing information about soil carbon turnover rates, depths of production, and the biological sources of production through partitioning. Unfortunately, lit-tle {{work has been}} done to thoroughly investigate the possibility of inherent biases present in current measurement techniques, like those present in δ 13 CO 2 methodologies, caused by disturbances to the soil’s natural diffusive regime. This study investi-gates the degree of bias present in four 14 <b>C</b> <b>sampling</b> chamber methods using a three-dimensional numerical soil-atmosphere CO 2 diffusion model. The four chambers were tested in an idealized, surrogate reality by assessing measurement bias with varying Δ 14 C and δ 13 C signatures of production, collar lengths, soil biological productivity rates, and soil diffusivities. The static and Iso-FD chambers showed almost no isotopic measurement bias, significantly outperforming dynamic chambers, which demonstrated biases up to 200 ‰ in some modeled scenarios. The study also showed that 13 C and 14 C diffusive frac-tionation are not a constant multiple of one another, but that the δ 13 C correction still works in diffusive scenarios because the change in fractionation is not large enough to impact measured Δ 14 C values during chamber equilibration...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} prehistoric subsistence and {{the development}} of plant husbandry in northeastern Tohoku (northern Honshu). Archaeobotanical sampling was carried out at two sites in eastern Aomori Prefecture. Tominosawa is a Middle Jomon village site which produced a spectrum of nut and weedy plant species similar to that recovered from contemporary sites in southwestern Hokkaido. At the Kazahari site, pithouses from two phases of occupation were sampled for archaeobotanical remains: Tokoshinai IV (c. 1000 B. C.) and Fukurashima (c. 150 B. C.). The pithouse deposits produced evidence for Late Jomon rice, foxtail millet, and broomcorn millet dating to the first millennium B. <b>C.</b> <b>Sampling</b> of later Fukurashima contexts produced evidence of rice, foxtail and broomcorn millet, Japanese barnyard millet, and hemp. These data demonstrate that rice and millets have been present in northeastern Tohoku since c. 1000 B. C., and that farming systems were in place during later Fukurashima occupations. Ecological and ethnographic evidence is used to postulate that plant husbandry was possible in the area during Tokoshinai IV. It is concluded that the northward dispersal of rice was more rapid than was previously thought, and consequently that this movement may not have been greatly affected by cultural and ecological constraints. In addition, rice cultivation dispersed into northeastern Japan independently of wet-paddy technology. KEYWORDS: Japan, Tohoku, Jomon, subsistence, cultivation...|$|E
