Johnson's No. 48 Chevrolet {{included}} an image of SpongeBob across the hood, and Busch's No. 5 Chevrolet featured Patrick Star. Johnson said, [...] "This sounds so cool I {{know there are a}} lot of families who will be excited that Lowe's is doing this. The great thing is there will be something for every type of race fan. Plus how <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> wrong with SpongeBob helping us out on the car?" ...|$|E
500|$|New Media {{consultants}} and scientists Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman aided {{in the production}} of the episode. They had worked on the series throughout the first season, with their role ranging from directly writing episodes to advising the others on scientific concepts. Whitman later explained that they [...] "come to us with questions: Is this possible? Where <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> with this? Then we go and read the very technical articles, or talk with scientists, and then translate that into the storytelling medium of our show." [...] For [...] "The Road Not Taken", he and Chiappetta were asked to again [...] "find a new and gruesome way to blow people up," [...] this time by rooting it in the concept of pyrokinesis. Chiappetta explained, [...] "They wanted to have someone spontaneously combust and burn up. So this is where we sort of leaned back into our mythology." ...|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "slash" [...] is also {{developing}} {{as a way}} {{to introduce}} topic shifts or follow-up statements. [...] "Slash" [...] can introduce a follow up statement, such as, [...] "I really love that hot dog place on Liberty Street. Slash <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> there tomorrow?" [...] It can also indicate a shift to an unrelated topic, as in [...] "JUST SAW ALEX! Slash I just chubbed on oatmeal raisin cookies at north quad and i miss you." [...] The new usage of [...] "slash" [...] appears most frequently in spoken conversation, though it can also appear in writing.|$|E

2500|$|On January 6, 2014, John Petrucci {{said that}} Dream Theater were already [...] "planting seeds for album No. 13". He commented: [...] "There are some song ideas and {{little things like}} that -- nothing really official, but the seeds just start to get planted. One {{of the great things}} about this career is that you have the {{opportunity}} every time to go in and start again with a blank slate and think, 'What can we do differently? How can we make this better? Where <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> from here?' Every album has a story, and to constantly have a fresh opportunity to do it is really satisfying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in {{the fall}} of 1877, with {{pressure}} from the Canadian government, the Mounted Police organized a meeting between General Alfred H. Terry of the U.S. Federal Army and Sitting Bull at Fort Walsh. Sitting Bull refused to meet General Terry. As Walsh tried to persuade Sitting Bull, one hundred Nez Perce arrived stricken after battle. This made Sitting Bull even less inclined to go; the arrival of the Nez Perce showed that the U.S. could not be trusted. “You [...] the Nez Perce wounded and bleeding. How <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> and talk to white men with blood on their hands.” With persistence, Walsh managed to convince Sitting Bull to go to the meeting. Nonetheless, the meeting was fruitless. Sitting Bull did not trust the United States and would not return.|$|E
2500|$|Adele later {{collaborated with}} famed {{musician}} and producer Dan Wilson to write [...] "Someone like You" [...] {{which was one}} of the final songs composed for the album. Prior to meeting with Wilson, Adele said she wrote some of the lyrics using her acoustic guitar. The two sat around the piano for two days and brainstormed various melodies and lyrics, and ultimately decided to keep the musical production sparse: [...] "We just wrote it on the piano and then we recorded it when it was written. It wasn't sort of like recording it and listening to it thinking 'where <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> next?' It was really old school." [...] During an interview with Billboard, Wilson stated that while writing the song, they wanted to make it as personal as possible. He added [...] "We didn't try to make it open-ended so it could apply to 'anybody.' We tried to make it as personal as possible. She may not have had a melodic hook or a specific lyrical idea, but she always knew what she wanted to say. She definitely had a master plan." [...] The song was recorded at Harmony Studios in West Hollywood, California with Wilson playing piano. Philip Allen engineered in the studio. The mixing was done by Tom Elmhirst and Dan Parry while the mastering was finished by Tom Coyne.|$|E
