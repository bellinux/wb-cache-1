40|$|Economy-wide scrap rates {{could be}} {{estimated}} if economy-wide original values {{of fixed assets}} and investment data were available, but they are not. Therefore, scrap rates are estimated based on subsets of the whole economy where the necessary data to do so are available. Scrap rates can be calculated from two independent combinations of the accounting identities presented in the paper. Depreciation-based scrap rates One way to calculate scrap rates is {{to make use of}} depreciation rates. With <b>cumulative</b> <b>depreciation</b> from equation (1) and depreciation from equation (5), scrap values (the original value of decommissioned fixed assets) follow in equation (4); scrap rates are obtained by inserting the scrap value in equation (3). Solving the four equations for the “depreciation-based ” scrap rate (and the unknown revaluation term) yields scrap ratet – (α * revaluationt / OFAt- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} three years since I last wrote on the UScurrent account deficit for CESifo Forum, based on data through 2003, when the US current account deficit (balance of {{payments}} basis) was $ 522 billion. I argued then that, contrary to frequent claims of unsustainability, the US deficit was likely to endure for many years. After 2003, the deficit grew annually, reaching $ 811 billion in 2006 before dropping below $ 800 billion in 2007, a response both to slower growth in the United States and to some <b>cumulative</b> <b>depreciation</b> of the dollar against other major cur-rencies – although prices of US oil imports were sig-nificantly higher in 2007 than in 2003. The dollar depreciated in 2003 and 2004, but actually appreciat-ed in 2005 before resuming depreciation in 2006 / 07. In the meantime {{there have been numerous}} article...|$|E
40|$|The {{choice of}} {{depreciation}} method from among straight-line and accelerated methods {{can have a}} significant impact on the present value of expected tax payments. This is a problem that has been studied for decades, with most results indicating the optimality of accelerated methods. Recent research questions this claim by relaxing the assumption of positive taxable income. The situation where net-operating losses may be carried-forward and backward in time is the subject of this paper. We model this situation and establish conditions that allow straight-line depreciation to be preferred over accelerated methods. The results are focused around a threshold number of periods of consecutive losses, which are determined by the allowable periods to carry a loss forward. For consecutive losses beyond this threshold, straight-line will always be optimal. When the <b>cumulative</b> <b>depreciation</b> charges up to and including the window are guaranteed to be applied on or before the threshold period, then straight-line will never be optimal.

40|$|This Selected Issues {{paper on}} the Arab Republic of Egypt {{examines}} the dynamic relationship between the nominal exchange rate and prices during Egypt’s exit from a managed exchange rate regime. The exit from the peg went through several phases, including a series of step devaluations between 2000 and 2002, a first attempt at a float in January 2003, and the successful transition to a unified, flexible exchange rate system in late- 2004. From 2000 to 2004, the Egyptian pound experienced a <b>cumulative</b> <b>depreciation</b> of 68 percent against the U. S. dollar.

30|$|This {{paper was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the volatility and conditional relationship among inflation rates, exchange rates and interest rates {{as well as to}} construct a model using multivariate GARCH DCC and BEKK models using Ghana data from January 1990 to December 2013. The study revealed that the <b>cumulative</b> <b>depreciation</b> of the cedi to the US dollar from 1990 to 2013 is 7, 010.2 % and the yearly weighted depreciation of the cedi to the US dollar for the period is 20.4 %. There was evidence that, the fact that inflation rate was stable, does not mean that exchange rates and interest rates are expected to be stable. Rather, when the cedi performs well on the forex, inflation rates and interest rates react positively and become stable in the long run. The BEKK model is robust to modelling and forecasting volatility of inflation rates, exchange rates and interest rates. The DCC model is robust to model the conditional and unconditional correlation among inflation rates, exchange rates and interest rates. The BEKK model, which forecasted high exchange rate volatility for the year 2014, is very robust for modelling the exchange rates in Ghana. The mean equation of the DCC model is also robust to forecast inflation rates in Ghana.|$|E
