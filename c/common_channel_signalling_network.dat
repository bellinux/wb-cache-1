40|$|Signalling is the {{critical}} component of telecommunications networks. Thus {{the design of the}} signalling system is a fundamental issue for the creation of the future Broadband ISDN out of ATM switching technology. Today 2 ̆ 7 s telecommunication <b>networks</b> use <b>common</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signalling</b> <b>networks</b> (standardised in SS 7) which are often separate from the bearer or transport network. With an ATM based Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN), it is anticipated that both signalHng and user traffic will share the underlying ATM layer. An SS 7 2 ̆ 2 Message Transfer Part 2 ̆ 2 (MTP) provides reliable connectionless signalling message transport. However due to differences between SS 7 links and ATM signalling links (i. e. ATM Virtual Channel Connections (VCCs)), a new MTP will be needed for B-ISDN. This thesis is concerned with the design and engineering of the B-ISDN MTP The need for an ATM signalling link error monitor is identified as a key requirement. To design such an error monitor, the delay performance of ATM signalling links during errored periods must be determined. This requires a model for the delay performance of the Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP), the link level protocol to be used on ATM signalling links. The thesis presents an SSCOP delay model, which also gives general results for mean Selective Repeat transmitter delay and the mean (and distribution) of Selective Repeat receiver delay...|$|R

This paper investigates the dynamics of the national option with congestion priorities (NOCP) and international option (IO) congestion control strategies, when they are implemented in a CCS network during a period of signalling transfer point (STP) processor overload. In addition, we study the success of a combined control (CC) which incorporates both the NOCP and IO. We find (1) IO performs well under all the situations studied, and (2) the NOCP performs well in most cases, but is sensitive to the setting of congestion thresholds.

The primary function of SS 7 is to provide call control, remote network management, and maintenance capabilities for the inter- office telephone network. SS 7 performs these functions by exchanging control messages between SS 7 telephone exchanges (signaling points or SPs) and SS 7 signaling transfer points (STPs). The switching offices (SPs) handle the SS 7 control network as well as the user circuit switched network.
