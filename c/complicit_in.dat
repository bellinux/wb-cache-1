5|$|In 1967 Olivier {{was caught}} in the middle of a {{confrontation}} between Chandos and Tynan over the latter's proposal to stage Rolf Hochhuth's Soldiers. As the play speculatively depicted Churchill as <b>complicit</b> <b>in</b> the assassination of the Polish prime minister Władysław Sikorski, Chandos regarded it as indefensible. At his urging the board unanimously vetoed the production. Tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management's artistic freedom, but Olivier himself stayed firmly in place, and Tynan also remained. At about this time Olivier began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses. He was treated for prostate cancer and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov's Three Sisters he was hospitalised with pneumonia. He recovered enough to take the heavy role of Edgar in Strindberg's The Dance of Death, the finest of all his performances other than in Shakespeare, in Gielgud's view.|$|E

Her second book in the trilogy, The Daydreaming Boy (2004), which earned her the 2004 Lannan Literary Fellowship as well as the 2005 PEN/USA Award for Fiction, is centered on a middle-aged survivor of the genocide living in a 1960s Beirut which itself is facing collapse.

5|$|In 2014 and 2015 several {{incidents}} involving worker mistreatment surfaced, {{indicating that}} employment agencies often neglect workers' rights or are <b>complicit</b> <b>in</b> {{the cycle of}} abuse; {{there have also been}} many instances of failure to provide service to employers. According to media reports, between 2009 and 2012 the Consumer Council in Hong Kong received nearly 800 complaints about agencies.

The 2015 death of Elis Kurniasih, awaiting her work visa before beginning employment, exposed grey areas and legal loopholes in the Employment Agency Regulations; Kurniasih was crushed to death by falling masonry at an agency boarding house in North Point. Worker protections against illegal fees, unsanitary accommodations and lack of insurance were criticised as inadequate.|$|E
5|$|Ljotić {{returned}} from Paris on 1 September 1914, and rejoined the Serbian Army. He attained {{the rank of}} corporal by year's end and was wounded during the Ovče Pole Offensive. During the winter of 1915–16, he participated in the Serbian Army's retreat through Albania. Ljotić remained on active service after the war ended, with a unit guarding {{the border between the}} newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and the Kingdom of Italy near the town of Bakar. During this time, he also worked for the intelligence service of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In 1919, he helped break a railway strike meant to disrupt the flow of munitions intended for anti-Communist forces fighting against Béla Kun in Hungary. In 1920, he ordered troops under his command to arrest striking railway workers, convinced that all were <b>complicit</b> <b>in</b> a Communist conspiracy. Ljotić was demobilized on 17 June 1920. He subsequently married Ivka Mavrinac, a Roman Catholic Croat from the village of Krasica on the Croatian Littoral. The couple had two sons, Vladimir and Nikola, and a daughter, Ljubica. Ljotić and his wife relocated to Belgrade not long after their marriage. Ljotić passed his bar examination on 22 September 1921, and began practicing law. He later became vice-president of the diocesan council of the Serbian Orthodox Church in the town of Požarevac, and represented the Požarevac diocese in the church's patriarchal council.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Stalingrad, Khrushchev {{met with}} {{personal}} tragedy, {{as his son}} Leonid, a fighter pilot, was apparently shot down and killed in action on 11 March 1943. The circumstances of Leonid's death remain obscure and controversial, as none of his fellow fliers stated that they witnessed him being shot down, nor was his plane found or body recovered. As a result, Leonid's fate {{has been the subject}} of considerable speculation. One theory has Leonid surviving the crash and collaborating with the Germans, and when he was recaptured by the Soviets, Stalin ordering him shot despite Nikita Khrushchev pleading for his life. This supposed killing is used to explain why Khrushchev later denounced Stalin in the Secret Speech. While there is no supporting evidence for this account in Soviet files, some historians allege that Leonid Khrushchev's file was tampered with after the war. In later years, Leonid Khrushchev's wingmate stated that he saw his plane disintegrate, but did not report it. Khrushchev biographer Taubman speculates that this omission was most likely to avoid the possibility of being seen as <b>complicit</b> <b>in</b> the death of the son of a Politburo member. In mid-1943, Leonid's wife, Liuba Khrushcheva, was arrested on accusations of spying and sentenced to five years in a labor camp, and her son (by another relationship), Tolya, was placed in a series of orphanages. Leonid's daughter, Yulia, was raised by Nikita Khrushchev and his wife.|$|E
40|$|We {{continue}} to be fascinated by Western readings of India. Once the debates were about Indomania versus Indophobia, then it became a question of colonial dispatches and what they said about British rule, and finally, after further refinements of historical themes (Eric Stokes’s work is exemplary here) the interest moved to questions of representation. Postcolonial theory has, in turn, brought to our readings of India alternative ways of exploring adversarial as well as <b>complicit</b> moments <b>in</b> the creation of Empire. The books I have before me are recent attempts {{to tell the story}} of India (or to speak about Indian encounters) that combine scholarship with a high level of self-consciousness about cultural sensibilities and the position from which one speaks about the "other. ...|$|R
40|$|From a {{security}} perspective, the major worry is not catastrophic failure, since a communications device that shuts down can’t leak classified information. Rather, {{the focus is}} on checking for silent failures, which compro-mise the device’s security function in some way not obvi-ous to its operator. A communications device in an extremely sensitive environment, such as a government or military network, could therefore contain elaborate mechanisms to check that the device is working securely. Unfortunately, these elaborate mechanisms often come with their own set of security problems. Assessing the consequences of an individual failure is a tedious but straightforward process. The problem gets exponentially more complicated when the task is to identify <b>complicit</b> faults, <b>in</b> which two or more (possi-bly silent) failures that are harmless individually com-bine to create an insecure situation. For example, a device with 15 security-critical components—a simplis-tic case—has 32, 767 component groups that could result <b>in</b> <b>complicit</b> faults. Evaluating this many alternatives rapidly becomes impractical. What makes the conjunction of silent and complicit failures so dangerous is that an undetected silent fault can lie dormant until it becomes part of a complicit fault. Even if individual component failures occur rarely, this greatly increases the likelihood of multiple simultaneous failures. Moreover, every communications device is different, and the quality of each information security evaluation ulti-mately relies on the evaluator’s skills and experience. Communications devices for government or military applications must keep data secure, even when their electronic components fail. Combining information flow and risk analyses could make fault-mode evaluations for such devices more efficient and cost-effective...|$|R

5|$|Three Hieronymite friars, Luis de Figueroa, Bernardino de Manzanedo and Alonso de Santo Domingo, were {{selected}} as commissioners {{to take over}} the authority of the Indies. Las Casas had a considerable part in selecting them and writing the instructions under which their new government would be instated, largely based on Las Casas's memorial. Las Casas himself was granted the official title of Protector of the Indians, and given a yearly salary of one hundred pesos. In this new office Las Casas was expected to serve as an advisor to the new governors with regard to Indian issues, to speak the case of the Indians in court and send reports back to Spain. Las Casas and the commissioners traveled to Santo Domingo on separate ships, and Las Casas arrived two weeks later than the Hieronimytes. During this time the Hieronimytes had time to form a more pragmatic view of the situation than the one advocated by Las Casas; their position was precarious as every encomendero on the Islands was fiercely against any attempts to curtail their use of native labour. Consequently, the commissioners were unable to take any radical steps towards improving the situation of the natives. They did revoke some encomiendas from Spaniards, especially those who were living in Spain and not on the islands themselves; they even repossessed the encomienda of Fonseca, the Bishop of Burgos. They also carried out an inquiry into the Indian question at which all the encomenderos asserted that the Indians were quite incapable of living freely without their supervision. Las Casas was disappointed and infuriated. When he accused the Hieronymites of being <b>complicit</b> <b>in</b> kidnapping Indians, the relationship between Las Casas and the commissioners broke down. Las Casas had become a hated figure by Spaniards all over the Islands, and he had to seek refuge in the Dominican monastery. The Dominicans had been the first to indict the encomenderos, and they continued to chastise them and refuse the absolution of confession to slave owners, and even stated that priests who took their confession were committing a mortal sin. In May 1517, Las Casas was forced to travel back to Spain to denounce to the regent the failure of the Hieronymite reforms. Only after Las Casas had left did the Hieronymites begin to congregate Indians into towns similar to what Las Casas had wanted.|$|E

The hegemonic femininity embodied by a Ms. White Wealthy Beautiful (the thus labeled “Bai Fu Mei”), for instance, has left indelible imprints on both selling and consuming cosmetic surgical procedures. Remapping intertwined class and gender codes on the female body, cosmetic surgery has paradoxically brought about the promise of upward class mobility and the predicament of regressive gender mandate. Whereas neoliberal social transformation and evolving gender politics foment new configurations of Chinese femininity, I further posit that consumers of cosmetic surgery play a complex, <b>complicit</b> role <b>in</b> constructing oppressive subtexts of feminine normalcy, which reinscribes cultural control over the female body...|$|R
