Several genome-wide studies have {{identified a number of}} loci as significantly linked to idiopathic scoliosis. In 2006 idiopathic scoliosis was linked with three microsatellite polymorphisms in the MATN1 gene (encoding for Matrilin 1, cartilage matrix protein). Fifty-three single nucleotide polymorphism markers in the DNA that are significantly associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were identified through a genome-wide association study.|$|E
25|$|The cloning of {{the human}} MYBPC3 cDNA and {{localization}} of the gene on human chromosome 11p11.2 has assisted the structure and function of cMyBP-C. MYBPC3 became therefore the “best” <b>candidate</b> <b>gene</b> for the CMH4 locus for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that was initially mapped by the group of Schwartz. MYBPC3 mutations segregating in families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been identified. MYBPC3 was thus the fourth gene for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, following MYH7, encoding β-myosin heavy chain, TNNT2 and TPM1, encoding cardiac troponin T and α-tropomyosin, respectively, earmarking hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as a disease of the sarcomere.|$|E

40|$|Predicting <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> using gene {{expression}} profiles and unbiased protein-protein interactions (PPI) contributes {{a lot in}} deciphering the pathogenesis of complex diseases. Recent studies showed that there are significant disparities in network topological features between non-disease and disease genes in protein-protein interaction settings. Integrated methods could consider their characteristics comprehensively in a biological network. In this study, we introduce a novel computational method, based on combined network topological features, to construct a combined classifier and then use it to predict <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> for coronary artery diseases (CAD). As a result, 276 novel <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> were predicted and were found to share similar functions to known disease genes.

40|$|Multiple factors {{underlie}} {{susceptibility to}} essential hypertension, including a significant genetic and ethnic component, and environmental effects. Blood pressure response of hypertensive individuals to salt is heterogeneous, but salt sensitivity appears {{more prevalent in}} people of indigenous African origin. The underlying genetics of salt-sensitive hypertension, however, are poorly understood. In this study, computational methods including text- and data-mining {{have been used to}} select and prioritize <b>candidate</b> aetiological <b>genes</b> for salt-sensitive hypertension. Additionally, we have compared allele frequencies and copy number variation for single nucleotide polymorphisms in <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> between indigenous Southern African and Caucasian populations, with the aim of identifying <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> with significant variability between the population groups: identifying genetic variability between population groups can exploit ethnic differences in disease prevalence to aid with prioritisation of good <b>candidate</b> <b>genes.</b> Our top-ranking <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> include parathyroid hormone precursor (PTH) and type- 1 angiotensin II receptor (AGTR 1).

25|$|Errors in the dbSNP can hamper <b>candidate</b> <b>gene</b> {{association}} {{studies and}} haplotype-based investigations. Errors may also increase false conclusions in association studies: {{increasing the number}} of SNPs that are tested by testing false SNPs requires more hypothesis tests. However, these false SNPs cannot actually be associated with traits, so the alpha level is decreased more than is necessary for a rigorous test if only the true SNPs were tested and the false negative rate will increase. Musemeci et al. (2010) suggested that authors of negative association studies inspect their previous studies for false SNPs (SNDs), which could be removed from analysis.|$|E
25|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) are {{a recently}} developed research method {{which are used}} to examine genetic associations with dependence, addiction, and drug use. These studies employ an unbiased approach to finding genetic associations with specific phenotypes and give equal weight to all regions of DNA, including those with no ostensible relationship to drug metabolism or response. These studies rarely identify genes from proteins previously described via animal knockout models and <b>candidate</b> <b>gene</b> analysis. Instead, large percentages of genes involved in processes such as cell adhesion are commonly identified. This {{is not to say}} that previous findings, or the GWAS findings, are erroneous. The important effects of endophenotypes are typically not capable of being captured by these methods. Furthermore, genes identified in GWAS for drug addiction may be involved either in adjusting brain behavior prior to drug experiences, subsequent to them, or both.|$|E
25|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) revealed {{regions of}} linkage {{that were found}} on most chromosomes. These studies are useful in identifying the genes that {{may be responsible for}} complex diseases such as SLE. <b>Candidate</b> <b>gene</b> loci implicated with SLE include multiple alleles from the HLA region, Fc-gamma receptor, and complement component system. However, association does not prove that a specific form of a gene is responsible for the disease, as there may be other polymorphisms in the region that have a greater association effect. However, because the biological role of most genes are not completely understood, {{it can be difficult to}} attribute phenotypic traits to certain genetic polymorphisms. Since SLE is associated with so many genetic regions, it is likely an oligogenic trait, meaning that there are several genes that control susceptibility to the disease. Further complicating our understanding is the association of certain linkages with various ethnic groups.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to predicate <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> in cervical cancer (CC) using a network-based strategy and to understand the pathogenic process of CC. Methods. A pathogenic network of CC was extracted based on known pathogenic genes (seed genes) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between CC and normal controls. Subsequently, cluster analysis was performed to identify the subnetworks in the pathogenic network using ClusterONE. Each gene in the pathogenic network was assigned a weight value, and then <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> were obtained based on the weight distribution. Eventually, pathway enrichment analysis for <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> was performed. Results. In this work, a total of 330 DEGs were identified between CC and normal controls. From the pathogenic network, 2 intensely connected clusters were extracted, {{and a total of}} 52 <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> were detected under the weight values greater than 0. 10. Among these <b>candidate</b> <b>genes,</b> VIM had the highest weight value. Moreover, <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> MMP 1, CDC 45, and CAT were, respectively, enriched in pathway in cancer, cell cycle, and methane metabolism. Conclusion. <b>Candidate</b> pathogenic <b>genes</b> including MMP 1, CDC 45, CAT, and VIM might be involved in the pathogenesis of CC.

Seventy-four <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> are identified in the 16 LAFBR regions, which encode receptor-like protein kinases, transcription factors, and other defense-related proteins.

25|$|Equine {{linkage group}} II {{includes}} {{a number of}} genes. The first linkage was found between a blood type marker and tobiano white spotting in 1978. The same blood type marker, albumin, was linked to another blood protein called vitamin D-binding protein. In 1982, a linkage grouping was proposed, including three genes for serum proteins, and three for coat color: tobiano spotting, chestnut, and roan. Research since equine linkage group II was defined has identified {{the exact location of}} the tobiano allele and the chestnut allele. The region of the chromosome that harbors the roan gene is homologous to parts of chromosomes in other species that also control coat color, even some similar to roan. Presently, the KIT gene is the primary <b>candidate</b> <b>gene</b> for roan. While a chromosomal inversion of KIT causes tobiano white spotting, KIT also harbors one or more alleles responsible for sabino spotting, no fewer than eleven alleles responsible for dominant white spotting, and is thought to be a major contributor to many other forms of less distinctive white markings.|$|E
2500|$|There may be {{additional}} forms not yet mapped. [...] However {{studies suggest}} that it {{is not part of the}} linkage group that includes roan and tobiano. The KIT gene is not thought to be a <b>candidate</b> <b>gene</b> for splashed white. Preliminary studies from the early part of the 20th century suggested that splashed white was the result of a recessive gene, however this is no longer believed to be the case. It is more likely that many splashed whites go unidentified, whether because their markings are too minimal to register as [...] "pinto" [...] with breeders, confusion with sabino, or the confounding effect of multiple white spotting patterns. [...] It seems therefore more likely that splashed white is the result of an [...] incomplete dominant gene, with homozygotes exhibiting more extensive white than heterozygotes. Just as the presence of additional white patterning genes can increase the amount of white, other genes may be responsible for restricting the expression of splash.|$|E
2500|$|Another current open {{question}} is whether genetic influences are important for the likeliness of co-twins {{to change in the}} same way over a period of time. A link was found between the personality trait of neuroticism and a polymorphism called 5-HTTLPR in the serotonin transporter gene, but this association was not replicated in larger studies. Other <b>candidate</b> <b>gene</b> studies have provided weak evidence that some personality traits are related to AVPR1A ("ruthlessness gene") and MAOA ("Warrior gene"). [...] Genotypes, or the genetic make up of an organism, influence but don't fully decide the physical traits of a person. Those are also influenced by the environment and behaviors they are surrounded by. For example, a person's height is affected by genetics, but if they are malnourished growth will be stunted no matter what their genetic coding says. [...] Environment is also not completely responsible for an outcome in personality. An example from Psychobiology of Personality by Marvin Zuckerman is alcoholism: [...] Studies suggest that alcoholism is an inherited disease, but if a subject with a strong biological background of alcoholism in their family tree is never exposed to alcohol, they will not be so inclined regardless of their genome.|$|E
40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) commonly accredited as "the great imitator" {{is a highly}} complex disease involving multiple gene susceptibility with non-specific symptoms.

40|$|Abstract Background Fetal alcohol {{syndrome}} (FAS) is {{a serious}} global health problem and is observed at high frequencies in certain South African communities. Although in utero alcohol exposure is the primary trigger, there is evidence for genetic- and other susceptibility factors in FAS development. No genome-wide association or linkage studies have been performed for FAS, making computational selection and -prioritization of <b>candidate</b> disease <b>genes</b> an attractive approach. Results 10174 <b>Candidate</b> <b>genes</b> were initially selected from the whole genome using a previously described method, which selects <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> according to their expression in disease-affected tissues. Hereafter candidates were prioritized for experimental investigation by investigating criteria pertinent to FAS and binary filtering. 29 Criteria were assessed by mining various database sources to populate criteria-specific <b>gene</b> lists. <b>Candidate</b> <b>genes</b> were then prioritized for experimental investigation using a binary system that assessed the criteria gene lists against the candidate list, and <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> were scored accordingly. A group of 87 genes was prioritized as candidates and for future experimental validation. The validity of the binary prioritization method was assessed by investigating the protein-protein interactions, functional enrichment and common promoter element binding sites of the top-ranked genes. Conclusion This analysis highlighted a list of strong <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> from the TGF-β, MAPK and Hedgehog signalling pathways, which are all integral to fetal development and potential targets for alcohol's teratogenic effect. We conclude that this novel bioinformatics approach effectively prioritizes credible <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> for further experimental analysis. </p...|$|R

40|$|Selective {{breeding}} programmes for desired phenotypes in animals {{provide a good}} resource for researchers to understand the genetic basis underlying those phenotypes. Most traits of economic importance in animals are quantitative traits, which are controlled by genetic as well as environmental factors. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the mapping of the genomic regions containing genetic factors, which control the diverse phenotypes in complex traits of interest, resulted in the successful identification of causative mutations. The same forward genetics approach, which endeavours to identify the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity, was followed in this study. To identify and functionally evaluate the mutations controlling diverse phenotypic differences between the High-weight and Low-weight chicken lines, the previously fine mapped interacting quantitative trait loci (QTL) for growth in chicken were scanned for the presence of genes. Gene databases (Ensembl, RefSeq) and gene prediction tools (Genscan and N-Scan) were used to reveal as many genes as possible. To identify <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> for growth, the conservation pattern of those genes was studied using the phastCons programme in the PHAST package. The genes most conserved in evolution were identified and selected for further analysis. The evidence based, well-supported and annotated Ensemble conserved genes were identified as <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> for growth in general. Gene ontology terms for the <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> were obtained from the Gene Ontology (GO) database to study the molecular and biological functions of those <b>candidate</b> <b>genes.</b> KEGG biological pathways were mapped for the presence of identified <b>candidate</b> <b>genes.</b> The <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> were found having roles in many biological pathways. The biological pathways that contained <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> from multiple interacting QTL were identified as candidate pathways.
