5|$|Any (lunatic) person found {{wandering}} {{at large}} or not under proper care and control <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> before two justices who could order the person's removal to an asylum. The police were usually responsible {{for bringing the}} person before the two justices.|$|E
5|$|A second {{access to}} the castle leads up from a rocky cove, the {{aperture}} to a marine cave on the northern side of the Dunnottar cliffs into which a small boat <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought.</b> From here a steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff top, which in turn offers {{access to the}} castle via the Water Gate in the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of earthworks, surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward. A small sentry box or guard house stands by the eastern battery, overlooking the coast.|$|E
5|$|As the Great Depression hit the United States, Fairbanks bucked {{the poor}} {{economic}} trend. Thanks to the Alaska Railroad, large gold dredges <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> in, and these returned the area's gold mines to profitability. In 1938, Lathrop {{took advantage of}} the good economic situation by reviving the Alaska Miner as a weekly supplement to the News-Miner. The Miner covered happenings in the gold-mining camps outside Fairbanks and was focused on areas outside the city. In 1939, Fairbanks radio station KFAR was founded, and it shared the Lathrop building with the News-Miner, which occupied the bottom floors of the building.|$|E

5|$|Mary Shelley {{believed}} in the Enlightenment idea that people could improve society through the responsible exercise of political power, but she feared that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to chaos. In practice, her works largely criticise the way 18th-century thinkers such as her parents believed such change <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> about. The creature in Frankenstein, for example, reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless. Shelley's works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft; she lacks faith in Godwin's theory that humanity could eventually be perfected.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the success of the {{offensive}} in this sector was the failure of Falkenhausen to employ a defence in depth. In theory, the enemy would be allowed to make initial gains, thus stretching their lines of communication. Reserves held close to the battlefield would be committed once the initial advance had bogged down, before enemy reinforcements <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> up. The defenders would thus be able to counter-attack and regain any lost territory. In this sector, Falkenhausen kept his reserve troops too far from the front and they were too late for a useful counter-attack on either 10 or 11 April.|$|E
5|$|The T30 HMC was {{originally}} conceived in 1941 as an interim design to fulfil the Armored Force's requirement for an assault gun to equip tank and armored reconnaissance units. The Ordnance Department design {{was based on}} the M3 Half-track in order that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> into service quickly. A prototype vehicle was authorized in October 1941 armed with an M1A1 75mm Pack Howitzer and a mount that was designed to fit on a simple box structure in the back of an M3 Half-track.|$|E

Hence he <b>could</b> never <b>be</b> {{acknowledged}} by the family; hence, too, the Lady Theodora's spotless purity (though the young people had <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> up together) <b>could</b> never <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> to own the relationship." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this time}} General Albert Sidney Johnston {{commanded}} all the Confederate troops {{west of the}} Alleghany Mountains, {{with the exception of}} those in the extreme south. On the National side the forces confronting him were divided into, at first three, then four separate departments. Johnston had greatly the advantage in having supreme command over all troops that <b>could</b> possibly <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> to bear upon one point, while the forces similarly situated on the National side, divided into independent commands, <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> into harmonious action except by orders from Washington.|$|R

5|$|The police {{acquired}} testimonies that Lord Arthur Somerset, an equerry to the Prince of Wales, was a patron. Both {{he and the}} brothel keeper, Charles Hammond, {{managed to}} flee abroad before a prosecution <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought.</b> The male prostitutes, who also worked as telegraph messenger boys for the Post Office, were given light sentences and no clients were prosecuted. After Henry James FitzRoy, Earl of Euston, was named in the press as a client, he successfully sued for libel.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Hipper {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven. After the routine maintenance was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The engine oil feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until the blaze <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper motionless for several hours on the open sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Wiesenthal {{dedicated}} most of {{his life}} to tracking down and gathering information on fugitive Nazi war criminals so that they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> to trial. In 1947 he co-founded the Jewish Historical Documentation Centre in Linz, Austria, where he and others gathered information for future war crime trials and aided refugees in their search for lost relatives. He opened the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime in Vienna in 1961 and continued to try to locate missing Nazi war criminals. He played a small role in locating Adolf Eichmann, who was captured in Buenos Aires in 1960, and worked closely with the Austrian justice ministry to prepare a dossier on Franz Stangl, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1971.|$|E
50|$|Rea's {{discovery}} of gold diadems is intriguing, for gold {{does not occur}} at Adichanallur or any nearby place. The gold <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> from outside because of trade contacts, Thirumoorthy said.|$|R

5|$|Assisted by {{a network}} of former SS members, Mengele sailed to Argentina in July 1949. He {{initially}} lived in and around Buenos Aires, then fled to Paraguay in 1959 and Brazil in 1960 while being sought by West Germany, Israel, and Nazi hunters such as Simon Wiesenthal so that he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> to trial. In spite of extradition requests by the West German government and clandestine operations by the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, Mengele eluded capture. He drowned while swimming off the Brazilian coast in 1979 and was buried under a false name. His remains were disinterred and positively identified by forensic examination in 1985.|$|E
5|$|During World War II the {{battalion}} {{was sent to}} New Guinea in 1942 {{as part of the}} 30th Brigade to defend the territory against a Japanese attack. Subsequently, between July and August of that year the unit was heavily engaged in the defence of Port Moresby, fighting along the Kokoda Track. The 39th fought several desperate actions against the Japanese as they attempted to hold out until further reinforcements <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> up from Port Moresby. They were also later involved in the fighting around Buna–Gona. Such was their involvement in the battle that {{by the time they were}} withdrawn they could only muster 32 men and following its return to Australia, the unit was disbanded in early July 1943.|$|E
5|$|In May 1960, Isser Harel, {{director}} of Mossad (the Israeli intelligence agency), personally led the successful effort to capture Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires. He hoped {{to track down}} Mengele as well so he too <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> to trial in Israel. Under interrogation, Eichmann provided the address of a boarding house {{that had been used}} as a safe house for Nazi fugitives. Surveillance of the house did not reveal Mengele or any members of his family, and the neighborhood postman said that although Mengele had recently been receiving letters there under his real name, he had since relocated, leaving no forwarding address. Harel's inquiries at a machine shop where Mengele had been part owner did not turn up any leads either, so he had to give up.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} Ionescu <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> back to Singapore for trial due to {{diplomatic}} immunity {{and the absence}} of an extradition treaty between Singapore and Romania has triggered much public outrage in Singapore.|$|R
5|$|Once the {{infantry}} {{had reached the}} German trenches, the artillery shifted from the creeping barrage to the standing barrage, a static barrage that would protect {{the infantry}} from counter-attack while they consolidated the position. A variant was the box barrage, in which three or four barrages formed a box—or more often three sides of a box—around a position to isolate and prevent reinforcements being brought up into the front line. This was normally used to protect trench raids, although {{it could also be}} used offensively against a German unit. Another type of barrage was the SOS barrage, fired in response to a German counterattack. An SOS barrage <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> down by firing a flare signal of a pre arranged colour, as a German barrage tended to cut the telephone lines. A pre-registered barrage would then descend on No Man's Land.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying was {{scheduled}} to consist of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. The first part of qualifying (Q1) was disrupted after a little more than five minutes, when Sainz crashed at turn four, bringing out red flags. Due to the prospect of worsening rain and the chance that qualifying <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> to an end by the weather at any point, the teams fought for grid positions early on, with Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and Daniel Ricciardo setting the fastest times. Apart from Sainz, both Manor Marussia drivers were eliminated, along with the two Sauber cars of Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr. Sebastian Vettel, after making contact with a barrier, finished Q1 in fifteenth place, barely making it into Q2.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Grand Port was a naval {{battle between}} squadrons of frigates from the French Navy and the British Royal Navy. The battle was fought during 20–27 August 1810 over {{possession}} of the harbour of Grand Port on Isle de France (now Mauritius) during the Napoleonic Wars. The British squadron of four frigates sought to blockade the port to prevent its use by the French through the capture of the fortified Île de la Passe at its entrance. This position was seized by a British landing party on 13 August, and when a French squadron under Captain Guy-Victor Duperré approached the bay nine days later the British commander, Captain Samuel Pym, decided to lure them into coastal waters where his superior numbers <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> to bear against the French ships.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Tom; his eagerness {{for justice}} on Maggie had diminished {{since he had}} seen clearly that it <b>could</b> hardly <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> about without the {{injustice}} of some blame on his own conduct.|$|R
50|$|In his 2002 book, Odell {{explains}} that the gun parts were the only artifacts from the Lasley Vore site that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> positively identified as coming from a specific country at a specific time. He said that these parts <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> there by la Harpe in 1719.|$|R
50|$|Due to his {{prominent}} judicial {{position on}} the state's supreme court, any judicial challenges to the 1890 constitution that <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> forth to the court would have been rejected by him. Calhoon died in November 1908.|$|R
5|$|The Court of King's Bench did {{act as an}} appellate body, hearing appeals {{from the}} Court of Common Pleas, eyre circuits, assize courts and local courts, but was not a court of last resort; its own records were sent to Parliament to be signed off on. The {{creation}} of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in 1585 created a court from which King's Bench decisions could be appealed to, and with {{the expansion of the}} Exchequer Chamber's jurisdiction in 1830 the King's Bench ceased to be an appellate court. Thanks to the Bill of Westminster and other legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Germans placed {{candles on}} their {{trenches}} and on Christmas trees, then continued the celebration by singing Christmas carols. The British responded by singing carols of their own. The two sides continued by shouting Christmas greetings to each other. Soon thereafter, there were excursions across No Man's Land, where small gifts were exchanged, such as food, tobacco and alcohol, and souvenirs such as buttons and hats. The artillery {{in the region}} fell silent. The truce also allowed a breathing spell where recently killed soldiers <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> back behind their lines by burial parties. Joint services were held. In many sectors, the truce lasted through Christmas night, continuing until New Year's Day in others.|$|E
5|$|The {{best known}} Welsh cheese is Caerphilly, named in 1831 but made long before that. Originally {{a method for}} storing excess milk until it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> to market, it was a moist cheese that would not last very long. Production of the cheese was halted due to milk {{rationing}} after World War II, although it was still made in England. There, the cheese was produced very quickly and sold early in its maturation process, creating a dryer cheese. In the 1970s, production of Caerphilly returned to Wales and over the following few decades {{a variety of new}} cheeses have also been produced in Wales.|$|E
50|$|The King's Bench {{held the}} action <b>could</b> rightly <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> in tort. The claim {{was against the}} killing of the horse, and not merely the failure to {{transport}} it. Accordingly no documentary proof of a covenant was needed.|$|R
50|$|While many {{additional}} charges <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>brought,</b> authorities {{concluded that a}} fair hearing would be impossible {{in view of the}} enormous publicity surrounding the original trial. Furthermore, the 15 life sentences already handed down rendered further litigation unnecessary.|$|R
