25|$|There are {{thousands}} of species whose stems have economic uses. Stems provide a few major staple crops such as potato and taro. Sugarcane stems are {{a major source of}} sugar. Maple sugar is obtained from trunks of maple trees. Vegetables from stems are asparagus, bamboo shoots, cactus pads or nopalitos, kohlrabi, and water chestnut. The spice, cinnamon is bark from a tree trunk. Gum arabic is an important food additive obtained from the trunks of Acacia senegal trees. <b>Chicle,</b> the main ingredient in chewing gum, is obtained from trunks of the <b>chicle</b> tree.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{chewing gum}} was first {{developed}} in the 1860s when <b>chicle</b> was brought from Mexico by the former President, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, to New York, where {{he gave it to}} Thomas Adams for use as a rubber substitute. <b>Chicle</b> did not succeed as a replacement for rubber, but as a gum, which was cut into strips and marketed as Adams New York Chewing Gum in 1871. Black Jack (1884), which is flavored with licorice, Chiclets (1899), and Wrigley's Spearmint Gum were early popular gums that quickly dominated the market and are all still around today. Chewing gum gained worldwide popularity through American GIs in WWII, who were supplied chewing gum as a ration and traded it with locals. Synthetic gums were first introduced to the U.S. after <b>chicle</b> no longer satisfied the needs of making good chewing gum. By the 1960s, US manufacturers had switched to butadiene-based synthetic rubber, as it was cheaper to manufacture.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} {{historic}} and early modern eras, the Yucatán Peninsula {{was largely a}} cattle ranching, logging, <b>chicle</b> and henequen production area. Since the 1970s (and {{the fall of the}} world henequen and <b>chicle</b> markets due to the advent of synthetic substitutes), the Yucatán Peninsula has reoriented its economy towards tourism, especially in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. Once a small fishing village, Cancún in the northeast of the peninsula has grown into a thriving city. The Riviera Maya, which stretches along the east coast of the peninsula between Cancún and Tulum, houses over 50,000 beds. The best-known locations are the former fishing town of Playa del Carmen, the ecological parks Xcaret and Xel-Há and the Maya ruins of Tulum and Coba.|$|E
25|$|Chewing gum in {{many forms}} has existed since the Neolithic period. 6,000-year-old chewing gum made from birch bark tar, with tooth imprints, {{has been found in}} Kierikki in Finland. The tar from which the gums were made is {{believed}} to have antiseptic properties and other medicinal benefits. It is chemically similar to petroleum tar and is in this way different from most other early gum. The Aztec, as well as the ancient Maya before them, used <b>chicle,</b> a natural tree gum, as a base for making a gum-like substance and to stick objects together in everyday use. Forms of chewing gums were also chewed in Ancient Greece. The Ancient Greeks chewed mastic gum, made from the resin of the mastic tree. Mastic gum, like birch bark tar, has antiseptic properties and {{is believed to have been}} used to maintain oral health. Both <b>chicle</b> and mastic are tree resins. Many other cultures have chewed gum-like substances made from plants, grasses, and resins.|$|E

50|$|Gumballs and <b>chicles,</b> {{a classic}} seller that {{can last for}} two years or more. Bubble gum sells well to children, while chewing gum sells better to adults. Dubble Bubble is {{reported}} to be a lower quality gum than Ford Gum and other brands. Gumballs sell best in machines by themselves, as opposed to being an option in a triple-selection machine. Gum is likely to become more popular among adults as more workplaces become smoke-free.|$|R
25|$|Inspired by the {{persistent}} Talking Cross sect, the Maya of Chan Santa Cruz remained actively {{hostile to the}} Mexican government well into the twentieth century. For many years, any non-Maya who entered the jungles {{of what is now}} the Mexican state of Quintana Roo was at risk of being killed outright. The combination of new economic factors, such as the entry of the Wrigley Company's <b>chicle</b> hunters into the region, and the political and social changes resulting from the Mexican Revolution, eventually reduced the hatred and hostility. In one form or another, war and armed struggle had continued for more than 50 years, and an estimated 40,000–50,000 people died in the hostilities.|$|E
25|$|Many {{other plants}} produce forms of latex rich in {{isoprene}} polymers, {{though not all}} produce usable forms of polymer as easily as the Pará. Some of them require more elaborate processing to produce anything like usable rubber, and most {{are more difficult to}} tap. Some produce other desirable materials, for example gutta-percha (Palaquium gutta) and <b>chicle</b> from Manilkara species. Others that have been commercially exploited, or at least showed promise as rubber sources, include the rubber fig (Ficus elastica), Panama rubber tree (Castilla elastica), various spurges (Euphorbia spp.), lettuce (Lactuca species), the related Scorzonera tau-saghyz, various Taraxacum species, including common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and Russian dandelion (Taraxacum kok-saghyz), and perhaps most importantly for its hypoallergenic properties, guayule (Parthenium argentatum). The term gum rubber is sometimes applied to the tree-obtained version of natural rubber in order to distinguish it from the synthetic version.|$|E
25|$|Marion M. Ganey, S.J., {{was largely}} {{responsible}} for introducing cooperatives and credit unions to Belize beginning in 1943, in response to Pius XI’s social encyclical Quadragesimo anno. Within 10 years of the first credit union, the colony had 22 credit unions and the “various cooperatives embraced consumer, marketing, housing, hog, <b>chicle,</b> and farmers co-operatives.” The religious sisters did their part, the Pallottines in Punta Gorda in the 1940s teaching girls the canning of produce. In 1951 Jesuit Fr. William Ulrich gave the Maya of San Antonio village a scale for weighing their hogs, protecting them from sharkers who grossly underestimated the weight. From increased revenue the villagers bought a truck to carry their hogs and other produce to market, and a hog cooperative was formed. Ulrich’s action also impacted village politics. By encouraging “the election of younger and more progressive men to the Alcalde’s Council which {{had been set up}} by Fr. Knopp” this “irretrievably altered the traditional relationship between the old and the young.” The credit union movement included Jesuit Henry Sutti, the first priest to come out of Boys Town, Nebraska, and in 1943 founder of the Holy Redeemer Credit Union, which in 2009 was capitalized at Bz$322.7 million with 42,262 members. Since 1956, the Director of the Credit union has been Jane Ellen Usher.|$|E
500|$|Likewise {{a number}} of English words have been {{borrowed}} from Nahuatl through Spanish. Two {{of the most prominent}} are undoubtedly chocolate and tomato (from Nahuatl tomatl). Other common words such as coyote (from Nahuatl coyotl), avocado (from Nahuatl ahuacatl) and chile or chili (from Nahuatl chilli). The word <b>chicle</b> is also derived from Nahuatl tzictli [...] "sticky stuff, chicle". Some other English words from Nahuatl are: Aztec (from aztecatl); cacao (from Nahuatl cacahuatl 'shell, rind'); ocelot (from ocelotl). In Mexico many words for common everyday concepts attest to the close contact between Spanish and Nahuatl, so many in fact that entire dictionaries of [...] "mexicanismos" [...] (words particular to Mexican Spanish) have been published tracing Nahuatl etymologies, as well as Spanish words with origins in other indigenous languages. Many well known [...] also come from Nahuatl, including Mexico (from the Nahuatl word for the Aztec capital mexihco) and Guatemala (from the word cuauhtēmallan).|$|E
500|$|Although the storm's {{intensity}} was {{equivalent to}} a Category2 hurricane, sustained winds in Belize reached only [...] Damage from the hurricane was mainly limited to an area along the coast about [...] north to south and [...] east to west. In San Pedro Town, about 90% of structures were destroyed. Newtown was completely demolished, causing its resident to establish the city of Hopkins further south. At Ambergris Caye, many houses and coconut plantations were damaged or destroyed. This forced many laborers and coconut plantation owners to seek new professions; most of them entered the fishing industry. Nine deaths were reported, though the toll may have been higher, as numerous small fishing boats were beached or swept out to sea. Widespread damage to vegetation and trees occurred. An assessment of damage after the storm indicated that more than 75% of the canopy species had been destroyed. Although the low bush was not badly damaged, about 25% to 50% of the pine trees were toppled. Damage on deep soils was largely from breakage while on shallow soils mostly from wind throw. Tides along the coast split Caye Caulker into three separate islands and swept away [...] "everything in its path". Overall, damage totaled approximately $4million, with $1million to private and public property, including buildings and dwellings. The remaining $3million in damage was incurred to coconuts and other crops; this total possibly includes damage to the mahogany and <b>chicle</b> industries.|$|E
2500|$|Barbour's {{brother had}} been {{involved}} in founding American <b>Chicle</b> Company, the originator of Chiclets. [...] In 1910, Barbour went into business with his brother-in-law, Bartlett Arkell, who had founded the Beech-Nut Packing Company. [...] Until that time, Beech-Nut had been a producer of high-grade foodstuffs. [...] On Barbour's recommendation, Beech-Nut entered the chewing gum business. [...] Barbour traveled extensively in Guatemala, Honduras, British Honduras (now known as Belize) and the Yucatán to procure the company's supply of <b>chicle,</b> the rubbery sap of the sapota tree that was the key ingredient in chewing gum. [...] Barbour served as a director of Beech-Nut from 1910 to 1948 and became vice president in 1921. [...] Chewing gum eventually became Beech-Nut's most successful product, providing $11 million of the company's $18 million in sales in 1935. [...] As of 1925, Barbour and Arkell were the vice president and president, respectively, of Beech-Nut. [...] In 1946, following Arkell's death, Barbour was elected as {{the chairman of the board}} of Beech-Nut.|$|E
2500|$|The first flavored {{chewing gum}} {{was created in}} the 1860s by John Colgan, a Louisville, Kentucky pharmacist. Colgan mixed with {{powdered}} sugar the aromatic flavoring tolu, a powder obtained from an extract of the balsam tree (Myroxylon), creating small sticks of flavored chewing gum he named [...] "Taffy Tolu". Colgan also lead the way in the manufacturing and packaging of chicle-based chewing gum, derived from Manilkara <b>chicle,</b> a tropical evergreen tree. He licensed a patent for automatically cutting chips of chewing gum from larger sticks: US 966,160 [...] "Chewing Gum Chip Forming Machine" [...] August 2, 1910 and a patent for automatically cutting wrappers for sticks of chewing gum: US 913,352 [...] "Web-cutting attachment for wrapping-machines" [...] February 23, 1909 from Louisville, Kentucky inventor James Henry Brady, an employee of the Colgan Gum Company.|$|E
2500|$|The Porfirio Díaz era {{at the end}} of the 19th {{century and}} {{beginning}} of the 20th was initially thwarted by regional bosses called caciques, bolstered by a wave of Spanish and mestizo farmers who migrated to the state and added to the elite group of wealthy landowning families. There was some technological progress such as a highway from San Cristóbal to the Oaxaca border and the first telephone line in the 1880s, but Porfirian era economic reforms would not begin until 1891 with Governor Emilio Rabasa. This governor took on the local and regional caciques and centralized power into the state capital, which he moved from San Cristóbal de las Casas to Tuxtla in 1892. [...] He modernized public administration, transportation and promoted education. Rabasa also introduced telegraph, limited public schooling, sanitation and road construction, including a route from San Cristóbal to Tuxtla then Oaxaca, which signaled the beginning of favoritism of development in the central valley over the highlands. He also changed state policies to favor foreign investment, favored large land mass consolidation for the production of cash crops such as henequen, rubber, guayule, cochineal and coffee. Agricultural production boomed, especially coffee, which induced the construction of port facilities in Tonalá. The economic expansion and investment in roads also increased access to tropical commodities such as hardwoods, rubber and <b>chicle.</b>|$|E
