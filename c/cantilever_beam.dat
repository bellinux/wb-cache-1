25|$|The {{restoration}} {{was carried}} out by Mr and Mrs H Fisk, Marcus Cook and Chris Hullcoop. The mill was repainted, with paint donated by ICI. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings entered into talks with East Suffolk County Council and a small grant was given to the volunteers. In 1964, Stanley Freese joined the team. The fantail was repaired and the Spring sails were dismantled as they were unsafe. Neville Martin, the Beccles millwright, inspected the mill for the Ministry of Works. As the mill was not structurally sound enough to be a working mill, it was decided to restore it as a landmark. Four Common sails were fitted; these are lighter than Spring sails. The body of the mill was reinforced by a <b>cantilever</b> <b>beam</b> to support the prick post added when the head of the mill was extended.|$|E

Regarding these features, an interesting question, still pending, is {{which one is}} most sensitive for use in damage identification. The present study addresses the key sensitivity of these features for damage identification in <b>cantilever</b> <b>beams,</b> wherein these features are extremely similar in configurations. The intrinsic relation between the fundamental mode shape and static deflection is discussed, and in particular, an explicit generic sensitivity rule describing the sensitivity of these features to damage in <b>cantilever</b> <b>beams</b> is proposed. The efficiency of this rule in identifying damage is investigated using EulerBernoulli <b>cantilever</b> <b>beams</b> with a crack. The validity of the approach is supported by three-dimensional elastic finite element simulation, incorporating the potential scatter in actual measurements.
