40|$|Abstract: Complicated {{mathematical}} {{models are}} usually used for processing measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth magnetic field carried out onboard an Earth artificial satellite. It is desirable {{to verify the}} measurement data by humble tools before such processing. If a few onboard magnetometers made their measurements at the same instants, then one ought to check a simple geometrical <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measurement data. One can estimate constant shifts in the data and transition matrices between proper coordinate systems for each pair of magnetometers in case the check proved to be successful. Bellow, we described the method for checking <b>the</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measurement data produced by two magnetometers. We illustrate the method by checking <b>the</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetic measurements produced by the equipment Mirage onboard Foton M- 2.
