5000|$|The Aero Car is {{suspended}} on six interlocking steel cables, {{each of which}} is 25 mm in diameter. The car is powered by an electric [...] motor and travels at approximately 7 km/h. In the event of a power failure, a diesel engine drives a hydraulic pump to pull the carrier back to the loading/unloading terminal. It also has a <b>rescue</b> <b>car</b> which holds four passengers and one operator. The <b>rescue</b> <b>car</b> has so far only been used for training purposes.|$|R
50|$|The <b>rescue</b> <b>cars</b> were {{eventually}} replaced mostly by modified Škoda Octavia models. Nevertheless, the T-623 {{went on to}} {{form the basis of}} the Czech first super-sports car, the MTX Tatra V8.|$|R
50|$|The car was {{originally}} open, but a roof {{has been added}} to all later designs. A four-person <b>rescue</b> <b>car</b> is available (a smaller white car stored at the opposite end in an indoor area), but not used in regular service.|$|R
50|$|The Westpac Rescue Helicopter is a BK117 {{emergency}} {{air rescue}} service which operates out of Wellington Hospital. It is used primarily for {{search and rescue}} but may {{also be used for}} police and bomb squad operations, or in firefighting. The helicopter often <b>rescues</b> <b>car</b> accident victims, injured trampers stranded in the bush, or performs rescues in other areas which are a considerable distance from any nearby hospital.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1984, during routine maintenance, an {{auxiliary}} cable snapped and {{wrapped around the}} main cable tracks. The Desert Sun newspaper reported that if the broken cable hadn't wedged itself under the main track cables, a <b>rescue</b> <b>car</b> with the tram's workmen in it could have plummeted down the mountain into the lower tramway station. [...] "Without the snag," [...] a state investigator said, [...] "those two men wouldn't be with us today." ...|$|R
5000|$|The crash {{also showed}} that the track's {{distances}} were too long for regular fire engines and ambulances, even though the [...] "ONS-Staffel" [...] was equipped with a Porsche 911 <b>rescue</b> <b>car,</b> marked (R). The old Nürburgring never hosted another F1 race again, as the German Grand Prix {{was moved to the}} Hockenheimring for 1977. The German motorcycle Grand Prix was held for the last time on the old Nürburgring in 1980, also permanently moving to Hockenheim.|$|R
50|$|Late in {{the program}} a number of safety studies were carried out. Fire was a major concern of safety officials, but due to the {{simplicity}} of the vehicles, and a fire safety risk-reduction program it was demonstrated the possibility of fire was reduced to a non-issue. Other problems, like broken motors or a widespread power failure that demanded evacuation, were the primary areas of concern, but the solutions were found to lay in ground based equipment and in specially equipped <b>rescue</b> <b>cars</b> that could operate on the guideway and access both levels. The final system plans required no external walkways.|$|R
5000|$|Lauda's {{accident}} proved why the old Nürburgring {{had become}} too dangerous and too difficult to manage satisfactorily for Formula One. The Nordschleife was far too long for regular fire engines and ambulances, even though the [...] "ONS-Staffel" [...] was equipped with a Porsche 911 <b>rescue</b> <b>car.</b> Had {{it not been for}} the efforts of his fellow drivers, Lauda would have likely died before rescue crews arrived. After the Nürburgring was rebuilt and shortened, Formula One would return to the new 2.8-mile Nürburgring for the European Grand Prix in 1984, and the German Grand Prix in 1985.|$|R
5000|$|On March 9, 1901, the Olds Motor Works factory {{burned to}} the ground. Only one model, the little Curved Dash runabout, was saved from the flames. Ransom Olds claimed it was the fire that made him select the runabout, from among his many other models, to put into production. His biographer {{questions}} the veracity of this story. He points to an Olds advertising blitz that had already led to more than 300 Curved Dash orders even before the fire took place. [...] "Olds did not need the one <b>rescued</b> <b>car</b> from which to reconstruct the plans and patterns for the runabout." ...|$|R

50|$|A police {{aircraft}} is an rotary-wing aircraft, fixed-wing aircraft, nonrigid-wing aircraft or {{lighter-than-air aircraft}} used in police operations.

In major cities in the United States, police helicopters are also used as air transportation for SWAT personnel.|$|R
40|$|Lineage-specific {{transcription}} {{factors are}} critical for long-range enhancer interactions, but {{direct or indirect}} contributions of architectural proteins such as CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) to enhancer function remain less clear. The LDB 1 complex mediates enhancer-gene interactions at the β-globin locus through LDB 1 self-interaction. We find that an LDB 1 -bound enhancer upstream of carbonic anhydrase 2 (Car 2) activates its expression by interacting directly with CTCF at the gene promoter. Both LDB 1 and CTCF are required for enhancer-Car 2 looping, and the domain of LDB 1 contacted by CTCF is necessary to <b>rescue</b> <b>Car</b> 2 transcription in LDB 1 -deficient cells. Genome-wide studies and CRISPR/Cas 9 genome editing indicate that LDB 1 -CTCF enhancer looping underlies activation of a substantial fraction of erythroid genes. Our results provide a mechanism by which long-range interactions of architectural protein CTCF can be tailored to achieve a tissue-restricted pattern of chromatin loops and gene expression...|$|R

50|$|Police {{aviation}} {{is the use}} of rotary-wing aircraft, fixed-wing aircraft, nonrigid-wing aircraft or {{lighter-than-air aircraft}} in police operations.

In some major cities, police rotary-wing aircraft are also used as air transportation for personnel belonging to SWAT-style units.

50|$|Flash floods {{occurred}} at the road's iconic junction with Scotts Road on 16 June 2010 after 100mm of rain fell from 8 am to 11 am, reportedly the worst flood at the junction since 1984. Shopping malls along Orchard Road such as Lucky Plaza and Liat Towers were affected. The flood had caused some shopping mall and car park basements to be submerged. Around 70 people had to be <b>rescued</b> from <b>cars</b> and buses, as flooding shut down Orchard Road. Some people sustained injuries.|$|R

High floodwaters damaged 22 bridges and closed 2 indefinitely, while the flooding closed several roads, including a portion of U.S. Highway 1 in Chadds Ford. Damage in Pennsylvania totaled to $3.5 million (2003 USD, $3.8 million 2006 USD). The impacts were severely compounded the following week by Hurricane Isabel across the region.|$|R
