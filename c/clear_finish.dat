500|$|In {{the lumber}} {{industry}} Acer rubrum {{is considered a}} [...] "soft maple", a designation it shares, commercially, with silver maple (A. saccharinum). In this context, the term [...] "soft" [...] is more comparative, than descriptive; i.e., [...] "soft maple", while softer than it's harder cousin, sugar maple (A. saccharum), is still a fairly hard wood, being comparable to Black Cherry (Prunus serotina) in this regard. [...] Like A. saccharum, the wood of red maple is close-grained, but its texture is softer, less dense, and has not as desirable an appearance, particularly under a <b>clear</b> <b>finish.</b> [...] However, the wood from Acer rubrum while being typically less expensive than hard maple, also has greater dimensional stability than that of A. saccharum, and also machines and stains easier. Thus, high grades of wood from the red maple can be substituted for hard maple, {{particularly when it comes}} to making stain/paint-grade furniture. Red maple lumber also contains a greater percentage of [...] "curly" [...] (aka [...] "flame"/"fiddleback") figure, which is prized by musical instrument/custom furniture makers, as well as the veneer industry. [...] As a soft maple, the wood tends to shrink more during the drying process than with the hard maples.|$|E

50|$|Thin CA glue has {{application}} in woodworking. It {{can be used}} as a fast-drying, glossy finish. The use of oil (such as boiled linseed oil) may be used to control the rate at which the CA cures. CA glue is also used in combination with sawdust (from a saw or sanding) to fill voids and cracks. These repair methods are used on piano soundboards, wood instruments, and wood furniture. CA glue is also used in the finishing of pen blanks that have been turned on a lathe by applying multiple thin layers to build up a hard, <b>clear</b> <b>finish</b> that can then be sanded and polished to a glossy finish.|$|E
50|$|Clear {{finishes}} {{are intended}} to make wood look good and meet the demands {{to be placed on}} the finish. Choosing a <b>clear</b> <b>finish</b> for wood involves trade-offs between appearance, protection, durability, safety, requirements for cleaning, and ease of application. The following table compares the characteristics of different clear finishes. 'Rubbing qualities' indicates the ease with which a finish can be manipulated to deliver the finish desired.Shellac should be considered in two different ways. It is used thinned with denatured alcohol as a finish and as a way to manipulate the wood's ability to absorb other finishes. The alcohol evaporates almost immediately to yield a finish that will attach to virtually any surface, even glass, and virtually any other finish can be used over it.|$|E

50|$|Moulthrop's {{vessels are}} admired {{for a number}} of reasons. Their scale is larger than most other pieces. It was not {{uncommon}} to see him turning a large, 5 ft piece on the lathe in his home workshop. Because of these large-scale projects, Moulthrop had to invent a lot of his own tools, the same tools that would later be featured in several wood arts magazines. Another innovation of his was his use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to help prevent cracking in his more advanced pieces. His turned wood pieces would be coated with a <b>clear</b> <b>finish</b> that would be as smooth as glass. This later characteristic helped some of his vessels find their way into collections of well-known glass collectors.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979, a {{low-cost}} SG made of walnut wood was introduced called [...] "The SG." [...] It had a <b>clear</b> <b>finish</b> and an ebony fingerboard and {{was accompanied by}} low-cost [...] "Les Paul" [...] and [...] "ES 335" [...] type guitars. [...] "The Paul" [...] was also made from walnut, but [...] "The ES" [...] was made out of solid mahogany (rather than the semi-solid body they usually produced). All three guitars were discontinued after about a year, replaced by the [...] "firebrand" [...] series, again made of mahogany. Also in 1979 a limited edition model, the SG Exclusive was produced. Visually similar to the SG Standard of the time, the special features included an ebony fretboard, two Dirty Fingers humbucker pickups, and a master volume, two tone controls, and rotary coil tap that gradually eliminated one coil from each humbucker. The finish was black with cream color plastics and the truss rod cover read [...] "Exclusive".|$|E
50|$|In a match {{where the}} lead swung {{back and forth}} several times, the two titans tested {{each other in a}} wide variety of opening formations, and every game (except the 24th) was full-blooded and played hard to a <b>clear</b> <b>finish.</b> Bronstein often avoided lines he had favored in earlier events, and {{frequently}} adopted Botvinnik's own preferred variations. This strategy seemed to catch Botvinnik by surprise; the champion had not played competitively for three years since winning the title in 1948. The quality of play was very high by both players, although Botvinnik would later complain of his own weak play. He only grudgingly acknowledged Bronstein's huge talent. Bronstein claimed four of his five match wins by deep combinational play, winning before adjournment in highly complex fashion. He led by one point with two games to go, but lost the 23rd game and drew the final (24th) game. Under FIDE rules, the title remained with the holder, and Bronstein was never to come so close again. He later wrote that it was likely better that he didn't win the world title, since his free-spirited, artistic personality would have been at odds with Soviet bureaucracy.|$|E
