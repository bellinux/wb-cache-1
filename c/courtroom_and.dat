5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive. Goldhill writes that the theatre {{can be seen as}} a social and political event analogous with the Assembly and the <b>courtroom,</b> <b>and</b> women may have been excluded. David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If women did attend the theatre, they may have sat separately from the men.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the town}} was {{destroyed}} by fire in 1577. After this time the town was largely rebuilt including Waterloo House and Manor Court House in Fore Street which were built as a house and <b>courtroom,</b> <b>and</b> have now been converted into shops and offices. Further damage to the town {{took place during the}} English Civil War with both sides plundering its resources, particularly in 1644 when Charles I spent a week in the town.|$|E
50|$|During the 20th century, the {{building}} underwent several significant interior alterations, {{which included the}} addition of new <b>courtrooms</b> <b>and</b> {{the removal of the}} train tracks. Renovations that began in 2002 involved the modernization of existing <b>courtrooms</b> <b>and</b> the installation of six new <b>courtrooms</b> <b>and</b> judge's chambers to accommodate the growing needs of the courts.

5|$|The {{condition}} of the building continued to deteriorate although the gatehouse remained in use as a court. In 1728 George Cholmondeley, 2nd Earl of Cholmondeley leased the site from the Crown. In 1737 a courthouse {{was built on the}} site of the medieval gatehouse. Henry Sephton, a Liverpool architect and builder and John Orme, a joiner from Prescot, were appointed to carry out the work. The first floor was the <b>courtroom</b> <b>and</b> prisoners were held in the basement. By 1792 the courthouse had fallen into disrepair and money was found to repair it, although the source of that money is unclear. The court continued to function there until 1908.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of the Creek Turnpike, from US-75 in Jenks to US-64/US-169 in Tulsa, was first {{authorized}} in 1987, with construction beginning in 1989. The turnpike's construction was controversial; homeowners along {{the route of the}} highway formed a group called Tulsans Against Turnpikes to fight the highway in both the <b>courtroom</b> <b>and</b> the media. The highway was also challenged on environmental grounds, with impacts upon wetlands and endangered species being the chief concerns. Nevertheless, the highway opened to traffic in three sections, starting from the easternmost, {{over the course of the}} first half of 1992.|$|E
5|$|Poole's Guildhall {{has played}} a varied part {{in the history of}} the town. A Grade II* listed {{building}}, the Guildhall was built in 1761 at a cost of £2,250. The new building included an open market house on the ground floor and a <b>courtroom</b> <b>and</b> offices for the town council on the first floor and has also been used as a Court of Record, Magistrates' Court, Court of Admiralty and a venue for Quarter Sessions. Between 1819 and 1821 the building was consecrated as a Parish Church while the old St. James Church was pulled down and replaced with the present church. During the Second World War the building was used as a canteen and meeting room for American soldiers prior to the invasion of France. The showers and washing facilities installed at this time were later converted into public baths which were used until the 1960s. The building was converted for use as the town museum between 1971 and 1991 but stood empty for the next 16 years. After a renovation project funded by Poole Borough Council, the restored Guildhall opened in June 2007 as a Register Office for weddings, civil partnerships and other civic ceremonies.|$|E
50|$|Edward Allan Farnsworth (June 30, 1928 - January 31, 2005) {{was one of}} America's most renowned legal {{scholars}} on contracts. His writings were standard reference in <b>courtrooms</b> <b>and</b> law schools.|$|R

25|$|During Spilsbury's lifetime, and {{as early}} as 1925 after the murder {{conviction}} of Norman Thorne, concern began to be expressed by informed opinion about his domination of the <b>courtroom</b> <b>and</b> {{about the quality of}} his methodology. The influential Law Journal expressed 'profound disquiet' at the verdict, noting 'the more than Papal infallibility with which Sir Bernard Spilsbury is rapidly being invested by juries.'.|$|E

25|$|The Oregon Supreme Court Building {{currently}} {{houses the}} courtroom for the Supreme Court and the state’s law library. This single courtroom {{is also home}} to where oral arguments are heard for the Oregon Court of Appeals, while the building is home to Oregon Judicial Department. The Supreme Court’s <b>courtroom</b> <b>and</b> offices for the justices are located on the third floor. This building is the oldest state government building in Oregon. In 2006, new security measures were implemented at the building that require visitors to sign in with an Oregon State Police officer who is posted at a security desk near the main entrance to the building on the first floor.|$|E
25|$|A {{room on the}} {{northeast}} corner of {{the third floor of the}} Arsenal was made into a <b>courtroom,</b> <b>and</b> the prisoners were brought into the room through a side door, which prevented them from passing by or being harassed by spectators. Surratt was given special considerations during the trial because of her illness and gender. In the courtroom, she sat apart from the other prisoners. Sources differ as to whether an armed guard sat on either side of her, like for other prisoners during the trial. While the others wore wrist and ankle manacles in the courtroom, she did not. She was also permitted a bonnet, fan, and veil to hide her face from spectators. As her illness worsened during the trial, she was moved to a larger and more comfortable prison cell.|$|E
25|$|The title, without {{needing to}} {{actually}} include Charteris, {{allows for the}} play {{to serve as a}} critique of abuses of power and immorality. Justice Squeezum represents the flaws of society, while Justice Worthy represents England as it tries to deal with the various problems. The play serves as a way for Fielding to express his own views about society in his comedy. Fielding furthered this end by using Aristophanes as a model, and the theatre became his means to encouraging social change. However, the play is still a comedy, and the social agenda stands besides romantic intrigue and traditional comedic situations. There is an emphasis on legal matters, and the final words deal with crime. As such, the theatre serves as a kind of <b>courtroom,</b> <b>and</b> the characters are judged throughout the play with Fielding serving as a sort of prosecutor.|$|E

25|$|Between 2002 and 2003, the {{courthouse}} underwent a major restoration that involved, not only electrical, mechanical and plumbing improvements {{as well as}} necessary accessibility enhancements such as the installation of an elevator, but also the correction of many architecturally insensitive modifications undergone previously. These included restoring the balcony and original furnishings in the <b>courtroom</b> <b>and</b> faux wood and metal ceiling finishes throughout the building. Exterior improvements included repairs to doors, windows and masonry, a new metal shingle roof, sheet metal repairs to cornices, and renovation of the clock tower. These renovations were performed {{at a cost of}} $2.8 million supported by a THC grant of $2.3 million with the remainder supported by local funding. The grant was administered as part of the THC's Texas Historic Courthouse Preservation Program, created to support counties preserve their current and former historic courthouses after the state's historic courthouses were included in the 1998 listing of most endangered historic places by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.|$|E
25|$|The courthouse's base floor, {{elevated}} {{above the}} ground of the surrounding square and accessible from steps {{on each side of}} the building except the wheelchair-accessible west side, holds space for several county offices arranged around central crossing corridors connecting the entrances in the middle of each side of the building in each cardinal direction. The base floor also includes the county judge's courtroom, a vault for storage of county records, restrooms, and storage space. On the east side of the building, two flights of stairs lead to the second floor. The first flight consists of two separate stairways that combine around the base of a wider central flight ending at the second floor facing the entrance to the main courtroom. A second stairway is located south of the west end of the building's main central corridor and is used to provide access to offices and other facilities behind the upper <b>courtroom</b> <b>and</b> as use as a secondary fire escape. An elevator on the southeast side of the building also adjoins the two main floors.|$|E
25|$|The retry of Deck’s penalty phase {{began on}} April 29, 2003, {{where he was}} brought into court wearing shackles. The defense objected to Deck being visibly restrained, stating that Deck’s {{behavior}} did not justify shackles. The defense stated the only justification for shackling Deck {{would have been if}} he caused a disturbance in the courtroom. However, he did not. The defense also suggested other measures that the court could have taken to ensure safety instead of shackling Deck. These measures included adding extra security guards to the <b>courtroom,</b> <b>and</b> having the people who wanted to sit in the gallery walk through metal detectors. However, the defense’s objections were overruled. Deck’s attorneys once again objected during voir dire. Deck’s defense thought that asking jurors if the shackles biased them was not enough to ensure that Deck would receive reliable sentencing. The court overruled the objection again, stating “The objection that you’re making will be overruled. He has been convicted and will remain in legirons and belly chain.” The jury once again sentenced Deck to death.|$|E

50|$|The {{structure}} {{is a classic}} example of Brutalist architecture; its façade is dominated by large Precast concrete panels with narrow windows. The design was conceived with limited windows to keep the <b>courtrooms</b> <b>and</b> judges' chambers free from outside distraction.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} contains 54 <b>courtrooms</b> <b>and</b> 11 adjudication rooms. The {{inside of}} the court building's walls are covered with script of the Laws of the Norwegian people (Norske Lov), transposed to demonstrate the difficulty that people have in understanding them.|$|R
25|$|It was {{not until}} the 1950s that the {{courthouse}} undertook major renovations. In 1955, the distillate stoves were replaced with butane heaters allowing the chimneys to be reduced to roof level while the roof was also replaced. In 1956, the roof would be replaced again for the fifth or sixth time since the building's completion in 1911. New flooring was installed in the <b>courtroom</b> <b>and</b> some offices, and the courtroom ceiling was lowered for acoustics and heating. In the courtroom, theater-style seating was installed while the upper gallery was removed. A new plywood bench for the judge and a jury box with matching railing were built. The stained glass window behind the judge's bench was boarded and plastered. Downstairs, exterior steel doors were installed, and a counter shelf was built for the office of the sheriff and tax-assessor collector along with five fire extinguishers provided for the premises. In 1957, two gas heaters with electric blowers were installed in the space formerly occupied by the courtroom's upper gallery to heat the courtroom. The building's roof would require replacement in 1974 and again 1975.|$|E

25|$|Sydney Lewis Hall is {{the home}} of the school of law on the {{historic}} campus of Washington and Lee in Lexington, Virginia. Lewis Hall was built in 1977 with a $9 million gift from Best Products founder Sydney Lewis and his wife Frances of Virginia. Lewis Hall was designed by Marcellus Wright Cox & Smith Architects in the Mid-century modern style. In addition to lecture halls, classrooms, and offices for faculty and staff, Lewis Hall houses the 150-seat Millhiser Moot Courtroom with the accompanying Robert E.
