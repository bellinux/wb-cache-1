40|$|When {{a person}} dies without a will, the State {{effectively}} supplies a will by default via {{the laws of}} intestate succession. The laws of intestate succession may trigger a transfer of real property – “Land, and generally whatever is erected or growing upon or affixed to land ” (Black 1983, 636) – {{in the form of}} tenancy in common. Tenancy in common is a form of joint ownership in which cotenants have an undivided partial interest in property. If a <b>cotenant</b> dies intestate, any interest in property passes to his heirs (Black). An undivided partial interest allows a <b>cotenant</b> (subject to the rights of other cotenants) to use the entire property as if it were his own regardless of the size of his partial interest in the property. Tenancy in common that is the result of an inter-generational transfer of property through intestate succession {{is often referred to as}} heir property (Mitchell 2001). Tenancy in common is a legal form of real property and is not necessarily the result of the laws of intestate succession. Some people choose to hold property as tenants in common. Some purposefully will their property to their heirs as tenants in common. In this paper, I use the term heir property to refer to property that is held in tenancy in common as a result of the laws of intestate succession. My focus on intestate succession results in part from the fact that poor people are more likely than others to die without a valid will (AARP 2000). Hence, any economic consequences associated with the laws of intestate succession will be of greater significance to low income people and the regions where they live. The prevalence of poverty is not evenly distributed across rural America. Pockets of poverty persist. The Appalachian Region, Indian Reservations and the Ozarks are notable rural examples. Since intestate succession may be endemic to these areas, it is important to further examine its influence on property ownership and any subsequent economic consequences...|$|E

40|$|In the United States {{the laws}} of {{intestate}} succession can lead to real property being owned as tenancy in common. As a result, over time, large numbers of cotenants may own the same property; each <b>cotenant</b> possessing a fractional undivided interest to the jointly owned property. Property characterized by this form of joint ownership {{is often referred to}} as heir property. Recent literature has identified two prominent concerns regarding heir property: (1) efficiency concerns and (2) displacement concerns. In this paper we examine these issues using case study evidence from three families in eastern Kentucky. Our case studies provide evidence of both the efficiency and displacement concerns. To further assess and better understand the character of heir property we empirically examine affidavits of descent in Letcher County, Kentucky filed in the year 2000. The empirical results illuminate the general character of the family that survives an intestate death further clarifying the effect of intestacy law on specific family members.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{partition}} of real and personal property in Florida in the 21 st century. It discusses questions and issues about partitioning real and personal property, so that private lawyers who practice {{in a variety of}} areas can familiarize themselves with how partition proceedings work. Partition of real and personal property is not restricted to one area of the law. Instead, it relates to and bleeds over into a multitude of areas of the law making it necessary for all practitioners to be familiar with the area of partition. Partition is now provided in all 50 states, and Florida’s partition law is regulated by Chapter 64, Florida Statutes. Partition may seem simple and straight forward for the purpose of dividing jointly owned real and personal property, nonetheless the partition process can be cumbersome, unpredictable, and confusing. When joint owners of real and personal property – whether they are married, unmarried live-in companions, cotenants as business partners and shareholders, or beneficiaries of real and personal property – come to a decision to part ways they often find that breaking up their undivided interests is hard to do. Today’s lawyers’ will come in contact with disputes regarding joint ownership of real and personal property especially on account of an improving economy. Cotenants are no longer reluctant to divide and sell their real property on account of the increased value of their jointly held real property in light of a growing and stronger economy. This article discusses issues pertaining to partition, including the following: stating a cause of action for partition and whether property is divisible or indivisible; exceptions to mandatory partition; what is property according to Chapter 64, Florida Statutes; treatment of a deposit and down payment when purchasing jointly titled real property; applicability of the statute of limitations to a partition actions; maximizing interests in real and personal property partition actions and the importance of a written agreement upon separation; contractual and statutory provisions for entitlement to attorney fees; other causes of actions that may be consolidated in a partition proceeding; personal and constructive service of process; when does jointly titled property vest in a <b>cotenant</b> upon death of an cotenant; setoffs and credits in jointly titled marital residence; the benefits and burdens of cotenants of jointly own real and personal property; homestead property and forced sale in partition; “ouster” of one <b>cotenant</b> and the effect of ouster on setoffs and credits; nonexistent and void ab initio marriage and its effect on joint ownership in partition; effect of Obergefell v. Hodges and same-sex marriage on partition...|$|E
