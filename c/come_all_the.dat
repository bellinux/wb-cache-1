5|$|Although {{details of}} the siege were not recorded, it {{appeared}} to be bloodless. The Byzantine garrison could not expect any help from the humbled regime of Heraclius. After a siege of four months, Sophronius offered to surrender the city and pay a jizya (tribute), on condition that the caliph came to Jerusalem to sign the pact and accept the surrender. It is said that when Sophronius's terms became known to the Muslims, Shurahbil ibn Hassana, one of the Muslim commanders, suggested that instead of waiting for the caliph to <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way from Madinah, Khalid ibn Walid should be sent forward as the caliph, as he was very similar in appearance to Umar. The subterfuge did not work. Possibly, Khalid was too famous in Syria, or there may have been Christian Arabs in the city who had visited Madinah and had seen both Umar and Khalid, remembering the differences. Consequently, the Patriarch of Jerusalem refused to negotiate. When Khalid reported the failure of this mission, Abu Ubaidah wrote to caliph Umar about the situation, and invited him to come to Jerusalem to accept the surrender of the city.|$|E

And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E

25|$|The raid was {{ultimately}} a failure as {{none of the}} objectives were achieved by the British. No casualties were inflicted upon the Germans, no prisoners were taken and the only damage inflicted was a cut telephone line. Additionally, {{the quality of the}} planning and conduct of the operation has been called into question. Much of the equipment used was either not servicable—faulty compasses, and motor launches that broke down—or inadequate for the job and launches that were unable to <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way into the beach due to their draught. Also some of the tasks that had been assigned were impractical or had not been rehearsed—the wire intended for use as a road block was too heavy to carry from the beach—and intelligence relating to German dispositions upon the island was at best outdated or completely wrong. The commandos also found they were burdened with equipment that was not of use, including steel helmets, gaiters and an excess of ammunition. Largely this {{was the result of the}} haste with which the operation had been conceived and then put together, but it was also indicative of the embryonic status of the raiding and commandos concept.|$|E

In 1625 [...] "arranged prayers" [...] at the Wall are mentioned for the first time by a scholar whose name has not been preserved.

500|$|As an educator, Boult {{influenced}} {{several generations}} of musicians, beginning with his conducting class at the Royal College of Music, London, which he ran from 1919 to 1930. As no such classes had been held before in Britain, Boult [...] "created its curriculum from {{out of his own}} experience.... From that first small class has <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> later formal training for conductors throughout Britain." [...] In the 1930s Boult ran a series of [...] "conferences for conductors" [...] at his country house near Guildford, sometimes helped by Vaughan Williams who lived a few miles away. From 1962 to 1966 he again taught at the Royal College of Music. In later life, he made time for young conductors who sought his counsel. [...] Among those who studied with or were influenced by Boult were Colin Davis, James Loughran, Richard Hickox and Vernon Handley. The last was not only a pupil of Boult, but acted as his musical assistant on many occasions.|$|E
500|$|Several Jewish {{authors of}} the 10th and 11th centuries write about the Jews resorting to the Western Wall for devotional purposes. Ahimaaz relates that Rabbi Samuel ben Paltiel (980-1010) gave money for oil at [...] "the {{sanctuary}} at the Western Wall." [...] Benjamin of Tudela (1170) wrote [...] "In front of this place is the Western Wall, {{which is one of}} the walls of the Holy of Holies. This is called the Gate of Mercy, and hither <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Jews to pray before the Wall in the open court." [...] The account gave rise to confusion about the actual location of Jewish worship and some suggest that Benjamin in fact referred to the Eastern Wall along with its Gate of Mercy. While Nahmanides (d. 1270) did not mention a synagogue near the Western Wall in his detailed account of the temple site, shortly before the Crusader period a synagogue existed at the site. Obadiah of Bertinoro (1488) states [...] "the Westen Wall, part of which is still standing, is made of great, thick stones, larger than any I have seen in buildings of antiquity in Rome or in other lands." ...|$|E

Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and the rest of the office convince Dwight to get revenge on the shop owner by making Dwight appear to be high-class, and then having him refuse to buy from the shop, a scheme the office references from the movie Pretty Woman. Using tips from the rest of the office to make himself appear more sophisticated, Dwight, with Jim and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), return to the shop. To their surprise, the shop owner immediately recognizes Dwight even in his new attire, and explains that they did not serve him before because they were intimidated by his blood-soaked hands (actually beet juice). Dwight, somewhat flustered from the truth of the situation being revealed to him, stumbles over his words before finally saying the line he had <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way there to say, [...] "You made a big mistake.

500|$|Given {{the task}} of {{overhauling}} the Cardinals by owner Gussie Busch (and specifically to unload Templeton), Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager Jack McKeon at the 1981 baseball winter meetings. While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal. [...] McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece. It was then that Padres manager Dick Williams informed Herzog that a no-trade clause had been included in Smith's 1981 contract. Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in San Diego, {{but he was still}} interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say. While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday. Smith later recalled that, [...] "Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way out there to talk to us was more than enough to convince me that St. Louis was the place I wanted to be." ...|$|E

[...] In a later interview with Randall Kenan, Butler explained how debilitating this trauma has been for Americans, especially for African Americans, as symbolized by the loss of her protagonist’s left arm: [...] "I couldn’t really let [...] <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way back. I couldn’t let her return to what she was, I couldn’t let her come back whole and , I think, really symbolizes her not coming back whole. Antebellum slavery didn’t leave people quite whole." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1999 movie Angela's Ashes, teen-aged protagonist Frank McCourt {{explains}} facial bruises he'd {{received in}} a fight to his simple-minded uncle by {{saying that he had}} been punched by [...] "Joe Louis"; the gullible uncle expresses his surprise that [...] "the heavyweight champion of America" [...] would <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to Limerick, Ireland, where the movie takes place, and his dismay that the great fighter would supposedly beat up his scrawny young nephew. (The movie differs from McCourt's underlying autobiographical memoir in this regard; in the book, young McCourt, a fan of the American boxing champion, explains away his injuries to his uncle by saying that he fell down—but he fantasizes about going to America, meeting Joe Louis and having the boxer teach him how to become a powerful fighter, so that McCourt can then return to Limerick to triumphantly beat up the man who actually had hit him in the face.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Lloyd kept {{copyright}} {{control of}} most of his films and re-released them infrequently after his retirement. Lloyd did not grant cinematic release because most theaters could not accommodate an organist, and Lloyd did not wish his work {{to be accompanied by}} a pianist: [...] "I just don't like pictures played with pianos. We never intended them to be played with pianos." [...] Similarly, his features were never shown on television as Lloyd's price was high: [...] "I want $300,000 per picture for two showings. That's a high price, but if I don't get it, I'm not going to show it. They've come close to it, but they haven't <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way up". As a consequence, his reputation and public recognition suffered in comparison with Chaplin and Keaton, whose work has generally been more available. Lloyd's film character was so intimately associated with the 1920s era that attempts at revivals in 1940s and 1950s were poorly received, when audiences viewed the 1920s (and silent film in particular) as old-fashioned.|$|E

[...] Guiscard had <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way from Calabria to command the left. His troops were held in reserve until, seeing Humphrey's forces ineffectually charging the pope's centre, he called up his father-in-law's reinforcements and joined the fray, distinguishing himself personally, even being dismounted and remounting again three separate times, according to William of Apulia. Honored for his actions at Civitate, Guiscard succeeded Humphrey as count of Apulia in 1057, over his elder half-brother Geoffrey. In company with Roger, his youngest brother, Guiscard carried on the conquest of Apulia and Calabria, while Richard conquered the principality of Capua.|$|E
2500|$|Each of {{the regulars}} brought their {{individual}} style to playing the game. Clement Freud liked to make lists and to challenge {{with only a}} few seconds to go. He was among the show's more competitive players, regularly referring to the rules and deprecating any deviation from them. Derek Nimmo often improvised descriptions of his experiences abroad, many derived from his extensive theatrical tours. He too was highly competitive, and was known for berating the chairman frequently. Peter Jones once said that in all his years playing the game, he never quite got the hang of it; nonetheless, his self-deprecating, laconic style suited the essential silliness of the show. Kenneth Williams was often the star of the show: his flamboyant tantrums, arch put-downs, and mock sycophancy made him the audience's favourite. Williams often stretched out his speeches by extending every syllable to breaking point (some words lasting for up to three seconds), and his outbursts of mock-anger regularly included his catchphrase [...] "I've <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way from Great Portland Street", as though he had journeyed for miles, when in fact his home was just {{around the corner from the}} BBC studios where most recordings took place. Merton frequently launches into surreal flights of fancy and fantasy, such as claiming to have had unusual occupations or to have experienced significant historical events. He also often wins points by challenging just before the whistle or for humorous challenges, another technique being to say the same word in the singular and the plural, for inexperienced panelists to falsely challenge.|$|E
2500|$|Big Bethel {{was one of}} {{the first}} Civil War land battles both in present-day Virginia and in the war after the {{bombardment}} and surrender of Fort Sumter. Although arguments have been made that either the Battle of Philippi, on June 3, 1861, in present-day West Virginia (then part of Virginia) or the Battle of Big Bethel was the first land battle of the entire war, the Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1861) took place in Fairfax County, Virginia on June 1, 1861, two days earlier than the Battle of Philippi and nine days before the Battle of Big Bethel. Historian David J. Eicher discounts both the Battle of Fairfax Court House and the Battle of Philippi as [...] "mere skirmishes" [...] and says the first [...] "real land battle of the conflict" [...] was the Battle of Big Bethel, although after a brief summary of the Battle of Big Bethel he characterizes the early Civil War engagements without apparent distinction as [...] "these first minor skirmishes." [...] The Baltimore riot of April 19, 1861 might also be considered a small Civil War battle, with several killed and wounded on each side, but the Confederate side in the affair was a civilian mob, not an organized military force like the force the mob attacked, which was several companies of the 6th Massachusetts Militia. Civilian mobs also were engaged with military forces in two similar riots in St. Louis in the early days of the war after the surrender of Fort Sumter.
