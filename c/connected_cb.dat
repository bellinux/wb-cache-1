The triangle Cb-Cg-Cr is just the xy = (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) triangle in CIE xy chromaticity space. The line <b>connecting</b> <b>Cb</b> and Cr is the alychne. Notice that the spectral locus passes through rg = (0, 0) at 435.8 nm, through rg = (0, 1) at 546.1 nm and through rg = (1, 0) at 700 nm. Also, the equal energy point (E) is at rg = xy = (1/3, 1/3).|$|R
50|$|Coilin {{protein is}} one of the main {{molecular}} components of Cajal bodies (CBs). Cajal bodies are nuclear suborganelles of varying number and composition that are involved in the post-transcriptional modification of small nuclear and small nucleolar RNAs. In addition to its structural role, coilin acts as glue to <b>connect</b> the <b>CB</b> to the nucleolus. The N-terminus of the coilin protein directs its self-oligomerization while the C-terminus influences the number of nuclear bodies assembled per cell. Differential methylation and phosphorylation of coilin likely influences its localization among nuclear bodies and the composition and assembly of Cajal bodies. This gene has pseudogenes on chromosome 4 and chromosome 14.|$|R
50|$|A short four-mile {{connecting}} Railroad {{called the}} Clove Branch was chartered in 1868 and opened in 1869. The <b>CB</b> <b>connected</b> with the D&C near Old Hopewell, {{and its main}} purpose was to haul iron ore out of the mine at Sylvan Lake. Later the CB was extended another four miles and ran passenger and freight service to a few customers and an iron furnace in Clove Valley. The president was the same George H. Brown who was President of the D&C RR. Operations were suspended in 1897 and it was abandoned in 1898.|$|R
50|$|DMH {{explains}} both {{of direct}} one-way causation and indirect one-way causation. Indirect one-way causation indicateds that <b>Cb</b> <b>connects</b> Aad affects to Ab. Direct one-way causation {{refers to the}} process postulated by ATH. DMH is {{in the line of}} the traditional communications theory treatment of message source proposed by Lutz and Swasy (1977). This means that consumers' affective response to an ad influences their propensity to accept the ad claims related to the brand. That is, the more favorable feeling toward the ad the consumers have, the more ad claims they remember. Therefore, the relationship between Aad and Cb can be assumed.|$|R

40|$|Background. Concha bullosa (CB) is pneumatization of {{the middle}} turbinate {{and one of the}} most common {{anatomic}} variation of the sinonasal region. It is found in about 25 % of the population. Middle meatus obstructive syndrome (MMOS) is, usually <b>connected</b> with <b>CB.</b> The main symptoms of this syndrome are headaches, impaired nasal breathing and hyposmia. Headache is the most common symptom and it may occur due to contact between a CB and other structures of the nasal cavity. Case report. We presented a case of 32 year-old-woman with headaches, located in the orbital and the left frontal region. The headaches were intermittent and corresponding to the nasal cycle. After neurologic and alergic examination, endoscopic nasal examination demonstrated a septal deviation to the right side and a large middle turbinate in the left side of the nasal cavity. Coronal computerized tomography (CT) of the paranasal sinuses demonstrated the septal deformation and pneumatization of the left middle turbinate. Diagnosis was confirmed by lidocaine test. In the functional endoscopic surgery (FESS), the lateral lamela of the anterior CB was removed. At the same time, the septoplasty was done. At the control examination, the patient was without symptoms. Conclusion. Although CB is the common anatomic variation of the nasal cavity, MMOS is rare. Headache (rhinogenic origin) is the most important symptom. Surgical treatment is the lateral resection of the CB in the FESS technique and the septoplasty...|$|R
50|$|CB {{radio in}} the UK was {{deregulated}} in December 2006 by the regulatory body Ofcom, and CB {{radio in the}} UK is now licence-free. The old MPT 1320 27/81 band {{will continue to be}} available for the foreseeable future. On 27 June 2014, changes were made by Ofcom to allow the use of AM & SSB modes on CB in the UK legally for the first time. The rules regarding non-approved radios and power levels above 4 watts on AM/FM and 12 W on SSB still apply, despite deregulation. Persons using illegal equipment or accessories still risk prosecution, fines or confiscation of equipment, although this is rarely enforced. AM and SSB on the freeband and amplifier use are common among enthusiasts. Packet radio is legal in the UK, although not widely used. Internet gateway stations are also beginning to appear; although illegal on 27 MHz, these units are <b>connected</b> to other <b>CB</b> stations around the world.|$|R

[UO 2 (1, 5 -nds) (H 2 O) ] (1) crystallizes as a three-dimensional (3 D) framework, with both sulfonate groups coordinated in the O,Oʹ-bridging mode. In the presence of the N-chelating species 2, 2 ʹ-bipyridine (bipy) or 1, 10 -phenanthroline (phen), the three complexes [(UO 2) 2 (1, 5 -nds) (OH) 2 (bipy) 2]H 2 O (2), [(UO 2) 2 (1, 5 -nds) (OH) 2 (bipy) 2]bipy (3) and [(UO 2) 2 (1, 5 -nds) (OH) 2 (phen) 2] (4) were obtained, in which doubly hydroxide-bridged uranyl dimers are assembled into one-dimensional (1 D) chains by bis(unidentate) disulfonate ligands. The complex [Cu(bipy) 2 Cl][UO 2 (2, 7 -nds) (OH) ]H 2 O (5) displays anionic, two-dimensional (2 D) sheets in which unidentate/O,Oʹ-bridging disulfonate ligands link hydroxide-bridged uranyl dimers. In the additional presence of cucurbit[6]uril (CB 6), the complex [(UO 2) 4 Na 4 (2, 7 -nds) 2 (CB 6) Cl 4 O 2 (H 2 O) 10] 5 H 2 O (6) crystallizes as a 3 D framework of intricate architecture, with bis( 3 -oxo) bridged uranyl tetranuclear moieties <b>connected</b> to <b>CB</b> 6 -bound sodium cations by doubly O,Oʹ-bridging disulfonates. Complexes 2 and 4 display intense and well-resolved uranyl emission in the solid state, while nearly complete quenching is observed in 3 and 5...|$|R
40|$|The network enables {{automated}} and {{on-line diagnostics}} of switchgear equipment, especially low and medium voltage circuit breakers (CB). The {{communication in the}} network, within each substation, conforms to IEC 61850. The controlling devices <b>connected</b> with each <b>CB</b> collect sampled data of all electrical signals available at the CB {{and send them to}} the CONCENTRATOR that parameterizes them and carries out an analysis based on the rules contained in an expert system. Methods of CB diagnostics, based on optical technology have also been implemented. The first consists of the detection and conversion to temperature of the infrared emission from the contact bulk. For contact evaluation it is necessary to have an a priori determined heat distribution pattern during normal operation with healthy contact for comparison. The second of the new CB diagnostic methods uses spectral emission analysis and detection of special spectral lines during contact breaking. The contact is composed of two layers made from different materials, one for the contact itself and one for the contact base. The wear of the contact caused by subsequent closures and openings exposes its base layer so that emission lines that characterize the material in the base layer appear in the emission spectrum...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTerbium nitrate was {{reacted with}} 1, 3 -adamantanedicarboxylic acid (LH 2) under solvo-hydrothermal {{conditions}} with either N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) as organic solvents. Hydrolysation {{of the latter}} co-solvents resulted {{in the formation of}} formate or acetate ions, respectively, which are present as co-ligands in the 1 D coordination polymer [Tb(L) (HCOO) (H 2 O) 2] (1) and the 2 D assembly [Tb(L) (CH 3 COO) (H 2 O) ] (2). The increase in dimensionality in the latter arises from the higher connectivity provided by acetate versus formate, the L 2 − ligand being bis-chelating in both cases. The complex [Tb 2 (L) 3 (H 2 O) 5][Tb 2 (L) 3 (H 2 O) 4]· 3 H 2 O (3), another 1 D species, crystallizes alongside crystals of 2. Further addition of cucurbit[6]uril (CB 6), with DMF as co-solvent, gave the two complexes [Tb 2 (L) 2 (CB 6) (H 2 O) 6](NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O (4) and [H 2 NMe 2] 2 [Tb(L) (HCOO) 2] 2 ·CB 6 · 3 H 2 O (5). Complex 4 crystallizes as a 3 D framework in which Tb(L) + chains are <b>connected</b> by tetradentate <b>CB</b> 6 molecules, while 5 unites a carboxylate-bridged anionic 2 D planar assembly and layers of CB 6 molecules with counter-cations held at both portals...|$|R

The requirement that the equal energy point be defined by [...] puts a restriction on the line joining Cb and Cg, and finally, the requirement that the gamut fill the space puts a second restriction on this line to be very close to the gamut in the green region, which specifies the location of Cg and Cb.

40|$|AbstractThe {{cingulum}} bundle (<b>CB)</b> <b>connects</b> gray matter {{structures of}} the limbic system and as such has been implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia. There is growing {{evidence to suggest that}} the CB is actually comprised of a conglomeration of discrete sub-connections. The present study aimed to use Diffusion Tensor tractography to subdivide the CB into its constituent sub-connections, and to investigate the structural integrity of these sub-connections in patients with schizophrenia and matched healthy controls. Diffusion Tensor Imaging scans were acquired from 24 patients diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia and 26 matched healthy controls. Deterministic tractography was used in conjunction with FreeSurfer-based regions-of-interest to subdivide the CB into 5 sub-connections (I 1 to I 5). The patients with schizophrenia exhibited subnormal levels of FA in two cingulum sub-connections, specifically the fibers connecting the rostral and caudal anterior cingulate gyrus (I 1) and the fibers connecting the isthmus of the cingulate with the parahippocampal cortex (I 4). Furthermore, while FA in the I 1 sub-connection was correlated with the severity of patients' positive symptoms (specifically hallucinations and delusions), FA in the I 4 sub-connection was correlated with the severity of patients' negative symptoms (specifically affective flattening and anhedonia/asociality). These results support the notion that the CB is a conglomeration of structurally interconnected yet functionally distinct sub-connections, of which only a subset are abnormal in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, while acknowledging the fact that the present study only investigated the CB, these results suggest that the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia may have distinct neurobiological underpinnings...|$|R
40|$|Silicon is an {{attractive}} material for anodes in energy storage devices, because it has ten times the theoretical capacity of its state-of-the-art carbonaceous counterpart. Silicon anodes can be used both in traditional lithium-ion batteries and in more recent Li-O 2 and Li-S batteries {{as a replacement for}} the dendrite-forming lithium metal anodes. The main challenges associated with silicon anodes are structural degradation and instability of the solid-electrolyte interphase caused by the large volume change (∼ 300 %) during cycling, the occurrence of side reactions with the electrolyte, and the low volumetric capacity when the material size is reduced to a nanometre scale. ^ The simple fabrication technique of emulsion-templated direct assembly, which was reported by Chen et al. (2014) is further developed, by using reduced Graphene Oxide (r-GO) to increase the conductivity and increase the silicon-carbon ratio (Si/C ratio). In this method, Si nanoparticles are confined in the oil phase of an oil-in-water emulsion stabilized by carbon black (CB). These CB nanoparticles are both oil- and water-wettable. The hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance for the CB nanoparticles also causes them to form a network in the continuous aqueous phase. Upon drying this emulsion on a current collector, the CB particles located at the surfaces of the emulsion droplets form mesoporous cages that loosely encapsulate the Si particles that were in the oil. The CB particles that were in the aqueous phase form a conducting network <b>connected</b> to the <b>CB</b> cages. The space within the cages allows for Si particle expansion without transmitting stresses to the surrounding carbon network. Half-cell experiments using this Si/CB anode architecture show a specific capacity of ∼ 1000 mAh/g Si + C and a Coulombic efficiency of 99. 5 % after 50 cycles. This corresponds to a increase to the previous work of over 30 %. Emulsion-templating is a simple, inexpensive processing strategy that directs Si and conducts CB particles to desired spatial locations for superior performance of anodes in lithium ion batteries. ...|$|R
