5|$|Federal appeals <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> {{been divided}} {{on whether the}} Hazelwood case applies to college newspapers, a {{question}} the Supreme Court left open. <b>Courts</b> <b>have</b> also been split on viewpoint-based expression in schools, such as religious expression.|$|E

5000|$|The Superior <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> {{inherent}} {{jurisdiction over}} civil, criminal, and family law matters at common law. [...] Although the <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> inherent jurisdiction, {{the authority of}} the <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> been entrenched in the Canadian Constitution.|$|R
50|$|The Provincial <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> three judges, who sit in Summerside, Charlottetown, Georgetown, and Souris. The <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> {{jurisdiction}} to hear criminal offences and cases contrary to provincial legislation.|$|R

5|$|Its limited {{scope and}} {{the small number of}} {{sentences}} delivered by Indonesian <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> caused numerous observers to call for an international tribunal for East Timor.|$|E
5|$|Post-Skilling, some <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> {{held that}} gratuities may be reached as kickbacks, {{while others have}} held that they may not. Prof. Coffee has argued that honest {{services}} fraud doctrine should explicitly distinguish {{between public and private}} corruption.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>court</b> <b>has</b> {{original}} jurisdiction {{and general}} superintendent control over inferior {{courts in the}} judiciary and agencies, commissions and boards exercising power under the constitution. The <b>court</b> <b>has</b> appellate jurisdiction co-extensive {{with that of the}} state's borders on cases [...] "at law and in equity" [...] except criminal cases, in which the Court of Criminal Appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction. If in any event there is any conflict in determining which <b>court</b> <b>has</b> jurisdiction, the state supreme court is granted the power to determine which <b>court</b> <b>has</b> jurisdiction, with no appeal from the court's determination.|$|R

5|$|As Singapore {{inherited}} English {{administrative law}} upon independence, the Singapore <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> adopted the UK position, holding {{that it is}} necessary to construe the relevant statutory provisions to ascertain whether Parliament has expressed an intention in plain and unequivocal words to take a discretion conferred on the executive out of the precedent fact category.|$|E
5|$|Coke's meaning {{has been}} disputed over the years; some {{interpret}} his judgment as referring to {{judicial review of}} statutes to correct misunderstandings which would render them unfair, while others argue he meant that the common law <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> the power to completely strike down those statutes they deem to be repugnant.|$|E
5|$|In other jurisdictions, <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> applied {{standards}} {{of judicial review}} more exacting than the rational nexus test in Singapore when deciding if a law is unconstitutional. It {{remains to be seen}} whether any of these approaches will be adopted locally.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases such as}} Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, , New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, , R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul (1992) and others, the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> {{addressed}} {{various areas}} of controversial speech. The <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> frequently sided with the speakers, but occasionally the <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> sided {{with the government and}} acknowledged its (limited) power to pass laws protecting citizens from specific types of harmful speech.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> {{original}} jurisdiction, and has general superintendent {{control over}} all inferior {{courts in the}} judiciary, {{as well as all}} agencies, commissions and boards exercising power under the constitution. The <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> appellate jurisdiction co-extensive with that of the state’s borders on all cases “at law and in equity” except criminal cases, in which the Court of Criminal Appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction.

5|$|Scientists and U.S. <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> {{rejected}} this objection on {{the grounds}} that science is not based on appeals to popularity, but on evidence. The scientific consensus of biologists determines what is considered acceptable science, not popular opinion or fairness, and although evolution is controversial in the public arena, it is entirely uncontroversial among experts in the field.|$|E
5|$|The act was {{originally}} intended to discourage the handling of stolen property but several <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> judged that the National Stolen Property Act is sufficiently broad in scope to apply to goods crossing into the United States from a foreign nation, and is therefore applicable {{in the case of}} stolen cultural property.|$|E
5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection {{of some of the}} Bill of Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state and local governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> {{exclusive}} original {{jurisdiction in}} {{first degree murder}} cases and original jurisdiction for all other crimes. It has jurisdiction over all felony matters, although it shares jurisdiction over crimes where other Trial <b>Court</b> Departments <b>have</b> concurrent jurisdiction. Finally, the Superior <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> appellate jurisdiction over certain administrative proceedings.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from its}} general {{equitable}} jurisdiction, the <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> jurisdiction {{over a number}} of other matters. First, the <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> sole power to appoint guardians of the property and person for mentally or physically disabled Delaware residents. Similarly, the Court may also appoint guardians for minors, although the Family <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> coterminous jurisdiction over such matters. Will contests and disputes over interpretations of trusts are also heard by the Court.|$|R
50|$|The Appeals <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> the {{responsibility}} on appeal of determining if the lower District <b>court</b> <b>had</b> evaluated these factors correctly. Instead of merely deciding whether the lower <b>court</b> <b>had</b> abused its judicial discretion, the punitive damages should be reviewed in their entirety. By doing so, the Appeals courts {{would ensure that}} the courts in its circuit applied these standards {{in a uniform manner}} and that citizens would receive uniform treatment.|$|R
5|$|Although the appellants {{argued that}} natural justice had been {{breached}} {{because they had}} not been consulted prior to the issuance of the orders, the High Court observed that where the public interest is at stake the English <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> held that principles of natural justice must apply in a modified manner. In a 1977 case, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the audi alteram partem ("hear the other side") principle {{did not need to be}} complied with if the public interest so demanded.|$|E
5|$|It {{has already}} proven {{difficult}} {{to be recognized as}} having standing when a fix is not used for a controversial appointment. The <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> dismissed suits contesting the appointments of Justice Hugo Black (Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633 (1937)) and Judge Abner Mikva (McClure v. Carter, 454 U.S. 1025 (1981)). Black and Mikva were members of Congress (Black of the Senate, Mikva of the House of Representatives) prior to appointment were appointed without a Saxbe fix. In both cases, the courts held that the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the appointment. Other than these cases, most attempts to gain standing have been considered frivolous lawsuits brought by fringe groups.|$|E
5|$|Lower {{courts are}} split {{on whether the}} Clause {{requires}} that the defendant be tried in a judicial district that was in existence {{at the time the}} crime was committed. Some <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> held that it does. Others have held that it does not and that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial. Even proponents of the former view have found no infirmity when Congress prospectively divides a judicial district, but retains the former configuration for past offenses.|$|E
60|$|This, plainly stated, is your language. Perhaps {{you will}} say the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> decided the disputed Constitutional {{question}} in your favor. Not quite so. But waiving the lawyer's distinction between dictum and decision, the <b>court</b> <b>has</b> decided {{the question for}} you {{in a sort of}} way. The <b>court</b> <b>has</b> substantially said, it is your constitutional right to take slaves into the Federal Territories, and to hold them there as property.|$|R
50|$|In {{criminal}} matters a district <b>court</b> <b>has</b> jurisdiction over all offences except treason, murder and rape, and a regional <b>court</b> <b>has</b> jurisdiction over all offences except treason. A district court can impose {{a fine of}} not more than R120,000 or a prison sentence of not more than three years, while a regional court can impose a fine of not more than R600,000 or a prison sentence of not more than 15 years, except that for certain offences a regional court can also impose a life sentence. In civil matters a district <b>court</b> <b>has</b> jurisdiction where {{the value of the}} claim is R200,000 or less, while a regional <b>court</b> <b>has</b> jurisdiction where the value of the claim is between R200,000 and R400,000. A regional <b>court</b> also <b>has</b> jurisdiction over divorce and related family law matters.|$|R
50|$|The United States Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> {{rejected}} {{the idea that the}} Constitution is a compact among the states. Rather, the <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> stated that the Constitution was established directly by the people of the United States, not by the states.|$|R
5|$|Many <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> {{declined}} {{to assess the}} religious status of Scientology, finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's state {{government}} cannot operate without appropriations under law, as {{mandated by the}} Minnesota Constitution. However, state <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> determined that Priority One and Two Critical Services must continue {{in the event of}} a shutdown. Services that must remain uninterrupted to avoid a potential immediate threat to public health or safety are considered Priority One, and some additional services are designated Priority Two. Before the shutdown, a list of priority services was compiled and prepared by Minnesota Management and Budget, based on recommendations from state agencies.|$|E
5|$|Minton's time on {{the court}} {{marked the end of}} a {{transitory}} period in the judiciary. Since Minton, justices have tended to serve increasingly longer terms on the court, which has had strong political science implications on the Supreme Court. The growing concept of judicial non-partisanship became the norm in American politics after Minton—he was the last member of Congress of be appointed to the court. Linda Gugin and Professor James St. Clair have noted that the federal <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> lost a valuable point of view by not having experienced legislators among their ranks.|$|E
50|$|In the post-apartheid era the Constitutional <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> {{struck down}} two {{attempts}} {{by the government to}} deny the vote to convicted criminals in prison. The <b>court</b> <b>has</b> also ruled that South Africans living outside the country must be allowed to vote.|$|R
50|$|Michigan has no {{statutory}} ban on {{same-sex couples}} adopting, and no Michigan state <b>court</b> <b>has</b> ever interpreted Michigan's statute as prohibiting such adoptions. However {{at least one}} other state <b>court</b> <b>has</b> ruled that unmarried individuals may not jointly petition to adopt.|$|R
50|$|The <b>court</b> <b>has</b> Original Jurisdiction in {{addition}} to its Appellate. The decisions of this court can be appealed only to the Supreme Court of India. The Bombay High <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> a sanctioned strength of 94 judges (71 permanent, 23 additional).|$|R
