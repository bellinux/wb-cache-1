40|$|Adjustable {{compliance}} {{or variable}} stiffness actuators comprise an additional element to elastically decouple the actuator from the load and are increasingly applied to human-centered robotic systems. The advantages of such actuators are {{of paramount importance}} in rehabilitation robotics, where requirements demand safe interaction between the therapy system and the patient. Compliant actuator systems enable the minimization of large contact forces arising, for example, from muscular spasticity and {{have the ability to}} periodically store and release energy in cyclic movements. In order to overcome the loss of bandwidth introduced by the elastic element and to guarantee a higher range in force/torque generation, new actuator designs consider variable or nonlinear stiffness elements, respectively. These components cannot only be adapted to the walking speed or the patient condition, but also entail additional challenges for feedback control. This paper introduces a novel design method for an impedance-based controller that fulfills the control objectives and compares the performance and robustness to a <b>classical</b> <b>cascaded</b> control approach. The new procedure is developed using a non-standard positive-real Η 2 controller design and is applied to a loop-shaping approach. Robust norm optimal controllers are designed with regard to the passivity of the actuator load-impedance transfer function and the servo control problem. <b>Classical</b> <b>cascaded</b> and positive-real Η 2 controller designs are validated and compared in simulations and in a test bench using a passive elastic element of varying stiffness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In the {{centralized}} heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, {{air handling}} units (AHUs) are traditionally controlled by single-loop proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. The control structure is simple, but the performance is usually not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a cascade control strategy for temperature control of AHU. Instead of a fixed PID controller in the <b>classical</b> <b>cascade</b> control scheme, a neural network (NN) controller {{is used in the}} outer control loop. This approach not only overcomes the tedious tuning procedure for the inner and outer loop PID parameters of a <b>classical</b> <b>cascade</b> control system, but also makes the whole control system be adaptive and robust. The multilayer NN is trained online by a special training algorithm—simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) -based training algorithm. With the SPSA-based training algorithm, the weight convergence of the NN and stability of the control system is guaranteed. The novel cascade control system has been implemented on an experimental HVAC system. Testing results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over the <b>classical</b> <b>cascade</b> control system.

40|$|When {{applying}} fuzzy {{systems for}} data analysis, their approximation and interpretation capabilities are two important aspects. Cascaded fuzzy system (CFS) {{is a new}} special class of hierarchical fuzzy systems in architectures proposed by Duan and Chung [IEEE Trans. Fuzzy Syst. 9 (2) (2001) 293] but its universal approximation capability is still not proved. When CFS is utilized in fuzzy data analysis/modeling, it seems very difficult to give a reasonable interpretation for intermediate variables and the corresponding fuzzy rules. A new cascaded centralized TSK fuzzy system (CCTSKFS) is presented in this paper, whose universal approximation capability is proved in detail, and what's more, we can interpret CCTSKFS more rationally.

PrP amino acids 141 - 159 {{has been identified as}} a potential C 1 q binding site; we show, by both surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and ELISA, that C 1 q and its globular region bind to PrP mutagenized in the region of interest with comparable efficiency to that of wild-type protein. To test PrP's ability to activate complement, soluble oligomers of the PrP constructs were made. Only PrP and mutagenized PrP oligomers activate the <b>classical</b> complement <b>cascade</b> while PrP monomer and the C-terminal domain, both in oligomeric and in monomeric form, failed to induce activation.
