5|$|In {{the process}} of {{destroying}} NESTS, he becomes allied with Maxima, a cyborg whose best friend was killed by NESTS agents and is seeking to avenge the death. While Maxima sees K' as a friend and his partner, K' is stoic and cynical. He also meets Whip, who it is revealed is a clone of his sister, Seirah. Even though Whip reveals her identity to K', he ignores this, saying he will do what he pleases. Although he hates The King of Fighters tournaments, he commonly enters them, being asked by someone, or to find NESTS. The participants often criticize him for being antisocial. After destroying NESTS, K' starts recovering his memories, but he suspects he <b>could</b> <b>forget</b> all the people he has met. He also becomes determined to prove he is better than Kyo, instead of being only a clone.|$|E
5|$|Hitler did {{not seem}} overly bothered with {{the outcome of the}} air battle. For him, Sea Lion had also been a huge risk, even with air superiority, and he had been {{convinced}} since the end of August the Luftwaffe would not achieve it anyway. The war with Britain would have to go on. He would maintain the threat of invasion until 1941 through the use of strategic bombing. Then, he would turn against the Soviet Union and eliminate Britain's last possible ally in Europe. With the Soviets defeated, he believed the British would negotiate. On 17 September, he sent out a directive to the three armed services informing them of Sea Lion delay. On this date, the date for S-Day had been 21 September. It was now postponed until further notice. It is likely that Hitler did not want to gamble his new-found military prestige by launching a hazardous venture across the Channel unless the Luftwaffe had crushed all opposition. At the beginning of December 1940, Hitler told the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) that they <b>could</b> <b>forget</b> Sea Lion, although he did not formally cancel the operation until 3 March 1942.|$|E
500|$|The Graves {{children}} lived varied lives. Mary Graves married early, but {{her first}} husband was murdered. She cooked his killer's food {{while he was in}} prison to ensure that the condemned man did not starve before his hanging. One of Mary's grandchildren noted that she was very serious; Graves once said, [...] "I wish I could cry but I cannot. If I <b>could</b> <b>forget</b> the tragedy, perhaps I would know how to cry again." [...] Mary's brother William did not settle down for any significant time.|$|E

500|$|On {{the second}} day, 4th Parachute Brigade's lift of ninety-two C-47s (for the paratroops), forty-nine Horsa and nine Hamilcar gliders (for the artillery, {{vehicles}} and crews), {{were scheduled to}} arrive furthest away from Arnhem on Ginkel Heath drop zone 'Y', {{as early as possible}} on Monday 18September 1944. [...] The brigade's objective was to capture the high ground north-west of Arnhem. In their last briefing before departure, Brigadier Hackett dismissed all officers except for the battalion commanders and the brigade staff and told them;"They <b>could</b> <b>forget</b> what they had been told. Being put down where we were, with surprise gone and the opposition alerted, and given the German capability for a swift and violent response to any threat to what really mattered, they could expect their hardest fighting and worst casualties, not in defence of the final perimeter, but in trying to get there." ...|$|E
500|$|Hubbard is the Guinness World Record holder for {{the most}} {{published}} author, with 1,084 works, most translated book (70 languages for The Way to Happiness) and most audiobooks (185 as of April 2009). According to Galaxy Press, Hubbard's Battlefield Earth has sold over 6 million copies and Mission Earth a further 7 million, with each of its ten volumes becoming New York Times bestsellers on their release; however, the Los Angeles Times reported in 1990 that Hubbard's followers had been buying large numbers of the books and re-issuing them to stores, so as to boost sales figures. Opinions are divided about his literary legacy. Scientologists have written of their desire to [...] "make Ron the most acclaimed and widely known author of all time". The sociologist William Sims Bainbridge writes that even at his peak in the late 1930s Hubbard was regarded by readers of Astounding Science Fiction as merely [...] "a passable, familiar author but {{not one of the}} best", while by the late 1970s [...] "the [...] subculture wishes it <b>could</b> <b>forget</b> him" [...] and fans gave him a worse rating than any other of the [...] "Golden Age" [...] writers.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{facility}} {{was not ready}} {{to be used as a}} hospital, Dr. Ivens was very happy with the location, writing in 1917: [...] "Although within sounds of the guns, its architectural beauty and the forest scenery in the neighbourhood made it an ideal spot in which the wounded soldiers <b>could</b> <b>forget</b> for a time the horrors and discomfort of war," [...] When wards were overfilled, patients were occasionally carted outdoors between May and October.

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of the 1990s, Buck decided to reduce his {{schedule}} to calling only Cardinals home games (or 81 games a year unless there was a special occurrence). Health concerns obviously could have played a factor in this, as Buck suffered from such ailments as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, requiring a pacemaker, cataracts, sciatica, and vertigo. Buck once joked, [...] "I wish I'd get Alzheimer's, then I <b>could</b> <b>forget</b> I've got all the other stuff." [...] In 1998, the Cardinals dedicated a bust of Buck that showed him smiling with a hand cupping his left ear. In 1999, he lent his name to a restaurant venture called J. Buck's, with the restaurant's name being shared with son Joe and daughter Julie.|$|E

2500|$|Some reviewers {{cited the}} film as groundbreaking. Pauline Kael called the film [...] "one of the most gruesomely terrifying movies ever made – and {{when you leave the}} theatre you may wish you <b>could</b> <b>forget</b> the whole horrible experience.... The film's grainy, banal {{seriousness}} works for it – gives it a crude realism". A Film Daily critic commented, [...] "This is a pearl of a horror picture that exhibits all the earmarks of a sleeper." [...] While Roger Ebert criticized the matinée screening, he admitted that he [...] "admires the movie itself". Critic Rex Reed wrote, [...] "If you want to see what turns a B movie into a classic [...] don't miss Night of the Living Dead. It is unthinkable for anyone seriously interested in horror movies not to see it." ...|$|E

There was some fine bowling by Trueman, used in short spurts in the heat, a lovely run out by Harvey in the covers that cut short an auspicious innings by Graveney, some inexpressibly dull batting from Bill Lawry, and a hundred by Brian Booth, that model of a man and of a batsman who tends to be under-rated and forgotten because both he and his cricket were so blamelessly self-effacing. Tall, upright, correct in method, ever-patient, he repeated the hundred he had got at Brisbane, and so gave England a target to go for while all around him were failing. And who <b>could</b> <b>forget</b> the chequered fortunes of Sheppard? ...|$|E

Buck's, with the restaurant's name being shared with son Joe and daughter Julie. One of Buck's final public appearances was on September 17, 2001 at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis. It was the first night that Major League Baseball resumed after the terrorist attacks of September 11. Although looking rather frail (Buck at the time was sick with lung cancer) and struggling to maintain his composure (Buck was obviously showing the signs of Parkinson's disease as well), Buck stirred emotions by reading a patriotic-themed poem during the pregame ceremonies. He concluded by silencing critics who thought baseball had come back too soon: [...] "I don't know about you, but as for me, the question has already been answered: Should we be here? Yes!" [...] Jack Buck died on June 18, 2002, in St. Louis's Barnes-Jewish Hospital from a combination of illnesses. He had stayed in the hospital since January 3 of that year to undergo treatment for lung cancer, Parkinson's disease, and to correct an intestinal blockage.|$|E
