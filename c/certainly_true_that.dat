25|$|However, this is {{certainly}} not entirely true. Gerard cannot have spent much, if any time in prison, as he was appointed permanent counsel by the City of London in October 1554, and represented Wigan in the English parliament {{for the third time}} in 1555. Nor can he have incurred the wrath of Mary, as he was made a Serjeant-at-law, one of a small and extremely powerful group of barristers with exclusive rights to work in the Court of Common Pleas towards the end of her reign - an appointment that lapsed on her death. He was made Justice of the Peace in five counties by 1559, many of them probably in Mary's reign: Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire and Huntingdonshire. However, it is <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> Gerard was much favoured by Elizabeth and one of a small group of lawyers who were quickly installed in important offices to consolidate the new regime.|$|E
500|$|It is <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> Shostakovich borrows {{extensively}} {{from the}} material and styles both of earlier composers and of popular music; the vulgarity of [...] "low" [...] music is a notable influence on this [...] "greatest of eclectics". [...] McBurney traces this to the avant-garde artistic circles of the early Soviet period in which Shostakovich moved early in his career, and argues that these borrowings were a deliberate technique {{to allow him to}} create [...] "patterns of contrast, repetition, exaggeration" [...] that gave his music the large-scale structure it required.|$|E

500|$|The {{story of}} Cynicism {{traditionally}} begins with Antisthenes (c. 445–365 BC), {{who was an}} older contemporary of Plato and a pupil of Socrates. [...] At about 25 years his junior, Antisthenes {{was one of the}} most important of Socrates' disciples. [...] Although later classical authors had little doubt about labelling him as the founder of Cynicism, his philosophical views seem to be more complex than the later simplicities of pure Cynicism. [...] In the list of works ascribed to Antisthenes by Diogenes Laërtius, writings on language, dialogue and literature far outnumber those on ethics or politics, although they may reflect how his philosophical interests changed with time. It is <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> Antisthenes preached a life of poverty: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{refusal to}} meet the ambassadors was later {{prominently}} criticised by the Danish political opposition, twenty-two Danish ex-ambassadors and the Prime Minister's fellow party member, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Uffe Ellemann-Jensen. [...] Hervik wrote, [...] "While it is <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> the prime minister {{did not have a}} legal right to intervene in the editorial process, he could have publicly (as an enactment of free speech) dissociated himself from the publication, from the content of the cartoons, from Rose's explanatory text, from Jyllands-Postens editorial of the same day, and from the general association of Islam with terrorism. Rasmussen did none of those. Instead, he used his interview [...] to endorse Jyllands-Posten's position and the act of publishing the cartoons." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the junior}} {{officers}} in the flank parties had difficulty stopping their exhausted, enraged men from killing everyone they found inside these buildings. For example, two innocent drunks who refused {{to hide in the}} basement of a tavern in Menotomy were killed only because they were suspected of being involved with the day's events. Although many of the accounts of ransacking and burnings were exaggerated later by the colonists for propaganda value (and to get financial compensation from the colonial government), it is <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> taverns along the road were ransacked and the liquor stolen by the troops, who in some cases became drunk themselves. [...] One church's communion silver was stolen but was later recovered after it was sold in Boston. [...] Aged Menotomy resident Samuel Whittemore killed three regulars before he was attacked by a British contingent and left for dead. [...] (He recovered from his wounds and later died in 1793 at age 98.) [...] All told, far more blood was shed in Menotomy and Cambridge than elsewhere that day. The colonists lost 25 men killed and nine wounded there, and the British lost 40 killed and 80 wounded, with the 47th Foot and the Marines suffering the highest casualties. [...] Each was about half the day's fatalities.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the {{scientific}} revolution the qualitative world of book-reading philosophers had been changed into a mechanical, mathematical world to be known through experimental research. Though it is <b>certainly</b> not <b>true</b> <b>that</b> Newtonian science was like modern science in all respects, it conceptually resembled ours in many ways. Many of the hallmarks of modern science, especially with regard to its institutionalization and professionalization, did not become standard until the mid-19th century.|$|R
500|$|Marochetti was {{not popular}} with the Victorian artistic establishment; Punch {{referred}} to him derisively as [...] "Count Marrowfatty", while John Timbs wrote that he [...] "owed more of his success in life to royal and noble patrons than artistic merit." [...] It was <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> he benefited from the patronage of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. His courtly manners impressed Victoria on their first meeting in 1849, and soon afterwards he became involved with the Prince Consort's plans for what became The Great Exhibition of 1851. Several countries planned to display sculptures of romantic historical figures in {{their contributions to the}} exhibition. The genre was common in mainland Europe but relatively rare in England at the time. Marochetti was probably aware that the Belgian sculptor Eugene Simonis intended to show his statue of Godfrey de Bouillon, the leader of the First Crusade, which King Leopold I of Belgium had commissioned. The two men had a number of connections; they shared the same bronze founder, Soyer of Paris, and Simonis was influenced by Marochetti's earlier acclaimed statue of the Duke of Savoy, Emanuele Filiberto. The Italian sculptor was probably motivated by a sense of competition with the Belgian in designing his RichardI.|$|E
2500|$|Now {{that more}} {{is known about}} the trends in {{empirical}} measures of profitability, the debate focuses more on the underlying concepts. Simon Mohun states that the rate of profit is [...] "most easily measured as the proportion of net output not returned as wages to the aggregate fixed capital stock" [...] and that it is this rate of profit that is [...] "generally used in empirical work". If the growth of the gross profit component of value-added (P) is statistically compared with the growth of the estimated fixed capital stock plus inventory holdings (C), it is <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> almost all measures will show that the ratio P/C does drop over time. The real value of the physical capital stock appears to grow faster in real terms than the real value of the operating surplus associated with that physical stock, in the long run. The same effect persists even when various different depreciation techniques are used. The data trend is analogous to a rising tendency of the capital coefficient, where in the course of time more and more capital is required to obtain each additional increase in output. The profit rate rises again, only after a major crisis or a war which destroys a sufficiently large amount of capital value, raises the rate of surplus value, and clears the way for new production techniques.|$|E

Contemporary letters from spies in Constantinople, however, suggest that the plan had always been to take Fort St. Elmo first. In any case, for the Turks to concentrate their efforts on it proved a crucial mistake.|$|R
500|$|It {{is unclear}} when William McKinley began to seriously prepare {{a run for}} president. As Phillips notes, [...] "no documents, no diaries, no {{confidential}} letters to Mark Hanna (or anyone else) contain his secret hopes or veiled stratagems." [...] From the beginning, McKinley's preparations had the participation of Hanna, whose biographer William T. Horner noted, [...] "what is <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> is <b>that</b> in 1888 the two men began to develop a close working relationship that helped put McKinley in the White House." [...] Sherman did not run for president again after 1888, and so Hanna could support McKinley's ambitions for that office wholeheartedly.|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{parameter}} free formulation of ZFC is as strong as ZFC itself.

50|$|As already noted, Ben Nevis {{has long}} been known to hold snow late into the year.

Nevertheless, what is <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> is <b>that</b> snow often persists from one winter to the next. Analysis of Ben Nevis's snow is not as comprehensive as that of the Cairngorms, but recent observations show that the last time Ben Nevis was snow-free was late 2006, snow having survived into each winter from 2007 to 2015. The largest patch, at Observatory Gully, sits at an altitude of around 1130 m. The slightly lower patch at Point 5 gully has also been known to survive from one winter to the next.|$|R

But if the case is that the whole proceeding is a mask—that counsel, jury and judge were swept to the fatal end by an irresistible wave of public passion, and that the State Courts failed to correct the wrong, neither perfection in the machinery for correction nor the possibility that the trial court and counsel saw no other way of avoiding an immediate outbreak of the mob can prevent this Court from securing to the petitioners their constitutional rights.|$|R

50|$|In 1877, {{the local}} Indian Agent was {{required}} {{to deal with a}} petition by several members of the band against Chief Henry Price, asking for his removal.
