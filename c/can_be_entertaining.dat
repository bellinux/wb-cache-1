25|$|Filming of {{an episode}} can usually take a {{considerable}} amount of time to be done and as such, each task is usually filmed back-to-back, rather than weekly as it appears in the broadcast schedule for a series. For each episode, four television crews are used to follow the candidates during a task, and often are focused on picking up on mistakes and issues between candidates, than on their overall performance. The final edit of an episode often trims down a task that took 2–3 days to be done, to fit it within approximately about half of what will be televised for that episode, meaning candidates may appear to make minimal contributions when in reality they made more, while others may not feature as much if Lord Sugar or his advisers feel they did well and completed their duties, as emphasis is often put on moments that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>entertaining</b> for audiences. Often the filming of an episode can hamper the efforts of candidates in a task, due to film crews usually having to get filming permission first from the respective owner of a store or establishment, which can often be a time consuming and cumbersome process as a result, whilst the strict rules of the BBC on product placement and advertising mean candidates have to approach businesses with care when asking them for help.|$|E

Eat Horror panned the film stating, [...] "This is a muddled story with plot holes aplenty and terrible acting even by low budget horror standards.

50|$|CV {{presented}} {{on a video}} clip of 3 to 5 minutes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>entertaining</b> as it will show the job-seeker as friendly and sociable person. It {{can be seen as}} first part of an interview which is to introduce oneself. It may make it possible to reduce the interview time so that a recruiter may be able to know much more about who the applicant is. At the office interview, a candidate will be silent most of the time and will be in a listening mode. He will have very little time to ask questions and tell fully about himself. When a job-seeker has seen the company's videos and webpages and the recruiter has seen him acting on a video, both parties can arrive at a decision on the first face to face interview. The video presentation may be viewed both as a CV and a remote interview.|$|E
