5|$|Borgsen {{contacts}} Black again, confessing {{that his}} latest killing has not satisfied him. Black warns that his urges will only grow, {{and will never}} be satisfied again. When Borgsen hangs up, Black deduces that Vaughan {{is to be the}} next victim. Black, fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) and Sheriff Falkner (John Dennis Johnston) track the kidnapped Vaughan to an equine slaughterhouse. Falkner is attacked and incapacitated by Borgsen as Black locates a still-living Vaughan, who has been hung by her jacket from a meat hook. Black is then confronted by Borgsen, who knocks him down with the cattle prod. Borgsen is about to kill Black with a <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol, but is trampled to death by several escaped horses.|$|E
5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.|$|E
25|$|In Texas, 1980, hitman Anton Chigurh {{strangles}} {{a deputy}} sheriff to escape custody {{and uses a}} <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol to kill a driver and steal his car. He spares {{the life of a}} gas station owner after the owner accepts a challenge and successfully guesses the result of Chigurh's coin flip.|$|E
5000|$|In Islamic and Jewish law, <b>captive</b> <b>bolts</b> {{and other}} methods of pre-slaughter {{paralysis}} {{are generally not}} permissible, as consumption of animals found dead are regarded as carrion and stunned animals that are later killed will come into this category.|$|R
5000|$|On HST {{some parts}} were {{designed}} {{from the start}} as ORUs (and all used <b>captive</b> <b>bolts</b> with a standard 7/16" [...] double height hex head), later when {{it was decided to}} avoid returning HST to earth for repair, more systems and modules were designated as ORUs (but these use a wider variety of fasteners).|$|R
50|$|With cattle, goats, sheep, and horses, a {{penetrating}} stunner {{is typically}} used since it destroys the cerebrum while leaving the brain stem intact; {{this results in}} a more consistently reliable stun, and ensures the animal's heart continues to beat during the bleeding process. <b>Captive</b> <b>bolts</b> allow for meat trimmings from the head to be salvaged. In some veal operations, a non-penetrating concussive stunner is used in order to preserve the brains for further processing.|$|R
25|$|Animals {{are usually}} {{slaughtered}} by being first stunned and then exsanguinated (bled out). Death {{results from the}} {{one or the other}} procedure, depending on the methods employed. Stunning can be effected through asphyxiating the animals with carbon dioxide, shooting them with a gun or a <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol, or shocking them with electric current. In most forms of ritual slaughter, stunning is not allowed.|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} 10 deleted scenes where Homer {{turns on the}} radio {{listening}} to a song about a trucker who crashed his truck out on I-95, and one more {{where some of the}} truckers try to flatten Homer's truck. In order to animate Barclay's truck in [...] "Maximum Homerdrive", Scott bought a model truck, which he also based the design of Barclay's truck on. According to storyboard consultant Mike B. Anderson, the trucks in the episode were very difficult to animate, as the Simpsons animators were still working with traditional cel animation at the time and did not have access to computer tools. In a scene in The Slaughterhouse, an employee is shown killing a number of cows with a <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol, however the death of the cows are not shown. Originally, the writers wanted to show the cows being killed, however when Scott saw the scene in the storyboards, the Simpsons staff instead decided to make the deaths [...] "indirect". During the meat eating contest, Homer becomes exhausted and sees two wine glass holding cows, who appear as [...] "wavy" [...] figures. In order to achieve the [...] "wavy" [...] effect, the Simpsons animators put a ripple glass on the cels and moved it around while shooting the scene. After the contest, Barclay dies of [...] "beef poisoning". The Fox censors were uneasy with including any mention of [...] "beef poisoning" [...] in the episode, as talk show host Oprah Winfrey had recently been sued by [...] "some Texas ranchers" [...] for defaming the beef industry. In a scene in the episode, Homer buys a jar of [...] "Stimu-Crank" [...] pills in order to stay alert while driving during the night. He swallows all the pills at once, to the clerk's dismay. Homer replies, [...] "No problem, I'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills", and proceeds to swallow an entire jar's worth of sleeping pills. According to Scully, the censors had [...] "a lot of trouble" [...] with the scene, but it was included anyhow.|$|E
2500|$|According to Jewish law and Muslim law, [...] "slaughter {{is carried}} out with a single cut to the throat, rather than the [...] methods used in industrialised western plants of {{stunning}} with a bolt into the head (<b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol) for bovines and goats, electric tongs for sheep or an electrified water bath for poultry before slaughter.|$|E
40|$|The present {{design of}} the ECH (Electron Cyclotron Heating) upper port {{launcher}} has been evaluated {{in light of the}} ITER remote handling (RH) requirements. Changes to the launcher design associated with the accessibility, maintainability and manageability of replaceable components are presented. <b>Captive</b> <b>bolts</b> were placed along the flange of the Blanket Shielding Module (BSM). A hinge mechanism was integrated to simplify the (dis-) mounting of the BSM and a frame with incorporated cooling and actuation lines was suggested for simplified mounting and replacement of the steerable mirrors. Rotating the upper port plug upside-down improves maintenance access and component handling. Tools are proposed for manipulation of the port plug and its sub-components. The RH compatibility analysis can improve a design. Early consideration of RH requirements and implementation of necessary features is therefore vital. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|In some {{communities}} animal slaughter and permitted species may {{be controlled by}} religious laws, most notably halal for Muslims and kashrut for Jewish communities. This can cause conflicts with national regulations when a slaughterhouse adhering {{to the rules of}} religious preparation is located in some Western countries. In Jewish law, <b>captive</b> <b>bolts</b> and other methods of pre-slaughter paralysis are generally not permissible, due to it being forbidden for an animal to be stunned prior to slaughter. Various halal food authorities have more recently permitted the use of a recently developed fail-safe system of head-only stunning where the shock is non-fatal, and where it is possible to reverse the procedure and revive the animal after the shock. The use of electronarcosis and other methods of dulling the sensing has been approved by the Egyptian Fatwa Committee. This allows these entities to continue their religious techniques while keeping accordance to the national regulations.|$|R
40|$|Saddle clamp {{modified}} to prevent parts from falling off when installed or removed. Allows easy access for tightening or loosening bolts, and retains alignment with tube mounted in it when opened. All parts are held <b>captive</b> - <b>bolts</b> by retaining washers, floating nuts by pressing and swaging, and upper clamp band by tether. Upper and lower bolt flanges offset {{from each other}} to ensure access...|$|R
2500|$|Chigurh is a hitman with {{no remorse}} or compassion. He is {{described}} by a central character in the novel as a [...] "psychopathic killer," [...] in his 30s, with a dark complexion, and eyes as [...] "blue as lapis ... Like wet stones." [...] His signature weapon is a <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol, which he uses both to kill his victims and to destroy cylinder locks on doors. He also wields a sound-suppressed Remington 11-87 semiautomatic shotgun and pistol (a TEC-9 in the film adaptation). Throughout both the novel and the film, Chigurh flips a coin to decide the fate of his victims. The Remington 11-87 was actually released seven years after the original setting of the book but still made an appearance {{as one of the}} most memorable weapons in the movie.|$|E
2500|$|A parody titled There Will Be Milkshakes for Old Men was {{featured}} in Episode 5 of Season 33 of NBC’s Saturday Night Live, which aired on February 23, 2008. Fred Armisen makes an appearance as Anton Chigurh, complete with <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol and pageboy haircut, mimicking his famous gas stop scene. In addition, Bill Hader does an impression of Daniel Plainview, Daniel Day-Lewis's character from the film There Will Be Blood, and emphasized the line [...] "I drink your milkshake" [...] {{as the basis for}} a Food Network show that finds Plainview traveling the country in search of the perfect milkshake. The same Saturday Night Live episode also featured a parody of No Country for Old Men titled Grandkids in the Movies. Professional wrestler Chris Jericho has stated the heel version of his character debuted in 2008 was directly inspired by Anton Chigurh's calm, indomitable nature.|$|E
2500|$|The Coens {{minimized}} the score {{used in the}} film, leaving large sections devoid of music. The concept was Ethan's, who persuaded a skeptical Joel {{to go with the}} idea. There is some music in the movie, scored by the Coens' longtime composer, Carter Burwell, but after finding that [...] "most musical instruments didn't fit with the minimalist sound sculpture he had in mind [...] he used singing bowls, standing metal bells traditionally employed in Buddhist meditation practice that produce a sustained tone when rubbed." [...] The movie contains a [...] "mere" [...] 16 minutes of music, with several of those in the end credits. The music in the trailer was called [...] "Diabolic Clockwork" [...] by Two Steps from Hell. Sound editing and effects were provided by another longtime Coens collaborator, Skip Lievsay, who used a mixture of emphatic sounds (gun shots) and ambient noise (engine noise, prairie winds) in the mix. The Foley for the <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol used by Chigurh was created using a pneumatic nail gun.|$|E
50|$|On Day 5, {{the second}} spacewalk {{of the mission}} was conducted, this time by first-time spacewalkers Burbank and MacLean. They devoted the day to the final tasks {{required}} for activation of the Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ). The SARJ is an automobile-sized joint {{that will allow the}} station's solar arrays to turn and point toward the sun. Burbank and MacLean released locks that had held the joint secure during its launch to orbit aboard Atlantis. As they worked, the spacewalkers overcame several minor problems, including a malfunctioning helmet camera, a broken socket tool, a stubborn bolt, and a bolt that came loose from the mechanism designed to hold it <b>captive.</b> The stubborn <b>bolt</b> required the force of both spacewalkers to finally remove it.|$|R
2500|$|The best {{dogs are}} kept for {{breeding}} {{and there are}} both industry-associated adoption groups and rescue groups that work to obtain retired racing greyhounds and place them as pets. In the United Kingdom, according to the BBC, one in four retired greyhounds finds a home as a pet. In the United States, prior {{to the formation of}} adoption groups, over 20,000 retired greyhounds a year were killed; recent estimates still number in the thousands, with the industry claiming that about 90% of National Greyhound Association-registered animals are either adopted or returned for breeding purposes (according to the industry numbers upwards of 2000 dogs are still euthanized annually in the US while anti-racing groups estimate the figure at closer to 12,000.) [...] Other greyhounds are sold to research labs, such as Liverpool university animal training school, who have received the remains of dogs killed at Manchester's Belle Vue stadium. A trainer in Lincolnshire was also exposed offering 'slow' dogs to the Liverpool school. Additionally dogs are sent to foreign racetracks such as Spain and sometimes in developing countries. In the North East of England a man is believed to have destroyed as many as 10,000 healthy greyhounds with a <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> gun.|$|E
2500|$|Sheriff Ed Tom Bell {{investigates the}} drug crime {{while trying to}} protect Moss and his young wife, {{with the aid of}} other law enforcement. Bell is haunted by his actions in World War II, leaving his unit to die, for which he {{received}} a Bronze Star. Now in his late 50s, Bell {{has spent most of his}} life attempting to make up for the incident when he was a 21-year-old soldier. He makes it his quest to resolve the case and save Moss. Complicating things is the arrival of Anton Chigurh; a hitman hired to recover the money. Chigurh uses a <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol (called a [...] "stungun" [...] in the text) to kill many of his victims (and to destroy several cylinder locks to open doors), as well as a silenced shotgun. Carson Wells, a rival hitman and ex–Special Forces officer who is familiar with Chigurh, is also on the trail of the stolen money. After a brutal shootout that spills across the Mexican border and leaves both Moss and Chigurh wounded, Moss recovers at a Mexican hospital while Chigurh patches himself up in a hotel room with stolen supplies. While recuperating, Moss is approached by Wells, who offers to give him protection in exchange for the satchel and tells him his current location and phone number, instructing him to call when he has [...] "had enough".|$|E
50|$|Mechanical (<b>Captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol): This method can be {{used for}} sheep, swine, goats, calves, cattle, horses, mules, and other equines. A <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol is applied {{to the head of the}} animal to quickly render them {{unconscious}} before being killed. There are three types of <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistols, penetrating, non-penetrating and free bolt. The use of penetrating captive bolts has, largely, been discontinued in commercial situations to minimize the risk of transmission of disease when parts of the brain enter the bloodstream.|$|E

50|$|<b>Captive</b> <b>bolt</b> : Commonly {{used for}} cattle and other livestock. The bolt is fired through the {{forehead}} causing massive {{disruption of the}} cerebral cortex. In cattle, this stuns the animal, though if left for a prolonged period it will die from cerebral oedema. Death should therefore be rapidly brought about by pithing or exsanguination. Horses are killed outright by the <b>captive</b> <b>bolt,</b> making pithing and exsanguination unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|In {{civilian}} use, the <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol is used {{in agriculture}} to humanely stun farm animals for slaughter.|$|E

5000|$|Between 1974 and 1978 Schulze and {{his colleagues}} carried out a study at the School of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover University in Germany. The study: ‘Attempts to Objectify Pain and Consciousness in Conventional (<b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol stunning) and Ritual (knife) Methods of Slaughtering Sheep and Calves’ is {{reported}} on Islamic websites to have concluded that [...] "the Islamic way of slaughtering is the most humane method of slaughter and that <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning, practiced in the West, causes severe pain to the animal".|$|E
50|$|<b>Captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunners {{are safer}} {{to use in}} most red meat {{slaughter}} situations. There is no danger of ricochet or over-penetration as there is with regular firearms.|$|E
50|$|In the Cormac McCarthy novel No Country for Old Men, and the 2007 film of {{the same}} name, the assassin Anton Chigurh uses an air-powered <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> gun.|$|E
50|$|A <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol or gun (also {{variously}} {{known as}} a cattle gun, stunbolt gun, bolt gun, or stunner) is a device used for stunning animals prior to slaughter.|$|E
50|$|After {{confirmation}} of the first U.S. BSE case, FSIS issued regulations (69 FR 1887, January 12, 2004) prohibiting {{the use of the}} most widely used stunning device (air-injection <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stun gun) because the compressed air device (in contrast to the blank cartridge-driven or non-penetrating <b>captive</b> <b>bolt)</b> has been shown to force pieces of brain and other central nervous system (CNS) tissue into the bloodstream. Cattle blood is processed primarily for use as a protein supplement in animal feeds and milk replacer for calves, and could transmit BSE if it contained specified risk materials (SRMs include brain and CNS tissue).|$|E
50|$|The goal of <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> {{stunning}} is {{to inflict}} a forceful strike {{on the forehead}} with the bolt in order to induce unconsciousness. The bolt {{may or may not}} destroy part of the brain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistols are {{of three}} types: {{penetrating}}, non-penetrating, and free bolt. The use of penetrating captive bolts {{has largely been}} discontinued in commercial situations {{in order to minimize}} the risk of transmission of disease.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{the animal}} is {{rendered}} unconscious by electrical or carbon dioxide stunning and then immediately bled by cutting the throat. For quality reasons, mechanical means of stunning such as a <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol are not recommended.|$|E
50|$|Exsanguination {{is used as}} {{a method}} of slaughter. Before the fatal {{incision}} is made, the animal may be rendered insensible to pain by various methods, including <b>captive</b> <b>bolt,</b> electricity or chemical. Without prior sedation, stunning or anesthetic, this method of slaughter is understood by some to cause a high degree of anxiety, although other studies contradict these findings. The <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> is placed against the skull of the animal, and penetrates to cause tissue destruction in the brain, incapacitating the animal so that the procedure may take place. Electricity is used mostly in porcine, poultry and domestic sheep, whereas chemical is used in injured livestock.|$|E
50|$|Beyond {{the initial}} cost of {{purchasing}} a <b>captive</b> <b>bolt,</b> continued {{usage of the}} method is very inexpensive. The animal is incapacitated {{for the duration of}} the procedure, so it is one of the safest methods for the slaughterer.|$|E
50|$|With percussive {{stunning}}, {{a device}} which hits the animal on the head, {{with or without}} penetration, is employed. Such devices, such as the <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> pistol, can be either pneumatic, or powder-actuated. Percussive stunning produces immediate unconsciousness through brain trauma.|$|E
