25|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{originates}} over the pelvic fins, {{while the second}} dorsal fin originates over the anal fin. The caudal fin is nearly horizontal, with an indistinct lower lobe and a prominent notch near {{the tip of the}} upper lobe. The skin is relatively smooth, as the dermal denticles are small and flattened. The coloration consists of a plain dark background with 78 darker, more or less prominent saddles. Like the related <b>chain</b> <b>catshark,</b> the blotched catshark exhibits fluorescence, with small spots on its back that glow yellow under a blue light.|$|E
2500|$|The blotched {{catshark}} {{was first}} scientifically described in 1966 by American ichthyologist Stewart Springer, {{based on a}} [...] long immature male caught off Cape Canaveral, Florida. He named it after Giles W. Mead, who brought the original specimen to his attention. From 1970 to 1979, this species {{was regarded as a}} subspecies of the <b>chain</b> <b>catshark</b> (S. retifer).|$|E
50|$|Some catsharks, {{such as the}} <b>chain</b> <b>catshark</b> are bioflourescent.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>catshark</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "gorgeous," [...] and [...] "an ideal candidate" [...] for being bred in captivity.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>catshark</b> prefers {{vertical}} {{structures for}} egg deposition and always deposits eggs in pairs. The interval between pairs of eggs ranges {{from a few}} minutes to 8 days. Development rates average 1mm diameter per 7.7 days although temperature has also been seen to affect follicle development.|$|E
50|$|Examples {{of animals}} in the mesopelagic zone are bristlemouth, swordfish, squid, wolf eels, {{cuttlefish}} and other semi-deepsea creatures. The bristlemouth is the Earth's most abundant vertebrate, numbering {{in the hundreds of}} trillions to quadrillions. The small amount of sunlight is sufficient for animals, such as the <b>chain</b> <b>catshark,</b> to be fluorescent.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>catshark</b> or {{chain dogfish}} (Scyliorhinus retifer) is a small, {{reticulated}} catshark that is biofluorescent. The species {{is common in}} the West Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico from George's Bank in Massachusetts, to Nicaragua. It is harmless and rarely encountered by humans. It has very similar reproductive traits to the small-spotted catshark (S. canicula).|$|E
50|$|The blotched {{catshark}} {{was first}} scientifically described in 1966 by American ichthyologist Stewart Springer, {{based on a}} 25 cm long immature male caught off Cape Canaveral, Florida.

From 1970 to 1979, this species {{was regarded as a}} subspecies of the <b>chain</b> <b>catshark</b> (S. retifer).|$|E
50|$|The female <b>chain</b> <b>catshark</b> is able {{to store}} sperm and lay eggs several days after initial copulation. The shark {{has been known to}} store sperm up to 843 days although, there are some {{circumstances}} of poor egg development in eggs laid later. It is suggested that this could be due to a number of factors including, senescence, low sperm viability, or water quality factors.|$|E
50|$|In {{the female}} <b>chain</b> <b>catshark,</b> {{follicle}} {{development has been}} correlated to nidamental gland size, thus, they are considered mature {{when they have a}} fully developed nidamental gland or shell gland. This is marked by the glands growth to 18 mm or more in width. Sexual maturity in the female is seen at 520 mm in length under normal conditions. There has been evidence however that some northern populations of the shark may mature at a smaller size (410 mm).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>catshark</b> {{is one of}} four elasmobranch species {{shown to}} {{possesses}} biofluorescent properties. The researchers of the study examined the vision of Scyliorhinus retifer using microspectrophotometry and designed a [...] "shark-eye" [...] camera that yielded contrast information on areas where fluorescence is anatomically distributed on the shark. The repeated evolution of biofluorescence in elasmobranchs, coupled with a visual adaptation to detect it; and evidence that biofluorescence creates greater luminosity contrast with the surrounding background, highlights the potential importance of biofluorescence in elasmobranch behavior and biology.|$|E
50|$|The {{catshark}} {{spends the}} daytime resting at the bottom, usually {{in contact with}} certain structures. It has been observed with large burrowing cerianthid anemone tubes and boulders. The bottom rubble {{is thought to be}} used as a camouflage with the sharkâ€™s spotted surface. Adult sharks tend to prefer rough bottoms, creating a difficulty for trawl sampling, while the immature forms are found near smoother regions. The <b>chain</b> <b>catshark</b> has been known to feed on squid, bony fish, polychaetes and crustaceans. In aquaria, they are relatively motionless, only swimming occasionally.|$|E
50|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{originates}} over the pelvic fins, {{while the second}} dorsal fin originates over the anal fin. The caudal fin is nearly horizontal, with an indistinct lower lobe and a prominent notch near {{the tip of the}} upper lobe. The skin is relatively smooth, as the dermal denticles are small and flattened. The coloration consists of a plain dark background with 7 - 8 darker, more or less prominent saddles. Like the related <b>chain</b> <b>catshark,</b> the blotched catshark exhibits fluorescence, with small spots on its back that glow yellow under a blue light.|$|E
40|$|I {{prepared}} a histological description of Scyliorhinus retifer, the <b>chain</b> <b>catshark,</b> {{to show that}} the digestive tissues resemble those of other vertebrates. After taking ten tissue samples, I prepared them for observation. I observed my slides using light microscopy and took photomicrographs. My results show similarities between the digestive tissues of Scyliorhinus retifer and those of other vertebrates. These results indicate similar function of the digestive systems as well as a common ancestor...|$|E
