This is done {{in order to develop}} the discrimination parameters of different genetic gases. Eight samples, including six mudstones with type II 1 and type I organic matter and two coals, were analyzed by PY-GC. On the other hand, the sixteen typical coal-derived gases and sixteen oil-associated gases were analyzed by GC. The results show that there exists a great difference in the ratio of 2 -methylheptane and 1 -cis- 3 -dimethylcyclohexane in coal-derived gases, oil-associated gases, and source rock absorbed gases. The ratio in coal-derived gases is less than 0. 5, whereas it is higher than 0. 5 in oil-associated gases. In addition, there are also differences in the relative composition of C 8 normal alkanes, isoparaffin, and <b>cycloparaffin</b> in coal-derived and oil-associated gases. Coal-derived gas is characterized by high <b>cycloparaffin</b> content that is generally higher than 40 %, while the oil-associated gas exhibits low <b>cycloparaffin</b> content that generally less than 40 %, as well as high isoparaffin content.

40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} and model predictions of ignition delay times for single component and two-component liquid fuels are presented. The methodology used is the suspended-droplet/moving-furnace technique, {{in which a}} droplet of fuel is suspended {{from the tip of}} a thin quartz fibre. A preheated electric furnace moves towards and encompasses the droplet locality, producing a sudden rise in ambient temperature, and thus initiating the ignition process. The entire apparatus is enclosed in a pressure vessel and is remotely operated. Data were collected for pressures up to 18 atm absolute and in a temperature range of 773 K to 973 K. Fuels tested comprised n-paraffins (decane, dodecane, and hexadecane), aromatics (mesitylene, o-xylene, and isobutylbenzene) and a <b>cycloparaffin</b> (decalin), as well as selected binary combinations: n-decane/n-dodecane, n-dodecane/n-hexadecane, n-decane/decalin, n-decane/isobutylbenzene, n-decane/mesitylene, and n-decane/o-xylene. Paraffin measurements at low pressures and high temperature revealed a monotonic decrease in ignition times with increasing pressure. However, higher pressure ignitions at lower temperatures showed more complex behaviour by the measurement of two or "twinned" ignition times for the same pressure and temperature condition, indicating a change in reaction mechanism, possibly from one-stage to two-stage ignition. Aromatic fuels did not show "twinned" ignition time behaviour and responded with a slight increase in ignition times with increasing pressure, owing to a weaker reaction rate dependence on pressure. The <b>cycloparaffin</b> behaved analogously to the n-paraffin family. The behaviour of mixtures was largely controlled by the more volatile component. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E

It is also important to notice that although decalin presents good O-ring swelling ability, it does not mean all cycloparaffins have the same property. n-decane also showed certain O-ring swelling ability but its main effect during the polymer-fuel interaction process is to extract materials out of nitrile O-ring.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{interesting}} {{problems associated with}} the thermal oxidation of hydrocarbons. The relationship between rate and structure is remarkable, the temperature dependence is anomalous and the kinetics are both complex and not fully understood. There is often a long induction period associated with the development of branching chains, during which time intermediates, such as peroxides and aldehydes, are built up in small quantity. The reaction is also very much subject to the influence of small homogeneous and heterogeneous additions. This means that not only can ignition be promoted, but by suitable means delayed or prevented, a subject of very great practical importance. The objective of the work here described has been to investigate the gas phase oxidation of a series of cycloparaffins and to compare the kinetics with similar open chain systems. Particular reference has been made to the problems of the rate-structure relationship and the effect of surfaces, both on the induction period and on the rate. The systems studied for this purpose have been a aeries of cycloparaffins from cyclopropane to cyolooctane, excluding cyclobutane but including various methyl substituted cyclopentanes and hexanes. The more detailed study of the kinetics and of the relevant inhibition phenomena been restricted to cyclopentane, n-pentane being used to provide comparison with the open chain paraffins. The work was carried out to a conventional static apparatus at pressures from 100 to 700 mm Hg, reaction vessels being of pyrox or silica. The course of the reaction was followed by pressure increase, measured on a mercury manometer. Product analysis by mass spectrometer, gas chromatography and chemical methods showed that pressure changes were a good measure of the extent of the reaction. Oxidation reactions in the gas phase have an anomalous temperature dependence resulting in "high" and "low" temperature regions of of reaction. Most of the present investigation has been carried out in the low temperature range, below 500 °C, with a little comparative work done at higher temperatures. It was first considered desirable to make some comparison of n-pentane and cyclopentane, since the oxidation of the normal paraffins has already been investigated, and the comparison would show how far results could be regarded as general. These experiments were carried out at 230 °C, with variation of both the hydrocarbon and oxygen pressures. In general the kinetics of the two paraffins are very similar. The reciprocal induction period was in all cases linearly proportional to the pressure of hydrocarbon or oxygen, the dependence being a little steeper with increasing hydrocarbon pressure than oxygen pressure. The dependence upon reactant pressure of the rate was found to be more complex. There is a limiting pressure of either hydrocarbon or oxygen above which increase in the pressure of the other reactant causes a rapid rise in rate to explosion. Below this critical pressure the rate attains a limiting value with increase either in oxygen or in hydrocarbon. Thus under certain conditions the rate becomes independant of the concentration of one reactant. The change from one type of behaviour to the other is gradual, and there is a region where the rate is linearly proportional to the concentration of one reactant over a wide pressure range. This type of behaviour was observed with several hydrocarbons. It had been previously supposed that with n-pentane the rate attained a limiting value with increase of oxygen, but it now appears that this is not always so. The comparison of a series of cycloparaffins was made at 250 Â°C (except cyclopropane which was investigated at a higher temperature). The rate increases with the size of the ring, {{in the same way as}} it does in the open chain paraffins with length of the chain. The only anomaly observed was with cyclooctane, which oxidised at a rate between cyclopentane and cyclohexane. Methyl groups on the ring, as in branched open chain paraffins, progressively lower the rate. The effect of increasing the surface to volume ratio of the reaction vessel, was investigated. Fourfold and sixfold increases lengthened the induction period by a small amount and decreased the rate, besides raising the limiting pressures mentioned above. Much higher pressures ware attained before the rate accelerated to explosion, and in some cases a limiting rate replaced an explosion. The result of various small homogeneous additions was next investigated. Peroxides, aldehydes and some halogens all shorten the induction period and in most cases increase the rate. This is thought to be due to the rapid production of radicals which initiate the main reaction. Isopropyl halides had little or no affect on the induction period or rate, aniline, carbon tetrachloride and carbon tetrafluoride had none. Inert gases in the form of nitrogen and carbon dioxide had no effect, even in large amounts. Experimental evidence suggests that the initiation reaction may take place largely on the surface of the containing vessel. In order to try and utilise this fact for the suppression of the reaction, various surface treatments were investigated. These consisted in coating the inside of the reaction vessel with a thick layer of various salts, deposited from an aqueous solution. Those used were a series of alkali halides and some salts of di- and tri- valent metals. In the first instance experiments on the length of the induction period were carried out between 250 °C and 290 °C. All the salts caused a increase in the induction period (θ) and Arrhenius plots of log 1 /θ against 1 /T abs. gave straight lines. The magnitude of this effect was large, induction periods being increased by up to a thousandfold. Some investigations were made on the rate of reaction at 250 °C and on account of the length of the induction period at this temperature, a trace of ditertiary butylperoxide was used as an initiator. Only a few of the less efficient salts gave a measurable rate, which was from 10 % to 50 % of the normal value. The others gave no measurable pressure increase, even with large amounts of initiator. It was further discovered that in the case of at least two salts, a few grams of the loose salt in a clean pyrex vessel had the same inhibiting effect as coating the whole interior of the vessel. This type of inhibition is not confined to salts, since silver wire, platinum wire and gold foil also inhibit the reaction. The temperature coefficient of the reaction was next investigated with cyclopentane in both salt-coated and uncoated vessels, and is anomalous. Two sections of smooth reaction are separated by a temperature region of cool flames and explosion. On raising the temperature the rate first increases and then gives way to explosion: this is succeeded by cool flames which as the high temperature region is approached give way to a smooth reaction with a negative temperature dependence. Eventually this becomes positive again and the rate finally rises to explosion. The whole process occurs over a temperature rang* of about 250 °C. The induction periods show no anomalous behaviour, and give one Arrhenius plot through both high and low temperature with no break in the cool flame portion. Similar experiments were carried out with salt-coated vessels. With lithium bromide the rate in the high temperature region was little affected, but at lower temperatures where cool flames might be expected, a very marked reduction in rate was noticed. Magnesium sulphate caused a large reduction in rate in the high temperature region. The principal reaction products were carbon monoxide and water with some carbon dioxide, others being in very low concentrations, Other products and intermediates detected were formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, n-butyric aldehyde, butene and an unidentified peroxide or peroxides. The concentration of the principal products followed the rate of pressure rise closely. The peroxide concentration (determined by an iodometric method) passed through a well defined maximum at the time of maximum rate. In the cool flame and explosion region the peroxide concentration rose with the pressure increase and immediately after the explosion fell back to a lower value. In salt-coated vessels the peroxide concentration was most markedly reduced, both at low and high temperatures. The interpretation of these results will now be considered. The kinetics of the cycloparaffins seem to be analogous to those of the n-paraffin series. The reactants can apparently both start and end chains, since under certain conditions the rate can become independent of the concentration of one reactant, and even be depressed with increasing oxygen pressure. The general shape of the rate/pressure curves can be given by a simple empirical expression of the form:- [For the equation omitted here, please consult the PDF. ] It is suggested that the progressive change in mode of reaction from low to high temperature occurs thorough the increased rate of of RO 2 radicals thus :- Low High RH + O 2 → R + HO 2 RH + O 2 → R + HO 2 R + O 2 → RO 2 R + O 2 → RO 2 RO 2 + RH → ROOH + R RO 2 → aldehydes → products ROOH → branching → products The cool flames are probably formed by the decomposition of the peroxide. The peroxide found experimentally at high temperatures is possibly hydrogen peroxide and not an organic peroxide. The peroxide postulated at low temperature may well be a cyclic one and the cyclic peroxy radicals of the high temperature mechanism would split to give one free radical and probably an aldehyde. The fact that the ring has to be broken means that there is a fundamental difference from the n-paraffins at some stage, although the resulting kinetics seem to be the same. The anomalous form of the temperature coefficient is typical of the oxidation of higher hydrocarbons and shows that two separate mechanisms oust exist, one showing a decrease in rate as the temperature is increased over a certain range. The structural effects in the cycloparaffins are again very similar to those in the n-paraffin series, methyl groups strongly decreasing the rate. This is probably due, either to the stabilising influence they have on a peroxide intermediate, or to the production of some more stable intermediate from the easily attacked tertiary carbon atoms. Increase in the surface/volume ratio of the reaction vessel indicates that chain ending on the walls can control the reaction to a large extent. The addition of almost any material which can produce free radicals under the conditions of the experiment, (e. g. aldehyde or peroxide) reduces the length of the induction period and in large amounts raises the rate. Evidently there are many free radicals capable of initiating the chain and if these are produced over a period of time, as in the oxidation of an added aldehyde, their concentration can become large enough to upset the kinetic balance of the reaction and so raise the total rate. The effect of a salt coating on the reaction vessel walls is of great interest. It seems very unlikely that the initiation reaction is interfered with in any my, since both metal wires and loose salt are as efficient as a complete coating. The inhibition must occur through the destruction of an intermediate, possibly a peroxide, since this has a half life time longer than that of the transient free radicals. Salt and metal surfaces might, however, destroy assail radicals of the type HO 2. Peroxide removal would explain the fact that the efficiency falls off as the temperature is raised towards the high temperature region. The analytical results having shorn that the rate of pressure change is a good measure of the extent of reaction and that the concentration of intermediates is always very small, the <b>cycloparaffin</b> ring must break to give radicals or fragments that are very rapidly converted to final products. From the point of view of the control or prevention of ignition the most significant results may be summarised as follows. Rapid reaction depends upon the slow build up of active intermediates. These are susceptible, in principle, to destruction both by homogeneous additions and by surface action. Homogeneous additions of an effective kind have proved difficult to find. On the other hand a considerable variety of surfaces exert a most marked effect in prolonging the induction period, in some cases almost indefinitely. The action is not improbably connected with the destruction of the intermediate peroxides. The chains by which reaction is propagated almost certainly are initiated on the vessel walls but prevention of this initiation does not seem to be the method of action of the inhibitors. Therefore the control of ignition by salts would be expected to be most effective when the salt is widely distributed thorough the gas. These considerations perhaps indicate the best lines of future work. </p...|$|E

30|$|Since the {{introduction}} of turbine powered aircraft approximately 70  years ago, the aviation industry {{has grown from a}} novelty to an essential need [1].

Furthermore, conventional crude oil derived jet fuel is also becoming more expensive due to volatile markets [4]. The aforementioned environmental and cost factors, in combination with aspects such as energy security and the continued availability of crude oil, have placed renewed focus on the development of alternative/synthetic jet fuels by industry role players.

25|$|Almost all of {{the organic}} {{hydrogen}} is exchangeable to some extent. Isotopic exchange of organic hydrogen will reorder the distribution of deuterium and often incorporate external hydrogen. Generally, more mature materials are more substantially exchanged. With effective exchange, aliphatic hydrogen can finally reach isotopic equilibrium at the final stage. Equilibrium fractionation factor varies among different hydrogen sites. For example, aliphatic hydrogen isotope fractionation depends on the carbon atom that the hydrogen atom bonds with. To the first order, alkyl hydrogen isotope composition follows this trend: δDPrimary carbon < δDSecondary carbon < δDTertiary carbon. The fractionation factors between carbon sites also decrease with increasing temperature. This can be potentially used as a thermo-history indicator. The fractionation between whole molecule and water can be estimated by averaging all hydrogen-positions, and {{this leads to a}} relatively small variation of equilibrium fractionation between different groups of hydrocarbons and water. A theoretical prediction estimated this to be -80‰ to -95‰ for steranes, -90‰ to -95‰ for hopanes, and -70‰ to -95‰ for typical <b>cycloparaffins</b> between 0°C to 100°C. At the temperature of the oil window and gas window, the equilibrium fractionation between different group of organic molecules is relatively small, as compared with large primary signals.|$|R
40|$|Petroleum-derived {{substances}} {{are complex}} and composed of aliphatic (normal-, iso-, and <b>cycloparaffins),</b> olefinic, and/or aromatic constituents. Approximately 400 of these complex substances were evaluated {{as part of the}} US Environmental Protection Agency voluntary High Production Volume (HPV) Challenge program. The substances were separated into 13 groups (categories), and all available data were assessed. Toxicology testing was conducted as necessary to fully address the end points encompassed by the HPV initiative. In a broad sense, volatile hydrocarbons may cause acute central nervous system effects, and those that are liquids at room temperature pose aspiration hazards if taken into the lungs as liquids and may also cause skin irritation. Higher boiling substances may contain polycyclic aromatic constituents (PACs) that can be mutagenic and carcinogenic and may also cause developmental effects. Substances containing PACs can also cause target organ and developmental effects. The effects of aliphatic constituents include liver enlargement and/or renal effects in male rats via an a- 2 u-globulin-mediated process and, in some cases, small but statistically significant reductions in hematological parameters. Crude oils may contain other constituents, particularly sulfur- and nitrogen-containing compounds, which are removed during refining. Aside from these more generic considerations, some specific petroleum substances may contain unusually toxic constituents including benzene, 1, 3 -butadiene, and/or n-hexane, which should also be taken into account if present at toxicologically relevant levels...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{jet fuels}} have been {{proposed}} as alternatives to petroleum Jet A- 1. Compatibility issues, however, are of concern; specifically the interaction of synthetic fuels with polymeric materials which are commonly used to seal fuel systems. This is because of differences between the composition of synthetic fuels and petroleum-derived fuels. Synthetic fuel streams contain no or very low aromatics, unlike petroleum-derived fuels. This investigation was consequently initiated to gain {{a greater understanding of}} the factors affecting seal swell in the aviation industry. The study focussed interactions between fuel components from various fuel classes and nitrile rubber (NBR) as well as a restricted set of investigations on fluorocarbon (FKM) rubber. No comprehensive study of the temperature sensitivity of fuel composition on swelling has been attempted prior to this study. NBR and FKM were swollen in petroleum Jet A- 1, synthesised paraffinic kerosene (SPK) and a variety of blends of pure components with SPK. These components were selected from aromatic species (monoaromatic, diaromatic and heterocyclic), <b>cycloparaffins,</b> aromatic oxygenates and other oxygenates. Aromatic species were blended at 8 % (v/v) while all other species were blended at 15 % (v/v). Within the class of aromatic hydrocarbon components, it was found that decreasing molecular size, increasing the number of ring structures (particular aromatic rings) as well as increasing all Hansen solubility parameters increased swelling. Of the Hansen solubility parameters, the greatest correlation was found with the hydrogen-bonding (electron exchange) parameter. Nonetheless the dispersion parameter which is strongly affected by the number of aromatic rings and length of any aliphatic side-chain was also important. A very good correlation was found between swelling and the density of the aromatic species. It was found furthermore that introducing oxygen atoms increased swelling. The introduction of <b>cycloparaffins</b> also increase swelling although to a much lesser extent than aromatics. Cyclisation together with a polar moiety was observed to increase swell significantly. With FKM elastomers, fuel composition had less influence. Temperature sensitivity was explored by performing swelling at 20 oC, 35 oC and 50 oC. Van't Hoff plots were used to obtain enthalpies of mixing. It was found that all hydrocarbons swelled more as temperature rose. This is indicative of endothermic interactions between these species and polar NBR. However, it was observed that species with high polar and hydrogenbonding Hansen solubility parameters had lower sensitivity to temperature. It is postulated that in these species, less aromatic concentration in the NBR occurs at elevated temperatures, contributing to lower sensitivities. Aromatic oxygenates were observed to decrease in swelling with temperature. This is ascribed to a strong exothermic interaction. This behaviour was in contrast to non-aromatic oxygenates. It is possible that blends of these non-aromatic oxygenates with SPK are less stable at elevated temperatures leading to component separation into the NBR and thus more swelling. Similar trends were observed with fluorocarbon elastomers (FKM). Physical property measurements were made on swollen NBR O-rings. A distinct relationship between decreased glass transition temperature and the extent of swelling was observed. Fuel which had adsorbed into the elastomer was observed to act as an effective plasticiser. Not only did increased swelling lower the glass transition temperature but it reduced the modulus of NBR O-rings in a predictable fashion. A significant decrease in storage modulus was associated with increased swelling. Increased swelling was found to be associated with increased compression set although the mechanism by which this manifests itself is unclear...|$|R
40|$|Exhaust {{materials}} {{were collected from}} a four-cylinder automobile engine that con-sumed 1 quart of lubricating oil for each 5 gal of gasoline. The oily condensate was separated into three fractions. These fractions contained paraffins, olefins, and <b>cycloparaffins</b> as fraction I, aromatics as fraction II, and non-hydro-carbons and oxygenated compounds as fraction III. The solvents produced no noticable effects on test mice after 279 days of testing. Fractions I and II produced ulcerated sores which formed thick scabs. Fraction II also produced {{a small amount of}} cancerous cells at the site of application. Fraction III pro-duced thin scabs and was associated with hyperirritability and other evidence of central nervous system changes. This fraction was lethal in doses of 100 mg per week. A search of the literature discloses that little work had been reported prior to 1952 on the analysis of non-gaseous materials exhausted from internal combustion engines. Maillard and Friedrich (1937) found that when gasoline was burned under certain conditions, acetic and formic acids, formaldehyde, acrolein, and phenol could be detected in the products of combustion. Maillard (1937) ex-amined the oily and water layers condensed from automobile-engine exhaust fumes and identified acids, aldehydes, and neutral cracked hydrocarbons, but he did not examine these further. Passano (1942) found that some combustion products of fuel oil and high-boiling petroleum fractions were capable of producing carcinogenic tumors in rats. Cook, Hewett, and Hieger (1933), in studying the high incidence of cancer cases among workers of the coal tar industry, discovered that polycyclic aromatic compounds, especially those containing from two to six fused benzene rings, were the principle carcinogenic agents...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{interpretation}} of stable hydrogen isotope ratios (^ 2 H/^ 1 H) in organic compounds is greatly aided by {{knowledge of the}} relevant equilibrium fractionation factors (ε_(eq)). Previous efforts have combined experimental measurements and hybrid Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to accurately predict equilibrium fractionations in linear (acyclic) organic molecules (Wang et al., 2009 a and Wang et al., 2009 b), but the calibration produced by that study is not applicable to cyclic compounds. Here we report experimental measurements of equilibrium ^ 2 H/^ 1 H fractionation in six cyclic ketones, and use those data to evaluate DFT calculations of fractionation in diverse monocyclic and polycyclic compounds commonly found in sedimentary organic matter and petroleum. At 25, 50, and 75 °C, the experimentally measured ε_(eq) values for secondary and tertiary H_α in isotopic equilibrium with water are in the ranges of − 130 ‰ to − 150 ‰ and + 10 ‰ to − 40 ‰ respectively. Measured data are similar to DFT calculations of εeq for axial H_α but not equatorial H_α. In tertiary C_α positions with methyl substituents, this {{can be understood as}} a result of the methyl group forcing H_α atoms into a dominantly axial position. For secondary C_α positions containing both axial and equatorial H_α atoms, we propose that axial H_α exchanges with water significantly faster than the equatorial H_α does, due to the hyperconjugation-stabilized transition state. Interconversion of axial and equatorial positions via ring flipping is much faster than isotopic exchange at either position, and as a result the steady-state isotopic composition of both H’s is strongly weighted toward that of axial H_α. Based on comparison with measured ε_(eq) values, a total uncertainty of 10 – 30 ‰ remains for theoretical ε_(eq) values. Using DFT, we systematically estimated the ε_(eq) values for individual H positions in various cyclic structures. By summing over all individual H positions, the molecular equilibrium fractionation was estimated to be − 75 ‰ to − 95 ‰ for steroids, − 90 ‰ to − 105 ‰ for hopanoids, and − 65 ‰ to − 100 ‰ for typical <b>cycloparaffins</b> between 0 and 100 °C relative to water. These are distinct from the typical biosynthetic fractionations of − 150 ‰ to − 300 ‰, but are similar to equilibrium fractionations for linear hydrocarbons (Wang et al., 2009 b). Thus post-burial H exchange will generally remove the ∼ 50 – 100 ‰ biosynthetic fractionations between cyclic isoprenoid and n-alkyl lipid molecules, which can be used to evaluate the extent of H exchange in sedimentary organic matter and oils...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the changes in the organic matter of a typical organic shale caused by {{extremely}} low grade, or incipient, metamorphism and to interpret the geothermal history of the study area. The samples are from the Mancos Shale, taken from an area near Crested Butte, Colorado, where the sediments have been intruded by igneous rocks of Tertiary age and subjected to contact metamorphism. Samples were taken from near the main intrusive trend outward, along the East River and the Slate River, and from near Glenwood Springs, about fifty miles to the north, in order to provide an approximately gradational temperature profile. The bitumen was extracted from the crushed rock by soxhlet extraction with benzene. The extracts were separated into saturate and aromatic fractions via elution chromatography with hexane and benzene, respectively. The saturate fractions were analyzed using gas chromatography. Organic carbon was determined by combusting crushed samples in an induction furnace and measuring the evolved CO 2. The principal conclusions drawn from this study were: (1) Metamorphism drastically reduces the amount of extractable bitumen in organic shales. (2) Hydrocarbon content is much more drastically reduced by metamorphism than is organic carbon, i. e., metahydrocarbon morphism reduced the ratio. (3) No relationship organic carbon between metamorphism and saturate/aromatic ratio was found in the Crested Butte samples. (4) Aromatic fractions from metamorphosed samples were lighter in color than those from unmetamorphosed samples. (5) The n-paraffins between C 16 and C 33 from the unmetamorphosed samples were rather evenly distributed, while those from metamorphosed samples were predominately C 16, C 17, C 18, and C 19. Metamorphism decreases the average molecular weight of the n-paraffins. (6) The carbon preference index for the unmetamorphased samples was close to 1. The hydrocarbons were probably somewhat mature before metamorphism occurred. (7) Metamorphism causes an increase in the ratio of iso- and <b>cycloparaffins</b> to normal paraffins. (8) Increased induration of shale and the disappearance of swelling clays were associated with metamorphism. (9) All of the noted changes occurred in approximately the same region, about five to seven miles from the main intrusive trend. The samples from between five and fifteen miles of the intrusive trend resembled the unmetamorphosed samples from Glenwood Springs more closely than they did the samples from within five miles of the trend. Thus, the profile probably does not represent a gradation in temperature, but rather defines two zones, one metamorphic and one submetamorphic. (10) The region of metamorphism may delineate the boundaries of a subjacent igneous mass related to other regional structures...|$|R
