50|$|The Family of <b>Chimps</b> (Dutch: <b>Chimps</b> onder elkaar) is a 1984 Dutch {{documentary}} film directed by Bert Haanstra. The {{film is a}} study of the behaviour of a family <b>chimps</b> in Burgers' Zooin Arnhem in the Netherlands. The documentary was inspired by a book called Chimpansee politiek (Chimpanzee politics) written by primatologist and ethologist Frans de Waal.|$|R
50|$|Caught up in {{the turmoil}} of war-torn countries, <b>chimps</b> {{frequently}} become orphans of the bushmeat trade, sold at markets or auctions, according to Animal Planet. <b>Chimps</b> also are caged for entertainment or chained as pets. With only about 150,000 <b>chimps</b> remaining in the wild, the chimpanzee population is being destroyed {{and the lives of}} these creatures are being degraded.|$|R
5|$|Bubbles was {{initially}} kept at the Jackson family's home in Encino, Los Angeles, but {{was moved to}} Neverland Ranch in 1988. There, he slept in a crib in Jackson's bedroom, used the singer's toilet and ate candy in the Neverland movie theater. By 2003, like many captive chimpanzees, Bubbles had matured into a large and aggressive adult <b>chimp</b> unsuitable as a companion animal. He {{was sent to a}} California animal trainer. When the trainer closed his operation in 2004, Bubbles was moved to the Center for Great Apes, a sanctuary in Wauchula, Florida, where he has lived since 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons try to {{hold the}} poachers but {{eventually}} they break into the sanctuary. The poachers are revealed to be Greenpeace activists, who prove that Dr. Bushwell is actually a <b>chimp</b> slave master, exploiting their labor at a nearby diamond mine. Worried that the Simpsons will report her to the authorities, Dr. Bushwell offers everyone diamonds as a bribe - which all the Simpsons except Lisa happily accept. On the plane ride back to Springfield, it is revealed that their former tour guide, Kitenge, is {{now president of the}} country, with the former president now the Simpsons' flight attendant.|$|E
5|$|The Oberon's log {{reveals that}} the apes on board, led by Semos, {{organized}} a mutiny and {{took control of the}} vessel after it crashed. The human and ape survivors of the struggle left the ship and their descendants are the people Leo has encountered since landing. The apes arrive and attack the humans who have gathered to see Leo, although he is able to even the odds when he uses the Oberons last fragments of fuel to fire a final blast at the first wave of apes. The battle is halted as a familiar vehicle descends from the sky and is identified immediately by Leo. The pod is piloted by Pericles, the <b>chimp</b> astronaut. Pericles was pushed forward in time as Leo was, and had just now found his way to the planet. When Pericles lands and the pod opens, the apes interpret his arrival as the return of Semos, the first ape, who is their god. They bow, and hostilities between humans and apes suddenly cease.|$|E
50|$|A common {{chimpanzee}} {{from the}} Kasakela chimpanzee community {{was the first}} nonhuman animal reported making a tool, by modifying a twig to use as an instrument for extracting termites from their mound. At Taï, <b>chimps</b> simply use their hands to extract termites. When foraging for honey, <b>chimps</b> use modified short sticks to scoop the honey out of the hive, that is, if the bees are stingless. For hives of the dangerous African honeybees, <b>chimps</b> use longer and thinner sticks to extract the honey. <b>Chimps</b> also fish for ants using the same tactic.|$|R
50|$|Ant dipping is {{difficult}} and some <b>chimps</b> never master it. West African <b>chimps</b> crack open hard nuts with stones or branches. Some forethought in this activity is apparent, as these items are not found together or near a source of nuts. Nut cracking is also difficult and must be learned. <b>Chimps</b> also use leaves as sponges or spoons to drink water.|$|R
50|$|One study {{estimates}} that <b>chimps</b> live about 33 years for males, 37 years for females, in the wild, while some captured <b>chimps</b> have reached {{an age of}} 70 years and older.|$|R
5|$|The Powerpuff Girls Movie was {{released}} in the United States on July 3, 2002, by Warner Bros. and Cartoon Network. The movie, a prequel to the series, {{tells the story of}} how the Powerpuff Girls were created, and how Mojo Jojo became a supervillain. After Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup were created by Professor Utonium to help the city against crime, they end up only causing chaos in Townsville. Down about how everyone refers to them as freaks, they turn to Mojo Jojo, a monkey who says he is there to help make people like them again. Unknown to the girls, Mojo Jojo was Professor Utonium's lab <b>chimp</b> helper who was mutated as a cause from the Powerpuff Girls being made and has become super smart as a result and jealous of them. Mojo Jojo ends up tricking the girls into helping him make a machine to mutate other chimps. Seeing what they have done the kids run away in shame but come back after seeing Professor Utonium in trouble, and Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup end up beating Mojo Jojo and his army of mutated smart chimps and saving the day, thus becoming Townsville's new defenders. The movie received a rating of 63% at Rotten Tomatoes and received some criticism for the violence involved. In all, the movie grossed $16 million worldwide with an $11 million budget.|$|E
5|$|The {{next night}} is Krusty's {{farewell}} special, and as Krusty describes {{the history of}} his career, Bob straps Bart with explosives in order to kill Krusty. Bart attempts to hug Krusty, thereby setting off the explosives, but before he can, Krusty talks to the audience about how he regrets mistreating Sideshow Bob, holding himself responsible of turning Bob into a ruthless criminal. Krusty even goes far by singing a song on behalf of Bob, stating how very remorseful he is of mistreating him. Upon witnessing this, Bob is touched and develops a change of heart, but does {{not have time to}} stop his original plan from being carried out. Luckily, Krusty's trained <b>chimp</b> Mr. Teeny sees the life-threatening explosives, which he throws into the network executives' office, killing all the executives, though they would later reanimate themselves like the T-1000 from Terminator 2. Bart comes out of his hypnotic state and he and his family serve dinner with Krusty, Bob and Sideshow Mel in a restaurant. Although Krusty and Bob reconcile, police decide to execute Bob by guillotine for his plot of attempted murder, although he argues with Chief Wiggum that he should have a trial for it at least.|$|E

25|$|With the {{publication}} of the chimpanzee genome, plans to increase the use of <b>chimps</b> in labs are reportedly increasing, with some scientists arguing that the federal moratorium on breeding <b>chimps</b> for research should be lifted. A five-year moratorium was imposed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health in 1996, because too many <b>chimps</b> had been bred for HIV research, and it has been extended annually since 2001.|$|R
50|$|In {{the middle}} 1980s Spain had {{released}} legislation that forbade {{the use of}} chimpanzees as photographer's props, and this turn of action gave Cronin some optimism on how he would reach his goal of helping the <b>chimps.</b> In 1986 Cronin approached a British couple called Simon and Peggy Templer who had started rescuing the beach <b>chimps</b> in 1978. Cronin worked together with the Templers who {{had set up a}} half-way house where the confiscated <b>chimps</b> were being housed. The <b>chimps</b> {{would not be able to}} stay there for long, and it was Cronin's idea that shed light. Cronin requested discussions on how he could possibly help and with the assistance of the Spanish authorities (the Guardia Civil) confiscating the <b>chimps,</b> there would certainly be more individuals arriving at the small half-way house.|$|R

25|$|In March 2009, an {{attorney}} for Charla Nash's family filed a $50 million lawsuit against Sandra Herold. On May 6, a Stamford judge froze Herold's assets, valued at US$10 million. Other potential defendants included the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, the city of Stamford, and the veterinarian who prescribed the Xanax. The defense claimed the <b>chimp</b> had no violent behavior before the attack, and the two accusations in the 1990s attacks were untrue because the <b>chimp</b> had no teeth at the time.|$|E
25|$|When Detective <b>Chimp</b> {{finds the}} helmet will not fit him, he asks Captain Marvel {{to throw the}} helmet into space, {{allowing}} the helmet to find its new owner.

5000|$|Kasakela has had {{interactions}} with the Mitumba Chimpanzee Community as well. Some of these interactions have been hostile, and some Mitumba <b>chimps</b> {{are known to have}} been killed by Kasakela <b>chimps.</b> [...] At least two Kasakela females, Fifi's daughters Flossi and Flirt, have emigrated from Kasakela to join the Mitumba community. [...] Based on circumstantial evidence researchers believed that it is possible that Fifi herself may have {{died as a result of}} an attack by Mitumba <b>chimps.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the chimpanzees at Save the <b>Chimps</b> live in large social groups on three-acre islands located on 150 acres {{in a rural area}} of Fort Pierce, Florida. Save the <b>Chimps</b> is notable for rescuing 266 chimpanzees from the Coulston Foundation, a biomedical research facility that went bankrupt in 2002. The rescue of these chimpanzees was the single largest rescue of chimpanzees in history, and transformed Save the <b>Chimps</b> into the world's largest chimpanzee sanctuary.|$|R
2500|$|With the {{publication}} of the chimpanzee genome, there are reportedly plans to increase the use of <b>chimps</b> in labs, with scientists arguing that the federal moratorium on breeding <b>chimps</b> for research should be lifted. Other researchers argue that <b>chimps</b> are unique animals and should either not be used in research, or should be treated differently. Pascal Gagneux, an evolutionary biologist and primate expert at the University of California, San Diego, argues that, given chimpanzees' sense of self, tool use, and genetic similarity to human beings, studies using <b>chimps</b> should follow the ethical guidelines that are used for human subjects unable to give consent. Stuart Zola, director of the Yerkes National Primate Research Laboratory, disagrees. He told National Geographic: [...] "I don't think we should make a distinction between our obligation to treat humanely any species, whether it's a rat or a monkey or a chimpanzee. No matter how much we may wish it, <b>chimps</b> are not human." ...|$|R
25|$|The helmet later crosses paths {{again with}} Detective <b>Chimp,</b> Ibis the Invincible, Sargon the Sorcerer, Black Alice, and Zauriel {{before it reaches}} Doctor Kent V.

50|$|CHCI {{works to}} promote {{advocacy}} of chimpanzee conservation {{and the promotion}} of primate intellect. The sanctuary hosted public sessions, known as Chimposiums, which allowed the public to see the <b>chimps</b> in action. The sessions included a classroom section where the project was introduced and the visitors learned about the plight of chimpanzees in both captive and free-living situations, followed by a session observing and interacting with the <b>chimps.</b> For safety reasons, no one—visitors or staff—had physical contact with the <b>chimps.</b>|$|R

25|$|By {{this point}} Hamilton was well-honoured. However, {{by now he}} {{supported}} eugenics. He heard a story that HIV had been created from an accident with a polio vaccine, which it was thought could have been contaminated with a <b>chimp</b> virus. This supported his idea that modern medicine could be negative, as he thought medicine opposed {{the logic of the}} genes. So he travelled to eastern Congo to look for the virus, amid the murder and chaos. He died, and later research disproved the idea that HIV had come from a medical accident.|$|E
25|$|A 30-year {{study at}} Kyoto University's Primate Research Institute {{has shown that}} chimps are able to learn to {{recognise}} the numbers 1 through 9 and their values. The chimps further show an aptitude for photographic memory, demonstrated in experiments in which the jumbled digits are flashed onto a computer screen {{for less than a}} quarter of a second. One <b>chimp,</b> Ayumu, was able to correctly and quickly point to the positions where they appeared in ascending order. The same experiment was failed by human world memory champion Ben Pridmore on most attempts.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, {{researchers}} {{have demonstrated that}} chimpanzees (in captivity) use different [...] "words" [...] in reference to different foods.
