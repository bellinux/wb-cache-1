This model {{is based on}} the theoretical solution for the generating functional, and it is quite different and not more complicated than the Glauber-like approach used before. The model describes the structure function F 2 of the proton, as well as the diffractive structure function F D 2.

40|$|AbstractWe reconsider perturbative {{unitarity}} violation in {{the standard}} model Higgs inflation model. We show that the Cutkosky <b>cutting</b> <b>rule</b> implied by perturbative unitarity is fulfilled at one-loop. This is a strong indication that unitarity is restored order by order in perturbation theory. We then resum certain one-loop diagrams and show that the relevant dressed amplitude fulfills the Cutkosky rule exactly. This {{is an example of}} the self-healing mechanism. The original Higgs inflation model is thus consistent and does not require any new physics beyond the standard model at least up to the Planck scale...|$|E

30|$|This study {{proposed}} a more straightforward approach to optimizing tree selection: {{the criteria of}} the <b>cutting</b> <b>rule</b> were the tree’s stumpage value, its value increment, {{and the effect of}} removal on the growth of surrounding trees. It was assumed that increasing stumpage value, decreasing relative value increment and increasing competitive effect increase the likelihood of removal. Another hypothesis was that the optimal order of tree removal is less strongly correlated with tree diameter in irregular spatial distributions, as compared to regular tree arrangements. A third hypothesis was that, when net present value is maximized, it is optimal to remove trees at higher relative value increment than the discount rate that is used to calculate net present value.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} general {{framework}} {{for the evaluation of}} $d$-dimensional cut Feynman integrals based on the Baikov-Lee representation of purely-virtual Feynman integrals. We implement the generalized Cutkosky <b>cutting</b> <b>rule</b> using Cauchy's residue theorem and identify a set of constraints which determine the integration domain. The method applies equally well to Feynman integrals with a unitarity cut in a single kinematic channel and to maximally-cut Feynman integrals. Our cut Baikov-Lee representation reproduces the expected relation between cuts and discontinuities in a given kinematic channel and furthermore makes the dependence on the kinematic variables manifest from the beginning. By combining the Baikov-Lee representation of maximally-cut Feynman integrals and the properties of periods of algebraic curves, we are able to obtain complete solution sets for the homogeneous differential equations satisfied by Feynman integrals which go beyond multiple polylogarithms. We apply our formalism to the direct evaluation of a number of interesting cut Feynman integrals.

40|$|The Prism {{family of}} {{algorithms}} induces modular classification rules {{in contrast to}} the Top Down Induction of Decision Trees (TDIDT) approach which induces classification rules in the intermediate form of a tree structure. Both approaches achieve a comparable classification accuracy. However in some cases Prism outperforms TDIDT. For both approaches pre-pruning facilities have been developed in order to prevent the induced classifiers from overfitting on noisy datasets, by <b>cutting</b> <b>rule</b> terms or whole rules or by truncating decision trees according to certain metrics. There have been many pre-pruning mechanisms developed for the TDIDT approach, but for the Prism family the only existing pre-pruning facility is J-pruning. J-pruning not only works on Prism algorithms but also on TDIDT. Although {{it has been shown that}} J-pruning produces good results, this work points out that J-pruning does not use its full potential. The original J-pruning facility is examined and the use of a new pre-pruning facility, called Jmax-pruning, is proposed and evaluated empirically. A possible pre-pruning facility for TDIDT based on Jmax-pruning is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Short-pulse {{effects are}} {{investigated}} for the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process, i. e. {{the production of}} an electron-positron pair induced by a gamma photon inside an intense plane-wave laser pulse. To obtain the total pair-creation probability we verify (to leading-order) the <b>cutting</b> <b>rule</b> for the polarization operator {{in the realm of}} strong-field QED by an explicit calculation. Using a double-integral representation for the leading-order contribution to the polarization operator, compact expressions for the total pair-creation probability inside an arbitrary plane-wave background field are derived. Correspondingly, the photon wave function including leading-order radiative corrections in the laser field is obtained via the Schwinger-Dyson equation in the quasistatic approximation. Moreover, the influence of the carrier-envelope phase and of the laser pulse shape on the total pair-creation probability in a linearly polarized laser pulse is investigated, and the validity of the (local) constant-crossed field approximation analyzed. It is shown that with presently available technology pair-creation probabilities of the order of ten percent could be reached for a single gamma photon. Comment: 19 pages, 14 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{relationship}} between the Optical Theorem and the <b>cutting</b> <b>rules.</b> Through carefully analytic calculations we find that they conflict with each other. In fact, according to the <b>cutting</b> <b>rules</b> the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude isn't proportional to the total cross section for production of all final states. This conclusion doesn't conflict with the unitarity of S-matrix, since in some specific circumstances radiative corrections may bring anomaly and break some symmetries of quantum field theory. On the other hand, the Breit-Wigner formula for unstable particles can be explained well as before...|$|R
