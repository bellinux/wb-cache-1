5|$|As {{the convoy}} of landing craft and other vessels ferried the Commandos across the English Channel; however, {{they had a}} chance {{encounter}} with a German tanker escorted by a number of armed trawlers which proceeded to fire upon them. In the <b>confusion</b> <b>that</b> followed a number of the landing craft were damaged and forced to turn back, while others were reported as missing and believed sunk. As a result {{the decision was made to}} abandon the attack.|$|E
5|$|Christian Renoux, {{a history}} {{professor}} at the University of Orléans, published in French in 2001 a book-length study of the prayer and its origins, clearing up much of the <b>confusion</b> <b>that</b> had accumulated previously. The Franciscan journal Frate Francesco and the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano published articles in Italian summarizing the book's findings, and Renoux published an online abstract in English at The Franciscan Archive.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, the Philippine Senate {{passed a}} bill declaring waling-waling (Vanda sanderiana) as the {{national}} flower alongside Sampaguita. A similar bill in the House of Representatives had already been passed in 2012. Normally, the bill would become law after being signed by the President. However, it was vetoed by President Benigno Aquino III. The veto did not grant the waling-waling as the second national flower due to the <b>confusion</b> <b>that</b> it would create.|$|E

5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid <b>confusion,</b> <b>that</b> such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin {{had been unable to}} explain what happened at a Home seance, and critics claimed that Home had refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin. There is, however, not a shred of evidence for either of these claims.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hans-Joachim Marseille, {{who was a}} {{marksman}} {{and expert}} {{in the art of}} deflection shooting, Hartmann was a master of stalk-and-ambush tactics. By his own account, he was convinced that 80% of the pilots he downed did not even realise what hit them. He relied on the powerful engine of his Bf109 for high-power sweeps and quick approaches, occasionally diving through entire enemy formations {{to take advantage of the}} <b>confusion</b> <b>that</b> followed in order to disengage.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of <b>confusion</b> <b>that</b> Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E

5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray {{is closely}} related to H. undulata and H. leoparda, which share much of its range. All three species are very similar in size, shape, and color pattern, resulting in a long history of taxonomic <b>confusion</b> <b>that</b> only recently is starting to be untangled. In 2004, Mabel Manjaji described the 'uarnak' species complex, containing H. fai, H. gerrardi, H. jenkinsii, H. leoparda, H. toshi, H. uarnak, and H. undulata, plus three more undescribed species. The reticulate whipray itself varies in appearance throughout its range, and further taxonomic comparisons are required to determine whether its spotted and reticulated color morphs in fact represent different species. Alternate common names for this ray include coachwhip ray, leopard stingray, longtail stingray, and marbled stingray; some of these names are shared by other, similar species.|$|E
5|$|A popular lakon named Irawan Rabi ("Irawan's wedding") {{tells about}} {{the love of}} Irawan and Titisari, a {{daughter}} of Kresna (Krishna). While Titisari is engaged to Irawan, Baladewa (Baladeva), Kresna's brother and an ally of the Kurawas (Kauravas), wants her to marry Lesmana Mandrakumara, the son of Durjudana (Duryodhana), initiating a dramatic conflict. The conflict that ensues ends up being three-sided, among the Pandawas, Kurawas and the ogre-kingdom, whose evil ogre-king Barandjana plans to kidnap Titisari. The <b>confusion</b> <b>that</b> follows results in the outwitting and humiliation of the Kurawas. Siti Sendari, the eldest daughter of Kresna and the estranged wife of Abhimanju, {{takes advantage of the}} situation and schemes to bring Irawan and Titisari together, while also mending her relationships with her husband. Though officially Irawan and Titisari are the hero and heroine of the lakon, in reality they are mere spectators, not the movers, in the play. Brandon describes Irawan as a minor character. Irawan is also depicted as unassertive and manipulated by others, which is common in South Asian theatre. Another lakon called Serat Lampahan Pregiwa Pregiwati also relates a tale about the love of Irawan and Titisari.|$|E
5|$|In 1593 and 1594, {{when the}} theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare {{published}} two narrative poems on sexual themes, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in The Rape of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin. Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses, the poems show the guilt and moral <b>confusion</b> <b>that</b> result from uncontrolled lust. Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, {{in which a}} young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in {{the first edition of}} the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects. The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission.|$|E

25|$|While {{the use of}} paracetamol, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, {{and other}} NSAIDS {{concurrently}} with weak to mid-range opiates (up to about the hydrocodone level) has been said to show beneficial synergistic effects by combatting pain at multiple sites of action, several combination analgesic products {{have been shown to}} have few efficacy benefits when compared to similar doses of their individual components. Moreover, these combination analgesics can often result in significant adverse events, including accidental overdoses, most often due to <b>confusion</b> <b>that</b> arises from the multiple (and often non-acting) components of these combinations.|$|E
