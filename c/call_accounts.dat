40|$|Historically, {{debates about}} the nature of proper names have been about whether we should treat them as devices of {{reference}} or as disguised definite descriptions. More recently, however, the debate centers around treating them as devices of reference or as predicates. There are different views {{about the nature of}} name-predicates. At least one version of predicativism relies on analyzing name-predicates as involving the concept of being called by a name – <b>calling</b> <b>accounts.</b> Some have offered meta-linguistic <b>calling</b> <b>accounts</b> of the nature of such predicates, but such accounts are subject to criticism on the grounds of failing to be informative. An alternative <b>calling</b> <b>account,</b> the attributive account, most fully developed by Fara, does not fall prey to this objection, on the face of it. However, {{it is not clear that}} it is informative in any substantive sense. It also rests on a mistaken conception of the nature of meta-linguistic actions that itself suggests another way to understand proper names...|$|R
