In the 2002 - 03 federal budget, the government aimed to introduce an increase of close to 28 per cent in PBS copayments and safety net thresholds; this paper examines {{the impact on the}} costs to government and patients and estimates the distributional effects of this policy change, particularly for older Australians. Finding ways of <b>curbing</b> government <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> the PBS while maintaining social equity and access to 2 ̆ 7 essential 2 ̆ 7 medicines is at the centre of ongoing public debate. The PBS is highly progressive, with 80 per cent of total PBS government outlays being directed at concessional patients, the majority of whom are elderly. Older Australians receive far greater PBS benefits than any other user group: an estimated 16 per cent of total PBS government outlays are directed towards persons aged 75 years and over. In the 2002 - 03 federal budget, the government aimed to introduce an increase of close to 28 per cent in PBS copayments and safety net thresholds. Using PharmaSim, a microsimulation model of the PBS, Laurie Brown, Annie Abello, Ben Phillips and Ann Harding examine the impact on the costs to government and patients of PBS listed medicines and estimates the distributional effects of this policy change, particularly for older Australians...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} an overview of funding mechanisms in Croatian health care and analyses them in terms of sustainability, efficiency and equity. The study presents an in depth investigation of problems facing funding health care in Croatia: high expenditure, inadequate financial resources, continuous deficits of the state insurance fund, lack of transparency in funding, an aging population, etc. Furthermore, the {{study provides}} a critical overview of reforms that have been implemented to counter those issues from 1990 to 2002. The study argues that the implemented reforms over relied <b>on</b> shifting health <b>expenditure</b> from public to private sources in addressing financial deficits in the system. The study argues that, instead, the reforms should have focused more <b>on</b> <b>curbing</b> rising <b>expenditure</b> in health care providers. Emphasis has been put {{on the extent to which}} the reforms affected the conceptual-social foundations of the system. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for policy makers in Croatia and presents an overview of Croatian experiences that might be of interest to researchers and policy makers internationally...|$|R

[...] "In a country that calls itself a democracy it really is a scandal that an unelected revising chamber should be tolerated, in which the Conservative Party has a permanent and overwhelming majority" [...] Wilkinson attacks the House of Lords, in a magazine article of August 1930 [...] With Wilkinson's assistance, the Mental Treatment Act 1930 received the Royal Assent on 30 June 1930. In the same year she co-sponsored a bill to limit shopworkers' hours to 48 a week, and poured scorn on Conservatives opposing the measure who seemed, she said, to think that all shop work was carried out in the [...] "soothing atmosphere" [...] and [...] "exquisite scents" [...] of Jermyn Street and Bond Street. The bill was referred to a parliamentary committee, but got no further. As the parliament progressed, it became increasingly difficult to promote social legislation in the face of the mounting financial crisis and the use by the Conservative-dominated House of Lords of its statutory delaying powers.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to analyze the major effects of public {{military}} forces <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> Colombia economic growth during 1970 - 2003 span period.

It was found empirical evidence documenting {{that there is no}} positive and systematic relation between economic growth and the allocation of military expenditure. The authors draw the conclusion, specifically for Colombia, that allocation of defense and security resources put a <b>curb</b> <b>on</b> economic growth and explain increased (PFE) results in a negative effect <b>on</b> social <b>expenditure.</b> Growth...|$|R
