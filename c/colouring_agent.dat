2500|$|Saffron (pronounced [...] or [...] ) is a spice {{derived from}} the flower of Crocus sativus, {{commonly}} known as the [...] "saffron crocus". [...] The vivid crimson stigmas and styles, called threads, are collected and dried to be used mainly as a seasoning and <b>colouring</b> <b>agent</b> in food. Saffron, long among the world's most costly spices by weight, was probably first cultivated in or near Greece. C.sativus is probably a form of C.cartwrightianus, that emerged by human cultivators selectively breeding plants for unusually long stigmas in late Bronze Age Crete. It slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia and was later brought to parts of North Africa, North America, and Oceania.|$|E
40|$|The paprika oleoresin, {{that is an}} oil soluble {{extract from}} the fruits of Capsicum Annum Linn or Capsicum Frutescens, is used often to raise the <b>colour</b> <b>agent</b> content of paprika powders. We {{investigated}} how the <b>colour</b> <b>agent</b> content of paprika powder samples with added oleoresin change {{in the course of}} storage. The <b>colour</b> <b>agent</b> content of 7 different quality powders was increased with 7 - 75 % using two types of oleoresin. The initial <b>colour</b> <b>agent</b> content of the samples changed between 41 and 169 ASTA units. The powders were made from Chinese, Peruvian and Hungarian paprika. The <b>colour</b> <b>agent</b> content of the samples was measured throughout 10 months. The measured values were analysed using ANOVA. The decrease of <b>colour</b> <b>agent</b> content varied between 22 and 51 percent, while the average reduction was 33 percent.

2500|$|Resorcinol {{crystallizes}} from benzene as colorless needles {{that are}} readily soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, but insoluble in chloroform and carbon disulfide. It reduces Fehling's solution and ammoniacal silver solutions. It does not form a precipitate with lead acetate solution, {{as does the}} isomeric pyrocatechol. Iron(III) chloride colors its aqueous solution a dark-violet, and bromine water precipitates tribromoresorcin. These properties are what give it its use as a <b>colouring</b> <b>agent</b> for certain chromatography experiments. Sodium amalgam reduces it to dihydroresorcin, which when heated to 150 to 160°C with concentrated barium hydroxide solution gives γ-acetylbutyric acid (D. Vorlgnder); when fused with potassium hydroxide, resorcinol yields phloroglucin, pyrocatechol, and diresorcin. It condenses with acids or acid chlorides, {{in the presence of}} dehydrating agents, to oxyketones, e.g., with zinc chloride and glacial acetic acid at 145°C it yields resacetophenone (HO)2C6H3~CO.CH3. With the anhydrides of dibasic acids, it yields fluoresceins. When heated with calcium chloride—ammonia to 200°C it yields meta-dioxydiphenylamine. With sodium nitrite it forms a water-soluble blue dye, which is turned red by acids, and is used as an indicator, under the name of lacmoid. [...] It condenses readily with aldehydes, yielding with formaldehyde, on the addition of catalytic hydrochloric acid, methylene diresorcin 2•CH2. Reaction with chloral hydrate in the presence of potassium bisulfate yields the lactone of tetra-oxydiphenyl methane carboxylic acid. In alcoholic solution it condenses with sodium acetoacetate to form 4-methylumbelliferone.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMicrosamples of pink {{cosmetic}} powders {{from the}} Greco-Roman period {{were analyzed using}} two complementary analytical approaches for identification of the <b>colouring</b> <b>agents</b> (lake pigments originally manufactured from madder plants with an inert binder, usually a metallic salt) present in the samples. The first technique was a methanolic acidic extraction of the archaeological samples with an additional ethyl acetate extraction of the anthraquinone-type <b>colouring</b> <b>agents</b> which were identified using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization with high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-HRMS), and the second was direct analysis of a microsample by laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (LDI-MS). The latter technique is well suited when the quantity of samples is very low. This soft ionization technique enables the detection of very small quantities of compounds using the combination of positive and negative-ion modes. It was also successfully applied for the direct analysis of some laboratory-made reference compounds. However, the presence of lead {{in one of these}} ancient samples induced a spectral suppression phenomenon. In this case and conditional on a sufficient quantity of available sample, the former method is better adapted for the characterization of these anthraquinone-type molecules. This study also confirmed that purpurin, munjistin, and pseudopurpurin are the principal <b>colouring</b> <b>agents</b> present in these ancient cosmetic powders constituted from madder plants...|$|R
