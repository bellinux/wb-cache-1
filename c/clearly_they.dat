5|$|Family members {{contribute}} to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack {{the capacity to}} acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more <b>clearly.</b> <b>They</b> often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their older siblings. There are limitations to studies {{that focus on the}} influences of fathers and siblings, as most research is descriptive and correlational. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does. The majority of research in this field is conducted with mother/child pairs.|$|E
5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change {{that is going to be}} made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more <b>clearly.</b> <b>They</b> will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.|$|E
25|$|A {{hearing aid}} or deaf aid is an electroacoustic device which is {{designed}} to amplify sound for the wearer, usually with the aim of making speech more intelligible, and to correct impaired hearing as measured by audiometry. This type of assistive technology helps people with hearing loss participate more fully in their communities by allowing them to hear more <b>clearly.</b> <b>They</b> amplify any and all sound waves through use of a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. There is a wide variety of hearing aids available, including digital, in-the-ear, in-the-canal, behind-the-ear, and on-the-body aids.|$|E

25|$|An {{option for}} the more adventurous was to find an {{appointment}} abroad. Tsarist Russia {{proved to be a}} relatively well-paid option for many. According to Harvey Pitcher in When Miss Emmie was in Russia: English Governesses before, during and after the October Revolution, as many as thousands of English-speaking governesses went there. As English became the fashionable language of choice among the aristocracy during the later days of the regime, <b>clearly</b> <b>they</b> were displacing opportunities formerly spread more across the French-speaking world. The estimate of numbers ('thousands'), although necessarily vague, is justified by some knowledge of the main lodging house used by those not accommodated with their host families, St. Andrew's House, Moscow, and by the places of worship they preferentially frequented, for example the church associated with the House. Pitcher drew extensively on the archives of the Governesses' Benevolent Institution in London; there is also some allusion to the phenomenon of governesses being engaged abroad in A galaxy of governesses by Bea Howe.|$|E

2500|$|Initial successes with Whiteman were {{followed}} by disaster when they reached New York {{and for a while}} Whiteman must have thought of letting them go. Possibly Bing might have been retained as Whiteman was already using him as a solo performer on record, but the prospects for Rinker must have been bleak. However, the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter Harry Barris made all the difference to the act and [...] "The Rhythm Boys" [...] were born. The additional voice meant that the boys could be heard more easily in the large New York theaters and they quickly became a real success. A year touring with Whiteman performing and recording with musicians Bix Beiderbecke, Jack Teagarden, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Eddie Lang and Hoagy Carmichael, provided valuable experience and then they were sent out on tour alone. Much {{has been written about the}} escapades of the three men during this period and <b>clearly</b> <b>they</b> were living life to the full. Despite all of this, Bing was continuing to develop and when the Rhythm Boys rejoined the Whiteman troupe in 1929, he had matured considerably as a performer. He was constantly in demand as a solo artist on record and radio.|$|E

40|$|A common {{recommendation}} for communication partners {{of people with}} hearing loss is to speak clearly, but how effective is this simple instruction? Does everyone produce clear speech using the same strategies? Is clear speech produced when given minimal instruction {{the same as that}} produced when competing background noise is present? The present study examined the acoustic characteristics of passage level speech produced in four different conditions. Twelve talkers (8 female, 4 male) {{with a mean age of}} 21 years were audio recorded reading three paragraph length passages. In the first condition talkers read each passage conversationally as though speaking to a friend. In the three experimental conditions, talkers were instructed to speak as <b>clearly</b> as <b>they</b> could, speak as <b>clearly</b> as <b>they</b> could in the presence of multitalker babble, and speak as <b>clearly</b> as <b>they</b> could in the presence of speech-shaped noise. The babble and noise were presented over headphones at a level of 75 dB SPL. Acoustic measures examined changes in rate, frequency, and intensity across condition. Results of this study help clarify what changes talkers make in response to instructions to speak clearly compared to conditions with competing background noise...|$|R
