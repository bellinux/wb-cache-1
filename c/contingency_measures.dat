40|$|Project {{background}} The draft South East Queensland (SEQ) Regional Water Supply Strategy {{identified the}} need for a SEQ water grid that will allow water to be transferred from areas with surplus to those in need. The grid includes the construction and operation of the Northern Pipeline Interconnector (NPI). The NPI is a drought <b>contingency</b> <b>measure,</b> set down in the Water Regulation 2002, as amended under the Water Amendment Regulation (No. 6) 2006, which will link existing bulk water supplies on the Sunshine Coast to the greater Brisbane area. The Project Under the Water Regulation 2002, the NPI is a drought <b>contingency</b> <b>measure</b> that will supply a target 65 mega litres per day (ML/d) of potable water from the Sunshine Coast to Brisbane and the SEQ water grid. Given the complexity of the NPI, it will be constructed in two stages, with Stage 2 completed by 31 May 2009. The project {{that is the subject of}} the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for which these Terms of Reference (ToR) relate is only for the Stage 2 component of the NPI, a water pipeline and associated ancillary infrastructure (e. g. pumping stations) between the Landers Shute Water Treatment Plant (WTP) and the Landers Shute water main to the existing Noosa WTP (“the Project”). The proposed pipeline route will traverse both private and public lands. The land use traversed by the route includes rural (agriculture, forestry), rural and urban residential, commercial, conservation and forest reserves and national parks. A range of route options have been examined and these are discussed in an Initial Advice Statement (IAS) for Stage 2 which accompany these ToR. The IAS can also be viewed at...|$|R

30|$|Among the {{research}} questions were: to what extent have NPC achieve its objectives {{and what are the}} problems faced by the teachers during the implementation of NPC. Findings of this study provide indirect measure of the effectiveness of monitoring system for the implementation of NPC. This research adopted the Stake’s Congruence Contingency Model for Educational Evaluation. Three categories of data were collected, these are antecedent (situation before which will affect the implementation of curriculum), transaction (process of implementation) and product (of implementation of the curriculum). For each of this category, data collected are related to the aspiration, observation of actual implementation/ test result, standards set by expert and evaluation by stake holders. The concept of congruence (between aspired and actual implementation) and <b>contingency</b> (<b>measure</b> of dependency) is used. Data was collected through questionnaire, classroom observation, and interview (MOE 2008, CDD 2007 a). A total of 3624 (61.6 %) preschool teachers returned the questionnaires. A total of 28 classroom observations and interviews were conducted in various states.|$|R
50|$|Under the proposal, Pappas would {{acquire the}} {{programming}} inventories of both KAUT and KGMC (including {{the rights to}} the Fox affiliation held by channel 43) and transfer them to channel 25. As a consequence, Heritage would donate the KAUT license to OETA for $1 million, with Pappas entering into a 25-year lease to allow OETA to operate the KAUT transmitter facility for $1 per year. Seraphim, meanwhile, would convert KGMC into a primary affiliate of the Home Shopping Network (HSN) - which was already carried overnights on channel 34 through HSN's Home Shopping Spree service - and acquire some religious programs to fill portions of its schedule that would not be occupied by HSN programming. OETA planned to help fund the conversion of channel 43 through start-up grants, including a $75,000 grant awarded by management from ABC affiliate KOCO-TV (channel 5).
