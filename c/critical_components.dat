Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are <b>critical</b> <b>components</b> of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin {{is found in}} hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also play structural functions, for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of steel. From that time on, vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other <b>critical</b> <b>components.</b> There are two groups of vanadium steel alloys. Vanadium high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E

40|$|In some {{electronic}} {{products and}} sculpture crafts, there are possibly vulnerable elements {{that can be}} idealized as cantilever beam type, failure of which will certainly lead the whole product to lose function. Based on the <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> of cantilever beam type, a nonlinear coupling dynamics model between the <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> and the item was established. The computing procedure of the model was designed using finite difference scheme. A numerical example shows that the acceleration changes notably with {{the length of the}} <b>critical</b> <b>component,</b> and the cantilevered end of the <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> is liable to be damaged, because the dynamic stress there is the largest. In this case, the maximum acceleration just cannot serve as the damaged criterion of the packaged goods, only with the maximum stress value. In order to avoid making a mistake, it is necessary to consider the <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> as an elastic element. The maximum stress of the cantilever beam surpasses the proportional limit of elastic components or is not an effective structural strength to determine whether the product loses its functions...|$|R

25|$|A static {{discharge}} {{in the presence}} of air or oxygen can create ozone. Ozone can degrade rubber parts. Many elastomers are sensitive to ozone cracking.

Preventive measures include adding anti-ozonants to the rubber mix, or using an ozone-resistant elastomer.

25|$|Therefore, a possibility, first {{suggested}} by Francis Crick, {{is that the}} first life was based on RNA, which has the DNA-like properties of information storage and the catalytic properties of some proteins. This is called the RNA world hypothesis, and it is supported by the observation that many of the most <b>critical</b> <b>components</b> of cells (those that evolve the slowest) are composed mostly or entirely of RNA. Also, many critical cofactors (ATP, Acetyl-CoA, NADH, etc.) are either nucleotides or substances clearly related to them.

2500|$|The Notch pathway is {{essential}} for maintaining NPCs in the developing brain. Activation of the pathway is sufficient to maintain NPCs in a proliferating state, whereas loss-of-function mutations in the <b>critical</b> <b>components</b> of the pathway cause precocious neuronal differentiation and NPC depletion. Modulators of the Notch signal, e.g., the Numb protein are able to antagonize Notch effects, resulting in the halting of cell cycle and differentiation of NPCs. Conversely, the Fibroblast Growth Factor pathway promotes Notch signaling to keep stem cells of the cerebral cortex in the proliferative state, amounting to a mechanism regulating cortical surface area growth and, potentially, gyrification. [...] In this way, Notch signaling controls NPC self-renewal as well as cell fate specification.|$|E
