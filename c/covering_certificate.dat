40|$|This study investigates how {{community}} characteristics {{influenced the}} timing of marriage {{of men and women}} in nineteenth and early twentieth century Netherlands on the basis of a large scale database consisting of marriage <b>certificates</b> <b>covering</b> five provinces of the Netherlands between 1840 and 1922. The results show the significance of religious context for understanding marriage timing in the nineteenth century. Living in a predominantly Catholic community resulted in a later marriage for both men and women, while living in a community that was dominated by Orthodox Protestants resulted in an earlier marriage, particularly for men. In addition, residence in a municipality with a high mobility, a large population size and a high birth rate speeded up marriage timing among both men and women. The results indicate that religious restraint and the urbanization and openness of places are, next to parental social class, of vast importance for understanding marriage timing. As our study only addressed those who married, future research will have to show whether the same mechanisms were at work for those that experienced permanent celibacy. © 2010 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

In 1828 MacGregor began to sell certificates entitling the holders to [...] "land in Poyais Proper" [...] at five shillings per acre. Two years later King Robert Charles Frederic, who had succeeded his brother George Frederic Augustus in 1824, issued thousands of <b>certificates</b> <b>covering</b> the same territory and offered them to lumber companies in London, directly competing with MacGregor. When the original investors demanded their long-overdue interest, MacGregor could only pay with more certificates. Other charlatans soon caught on {{and set up}} their own rival [...] "Poyaisian offices" [...] in London, offering land debentures in competition with both MacGregor and the Mosquito king. By 1834 MacGregor was back in Scotland and living in Edinburgh. He paid some unredeemed securities by issuing yet another series of Poyaisian land certificates. Two years later he published a constitution for a smaller Poyaisian republic, centred on the region surrounding the Black River, and headed by himself as President. It was clear, however, that [...] "Poyais had had its day," [...] as Sinclair puts it. An attempt by MacGregor to sell some land certificates in 1837 marks the last record of any Poyais scheme.|$|R
40|$|Evaluations {{of changes}} to the Medicaid program have focused on {{increases}} in the generosity of income cutoffs for Medicaid eligibility. Previous research shows that despite dramatic increases {{in the number of}} births paid for by the Medicaid program, women often enroll in Medicaid at the point of birth rather than before. States have addressed this problem by adopting administrative measures designed to simplify the Medicaid application process and encourage the use of prenatal care. At the same time, recent declines in welfare caseloads may effectively increasing administrative barriers to obtaining care. We examine the effects of these three types of policies (changes in income eligibility, administrative reforms, and changes in welfare caseloads) on the use of prenatal care and infant health using data from birth <b>certificates</b> <b>covering</b> all U. S. births between 1990 and 1996. We find that increases in income cutoffs increased the use of prenatal care, while decreases in welfare caseloads reduced the use of prenatal care, especially among blacks. The administrative reforms we consider had little effect. The changes in the utilization of prenatal care that were induced by increases in income eligibility cutoffs and decreases in welfare rates led to small but statistically significant reductions in the incidence of very low birthweight among whites. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the most {{frequent}} non-conformities identified in different European countries in the processes of forest management certification according to FSC standards. A total of 31 active certificates from five countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia, Romania, Slovenia and the United Kingdom) were analysed, including all active certificates (as of 1 st of June 2014) from three countries along with a sample of 13 FSC certificates issued in the UK and one <b>certificate</b> <b>covering</b> 95 % of the certified forest area in Slovenia. 253 non-conformities in relation to FSC standard requirements were identified as formulated by the audit teams and the most frequently identified non-conformities in the certification process were those related to Principle 6 - Environmental impact (34 %), Principle 4 - Community relations and workerâ€™s rights (17 %) and Principle 8 - Monitoring and Assessment (13 %). A slight positive correlation was noticed between the FSC certified area and the total number of non-conformities, with a closer link in the case of Principle 9 - Maintenance of high conservation value forests, and Principle 4. The non-conformities related to Principles 4, 6 and 9 appeared to be significantly influenced in occurrence by country development; less often in the UK compared with the other four countries...|$|R
40|$|Evaluations {{of changes}} to the Medicaid program have focused on {{increases}} in the generosity of income cutoffs for eligibility. Previous research shows that despite dramatic increases {{in the number of}} births paid for by Medicaid, many eligible women are still getting inadequate prenatal care. States have addressed this problem by adopting administrative measures designed to simplify the Medicaid application process and encourage the use of prenatal care. At the same time, recent declines in welfare caseloads may have caused many women to lose their Medicaid coverage by effectively increasing administrative barriers to obtaining care. We examine the effects of changes in income eligibility, administrative reforms, and welfare caseloads on the use of prenatal care and infant health using data from birth <b>certificates</b> <b>covering</b> all U.

We find that increases in income cutoffs were associated with increased use of prenatal care among whites, while decreases in welfare caseloads were associated with reduced use of prenatal care, especially among blacks. Reduced form estimates suggest that changes in income cutoffs were associated with a reduced probability of fetal death among blacks and disadvantaged whites. None of the administrative reforms we consider had consistently positive effects. These results suggest that the administrative reforms undertaken to date have been insufficient to break the close link between participation in welfare and access to prenatal care under the Medicaid program...|$|R
40|$|Persons {{engaged in}} the {{business}} of rendering service are consumers, not retailers, of the tangible personal property which they use incidentally in rendering the service. Tax, accordingly, applies to the sale of the property to them. If in addition to rendering service they regularly sell tangible personal property to consumers, they are retailers with respect to such sales and they must obtain permits, file returns and remit tax measured by such sales. If their purchases of tangible personal property are predominantly for consumption rather than for resale, they should not give resale <b>certificates</b> <b>covering</b> such purchases but should follow the procedure prescribed in the regulation governing “Tax-Paid Purchases Resold. ” The basic distinction in determining whether a particular transaction involves a sale of tangible personal property or the transfer of tangible personal property incidental to the performance of a service is one of the true object of the contract; that is, is the real object sought by the buyer the service per se or the property produced by the service. If the true object of the contract is the service per se, the transaction is not subject to tax even though some tangible personal property is transferred. For example, a firm which performs business advisory, record keeping, payroll and tax services for small businesses and furnishes forms, binders, and other property to its clients as an incident to the rendition of its services is the consumer and not the retailer of such tangible personal property. The true object of the contract between the firm and its client is the performance of a service and not the furnishing of tangibl...|$|R
50|$|The largest grant under a Certificate of Claim was of over 2.7 million acres, {{amounting to}} {{almost all of}} {{what was then the}} North Nyasa District (covering all of today’s Karonga, Chitipa and Rumphi districts). The African Lakes Company claimed to have made {{treaties}} with local chiefs, but a report in 1929 questioned the validity of the claims, and investigation showed that they were spurious. Some supposed treaties had never been made at all, others with people who were not chiefs at all, or not of the areas claimed, and some were obtained by deception. The African Lakes Company made almost no effort to develop its land and had not imposed any obligations on the local Africans to work for it or to pay rent. The company had however sold off some of the land it claimed to plantations which did impose these obligations, and local people were concerned that there would be further sales. By the time of this report, the African Lakes Company had been taken over by the British South Africa Company, which agreed in 1930 to the cancellation of the Certificate of Claim in exchange for the grant of mineral rights over the same area. The African Lakes Company also received seven other <b>certificates</b> <b>covering</b> almost 45,000 acres. Three were for small bases at ports by the Shire or Lake Nyasa, the others were for moderately-sized estates in the Shire Highlands. However, African Lakes failed to substantiate two other claims. The first was a large claim in the South Nyasa District, now Mangochi District comprising all the land south of Lake Nyasa and west of the Shire, which was said to have been purchased for £5. The other was in Mlanje District, where the company tried to occupy land without any semblance of buying it. The company was also awarded mineral rights in five areas.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{completeness}} of data on death certificates over the past 25 years in Beirut, Lebanon, and to examine factors associated with the absence of certifiers' signatures and the non-reporting of the underlying cause of death. METHODS: A systematic 20 % sample comprising 2607 death <b>certificates</b> <b>covering</b> the 1974, 1984, 1994, 1997 and 1998 registration periods was retrospectively reviewed for certification practices and missing data. FINDINGS: The information on the death certificates was almost complete in respect of all {{demographic characteristics of the}} deceased persons except for occupation and month of birth. Data relating to these variables were missing on approximately 95 % and 78 % of the certificates, respectively. Around half of the certificates did not carry a certifier's signature. Of those bearing such a signature, 21. 6 % lacked documentation of the underlying cause of death. The certifier's signature was more likely to be absent on: certificates corresponding to the younger and older age groups than on those of persons aged 15 - 44 years; those of females than on those of males; those of persons who had been living remotely from the registration governorate than on those of other deceased persons; and those for which there had been delays in registration exceeding six months than on certificates for which registration had been quicker. For certificates that carried the certifier's signature {{there was no evidence that}} any of the demographic characteristics of the deceased person was associated with decreased likelihood of reporting an underlying cause of death. CONCLUSION: The responsibility for failure to report causes of death in Beirut lies with families who lack an incentive to call for a physician and with certifying physicians who do not carry out this duty. The deficiencies in death certification are rectifiable. However, any changes should be sensitive to the constraints of the organizational and legal infrastructure governing death registration practices and the medical educational systems in the country...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE The limited {{scientific}} knowledge on relationship between exposure and health effects {{in relation to}} geothermal activity motivated an epidemiologic investigation in Tuscan geothermal area. The study aims to describe the health status of populations living in Tuscany municipalities where concessions for exploitation of geothermal resources were granted. DESIGN This is an ecological study, {{so it is not}} useful to produce evidence to sustain a judgment on the cause-effect link. The major limits of this type of study are the use of the residence at municipal level as a proxy of exposure to both environmental and socioeconomic factors and the use of aggregated data of health outcomes that can lead to the well-known ecological fallacy. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Sixteen municipalities were included in the study area: eight are part of the so-called “traditional” geothermal area, defined as Northern Geothermal Area (NGA) and eight located in the Amiata Mountain defined as Southern Geothermal Area (SGA). In 2000 - 2006, the average resident population in the overall area was approximately 43, 000 inhabitants. Thirty one geothermal power plants were active, with a production capacity of 811 MW, 5 of them with 88 MW located in the SGA. Statistical analyses on the entire geothermal area, NGA and SGA subareas, and the sixteen municipalities were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES MORTALITY DATA were obtained from Tuscany Regional Mortality Registry for the 1971 - 2006 period, analysing 60 causes of death, of interest for population health status or consistent with “Project SENTIERI” criteria. HOSPITAL DISCHARGE RECORDS of residents in Tuscany Region in 2004 - 2006, anywhere admitted to hospital, were analyzed considering only the main diagnosis, excluding repeated admissions for the same cause. The causes taken into account are the same analysed for mortality were considered. Age-standardized mortality rates (TSDM) and the temporal trends of TSDM for four periods (1971 - 1979, 1980 - 1989, 1990 - 1999, 2000 - 2006) were computed. Age-standardized mortality/hospitalization ratios (SMR/SHR), with and without adjustment for the deprivation index based on 2001 census data, were calculated: mortality in the years 2000 - 2006 and hospitalization in 2004 - 2006. The expected number of events were computed using rates of residents in neighbouring municipalities (municipalities included in 50 km radius circle centred on the study area). Bayesian estimates of mortality/hospitalization ratios (BMR/BHR) at municipal level only and relating maps of the Bayesian risk estimators were elaborated. CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS (MC) were analysed using data from Tuscan Registry of Birth Defect in 1992 - 2006 period, relative to outcomes of pregnancies in women resident in the municipalities of study area, wherever the birth or termination of pregnancy occurred. The ratio between observed and expected cases (O/A), with expected defined according to regional rate, were calculated and O/A Bayesian estimates (BMR) are showed only at municipal level. The low weight and the males/females ratio at birth were analysed using data from Tuscany Birth <b>Certificates,</b> <b>covering</b> period 2001 - 2007, excluding biths occurred in facilities outside Tuscany Region. For Low birth weight (64 years). Among females resident in SGA a mortality excess from digestive system diseases was observed (72 observed, 55 expected). The hospitalization in the overall Geothermal Area did not show any excess for all causes and all tumours in both genders. Statistically significant excesses for hospital admission from stomach cancer among males (49 observed, 38 expected) and females (42 observed, 28 expected), and from lymphohematopoietic tumours among females, particularly from lymphatic leukaemia (15 observed, 5 expected), were observed. As mortality analysis highlighted, also hospital admissions by geothermal areas and gender showed a worst picture in SGA than in NGA. In the latter, a significant excess of hospital admissions from all causes among females (1, 357 observed, 1, 284 expected) but not among males (1, 193 observed, 1, 141 expected) and an excess - close to statistical significance - from all tumours only among females (297 observed; 272 expected) were observed. Furthermore, statistically significant excesses of hospital admissions from digestive system diseases in both genders (M: 392 observed, 350 expected; F: 300 observed, 268 expected), from dementias (16 observed, 8 expected) and from lymphhematopoietic cancers among females, particularly from lymphatic leukaemia (9 observed, 2 expected), were observed. In the SGA, statistically significant excesses of hospital admissions for stomach cancer (M: 32 observed, 21 expected, not significant after adjusting by DI; F: 29 observed, 18 expected), for respiratory diseases (M: 408 observed, 351 expected; F: 339 observed, 277 expected) and for renal failure (M: 61 observed, 41 expected; F: 52 observed, 34 expected) were observed in both genders. Among males, statistically significant excesses of hospital admissions for liver cancer (23 observed, 14 expected), Parkinson’s disease (10 observed, 4 expected) and genitourinary diseases (312 observed, 282 expected) emerged; among females statistically significant excesses of hospital admissions for oesophagus cancer (4 observed, 1 expected), for circulatory disorders of the brain (235 observed, 209 expected), for chronic-obstructive pulmonary disease (70 observed, 42 expected), and an excess close to the statistical significance for cancer of the central nervous system (22 observed, 14 expected) was observed. Congenital malformations results, which take into account births and pregnancy interruption after prenatal anomaly diagnosis show a statistically significant excess of urogenital anomalies in the SGA. Analysis of low birth weight, preterm birth and ratio O/A in males, showed no deviations from the regional references. CONCLUSIONS Overall this descriptive epidemiological study showed that the health status picture of Geothermal Area is not dissimilar from the one observed in neighbouring communities, {{with the exception of a}} worst general mortality among males. However, some mortality and hospitalization excesses are worth of note, most evident in the geothermal area of Amiata (SGA) compared to that of the province of Pisa (NGA). The overall results, showing more critical traits for males and a substantial non alignment of mortality and hospitalization, are suggestive of an etiological role of occupational exposures or individual lifestyles, even if effects of environmental factors cannot be excluded. Among the causes of death and hospitalization which showed excesses, acute respiratory diseases, with mortality excess among females in the SGA, circulatory disorders of the brain, with mortality excess among females in the NGA, respiratory system diseases and renal failure, with hospitalization excess in the SGA in both genders, are proposed for further insights. In fact, these excesses observed in areas characterized by documented presence of pollutants of different sources and great concern of the local communities, reinforced the indications for improving environmental quality and environment and health monitoring. Recommendations to the regional and local authorities for ad hoc epidemiological investigations and public health interventions were released...|$|R
