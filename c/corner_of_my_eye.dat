500|$|O'Neill Surber {{explored}} {{the lyrics of}} Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to [...] "Comfortably Numb": [...] "I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot {{put my finger on}} it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone." [...] Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, [...] "Jugband Blues": [...] "I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 July 1987, a {{day after}} Gandhi went to Sri Lanka and signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, an honour guard named Vijitha Rohana hit him on his {{shoulder}} with his rifle; Gandhi's quick reflexes saved him from injury. The guard was then dragged by his security personnel. The guard said his intention was to kill Gandhi because of [...] "the damage he had caused" [...] to Sri Lanka. Wijemuni was imprisoned for two-and-a-half years for the assault Gandhi later said about the incident: When I was inspecting the guard of honour and as I walked past one person, I saw through the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> some movement. I ducked {{down a little bit}} in a reflex action. By my ducking, he missed my head and the brunt of the blow came on my shoulder below the left ear.|$|E
60|$|This I {{said with}} a <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> in the usual quarter, towards the arts, little dreaming what destiny was to provide.|$|E
60|$|Now I, Hubert, {{watching}} Quilla out <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> saw {{her turn}} pale and tremble.|$|R
60|$|I {{glanced at}} <b>my</b> {{opponent}} out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> The man was suffering. Beads of perspiration stood {{out on his}} forehead.|$|R
60|$|We tried {{a shorter}} kite-line and a shorter length <b>of</b> <b>my</b> line, and we ran down upon that mess of tuna once more. It was strange--and foolish--how we stuck to that school of biggest fish. This time Dan headed {{right into the}} thick of them. Out <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> I seemed to see tuna {{settling}} down all around. Suddenly my brother yelled.|$|R
6000|$|... "As you see, madam mother, I am at practice," [...] I answered, {{and out of}} the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> I {{caught the}} grim {{approving}} twitch of old Falcone's lips.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} Cynthia came in. Out of the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> I {{observed}} {{a look of}} fuddled displeasure come into Tanky's face at her frank pleasure at seeing me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So, {{when the}} morning came, I {{went down to}} the beach, casting out of the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> at the house of the mother of Unga. My offer yet stood untouched.|$|E
5000|$|Plant, O God, through Thy awesomeness, {{the springs}} of humility in the {{watering}} place <b>of</b> <b>my</b> heart! Cause to flow, O God, because of Thy awesomeness, tears of moaning from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes!</b> And chastise, O God, the recklessness <b>of</b> <b>my</b> clumsiness with the reins <b>of</b> contentment! <b>My</b> God, if mercy from Thee {{does not begin}} with fair success for me, then who can take me to Thee upon the evident path? ...|$|R
60|$|Then as {{they saw}} me walk towards Claudia they understood, and I heard a burst of laughter. I took my lady's hand, and bowing deeply, kissed it with the {{greatest}} fervour. I glanced at Giulia from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and saw her {{looking down on the}} ground, with a deep blush of anger on her face. My heart leapt for joy to think that I had returned something of the agony she had caused me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then he said: 'But {{what does}} Ata say to it?' 'It appears {{that she has}} a <i beguin> for you,' I said. 'She's willing if you are. Shall I call her?' He chuckled in a funny, dry way he had, and I called her. She knew what I was talking about, the hussy, and I saw her out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> {{listening}} with all her ears, while she pretended to iron a blouse that she had been washing for me. She came. She was laughing, but I could see that she was a little shy, and Strickland looked at her without speaking." ...|$|R
60|$|As I lighted a cigar I saw, {{out of the}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye,</b> how Hoden gave a quick start. I {{expected}} {{some kind}} of a startling idea to flash into his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{told me to}} {{wait until}} I was alone with you," [...] I said, {{dropping}} my voice significantly, and watching him intently out of the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe, creating an atmosphere.|$|E
60|$|I watched Phaidor {{from the}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> She paled to a ghastly hue. Slowly, very slowly she turned, as though drawn by some {{invisible}} yet irresistible force. She was standing {{quite close to}} me, so close that her bare arm touched mine as she finally faced Issus, Goddess of Life Eternal.|$|E
60|$|Our way led {{us through}} the town where {{everybody}} seemed to be standing about doing nothing and speaking very little. There was a curious air of expectancy upon their faces. They knew that the crisis was at hand, that their nation's fate hung upon the scales, and they watched my every look and movement as though in them they expected to read an omen. I too watched them out <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> wondering whether I should escape from their savage company alive. If once the blood lust broke out among them, {{it seemed to me}} that I should have about as much chance as a chopped fox among a pack of hungry hounds.|$|R
60|$|Then {{that vision}} {{vanished}} and Ayesha's voice {{began to seem}} very far away and dreamy, also her wondrous beauty became visible to me through her veil, as though I had acquired a new sense that overcame the limitations of mortal sight. Even in this extremity I reflected it was well that the last thing I looked on should be something so glorious. No, not quite the last thing, for out <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> I saw that Umslopogaas from a sitting position had sunk on to his back and lay, apparently dead, with his axe still gripped tightly and held above his head, as though his arm had been turned to ice.|$|R
60|$|I {{returned}} {{at night}} {{by the same}} railroad {{and in the same}} kind of car. One of the passengers being exceedingly anxious to expound at great length to my companion (not to me, of course) the true principles on which books of travel in America should be written by Englishmen, I feigned to fall asleep. But glancing all the way out at window from the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> I found abundance of entertainment for the rest of the ride in watching the effects of the wood fire, which had been invisible in the morning but were now brought out in full relief by the darkness: for we were travelling in a whirlwind of bright sparks, which showered about us like a storm of fiery snow.|$|R
6000|$|I took {{a little}} look at {{him out of the}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye,</b> and wished that as a child I had paid more heed to my {{arithmetic}} lessons. [...] "Look, Mrs Monnerie," [...] I cried piteously, [...] "poor Cherry's tongue is dangling right out of his head. He looks so hot and tired." ...|$|E
60|$|You {{may think}} how proud I was {{to walk down}} the village street with my {{magnificent}} relative, and to note out of the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> how the folk came to the doors and windows to see us pass. Champion Harrison was standing outside the smithy, and he pulled his cap off when he saw my uncle.|$|E
60|$|I babbled on, till {{from the}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> I saw the flush fade from the professor's {{face and his}} back {{gradually}} relax its poker-like attitude. The situation was saved for the moment {{but there was no}} knowing what further excesses Ukridge might indulge in. I managed to draw him aside as we went through the fowl-run, and expostulated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do, if you please, my dear child," [...] {{answered}} Hepzibah. [...] "But {{put it on}} {{the table}} in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the passage. <b>My</b> <b>eyes</b> are weak; and I can seldom bear the lamplight on them." ...|$|R
40|$|In 1965, my calvinist {{high school}} class was invited for a social evening {{at the home of}} a catholic family in Den Haag. After all those {{textbooks}} on our doctrinal differences, and all our gossip about the much warmer (though of course less studious and less reliable) temperament of the other faith, every step in that house was an adventure. From the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> I quickly noticed that Catholics had two arms and two legs, just like us – in fact, the girl in charge was remarkably pretty. Moreover, the crucifixes which I expected to hang in every closet and over every door, did not materialize, and there were no tell-tale stains on the walls indicating that they had just been removed for our sake. Indeed, the whole evening was remarkable for its complete lack of remarkable events. Young Dutch Catholics were just like us, in their taste in clothes or pop music, their views from religion to politics, and even the adolescent jokes that they found funny. My initial plan for this paper was another neighbourly visit which seemed long overdue between two Stanford colleagues of some 15 years by now. I wanted to make a crisp comparison between Situation Calculus, the world of John McCarthy and his followers, and Modal Logic, my own habitat for the past decades (see Blackburn, van Benthem &...|$|R
6000|$|He {{inclined}} {{his head}} in a stately, old-world fashion, and seated himself upon the bench. Seeing that he had no wish to speak I was silent also, but I could not help watching him out <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> for he was such a wonderful survival of the early half of the century, with his low-crowned, curly-brimmed hat, his black satin tie which fastened with a buckle at the back, and, above all, his large, fleshy, clean-shaven face shot with its mesh of wrinkles. Those eyes, ere they had grown dim, had looked out from the box-seat of mail coaches, and had seen the knots of navvies as they toiled on the brown embankments. Those lips had smiled over the first numbers of [...] "Pickwick," [...] and had gossiped of the promising young man who wrote them. The face itself was a seventy-year almanack, and every seam an entry upon it where public as well as private sorrow left its trace. That pucker on the forehead stood for the Mutiny, perhaps; that line of care for the Crimean winter, it may be; and that last little sheaf <b>of</b> wrinkles, as <b>my</b> fancy hoped, for the death of Gordon. And so, as I dreamed in my foolish way, the old gentleman with the shining stock was gone, and it was seventy years of a great nation's life that took shape before me on the headland in the morning.|$|R
60|$|I bowed my best bow as the Chevalier {{presented}} me, {{and from}} the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye,</b> with inward malice, I watched them as I did so. Geneviève curtsied with a puzzled air and a sidelong glance at her sister. Yvonne accorded me the faintest, the coldest, inclination of her head, whilst her cheeks assumed a colour that was unwonted.|$|E
6000|$|The Guardian, {{whom she}} called [...] "Shaman" [...] or Magician, held a lamp in his hand, and by its light {{it was easy}} to see his face, which I watched out of the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> I thought that it wore a very strange expression, one {{moreover}} that alarmed me somewhat. From the beginning I had misdoubted me of this old man, whose cast of countenance was vindictive as it was able; now I was afraid of him.|$|E
60|$|The little beaded front-sight wavered {{slightly}} as I held my rifle leveled at the grim, snarling face, {{and out of}} the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye,</b> as it were, I saw Jones dash in under the lion and grasp Moze by the hind leg and haul him down. He broke from Jones and leaped again to the first low branch. His master then grasped his collar and carried him to where we stood and held him choking.|$|E
40|$|There in the {{periphery}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> vision, I saw blurry in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> a large man, with beau-tiful gauzy wings 14 feet across fluttering across the supermarket. I {{turned my head}} and looked closer, and saw a dangling 3 -foot penis with a red Christmas ornament on the end snaking towards me. “This is the Unsafeway! ” he sing-songed to me dancing by, “genetic engineering is the Un-safeway way! ” Behind him came a small Colombian woman with a coupon, “Value your family’s health, ” it said in a bold red banner across the top. As I glanced at the coupons for BGH milk and New Leaf potatoes, I was turned {{in the arms of}} a beautiful genie. “Super Hex Man a la orden, ” he greeted, “please, help us with our labeling ” and he handed me a strip of labels that read “warn-ing: this product contains genetically engineered material which had not been adequately tested and could be dangerous to your health. ” He was applying these to the milk in the cooler. A woman with a Hexterminator cape materialized, explaining to the growing crowd, “Safeway does not label genetically engineered foods, so you have no way to choose what you feed your family. This is the UnsafeWay, and today we want you to help us rechristen this store, Unsafeway. ” She handed out materials to the people gathered around. “We have come here today to hold this store account-able. We have come here today to label genetically engineered products ourselves. Our league o...|$|R
60|$|As I {{paused in}} a <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the room <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> fell upon Nancy's father. McAlery Willett's elation seemed even greater than Ham's. With a {{gardenia}} in his frock-coat {{and a glass}} of champagne in his hand he went from group to group; and his familiar laughter, which once had seemed so full of merriment and fun, gave me to-day a somewhat scandalized feeling. I heard Ralph's voice, and turned to discover him standing beside me, his long legs thrust slightly apart, his hands in his pockets, overlooking the scene with typical, semi-contemptuous amusement.|$|R
6000|$|So, {{with the}} wan waste grasses on my spear, I ride for ever, seeking after God. My hair grows whiter than my thistle plume, And all my limbs are loose; but in <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> The star <b>of</b> an unconquerable praise: For {{in my soul}} one hope for ever sings, That at the next white <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> a road <b>My</b> <b>eyes</b> may look on Him.... Hush--I shall know The place when it is found: a twisted path Under a twisted pear-tree--this I saw In the first dream I had ere I was born, Wherein He spoke.... But the grey clouds come down In hail upon the icy plains: I ride, Burning for ever in {{consuming}} fire.|$|R
60|$|My hands by {{this time}} were numb with cold. We had been {{ascending}} steadily, and Byfield's English thermometer stood at thirteen degrees. I borrowed from the heap a thicker overcoat, {{in the pocket of}} which I was lucky enough to find a pair of furred gloves; and leaned over for another look below, still with a <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> for the aëronaut, who stood biting his nails, as far from me as the car allowed.|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} I caught another glimpse from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> {{of the single}} pair of eyes at my back making a sudden rush upon me. I turned to meet the charge; there was a quick rush of the three from the other direction; but I {{determined}} to pursue the single pair until I {{should have at least}} settled my account with one of the beasts and thus be relieved of the strain of meeting attacks from both directions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, sir, {{he is such}} {{a mysterious}} little sacket," [...] replied Cathro, testily, [...] "and so clever at leading you into a hole, that it's not chancey to meddle with him, and I could see through the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> that, for all this woeful face, he was proud of it, and hoped I was taking note. For though {{sometimes}} his emotion masters him completely, at other times he can step aside as it were, and take an approving look at it. That is a characteristic of him, and not the least maddening one." ...|$|E
