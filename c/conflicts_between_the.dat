5|$|Although {{threatening}} letters sent to BélaIV by the khans of the Golden Horde {{proved that}} the danger of a new Mongol invasion still existed, he adopted an expansionist foreign policy. FrederickII of Austria died fighting against Hungarian troops in 1246, and BélaIV's son-in-law, Rostislav Mikhailovich, annexed large territories along the kingdom's southern frontiers. <b>Conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> elderly monarch and his heir, Stephen, caused a {{civil war in the}} 1260s.|$|E
5|$|Following Suleiman's {{unsuccessful}} Siege of Vienna in 1529, Ferdinand {{launched a}} counter-attack in 1530 {{to regain the}} initiative and avenge the destruction brought by Suleiman's 120,000 strong army. This campaign is usually considered as {{the start of the}} Little War, the period of a series <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Habsburgs and the Ottoman Empire. An assault of Buda was driven off by John Zápolya, the vassal King of Hungary, but Ferdinand was successful elsewhere, capturing Gran (Esztergom) and other forts along the Danube river, a vital strategic frontier.|$|E

40|$|On the Coping with <b>the</b> <b>Conflict</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Co-facilitators in the Encounter Group The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the coping with <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two co-facilitators in the encounter group. A questionnaire was administered to 64 encounter group facilitators. The questionnaire asks the subjects to describe their coping with <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two co-facilitators in two encounter groups; good relation group and bad one. By the explolatory research method (Hayashi 1987), I find that the coping with <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two co-facilitators in the encounter group was influenced by 4 factors; the accordance of the view of facilitator, the existing trust relationship, equal relationship, the independence as a facilitators. 10 typical case patterns were explored as the new assumptions about the coping with <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two co-facilitators in the encounter group...|$|R

5|$|Fort Cumberland {{was located}} on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which connects modern {{mainland}} Nova Scotia with New Brunswick. The area was strategically important in earlier <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> French colony of Acadia and British-controlled Nova Scotia. Originally built by the French in 1750 as Fort Beauséjour, Fort Cumberland was in deplorable condition. Won from the French in the Battle of Fort Beauséjour in 1755, the fortifications had been minimally garrisoned by the British after the Seven Years' War and abandoned in 1768.|$|E
5|$|Indian Wars is {{the name}} {{generally}} used in the United States to describe a series of <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> colonial or {{federal government and the}} native people of North America. The wars, which ranged from the 17th-century to the early 1900s, generally resulted in the opening of Native American lands to further colonization, the conquest of American Indians and their assimilation, or forced relocation to Indian reservations.|$|E
5|$|Nairobi National Park is a {{national}} park in Kenya. Established in 1946, the national park was Kenya's first. It is located approximately 7 kilometres (4mi) south of the centre of Nairobi, Kenya's capital city, with an electric fence separating the park's wildlife from the metropolis. Nairobi's skyscrapers {{can be seen from}} the park. The proximity of urban and natural environments has caused <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> animals and local people and threatens animals' migration routes.|$|E

5000|$|As Maria was {{not able}} to {{become a member of the}} Guild she was forced to work in her family's workshop, without being able to sign her own output, and indeed {{probably}} having her work signed by her male relations. [...] <b>The</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>between</b> Maria and <b>the</b> Guild has also been interpreted as a <b>conflict</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Renaissance style and the new Baroque movement rather than solely as a <b>conflict</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> sexes.|$|R
5|$|Newton Heath LYR Football Club {{was also}} founded as a cricket club, and the North Road ground {{was used by}} both {{branches}} of the club. However, the cricket and football seasons often overlapped, causing <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two sports. The ground was barely adequate for football, despite {{the best efforts of}} groundsmen Charlie and Ned Massey, but its use in the winter made it even less suitable for cricket in the summer.|$|E
5|$|That summer, both couples {{moved into}} nearby summer homes. In November, they {{returned}} to Pisa and met Lord Byron, who had recently arrived there himself. The two couples later shared {{a house in a}} remote location near Lerici, where they were visited in early 1822 by Edward John Trelawny. Though they enjoyed each other's company, the house was small and the arrangements led to numerous <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> servants of each family.|$|E
5|$|The Communist Party USA was {{routinely}} harassed and {{oppressed by}} government officials, leading {{it to be}} the primary client of the ACLU. The Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, and this led to frequent <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Communists and ACLU. Communist leaders often attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights of conservatives. This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.|$|E

5|$|The first {{assemblies}} of the Republic {{emerged during}} the Kingdom, with their use to ratify regal elections and the repurposing of the comitia centuriata to elect the first consuls.

He and Gardner often disagree on what makes a good trade, which can lead to minor <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two and the shop's other employees.|$|E
5|$|Abir re-established their {{headquarters}} at Basankusu in 1893 and its {{position at the}} confluence of the Maringa and Lopori allowed Abir to expand along the rivers and their tributaries, establishing new posts along the way. Progress was slow as the Free State's activities had made the population in the west hostile to colonisation and the east remained in the control of the Manyema and the Zanzibari slavers. The company's first post on the Lopori River had to be relocated because of threats from locals and rubber collection at Befori began only after a series of bloody <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> villagers and Abir's men.|$|E

5|$|Avram Steuerman-Rodion, {{a socialist}} based in Iași, contributed a special series of {{articles}} documenting the growth of Germanophila in that city, and throughout Moldavia region. Titled Scrisori din Iași ("Letters from Iași"), it notably chronicled the <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> enthusiastically Ententist University of Bucharest professors and their more skeptical University of Iași colleagues. Seara also enlisted contributions from physician Ottoi Călin, {{a member of the}} PSDR Executive Committee and author of its Zimmerwald pacifist manifesto. Despite this agenda, Ottoi was not employed as a political panelist, but, as a practicing physician, held Searas advice column.|$|E
5|$|Despite its rapid {{gains and}} popular backing, the new {{administration}} was marked by <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> radical wing and more conservative forces, especially {{over the issue of}} land reform. Two successive abortive coups were able to weaken the Government, and its international status was always contested by Russia. After managing to rally a degree of sympathy from Ottoman political leaders, the Revolution was ultimately isolated by the intervention of Russian diplomats, and ultimately repressed by a common intervention of Ottoman and Russian armies, without any significant form of armed resistance. Nevertheless, over the following decade, the completion of its goals was made possible by the international context, and former revolutionaries became the original political class in united Romania.|$|E
5|$|Don Juan Manuel de Rosas became {{governor}} of Buenos Aires after the {{brief period of}} anarchy {{following the end of}} the Cisplatine War in 1828. In theory, Rosas only held as much power as governors of the other Argentine provinces, but in reality he ruled over the entire Argentine Confederation, as the country was then known. Although {{he was one of the}} Federalists, a faction which demanded greater provincial autonomy, in practice Rosas exercised control over the other provinces and become the virtual dictator of Argentina. During his 20-year government, the country witnessed the resurgence of armed <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Unitarians (his rival political faction) and the Federalists.|$|E

5|$|In 1780, {{at the age}} {{of twenty}} years, he was {{promoted}} to captain, and assigned to the 34th Infantry Regiment, also known as the Anton Esterházy, named for Paul II Anton Esterházy, the general of cavalry, field marshal of the Seven Years' War, and ambassador to Britain. While he was assigned to this unit, he participated in the border <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire and the Habsburgs, 1787–92, and stormed the fortress at Šabac (German: Schabatz) on the Sava River in Serbia on 27 April 1788.

5|$|On 22 June 1399, Jadwiga {{gave birth}} to a {{daughter}}, baptised Elizabeth Bonifacia, but within a month the mother and daughter died, leaving Władysław sole ruler of the Kingdom of Poland and without an heir nor much legitimacy to rule the kingdom. Jadwiga's death undermined Władysław's right to the throne, and as a result old <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> nobility of Lesser Poland, generally sympathetic to Władysław, and the gentry of Greater Poland began to surface. In 1402, Władysław answered the rumblings against his rule by marrying Anna of Celje, a granddaughter of Casimir III of Poland, a political match that re-legitimised his reign.|$|E
5|$|P.exclamans are haplodiploid insects, as {{are other}} Polistes species {{including}} Polistes metricus, Polistes dominula, and Polistes annularis. This means they have haploid males that produce identical haploid sperm, and diploid females that produce haploid eggs through meiosis. This has consequences for genetic relatedness within colonies, since sisters receive identical sperm if {{they share a}} father, and the normal half identical contribution from the mother. This results in sex-biased <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> queen and the workers {{with respect to the}} sex ratio, with workers preferring a more female biased sex ratio, and queens preferring equal investment in queens and males.|$|E
