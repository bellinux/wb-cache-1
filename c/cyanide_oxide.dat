40|$|The {{dose-response}} relationship between number of cigarettes smoked and risk for lung cancer {{was established in}} 1950 by epidemiological studies. Laboratory assays with tobacco tar on mouse skin and smoke inhalation experiments with hamsters provided further evidence for this relationship. In cigarette smoke, among 4800 identified compounds, 69 are carcinogens, and several are tumor promoters or cocarcinogens. The major toxic agents are nicotine, carbon monoxide, hydrogen <b>cyanide,</b> nitrogen <b>oxides,</b> some volatile aldehydes, some alkenes, and some aromatic hydrocarbons.

Intervention studies were augmented with attempts of risk reduction by changing the tobacco composition and makeup of cigarettes. This led to cigarettes that, according to the FTC, reduced the tar and nicotine yields from an average of 37 and 2. 7 mg to 12 and 0. 85 mg.

Mainstream cannabis smoke was found to contain higher concentrations of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) than sidestream tobacco smoke.

40|$|Cytochrome bd is {{a unique}} prokaryotic {{respiratory}} terminal oxidase that {{does not belong to}} the extensively investigated family of haem-copper oxidases (HCOs). The enzyme catalyses the four-electron reduction of O 2 to 2 H 2 O, using quinols as physiological reducing substrates. The reaction is electrogenic and cytochrome bd therefore sustains bacterial energy metabolism by contributing to maintain the transmembrane proton motive force required for ATP synthesis. As compared to HCOs, cytochrome bd displays several distinctive features in terms of (i) metal composition (it lacks Cu and harbours a d-type haem in addition to two haems b), (ii) overall three-dimensional structure, that only recently has been solved, and arrangement of the redox cofactors, (iii) lesser energetic efficiency (it is not a proton pump), (iv) higher O 2 affinity, (v) higher resistance to inhibitors such as <b>cyanide,</b> nitric <b>oxide</b> (NO) and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) and (vi) ability to efficiently metabolize potentially toxic reactive oxygen and nitrogen species like hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Compelling evidence suggests that, beyond its bioenergetic role, cytochrome bd plays multiple functions in bacterial physiology and affords protection against oxidative and nitrosative stress. Relevant to human pathophysiology, thanks to its peculiar properties, the enzyme has been shown to promote virulence in several bacterial pathogens, being currently recognized as a target for the development of new antibiotics. This review aims to give an update on our current understanding of bd-type oxidases with a focus on their reactivity with gaseous ligands and its potential impact on bacterial physiology and human pathophysiology...|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{inhibitory}} effects of PBE against Fe 2 +and SNP-induced lipid peroxidation were assessed. Lipid peroxidation {{is a free}} radical-mediated process involving lipid-derived radicals, such as alkoxyl and peroxyl radicals, wherein oxidative damage is propagated to polyunsaturated fatty acids. The toxicity of Fe (II) proceeds via the Fenton reaction where iron catalyses one-electron transfer reactions that generate reactive oxygen species, such as the OH.- from H 2 O 2. Iron is capable of decomposing lipid peroxides leading to the generation of peroxyl and alkoxyl radicals and favouring the propagation of lipid oxidation [25]. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), on the other hand, {{has been reported to}} cause cytotoxicity through the release of <b>cyanide</b> and/or nitric <b>oxide</b> [27]. The released NO is capable of causing neuronal damage in cooperation with other reactive oxygen species (ROS) notably superoxide radical to form peroxynitrite radical [28]. The considerable inhibition of SNP-induced lipid peroxidation by PBE could be attributed to the ability of the extract to scavenge NO˙ radical produced by the SNP, thus protecting the tissues against oxidative insults [28].|$|R
50|$|Near-infrared {{spectroscopy}} is used {{in astronomy}} for studying the atmospheres of cool stars where molecules can form.

It is also used for studying molecules in other astronomical contexts, such as in molecular clouds where new stars are formed. The astronomical phenomenon known as reddening means that near-infrared wavelengths are less affected by dust in the interstellar medium, such that regions inaccessible by optical spectroscopy can be studied in the near-infrared. Since dust and gas are strongly associated, these dusty regions are exactly those where infrared spectroscopy is most useful. The near-infrared spectra of very young stars provide important information about their ages and masses, which is important for understanding star formation in general. Astronomical spectrographs have also been developed for the detection of exoplanets using the Doppler shift of the parent star due to the radial velocity of the planet around the star.|$|R

From urine, we simultaneously quantified 28 VOC metabolites of exposure to acrolein, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, benzene, 1 -bromopropane, 1, 3 -butadiene, carbon disulfide, crotonaldehyde, cyanide, N,N-dimethylformamide, ethylbenzene, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, styrene, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, trichloroethylene, vinyl chloride, and xylene exposures using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI/MSMS) method. Urinary thiocyanate was measured using an ion chromatography coupled with an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method (IC-ESI/MSMS). We modeled the relationship between urinary VOC metabolite concentrations and sources of VOC exposure. Sources of exposure were assessed by participant report via questionnaire (use of air fresheners, aerosols, paint or varnish, organic solvents, and passive/active smoking) and by observations by a trained data collector (presence of scented products in homes). We found several significant (p < 0. 01) relationships between the urinary metabolites of VOCs and sources of VOC exposure.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Chloroperoxidase (CPO) is {{the most}} {{versatile}} of the known heme enzymes. It catalyzes chlorination of activated C-H bonds, as well as peroxidase, catalase and cytochrome P 450 reactions, including enantioselective epoxidation. CPO contains a proximal heme-thiolate ligand, like P 450, and polar distal pocket, like peroxidase. The substrate-binding site is formed by an opening above the heme that enables organic substrates to approach the activated oxoferryl oxygen atom. CPO, unlike other peroxidases, utilizes a glutamate acid-base catalyst, rather than a histidine residue. Results: The crystal structures of CPO complexed with exogenous ligands, carbon monoxide, nitric <b>oxide,</b> <b>cyanide</b> and thiocyanate, have been determined. The distal pocket discriminates ligands {{on the basis of}} size and pKa. The refined CPO-ligand structures indicate a rigid active-site architecture with an immobile glutamate acid-base catalyst. Molecular modeling and dynamics simulations of CPO with the substrate cis-β-methyl styrene and the corresponding epoxide products provide a structural and energetic basis for understanding the enantioselectivity of CPO-catalyzed epoxidation reactions. Conclusions: The various CPO-ligand structures provide the basis for a detailed stereochemical mechanism of the formation of the intermediate compound I, in which Glu 183 acts as an acid-base catalyst. The observed rigidity in the active site also explains the relative instability of CPO compound I and the formation of the HOCI chlorinating species. Energetics of CPO-substrate/product molecular modeling provides a theoretical basis for the P 450 -type enantioselective epoxidation activities of CPO...|$|R
40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed November 29, 2010) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 29 - 34) Cigarette butts {{are the most common}} form of litter worldwide, as an estimated 4. 5 trillion cigarette butts are deposited somewhere into the environment every year. With cigarette consumption on the rise globally, along with the increasing popularity of bans on indoor smoking, the global environmental burden of cigarette waste may increase in the years to come. Many chemical products are used during the course of growing tobacco and manufacturing cigarettes, the residues of which may be found in cigarettes consumed and therefore in the butts discarded. These include pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and rodenticides. Additionally, over 4, 000 chemicals may also be introduced to the ambient environment via combusted cigarette particulate matter (tar) and mainstream smoke. These include chemicals such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen <b>cyanide,</b> nitrogen <b>oxides,</b> polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, ammonia, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, benzene, phenol, argon, pyridines, and acetone, over fifty of which are known to be carcinogenic to humans. Furthermore, chemicals such as arsenic, nicotine, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy metals have been found to leach into the environment from cigarette butts littered along roadsides and in laboratory studies Using standard acute fish bioassays, cigarette butts were analyzed for aquatic toxicity. The LC 50 for leachate from smoked cigarette butts (with remnant tobacco intact) was approximately 1. 1 cigarette butts/L for both the marine topsmelt (Atherinops affinis) and the freshwater fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Leachate from smoked cigarette filters (remnant tobacco removed), was less toxic, with LC 50 values of 4. 1 and 5. 5 cigarette butts/L, respectively for both fish species. Lastly, unsmoked cigarette filters (no tobacco) were also found to be toxic, with LC 50 values of 5. 1 and 13. 5 cigarette butts/L, respectively for both fish species. Consequently, toxicity of cigarette butt leachate was found to increase with smoking the cigarette, and again with leaving remnant burnt tobacco intact. Additionally, the marine topsmelt was found to be more sensitive to most cigarette butt leachates than was the freshwater fathead minnow. This study represents the first in the literature to investigate the toxicity of cigarette butts to fish, and will assist in assessing the potential ecological risks of cigarette butts to the aquatic environment...|$|R

The research proposed that organic nitrites, nitro <b>oxide,</b> <b>cyanides,</b> and isocyanides of cigarette smoke interfere with vitamin B 12 metabolism, and convert it to inactive forms. This research was carried out to determine the serum level of active and inactive forms of vitamin B 12 in male smokers in comparison with male nonsmokers. This is a case-control study, in which the participants were 85 male smokers and 85 male nonsmokers. The serum levels of total and active form of vitamin B 12 were measured. Dietary intake was recorded by a quantitative food frequency questionnaire and one-day 24 -hour dietary recall method. Independent two sample T {{test was used to}} compare quantitative variables between the case and control groups.

40|$|Catalase is {{resistant}} to oxidizing agents; e. g., ferricyanide. It is also {{resistant to}} reducing agents; e. g., catalytically activated hydrogen, hydrosulfite, ferrotartrate, cysteine. The hemin {{group of the}} enzyme will combine with <b>cyanide,</b> sulfides, nitric <b>oxide,</b> fluoride. It will not combine with carbon monoxide. Catalase is therefore a ferric complex. The stability of the ferric iron in the enzyme toward reducing agents is not due {{to the structure of}} the porphyrin with which it is combined. This porphyrin is the protoporphyrin of the blood pigment. In combination with globin (methemoglobin) the ferric iron is readily reduced by the same reagents which have no effect on catalase. The stability of the ferric iron in the enzyme is therefore due to the protein component. It may be that the type of hematin-protein linkage in catalase is the reason for this phenomenon. The suggestion of Bersin (31), that sulfur may participate in this linkage, is interesting but, as yet, has no experimental basis. Hydrazine or pyridine and hydrosulfite convert catalase into hemochromogens containing ferrous iron. But in these hemochromogens the hematin is no longer attached to the protein. This has been replaced by the nitrogenous bases hydrazine and pyridine. Both hemochromogens combine reversibly with carbon monoxide. Photo-dissociation has only been demonstrated {{in the case of the}} pyridine hemochromogen. The positions of the absorption bands of catalase and its derivatives are listed in Table II. The main absorption band (Soret's band) of hemin complexes with nitrogenous substances (nitrogen bases, proteins) is situated at the border between the visible and the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. It has now been found that the spectrum of purified liver catalase has a well defined maximum of high extinction in this range, at 409 mµ.

The effects of compounds modifying the levels of the ethylene co-product <b>cyanide</b> and nitric <b>oxide</b> (NO) on fruit physiology were also studied. Results suggested that: 1) The ethylene treatment caused sub-lethal stress since it induced stress-related responses and reduced peel damage; 2) 1 -MCP induced ethylenedependent and ethylene-independent responsive networks; 3) 1 -MCP triggered ethylene overproduction, stress-related responses and metabolic shifts aimed to cope with cell toxicity, which mostly affected to the inner part of the peel (albedo); 4) 1 -MCP increased respiration and drove metabolism reconfiguration for favoring energy conservation but up-regulated genes related to lipid and protein degradation and triggered the over-expression of genes associated with the plasma membrane cellular component; 5) Xenobiotics and/or reactive oxygen species (ROS) might act as signals for defense responses in the ethylene-treated fruit, while their uncontrolled generation would induce processes mimicking cell death and damage in 1 -MCP-treated fruit; 6) ROS, the ethylene co-product cyanide and NO may converge in the toxic effects of 1 -MCP.
