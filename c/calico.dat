5|$|After independence, modern {{buildings}} {{appeared in}} Ahmedabad. Architects given commissions {{in the city}} included Louis Kahn, who designed the IIM-A; Le Corbusier, who designed the Shodhan and Sarabhai Villas, the Sanskar Kendra and the Mill Owner's Association Building, and Frank Lloyd Wright, who designed the administrative building of <b>Calico</b> Mills and the <b>Calico</b> Dome. B. V. Doshi came to the city from Paris to supervise Le Corbusier's works and later set up the School of Architecture. His local works include Sangath, Amdavad ni Gufa and the School of Architecture. Charles Correa, who became a partner of Doshi's, designed the Gandhi Ashram and Achyut Kanvinde, and the Indian Textile Industries Research Association. Christopher Charles Benninger's first work, the Alliance Française, {{is located in the}} Ellis Bridge area. Anant Raje designed major additions to Louis Kahn's IIM-A campus, namely the Ravi Mathai Auditorium and KLMD.|$|E

5|$|Static dummy {{tanks and}} guns were made mainly of local {{materials}} including <b>calico</b> and palm-frond hurdles. Some dummy tanks were mobile, consisting of light frames placed over jeeps. A total of 500 dummy tanks and 150 dummy guns were constructed.|$|E
5|$|Robert Peel (1723– 12 September 1795), {{commonly}} known as Parsley Peel, was an influential cotton mill owner and grandfather to Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, future prime minister of Great Britain. Peel started life as a yeoman farmer but experimented with <b>calico</b> printing, eventually creating a parsley leaf pattern which would become his trademark. Despite losing a number of machines during riots, Peel's company became {{the largest in the}} textile sector by the time of his death, with 23 factories.|$|E
5|$|East coast trade hummed, with goods {{arriving}} from Golkonda where rice, millet, pulses and tobacco were grown {{on a large}} scale. Dye crops of indigo and chay root were produced for the weaving industry. A mineral rich region, Machilipatnam was the gateway for high quality iron and steel exports. Diamond mining {{was active in the}} Kollur region. The cotton weaving industry produced two types of cottons, plain <b>calico</b> and muslin (brown, bleached or dyed). Cloth printed with coloured patterns crafted by native techniques were exported to Java and the Far East. Golkonda specialised in plain cotton and Pulicat in printed. The main imports on the east coast were non-ferrous metals, camphor, porcelain, silk and luxury goods.|$|E

50|$|Textiles {{imported}} from India, types of colored <b>calicoes</b> which were called Indiennes, were also widely adopted and manufactured, especially in Marseille, {{although there were}} difficulties in obtaining comparable dyes, especially the red dye madder.|$|R
5|$|Louis Prang {{was born}} 12 March 1824 in Breslau. At {{the age of}} 13 he began apprenticing for his father and learned to dye and print <b>calico,</b> as well as wood and metal engraving. Prang emigrated to Boston in 1850 and became an {{illustrator}} {{for a number of}} local publications. Starting a business partnership in 1856 to manufacture copper and lithographic plates, Prang became sole proprietor in 1860 and named the company L. Prang & Co. He specialized in color printing, more specifically “chromolithography” Prang spent over four decades studying and creating a standard of colors and engraved and printed maps, prints of contemporary celebrities, and color reproductions of famous works of art.|$|E
5|$|The Sanskar Kendra, one of {{the several}} {{buildings}} in Ahmedabad designed by Le Corbusier, is a city museum depicting its history, art, culture and architecture. The Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya and the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Memorial have permanent displays of photographs, documents and other articles relating to Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel.

In 1849, Payne becan to purchase parcels of land that he would later construct the house on. The main block {{of the house was}} erected in 1855–1856 and later expanded with a north wing in the mid-1870s. The final major addition was an ell {{on the west side of}} the house, the date of construction occurred prior to 1902. Though the house has been the subject of some alterations, these changes are largely inconspicuous.|$|E

60|$|The kind liberty granted us {{of wearing}} Indian stuffs, and <b>calicoes,</b> to gratify the vanity and folly of our women; which, beside the profit to England, is an unconceivable loss to us; forcing the weavers to beg in our streets, or {{transport}} themselves to foreign countries.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 17th century {{large numbers}} of Huguenot weavers arrived in the East End, {{settling}} to service an industry that grew up around the new estate at Spitalfields, where master weavers were based. They brought with them a tradition of 'reading clubs', where books were read, often in public houses. The authorities were suspicious of immigrants meeting and in some ways they were right to be as these grew into workers' associations and political organisations. Towards the middle of the 18th century the silk industry fell into a decline – partly due to the introduction of printed <b>calico</b> cloth – and riots ensued. These 'Spitalfield Riots' of 1769 were actually centred to the east and were put down with considerable force, culminating in two men being hanged in front of the Salmon and Ball public house at Bethnal Green. One was John Doyle (an Irish weaver), the other John Valline (of Huguenot descent).|$|E
5|$|On February 23, 1854, Irataba, Cairook, {{and other}} Mohave people {{encountered}} an expedition led by military officers Amiel Whipple and J.C. Ives, {{as the group}} approached the Colorado en route to California. Whipple and his men counted six hundred Mohave gathered near their camp, trading corn, beans, squash, and wheat for beads and <b>calico.</b> By {{the end of their}} commerce, the party had purchased six bushels of corn and two hundred pounds of flour. The Mohave played a traditional game played with a hoop and pole, and the two groups entertained themselves with target practice, the Mohave using bows and arrows and the whites firing pistols and rifles. When the expedition had difficulty crossing the Colorado on February 27, several Mohave jumped into the water and helped salvage the supplies.|$|E
5|$|The group {{assumes that}} {{completing}} this task {{will result in}} the granting of their wishes. The Wicked Witch of the West (Miss Piggy) sees them coming and consults with her pet Foo-Foo and her henchman Johnny Fiama. When the Wicked Witch of the West plans to have either her pack of 40 great man-eating wolves, a flock of 40 crows of despair, a swarm of angry black bees, a group of vicious squirrels, or a group of bloodthirsty cockatoos to do away with them, Johnny tells her that the animals that work for her are unavailable due to various reasons. This forces her to resort to using her Magic Biker Cap to call Sal Minella and the other Flying Monkeys (played by Sweetums, Crazy Harry, Black Dog, <b>Calico,</b> Old Tom, Spotted Dick, and Aretha from Fraggle Rock) to deal with them. The Witch and the Flying Monkeys capture Dorothy and Lion while Scarecrow and Tin Thing are dismantled by the Flying Monkeys.|$|E
50|$|As in {{most other}} breeds, Japanese Bobtails may have almost any color (or colors, {{arranged}} {{in any number of}} patterns). Predominantly-white <b>calicoes</b> (literally 'triple-') are especially favored by the Japanese and by cat fanciers, and strongly represented in folklore, though other colorations are also accepted by breed standards.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not to-day," [...] {{answered}} Miss Annie, after {{throwing a}} despairing glance upon the rolls of <b>calicoes,</b> the coils of clothes-lines, the battered tin boxes {{of tea and}} sugar, the dusty and chimneyless kerosene lamps, and the long rows of canned goods with their gaudy labels; and then she departed.|$|R
60|$|We {{concealed}} our {{having any}} gold or pearls {{as much as}} we could, and therefore sold three or four bales of China silks and Indian <b>calicoes,</b> to raise money to buy camels and to pay the customs which are taken at several places, and for our provisions over the deserts.|$|R
25|$|What {{is left of}} Ghost Town {{today was}} based on <b>Calico</b> ghost town and other real ghost towns in the Western United States such as Prescott, Arizona. Walter Knott {{inherited}} his uncle's silver mill and land, then bought more of the actual <b>Calico</b> ghost town in 1951 and developed it. In 1966, he donated that property to the corporate-municipal County of San Bernardino which then made the town of <b>Calico,</b> California into a public historic park, for which it charged an entrance/parking fee. See 'History– Ghost Town– Calico' section above.|$|E

Together, they evaluate anonymized data from millions of public family trees and a growing database of over one million genetic samples. AncestryDNA and <b>Calico</b> will work together to analyze and investigate the role of genetics and its influences in families experiencing unusual longevity using Ancestry's proprietary databases, tools and algorithms. <b>Calico</b> will then focus its efforts to develop and commercialize any potential therapeutics that emerge from the analysis.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 17th century three {{localised}} {{areas of}} textile production could be identified in Lancashire. Linen was woven in the west of the county and in Manchester while in upland Pennine regions, woollens were woven and in central Lancashire the emphasis was on fustians, cloth made with a linen warp and wool weft. In central Lancashire weavers subsequently switched to <b>calico,</b> cloth with a cotton warp and a cotton weft. In the 1790s, the demand for <b>calico</b> expanded and more towns switched to cotton weaving producing cloth for the emerging printing industry.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} we rambled about, and found a happy little community, {{comparatively}} free from many deplorable evils to which {{the rest of their}} countrymen are subject. Their time, too, was more occupied. To my surprise, the manufacture of tappa was going on in several buildings. European <b>calicoes</b> were seldom seen, and not many articles of foreign origin of any description.|$|R
5000|$|... 2000 was {{generally}} reported {{as a bad}} year for the band; {{they were unable to}} play shows regularly because in addition to recording difficulties, their drummer left. They were able to get Rodney from the <b>Calicoes</b> to fill in occasionally, and thus played at Cornerstone and other festivals. Also, one night their van caught fire and was totaled, though they still managed to play that night.|$|R
60|$|James bought {{very little}} stock in these days: just {{remnants}} and pieces for his immortal robes. It was Miss Pinnegar {{who saw the}} travellers and ordered the unions and <b>calicoes</b> and grey flannel. James hovered round and said the last word, of course. But what was his last word but an echo of Miss Pinnegar's penultimate! He {{was not interested in}} unions and twills.|$|R
