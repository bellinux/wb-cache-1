25|$|If a {{material}} with high strength in tension, such as steel, {{is placed in}} concrete, then the composite material, reinforced concrete, resists not only compression but also bending and other direct tensile actions. A reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>section</b> where the concrete resists the compression and steel resists the tension can be made into almost any shape and size for the construction industry.|$|E
40|$|In {{designing}} a flexural member for structural safety, both the flexural {{strength and ductility}} have to be considered. For this purpose, the flexural ductility of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>sections</b> has been studied quite extensively. As there have been relatively few studies on the flexural ductility of prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sections,</b> it is not well understood how various structural parameters affect the flexural ductility. In the present study, the full-range flexural responses of reinforced and prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sections</b> are analyzed {{taking into account the}} nonlinearity and stress-path dependence of constitutive materials. From the numerical results, the effects of steel content, yield strength and degree of prestressing on the yield curvature and ultimate curvature are evaluated. It is found that whilst the concept of flexural ductility in terms of the ductility factor works well for reinforced sections, it can be misleading when applied to prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sections.</b> For prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sections,</b> the concept of flexural deformability in terms of ultimate curvature times overall depth of section may be more appropriate. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|A {{waterstop}} is {{an element}} of a concrete structure, intended to prevent the passages of fluids (such as water) when embedded in and running continuously through concrete joints. Waterstops are grouped in two distinct categories. Waterstops for joints without any movement of the adjoint <b>concrete</b> <b>sections</b> (construction cold joints) and waterstops for joints with movement of the adjoint <b>concrete</b> <b>sections</b> (dilation joints).|$|R
25|$|Cracking of the <b>concrete</b> <b>section</b> {{is nearly}} {{impossible}} to prevent; however, the size and location of cracks can be limited and controlled by appropriate reinforcement, control joints, curing methodology and concrete mix design. Cracking can allow moisture to penetrate and corrode the reinforcement. This is a serviceability failure in limit state design. Cracking is normally the result of an inadequate quantity of rebar, or rebar spaced at too great a distance. The concrete then cracks either under excess loading, or due to internal effects such as early thermal shrinkage while it cures.|$|E
25|$|Old Georgetown Road {{is part of}} the {{original}} highway between Rockville and Georgetown. This course was used by portions of General Edward Braddock's army from Alexandria, Virginia, to Cumberland, Maryland, {{prior to the start of}} the ill-fated Braddock Expedition in 1755. The Rockville and Georgetown Turnpike, which opened in 1818, included a descent into the valley of Rock Creek that bypassed MD 187's portion of the RockvilleGeorgetown highway. The portion of Old Georgetown Road from that turnpike (now MD 355) in Bethesda to the community of Alta Vista at Cedar Lane was paved as a macadam road by Montgomery County with state aid by 1910. MD 187 was extended to what is now Democracy Boulevard in 1924. The highway was extended as a macadam road to Tuckerman Lane in 1928. MD 187 was completed with a <b>concrete</b> <b>section</b> northeast to U.S. Route 240 (now MD 355) in 1929.|$|E
500|$|On November 1, DWR {{director}} Grant Davis said, [...] "Lake Oroville’s {{main spillway}} is indeed ready to safely handle winter flows if needed". While this completes phase 1 of the construction, {{there remains a}} phase 2 {{to be completed in}} 2018. The second phase would include rebuilding the top section of the spillway (which was not rebuilt this season), putting slabs over the roller compacted <b>concrete</b> <b>section,</b> constructing a concrete secant cutoff wall for the emergency spillway. The cost estimate at this point is over $500 million. Things that added to the cost included relocating power lines, dredging the river downstream of the dam, as well as the discovery that the bedrock under the spillway was weak, necessitating deeper excavations and more concrete.|$|E
40|$|The article {{introduces}} non-iterative semi-empirical expressions {{to apply}} a rigorous method {{for the design of}} transverse reinforcement of <b>concrete</b> <b>sections.</b> This iterative method defines the amount of transverse reinforcement required to balance the loss of strength due to loss of section cover. The method makes explicit use of models for confined and unconfined concrete. The proposed expressions are calibrated by a parametric study for square sections. Sections designed using these expressions and ACI guidelines are compared in terms of their cyclic response. This is achieved using an advanced hysteretic model for reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>sections...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a method of}} evaluating the ultimate strength capacities of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>sections</b> of arbitrary shapes and with or without voids subjected to axial compression and biaxial bending. The concept of load fraction is introduced so as to provide a quantitative measure of structural adequacy. An iterative procedure to determine the load fractions is proposed. Necessary integration over arbitrary domains is dealt with by boundary integration method. This procedure can be computerized readily to high automation. A wide range of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>sections</b> are analysed, as examples, using a desk-top computer. © 1985. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{procedure}} is {{proposed for the}} assessment of reinforced rectangular concrete columns under combined biaxial bending and axial loads and for the design of a correct amount of FRP-strengthening for underdesigned <b>concrete</b> <b>sections.</b> Approximate closed-form equations are developed based on the load contour method originally proposed by Bresler for reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>sections.</b> The 3 D failure surface is approximated along its contours, at a constant axial load, by means of equations given as the sum of the acting/resisting moment ratio in the directions of principal axes of the sections, raised to a power depending on the axial load, the steel reinforcement ratio, and the section shape. The method is extended to FRP-strengthened sections. Moreover, to make it possible to apply the load contour method in a more practical way, simple closed-form equations are developed for rectangular reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>sections</b> with a two-way steel reinforcement and FRP strengthenings on each side. A comparison between the approach proposed and the fiber method (which is considered exact) shows that the simplified equations correctly represent the section interaction diagram...|$|R

2500|$|The first [...] <b>concrete</b> <b>section</b> of MD 86 was {{constructed}} from Manchester in 1925. [...] A second section {{was completed in}} 1928. [...] MD 86 was completed as a concrete road through Lineboro to the Pennsylvania state line in 1929 and 1930. [...] Around 2008, {{in conjunction with the}} construction of residential subdivisions, the MD 30MD 86 intersection was modified to prohibit left turns from MD 30 to MD 86 to improve traffic flow on MD 30. [...] The possibility of turning the intersection into a right-in/right-out intersection allowing access to and from MD 86 only from northbound MD 30 was considered but postponed for further study. [...] The right-in/right-out configuration may be implemented in the future, which would require both directions of traffic between MD 86 and southbound MD 30 to use Hallie Avenue as a connector.|$|E
2500|$|The tunnel flooded on 16 August 2003 {{after the}} {{automatic}} pumping system failed to sufficiently drain the natural reservoir for water.

A 12-tonne <b>concrete</b> <b>section</b> fell down 28 December 2003, causing the tunnel to close for a week. The tunnel was closed again on 16 January 2004 after geological surveys found a section of unstable rock. Further surveys revealed that the geological evaluations during construction had overestimated the quality of the rock and hence not implemented sufficient countermeasures. As a temporary measure a tentative ferry service was established from February. The issues cost NOK35 million to resolve, and the tunnel could re-open on 2 April.|$|E
