5|$|Many {{amphibians}} <b>catch</b> <b>their</b> prey by flicking out {{an elongated}} tongue with a sticky tip and drawing {{it back into}} the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws. Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage. The enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey.|$|E
5|$|The Kangaroos {{never forgot}} their roots and {{continued}} to work in Canada off and on through the years; in addition to Stampede Wrestling, the team also worked for NWA All-Star Wrestling based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Costello featured in a National Film Board of Canada short subject La Lotta/Wrestling/Le <b>Catch.</b> <b>Their</b> stint in NWA All-Star Wrestling {{was the last time}} Costello and Heffernan teamed together. In June 1965, The Kangaroos lost to Don Leo Jonathan and Jim Hardy and then split up. Heffernan had left Australia to tour the world in 1953 and wanted to return to his homeland, while Costello was determined to remain in the United States for a while longer.|$|E
5|$|On the German {{side of the}} lines, Voss {{had changed}} clothing. He wore a {{colourful}} civilian silk dress shirt beneath his unbuttoned knee-length brown leather coat. His polished brown boots shone from below the coat's hem. His Pour le Mérite was at his throat. He was to lead {{one of the two}} scheduled afternoon patrols. Leutnant Gustav Bellen was his righthand wingman; Leutnant Friedrich Rüdenberg had Voss's other side. After takeoff at 18:05 hours, Voss, with his new Fokker Triplane, advanced its throttle and soon outdistanced his two wingmen flying slower Pfalz D.IIIs. A few minutes later, Oberleutnant Ernst Weigand in Albatros D.V number 1187/17 led a second flight skyward; three Pfalz D.IIIs followed him, piloted by Leutnants Erich Löwenhardt, Alois Heldmann, and Max Kuhn. None of the Jasta 10 aircraft would ever <b>catch</b> <b>their</b> Staffelführer.|$|E

50|$|Flossers are anglers who use {{the method}} of bottom {{bouncing}} or lining to <b>catch</b> fish. <b>Their</b> <b>catch</b> is mainly from the salmon species.|$|R
50|$|Shell scrapes offer better {{concealment}} {{than traditional}} tarp bivouacs {{because the majority}} of the soldier's body mass is below ground level. This <b>catches</b> <b>their</b> body heat, making them harder to spot with thermal imagers.|$|R
5|$|The claw {{of a bird}} of prey; {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey {{would not be able}} to <b>catch</b> <b>their</b> food. Some birds also use claws for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people. All birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The hoatzin and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the thumb and index finger (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end of the hand digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.|$|E
5|$|The {{species can}} hunt singly, in pairs, and in groups, relying on sharp {{eyesight}} to locate prey. In some cases, supposed cooperative hunting may be incidental, {{a result of}} group members fishing individually in close proximity; truly coordinated hunting may only occur where the prey cannot be taken by a single giant otter, such as with small anacondas and juvenile black caiman. The giant otter seems to prefer prey fish that are generally immobile on river bottoms in clear water. Prey chase is rapid and tumultuous, with lunges and twists through the shallows and few missed targets. The otter can attack from both above and below, swiveling at the last instant to clamp the prey in its jaws. Giant otters <b>catch</b> <b>their</b> own food and consume it immediately; they grasp the fish firmly between the forepaws and begin eating noisily at the head. Carter and Rosas have found captive adult animals consume around 10% of their body weight daily—about , in keeping with findings in the wild.|$|E
5|$|The tiger {{salamander}} (Ambystoma tigrinum) {{is typical of}} the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates. Others amphibians, such as the Bufo spp. toads, actively search for prey, while the Argentine horned frog (Ceratophrys ornata) lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes. Among leaf litter frogs in Panama, frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim, often brightly coloured and toxic, while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well-camouflaged. Caecilians do not flick their tongues, but <b>catch</b> <b>their</b> prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward-pointing teeth. The struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow. The subdued prey is gulped down whole.|$|E
25|$|Peacock bass prey among {{anything}} that <b>catches</b> <b>their</b> eye but fish {{that they seem}} most interested in are tilapia, crayfish, tadpoles, mosquito fish, minnows and guppies. Also, they'll eat their own young when other fish are scarce.|$|R

5000|$|The Dragonlance {{campaign}} set has {{a completely}} different race that fills the niche usually held by halflings, known as kender. They are completely immune to fear, even if magically generated. Described as having a [...] "communal" [...] outlook on property ownership, they are known to wander off while still holding, looking at, or even after pocketing an item that <b>catches</b> <b>their</b> fancy. They do not consider this stealing, but rather only {{think of it as}} borrowing the item. Kender have a tendency to discard items for what they deem more valuable (what <b>catches</b> <b>their</b> eye more), at the time of acquiring a new item if they need more space in their pouches.|$|R
5|$|Typically diurnal, {{the jungle}} cat hunts {{throughout}} the day. Solitary in nature, jungle cats do not interact appreciably {{except in the}} mating season. The only prominent interaction is the mother-kitten bond. Territories are maintained by urine spraying and scent marking. The cat is primarily a carnivore, and prefers small mammals (gerbils, hares and rodents) and birds. It hunts by stalking its prey, followed by a sprint or a leap; the sharp ears help in pinpointing the location of prey. Both sexes become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year old; females enter oestrus from January to March. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by {{the nape of her neck}} and mounts her. Gestation lasts nearly two months. Births take place between December and June, though this might vary geographically. Kittens begin to <b>catch</b> <b>their</b> own prey at around six months and leave the mother after eight or nine months.|$|E
5|$|The {{coconut crab}} has a {{well-developed}} sense of smell, which it uses to locate its food. The process of smelling works very differently {{depending on whether}} the smelled molecules are hydrophilic molecules in water or hydrophobic molecules in air. As most crabs live in the water, they have specialised organs called s on their antennae to determine both the concentration and the direction of a smell. However, as coconut crabs live on the land, the aesthetascs on their antennae are shorter and blunter than those of other crabs and look more like those of insects. While insects and the coconut crab originate from different paths, the same need to detect smells in the air {{led to the development of}} remarkably similar organs. Coconut crabs flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception. They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect interesting odours over large distances. The smells of rotting meat, bananas, and coconuts, all potential food sources, <b>catch</b> <b>their</b> attention especially. Research has shown that the olfactory system in the coconut crab's brain is well-developed compared to other areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|In zoo exhibits, {{the colour}} pattern may seem garish, {{but in a}} shadowy jungle {{environment}} amid fallen leaves and debris, {{it allows them to}} virtually disappear. Called disruptive colouration, it protects them from predators and helps them to <b>catch</b> <b>their</b> prey.|$|E

25|$|U.S. {{fisheries}} use most {{fishing gear}} types. Vessels are often configured {{so they can}} change rapidly between two or more gear types, such as lobster pots to bottom trawls to scallop dredges. The main techniques are purse seining and trawling. Some vessels freeze <b>their</b> <b>catch</b> at sea, such as factory trawlers, tuna boats, Alaskan crab pot vessels, and some southeast shrimp trawlers. Vessels usually land <b>their</b> <b>catches</b> near <b>their</b> homeports.|$|R

25|$|Virginia {{big-eared bat}}s are insectivores. Insectivores are {{carnivores}} that predominantly eat insects. The Virginia big-eared bat has adapted to evening and dawn feeding times. They use {{this time to}} hunt airborne insects in wooded areas. Bats {{have a very strong}} sense of hearing, which allows them to quickly identify and <b>catch</b> <b>their</b> prey.|$|E
25|$|Hunting {{supplemented}} the Cucuteni-Trypillia diet. They used traps to <b>catch</b> <b>their</b> prey, as well {{as various}} weapons, including the bow and arrow, the spear and clubs. To help them in stalking game, they sometimes disguised themselves with camouflage. Remains of game species found at Cucuteni-Trypillia sites include red deer, roe deer, aurochs, wild boar, fox and brown bear.|$|E

25|$|Most of bus {{companies}} in Peninsular Malaysia provide air-conditioned express bus services. Tickets {{can be bought}} at bus terminals or ticket offices. All buses that arrive in Alor Setar stop at Shahab Perdana Terminal Bus, Alor Setar. Those who wish to travel to other towns, including Thailand, can <b>catch</b> <b>their</b> bus at this terminal. Local bus services are also available. They serve almost all towns in Kedah.|$|E
25|$|Although several {{witnesses}} came to {{the conclusion}} that the attacks could not be the work of dogs or coyotes because they had not eaten the victim, this conclusion is incorrect. Both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey, either because they are inexperienced, or due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey. The prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal bleeding or circulatory shock. The presence of two holes in the neck, corresponding with the canine teeth, are to be expected since this is the only way that most land carnivores have to <b>catch</b> <b>their</b> prey.|$|E
25|$|The {{triumph of}} the Australian team was mainly due to its {{aggressive}} captain Richie Benaud, now {{regarded as one of}} the greatest captains in Test cricket, who led what appeared to be an average team to five series victories in succession. The Australian fielding was outstanding, turning many a half-chance into a <b>catch.</b> <b>Their</b> opener Colin McDonald made 519 runs (64.67), the first batsman to exceed 500 runs in an Ashes series since Len Hutton in 1950–51. Benaud and Alan Davidson had previously underperformed against England, but now realised their full potential. Benaud took 31 wickets (18.83), the most by an Australian in an Ashes series since Monty Noble in 1901–02, and Davidson 24 wickets (19.00).|$|E

25|$|The {{border between}} Mystarria and Inkarra is a closed one, as some sixty years before, criminals and assassins crept across the border. Three such assassins were {{captured}} and executed outright, their bodies sent home as warning. Zandaros protested the executions and insulted the Mystarrians, {{and so a}} response was sent by skyrider that if the Inkarrans would not patrol the border and <b>catch</b> <b>their</b> own criminals, Mystarria could not be blamed for doing so themselves. Zandaros's own response to this message was to send the child skyrider's head back in a sack. Ever since, Rofehavanish from Mystarria have been forbidden to enter Inkarra on penalty of death, and Mystarria has forbidden any Inkarrans from ever entering the nation. Most other nations of Rofehavan tolerate Inkarran traders and traveling performers.|$|E
25|$|They were ram-feeding predators. They had rapid jaw {{movements}} and probably used snapping rather than chewing mechanisms to eat prey. The diet of Temnodontosaurus {{is not completely}} known but probably included squid like molluscs, fishes and marine reptiles. They probably fed on Plesiosaurs and other Ichthyosaurs too. A T. trigonodon fossil (from the Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde in Stuttgart) shows remains of Stenopterygius, an Ichthyosaur, in its abdominal cavity. According to McGowan T. eurycephalus had more robust teeth and a deeper jaw and therefore probably ate the larger prey such as other Ichthyosaurs, while species such as T. platyodon had pointed but modest sized teeth and therefore ate more soft-bodied prey and fish. They were powerful swimmers with great stamina and could descend into the deepest areas in the Jurassic sea to <b>catch</b> <b>their</b> prey.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the battle}} plan drawn up by Weyrother, the Austrians {{advanced}} west in four corps. From north to south they were Feldmarchall-Leutnant Michael von Kienmayer's Right Column (16,000), Feldmarchall-Leutnant Louis-Willibrord-Antoine Baillet de Latour's Right Center Column (10,800), Feldzeugmeister Johann Kollowrat's Left Center Column (20,000), and Feldmarchall-Leutnant Johann Sigismund Riesch's Left Column (13,300). The three southern columns marched near the main road from Haag to Hohenlinden. Meanwhile, Kienmayer followed the Isen River valley from Dorfen west to Lengdorf, then south to Isen, before approaching the Hohenlinden plain from the east. Archduke John rode with Kollowrat's force, which used the main east-west highway. Latour used trails just {{to the north of}} the highway, while Riesch followed tracks just to the south. Due to the densely forested terrain, bad roads, and poor staff work, the Austrian columns were not mutually supporting. Their commanders mistakenly thought the French were in retreat and were rushing to <b>catch</b> <b>their</b> enemies before they could escape.|$|E
50|$|The legend {{goes that}} some {{fishermen}} {{made a good}} catch and ate the fish around their campfire. The fishermen, however, did not share <b>their</b> <b>catch</b> with <b>their</b> dogs, despite having {{more than enough to}} eat. As a punishment, the women, who were guardians of social law, turned the greedy men to stone.|$|R
50|$|Blue catfish are {{opportunistic}} {{predators and}} eat any {{species of fish}} they can catch, along with crawfish, freshwater mussels, frogs, and other readily available aquatic food sources. <b>Catching</b> <b>their</b> prey becomes all the more easy if it is already wounded or dead, and blue catfish are noted for feeding beneath marauding schools of striped bass in open water in reservoirs or feeding on wounded baitfish that have been washed through dam spillways or power-generation turbines.|$|R
60|$|The {{ordinary}} or unobservant person sees {{and hears}} far {{more of the}} jackdaw than of any other bird in Bath. Daws are seen and heard all over the town, but are most common about the Abbey, where they soar and gambol and quarrel all day long, and when they think that nobody is looking, drop down {{to the streets to}} snatch up and carry off any eatable-looking object that <b>catches</b> <b>their</b> eye.|$|R
