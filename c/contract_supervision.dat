40|$|In agriculture, the {{coexistence}} of {{different forms of}} land tenancy or labour contract has been explained so far by several theories related to Marshallian inefficiency, incentives, risk sharing, and transaction costs, including supervision costs. These theories and the empirical evidences have greatly contributed to explain the reasons behind land tenancy or labour contract choice. This study follows up on this. Moreover, it intends to take a further step by focusing particularly on the production technologies at plot level, and by designing and testing a theoretical model based on household profit optimization. This model will {{take into account the}} supervision costs of labour (i) to compare optimum profit derived from plots based on household labour, a sharecropping labour contract, and a wage labour contract, controlling for irrigation equipment (ii) to test the efficiency of the labour contract choice using data from Senegal’s horticultural zone. As expected, the production elasticity of labour decreases when improved irrigation equipment like a motor pump is used. The technology displays an increasing return to scale on plots without a motor pump and a constant return to scale on plots irrigated with a motor pump. While on plots without a motor pump the sharecropping contract is the efficient labour contract choice, leading to a higher optimum profit for the household, on plots irrigated with a motor pump, the wage contract is the best labour contract choice. Consequently, we can conclude from this finding that the use of a motor pump drives out the sharecropping contract in favour of household labour and the wage labour contract. land tenancy, labour, sharecropping, wage, <b>contract,</b> <b>supervision,</b> household, profit optimization, efficient, irrigation equipment, horticulture, Senegal, Agricultural Finance,...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1986 The Economic Contract Law of the People's Republic of China {{expresses the}} regime's {{willingness}} to extend to economic actors limited private economic {{rights under the}} new economic reform policies. The emergence of private economic rights has significance both for its potential effect on economic growth and for its long term impact on the political authority {{of the state in}} post-Mao China. In order for the law to stimulate the emergence of private economic rights, however, it must be accepted by economic actors as a basis for economic transactions. Thus, it must achieve legitimacy. The legitimacy sought must include both abstract and practical legitimacy such that the rules set forth by the doctrine of the law are accepted as valid conceptually and relied upon operationally by economic actors. Tentative conclusions as to the potential for the Economic Contract Law and its related regulations to achieve legitimacy in China may be reached by examining the doctrine and practice of the law {{in the context of the}} pre-existing norms with which the law competes for acceptance. Doctrinal pronouncements by political leadership groups and legal communities in China reveal consensus and divergence on the issues of the function of contracts and contract law, the nature of <b>contract</b> <b>supervision,</b> and the character of dispute settlement and sanctions for non-performance. The interplay between such consensus and divergence suggests that the doctrine of the law will attain abstract legitimacy. However, the application of the law in specific disputes has revealed obstacles to the acquisition of practical legitimacy. Political and economic factors have rendered contract performance problematic while continued reluctance to impose monetary penalties for non-performance has impeded the reliability of contracts. Nonetheless, popular dissemination of contract rules recognizing the rights of contracting parties together with the establishment of institutions to enforce such rights represent a foundation on which the practical legitimacy of the law may be built. Thus, while obstacles remain, an important foundation has been established for the full legitimation of the Economic Contract Law and for the further emergence of private economic rights in China...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{title is}} Supervision as a Form of Support in the Helping Professions. The {{translation}} of the term of supervision is an insight or inspection into a particular problem. Unfortunately, there are still facilities in which supervision is rather considered as inspection. Currently, there {{is an effort to}} prove the usefulness of supervision. To the introduction of supervision as part of good practice for workers in helping professions contributes the document issued by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs ?Quality Standards for Social Care Services". Especially in helping professions, this topic is an up-to-date subject and supervision is becoming an integral part of functioning of many institutions. In the theoretical section the basic terms such as stress and burnout in helping professions, supervision, its forms, goals and tools are defined. It deals with the <b>supervision</b> process, <b>supervision</b> <b>contract</b> and quality standards for social care services. The practical part consists of a qualitative research. The research was conducted in five organizations in České Budějovice. The information collection was carried out using interrogation techniques, semi-structured interviews with supervised workers, supervisors, and <b>supervision</b> <b>contracting</b> authorities. The objective of the thesis was to identify whether the supervised persons consider supervision to have a supportive or another function. The data were compiled into case reports and the common points compared. The research has found that supervision does provide most respondents with some kind of support. In addition to its supporting function, supervision is seen as having an educational function. The research results document views of supervised persons on supervision, which may be beneficial for contracting authorities, supervisors and the whole organizations.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{principal}}-agent {{model with a}} moral hazard problem in which the principal has access to a hard signal (the level of output) and a soft signal (the supervision signal) about the agent?s level of effort. We show that the agent?'s ability to manipulate the soft signal increases the cost of implementing the effcient equilibrium, leading to wage compression when the infl?uence cost is privately incurred by the agent. When manipulation activities negatively affect the agent?s productivity through the level of output, the design of infl?uence-free contracts that deter manipulation may lead to high-powered incentives. This result implies that high-productivity workers face incentive schemes that are more sensitive to hard evidence than those faced by their low-productivity counterparts. In that context, the principal will tolerate infl?uence for low-productivity workers but not for high-productivity workers. We also fi?nd {{that in the case}} of productivity-based costs, it may be optimal for the principal not to supervise the agent, even if supervision is costless. principal-agent model with <b>supervision,</b> <b>contract</b> design, in?uence activities, manipulation, productivity-based influence costs, power of incentives...|$|R

Personally, I am not going to take a stance in favour of the new designation, but I can state that the former term “Construcciones Arquitectónicas” (literally, Architectural Constructions”) no longer adequately reflects what we are currently teaching and researching at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC). Our university department teaches the traditional contents of materials, construction systems (building envelopes and cladding) andthe design and calculation of structures, but it also teaches the design and calculation of services (water, gas and electricity) and fittings(heating and air conditioning, lighting, sound, sanitary fittings, safety, etc.), using both active and passive systems, as well as aspects relating to the management of architecture (<b>contracting,</b> evaluation, <b>supervision,</b> logistics andmaintenance, among other aspects).
