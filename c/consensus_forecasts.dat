40|$|Abstract We utilize new {{income tax}} reserve {{disclosures}} required under FIN 48 {{to examine whether}} managers use discretion over this accrual to manage earnings to meet the <b>consensus</b> analyst <b>forecast.</b> We find that firms with pre-managed earnings (i. e., earnings before {{the change in the}} tax reserve) that are below the <b>consensus</b> analyst <b>forecast</b> {{are far more likely to}} reduce their tax reserves and thus report higher net income. In fact, we find that 37 percent of firm-years with pre-managed earnings below the <b>consensus</b> <b>forecast</b> meet the forecast when the change in the tax reserve is included in earnings. In contrast, only 9. 8 percent of firm-years with pre-managed earnings above the <b>consensus</b> <b>forecast</b> increased their tax reserves to the extent that it caused them to miss the <b>consensus</b> <b>forecast.</b> This asymmetric result is consistent with managers using their discretion over tax reserves to meet <b>consensus</b> analyst <b>forecasts.</b> Using a proxy for changes in tax reserves developed by Blouin and Tuna (2007), we also document a decline in the use of tax reserves to meet the <b>consensus</b> analyst <b>forecast</b> following the adoption of FIN 48. Nonetheless, our results using both estimated and actual changes in tax reserves clearly suggest that managers continue to use their discretion over this account to meet the consensus analys...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Operational use of <b>consensus</b> track <b>forecasting</b> methods {{has become}} {{relatively}} {{widespread in the}} last four years. This paper gives an overview of current <b>consensus</b> track <b>forecasting</b> methods, summarises recent research regarding <b>consensus</b> track <b>forecasting</b> methods, and looks at implementation challenges faced by operational centers. We consider the relative merits and degree of operational use of single-model and multi-model ensembles, weighted and non-weighted consensus methods, selective and non-selective methods and use of a vector motion average in place of a geographical position average. The theoretical basis for optimising <b>consensus</b> <b>forecast</b> skill is considered in relation to operational issues that may create roadblocks to realising that skill. A number of recommendations are made to improve uptake of consensus methods amongst operational centers, particularly those with fewer resources, and to optimise track forecasting skill in operational centers already using consensus methods. The benefits of <b>consensus</b> <b>forecasting</b> have long been recognised by the meteorological community (Sanders 1973, Thompson 1977). A general subjective form of <b>consensus</b> track <b>forecasting</b> has been in widespread use ever since multiple forms of forecast track guidance have been available to forecasters...|$|R

40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} quality of an average or <b>consensus</b> <b>forecast</b> for {{economic}} growth in Belgium. A quarterly series of current and one-year-ahead growth forecasts is constructed as the average of forecasts published by Belgian institutions. In similar foreign studies a fixed number of forecasts is considered since a forecaster is only included if he published forecasts in every quarter of the sample; we do not take this restrictive view but calculated the average of all forecasts made available in any quarter. The <b>consensus</b> growth <b>forecasts</b> will be evaluated graphically, statistically and econometrically. The conclusion is that the Belgian <b>consensus</b> <b>forecast</b> is rather good, although some efficiency tests are not passed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

The results provide little evidence of a strong link between observed heteroskedasticity in the <b>consensus</b> <b>forecast</b> errors and forecast uncertainty. Instead, the findings indicate a significant link between observed heteroskedasticity in the <b>consensus</b> <b>forecast</b> errors and forecast dispersion. We conclude that conventional model-based measures of uncertainty may be capturing not the degree of confidence that individuals attach to their forecasts but rather the degree of disagreement across individuals in their forecasts.
