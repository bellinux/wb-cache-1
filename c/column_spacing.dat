5000|$|There {{were two}} main methods for setting out the floor {{plan of the}} minka. The kyoma (...) method uses a {{standard}} size of tatami (...) mat, whereas the inakama (...) method is based upon <b>column</b> <b>spacing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The beamway is an {{advanced}} torsion resistant macro-cellular constructional assembly achieving longitudinal structural continuity with a patented junction between consecutive beam modules. The assembly delivers entirely accurate constructional alignment overcoming any variations in fabrication tolerances and longitudinal and torsional structural continuity {{at the same}} time as allowing longitudinal expansion and contraction through environmental temperature ranges. This continual beamway structure breaks free from the need of regular <b>column</b> <b>spacing,</b> this escaping the [...] "post and lintel" [...] characteristic common to all other beam carried transit structures. A permissible span of up to 33 metres under dynamic loading allows for optimising the spacing between columns for convenient ground positioning to avoid foundations clashing with sub-ground services. The design flexibility of irregular <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> minimises visual impact and obtrusive collisions of the column footprint with existing urban features on the ground minimising the need for costly relocations whether it be a telephone box or an important data carrying fibre optic cable.|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Jure Radić, and built by Konstruktor, Split, between 1993 and 1996, using free cantilevering with temporary cable-stays. The reinforced-concrete arch was executed in 5 m long segments, matching spandrel <b>column</b> <b>spacing.</b> Prefabricated girders required for the structure were executed and prestressed in a purpose built plant on the site. The same plant was subsequently used to produce Jersey barriers used as bridge protective barriers.|$|E
50|$|The {{two towers}} at Washington Square are {{constructed}} of steel reinforced concrete and {{are classified as}} “Type I Construction”. Each tower is 24-stories to ensure slab thicknesses and columns spacing at efficiencies that match the seismic and wind loading in the Northwest. By post-tensioning the tower floor slabs the weight is reduced and the greater <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> offers unit layouts with greater circulation and exterior views than if the columns were closer together.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the next}} thirty years, the factory {{expanded}} three times. In 1935, an addition along Hollins Street virtually duplicated the 1920 addition. The 1983 addition on Boyd Street {{was similar to}} the earlier additions, but lacked the ceramic block insignia ornamentation and expansive <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> of the earlier building. In 1948, an office and warehouse addition departed form the earlier design. This addition was announced in the July 1948 edition of Baltimore Magazine.|$|E
50|$|In linear algebra, the <b>column</b> <b>space</b> (also {{called the}} range or image) of a matrix A is the span (set of all {{possible}} linear combinations) of its column vectors. The <b>column</b> <b>space</b> of a matrix is the image or range of the corresponding matrix transformation.|$|R
50|$|The set of all row vectors forms a {{vector space}} called row space, {{similarly}} {{the set of}} all column vectors forms a vector <b>space</b> called <b>column</b> <b>space.</b> The dimensions of the row and <b>column</b> <b>spaces</b> equals the number of entries in the row or column vector.|$|R
50|$|The set of {{all such}} vectors is the <b>column</b> <b>space</b> of A. In this case, the <b>column</b> <b>space</b> is {{precisely}} the set of vectors (x, y, z) &isin; R3 satisfying the equation z = 2x (using Cartesian coordinates, this set is a plane through the origin in three-dimensional space).|$|R
5000|$|The Technical Division had {{departments}} that designed the projects which included electrical, plumbing, heating and air-conditioning.This division {{was responsible for}} the functional design of the building. Key important design elements for factories included [...] "straight-line" [...] production capability, flexibility in interior floor designs to accommodate various changing production methods, generous <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> to give maximum open floor space, high ceilings, strong floors to carry heavy loads, and with good lighting and ventilation.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} structure, metopes may be carved {{from a single}} block with a triglyph (or triglyphs), {{or they may be}} cut {{separately}} and slide into slots in the triglyph blocks as at the Temple of Aphaea. Sometimes the metopes and friezes were cut from different stone, so as to provide color contrast. Although they tend to be close to square in shape, some metopes are noticeably larger in height or in width. They may also vary in width within a single structure to allow for corner contraction, an adjustment of the <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> and arrangement of the Doric frieze in a temple to make the design appear more harmonious.|$|E
50|$|This {{produces}} {{a basis for}} the <b>column</b> <b>space</b> that is a subset of the original column vectors. It works because the columns with pivots are {{a basis for the}} <b>column</b> <b>space</b> of the echelon form, and row reduction does not change the linear dependence relationships between the columns.|$|R
5000|$|Now, each [...] is {{obviously}} a vector in the <b>column</b> <b>space</b> of A. So, [...] {{is a set of}} r linearly independent vectors in the <b>column</b> <b>space</b> of A and, hence, the dimension of the <b>column</b> <b>space</b> of A (i.e., the column rank of A) must be at least as big as r. This proves that row rank of A is no larger than the column rank of A. Now apply this result to the transpose of A to get the reverse inequality and conclude as in the previous proof.|$|R

50|$|In {{terms of}} structure, a triglyph may be carved {{from a single}} block with a metope, or the triglyph block may have slots cut into it to allow a {{separately}} cut metope (in stone or wood) to be slid into place, as at the Temple of Aphaea. Of {{the two groups of}} 6th-century metopes from Foce del Sele, now in the museum at Paestum, the earlier uses the first method, the later the second. There may be some variation in design within a single structure to allow for corner contraction, an adjustment of the <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> and arrangement of the Doric frieze in a temple to make the design appear more harmonious. In the evolution of the Doric order, the placing of the triglyphs evolved somewhat, especially at corners.|$|E
50|$|Stations can be double-span with {{a single}} row of columns, triple-span with two rows of columns, or multi-span. The typical shallow column station in Russia is triple-span, {{assembled}} from concrete and steel, and is from 102 to 164 metres in length with a <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> of 4-6 m. Along with the typical stations, there are also specially built stations. For example, one of the spans may be replaced with a monolithic vault (as in the Moskovskaya station of the Samara Metro or Sibirskaya in Novosibirsk). In some cases, one of the rows of columns may be replaced with a load-bearing wall. Such a dual hall, one-span station, Kashirskaya, was constructed to provide a convenient cross-platform transfer. Recently, stations have appeared with monolithic concrete and steel instead of assembled pieces, as Ploshchad Tukaya in Kazan.|$|E
50|$|On 19 April 1995, the nine-story {{concrete}} framed Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma {{was struck}} by a huge car bomb causing partial collapse, resulting in the deaths of 168 people. The bomb, though large, caused a significantly disproportionate collapse of the structure. The bomb blew all the glass off the front of the building and completely shattered a ground floor reinforced concrete column (see brisance). At second story level a wider <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> existed, and loads from upper story columns were transferred into fewer columns below by girders at second floor level. The removal of one of the lower story columns caused neighbouring columns to fail due to the extra load, eventually leading to the complete collapse of the central portion of the building. The bombing {{was one of the first}} to highlight the extreme forces that blast loading from terrorism can exert on buildings, and led to increased consideration of terrorism in structural design of buildings.|$|E

50|$|The {{southern}} bridge ramp begins {{behind its}} junction with the Stralsund ring road (the B 96 federal road) and consists, of an 85.53-metre-long embankment structure, measured to the abutment {{of the first}} approach bridge. Beyond it are the two Stralsund approach bridges (Vorlandbrücken Stralsund) with gradients of up to 4%. The first, structure BW 1.1, is 327.5-metre-long bridge made of pre-stressed concrete with ten sections and a twin prestressed beam slab girder as the superstructure. BW 1.2 is a 317.0-metre-long bridge with six sections and a single-cell steel composite superstructure that was manufactureed by the steelworks in Neumarkt-Sengenthal. An architectural feature is the B 96 approach road section with its two pairs of Y-supports, which enable the large <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> of 72 metres at constant height. The railings of the approach bridges have 0.70-metre-high inside walls with laminated safety glass panels as wind deflectors and spray shields. The structures are founded on driven concrete piles cast in-situ.|$|E
30|$|Figure  4 b {{shows the}} {{estimated}} maximum storage pressure (Pmax) vs. {{the number of}} stories for different <b>column</b> <b>spacing,</b> in which the inner diameters for the pile (di) was set to be 300  mm for all the cases. As mentioned previously, the maximum storage pressures (Pmax) were calculated using the energy demand pattern 4. The building with more number of stories and larger <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> have more energy consumption, which results in more energy demands for the storage (win) to keep the total energy demand and supply equal for the 24  h period. However, at the same time, the taller building and larger <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> requires more number of piles and longer pile length, which consequently results in more available storage volume (V). Therefore, as shown in Fig.  4 b, {{it appeared that the}} maximum storage pressure (Pmax) is not sensitive depending on the number of stories and <b>column</b> <b>spacing.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a new combinatorial approach towards constructing a sparse, implicit {{basis for the}} null space of a sparse, under-determined matrix. Our approach is to compute a <b>column</b> <b>space</b> basis of that has a sparse inverse, {{which could be used}} to represent a null space basis in implicit form. We investigate three different algorithms for computing <b>column</b> <b>space</b> bases: two greedy algorithms implemented using graph matchings, and a third, which employs a divide and conquer strategy implemented with hypergraph partitioning followed by a matching. Our results show that for many matrices from linear programming, structural analysis, and circuit simulation, it is possible to compute <b>column</b> <b>space</b> bases having sparse inverses, contrary to conventional wisdom. The hypergraph partitioning method yields sparser basis inverses and has low computational time requirements, relative to the greedy approaches. We also discuss the complexity of selecting a <b>column</b> <b>space</b> basis when it is known that such a basis exists in block diagonal form with a given small block size.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse a space frame-raft-soil system under static load to understand the influence of <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> on the behavior of a soil-raft and frame. In the analysis, all three components space frame, raft and soil were considered as a single compatible unit. The analyses are carried out for linear and non-linear conditions, in which soil is treated as a homogeneous and isotropic continuum. The analyses are carried out by ANSYS finite element code. The results of four different column spacings are compared and the influence of the <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> on settlement, the bending moment and contact pressure are studied. The settlement increases considerably with increases in <b>column</b> <b>spacing.</b> The column spacings resulted in the rafts of the two raft types rigid raft and flexible raft according to the bending moment in the raft. The <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> has a marginal effect on the contact pressure. The results of two different raft thicknesses are compared and the influence of the raft thickness on settlement, the bending moment and contact pressure are also studied. The increase in raft thickness resulted in reduced settlement, an increased bending moment and reduced uniform contact pressure. The results of two soils with different Young’s modulus are compared and the influence of Young’s modulus on settlement bending moment and contact pressure is also studied...|$|E
30|$|It {{would also}} be very {{interesting}} to compare the variance of column spacings in real maps (in units of the spacing evaluated by averaging local periods) with the smallest possible value for GRFs, observed in this paper for monochromatic fields (see Fig.  4); if a lower value for variance in real maps than in monochromatic Gaussian fields is found, it would mean that cortical circuitry refinement, featuring long-range interactions, brings mature maps closer to a geometrical homogeneity of hypercolumns. This would also throw some light on the fact that as development proceeds and the probability distribution of the field turns away from that of a GRF, driven by activity-dependent shaping, the <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> obtained by averaging local periods seems to come closer to the wavelength associated to the mean or peak wavenumber (see [9, supplementary material, p. 5]) than it is in GRFs. It is then remarkable that development should maintain the value of π for pinwheel density when scaled with respect to the current value of <b>column</b> <b>spacing,</b> keeping Result 2 valid over time (of course the density seems to move if one does not change the definition of <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> over time, but the best-suited quantity for measuring <b>column</b> <b>spacing</b> seems to change). Perhaps this also has a benefit for areas receiving inputs from V 1, keeping their tuning with the pinwheel subsystem (which seems to have an independent interest for information processing; see [45]) stable.|$|E
