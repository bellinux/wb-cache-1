50|$|The Royal Canadian Mint {{has made}} coins with various themes. Most recently, ice hockey {{has been used}} for many numismatic releases. The first known ice hockey coin was for the 1988 Winter Olympics. Issued on February 25, 1986, the coin {{featured}} a goalie on the <b>coin.</b> <b>Edge</b> lettering was also used for the coin, the first time that it was used on silver coins.|$|R

25|$|The 1p, 2p, 20p and 50p <b>coins</b> have smooth <b>edges.</b> The 5p, 10p, £1 and £2 <b>coins</b> have milled <b>edges.</b> The milling, in {{combination}} with the non-circular shape of the 20p and 50p, serve as the primary means of identification and differentiation between coinage for blind or visually impaired people. Historically, milling also served to discourage coin clipping.|$|R

500|$|The cartwheel twopenny coin was not struck again; {{much of the}} mintage was {{melted down}} in 1800 {{when the price of}} copper {{increased}} and it had proved too heavy for commerce and was difficult to strike. [...] Much to Boulton's chagrin, the new coins were being counterfeited in copper-covered lead within a month of issuance. [...] Boulton was awarded additional contracts in 1799 and 1806, each for the lower three copper denominations. [...] Though the cartwheel design was used again for the 1799 penny (struck with the date 1797), all other strikings used lighter planchets to reflect the rise in the price of copper, and featured more conventional designs. [...] Boulton greatly reduced the counterfeiting problem by adding lines to the <b>coin</b> <b>edges,</b> and striking slightly concave planchets. [...] Counterfeiters turned their sights to easier targets, the pre-Soho pieces, which were not withdrawn, due to the expense, until a gradual withdrawal took place between 1814 and 1817.|$|R

2500|$|In the reigns of Kings Edward VII, George V, (Edward VIII), and George VI, five pound coins {{were only}} issued in proof sets {{in the first}} year of their reign (only {{prepared}} for approval in the case of Edward VIII, which is why his coin is valued at around £175,000!). All these reigns used the Pistrucci George and Dragon obverse, with the 1902 and 1911 <b>coins</b> having milled <b>edges,</b> though at least some of the 1937 <b>coins</b> have plain <b>edges.</b> The 1902 Edward VII coin was also minted at Sydney, being identified by an [...] "S" [...] above the centre of the date.|$|R

25|$|In 1857, when Nicholas and all men {{involved}} in pressing the Constantine rouble were already dead, general Fyodor Schubert (1789–1865) {{broke the silence}} and published {{a brief description of}} a Constantine ruble from his private collection. Schubert wrote that his coin was a test sample that was sent to Constantine's approval during the interregnum, and that press dies were destroyed upon accession of Nicholas I.

50|$|Castaing {{introduced}} other ideas, {{including the}} reforming and recoining of already existing French <b>coins</b> with <b>edge</b> lettering to reduce instances of counterfeiting and {{raise money for}} King Louis XIV's efforts in the Nine Years' War. During the carrying out of one such operation, Castaing was accused of malversation. His wife, Marie Hippolyte Castaing (née Bosch) petitioned the court on his behalf, and he was freed two years later. He died {{at some point in}} the early eighteenth century.|$|R
5000|$|In numismatics, reeded {{edges are}} often {{referred}} to as [...] "ridged" [...] or [...] "grooved" [...] (US usage), or [...] "milled" [...] (UK usage). Some coins, such as United States quarters and dimes, 1 euro, Australian 5, 10, 20 cents, 1 and 2 dollars, as well many other current <b>coins,</b> have reeded <b>edges.</b> One reason for having reeded edges was to prevent counterfeiting. Some gold and silver coins were reeded to discourage scraping off the precious metals from the <b>edge</b> of the <b>coin,</b> to maintain its stated value in precious metal. [...] Another benefit of certain <b>coins</b> having reeded <b>edges</b> is that it helps enable different coin denominations to be easily identified and distinguished from each other by sense of touch alone.|$|R
50|$|The coin was {{the largest}} Irish coin since decimalisation: its {{diameter}} was 3.11 cm and its mass was 10 g. The coin was almost identical in dimensions to the old penny coin that circulated until 1971, and was similar in diameter to, but thinner than, the half-crown <b>coin.</b> The <b>edge</b> was milled, and a dotted line ran {{along the edge of}} each face. Unlike some previous Irish coins, it was very different from its British equivalent, as the Irish pound separated from the British pound in 1979.|$|R
5000|$|Jean Castaing (...) was a French {{engineer}} and {{inventor of the}} Castaing machine, a device used to add <b>edge</b> lettering to <b>coins.</b> Though <b>edge</b> lettering had existed for over a century, the earliest methods were costly and time-consuming. In 1649, Peter Blondeau introduced a new method at the Royal Mint in England, which he kept secret. Later, in 1685, Castaing proposed that his machine {{be used in the}} mints of France. His proposal was approved, and Castaing later became general manager of all the mints in the nation.|$|R
5000|$|Since February 1, 2008, a 1-ounce silver {{version of}} the coin with a nominal value of €1.50 has been issued, struck from 99.9% pure silver. Unlike the reeded edge of the gold <b>coin,</b> the <b>edge</b> of the silver coin is smooth. Coins are shipped in boxes of 500, called [...] "monster boxes." [...] Each monster box {{consists}} of 25 tubes of 20 coins each. Sales of the silver Philharmonic have been brisk with over five million coins sold, equal to 1,800 tons of silver in the 5-year period of 2008 through 2012.|$|R
