40|$|The {{objective}} of the dissertation was to develop an intrinsic UV and luminescence cure monitoring technique and to provide insight in understanding the cure chemistry of polycyanate resins. UV-visible spectrum of a bisphenol A dicyanate ester (BPADCY) monomer during the <b>cure</b> <b>reaction</b> supported that the cyclotrimerization of cyanate esters to form triazine rings is the principal reaction. ^ A very strong luminescence emission was found during the <b>cure</b> <b>reaction</b> of BPADCY monomer. As the <b>cure</b> <b>reaction</b> proceeded, the fluorescence emission intensity around 420 nm first increased and then decreased accompanied by a small bathochromic shift. Eleven cure related model compounds representing reactants, intermediates and products were chosen, and their UV-Visible and fluorescence behaviors were characterized in solution and in the solid state. Fluorescence behavior during cyclotrimerization of a monofunctional cyanate ester was also characterized. The model compound study indicated that the aromatic substituted triazines formed during the <b>cure</b> <b>reaction</b> and their inner filter effect {{were responsible for the}} emission around 420 nm and the observed trend in intensity. Fluorescence emission intensity of polycyanate resins heavily depended upon the measurement temperatures. Both bisphenol A as an impurity in monomer and cobalt acetylacetonate/nonyl phenol catalysts did not interfere with the emission at 420 nm. In situ fluorescence characterization was attempted for the <b>cure</b> <b>reaction</b> of cobalt acetylacetonate/nonyl phenol catalyzed BPADCY system. The phosphorescence emission wavelength of polycyanate resins appeared at about 20 nm longer than that of fluorescence.

5000|$|Condensation curing {{systems can}} be one-part or two-part systems. [...] In one-part or RTV (room-temperature vulcanizing) system, a {{cross-linker}} exposed to ambient humidity (i.e., water) experiences a hydrolysis step and is left with a hydroxyl or silanol group. The silanol condenses further with another hydrolyzable group on the polymer or cross-linker and continues until the system is fully cured. Such a system will cure on its own at room temperature and (unlike the platinum-based addition cure system) is not easily inhibited by contact with other chemicals, though the process may be affected by contact with some plastics or metals and may not take place at all if placed in contact with already-cured silicone compounds. The crosslinkers used in condensation cure systems are typically alkoxy, acetoxy or oxime silanes such as methyl trimethoxy silane for alkoxy-curing systems and methyl triacetoxysilane for acetoxy-curing systems. In many cases an additional condensation catalyst is added to fully cure the RTV system and achieve a tack-free surface. Organotitanate catalysts such as tetraalkoxy titanates or chelated titanates are used in alkoxy-cured systems. Tin catalysts such as dibutyl tin dilaurate (DBTDL) {{can be used in}} oxime and acetoxy-cured systems. Acetoxy tin condensation {{is one of the oldest}} cure chemistries used for curing silicone rubber, and is the one used in household bathroom caulk. The smell of vinegar in the form of acetic acid is the usual indicator that the <b>curing</b> <b>reaction</b> is taking place. Non-acid-producing formulations also exist which have a shorter shelf-life, however, and reduced adhesion when finally cured. [...] Two-part condensation systems package the cross-linker and condensation catalyst together in one part while the polymer and any fillers or pigments are in the second part. Mixing of the two parts causes the curing to take place.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDifferential {{scanning}} calorimetry (DSC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} used methods for kinetic studies of thermoset <b>cure</b> <b>reactions.</b> The basic assumption made in this technique is the proportionality between the heat generation rate and <b>cure</b> <b>reaction</b> rate. To have access to the heat generation rate that provides information about reaction kinetics, one must know the baseline under the measured curve.

The influence of changes in the sample's heat capacity is rarely taken into consideration. The use of data obtained with this type of baseline to determine kinetic parameters can lead to significant errors.

This means, there are more hydroxyl groups available from the binder (HTPB) than isocyanate groups from the curing agent are present in the mix.

The knowledge of the <b>curing</b> <b>reaction</b> kinetics is important for ageing studies, for the assumptions of the stress-free temperature value and not at least for assessing the post-curing reaction. The value of stress-free temperature is also influenced by ageing effects.
