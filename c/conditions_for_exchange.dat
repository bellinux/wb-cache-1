Since online transactions involve many uncertainties for the customer, trust is a <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> <b>exchange.</b> Trust in the electronic medium – here called “e‐trust” – is believed to increase online customer loyalty, but empirical confirmations are scarce. The present study empirically investigates the roles of service quality, satisfaction and trust in an e‐commerce context. In the study, e‐trust is found to directly affect loyalty. The e‐service quality dimension of assurance, i. e. trusting the merchant, influences loyalty via e‐trust and e‐satisfaction. Other e‐quality dimensions, such as ease of use, e‐scape, responsiveness, and customization influence e‐loyalty mainly indirectly, via satisfaction.

40|$|The {{exchange}} of lipid molecules between vesicle bilayers {{in water and}} a monolayer forming at the water surface was investigated theoretically {{within the framework of}} thermodynamics. The total number of exchanged molecules was found to depend on the bilayer curvature as expressed by the vesicle radius and on the boundary condition for exchange, i. e., whether during exchange the radius or the packing density of the vesicles remains constant. The boundary condition is determined by the rate of flip-flop within the bilayer relative to the rate of exchange between bi- and monolayer. If flip-flop is fast, exchange is independent of the vesicle radius; if flip-flop is slow, exchange increases with the vesicle radius. Available experimental results agree with the detailed form of this dependence. When the theory was extended to exchange between two bilayers of different curvature, the direction of exchange was also determined by the curvatures and the boundary <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>exchange.</b> Due to the dependence of the boundary conditions on flip-flop and, consequently, on membrane fluidity, exchange between membranes may partially be regulated by membrane fluidity...|$|E

40|$|Trust is an {{essential}} <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> <b>exchange.</b> Large societies must substitute the trust traditionally provided through kinship and sanctions in small groups to make exchange possible. The rise of internet-supported reputation systems has been celebrated for providing trust at a global scale, enabling the massive volumes of transactions between distant strangers that are characteristic of modern human societies. Here we problematize an overlooked side-effect of reputation systems: Equally trustworthy individuals may realize highly unequal exchange volumes. We report {{the results of a}} laboratory experiment that shows emergent differentiation between ex ante equivalent individuals when information on performance in past exchanges is shared. This arbitrary inequality results from cumulative advantage in the reputation-building process: Random initial distinctions grow as parties of good repute are chosen over those lacking a reputation. We conjecture that reputation systems produce artificial concentration {{in a wide range of}} markets and leave superior but untried exchange alternatives unexploited...|$|R
40|$|Exchange rate {{variability}} {{is claimed}} to have adverse effects on foreign trade. We focus on exchange rate variability over long periods, which may affect trade through either uncertainty or political economy channels. Previous theoretical {{studies have found that}} the trade effects of uncertainty may be negative or positive. We argue that the trade outcome of political economy effects is likewise indeterminate. Accordingly, empirical investigation is necessary to determine the trade effects of exchange rate variability. We conduct two studies of trade amongst developed market economies and find that long-run exchange rate variability reduces both the level and growth of trade. However, our results also suggest that trade benefits not only from reduced variability but also from institutionalized regime shift from floating to fixed exchange rates and on to a single currency. In addition, we find that: 1. political economy effects are not a necessary <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> <b>exchange</b> rate variability to depress trade; 2. uncertainty effects are a sufficient <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> this result; and 3. dynamic trade effects come from adjustment to EU membership rather than from membership as such. ...|$|R
