Building on experience gained with the ACTPol detector arrays, AdvACT will utilize various new technologies, including 150 mm detector wafers equipped with multichroic pixels, allowing for a more densely packed focal plane. Each set of detectors includes a feedhorn array of stacked silicon wafers which form a spline profile leading to each pixel. This is then followed by a waveguide interface plate, detector wafer, back short <b>cavity</b> <b>plate,</b> and backshort cap. Each array is housed in a custom designed structure manufactured from high purity copper and then gold plated. In addition to the detector array assembly, the array package also encloses cryogenic readout electronics. We present the full mechanical design of the AdvACT high frequency (HF) detector array package along with a detailed look at the detector array stack assemblies. This experiment will also make use of extensive hardware and software previously developed for ACT, which will be modified to incorporate the new AdvACT instruments.

Ear tubes are medical devices, which allow ventilation and provide pressure equalization in the middle ear cavity for prolonged period of time; in case of repetitive inflammation. These implants are normally made from metals or classical polymeric materials. Whereas, today, the effort is to develop bioresorbable tubes based on polylactic acid, which could replace currently used material. The benefit provides no requirement of secondary surgery for their removal. The size of ear implants is only in millimetres and the tool for their manufacturing requires a special technology.

It is normally impossible to remove it especially when certain parts {{have a number of}} holes or there is a material entering into cavity through more than one gate. Therefore many researches and publications were made on this topic purposely to learn the behavior of weld line occurred on molded parts particularly on plastic parts. In this study, a plastic product is decided to be a subject of analysis. The part is a thin plate with two holes and two cavities by using edge gate. Thermoplastic Polycarbonate/Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (PC/ABS) is used as a plastic material. Taguchi Method is applied in identifying the optimum value of injection molding parameters and Moldflow Plastic Insight software is used to simulate the injection molding process. The temperature differences on core and <b>cavity</b> <b>plates</b> are considered in simulation and the experimental shows that instead of melting temperature, temperature differences on mold also can help to minimize the length of weld line.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a European Commission sponsored activity, an overall assessment of the deterministic safety technology of the ‘post- Chernobyl modernized’ Reactor Bolshoy Moshchnosty Kipyashiy (RBMK) has been completed. The accident analysis, limited to the area of design basis accident, constituted the key subject for the study; therefore, the notorious Chernobyl Unit 4 event was outside the scope of the investigation. The present paper deals with the evaluation of the accident performance of the conﬁnement of the RBMK. Ignalina- 2 and Smolensk- 3 Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) are considered. The documented activity includes four main parts: (a) description of key features of the conﬁnement for the two NPP; (b) identiﬁcation and characterization of relevant accident scenarios part of the (DBA) area; (c) key features and qualiﬁcation level of adopted computation tools primarily including codes and input decks; (d) results from the analysis of selected accident scenarios. In the ﬁrst part of the paper, the layout complexity of the RBMK conﬁnement systems, including the building {{on the top of the}} reactor cavity is pointed out together with main differences between Smolensk- 3 and Ignalina- 2 units. Accident scenarios suitable for the analysis, second part of the paper, are derived from recently issued International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports, from the available Safety Analysis Reports (SAR) of existing RBMK NPP and from the list of bounding accidents derived from the already mentioned EC Project. The features of Cocosys and Relap 5 thermal–hydraulic system codes developed in Germany and US, respectively, are outlined in the third part of the paper, giving emphasis to the qualiﬁcation level in the range of parameters of interest to RBMK conﬁnement systems. The adopted nodalisations resembling Ignalina 2 and Smolensk 3 NPP are also described including the demonstration of the qualiﬁcation level.

40|$|This paper proposes the {{development}} of a new and innovative configuration based on single channel with <b>cavities</b> <b>plate</b> type wall-coated microreformer (dimensions: 90 mm x 50 mm x 30 mm). Microchannels are patterned on the SS plate and fabricated to make a vaporizer unit. The reformer is in the form of two SS plates placed one above the other. The water-methanol mixture enters from the top cover plate and gets vaporised in the channels cut on the vaporiser plate. The mixture then flows through the reformer plates on which the cavities are engraved to enhance mixing of water-Methanol vapors. The catalyst is deposited on the fins of the reformer plates using a new promising technique for depositing nanostructured films namely, Solution Precursor Plasma Spray (SPPS) technique. The performance of the microreformer unit is investigated at various operating conditions of inlet feed flow rate, molar ratio of water to methanol and reforming temperature. The developed microreformer unit is able to generate enough hydrogen to produce a power output of 27 W. The proposed design can also overcome the issue of shape and size of manifolds and ensure equi-flow distribution for multiple microchannel type microreformer designs and appears simple and suitable from fabrication viewpoint.

This problem is receiving more and more research interest due to its practical applications in the engineering and the astrophysical research. The turbulent natural convection of air in an enclosed tall cavity with high aspect ratio (Ar = = H/W = 28. 6) is examined numerically. Two cases of differential temperature have been considered between the lateral <b>cavity</b> <b>plates</b> corresponding, respectively, to the low and high Rayleigh numbers: Ra = 8. 6. 10 5 and Ra = = 1. 43. 10 6. For these two cases, the flow {{is characterized by a}} turbulent low Reynolds number. This led us to improve the flow characteristics using two one point closure low-Reynolds number turbulence models: renormalization group κ-ε model and shear stress transport κ-ω model, derived from standard κ-ε model and standard κ-ω model, respectively. Both turbulence models have provided an excellent agreement with the experimental data. In order to choose the best model, the average Nusselt number is compared to the experiment and other numerical results. The vorticity components surfaces confirm that the flow canbe considered 2 -D with stretched vortex in the cavity core. Finally, a correlation between Nusselt number and Rayleigh number is obtained to predict the heat transfer characteristic...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. A flat plate tester was designed and built to determine friction factors and dynamic pressures for water flow over smooth, knurl, and <b>cavity</b> <b>plates.</b> Reynolds numbers between 2000 and 35000 were obtained at plate clearances of 0. 076 mm to 1. 270 mm. The friction factors were found to differ significantly from the Moody diagram in that at small clearances, laminar flow appears to not always conform to the [] line predicted by theory. In addition, it is seen that increasing the gap between the plates from the smallest clearance tested (0. 076 mm) to the largest clearance (1. 270 mm) results in a friction factor increase. This situation does not contradict the Moody diagram, which shows that friction factor should decrease for increased gap. Instead, it illustrates an evolving scenario within the flow field. The smaller gaps exhibit signs of Tollmein-Schlichting waves, which did not transition into turbulence because the smaller gaps tend to suppress the creation of vorticies. The result is a laminar flow field which renders substantially lower friction factors. As the clearance is increased, turbulent activity increases yielding, increased friction factors. As the gap increases further, the friction factor plateaus and then decreases with increased Gap, indicating a fully turbulent flow regime. In addition, while certain cavity geometries were found to generate oscillatory pressures, there was no normal mode resonance indicative of the "friction factor jump" reported by Ha (1991) ...|$|R
