30|$|Therefore, in this paper, a semi{{automatic}} {{system that}} fuses control by manual and automatic operation is proposed, which achieves a high work efficiency {{and a feeling}} of control that is the same as manual control, by the teleoperation of a <b>construction</b> <b>machine.</b> The target of this work is the hoist swing that is typically used during the operation of a <b>construction</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{teleoperation}} of a <b>construction</b> <b>machine</b> {{has a low}} {{work efficiency}} {{due to the lack}} of perspective. If an automatic system can provide assistance with the operator’s control, operators may feel uncomfortable. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a semiautomatic system with a high work efficiency and achieve a feeling of control that is the same as manual control using teleoperation of a <b>construction</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
30|$|A {{teleoperation}} system controls a <b>construction</b> <b>machine</b> from {{a remote}} place using images captured by a camera {{attached to the}} <b>construction</b> <b>machine.</b> During teleoperation, operators lack a visual field, the acceleration of the machine, {{the sound of an}} engine, and a sense of perspective. In particular, a two-dimensional (2 D) image makes it difficult to obtain a sense of perspective. A lack of perspective increases the working time because it is difficult for operators to adjust the position [3]. Past studies supplied a sense of perspective with three-dimensional images [4], superimposed computer graphics (CG) [5], etc. However, three-dimensional images tire the operators because the working distance of a <b>construction</b> <b>machine</b> is different from the screen distance. Superimposed CG provides distance information to the operators. The tip of a <b>construction</b> <b>machine</b> was superimposed on the ground with CG. However, the CG information is in a different format from the normal perspective. Therefore, operators must think and convert the CG information into the perspective information in their mind. In contrast, autonomous operation can control the position accurately and quickly by measuring the distance to the target.|$|R

30|$|In an experiment, {{operators}} controlled {{a mobile}} robot by steering to trace reference lines. However, in our <b>construction</b> <b>machine,</b> operators {{control on the}} basis of a work plan without a detailed reference trajectory. Operators have common actions, e.g., excavation and manipulation of a hoist arm. Operators change these actions according to the work target, habitual actions, and work progress. In particular, in teleoperation, it is difficult for operators to control the tip of a <b>construction</b> <b>machine</b> in three-dimensional space without perspective.|$|R

30|$|Autonomous {{operation}} {{plans and}} controls the <b>construction</b> <b>machine</b> with measured around information. Yamamoto proposed autonomous excavating operation using a hydraulic excavator [2]. The complete {{calculation of the}} behaviors of stone and sand is difficult, as these behaviors may change owing to the machine control, the weight, the ratio of water content, the ratio of composition, etc. It {{is not easy to}} measure the ratio of water content and the ratio of composition. Even if this information can be measured, the large number of particles of sand will make real-time calculation difficult. Therefore, current autonomous operation cannot control a <b>construction</b> <b>machine</b> in all situations. Of course, expert operators can manipulate the sand as they imagined {{as long as they are}} on board the machine.|$|R
30|$|The first {{experiment}} {{involves a}} 2 D CG situation.

50|$|Continuous tracks such {{as those}} used on {{military}} tanks or <b>construction</b> <b>machines</b> (i.e. caterpillar tracks) have metal track segments which may be rubber-coated.
