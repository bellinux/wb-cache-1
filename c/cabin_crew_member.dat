40|$|The 1 -year {{prevalence}} of regular or continuous neck pain in military helicopter pilots of the Dutch Defense Helicopter Command (DHC) is 20 %, and physical work exposures {{have been suggested}} as risk factors.

The aims {{of the current study}} were to compare the exposures to physical work factors between these occupations and to estimate the 1 -year {{prevalence of}} neck pain in military helicopter <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members.</b> A survey was completed by almost all available helicopter pilots (n = 113) and <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> (n = 61) of the DHC. The outcome measures were self-reported neck pain and exposures to nine physical work factors. Differences in the proportions of helicopter pilots and <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> reporting being often exposed to the particular physical factor were assessed with the χ(2) test. The 1 -year prevalence of regular or continuous neck pain among <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> was 28 %. Significantly more <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> than pilots reported being often exposed to manual material handling, performing dynamic movements with their torsos, working in prolonged bent or twisted postures with their torsos and their necks, working with their arms raised and working in awkward postures. Often exposure to prolonged sitting and dynamic movements with the neck were equally reported by almost all the pilots and <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members.</b> Flight-related neck pain is prevalent in both military helicopter pilots and <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members.</b> The exposures to neck pain-related physical work factors differ between occupations, with the <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> subjected to more factors.
