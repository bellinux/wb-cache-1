Check <b>cashers</b> offer convenient check clearing and bill payment services, mostly tailored {{to meet the needs of}} the "unbanked" in low-and moderate income communities. The industry has grown dramatically over the years and is generating new products and services to meet the needs of its niche clientele. While some argue that check <b>cashers</b> are offering marginalized lower income Americans more responsive products than those available from banks, consumer advocates and community groups disagree. They argue that CCO customers pay too much for basic payment services, and that a reliance on check <b>cashers</b> keeps these lower-income individuals form being integrated into the financial mainstream.

5000|$|Plunkett {{had lifted}} and bread-boarded a {{transistorized}} tone-circuit from the Thomas Organ (an electric solid state transistorized organ) {{to duplicate the}} Jennings 3-position circuit. After adjusting and testing the amplifier with an electronic oscillator and oscilloscope, Plunkett connected the output to the speaker and tested the circuit audibly. At that point, several engineers and technical consultants, including Bill Page and Del <b>Casher,</b> noticed the sound effect caused by the circuit. Page insisted on testing this bread-boarded circuit while he played his saxophone through an amplifier. John Glennon, an assistant junior electronics engineer with the Thomas Organ Company, was summoned to bring a volume control pedal which {{was used in the}} Vox Continental Organ so that the transistorized MRB potentiometer bread-boarded circuit could be installed in the pedal's housing. After the installation, Page began playing his saxophone through the pedal and had asked Joe Banaron, CEO of Warwick Electronics Inc./Thomas Organ Company, to listen to the effect. At this point the first electric guitar was plugged into the prototype wah pedal by guitarist Del <b>Casher</b> who suggested to Joe Banaron that this was a guitar effects pedal rather than a wind instrument effects pedal. Banaron, being a fan of the big band style of music, was interested in marketing the wah pedal for wind instruments as suggested by Page rather than for the electric guitar as suggested by <b>Casher.</b> After a remark by <b>Casher</b> to Banaron regarding the Harmon mute style of trumpet playing in the famous recording of [...] "Sugar Blues" [...] from the 1930s, Banaron decided to market the wah-wah pedal using Clyde McCoy's name for endorsement.|$|E
40|$|<b>Casher's</b> argument, {{which is}} {{believed}} to be quite general, states that in the confining regime chiral symmetry is necessarily broken. In the large-N_c limit and at moderate and low temperatures QCD is confining up to arbitrary large densities, and there should appear a quarkyonic matter. It has been demonstrated, within a manifestly confining and chirally symmetric model, which is a 3 + 1 dimensional generalization of the 't Hooft model, that, at zero temperature and at a density exceeding a critical one, the chiral symmetry is restored while quarks remain confined in color-singlet hadrons. This is in conflict with the <b>Casher's</b> argument. Here we explain the reason why the <b>Casher's</b> argument fails and clarify the physical mechanism lying behind such confined but chirally symmetric hadrons.
