Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of <b>cost</b> <b>effectiveness,</b> light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E

40|$|Estimation of the {{incremental}} cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) {{is difficult for}} several reasons: treatments that decrease both <b>cost</b> and <b>effectiveness</b> and treatments that increase both <b>cost</b> and <b>effectiveness</b> can yield identical values of the ICER; the ICER is a discontinuous function of the mean difference in effectiveness; and the standard estimate of the ICER is a ratio. To address these difficulties, we have developed a Bayesian methodology that involves computing posterior probabilities for the four quadrants and separate interval estimates of ICER for the quadrants of interest. We compute these quantities by simulating draws from the posterior distribution of the <b>cost</b> and <b>effectiveness</b> parameters and tabulating the appropriate posterior probabilities and quantiles. We demonstrate the method by re-analysing three previously published clinical trials. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{cost-effectiveness}} analysis (CEA) {{deals with the}} comparison of health interventions based on both <b>costs</b> and <b>effectiveness</b> (ability to improve health). This dissertation makes several methodological contributions to this area. Part I develops direct methods for computing mean <b>costs</b> and <b>effectiveness,</b> and hence conducting CEA, in multi-state disease processes. The common approach {{in this case is}} to use discrete-event simulation techniques to simulate the process to get the associated <b>cost</b> and <b>effectiveness</b> outcomes. However, the setting up and implementation of simulation studies can be time and resource intensive. The dissertation develops analytical expressions for the time-to-failure, reward processes, and their (discounted) expectations for time-homogeneous semi-Markov processes with progressive structure. Direct Monte Carlo methods are proposed for time-varying multi-state processes. The advantages of these direct methods over discrete-event simulation are discussed. Sensitivity analysis to parameter estimation is also considered. The results are demonstrated on illustrative applications. Part II deals proposes a richer analysis of cost-effectiveness data from discrete event simulation of disease processes. Such simulations generate extensive amounts of data which are rarely examined in detail. The analysis is typically reduced to computing and comparing simple CEA metrics. This part of the dissertation proposes a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the data through graphical techniques. This includes examining both cross-sectional and temporal views of the time-to-failure, <b>cost,</b> and <b>effectiveness</b> distributions. The concept of a treatment-effect function is discussed, and it leads to generalized versions of two common CEA metrics. The potential for richer analysis is illustrated through various examples. Part III of the dissertation reviews the common CEA metrics based on means of the <b>cost</b> and <b>effectiveness</b> outcomes and discusses comparisons based on first and second-order stochastic dominance as well as utility functions. It also deals with methods for incorporating statistical uncertainty from estimating the unknown parameters in CEA. Large-sample normal approximations and resampling methods are reviewed. New contributions to the CEA literature include stochastic dominance comparisons in the presence of estimation uncertainty, use of rank methods, and analysis with censored data...|$|R
