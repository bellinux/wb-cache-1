40|$|A common {{belief is}} that {{agricultural}} marketing <b>cooperatives</b> <b>advertise</b> less than their investor-owned counterparts, holding other factors constant. This paper presents both a conceptual and an empirical analysis that questions this conventional wisdom. Our conceptual model analyzes a cooperative’s optimal advertising-to-sales (A/S) ratio under three alternative objective functions.

The empirical analysis examines forty-nine processed food markets, each containing at least one cooperative. The results do no support the conventional wisdom that <b>cooperatives</b> <b>advertise</b> less, ceteris paribus. The appearance that <b>cooperatives</b> <b>advertise</b> less is due to their predominance in industries with low margins and little product differentiation, factors that are associated with low advertising intensity regardless of a firm’s organizational form.

Secondly, the retailer's advertising and the manufacturer's participation ratios depend on both the retailer's and the manufacturer's marginal profits. Thirdly, the stimulating effect increases the advertising investment while the competition effect decreases it, {{but they have no}} effect on the manufacturer's participation ratio. Fourthly, co-op advertising is more sensitive to the manufacturer's marginal profits than those of the retailer.

30|$|The <b>cooperative</b> <b>advertising</b> {{literature}} can {{be categorized}} into three groups: static, dynamic and stochastic models.

Huang et al. (2002) argued that embarking on static examination of <b>cooperative</b> <b>advertising</b> is justified since promotion effects do not last long compared to advertising, and is primarily a driver of short term sales. However, empirical results in Naik et al.

40|$|<b>Cooperative</b> <b>advertising</b> is a {{practice}} that a manufacturer pays retailers {{a portion of the}} local advertising cost in order to induce sales. <b>Cooperative</b> <b>advertising</b> plays a significant role in marketing programs of channel members. Nevertheless, most studies to date on <b>cooperative</b> <b>advertising</b> have assumed that the market demand is only influenced by advertising expenditures but not by retail price. This paper addresses channel coordination by seeking optimal <b>cooperative</b> <b>advertising</b> strategies and equilibrium pricing in a two-member distribution channel. We establish and compare two models: a non-cooperative, leader-follower game and a cooperative game. We develop propositions and insights from the comparison of these models. The cooperative model achieves better coordination by generating higher channel-wide profits than the non-cooperative model with these features: (a) the retailer price is lower to consumers; and (b) the advertising efforts are higher for all channel members. We identify the feasible solutions to a bargaining problem where the channel members can determine how to divide the extra profits.

40|$|<b>Cooperative</b> (co-op) <b>advertising</b> plays a {{significant}} role in marketing programs in conventional supply chains and makes up the majority of promotional budgets in many product lines for both manufacturers and retailers. We develop three strategic models for determining equilibrium marketing and investment effort levels for a manufacturer and a retailer in a two-member supply chain. Especially, we address the impact of brand name investments, local advertising, and sharing policy on co-op advertising programs in these models. The first model offers a formal normative approach for analyzing the traditional co-op advertising program where the manufacturer is the leader and the retailer is a follower. The second model provides a further analysis on this manufacturer-dominated relationship. The third model incorporates the recent market trend of retailing power shifts from manufacturers to retailers to analyze efficiencies of co-op advertising programs. We examine the effect of supply chain on the differences in profits resulting from following coordinated strategies as opposed to leader-follower strategies. A cooperative bargaining approach is utilized for determine the best co-op advertising scheme for achieving full coordination in the supply chain. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|AbstractMost {{research}} about <b>cooperative</b> (coop) <b>advertising</b> programs in channels {{relies on the}} assumption that manufacturers and retailers decide of pricing and marketing efforts simultaneously. This paper evaluates this central assumption and investigates the optimal periodicity (sequence of move) of pricing and marketing efforts (ME) decisions for a distribution channel. We develop a game theoretic model that accounts for pricing at each level of the channel, for the manufacturer’s ME mix strategies (a direct ME to consumers and coop advertising program offered to the retailer) and the retailer’s ME as well. We obtain solutions for a bilateral channel under different vertical interaction scenarios; when the channel is led by the manufacturer, the retailer or when channel members decide simultaneously of each of their marketing mix decisions (vertical Nash). We compare the effect of pricing and ME decision periodicity on outputs for each channel member. The main findings suggest that simultaneous decision-making of pricing and ME is optimal only for high enough levels of the manufacturer’s ME effects. For very highly effective marketing efforts, sequential play of pricing and ME allows channel members to implement equilibrium strategies and achieve maximum profits that would not be achieved with simultaneous decision-making. This highlights the importance of relaxing the simultaneous play assumption of pricing and ME in a distribution channel...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{characterize}} <b>cooperative</b> and noncooperative <b>advertising</b> strategies of a licensor and licensee involved in a licensing contract in the fashion business. Licensing is the process of leasing a legally protected entity (brand, name, logo, etc.) in conjunction with a product or product line. It is based on a contractual agreement between two business entities: the owner of the property, called licensor; and the renter of the rights, called licensee. Licensing is seen as a win-win strategy, in which the two partners can achieve their objectives (e. g., expanding the brand, its market reach, etc.). We show that, if the licensor, who acts as the leader, uses an incentive strategy that depends on the licensee advertising, then it can reach the jointly optimal solution in a decentralized way...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cooperative</b> <b>advertising</b> {{programs}} are usually provided by manufacturers to stimulate retailers investing more in local advertising {{to increase the}} sales of their products or services. While previous literature on <b>cooperative</b> <b>advertising</b> mainly focuses on a “single-manufacturer single-retailer” framework, the decision-making framework with “multiple-manufacturer single-retailer” becomes more realistic because of the increasing power of retailers {{as well as the}} increased competition among the manufacturers. In view of this, in this paper we investigate the <b>cooperative</b> <b>advertising</b> program in a “two-manufacturer single-retailer” supply chain in three different scenarios; that is, (i) each channel member makes decisions independently; (ii) the retailer is vertically integrated with one manufacturer; (iii) two manufacturers are horizontally integrated. Utilizing differential game theory, the open-loop equilibrium-advertising strategies of each channel member are obtained and compared. Also, we investigate the effects of competitive intensity on the firm’s profit in three different scenarios by using the numerical analysis...|$|E

40|$|Cooperative {{education}} is an educational method that offers many opportunities and benefits to students, employers, and higher educational institutions. Higher education has traditionally resisted marketing in any form. This {{has largely been}} the result of the traditional, narrow promotional concept of marketing. In contrast to this view, marketing may be viewed as a central activity of modern institutions that grows out of their quest to serve some area of human need effectively,. n activity that is essential to their continued survival and success. As it applies to higher educational' institutions, marketing may be defined as gathering and assessing information on customer needs and planning and executing activities designed to bring about an awareness of program and service offerings. Many analysts see a sink or swim case for matketing college and university cooperative education programs. Those responsible for marketing cooperative education programs must realize that these programs have a variety of internal and external publics that need to be served, i. e., students, faculty, administrators, employers, potential students, and parents. Each of these publics must be kept in mind when analyzing product life cycles, doing market research, formulating a marketing strategy, and developing and evaluating a marketing plan.

40|$|Social play, a {{widespread}} phenomenon in mammals, is a multifunctional behavior, which can have many different roles according to species, sex, age, relationship quality between playmates, group membership, context, and habitat. Play joins and cuts across {{a variety of}} disciplines leading directly to inquiries relating to individual developmental changes and species adaptation, thus the importance of comparative studies appears evident. Here, we aim at proposing a possible ontogenetic pathway of chimpanzee play (Pan troglodytes) and contrast our data with those of human play. Chimpanzee play shows a number of changes from infancy to juvenility. Particularly, solitary and social play follows different developmental trajectories. While solitary play peaks in infancy, social play does not show any quantitative variation between infancy and juvenility but shows a strong qualitative variation in complexity, asymmetry, and playmate choice. Like laughter in humans, the playful expressions in chimpanzees (at the different age phases) seem to have a role in <b>advertising</b> <b>cooperative</b> dispositions and intentions thus increasing the likelihood of engaging in solid social relationships. In conclusion, in chimpanzees, as in humans, both play behavior and the signals that accompany play serve multiple functions according to the different age phases...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{proposed}} functions of human smiling is the <b>advertise</b> <b>cooperative</b> dispositions and thereby {{increase the likelihood that}} a social partner would invest resources in a relationship. In particular, smiles involving an emotional component would be honest signals of altruistic dispositions because they are not easy to produce voluntarily. In this study, 60 people were covertly filmed while interacting with a friend in two conditions: control and sharing. Smiles were classified into Duchenne (spontaneous) and non-Duchenne smiles. Participants also completed a series of questionnaires, including the Altruism Scale and a self-report questionnaire of emotional state. Interestingly, Duchenne smiles were displayed at higher rates in the sharing situation as opposed to the control situation, whereas non-Duchenne smiles were unaffected by the type of interaction. Furthermore, Duchenne smiles in the sharing interaction were positively affected by a measure of altruism. Self-reported emotional states did not vary between conditions and were poorly related to smiling. This study shows that the Duchenne smile is relevant to situations that involve the sharing of material resources because it would reliably advertise altruistic intentions. The Duchenne smile could therefore be an important signal in the formation and maintenance of cooperative relationships.
