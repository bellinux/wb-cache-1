5|$|Before the Eighty Years' War began, people {{realized}} that the West Indies trade might bring great prosperity to the <b>country</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> more power might be developed against Spain. Rather than travel to the area singly on an armed ship or {{in the company of}} a few other vessels, traders could do business in the manner of the large and prosperous East India Company. A company for carrying on commerce in the West Indies and Africa could be organized, which might, like the sister company, act as the war-waging power in those parts and be supported by the treasury, ships, and troops of the United Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|The second {{presentation}} {{was given by}} a representative of Scout Moor Wind Farm, who argued the need for Britain to produce clean green power without harmful emissions, to counter the increasing dangers of global warming. He {{went on to say}} that the UK has fewer wind farms than other major industrial countries in Europe, even though it is a windier <b>country,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> North West England has a particularly poor record, with only 1.3% of electricity generated from renewable energy. Following this meeting the campaign to oppose the proposal gathered momentum, and in November 2003 a protest was held on the moor, led by environmental campaigner Professor David Bellamy.|$|E

He asked them to join his party in a toast to the health of King George II, and to kneel in allegiance. He told his guides that he would have set fire to the townhouse and killed the assembled Indians if they refused.|$|E
