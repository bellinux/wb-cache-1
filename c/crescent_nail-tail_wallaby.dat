5000|$|The [...] "nail-tail" [...] is {{a feature}} common to two {{other species of}} wallabies: the {{northern}} nail-tail wallaby and the <b>crescent</b> <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> (which was declared to be extinct in 1956).|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} nail-tail wallaby (Onychogalea unguifera) {{also known}} as the sandy nail-tail wallaby, is a species of macropod found in Queensland, Western Australia and Northern Territory. Unlike the bridled nail-tail wallaby (O. fraenata), the northern nail-tail wallaby is not a threatened species. The only other member of the genus, the <b>crescent</b> <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> (O. lunata), is extinct.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crescent</b> <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> (Onychogalea lunata) was a nail-tail wallaby {{that lived}} in the {{woodlands}} and scrubs {{of the west and}} centre of Australia. It had silky fur and, like other nail-tail wallabies, had a horny spur at the tip of its tail. It {{was the size of a}} hare and was the smallest nail-tail wallaby at about 15 inches tall. When it was chased, it tended to seek refuge in a hollow tree. It entered at the bottom, clambered up and appeared at an opening high above. While running, the species held its forelimbs awkwardly and moved them in a rotary motion.|$|E
50|$|The <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallabies</b> (genus Onychogalea) {{are three}} species of macropod found in Australia. They are {{distinguished}} by a horny spur {{at the end}} of their tail. While the northern <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> is still common in the northern part of Australia, the <b>crescent</b> <b>nail-tail</b> is now extinct, and the bridled nail-tail is considered rare and endangered, with probably fewer than 1100 mature individuals in the wild. <b>Nail-tail</b> <b>wallabies</b> are smaller than many other wallabies.|$|R

50|$|The <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallabies</b> (genus Onychogalea), as {{indicated}} by their common name, possess a spur {{on the end of}} their tails.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{programs}} at the sanctuary include the southern cassowary, estuarine crocodile, northern bettong, common wombat, koala, <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby,</b> eclectus parrot, and black-headed python.|$|R
5000|$|Bridled <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> (Onychogalea fraenata), {{thought to}} be extinct since the last {{confirmed}} sighting in 1937, but rediscovered by a fencing contractor on his property in rural Queensland in 1973.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> by far {{the largest}} species in the genus Onychogalea. It is a solitary, nocturnal browser feeding on a variety of foliage. It is a sandy colour, which gave rise to its other common name.|$|R
50|$|The bridled <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> {{can grow}} to one metre in length, {{half of which}} is tail, and weighs 4-8 kg. Females are {{somewhat}} smaller than the males. The tail spur can be 3-6 mm long and partly covered in hair. Its purpose is unclear.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, a {{population}} of Bridled <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallabies</b> (Onychogalea fraenata) {{was found in the}} Dingo area by a fencing contractor. Until this sighting the species was thought to be extinct having not been seen since 1937. The area where the wallabies was rediscovered was protected as Taunton National Park.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of European {{settlement}} of Australia, bridled <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallabies</b> were common all along the East Australian coastline region {{to the west of}} the Great Dividing Range. Naturalists in the 19th century reported that the species ranged from the Murray River region of Victoria through central New South Wales to Charters Towers in Queensland.|$|R
5|$|The area {{comprises}} semi-arid stony ridges, claypans and a stony plateau, {{and experiences}} a sub-tropical climate, {{with a wet}} season between January and March. The vegetation is mostly scrubland, including spinifex grasslands. The fauna is generally typical of Australian desert environments, and includes the red kangaroo, the eastern wallaroo, the northern <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby,</b> and the spinifex hopping mouse.|$|R
50|$|The lower Ord River {{contains}} a high density of salt water crocodiles. The mangroves support {{at least six}} species of microbat, the black flying-fox and grassland melomys. Other mammals known from the site include: the northern <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby,</b> agile wallaby, long-haired rat and Kimberley rock rat. The critically endangered largetooth sawfish has been collected from the lower Ord River.|$|R
5000|$|The bridled <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> is of {{interest}} to marsupial researchers because {{it appears to have}} a more vigorous immune system than other species of macropods. In the words of Central Queensland University based marsupial immunologist Lauren Young, [...] "These wallabies appear to be able to survive parasite infections, viruses and various diseases more readily than other marsupials".|$|R
50|$|The bridled <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> (Onychogalea fraenata), {{also known}} as the bridled nail-tailed wallaby, bridled nailtail wallaby, bridled wallaby, merrin, and flashjack, is a {{vulnerable}} species of macropod. It is a small wallaby found in three isolated areas in Queensland, Australia, and whose population is declining. The total population of the species is currently estimated to be less than 1,100 mature individuals in the wild.|$|R
5000|$|Taunton National Park is {{designated}} as a strictly scientific nature reserve due to its importance in ensuring the ongoing survival and protection of the endangered bridled <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> (Onychogalea fraenata). [...] The wallabies protection has facilitated natural [...] processes within reserve boundaries, protected ecosystem communities from further agricultural disturbances in the surrounding landscape, provided habitats for native fauna and helped conserve {{a wide range of}} biodiversity.|$|R
50|$|Since its rediscovery, the bridled <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> {{has been}} the target of private {{conservation}} efforts to re-establish viable populations. Captive breeding programs have allowed the establishment of three populations; two in State reserves located at Idalia and Taunton National Parks, and another on a private reserve, Project Kial, located near Marlborough in Central Queensland. The extant population is currently estimated to be less than 1,100 mature individuals in the wild.|$|R
50|$|The {{region is}} home to the unadorned rock-wallaby and the black-striped wallaby, which lives in the areas of vine thicket along with a {{wingless}} dung beetle (Onthophagus apterus). Two endangered mammals are found in the Brigalow Belt; the bridled <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> in Taunton and Idalia National Parks, and the burrowing northern hairy-nosed wombat in the grassland and eucalyptus of Epping Forest National Park. Birds found here include black-throated finch and russet-tailed thrush, while endemic reptiles include the Fitzroy River turtle.|$|R
5|$|Most of the region's fauna {{is typical}} of desert environments. Species include the red kangaroo, the eastern wallaroo (also known as the euro), the {{northern}} <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby,</b> and the spinifex hopping mouse. The central pebble-mound mouse also occurs in the region, and other mammal species including the Forrest's mouse, desert mouse and short-beaked echidna have been predicted by biologists to occur on the station. The station may lie {{within the range of}} the critically endangered night parrot (Pezoporus occidentalis). There is relatively high diversity and abundance of reptiles, including the military dragon (Ctenophorus isolepis gularis) and the sand goanna (Varanus gouldii flavirufus).|$|R
50|$|There are few {{endemic species}} as these grasslands {{are typical of}} much of {{northern}} Australia at this latitude but the grasslands are nonetheless largely intact and rich in wildlife. Mammals include the large eastern wallaroo, northern <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> (Onychogalea unguifera), and the long-tailed planigale which is the smallest marsupial in the world. The lancewoods are home to the spectacled hare-wallaby (Lagorchestes conspicillatus), while the Bungle Bungle has some unique plants and an endemic Lerista skink lizard the Lerista bunglebungle. Mammals that have become depleted or disappeared from these grasslands include the bilby (Macrotis lagotis), northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) and golden bandicoot (Isoodon auratus).|$|R
5000|$|In 1973 a bridled <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> was sighted on {{a cattle}} {{property}} named 'Taunton' and reported by a fencing contractor. [...] There had been {{reports of a}} significant decline in the wallabies population numbers during the early 1900s with no recorded sightings since the 1930s, and subsequently the species had been presumed extinct. [...] Following this sighting, Taunton was purchased in 1979 and established as a scientific reserve, solely to ensure the protection and survival of the endangered wallaby. [...] Then in 1984, another cattle property 'Red Hill', situated adjacent to Taunton, {{was added to the}} reserve and the whole area later became officially named 'Taunton National Park'.|$|R
50|$|These grasslands are {{the western}} limit {{for much of}} the {{wildlife}} that lives here as further west is desert. Wildlife of the savanna includes mammals such as the mouse-like kultarr marsupial (Antechinomys laniger), tiger quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), and brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata). The western barred bandicoot (Perameles bougainville fasciata) and bridled <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> that once lived here are now presumed extinct in New South Wales. Birds include the endangered bush stone-curlew (Burhinus grallarius), superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii), red goshawk (Erythrotriorchis radiatus), malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) and plains-wanderer (Pedionomus torquatus), and reptiles include an endangered skink Anomalopus mackayi. The Riverina grasslands are home to birds such as the freckled duck, and wintering populations of swift parrot (Lathamus discolor).|$|R
50|$|The {{wallabies}} {{are most}} active during the night-time and dusk periods. Day is usually spent sleeping in hollows near bushes or trees. In modern habitats, nail-tails keep {{close to the}} edges of pasture grasses. These wallabies have a reputation as shy and solitary animals. They may occasionally form small groups of up to four to feed together when grazing is in short supply. The bridled <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> likes to avoid confrontation and has two main ways of avoiding threats - hiding in hollow logs and crawling under low shrubs. If caught in the open, it may try to lie completely still hoping not to be observed. After a gestation period of about 23 days, the single joey undergoes further development in the mother's pouch for around four more months.|$|R
40|$|Acacia harpophylla F. Muell. (brigalow) used to {{naturally}} occur over a {{range of}} about 50 000 km 2 in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Large scale clearing for agriculture has reduced the area to less than 20 000 km 2 and {{it is estimated that}} 20 - 25 % of vertebrate fauna living in brigalow communities will become locally extinct {{as a result of the}} current clearing induced loss of habitat. Some coal mining companies in central Queensland have become interested in providing habitat for the endangered bridle nail-tailed wallaby that lives in brigalow vegetation. However, there is little known about establishment techniques for brigalow on mine sites and other disturbed ground; an understanding of brigalow biology and ecology is required to assist in the conservation of this threatened vegetation community and for re-creation of bridled <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> habitat in the post mining landscape. Brigalow is an unusual species of Acacia because it is not hard-seeded and germinates readily without the need to break seed-coat imposed dormancy. Germination trials were undertaken to test the ability of brigalow seed to germinate with {{a range of}} temperatures and salinity levels similar to those experienced in coal mine spoil. Optimum germination was found to occur at temperatures from 15 to 38 °C and no germination was recorded at 45 °C. Brigalow was very tolerant of high salt levels and germinated at percentages greater than 50 % up to the highest salinity tested, 30 dS/m...|$|R
5000|$|Management of Taunton National Park is {{conducted}} by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS), under the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection (DERM). [...] To ensure that cultural heritage values are protected with park management decisions, there is an ongoing partnership between the QPWS and the indigenous land owners; the Kangoulu and Ghungalu people. [...] General objectives of park management include ensuring the protection and preservation of the parks ecological and biological diversity and values, and ensuring the continued survival of the bridled <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> through provision of predator control and adequate habitat and food resources. [...] Pest plant management is ongoing {{in order to control}} the range and establishment of invasive plant species, and reduce competition with native plants. [...] In addition, regular predator control measures are implemented to lower predation pressures on the wallaby, and continued monitoring {{is conducted}} to assess the effects and success rate of these pest management strategies. [...] Domestic stock animals are excluded from the park via fencing, to reduce competition for the wallabies food resources as well as preventing ground and vegetation compaction via trampling. [...] Wallaby population abundance is monitored by quarterly 4-day surveys which span the entire park, to ensure rapid management responses to notable declines in numbers, while issues arising from fire threats, such as destruction of the wallabies brigalow shrub habitat, are managed through fire breaks and controlled burn regimes.|$|R
40|$|Threatened {{species with}} reduced and {{fragmented}} habitats can be reintroduced into their historical ranges to establish new populations. Multiple sites {{might be an}} option for reintroductions; therefore, managers must determine when to open sites (e. g. establish infrastructure and improve conditions), release individuals into those sites, and eventually cease releases. Careful planning of this schedule, incorporating the cost of actions, is imperative {{at the outset of}} a program. To address this challenge, we consider a reintroduction plan under different cost scenarios for three potential reintroduction sites. In particular, we investigate the implications of having either no ongoing site-management cost, a financial ongoing site-management cost, or a demographic cost of continuous releases. We couple population and management models to find a schedule that maximizes total abundance over time of bridled <b>nail-tail</b> <b>wallaby</b> Onychogalea fraenata (released in fixed numbers each breeding season from a stable source population) using stochastic dynamic programming. We find that the type of ongoing cost influences the structure of the optimal schedule. If active release sites cost nothing to maintain, there is no incentive to cease releases. In that case, the optimal schedule is to open sites sequentially, then release individuals to the smallest active population for {{the entire length of the}} program. A financial cost for managing active sites alters this result; once all sites are open and have populations of a critical threshold size, sites should be closed sequentially. A higher mortality rate (demographic cost) at active compared to inactive sites completely changes the structure of the optimal strategy. Instead of opening all sites in the first few management stages, only one site should be active any time to reduce the demographic impact of releases. Our general results provide a guide for planning future reintroduction programs and illustrate the importance of categorizing and understanding ongoing costs for reintroduction planning...|$|R
