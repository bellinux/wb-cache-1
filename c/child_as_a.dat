5|$|Gabrielle and Carlos are in {{the middle}} of a {{prolonged}} divorce. Carlos has moved into an apartment across town and Gabrielle is forced to care for Xiao-Mei, who is over eight months pregnant and on bed rest. During an argument, Gabrielle threatens to send Xiao-Mei back to China after she has the baby. Later, Gabrielle discovers that Xiao-Mei has run away and enlists Carlos' help to find her. The two bicker before acknowledging the challenges they will face while trying to raise a <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> divorced couple. Edie Britt (Nicollette Sheridan) finds Xiao-Mei in a house that she has been trying to sell and notifies the Solises.|$|E
5|$|In India, a 14th-century Indian text {{mentioning}} {{a lesbian}} couple {{who had a}} <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of their lovemaking is {{an exception to the}} general silence about female homosexuality. This invisibility disappeared with the release of a film titled Fire in 1996, prompting some theaters in India to be attacked by extremists. Terms used to label homosexuals are often rejected by Indian activists for being the result of imperialist influence, but most discourse on homosexuality centers on men. Women's rights groups in India continue to debate the legitimacy of including lesbian issues in their platforms, as lesbians and material focusing on female homosexuality are frequently suppressed.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with gender}} equality, {{the issue of}} {{parenting}} under the communal way of life was a concern. The parental tendency is to view the <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> personal possession and to dominate them. The founding members of the kibbutz agreed {{that this was not}} conducive to community life. They also thought it was selfish of parents to want to control their children and that this did not give room for the child to grow as their own person.|$|E
25|$|Mormaer Donnchad II (1154–1204), anglicized as Duncan II or Dunecan II, succeeded {{his father}} Donnchad I as a <b>child.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> {{child of the}} {{previous}} Mormaer, he was entitled to succeed his father through primogeniture, but not to lead his kin-group, Clann MacDuib. That probably fell to his cousin, Aed mac Gille Míchéil. Like previous Mormaers of Fife, Donnchad II was appointed Justiciar of Scotia (i.e. Scotland North of the Forth). Donnchad's minority also meant that Ferchar, Mormaer of Strathearn, took supreme place {{as head of the}} Gaelic nobility and guide for the boy-king Máel Coluim IV.|$|E

25|$|A brush is the {{traditional}} writing instrument for Chinese calligraphy. The body of the brush is commonly made from bamboo or other materials such as wood, porcelain, or horn. The head of the brush is typically made from animal hair, such as weasel, rabbit, deer, goat, pig, tiger, wolf, etc. There is also a tradition in both China and Japan of making a brush using the hair of a newborn <b>child,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> once-in-a-lifetime souvenir. This practice {{is associated with the}} legend of an ancient Chinese scholar who scored first in the imperial examinations by using such a personalized brush. Calligraphy brushes are widely considered an extension of the calligrapher's arm.|$|E
25|$|According to {{classical}} rabbinical sources, Benjamin was only born after Rachel had fasted {{for a long}} time, as a religious devotion {{with the hope of}} a new <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reward. By then Jacob had become over 100 years old. Benjamin is treated as a young child in most of the Biblical narrative, but at one point is abruptly described as the father of ten sons. Textual scholars believe that this {{is the result of the}} genealogical passage, in which his children are named, being from a much later source than the Jahwist and Elohist narratives, which make up most of the Joseph narrative, and which consistently describe Benjamin as a child.|$|E
25|$|The story {{continues}} with King Herod asking his advisers about ancient prophesies describing {{the birth of}} such a <b>child.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of their advice, he sends soldiers to kill every boy child {{under the age of}} two in the city of Bethlehem. But Joseph has been warned in a dream, and flees to Egypt with Mary and the baby, Jesus. The gruesome scene of the Massacre of the Innocents, as the murder of the babies is generally referred, was particularly depicted by Early Renaissance and Baroque painters. The Flight into Egypt was another popular subject, showing Mary with the baby on a donkey, led by Joseph (borrowing the older iconography of the rare Byzantine Journey to Bethlehem).|$|E

25|$|The OECD {{reported}} on Irish schools {{and levels of}} education in 1962-68, as {{an essential part of}} the process of Ireland's 1973 accession into the EEC, providing the vital external stimulus for reform. Finally the 1970 Kennedy Report, prepared in 1967-70, though flawed in parts, led to the abolition of the schools over the next decade, starting with Artane in 1969. In the interim, tens of thousands of children had been inmates, some from infancy. Despite frequent complaints and enquiries that called for reforms, the official line until the 1990s was that nobody in government, the church or the civil service really knew what was taking place. Notably, Micheal Martin stated on 13 May 1999 that: The concept of the <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate individual with rights came late to this country.|$|E
25|$|A {{clinical}} {{professor of law at}} the University of Michigan in the Child Advocacy Law Clinic, and Director of the Detroit Center for Family Advocacy. Dr. Sankaran has litigated numerous cases before the Michigan Supreme Court on behalf of parents. He also was appointed by Governor Rick Snyder to the Child Abuse Prevention Board. Sankaran testified on February 26, 2014 that more children would be adopted if same-sex couples had the same joint-adoption rights as married heterosexual couples. He noted that nearly 14,000 children in Michigan’s foster care system need homes, saying that allowing joint adoption by same-sex couples would expand the pool of potential parents for those children, which includes about 3,500 orphans. Sankaran added that if one of them adopts a <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single person, which the state allows, the other has no legal rights to custody of the child if the other parent dies or is incapacitated.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{potential}} victim {{has come into}} contact with state authorities, identifying the <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> victim of trafficking takes time. The process often benefits from a thorough understanding of the child’s story. For a child who is in trouble with the law, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers and officers determine if the child is actually a victim of a crime herself, such as exploitation, abuse, or trafficking. For a child in an administrative process, such as an asylum procedure, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers to detect cases of trafficking. Children may be hesitant to share their complete stories with authorities and appointed child welfare professionals. Some service providers have found that establishing trust and a stable relationship with the child encourages increased disclosure of experiences of exploitation and trafficking that might otherwise not be detected. The trust building process can include granting assistance and support services to ensure safety, well-being and development.|$|E

25|$|Some {{art historians}} once {{identified}} the <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> young Cosimo I de' Medici, {{but it is}} now generally accepted to be Giulia. The child in the portrait {{appears to be a}} little girl, rather than a boy, and her expression is anxious. Maria Salviati, who is dressed soberly as befitted a widow, is seen sheltering the vulnerable child against her side. Art historian Gabrielle Langdon argues that the girl's demeanor in the portrait is different than would have been expected for the child Cosimo, whose family anticipated his role as a strong leader from his earliest days. It would have been to Cosimo I's advantage to commission a portrait depicting his mother as an exemplary widow, affectionately bringing up the orphaned daughter of Cosimo I's predecessor. The child's full lips, round nose, and curly reddish hair also bear little resemblance to known portraits of Cosimo as a child, though they do to portraits of the young Alessandro. Other girls of about the right age who were at court during this period also do not resemble the child in the portrait. The portrait might {{be one of the first}} in Renaissance-era Europe of a girl of presumed African and European ancestry. This painting is in the permanent collection of The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
25|$|A {{villager}} (Vichare) {{brings his}} 8-year-old grandson Parshuraam (also known as Parshya) {{to a doctor}} in Pune to diagnose the child's eyes. They are accompanied by Parshya's maternal uncle Diwakar. On the first day Vichare is asked to sign the usual papers before admission in hospital. Upon asking, he learns that the papers say the doctor would not be responsible if anything goes wrong. Vichare, the rustic grandfather finds these terms unacceptable. A medical social worker, Aasawari, quickly comes in and explains the practice to Vichare. She calms him down and accompanies them during the first appointment with the doctor. Dr. Sane quickly diagnoses <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> victim of retinoblastoma — a rare retinal cancer. After consulting with other colleagues in US and UK doctor finds that only way to save child's life is to perform an operation that will leave the child blind. As per rule, doctor explains this and insists child be informed of this before surgery. He cannot be operated without this knowledge as it was against ethics. Aasawari (Amruta Subhash) who helps the doctor in convincing the grandfather and the grandson, tries {{to keep track of}} Vichare and persuades him not fall prey to other doctors promising false medicines. She tries to befriend Parshya to explain him what is going to happen. However, she finds it is too difficult to explain to him that he will turn blind.|$|E
