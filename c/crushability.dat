40|$|International audienceMechanical {{characteristics}} (i. e., stiffness, {{internal friction}} angle, peak strength) and <b>crushability</b> of a soft granular material {{were evaluated by}} performing a comprehensive series of laboratory tests using the following devices: standard and non-standard triaxial apparatus, direct and annular shear box, oedometer and hydrostatic devices. The initial tested specimens differ by initial void ratio, grading characteristics and particle hardness. The air-dried specimen of soft particles were then subjected to monotonic loadings for various stress paths (direct and annular shear stress paths, oedometer stress paths until different upper normal pressures, triaxial stress paths including different confining pressures). After each homogeneous test, sieving has been performed in order to characterize the evolution of grading characteristics of the granular packing. Experimental results on mechanical properties show that maximum internal friction angle is rather independent of the particle stiffness even though small differences may exist before peak stress-state. As highlighted by recent studies (Arslan in Granul Matter 11 (2) : 87 - 97, 2009), the volumetric response of the specimen indicates that classical critical state is no more a relevant framework when particle <b>crushability</b> is too high compared with the applied stress-state. <b>Crushability</b> related to loading paths has been evaluated through the relative breakage ratio (Br). The first results pointed out the effects of initial geometrical configuration (i. e., void ratio, grading) and particle stiffness.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{well known}} that {{particle}} crushing plays a critical role in the mechanical behavior of granular soils. Understanding energy dissipation under the influence of particle breakage is of key importance to the development of micromechanics-based constitutive models for sands. This paper reports the original results of the energy input/dissipation of an idealized crushable soil using 3 D DEM simulations. Particle breakage is modeled as the disintegration of the synthetic agglomerate particles which are made up of parallel-bonded elementary spheres. A parametric study is performed to fully investigate the effects of initial specimen density and <b>crushability</b> on the energy allocation of the crushable soil. The simulation results show that the initial specimen density and the <b>crushability</b> strongly affect the energy allocation of the soil both at small and large strains. The major roles of particle breakage, which itself only dissipates a negligible amount of input energy, are to advance changes in the soil fabric and to promote the interparticle friction dissipation. Particularly, at small strains, particle breakage disrupts the strain energy buildup, and thus, reduces the mobilized shear strength and dilatancy of a granular soil. At large strains, where particle breakage is greatly reduced, steady energy dissipation by interparticle friction and mechanical damping is observed. Furthermore, it is found that shear bands develop in most dense crushable specimens at large strains, but they are only weakly correlated to the anisotropy of the accumulated friction dissipation...|$|E

40|$|Comminution or feed size {{reduction}} is typically {{the first stage}} of ore processing at mines. Comminution tests are commonly conducted to assess the processing behavior of ore and to aid in process design and equipment selection. Testing for Bond mill work index (BMWi), a measure of the ore grindability, and A*b, a measure of the ore <b>crushability,</b> is common in this regard. These destructive tests are expensive and time consuming and, hence, are conducted on a limited number of large volume samples which in most cases are not representative of the entire orebody. Therefore alternative means are desirable for efficiently characterizing comminution behavior. Petrophysical properties have the potential for effective characterization of ore comminution behavior for a truly representative suite of samples. Petrophysical measurements are quick, non-destructive, and relatively cheap. Petrophysical data can be recorded either downhole or on core. If calibrated against measures of ore <b>crushability</b> and grindability, petrophysically-based models could provide virtually continuous downhole prediction of comminution attributes in intervals of drill holes where these parameters are not available. This thesis presents a new approach for characterization of ore comminution behavior based on petrophysical measurements. As an alternative to downhole geophysical logging, a Geotek multi-sensor core logger (MSCL) was evaluated. Density, P-wave velocity, P-wave amplitude and magnetic susceptibility, as well as core imagery, were measured on drill cores from two Australian copper-gold deposits, namely Cadia-East, NSW, and Ernest Henry, QLD.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of dry and wet one-dimenional compression tests on a calcareous sand from the Persian Gulf. Calcareous grains crush more easily compared to silica grains, a fact that is mainly attributed to their angular shape and weaker mineralogical and complicates their geotechnical behaviour. With regard to the use of crushable sands in construction projects, the question arises whether the presence of water further influences their <b>crushability,</b> and thus performance. The oedometer tests discussed in this paper, are part of a larger study on the influence of water on the stress-strain behaviour of calcareous sands. Dry samples are prepared in oedometers at a relevant density and either kept dry or flushed with water. Loading occurs in ten increments up until a vertical stress of 8. 6 MPa and afterwards the sand is sieved to evaluate crushing. The behaviour of the crushable sand is shown to be significantly affected by the water as soon as crushing is initiated. The total settlements and the <b>crushability</b> are higher for the wet sand. When a distinction is made between primary and secondary compression, it is found that wet sand compresses more than dry sand during consolidation phase, but less during secondary compression phase. As a result, the observed net differences decrease with longer loading time whereas a higher rate of loading furthers the increased compression of wet calcareous sand. The tests are repeated on Molsand, a non-crushable silica sand. For this sand, within the stress range tested, the net deformation is identical for wet and dry conditions. The elevated stresses were not high enough to crush the grains and yield the material. The water dependency of crushable sands already exists at moderate stress levels, so it is of great importance to incorporate the accelerated crushing of wet particles in the geotechnical engineering practice...|$|E

The physical, particle, compaction and mechanical properties of six selected types of clinker ash were thoroughly examined in this experimental investigation. Clinker ash owns very complex and angular shapes and it gives rise to the larger difference between the maximum and minimum void ratios. The single particle crushing strength of clinker ash is around 1 / 5 – 1 / 10 lower than natural sands and it indicates high <b>crushability</b> in nature. With similarity to natural sands, the mean crushing strength of clinker ash displays a decreasing tendency with the increase in grain diameter. Aseries of triaxial compression tests were performed on different types of clinker ash to examine the influences of particle characteristics, degree of compaction and effective confining pressure on their shear behaviour and deformation characteristics. Test results demonstrate that clinker ash possesses a higher peak friction angle at low effective confining pressures and gradually loses its shear strength with the rise in effective confining pressure. The great shear strength dependence on the stress level for clinker ash is confirmed. The stress-dila-tancy behaviour of a given type of clinker ash is minimally affected by the degree of compaction and level of effective confining pressure. The stress ratios at the critical state of clinker ash are well correlated with the mean crushing strengths. A larger N value for clinker ash determined using Nova's rule indicates its higher <b>crushability.</b> The downward shift of critical state line of clinker ash due to grain crushing is identified on the void ratio and logarithm of effective mean stress plane.

40|$|<b>Crushability</b> and {{grindability}} {{are traditionally}} {{used to describe}} the material properties in comminution. These parameters neglect the main objective of ore comminution, the mineral liberation and therefore information is incomplete. A new concept called liberability: the easiness of mineral liberation in comminution is introduced to fill the gap. Establishing a liberability map of a deposit requires grindability tests and liberation measurements for the grinding product. The liberability curve shows the degree of liberation of the mineral against grinding energy and offers better baseline for resource optimization than the grindability curve. A case study with a magnetite iron ore from Malmberget, northern Sweden, shows that certain shortcuts can be applied to keep the experimental effort reasonable which is important, particularly when applying the liberability in a geometallurgical program. In Malmberget the liberability is depending on the grade and grain size of magnetite. A significant difference between grindability and liberability can be observed.

40|$|The <b>crushability</b> of {{artificial}} and natural granular materials has been analyzed using one-dimensional strain-controlled compression tests and standard oedometer tests at high stress levels {{to study the}} effect on the breakage of a number of parameters such as: grain mineralogy, grain size, uniformity coefficient, strain rate and loading time. Measuring the breakage factor at different stages of compression, it was demonstrated that the crushing started before reaching the point of maximum curvature (yield point) in the compressibility curve. Beyond yielding the crushing increased abruptly. Among the natural materials analyzed, the lowest yield stress value occurs in the carbonate sand, and the highest in the silica sand.

40|$|Comminution {{test methods}} used within mineral {{processing}} have mainly {{been developed for}} selecting the most appropriate comminution technology for a given ore, designing a grinding circuit as well as sizing the equipment needed. Existing test methods usually require comparatively large sample amounts and are time-consuming to conduct. This makes comprehensive testing of ore comminution behavior – as required in the geometallurgical context – quite expensive. Currently the main interest {{in the conduct of}} comminution test lies in the determination of particle size reduction and related energy consumption by grindability test methods, which provide the necessary information about mill throughput. In this procedure mineral liberation is regarded as a fixed parameter due to missing this information in ore characterization as well as a lack of suitable comminution models. However, ignoring the connection between particle size and mineral liberation prevents the scheduling and controlling of the production process from being optimal. For these reasons new comminution tests need to be developed or alternatively the existing test methods need to be suited to geometallurgical testing where the aim is to map the variation of processing properties of an entire ore body. The objective of this research work is on the one hand to develop small-scale comminution test methods that allow linking comminution behavior and liberation characteristics to mineralogical parameters, {{and on the other hand}} establish a modeling framework including mineral liberation information. Within the first stage of the study the comminution of drill cores from Malmberget’s magnetite ore, classified by modal mineralogy and texture information, have been investigated. It was found that there is a direct correlation between the mechanical strength of the rock, as received from unconfined compressive or point load tests, and the crusher reduction ratio as a measure for <b>crushability.</b> However, a negative correlation was found between <b>crushability</b> and grindability for the same samples. The grindability showed inverse correlation with both magnetite grade and the magnetite’s mineral grain size. The preliminary conclusion is that modal mineralogy and micro-texture (grain size) can be used to quantitatively describe the ore comminution behavior although the applied fracture mechanism of the mill cannot be excluded. With crushed ore samples from Malmberget also grindability tests and mineral liberation analyses were conducted using laboratory tumbling mills of different size. Starting from the dimensions of the Bond ball mill a modified test method was developed where small size samples of approximately 220 g were pre-crushed and ground in a down-scaled one-stage grindability test. Down-scaling was done by keeping similar impact effects between the mills. Mill speed and grinding time were used for adjusting the number of fracture events in order to receive similar particle size distributions and specific grinding energy when decreasing mill size by the factor 1. 63. A detailed description of the novel geometallurgical comminution test (GCT) is given. With respect to ore <b>crushability</b> and autogenous and semiautogenous grinding (AG/SAG) also drop weight tests were conducted. For a more accurate and precise measurement of the energy transferred to the sample a novel instrumented drop weight was used. Initial tests with fractions of drill cores and pre-crushed ore particles showed that the simple energy calculation based on potential energy needs to be corrected. For the future work these tests will be extended to other ore types in order to investigate the effects of mineralogy and to include mineral liberation in comminution models suitable for geometallurgy.

The proportion of the cutting force to the depth of cutting is possible in any type of sandstone-like simulated material, which has been demonstrated by laboratory results. The correlation of the cutting force and the unconfined compressive strength of different rock scratching tests show that the simulations provide effective results.

In contrast, the footing on carbonate sand mobilised strains lower in magnitude over a greater depth. The increased stress level in the centrifuge reduced the surface heave and resulted in deeper failure mechanisms in both sands. The bearing capacity factor for the experimental results could be backcalculated with simple limit analysis solutions, provided that different friction angles were used to account for the variation of stress levels. However, such an approach masks the influence of compressibility on the failure mechanism in the loose and compressible cases by requiring a lower friction angle than is realistically possible.

40|$|As more {{advanced}} theoretical methods become available for {{solution of the}} complex cone penetration (CPT) boundary-value problem, {{it is essential to}} develop methods to validate those solutions experimentally. A large scale model penetrometer testing facility, consisting of a half-circular calibration chamber with digital image correlation (DIC) capability, was developed for experimental simulation of cone penetration. The flat side of the chamber is transparent, made of Plexiglass. In individual tests, sand samples are prepared inside the half-circular chamber by pluviation; the half-circular cone is then pushed into the sand model flush against the Plexiglas, with the penetration process digitally imaged for DIC analysis. The displacement data obtained from DIC analysis provided valuable insights into the cone penetration boundary-value problem. Experiments with three different types of silica sands show that sand <b>crushability</b> influences the slip pattern around the advancing cone and also the cone penetration resistance. The derived strain paths show that very complex modes of deformation are experienced by the soil elements in close proximity of the penetrometer tip. The close-up imagery of the interface zone provided useful information for understanding the model penetrometer-sand interface behavior. The series of cone penetration tests conducted in layered sand profiles show that the sensing and development depths are dependent upon the position of weak and strong layers with respect to the direction of the advancing cone. The observed influence zone as interpreted from DIC analysis is smaller than stated in the literature. ...|$|E
40|$|From a Quaternary science perspective, sand-sized quartz {{as well as}} silt-sized quartz {{is often}} {{acknowledged}} as final products of glacial abrasion through different evolution mechanisms. This view challenges the existence of any universal comminution process, which may relate the formation of detrital quartz sand and silt. The contribution of grain size, energy input, and crystalline integrity in the scale of quartz <b>crushability</b> {{has long been the}} matter of much debate. The present empirical work examines the micromechanics of sand-to-silt size reduction in the quartz material. A series of grinding experiments was performed on Leighton Buzzard Lower Greensand using a high-energy agate disc mill. Analogous conditions to glacial abrasion are provided due to the combined abrasion between grains' asperity tips, and also between grains and rotating smooth tungsten carbide pestle. Simulation of discontinuous grain breakage allowed the examination of grains' crystalline defects. To enable an objective assessment of micromechanics of size reduction, measurements of particle and mode size distribution, fractal indexes and micro-morphological signatures were made. The crushing approach was probed through varied grinding times at a constant energy input, as well as varied energy inputs at constant grinding time. Breakage pathway was inspected via laser diffraction spectroscopy and transmission light microscopy. Results suggested that the grain breakdown is not necessarily an energy-dependent process. Non-crystallographically pure (amorphous) quartz sand and silt are inherently breakable materials through a fractal breakdown process. Results also revealed that the internal defects in quartz are independent from size and energy input...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} granular materials {{is characterized by}} strong non-linearity and irreversibility. These properties have been differently described {{by a variety of}} constitutive models. To test any constitutive model, experimental data relative {{to the nature of the}} incremental stress-strain response of the material is desirable. However this type of laboratory data is scarce because of being expensive and difficult to obtain. The discrete element method has been used several times as an alternative to obtain incremental responses of granular materials. Crushable grains add one extra source of irreversibility to granular materials. <b>Crushability</b> has been variously incorporated into different constitutive models. Again, it will be helpful to obtain incremental responses of crushable granular materials to test these models, but the experimental difficulties are increased. Making use of a recently introduced crushing model for discrete element simulation, this paper presents a new procedure to obtain incremental responses in discrete analogues of granular crushable materials. The parallel probe approach, previously used for uncrushable discrete analogues, is here extended to account for the presence of crushable grains. The contribution of grain crushing to the incremental irreversible strain is identified and separately measured. Robustness of the proposed method is examined in detail, paying particular attention to aspects such as dynamic instability or crushing localization. The proposed procedure is later applied to map incremental responses of a discrete analogue of Fontainebleau sand on the triaxial plane. The effect of stress ratio and granular state on plastic flow characteristics is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} of fragmentation of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) by the Los Angeles test. The standard testing procedure for the Los Angeles index requires the measurement of the mass passing 1. 6 mm after 500 revolutions of the drum. Questions arise on {{the significance of this}} measure for RCA as the resistances of the mortar, of the original aggregate and of their interface simultaneously affect the measurement result. In order to clarify the interpretation of such a measure, three aspects were investigated: the influence of the number of revolutions, the evolution of the full particle size distribution and the distribution of mortar in the fractions after the test. The results suggested that the fracture mechanisms are similar between recycled and natural aggregates with some quantitative differences. RCA was less resistant to fragmentation and displayed a non linear evolution of mass passing 1. 6 mm with the number of revolutions. During fracture of RCA, mortar progressively accumulates in smaller fractions, with coarse fractions asymptotically behaving like natural aggregates. The analysis of the rate of breakage of the coarsest fraction appeared to be a richer indicator of <b>crushability</b> as a function of time and composition than the amount of the mass passing 1. 6 mm: its typical evolution allows estimating a rate of breakage which correlates well with indirect measures of composition (water absorption and density). The possible existence of an asymptote in the rate of breakage of the coarsest fraction suggests that {{it can be used to}} estimate at the same time the resistance of the recycled aggregate and of its original natural component, and probably give an estimate of the amount of mortar...|$|E
