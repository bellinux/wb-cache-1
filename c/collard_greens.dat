5|$|Cabbage (Brassica oleracea or B.oleracea var. capitata, var. tuba, var. sabauda or var. acephala) is {{a member}} of the genus Brassica and the mustard family, Brassicaceae. Several other cruciferous {{vegetables}} (sometimes known as cole crops) are considered cultivars of B.oleracea, including broccoli, <b>collard</b> <b>greens,</b> brussels sprouts, kohlrabi and sprouting broccoli. All of these developed from the wild cabbage B.oleracea var. oleracea, also called colewort or field cabbage. This original species evolved over thousands of years into those seen today, as selection resulted in cultivars having different characteristics, such as large heads for cabbage, large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for broccoli.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of <b>collard</b> <b>green</b> stalks as environmental enrichment on the behavior of cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) maintained in captivity. Sixteen birds were housed individually in cages and fed a commercial diet for parrots and seed mix, with water ad libitum during 12 days in climatic chamber with temperature and relative humidity simulating tropical conditions. The animals (n = 8) were divided into two groups, control and enriched, and the experimental period was divided into two phases (during and after enrichment) of four days each. The <b>collard</b> <b>green</b> stalks were used as enrichment only during the first period of the experiment, daily changed and maintained only during the day. The stalks increased the feed intake and decreased the sleep activities. No effect was observed on the body surface temperature, locomotion, maintenance and other resting activities. Small undesirable activities were detected. It was concluded that <b>collard</b> <b>green</b> stalks can be used as environmental enrichment, becoming part of food preferences of cockatiels.

40|$|O presente trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar o potencial de parasitismo e eficiência de E. formosa sobre B. tabaci biótipo B em couve, tomate e soja. O tempo de desenvolvimento de ovo a adulto e o número de ninfas de B. tabaci biótipo B foram avaliados em soja, tomate e couve. O número de ninfas parasitadas diariamente e o número total de ninfas parasitadas por fêmeas de E. formosa até sua morte foram avaliados para determinar a capacidade de parasitismo do parasitóide. Foram {{realizadas}} liberações de números variáveis de E. formosa para um número fixo de ninfas de B. tabaci biótipo B para avaliar o número ideal de parasitóides por planta. Através dos resultados obtidos, observou-se que a duração de ovo a adulto de B. tabaci biótipo B em tomate (22, 03 dias) foi estatisticamente superior a de soja (21, 17 dias) e esta última significativamente superior que em couve (19, 8 dias) sob as mesmas condições ambientais. O parasitóide E. formosa apresentou preferência por ovipositar no terceiro e quarto ínstares de seus hospedeiros. Comparando-se as três culturas avaliadas verifica-se que a couve apresentou número médio total de ninfas parasitadas superior aos valores obtidos para soja e tomate, que por sua vez não apresentaram diferença entre si. O parasitóide não apresentou diferença em relação à longevidade quando foram oferecidas ninfas de terceiro ou quarto ínstares nas culturas estudadas. Entretanto, verificou-se que para os dois estádios ninfais houve diferença significativa entre as culturas avaliadas. Na couve, a densidade de oito parasitóides por planta resultou em bom controle da praga. The potencial of parasitism and {{the efficiency}} of Encarsia formosa on Bemisia tabaci were evaluated on <b>collard</b> <b>green,</b> tomato and soybean plants. The period of developmentof B. tabaci biotype B from egg to adult {{and the number of}} nymphs were evaluated on those plants. The ability of parasitism was evaluated by the number of daily parasitized nymphs and the total number of parasitized nymphs per female of E. formosa. The ideal number of parasitoids per plant was evaluated by releasing variable numbers of E. formosa on a fixed number of B. tabaci biotype B nymphs. The results were as follows: the duration of the egg to adult period of B. tabaci biotype B on tomato (22, 03 days) was statistically superior to that on soybean (21, 17 days), while this last one was significantly superior to that on <b>collard</b> <b>green</b> (19, 8 days), under the same environmental conditions; the parasitoid showed preference to oviposit on the third and fourth instars of B. tabaci biotype B nymphs; the number of parasitized nymphs on <b>collard</b> <b>green</b> was higher than those observed on soybean and tomato, whereas the numbers on these last one did not differ; no difference was observed as to the parasitoid longevity when third and fourth instar nymphs were offered on the tested plants; however one observe {{a significant difference in the}} mean number of parasitized nymphs; on <b>collard</b> <b>green</b> plants eight parasitoids per plant resulted in a good control of this insect pest...|$|R

The potential for plant and animal uptake, metabolism, and propagation into food-chain poses great health risks. World communities face a common need to a cheap, efficient, and effective technology to mitigate the growing problem of heavy metal contaminations. The present investigation was undertaken to evaluate the potential of using aqueous extracts of edible vegetables and fruits for the in-situ remediation of lead contaminated water (1300 PPM). The plants {{used in this study}} include Mustard Green (Brassica juncea), Spinach (Spinacea oleracea), <b>Collard</b> <b>Green</b> (Brassica Oleracea), Bitter leaf (Vernonia Amygdalina), Carrot (Daucus Carota Sativus), Red, Green, and Yellow Bell Pepper (Capsicum Annuum), tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum), red and white grape (Vitis vinifera), and lime (Citrus aurantifolia). After shaking triplicate reaction mixtures lead contaminated water with each substrate for 22 hours at room temperature, lead removal by the substrates were analyzed by EPA Method 6010, using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES). Results suggest that the order of lead removal is <b>Collard</b> <b>Green</b> (99. 8 %) >, Spinach (98. 7 %) > Mustard Green (98. 2 %) > Green Bell Pepper (97. 8 %) > Yellow Bell Pepper (97. 75 %) > White Grape (96. 7 %) > Carrot (95. 5 %) > Red Bell Pepper (94. 28 %) > Red Grape > 93. 5 % > Tomatoes (84 %) > Bitter Leaf (61 %).

CareyA {{series of}} four {{investigations}} was conducted from 2005 to 2007 focusing on vegetable or high tunnel production. In {{the first study}} (chapters 1 & 2), the effect of high tunnels on soil quality was investigated. Grower perceptions of soil quality were assessed from 81 responses to a questionnaire. Indicators of soil quality were evaluated at two KSU research centers. Soil quality was then quantified in high tunnels and adjacent fields at 79 farms, where high tunnels {{ranged in age from}} two to fifteen years. Particulate organic carbon as a fraction of soil total carbon was used as an indicator of soil quality. At 80 % of locations, particulate organic matter carbon was greater under high tunnels than adjacent fields. Soil quality was not adversely affected by the continuous presence of high tunnel covering. Management and cropping history in high tunnels was also collected and reported as this information is of interest to growers and the universities and agricultural industries that serve them. Tomato was the most common high tunnel crop. It was grown by 86 % of survey respondents in the previous four year period. Organic soil amendments were applied by 89 % of growers; 35 % use organic soil amendments exclusively. In the second study (chapter 3), two microbial tea solutions were applied to <b>collard</b> <b>green</b> (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala cv. Top Bunch) or spinach (Spinacea oleracea L. cv.

However, since traditional-style cooking of soul food vegetables requires high temperatures or long time periods, the water-soluble vitamins (e.g., Vitamin C and the B complex vitamins) are either destroyed or leached out into the water in which it is cooked. Additionally, the high quantity of oils used in preparing such ingredients means the final product might contain only a small amount of vegetable relative to the total amount of calories per serving.
