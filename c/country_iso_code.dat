MLIF), and lexicons (ISO 24613).These {{standards are}} based on low level specifications dedicated to constants, namely data categories (revision of <b>ISO</b> 12620), language <b>codes</b> (<b>ISO</b> 639), scripts <b>codes</b> (<b>ISO</b> 15924), <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> (<b>ISO</b> 3166) and Unicode (ISO 10646).|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} tables {{attempt to}} provide {{a complete list of}} mobile network operators. <b>Country</b> information, including <b>ISO</b> 3166-1 <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> is provided for completeness. Mostly for historical reasons, one E.212 MCC may correspond to multiple <b>ISO</b> <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> (e.g. MCC 362 corresponds to BQ, CW, and SX). Some operators also choose to use an MCC outside the geographic area that it was assigned to (e.g. Digicel uses the Jamaica MCC throughout the Caribbean). ITU-T publishes an official list of mobile network codes {{from time to time in}} the Operational Bulletin. Unfortunately, the official list is often incomplete as national MNC Authorities do not forward changes to the ITU in a timely manner. The official list does not provide additional details such as bands and technologies and may not list disputed territories such as Abkhazia or Kosovo.|$|R

5000|$|The use of {{an initial}} letter [...] "X" [...] for these {{purposes}} is facilitated by the ISO 3166 rule that no official country code beginning with X will ever be assigned. Because of this rule ISO 4217 can use X codes without risk of clashing with a future <b>country</b> <b>code.</b> <b>ISO</b> 3166 <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> beginning with [...] "X" [...] are used for private custom use (reserved), never for official codes. For instance, the <b>ISO</b> 3166-based NATO <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> (STANAG 1059, 9th edition) use [...] "X" [...] codes for imaginary exercise countries ranging from XXB for [...] "Brownland" [...] to XXR for [...] "Redland", {{as well as for}} major commands such as XXE for SHAPE or XXS for SACLANT. Consequently, ISO 4217 can use [...] "X" [...] codes for non-country-specific currencies without risk of clashing with future country codes.|$|R

To support international/multivendor application, the 3-digit country code can contain an assigned <b>ISO</b> <b>country</b> <b>code</b> or a manufacturer code from 900 to 998 plus its identifying serial number. [...] In the United States, distribution of this type has been controversial. When 24PetWatch.com began distributing them in 2003 (and more famously Banfield Pet Hospitals in 2004) many shelter scanners couldn't read them. (Some still can't; asking local shelters about this is still a good idea.) At least one Banfield-chipped pet was inadvertently euthanized.|$|R
