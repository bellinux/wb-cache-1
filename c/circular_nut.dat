50|$|Because of {{construction}} tolerances, {{a means of}} adjustment, or regulation, of the action has to be provided. This is commonly done by having a threaded wire end on the wooden tracker rods. A <b>circular</b> <b>nut</b> varies the effective length of the tracker where it engages with {{other parts of the}} action. One objective of correct regulation is that the keys on each manual have the same rest height and distance of travel when pressed. The regulation wrongly set at one extreme can cause a note to sound when no keys are pressed. This may also be caused by the action sticking after the key is released. The other extreme is that notes do not sound, or sound feebly, when a key is pressed.|$|E

For example, Carroll Smith (Carroll Smith's Nuts, Bolts, Fasteners, and Plumbing Handbook) {{notes that the}} nylon insert is not damaged by installation and therefore they can be reused many times, and a Federal Aviation Administration Advisory <b>Circular</b> allows <b>nuts</b> to be reused if the prevailing torque is within specification. [...] However, an Air Force Technical Order requires replacement of self-locking nuts in critical areas. [...] Various specifications for aerospace-grade self-locking nuts require that the running torque be maintained {{after a number of}} cycles of assembly, but without preloading the fastener.|$|R
