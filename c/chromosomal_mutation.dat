25|$|In total, the {{mitochondrion}} hosts about 3000 {{different types}} of proteins, but only about 13 of them are coded on the mitochondrial DNA. Most of the 3000 types of proteins {{are involved in a}} variety of processes other than ATP production, such as porphyrin synthesis. Only about 3% of them code for ATP production proteins. This means most of the genetic information coding for the protein makeup of mitochondria is in chromosomal DNA and is involved in processes other than ATP synthesis. This increases the chances that a mutation that will affect a mitochondrion will occur in chromosomal DNA, which is inherited in a Mendelian pattern. Another result is that a <b>chromosomal</b> <b>mutation</b> will affect a specific tissue due to its specific needs, whether those may be high energy requirements or a need for the catabolism or anabolism of a specific neurotransmitter or nucleic acid. Because several copies of the mitochondrial genome are carried by each mitochondrion (2–10 in humans), mitochondrial mutations can be inherited maternally by mtDNA mutations which are present in mitochondria inside the oocyte before fertilization, or (as stated above) through mutations in the chromosomes.|$|E

50|$|Ewing’s Sarcoma is a {{bone cancer}} {{affecting}} mainly children and adolescents. Tumors of Ewing’ Sarcoma are typically {{found in the}} long bones of the legs and arms, or bones in the chest, trunk, pelvis, back, or head. Beckerle’s {{research in this area}} focuses on a key pathway as believed to be a mechanism by which the cancer cells can spread. Ewing sarcoma occurs due to a <b>chromosomal</b> <b>mutation</b> that causes an atypical protein, known as EWS/FLI, to be present (also called expressed), and that when EWS/FLI is expressed, literally thousands of genes are misregulated, leading to abnormal behavior. Beckerle’s lab found that the EWS/FLI protein disrupted cell adhesion and limited the ability of cells to remain in their normal environment. The EWS/FLI protein is difficult to regulate so Beckerle’s team is focused on an essential regulating protein called ysine specific demethylase (LSD1). Preliminary research has aimed to halt the function of LSD1 {{to prevent the spread of}} Ewing Sarcoma cells.|$|E

30|$|All Enterobacteriaceae are {{naturally}} susceptible to quinolones and fluoroquinolones. High-level resistance emerges after successive <b>chromosomal</b> <b>mutations</b> in the DNA gyrase- and topoisomerase IV-encoding genes (gyrA and parC, respectively), each mutation causing {{a rise in}} the MICs [84]. Thus, strains with a single mutation can appear susceptible to fluoroquinolones but highly resistant to quinolones [53]. This phenotype may ease the emergence of mutants with high-level fluoroquinolone resistance under fluoroquinolone monotherapy, especially when the bacterial inoculum is high [85]. <b>Chromosomal</b> <b>mutations</b> may also lead to decreased permeability or overexpression of efflux pumps, resulting in reduced susceptibility. Besides mutations, plasmid-encoded resistance has emerged in the 2000 s with Qnr (A, B, C, D and S subtypes), a small DNA-mimicking protein that confers low-level fluoroquinolone resistance [86], AAC(6 ′)-Ib-cr, an AME for which two mutations extend the resistance spectrum to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin [87], and the QepA efflux pump [88]. It is noteworthy that these plasmid-borne determinants of fluoroquinolone resistance are frequently associated with ESBL [89].|$|R
40|$|Multidrug-resistant {{bacteria}} arise {{mostly by}} {{the accumulation of}} plasmids and <b>chromosomal</b> <b>mutations.</b> Typically, these resistant determinants are costly to the bacterial cell.

This implies that the acquisition of an additional resistance plasmid or of a resistance mutation often increases the fitness of a bacterial strain already resistant to antibiotics.

40|$|The {{transmission}} of plasmid pCU 1 (or other IncN group plasmid) into {{a population of}} Klebsiella oxytoca cells reduces {{the viability of the}} population. A 2, 400 -bp region adjacent to traA is responsible for this phenotype and includes two regions, called kikA and kikC. Klebsiella cells which received this region and survived were found to acquire a <b>chromosomal</b> <b>mutation</b> which renders them immune to killing even after the plasmid is cured from the cells. To obtain insight into the mode of this apparent lethality, an appropriate pCU 1 lacZ derivative was constructed. It could be introduced with high efficiency into Klebsiella cells. Analyses of the resultant colonies indicate that the loss of viability is not a consequence of the death of plasmid-free segregants. On the contrary and unlike postsegregational killing by plasmids, cells survived by losing the plasmid or by acquiring, secondarily, a <b>chromosomal</b> <b>mutation</b> which confers immunity to killing. All conjugative antibiotic resistance plasmids of the incom-patibility group N of gram-negative bacteria confer on their hosts a phenotype called Kik 1.

40|$|Several {{microbial}} {{systems have}} been shown to yield advantageous mutations in slowly growing or nongrowing cultures. In one assay system, the stationary-phase mutation mechanism differs from growth-dependent mutation, demonstrating that the two are different processes. This system assays reversion of a lac frameshift allele on an F′ plasmid in Escherichia coli. The stationary-phase mutation mechanism at lac requires recombination proteins of the RecBCD double-strand-break repair system and the inducible error-prone DNA polymerase IV, and the mutations are mostly − 1 deletions in small mononucleotide repeats. This mutation mechanism is proposed to occur by DNA polymerase errors made during replication primed by recombinational double-strand-break repair. It has been suggested that this mechanism is confined to the F plasmid. However, the cells that acquire the adaptive mutations show hypermutation of unrelated chromosomal genes, suggesting that chromosomal sites also might experience recombination protein-dependent stationary-phase mutation. Here we test directly whether the stationary-phase mutations in the bacterial chromosome also occur via a recombination protein- and pol IV-dependent mechanism. We describe an assay for <b>chromosomal</b> <b>mutation</b> in cells carrying the F′ lac. We show that the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>mutation</b> is recombination protein- and pol IV-dependent and also is associated with general hypermutation.
