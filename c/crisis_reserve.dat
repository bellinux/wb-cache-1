40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the recent global crisis on emerging market economies (EMs). Our cross-country analysis shows that {{the impact of the}} crisis was more pronounced in those EMs that had initial weaker fundamentals and greater financial and trade linkages. This effect is observed along a number of dimensions, such as growth, stock market performance, sovereign spreads, and credit growth. This paper also shows that during this crisis, pre-crisis reserve holdings helped to mitigate the initial growth collapse. This finding contrasts with other studies that fail to find a significant relationship between reserves and the growth decline. This paper argues that our preferred measure of impact is a more accurate reflection of the true impact of the crisis on EMs. Emerging markets;Credit;Economic growth;Economic recession;Global Financial Crisis 2008 - 2009;Sovereign debt;pre-crisis, current account, external debt, short-term debt, credit booms, external financing, financial crisis, banking crises, reserve holdings, current account deficit, recession, current account balance, public debt, recessions, currency crises, public sector debt, external liabilities, financial integration, current account deficits, financial crises, early warning system, global economic crisis, systemic financial crisis, global recession, economic <b>crisis,</b> <b>reserve</b> countries, short term debt, post-crisis period, liquidity injection, global recessions, corporate sector, crisis probabilities, country comparison, capital account crisis, bank liquidity, credit boom, reserve holding, private credit, asian crisis, private banks, pre - crisis, external public sector debt, crisis episodes, global financial <b>crisis,</b> <b>reserve</b> accumulation...|$|E

40|$|With {{the use of}} nontraditional policy tools, {{the level}} of reserve {{balances}} has risen significantly in the United States since 2007. Before the financial <b>crisis,</b> <b>reserve</b> balances were roughly $ 20 billion whereas the level has risen well past $ 1 trillion. The effect of reserve balances in simple macroeconomic models often comes through the money multiplier, affecting the money supply {{and the amount of}} bank lending in the economy. Most models currently used for macroeconomic policy analysis, however, either exclude money or model money demand as entirely endogenous, thus precluding any causal role for reserves and money. Nevertheless, some academic research and many textbooks continue to use the money multiplier concept in discussions of money. We explore the institutional structure of the transmission mechanism beginning with open market operations through to money and loans. We then undertake empirical analysis of the relationship among reserve balances, money, and bank lending. We use aggregate as well as bank-level data in a VAR framework and document that the mechanism does not work through the standard multiplier model or the bank lending channel. In particular, if the level of reserve balances is expected {{to have an impact on}} the economy, it seems unlikely that a standard multiplier story will explain the effect. Bank reserves...|$|E

Following {{the recent}} financial <b>crisis,</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements {{have become a}} policy instrument preferred in many emerging markets such as China, Brazil and Turkey for various purposes. Therefore, the formulating a theoretical framework to study the policy effectiveness remains an important issue. In this thesis, I develop a DSGE model with the financial accelerator mechanism so as to see the effectiveness of reserve requirement in small open economies, especially in influencing the external imbalances. External imbalances can either be interpreted as current account imbalances or its mirroring capital account imbalances. The main channel through which the external balances play a role is via the banking sector, which is modelled as engaging in international borrowing. This framework allows examination of {{the responses of the}} external imbalances to shocks to the reserve requirement ratio As a result, higher reserve requirements make domestic borrowing cheaper than foreign borrowing and by this way, changes in net foreign liabilities create a current account surplus. Thus, a country with current account deficit can use reserve requirements to readjust its external imbalances. Dalkıran, Dilşat TugbaM. S...|$|E

This paper seeks an answer by constructing the equilibrium real exchange rate, using an error correction model and a technique developed by Gonzalo and Granger (1995). The results are affirmative and the evidence indicates that current account deficits and investor confidence also played significant roles in the sharp exchange rate depreciation. The ECM model is supported by superior out-of-sample forecast performance versus a random walk model.

The main results from the theoretical model of the ECCB''s institutional arrangement are that the majority of currency union members may veto emergency lending {{in the case of a}} member-specific shock, as such lending may endanger the stability of the currency board (by lowering the central bank''s international reserves, thus raising devaluation risk). However, in the presence of contagion across countries, all currency union members have a vested interest in liquidity supply from the central bank. A key policy recommendation is that currency union members need a stronger fiscal position to continue to access international financial markets and sustain the exchange rate peg.

We conclude that {{a high degree of}} currency substitution argues for a more fixed exchange rate regime, while asset substitution may imply that either more rigid or more flexible regimes may be appropriate. We also ask whether the most informative monetary aggregates include dollar assets. Based on an analysis of five countries, we conclude inter alia that broader aggregates that include dollar assets perform better than those that do not.

40|$|What might {{interest}} rate liberalization do to intermediation {{and the cost}} of capital in China? China''s most binding {{interest rate}} control is a ceiling on the deposit rate, although lending rates are also regulated. Through case studies and model-based simulations, we find that liberalization will likely result in higher interest rates, discourage marginal investment, improve the effectiveness of intermediation and monetary transmission, and enhance the financial access of underserved sectors. This can occur without any major disruption. International experience suggests, however, that achieving these benefits without unnecessary instability, requires vigilant supervision, governance, and monetary policy, and a flexible policy toolkit.

50|$|Reserves {{are used}} as savings for {{potential}} times of crises, especially balance of payments crises. Original fears {{were related to the}} current account, but this gradually changed to also include financial account needs. Furthermore, the creation of the IMF was viewed {{as a response to the}} need of countries to accumulate reserves. If a specific country is suffering from a balance of payments crisis, it would be able to borrow from the IMF. However, the process of obtaining resources from the Fund is not automatic, which can cause problematic delays especially when markets are stressed. Therefore, the fund only serves as a provider of resources for longer term adjustments. Also, when the crisis is generalized, the resources of the IMF could prove insufficient. After the 2008 crisis, the members of the Fund had to approve a capital increase, since its resources were strained. Moreover, after the 1997 Asian <b>crisis,</b> <b>reserves</b> in Asian countries increased because of doubt in the IMF reserves. Also, during the 2008 <b>crisis,</b> the Federal <b>Reserve</b> instituted currency swap lines with several countries, alleviating liquidity pressures in dollars, thus reducing the need to use reserves.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} draw {{lessons from the}} IMF’s {{experience}} in handling financial crises around the globe {{over the past ten}} years that are relevant to the challenges faced by countries in Latin America, especially in the wake of the recent crisis in Argentina. Experience suggests that there is no quick or easy fix in the face of a wide-ranging crisis involving both acute external financing pressures and rapidly changing asset prices that undermine financial stability and household and corporate balance sheets. In the end, effective solutions depend on developing a comprehensive strategy combining the full range of fiscal, monetary, financial system, and debt policy instruments. Recent experience with crises has had important implications for the IMF’s work in assessing crisis vulnerabilities. IMF surveillance work has been strengthened and a more objective framework has been developed for assessing debt sustainability, and this approach continues to be refined.

40|$|After {{widening}} {{substantially in}} the period preceding the global financial crisis, current account imbalances across the world have contracted to a significant extent. This paper analyzes the factors underlying this process of external adjustment. It finds that countries whose pre-crisis current account balances were in excess {{of what could be}} explained by economic fundamentals have experienced the largest contractions in their external balance. External adjustment in deficit countries was achieved primarily through demand compression, rather than expenditure switching. Changes in other investment flows were the main channel of financial account adjustment, with official external assistance and ECB liquidity cushioning the exit of private capital flows for some countries.

40|$|India’s {{reserves}} {{have been}} growing since the external reforms of 1991 - 2 and 1992 - 3. There was a minor interruption after the Asian crises as India borrowed money abroad through the mechanism of the Resurgent India Bonds (RIBs), at a relatively high rate of interest. The pace of reserve accumulation has picked up since then with an addition of $ 25 billion to reserves in 2002 - 3. Reserve accumulation {{can be part of}} a deliberate move to build up reserves as it was in 1991 - 92 and in 1992 - 93 after reserves had sunk to one month of import during the BOP <b>crises.</b> <b>Reserves</b> can also be the outcome of exchange rate management of new developments on the external sector. For instance, an unprecedented $ 6 billion of FII inflow came in over a 12 month period from October 1993 to September 1994. This unprecedented inflow {{was the result of the}} opening of the economy to equity flows coupled with market reforms and represented a stock adjustment of the global equity portfolio. Reserves accumulated during this period because of a deliberate decision to curb appreciation of the rupee through RBI purchase of excess inflows. An earlier ICRIER paper argued that this was part of an assymmetric exchange rate management policy that was more benign towards depreciation of the rupee in response to adverse polic...|$|R
