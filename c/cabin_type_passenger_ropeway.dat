50|$|The first {{recorded}} mechanical ropeway was by Croatian Fausto Veranzio who designed a bicable <b>passenger</b> <b>ropeway</b> in 1616.The world's first cable car on multiple supports {{was built by}} Adam Wybe in Gdańsk, Poland in 1644.

50|$|An {{elevated}} <b>passenger</b> <b>ropeway,</b> or chairlift, {{is a type}} of aerial lift, {{which consists}} of a continuously circulating steel cable loop strung between two end terminals and usually over intermediate towers, carrying a series of chairs. They are the primary onhill transport at most ski areas (in such cases referred to as 'skilifts'), but are also found at amusement parks, various tourist attractions, and increasingly in urban transport.|$|R
50|$|The rope is the {{defining}} characteristic of an elevated <b>passenger</b> <b>ropeway.</b> The rope stretches and contracts as the tension exerted upon it increases and decreases, and it bends and flexes as it passes over sheaves and around the bullwheels. The fibre core contains a lubricant which protects the rope from corrosion and also allows for smooth flexing operation. The rope must be regularly lubricated to ensure safe operation and long life.|$|R
50|$|The first {{recorded}} mechanical ropeway was by Venetian Fausto Veranzio who designed a bicable <b>passenger</b> <b>ropeway</b> in 1616. The industry generally considers Dutchman Adam Wybe to have {{built the first}} operational system in 1644. The technology, which was further developed by {{the people living in}} the Alpine regions of Europe, progressed rapidly and expanded due to the advent of wire rope and electric drive. World War I motivated extensive use of military tramways for warfare between Italy and Austria.|$|R

30|$|The task of {{the optimal}} design of aerial <b>passenger</b> <b>ropeway</b> for the {{conditions}} of a highly urbanized environment and high irregularity of the earth’s surface {{is a very complex}} mathematical task. Indeed, with the distances between neighboring stations for boarding passengers, which are characteristic of ropeway lines, the number of variable parameters in the optimization problem can reach up to 100 unknown values. The number of these unknown quantities determines the dimension of the optimization problem. At the same time, it is also necessary to take into account 11 types of various structural, strength and operational constraints, which should be imposed on variables during the solution of the optimization problem. These constraints are expressed using 99 mathematical dependencies in the form of inequalities. Thus, the practical implementation of the proposed mathematical model and the problem of minimizing the objective function (Eq.  1) are possible only through the use of numerical mathematical methods and computer equipment.|$|R

30|$|Aerial ropeway is an {{effective}} alternative to the conventional modes of land public transport in metropolitan areas and cities. Construction of <b>passenger</b> aerial <b>ropeways</b> in urban environment is a very costly enterprise in terms of engineering and economics, and requires significant financial resources. This article is aimed at {{the development of the}} design method of the <b>passenger</b> aerial <b>ropeway,</b> ensuring the reduction in its construction cost. For this purpose, the individual components of the construction cost are considered, and the approximate calculation dependencies are proposed. It is shown that the cost of the aerial ropeway is mainly influenced by the installation step, height of intermediate towers and carrying rope tension. The task of the conditional nonlinear optimization of the given parameters is formulated and solved in the research. This task ensures the minimum cost of the aerial ropeway. The optimization task is done by taking into account possible limitations on the ropeway laying in the severely urbanized environment (the terrain, urban infrastructure arrangement, altitude performance of the urban development, technical characteristics of the carrying rope, etc.). Implementing the solution findings of the given optimization task makes it possible to significantly reduce the construction cost of aerial ropeways in urban environment.|$|R
30|$|It {{is clear}} that the {{arrangement}} of the intermediate towers of the ropeway is the task of technical and economic optimization. The aim of optimization is to provide the minimum cost of the erection of boarding stations, intermediate towers, procurement of hauling and carrying cables and the set of technological equipment installed on the tower [24]. Statement and solving of the optimization problem make it possible to substantially reduce the costs of construction of <b>passenger</b> aerial <b>ropeways</b> in the urbanized environment [2, 25].|$|R
