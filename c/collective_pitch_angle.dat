Variables studied included <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle,</b> flapping-hinge offset, rotor angle of attack, and tip-speed ratio. The results show that the blade periodic bending moments generally increase with tip-speed ratio up into the transition region, diminish over a certain range of tip-speed ratio, and increase again at higher tip-speed ratios. Above the transition region, the bending moments increase with <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle</b> and rotor angle of attack. The absence of a flapping hinge results in a significant amplification of the periodic bending moments, the magnitudes of which increase with tip-speed ratio. When the flapping hinge is used, an increase in flapping-hinge offset results in reduced period bending moments. The aforementioned trends exhibited by the bending moments for changes in the variables are essentially duplicated by the periodic flapping motions. The existence of substantial amounts of blade stall increased both the periodic bending moments and the flapping angles. Harmonic analysis of the bending moments shows significant contributions of the higher harmonics, particularly in the transition region...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{concentrates}} on the aeroelasticity analysis of rotor blade and rotor control systems. A new multi-body dynamics model is established to predict both rotor pitch link loads and swashplate servo loads. Two helicopter rotors of UH- 60 A and SA 349 / 2, both operating in two critical flight conditions, high-speed flight and high-thrust flight, are studied. The analysis shows good agreements with the flight test data and the calculation results using CAMRAD II. The mechanisms of rotor control loads are then analyzed in details based on the present predictions and the flight test data. In high-speed conditions, the pitch link loads are dominated by the integral of blade pitching moments, which are generated by cyclic pitch control. In high-thrust conditions, the positive pitching loads in the advancing side are caused by high <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle,</b> and dynamic stall in the retreating side excites high-frequency responses.

PIV measurements have been performed at different Z-planes distributed at different distance downstream the rotor (in the wake region between the rotor and the wing and above the fixed wing) in both the conversion and cruise flight configurations and for different parametric conditions of the rotor shaft angle (b), the blade rotational frequency (f), the upstream velocity (U 8), the advancing parameter (m=U 8 / 2 pfR) and the <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle</b> value (q). For these different parametric conditions the tip vortex path and the associated 3 C velocity field shed from the blade have been determined {{in the early stages of}} the tip vortex shedding corresponding to 3 azimuth positions (y= 1 °, 2 °, 5 °) and in a fixed downstream plane located at Z/R= 0. The XY-plots of the velocity vector clearly show the flow perturbation generated by the blade passage and th...|$|E
50|$|The <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> control, or <b>collective</b> lever, is {{normally}} {{located on the}} left side of the pilot's seat with an adjustable friction control to prevent inadvertent movement. The <b>collective</b> changes the <b>pitch</b> <b>angle</b> of all the main rotor blades collectively (i.e., all at the same time) and independent of their position. Therefore, if a collective input is made, all the blades change equally, and as a result, the helicopter increases or decreases its total lift derived from the rotor. In level flight this would cause a climb or descent, while with the helicopter pitched forward an increase in total lift would produce an acceleration together with a given amount of ascent.|$|R
40|$|The {{constant}} need {{to improve}} helicopter performance requires the optimization of existing and future rotor designs. A crucial indicator of rotor capability is hover performance, which depends on the near-body flow {{as well as the}} structure and strength of the tip vortices formed at the trailing edge of the blades. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers must balance computational expenses with preservation of the flow, and to limit computational expenses the mesh is often coarsened in the outer regions of the computational domain. This can lead to degradation of the vortex structures which compose the rotor wake. The current work conducts three-dimensional simulations using OVERTURNS, a three-dimensional structured grid solver that models the flow field using the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The S- 76 rotor in hover was chosen as the test case for evaluating the OVERTURNS solver, focusing on methods to better preserve the rotor wake. Using the hover condition, various computational domains, spatial schemes, and boundary conditions were tested. Furthermore, a mesh adaption routine was implemented, allowing for the increased refinement of the mesh in areas of turbulent flow without the need to add points to the mesh. The adapted mesh was employed to conduct a sweep of <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angles,</b> comparing the resolved wake and integrated forces to existing computational and experimental results. The integrated thrust values saw very close agreement across all tested <b>pitch</b> <b>angles,</b> while the power was slightly over predicted, resulting in under prediction of the Figure of Merit. Meanwhile, the tip vortices have been preserved for multiple blade passages, indicating an improvement in vortex preservation when compared with previous work. Finally, further results from a single <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> case were presented to provide a more complete picture of the solver results...|$|R
40|$|An isolated, {{hingeless}} rotor with discrete flap and lead-lag flexures {{and relatively}} rigid blades was {{tested in the}} Aeroflightdynamics Directorate's 7 - by 10 -Foot Wind Tunnel. The lead-lag stability of a structurally simple rotor configuration in forward flight was determined. The model tested had no cyclic pitch control, and was therefore operated untrimmed at several <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angles,</b> at shaft angles from 0 deg to - 20 deg, and at advance ratios as high as 0. 55. Two inplane natural frequencies, 0. 61 /rev and 0. 72 /rev, were tested for configuration both with and without structural flap lag coupling. Concomitant hover testing of the model was also conducted. Representative plots of the frequency and damping data are presented to show general trends, and complete tabular data and model properties information are included for use in detailed correlation exercises. The most prominent feature of the forward flight data is an abrupt increase in damping with advance ratio at certain high-speed, high shaft-angle conditions, with high flapping loads. The hover data are consistent with previous experimental and theoretical results for hingeless rotors without kinematic couplings. Overall, the data quality is very good and the data {{are expected to be}} useful in the development and validation of rotor aeroelastic stability analyses...|$|R
