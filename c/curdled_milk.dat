Sadza is also commonly eaten with <b>curdled</b> <b>milk</b> (sour milk), {{commonly known as}} [...] "lacto" [...] (mukaka wakakora), or dried Tanganyika sardine, known locally as kapenta or matemba. Bota is a thinner porridge, cooked without the additional cornmeal and usually flavoured with peanut butter, milk, butter, or jam. Bota is usually eaten for breakfast.|$|E

From {{childhood}} Sembène was exposed to Serer religion especially the Tuur festival, {{in which he was}} made cult servant. Although the Tuur demands offerings of <b>curdled</b> <b>milk</b> to the ancestral spirits (Pangool), Sembène did not take his responsibility as cult servant seriously and was known for drinking the offerings made to the ancestors.

2500|$|Country dwellers drank milk ( [...] gala), but it {{was seldom}} used in cooking. Butter ( [...] bouturon) was known but seldom used either: Greeks {{saw it as a}} [...] culinary trait of the Thracians of the {{northern}} Aegean coast, whom the Middle Comic poet Anaxandrides dubbed [...] "butter eaters". Yet Greeks enjoyed other dairy products. [...] pyriatē and Oxygala (...) were <b>curdled</b> <b>milk</b> products, similar to cottage cheese or perhaps to yogurt. Most of all, goat's and ewe's cheese ( [...] tyros) was a staple food. Fresh and hard cheese were sold in different shops; the former cost about two thirds of the latter's price.|$|E

40|$|By {{studying}} various {{reactions of}} anti-rennet serum and anticasein serum serologically {{as well as}} influences of these anti-sera on the <b>curdling</b> of <b>milk</b> by rennet, the author obtained the following results. 1) With the use of either anti-rennet serum or anti-casein serum, it has been possible to induce passive anaphylaxis in guinea pigs. 2) Anti-rennet serum has inhibited the <b>curdling</b> of <b>milk</b> by rennet. 3) The time required for <b>curdling</b> <b>milk</b> by rennet {{has been found to}} be slightly lengthened when the milk is priorly treated by anti-casein serum...|$|R

60|$|Here, at {{the foot}} of a remarkable, {{isolated}} column of rock, on which I was destined to see a strange sight in the after days, we halted and ate of the remaining food which we had brought with us, while the Amahagger consumed their own, that seemed to consist largely of <b>curdled</b> <b>milk,</b> such as the Zulus call maas, and lumps of a kind of bread.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I {{went in and}} saw Magepa's wives, {{old women}} all of them. Also, at his bidding, his daughter, whose name was Gita, brought me some maas, or <b>curdled</b> <b>milk,</b> to drink. She was a well-formed woman, very like her father, but sad-faced, perhaps with a prescience of evil to come. Clinging to her finger was a {{beautiful}} boy of something under two years of age, who, when he saw Magepa, ran to him and threw his little arms about his legs.

60|$|So we {{went out}} into the garden where the tall, impassive ladies were {{arranging}} many wooden dishes on the ground. Now the moon was clear of clouds, and by its brilliant light we examined their contents. Some were cooked meat covered with a kind of sauce that made its nature indistinguishable. As a matter of fact, I believe it was mutton, but--who could say? Others were evidently of a vegetable nature. For instance, there was a whole platter full of roasted mealie cobs and a great boiled pumpkin, to say nothing of some bowls of <b>curdled</b> <b>milk.</b> Regarding this feast I became aware of a sudden and complete conversion to those principles of vegetarianism which Brother John was always preaching to me.|$|E
5000|$|The Greek word Galium means [...] "milk" [...] this meaning {{suggest that}} Galium obtusum {{may have been}} a plant that was used in the process of <b>curdling</b> <b>milk.</b> Some people even use this flower as decoration, but its {{popularity}} as an ornamental is low.|$|R
50|$|Channer shondesh {{is created}} with milk and sugar. (Bengali: সন্দেশ). Some recipes {{call for the}} use of chhena or paneer (which is made by <b>curdling</b> <b>milk</b> and {{separating}} the whey from it) instead of milk itself. Chhanar mishti is made from chickpea flour with sugar/jaggery/molasses. Various types are available across Bangladesh.|$|R
50|$|This {{cheese is}} one of several that are made by <b>curdling</b> <b>milk</b> and {{separating}} the curds from the whey. Pressed into moulds, Rochebaron is then pierced with wires impregnated with Penicillium glaucum to produce blue veins through the soft whitish body of the cheese.

60|$|Leaving them {{in charge}} of two old women, I went to see to Anscombe, who as yet could not do much for himself, also to the outspanning of the horses which were put into a cattle kraal, where they lay down at once without {{attempting}} to eat the green forage which was given to them. After this I gave our goods into the charge of the kraal-head, a nice old fellow whom I had never met before, and he led Anscombe to another hut close to that where the women were. Here we drank some maas, that is <b>curdled</b> <b>milk,</b> ate a little mutton, though we were too fatigued to be very hungry, and stripping off our wet clothes, threw them out into the sun to dry.|$|E
60|$|We were {{side by side}} {{again at}} supper, and what a change was there! She was like <b>curdled</b> <b>milk</b> to me; her face was like a wooden doll's; I could have indifferently smitten her or grovelled at her feet, but she gave me not the least {{occasion}} to do either. No sooner the meal done than she betook herself to attend on Mrs. Gebbie, which I think {{she had a little}} neglected heretofore. But she was {{to make up for lost}} time, and in what remained of the passage was extraordinary assiduous with the old lady, and on deck began to make a great deal more than I thought wise of Captain Sang. Not but what the captain seemed a worthy, fatherly man; but I hated to behold her in the least familiarity with any one except myself.|$|E
6000|$|Soon we marched again, for Goza {{would not}} allow me to ride the horse, fearing that I should escape on it. Nor would he let me carry either of the guns lest I should make use of them. All day we travelled, {{reaching}} the Nongoma heights in the late afternoon. On this beautiful spot we found a kraal situated where afterwards a magistracy was built when we conquered the country, whence there {{is one of the}} finest views in Zululand. There was no one in the kraal except two old women who appeared to be deaf and dumb for all I could get out of them. These aged dames, however, or others who were hidden, had made ready for our arrival, since a calf lay skinned and prepared for cooking, and by it big gourds filled with Kaffir beer and [...] "maas" [...] or <b>curdled</b> <b>milk.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Butterworts {{also produce}} a strong {{bactericide}} which prevents insects from rotting {{while they are}} being digested. According to Linnaeus, this property {{has long been known}} by northern Europeans, who applied butterwort leaves to the sores of cattle to promote healing.

50|$|The {{village of}} Burträsk (now {{part of the}} Skellefteå municipality) claims Västerbotten cheese was invented there in the 1870s, {{supposedly}} by a dairy maid, Eleonora Lindström. According to legend, she was left alone to stir the curd of a traditional cheese but was interrupted, either by other chores or an assignation with her lover. This resulted in alternating periods of heating and stirring of the <b>curdling</b> <b>milk.</b>|$|R
50|$|La Chimoltrufia (Florinda Meza), born María Expropiación Petronila Lascuráin y Torquemada de Botija, is {{the wife}} of Botija. She has broom-like hair and works as a hotel maid. She has an {{extremely}} roundabout manner of expressing herself, {{a strong sense of}} justice, and a singing voice that could <b>curdle</b> <b>milk.</b> She is also quick to resort to physical violence against others who she thinks are doing her wrong.|$|R
60|$|Towards sundown {{they came}} to a kraal set upon a hill, and it was asked of her if she were pleased to spend the night there. She bowed her head in assent, and they entered the kraal. It was quite empty save for certain maidens dressed in bead petticoats, who waited there to serve her. All the other {{inhabitants}} had gone. They took her to a large and beautifully clean hut. Kneeling on their knees, the maidens presented her with food--meat and <b>curdled</b> <b>milk,</b> and roasted cobs of corn. She ate of the corn and the milk, but the meat she sent away as a gift to the captains. Then alone in that kraal, in which after they had served her even the girls seemed to fear to stay, Rachel slept as best she might in such solitude, while without the fence two thousand armed savages watched over her safety.|$|E
6000|$|... "How do you do, sir?" [...] Ishmael jerked out at last. [...] "You are {{an early}} visitor, and find me {{somewhat}} unprepared. If I {{had known that}} you were coming I would"--then suddenly he remembered his attire, {{or the lack of}} it, also his companion who was leaning on his shoulder, and peeping at the white man over it. Drawing the kaross tightly about him, he gave the poor girl a backward kick, and with a Kaffir oath bade her begone, then went on hurriedly: [...] "I am afraid my dress is not quite what you are accustomed to, but among these poor heathens I find it necessary to conform more or less to their ways in order to gain their confidence and--um--affection. Will you come into the hut? My servant there will get you some tywala (Kaffir beer)--I mean some amasi (<b>curdled</b> <b>milk)</b> at once, and I will have a calf killed for breakfast." ...|$|E
60|$|In another {{portion of}} the square, {{provisions}} and stock, alive and dead, were being offered for sale, {{for the most part}} by natives of the country. Here were piles of vegetables and fruits grown in the gardens, sacks of various sorts of grain, bundles of green forage from the irrigated lands without the walls, calabashes full of <b>curdled</b> <b>milk,</b> thick native beer and trusses of reed for thatching. Here again were oxen, mules and asses, or great bucks such as we now know as eland or kudoo, carried in on rough litters of boughs to be disposed of by parties of savage huntsmen who had shot them with arrows or trapped them in pitfalls. Every Eastern tribe and nation seemed to be represented in the motley crowd. Yonder stalked savages, naked except for their girdles, and armed with huge spears, who gazed with bewilderment on the wonders of this mart of the white man; there moved grave, long-bearded Arab merchants or Phoenicians in their pointed caps, or bare-headed white-robed Egyptians, or half-bred mercenaries clad in mail. Their variety was without end, while from them came a very babel of different tongues as they cried their wares, bargained and quarrelled.|$|E
50|$|The Myrtle-nymphs {{taught him}} useful arts and mysteries, how to <b>curdle</b> <b>milk</b> for cheese, how {{to tame the}} Goddess's bees and keep them in hives, and how to tame the wild {{oleaster}} {{in order to make}} it bear olives. Thus he became the patron god of cattle, fruit trees, hunting, husbandry, and bee-keeping. He also taught to humans the dairy skills (including cheesemaking), as well as the use of nets and traps in hunting.|$|R
50|$|The nomadic Ngisonyoka {{people in}} the Turkana District of Kenya use Vachellia reficiens wood to build {{temporary}} houses. In Namibia's Kaokoveld region, the branches of this tree are used for fencing and the bark is used to <b>curdle</b> <b>milk,</b> while the thorns {{can be used to}} pierce ears. The seeds can be baked in hot ash, crushed, ground and mixed with tobacco to use as snuff. The Giriama people use the wood for firewood and charcoal, and straight stems for poles.|$|R
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. First, the father's semen curdles the mother's menses, which Aristotle compares with how rennet (an enzyme from a cow's stomach) <b>curdles</b> <b>milk</b> in cheesemaking. This forms the embryo; {{it is then}} {{developed}} {{by the action of}} the pneuma (literally, breath or spirit) in the semen. The pneuma first makes the heart appear; this is vital, as the heart nourishes all other organs. Aristotle observed that the heart is the first organ seen to be active (beating) in a hen's egg. The pneuma then makes the other organs develop.|$|R
60|$|Thrusting aside these {{thoughts}} she rose. On the table stood <b>curdled</b> <b>milk</b> and other food {{of which she}} forced herself to eat, that her strength might return to her, for she knew that she would need it all. Then she washed and dressed herself, for {{in a corner of the}} hut was water in wooden bowls, and even a comb and other things, that apparently had been set there for her to use. This done, she went to the door, which was made like that of a house, and finding that it was not secured, opened it and looked out. Beyond was a piece of ground floored with the soil taken from ant-heaps, and polished black after the native fashion. This space was surrounded by a high stone wall, and had at the end of it another very strong door. In its centre grew a large, shady tree under which was placed a bench. Taking the assegai with her she went to the door in the high wall and found that it was barred on the further side. Then she returned and sat down on the bench under the tree.|$|E

[...] he would say. [...] "Here is my Flint-worker!" [...] He would come leaping, tail in air; he would roll; he would lay his head between his paws out of merriness of heart at his warm, waiting meal. He would leap--and, oh, his eye in mid-leap when he saw--when he saw the knife held ready for him! It pierced his hide as a rush pierces <b>curdled</b> <b>milk.</b> Often he had no time to howl. I did not trouble to flay any beasts I killed. Sometimes I missed my blow. Then I took my little flint hammer and beat out his brains as he cowered. He made no fight. He knew the Knife!

Then I walked as a man should--the Master of The Beast! ...|$|E

[...] But I said, [...] "I must show my people how to use their knives against The Beast, as you showed me how to use my knife." [...] I said this because the Magic Knife does not balance like the flint. She said, [...] "What you have done, you have done {{for the sake of a}} woman, and not for the sake of your people." [...] I asked of her, [...] "Then why did the God accept my right eye, and why are you so angry?" [...] She answered, [...] "Because any man can lie to a God, but no man can lie to a woman. And I am not angry with you. I am only very sorrowful for you. Wait a little, and you will see out of your one eye why I am sorry." [...] So she hid herself.|$|E
