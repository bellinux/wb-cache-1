5|$|Cadw {{carried out}} a major {{restoration}} project on the house over the next 42 months, combining large scale conservation with detailed surveying and archaeological analysis. The 19th-century Victoria Galley was demolished in 1995, and the bare, external stonework was re-rendered and lime washed. Large parts of the property were restored as they might have appeared in 1665, assisted by the record of Robert Wynn the younger's will, {{with the exception of}} the attic, which was restored to its probable 19th-century appearance. The intention of this was to emphasize the colour and <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original building, to prevent it appearing inauthentically bleak and austere. Other sections of the house were redeveloped to hold exhibition displays and other visitor facilities.|$|E
5|$|They found {{albatross}} chicks {{and seals}} to eat, {{but despite the}} relative <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island compared to the small boat, they still urgently needed to reach the whaling station at Husvik {{on the other side}} of the island to fetch help for the men on Elephant Island. It was clear that McNish and Vincent could not continue, so Shackleton left them in the care of Timothy McCarthy camped in the upturned James Caird, and with Worsley and Crean made the hazardous trip over the mountains. McNish took screws from the James Caird and attached them to the boots of the men making the journey to help them grip the ice. He also fashioned a crude sledge from driftwood he found on the beach, but it proved too clumsy to be practical. When Shackleton's party set off on 18 May 1916, McNish accompanied them for a few hundred yards but he was unable to go any further. He shook hands with each of the men, wished them good luck and then Shackleton sent him back. Putting McNish in command of the remaining men, Shackleton charged him to wait for relief and if none had come by the end of winter to attempt to sail to the east coast. Once Shackleton's party had crossed the mountains and arrived in Husvik, he sent Worsley with one of the whaler's ships, Samson, to pick up McNish and the other men. After seeing the emaciated and drawn McNish on his arrival at the whaling station, Shackleton recorded that he felt that the rescue had come just in time for him.|$|E

25|$|The {{basic design}} of the earlier, conical version of the helmet was {{intended}} to direct blows from weapons downward {{and away from the}} skull and face of the wearer. Later versions of the bascinet, especially the great bascinet, were designed to maximise coverage and therefore protection. In achieving this they sacrificed the mobility and <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wearer; thus, ironically, returning to the situation that the wearers of the cumbersome great helm experienced and that the early bascinets were designed to overcome. It is thought that poorer men-at-arms continued to employ lighter bascinets with mail camails long after the richest had adopted plate gorgets.|$|E

25|$|The {{moisture}} given off by {{the human}} body, even when not exercising and sweating, will condense against {{the inside of the}} dry duit, and the way this condensate is handled by the underwear material will influence the <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diver. If the underwear soaks up this moisture it will feel cold and clammy, particularly if this layer is against the skin. Materials which wick the moisture away from the skin and do not soak up the condensate will be more comfortable. Early thermal undersuits for drysuits were commonly made from wool, as it retains its insulating properties better when wet than most other natural fibres.|$|E

25|$|Empathy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of humanistic therapy. This idea focuses on the therapist’s ability to see the world through the eyes of the client. Without this, therapists can be forced to apply an external frame of reference where the therapist is no longer understanding the actions and thoughts of the client as the client would, but strictly as a therapist which defeats the purpose of humanistic therapy. Included in empathizing, unconditional positive regard {{is one of the}} key elements of humanistic psychology. Unconditional positive regard refers to the care that the therapist needs to have for the client. This ensures that the therapist does not become the authority figure in the relationship allowing for a more open flow of information as well as a kinder relationship between the two. A therapist practicing humanistic therapy needs to show a willingness to listen and ensure the <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patient where genuine feelings may be shared but are not forced upon someone. Marshall Rosenberg, one of Carl Rogers' students, emphasizes empathy in the relationship in his concept of Nonviolent Communication.|$|E

25|$|Ancient Egyptians, {{like many}} cultures, {{believed}} in an afterlife {{and much of}} what remains of their civilization reflects this because only the temples, tombs and other religious structures survive well. One belief {{that was at the}} center of Egyptian beliefs about life after death was the belief in the ka. The ka was believed by the Egyptians to be ones' life source, essence, and soul. Egyptians believed that after they died, their ka would continue to live as they had lived on earth in the afterlife. It would enjoy the same activities the individual had enjoyed on earth. Egyptians also believed that the ka had to have a body to return to, and because of this belief they would mummify their dead. Egyptians also took precautionary measures, in case their body did not survive, by commissioning ka statues; statues of the deceased that were buried in the tomb, along with the body, and would serve as a replacement if the body decayed beyond recognition. It was especially important to ensure the <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king's ka in the afterlife, due to his prominent position both in politics, and religion.|$|E
