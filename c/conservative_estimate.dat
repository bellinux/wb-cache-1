5|$|In the United States, {{the storm}} wrought {{extensive}} damage along the Gulf Coast. At least 371 {{people were killed}} by the storm; however, this is considered a <b>conservative</b> <b>estimate</b> and the true death toll may never be known. Of the known fatalities, 353 took place in Louisiana and 18 in Mississippi. This makes the 1909 Grand Isle hurricane the eleventh deadliest hurricane in United States history. However, {{at the time of its}} occurrence, it was the sixth deadliest storm in the country. Damage throughout Louisiana and Mississippi was estimated to be at least $10million (1909USD).|$|E
5|$|German {{casualty}} {{figures are}} less complete {{than those of}} the Allies, and official figures have never been released. A signal possibly sent by II SS Panzer Corps on 27 September listed 3,300 casualties (1,300 killed and 2,000 injured) around Arnhem and Oosterbeek. Robert Kershaw's assessment of the incomplete records identified at least 2,500 casualties. In the Roll of Honour: Battle of Arnhem 17–26 September 1944, J.A. Hey of the Society of Friends of the Airborne Museum, Oosterbeek identified 1,725 German dead from the Arnhem area relating to the time of the battle. All of these figures are significantly higher than Model's <b>conservative</b> <b>estimate</b> of 3,300 casualties for the entire Market Garden area of battle (which included Eindhoven and Nijmegen).|$|E

5|$|In July 2017, a {{study by}} William Sellers et al., {{published}} in the journal PeerJ found that an adult Tyrannosaurus was incapable of running due to very high skeletal loads. The study used the latest computing technology to test its findings. The researchers used two different structural mechanical systems to create the computer model. The weight they settled on for their calculations was a <b>conservative</b> <b>estimate</b> of 7 tons. The model showed that speeds above 11mph (18km/h) would have probably shattered the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus. The finding may mean that running was also not possible for other giant theropod dinosaurs like Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus and Acrocanthosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} people counted in the census of 1381 was 59,873,305; however, this number dropped {{significantly}} when the government found that some 3 million people were missing from the tax census of 1391. Even though underreporting figures was made a capital crime in 1381, the need for survival pushed many to abandon the tax registration and wander from their region, where Hongwu had attempted to impose rigid immobility on the populace. The government tried to mitigate this by creating their own <b>conservative</b> <b>estimate</b> of 60,545,812 people in 1393. In his Studies on the Population of China, Ho Ping-ti suggests revising the 1393 census to 65 million people, noting that large areas of North China and frontier areas were not counted in that census. Brook states that the population figures gathered in the official censuses after 1393 ranged between 51 and 62 million, while the population was in fact increasing. Even the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–505) remarked that the daily increase in subjects coincided with the daily dwindling amount of registered civilians and soldiers. William Atwell states that around 1400 the population of China was perhaps 90 million people, citing Heijdra and Mote.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar's varied fauna and flora are {{endangered}} by human activity. Since {{the arrival of}} humans around 2,350years ago, Madagascar has lost more than 90percent of its original forest. This forest loss is largely fueled by tavy ("fat"), a traditional slash-and-burn agricultural practice imported to Madagascar by the earliest settlers. Malagasy farmers embrace and perpetuate the practice {{not only for its}} practical benefits as an agricultural technique, but for its cultural associations with prosperity, health and venerated ancestral custom (fomba malagasy). As human population density rose on the island, deforestation accelerated beginning around 1400 years ago. By the 16th century, the central highlands had been largely cleared of their original forests. More recent contributors to the loss of forest cover include the growth in cattle herd size since their introduction around 1000 years ago, a continued reliance on charcoal as a fuel for cooking, and the increased prominence of coffee as a cash crop over the past century. According to a <b>conservative</b> <b>estimate,</b> about 40percent of the island's original forest cover was lost from the 1950s to 2000, with a thinning of remaining forest areas by 80percent. In addition to traditional agricultural practice, wildlife conservation is challenged by the illicit harvesting of protected forests, as well as the state-sanctioned harvesting of precious woods within national parks. Although banned by then-President Marc Ravalomanana from 2000 to 2009, the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re-authorized in January 2009 and dramatically intensified under the administration of Andry Rajoelina as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following Ravalomanana's ousting.|$|E

25|$|For {{the period}} from 1994 to 2003, {{estimates}} ranged from 50,000 to 250,000 civilians and 10,000 to 50,000 Russian servicemen killed. Given that almost certainly both sides have tended to exaggerate enemy military casualties while minimizing their own and grossly underestimating its responsibility for civilian losses, the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society set the <b>conservative</b> <b>estimate</b> of death toll in this time period at about 150,000 - 200,000 civilians, 20,000 to 40,000 Russian soldiers, and possibly {{the same amount of}} Chechen rebels.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of X-rays stimulated a veritable sensation. Röntgen's biographer Otto Glasser estimated that, in 1896 alone, {{as many as}} 49 essays and 1044 articles about the new rays were published. This was probably a <b>conservative</b> <b>estimate,</b> if one considers that nearly every paper around the world extensively reported about the new discovery, with a magazine such as Science dedicating as many as 23 articles to it in that year alone. Sensationalist reactions to the new discovery included publications linking the new kind of rays to occult and paranormal theories, such as telepathy.|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} {{behavior and}} the ultimate punching shear resistance of internal reinforced concrete flat slab-column connections, with one hole adjacent to the column, with or without flexural moment transfer of the slab to the column was investigated. Main variables were: the existence whether or not hole, flexural reinforcement layout and ratio, the direction and sense of the moment transferred and the eccentricity of the load (M (moment transferred to column) / V (shear)) ratio at the connection - 0, 50 m or 0, 25 m. Seven internal slab-column joining were tested and ultimate loads, cracking, deflections, concrete and reinforcement strains were analyzed. The existence of hole adjacent to the smaller column dimension, the hole dimension, flexural reinforcement rate and placing, the variation of relation Mu/Vu in function of the load, and, than, of eccentricity of the load, influenced the slabs behavior and rupture load. Test results were compared with the estimations from CEB-FIP/MC 1990 &# 91; 7 &# 93;, EC 2 / 2004 &# 91; 12 &# 93;, ACI- 318 : 2011 &# 91; 1 &# 93; and NBR 6118 : 2007 &# 91; 5 &# 93;.

25|$|The first survey {{published}} on 29 October 2004, estimated 98,000 excess Iraqi deaths (with {{a range of}} 8,000 to 194,000, using a 95% confidence interval (CI)) from the 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq to that time, or about 50% higher than the death rate prior to the invasion. The authors described this as a <b>conservative</b> <b>estimate,</b> because it excluded the extreme statistical outlier data from Fallujah. If the Fallujah cluster were included, the mortality estimate would increase to 150% over pre-invasion rates (95% CI: 1.6 to 4.2).|$|E

40|$|The Industrial Hygiene {{office is}} tasked with {{identifying}} health hazards and implementing programs to protect employees at NASA Armstrong {{as outlined in}} NPR 1800. 1. Common health hazards at the center include noise, oxygen depletion, ionizing radiation, and non-ionizing radiation. Two methods are utilized for analyzing hazards: computation and surveying. Industrial hygienists employ computational methods to check their survey results, to analyze hazards where measurement is impossible, and to analyze future scenarios. Theoretical calculations provide hazard distances for industrial hygienists to avoid harmful radiation when surveying radio frequency (RF) instruments. The process of finding hazard distances for RF instruments is tedious and prone to simple computation mistakes due to the complex nature of near field and far field power density calculations for differing types of RF emitters,. To increase efficiency and accuracy of instrument analysis, a radio frequency hazard distance calculator was created. This calculator references the IEEE 95. 3 guidelines for theoretical calculations of exposure fields from RF instruments. In order to keep Armstrong employees safe, the calculator selects for <b>conservative</b> <b>estimates</b> of RF hazards. These <b>conservative</b> <b>estimates</b> were verified by surveying instruments to measure actual power density. The RF hazard distance calculator efficiently produced reasonable and <b>conservative</b> <b>estimates</b> of power densities {{for a variety of}} RF emitters...|$|R
