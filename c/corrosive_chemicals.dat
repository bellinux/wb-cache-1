25|$|Its high {{corrosion}} resistance makes PTFE useful in laboratory environments, {{where it is}} used for lining containers, as a coating for magnetic stirrers, and as tubing for highly <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemicals</b> such as hydrofluoric acid, which will dissolve glass containers. It is used in containers for storing fluoroantimonic acid, a superacid.|$|E
25|$|Activated {{charcoal}} is {{the treatment}} of choice to prevent poison absorption. It is usually administered when the patient is {{in the emergency room}} or by a trained emergency healthcare provider such as a Paramedic or EMT. However, charcoal is ineffective against metals such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, and alcohols and glycols; it is also not recommended for ingestion of <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemicals</b> such as acids and alkalis.|$|E
25|$|PTFE {{is used as}} a {{non-stick}} coating for pans and other cookware. It is non-reactive, partly because of the strength of carbon–fluorine bonds, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Where used as a lubricant, PTFE reduces friction, wear and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions. Also, it is frequently employed as coating on catheters; this interferes with the ability of bacteria and other infectious agents to adhere to catheters and cause hospital-acquired infections.|$|E

25|$|Specific pretreatments, {{drugs to}} prevent {{chemically}} induced lung injuries due to respiratory airway toxins, are not available. Analgesic medications, oxygen, humidification, and ventilator support currently constitute standard therapy. In fact, mechanical ventilation remains the therapeutic mainstay for acute inhalation injury. The cornerstone of treatment {{is to keep}} the PaO2 > 60 mmHg (8.0 kPa), without causing injury to the lungs with excessive O2 or volutrauma. Pressure control ventilation is more versatile than volume control, although breaths should be volume limited, to prevent stretch injury to the alveoli. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is used in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS to improve oxygenation. Hemorrhaging, signifying substantial damage to the lining of the airways and lungs, can occur with exposure to highly <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemicals</b> and may require additional medical interventions. Corticosteroids are sometimes administered, and bronchodilators to treat bronchospasms. Drugs that reduce the inflammatory response, promote healing of tissues, and prevent the onset of pulmonary edema or secondary inflammation may be used following severe injury to prevent chronic scarring and airway narrowing.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{reduction}} in mercury in 1996, alkaline batteries are allowed to be disposed of as regular domestic waste in some locations. However, older alkaline batteries with mercury, and the remaining other heavy metals and <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemicals</b> in all batteries (new and old), still present problems for disposal—especially in landfills. [...] There is also the issue of simplifying the disposal of batteries to exclude them all so that the most toxic will be diverted from general waste streams.|$|E

5000|$|Chemical milling or {{industrial}} etching is the subtractive manufacturing process of using baths of temperature-regulated etching chemicals to remove material {{to create an}} object with the desired shape. [...] It is mostly used on metals, though other materials are increasingly important. It was developed from armor-decorating and printing etching processes developed during the Renaissance as alternatives to engraving on metal. The process essentially involves bathing the cutting areas in a <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemical</b> known as an etchant, which reacts with the material {{in the area to}} be cut and causes the solid material to be dissolved; inert substances known as maskants are used to protect specific areas of the material as resists.|$|R
5000|$|The {{presence}} of iron, nickel, copper, and cobalt strongly activates corrosion. Greater than {{a very small}} percentage, these metals precipitate as intermetallic compounds, and the precipitate locales function as active cathodic sites that reduce water, causing the loss of magnesium. [...] Controlling the quantity of these metals improves corrosion resistance. Sufficient manganese overcomes the corrosive effects of iron. This requires precise control over composition, increasing costs. Adding a cathodic poison captures atomic hydrogen within {{the structure of a}} metal. This prevents the formation of free hydrogen gas, an essential factor of <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemical</b> processes. The addition of about one in three hundred parts arsenic reduces its corrosion rate in a salt solution by a factor of nearly ten.|$|R
40|$|Coatings with {{outstanding}} {{chemical and}} physical properties {{can be obtained}} from two-pack formulations without stoving. The epoxy resin was cured with different amine-based compounds, such as polyamide (PA), the aniline copolymer of triethanolamine titanate and aniline formaldehyde. The thermal resistance properties of the cured films were analysed using the thermo-gravimetric method. This study also examined the effect of coating resistance of 3 per cent sodium chloride solution by means of electrochemical impedance measurements. Coatings that included the epoxy triethanolamine titanate showed superior behaviour, compared to the other two systems tested. This hardener can be recommended instead of using conventional PA and polyamidoamide hardeners for epoxy two-pack systems that are to be used to protect the steel structures from highly <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemical</b> and marine environment...|$|R

50|$|Vascular {{corrosion}} casting {{requires the}} use of a solidifying material such as a resin. The most common resin used for vascular corrosion casting is Batson's 17. The process begins with the draining of blood from vessels to prevent blockage from clotting, this can be achieved by perfusing blood vessels with a physiological fluid such as phosphate buffered saline. Subsequently, the blood vessels of interest are filled with resin (or alternate solidifying material). The resin is allowed to cure resulting in the blood vessel network containing a solid plastic material. Surrounding tissue is dissolved away using a <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemical,</b> commonly potassium hydroxide. Corrosion should not affect the resin, only dissolving tissue. The final product is a 3D network of blood vessels.|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{material}} processing operations present numerous challenges for effective automation. Confined spaces, hazardous materials and processes, particulate contamination, radiation sources, and <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemical</b> operations {{are but a}} few of the significant hazards. However, automated systems represent a significant safety advance when deployed in place of manual tasks performed by human workers. The replacement of manual operations with automated systems has been desirable for nearly 40 years, yet only recently are automated systems becoming increasingly common for nuclear materials handling applications. This paper reviews several automation systems which are deployed or about to be deployed at Los Alamos National Laboratory for nuclear material handling operations. Highlighted are the current social and technological challenges faced in deploying automated systems into hazardous material handling environments and the opportunities for future innovations...|$|R

50|$|The process uses an {{abrasive}} and <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemical</b> slurry (commonly a colloid) {{in conjunction}} with a polishing pad and retaining ring, typically of a greater diameter than the wafer. The pad and wafer are pressed together by a dynamic polishing head and held in place by a plastic retaining ring. The dynamic polishing head is rotated with different axes of rotation (i.e., not concentric). This removes material and tends to even out any irregular topography, making the wafer flat or planar. This may be necessary to set up the wafer for the formation of additional circuit elements. For example, CMP can bring the entire surface within the depth of field of a photolithography system, or selectively remove material based on its position. Typical depth-of-field requirements are down to Angstrom levels for the latest 22 nm technology.|$|R

50|$|Corrosion {{occurs in}} various forms in the {{refining}} process, such as pitting corrosion from water droplets, embrittlement from hydrogen, and stress corrosion cracking from sulfide attack. From a materials standpoint, carbon steel is used for upwards of 80 per cent of refinery components, which is beneficial due to its low cost. Carbon steel is resistant to the most common forms of corrosion, particularly from hydrocarbon impurities at temperatures below 205 °C, but other <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemicals</b> and environments prevent its use everywhere. Common replacement materials are low alloy steels containing chromium and molybdenum, with stainless steels containing more chromium dealing with more corrosive environments. More expensive materials commonly used are nickel, titanium, and copper alloys. These are primarily saved for the most problematic areas where extremely high temperatures and/or very <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemicals</b> are present.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{obstacles}} hindering the acceptance of polymer composites in civil en-gineering applications is the susceptibility of the polymeric matrix: to degradation that is initiated by moisture, temperature, and <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemical</b> environments. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize chemical and physical changes in polymer matrix resins following exposure to these environments. Resin systems studied were vinyl ester and isophthalic polyester, both of which are proposed for use in construction applications. Unreinforced free films were exposed to water, al-kaline and saline environments at ambient and elevated temperatures for extended periods of time. Changes in strength and thermophysical properties were evaluated through tensile testing. dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). Chemical degradation of the polymers was character-ized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.

This project focuses on providing a cost effective method for the abatement of Fluoride. Fluorine is a toxic and <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemical</b> with a threshold limit value (TLV) of 1 ppm. The present method utilizes fluidized bed reactor using red-mud as bed material thereby utilizing wastes of aluminium industry. This also provides a simple alternative to Fluoride abatement while producing no hazardous waste. The fluidization characteristics of red-mud were studied. The ratio of red mud and alumina particles required to be used as the bed material was also determined by experimentation. This method of Fluoride abatement is most effective as wastes of Al- industry is used to minimise another problem thereby reducing the operating cost of the Al- industry...|$|R
40|$|Epoxy resins {{are used}} as {{high-performance}} thermosetting linings to protect substrates under corrosive environments. However, in a severe <b>corrosive</b> <b>chemical</b> solution, such protective layers may degrade with long time due to penetrations of solvent and solute molecules into resin network. In this regard, the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a promising tool for non-destructive evaluation of the penetrant amounts due to high transparency of such plastic materials and high sensitivity to the molecular vibrations in terahertz spectral range. In this work, the complex refractive indexes n and κ of epoxy specimens were measured after immersion into sulfuric acid solutions and compared with penetrated mass fractions of water and acid ions. It was found that n and κ depended linearly with water and sulfuric acid mass fraction in specimens, and κ of sulfuric acid immersed specimens was lager at higher frequency. While the calculated Δκ agreed well with THz-TDS measurement by THz-TDS, the calculated Δn was higher than the measurement. The difference {{may be attributed to}} the water and sulfuric states in the specimen...|$|R
