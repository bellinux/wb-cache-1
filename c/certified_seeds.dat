5000|$|Dry bean is {{an ancient}} crop, first domesticated over 7000 years ago and is still a staple crop globally.

In all of these nations, anthracnose {{is considered one of}} the most invasive and destructive dry bean diseases, capable of destroying up to 95% of a plantation's yield while also threatening growth and development rates. As such, it is very important for producers to have disease-free <b>certified</b> <b>seeds,</b> which are generally produced in arid regions such as Idaho, where the relative humidity does not surpass the necessary 92% for spore germination. Further precaution is often taken by producers, who apply fungicides such as Azoxystrobin, fluodiooxonil or metalaxyl-m.

50|$|Some {{chemical}} ways {{to manage}} nematodes, especially in peach, are fumigation, and nematicides. Pre-plant fumigation {{should be used}} in areas that are none to be infected with nematodes, or more susceptible to ring nematode infestation. Nematicides can be used to help combat ring nematodes as well. Studies have found that both pre- plant, and post-plant nematicides have been able to manage ring nematodes, especially in peach species that are susceptible to bacterial canker and peach short tree life disease. Some non-chemical ways to control or manage ring nematodes are crop rotations, soil sanitation, and cultural practices such as removing plant debris, planting <b>certified</b> <b>seeds,</b> and the use of antagonistic cover crops. These are plants that release chemical compounds into the soil that are toxic to the nematodes. Host resistance to ring nematode has been hard to find. In order to control Mesocriconema xenoplax, the eggs that are laid by females would need to be eliminated. The nematodes overwinter and survive as eggs, so getting rid of them would help control ring nematodes.|$|E

The low level of use of certificated wheat seed in farms is associated with many factors, such as price of the seed (cost), yield gains and suitability of the varieties for the farming aims of producers. Average productivity is 49. 5 % and average net profit is 39. 7 % higher in the production of wheat with certificated seeds of improved varieties in farms in comparison to farming with traditional varieties. Average productivity in wheat production with uncertified seeds of improved varieties is 24. 9 % and net profit per unit area is 24. 3 % higher than wheat production with traditional varieties. The net economic benefit of wheat production using certificated seeds of improved varieties and that of wheat farming with uncertified seeds has been estimated at $ 102. 40 and $ 62. 70 ha - 1, respectively. Some $ 6. 4 benefit is generated in return for $ 1 of expense in wheat farming with certificated seeds of improved varieties instead of traditional varieties. In the absence of state subsidies for certificated seeds the use of uncertified seeds seems to be advantageous for producers. While the amount of subsidy per hectare will be a minimum of $ 101 for certificated seeds per hectare of planting area (as technological improvement), the support will be encouraging for usage of <b>certified</b> <b>seeds.</b> Many variables, such as farm size, use of <b>certified</b> <b>seeds,</b> topography of land, production system, education level and frequency of visiting the agriculture organizations of the producers influence the level of gross profit per unit area in wheat farming.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{structure}} and performance of the sorghum and millet seed sector in Mali. The Sahel is the origin of pearl millet and sorghum, seed selection and management of these crops is embedded in local cultures, and most producers of these crops are subsistence oriented. Despite seed sector reform, no <b>certified</b> <b>seed</b> of these crops is sold in local markets and farmers prefer to rely on themselves or each other for seed. The dominant source of <b>certified</b> <b>seed</b> is the national <b>seed</b> service. <b>Certified</b> <b>seed</b> is multiplied by contracted farmers and seed producer groups, and supplied to farmers through farmers' associations, development organizations, and extension services. The informal sector supplies farmers with non-certified seed directly and indirectly through village grain markets. There is no consensus about whether it is lack of effective demand or supply that constrains farmer use of certified sorghum and millet seed, but researchers generally conclude {{that the process of}} <b>certifying</b> <b>seed</b> is too lengthy, some mechanism must be established for production and trade of locally-adapted landraces, and Mali's highly structured farmers' associations could play an even stronger role in testing and promoting demand for <b>certified</b> <b>seed.</b> Recommendations have included the use of small packs and seed auctions where market infrastructure is sparse, and in more commercialized areas, involvement of agro-input dealers, shopkeepers and traders.

40|$|Purpose. To {{define the}} level of impact of such factors as rate, time and methods of sowing on seed {{productivity}} and <b>certified</b> <b>seeds,</b> and the individual response of winter wheat varieties to these factors if used the ecological system of seed farming, that would allow to form and obtain genetically determined potential of variety productivity. Methods. Weight measurement for determining seed yield; statistical, variance and regression analysis for identifying the reliabi­lity of the experiment results. Results. During the research period, weather conditions were greatly differed both by temperature regime and precipitation, but stability of grain and seeds yield {{on an annual basis}} was the main requirement to varieties. During the study of «grain productivity» value and quantitative indices of winter wheat yield structure, the results from 684 plots were obtained which were grouped and analyzed for impact factors for complete certainty, and NIR 0, 05 was calculated. Conclusions. Thus, in case of shifting sowing time from optimum to later period, efficiency of water use by plants was decreasing to a greater extent during years with insufficient precipitation. The shift of sowing time to later period providing optimal seeding rate and row seeding method did not reduce yield. The yield of winter wheat varieties to be studied when sowing in usual manner with seeding rate of 5, 5 million seeds/ha in the period from September 15 and October 5 was the highest. Varieties ‘Slavna’ and ‘Chorniava’ provided the highest grain productivity for seeding rate of 5, 5 million seeds/ha and using row seeding method, with slight impact of sowing time factor. Grain yield of studied varieties showed negative response during the experiment when seeding rate decreased up to 2, 5 – 3, 0 million seeds/ha. ‘Astarta’ varie­ty provided the highest productivity for <b>certified</b> <b>seeds</b> yield as compared to the control (from 1, 59 to 3, 38 t/ha). The variant of the experiment when sowing on October, 5 in usual manner with seeding rate of 5, 5 million seeds/ha showed the highest productivity of 7, 02 t/ha (+ 3, 38 t/ha, or + 92, 9 %). Shifting of sowing time for October, 5 resulted in a significant decrease in yields of <b>certified</b> <b>seeds</b> as compared to sowing time on September 15 and 25. Seed yield of studied varieties when sowing on October, 5 was higher than in case of sowing on September, 25.
