25|$|Amazon state {{sales tax}} <b>collection</b> <b>policy</b> {{has changed over}} the years since in the company's {{beginning}} it did not collect any sale taxes. In the U.S., state and local sales taxes are levied by state and local governments, not at the federal level. In most countries where Amazon operates, a sales tax or value added tax is uniform throughout the country, and Amazon is obliged to collect it from all customers. Proponents of forcing Amazon.com to collect sales tax—at least in states where it maintains a physical presence—argue the corporation wields an anti-competitive advantage over storefront businesses forced to collect sales tax.|$|E

25|$|The museum can be {{allocated}} {{material from the}} railway industry by the Railway Heritage Committee. Because {{of the diversity of}} material falling potentially within the museum's <b>collection</b> <b>policy</b> and the problems of caring for it, decisions on acquisition of new items for the collection can be difficult. Previously the museum has treated rolling stock as if it were effectively still in railway service and capable of undergoing repeated heavy repairs and restoration. Since being preserved many of the museum's locomotives have operated on the main line, heritage railways or at the museum. More recently, there have been moves to less interventionist forms of conservation in some cases leading to some exhibits becoming non-operational.|$|E
25|$|At the {{instigation}} of Christian Friedrich Schönbein, the Voluntary Museum Association of Basel (Freiwilliger Museumsverein) {{was initiated}} in 1850 as {{the successor to}} an earlier association founded in 1841 {{for the construction of}} the museum. Modelled after the Royal Institution in London, it was established to “stimulate the appreciation of science and art”. Open to all residents of Basel, the association promoted the collections with financial means and sought to generate interest in the museum through public lectures to which women were also admitted. It was unable to sustain the initial enthusiasm, however, and experienced losses in membership despite Basel’s rapid population growth {{in the latter half of}} the century. The museum did not embrace the function of popular education that had been promoted by its founders and supporters. The ideational socialization role of the museum was very slow to proceed, with the museum long holding onto former organizational structures. The art collection furthermore did not get an academically trained conservator until 1887. In addition, the renewed University Act of 1866 discontinued regular state appropriations for the antiquarian, medieval and art collections and left them dependent on proceeds from entry fees and the support of associations and private individuals, the most significant of these being the Birrmann Foundation and the Emilie Linder Foundation on behalf of the art collection. It was this support that enabled an active <b>collection</b> <b>policy</b> that went beyond the receipt of inherited cultural assets.|$|E

40|$|South African policymakers are {{challenged}} by the limited resources that can be consulted {{in the field of}} tax policy proposals that address the needs of the public. Despite the importance of studying tax history as a reference for modern tax systems, decisions regarding current tax <b>collection</b> <b>policies</b> in South Africa have not been informed by effective historical policies. It is imperative that historical tax policies be studied to identify tax policies that produced the desired or intended results, which could then serve as a benchmark for South African tax <b>collection</b> <b>policies.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the current South African tax <b>collection</b> <b>policies</b> with efficacious tax <b>collection</b> <b>policies</b> implemented in ancient China, Egypt, Greece and Rome. Both similarities and differences between the ancient policies and current policies were found and possible improvements that could contribute to optimising the effectiveness of South African tax legislation were highlighted. The research conducted for the purpose of this study confirmed that similarities exist between current tax <b>collection</b> <b>policies</b> implemented in South Africa and those implemented in ancient civilizations. One particular improvement that South Africa could adopt is to revise the policy relating to the progressive tax system to ensure that all South African citizens, irrespective of their ability to pay, contribute, as was the case in Ancient Egypt. Processes could be implemented to hold the government accountable for the responsible and transparent spending of tax revenue according to the tax budget, as applied by the ancient Romans. It was also determined that the policies regarding tax refunds should be applied by SARS in terms of the relevant legislation and in the pursuance of a fair and stable tax system. By adopting any of the efficient tax <b>collection</b> <b>policies</b> of antiquity, South Africa could initiate steps to optimise the effectiveness of the tax system.

40|$|The sixties were a time {{of social}} movements, public debates and {{changing}} perspectives. It was the time that in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde new ideas about its collecting practice came up. But only {{little is known about}} the collecting practice and <b>collections</b> <b>policy</b> of the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde in the 1960 ’s. This Master thesis was written to find out what these looked like. Research questions were: was there a <b>collections</b> <b>policy</b> in the sixties in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde? What did it look like? And is this <b>collections</b> <b>policy</b> reflected in the actual acquisitions, especially from Middle- and South-America? Three methods were used for collecting data: the jaarverslagen (annual reports), correspondence between the museum and the collectors and TMS (The Museum System, the museum’s collections database). A database was set up to combine information from TMS with that of the jaarverslagen. This database showed the total amount of objects given to and collected for and by the museum per year. The jaarverslagen, written by director Pott, proved to useful in understanding the difficulties in forming a new <b>collections</b> <b>policy.</b> The jaarverslagen also show the need to collect but this was not always possible due to financial problems. The correspondence between the museum and the collectors gave a good insight in the collecting practice. It can be concluded that there was no actual <b>collections</b> <b>policy</b> present in the sixties. The collecting practice very much depended on personal preferences of the director and the curators. However, there were some common ideas about collecting in the museum. One of them was that objects from ‘unknown’ cultures should be collected but in a way that visitors could identify with them. This can be clearly seen in the Borys Malkin and Luis Laffer collections. Also the idea of ‘saving’ parts of cultures before they disappeared is part of these common ideas. Malkin was one of the collectors that worked with this so-called ‘salvage anthropology’. Pott’s ideas about the <b>collections</b> <b>policy</b> are not very different from the collecting practice. His ideas are clearly visible in the collecting practice and this can lead to the conclusion that Pott was well aware of the difficulties and possibilities of the collecting practice...|$|R

5000|$|Written as a {{subsection}} of {{the overarching}} collection management policy, most collectors and cultural institutions utilize a collections policy, or selection criteria policy, {{in which it}} is outlined what purpose the collection serves, and the types of objects that are considered most relevant. The <b>collection</b> <b>policy</b> lays out the scope of the collection and its relevance to the institution's mission statement by serving as [...] "a broad description of the institution's collections and an explanation of how and what the museum collects and how those collections are used." [...] The scope of the collection as laid on it in this policy serves to define if, when, and how a cultural institution chooses to accession or deaccession objects from its collection. Additionally, as different types of collections require unique care protocols, the <b>collection</b> <b>policy</b> also details the categories associated with the collection such as library or archive, education or research, permanent, and exhibit. The <b>collection</b> <b>policy</b> might also address conflicts of interest for employees who hold personal collections that {{are similar to those of}} the institution within which they are employed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the English {{literary}} canon has reasserted itself in electronic form. It traces the history of print canons and contends that analogous forces are shaping an electronic canon. This issue should concern not only literary critics, but also information professionals. Humanities scholars need diverse resources, rare texts and multiple editions of works. Yet canons threaten diversity of resources, {{and it is difficult}} for works to re-establish their place once excluded. If Collection managers aim to provide a wide range of high quality resources for future users then an electronic canon is undesirable. If we are to avoid such problems then questions of electronic <b>collections</b> <b>policy</b> must be addressed. For example, do funding councils bear a responsibility to ensure that less canonical texts are available? Who makes the decisions about what is important, and on what basis? How should electronic <b>collections</b> <b>policies</b> be formulated? Should the choice of editions which are digitised matter, is a bad edition better than nothing at all? Should <b>collections</b> <b>policy</b> for electronic resources be organised on a national level, or left to individual institutions?
