5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. <b>Chronic</b> <b>active</b> <b>hepatitis</b> has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|When {{the amount}} of copper in the liver overwhelms the {{proteins}} that normally bind it, it causes oxidative damage through {{a process known as}} Fenton chemistry; this damage eventually leads to <b>chronic</b> <b>active</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> fibrosis (deposition of connective tissue) and cirrhosis. The liver also releases copper into the bloodstream that is not bound to ceruloplasmin. This free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the kidneys, eyes and brain. In the brain, most copper is deposited in the basal ganglia, particularly in the putamen and globus pallidus (together called the lenticular nucleus); these areas normally participate in the coordination of movement as well as playing a significant role in neurocognitive processes such as the processing of stimuli and mood regulation. Damage to these areas, again by Fenton chemistry, produces the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in Wilson's disease.|$|E
25|$|Hepatic reactions, {{including}} hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, <b>chronic</b> <b>active</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> and hepatic necrosis, occur rarely.

40|$|Of 30 {{patients}} with <b>active</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> studied prospectively {{over the past}} 3 years, 14 showed {{one or more of}} the following features: prolonged jaundice, pruritus, hypercholesterolemia and elevation of the serum alkaline phosphatase. Six patients had conspicuous clinical and biochemical evidence of cholestasis. Wedge biopsies of the liver were obtained in 3 of these 6 patients, and multiple biopsies in 4 of them, but none of the histologic features characteristic of primary biliary cirrhosis were seen at the time of diagnosis. Antimitochondrial antibodies were absent on repeated testing, except in 1 patient in whom the test became strongly positive 2 years after diagnosis. Repeat biopsy in this patient showed apparent diminution in the number of small bile ducts. In addition, electron microscopic examination of liver biopsies from 2 {{patients with}} <b>active</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> without overt evidence of cholestasis, showed ultrastructural evidence of this complication.

50|$|An {{association}} was seen between viral hepatitis and HLA-A1.

40|$|The hepatitis-B {{surface antigen}} (HBsAG) may be {{persistently}} {{present in the}} serum {{in a few cases}} of <b>active</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> but the cause of the disease in most patients is unknown. In a study of 39 HBsAg-negative cases cell-mediated immunity to HBsAg was observed in 24 (62 %), suggesting a high frequency of previous infection with the hepatitis-B virus. Hepatitis-B surface antibody was detectable by radioimmunoassay in six patients, in all of whom complexes of HBsAg were present in the serum on electron microscopy. Out of 12 patients with HBsAg-positive <b>active</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> who were also studied eight, including all those untreated at the time, showed a cellular response to the antigen. Evidence of sensitization to a liver-specific cell surface lipoprotein was found with similar frequency in the two groups.

50|$|Liver kidney microsomal type 1 {{antibody}} is an autoantibody {{associated with}} autoimmune hepatitis. It {{is one of}} the several subtypes of anti-liver-kidney microsome antibodies that are known. LKM-1 antibodies associated with autoimmune <b>chronic</b> <b>active</b> <b>hepatitis</b> recognize P450 2D6, a cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase. The frequent association of anti-LKM-1 antibodies and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and the probable existence of an infectious and autoimmune form of anti-LKM-1-associated hepatitis, requiring different therapeutical strategies, necessitates the exact determination of anti-LKM-1 specificities. Therefore, we compared various antibody tests (immunofluorescence, ELISA with recombinant P450 2D6, and Western blot with recombinant and natural antigens and agargel double diffusion) with sera of 27 anti-LKM-1-positive <b>chronic</b> <b>active</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (CAH) patients, with 61 sera harbouring anti-mitochondrial antibodies, 100 sera each from HCV-RNA-positive and HCV-RNA-negative patients, and 50 sera of healthy persons. Western blot techniques using recombinant MS2-polymerase P450 2D6 fusion protein were found to be the most sensitive and specific method for anti-LKM-1 antibody determination in routine laboratory. The recently recognized association of anti-LKM-1 antibody and HCV infection was confirmed by the results of this study. In anti-HCV and HCV-RNA-positive patients with anti-LKM-1 antibodies there was a preponderance of males with higher mean age and lower antibody titres. The results support the hypothesis of the existence of an autoimmune as well as an infectious (HCV triggered) subgroup of anti-LKM-1-positive hepatitis.|$|E

40|$|Studies of the cell-mediated {{response}} to liver antigens, using the leucocyte migration test, in 163 patients with various liver disorders showed that abnormal responses were almost confined to <b>active</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (53 % abnormal), primary biliary cirrhosis (64 %), and cryptogenic cirrhosis (29 %). The test was also abnormal in {{five out of}} seven patients with jaundice due to drug hypersensitivity and in one patient with acute infectious hepatitis {{at a time when}} mitochondrial antibodies were present in the serum. More of those with <b>active</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> on prednisone or azathioprine had normal tests than of those who were untreated, and in 8 out of 10 examined serially during therapy there was an accompanying improvement in leucocyte migration. Abnormal responses to salivary gland or kidney antigens were also found in nearly half of those with features of Sjögren's syndrome or renal tubular acidosis as part of a multisystem involvement—this, though occurring in cryptogenic cirrhosis, was found with greater frequency in <b>active</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and primary biliary cirrhosis. These cell-mediated immune responses, perhaps triggered by the initial damage to the liver from viral or other agents, may be responsible both for the perpetuation of the liver disease and, because of common surface antigens, for the damage to other organs...|$|R

Evidence is presented that the patients with <b>active</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> may represent a distinct subgroup of the disease with a young mean age, an even male to female ratio, and a striking lack of other nonorgan-specific autoantibodies—that is, antinuclear and smooth muscle—which are usually present in the other autoimmune variant of the disease...|$|R

50|$|Though {{not used}} as a {{treatment}} for epilepsy, MPA has been found to reduce the frequency of seizures and does not interact with anti-epileptic medications. MPA does not interfere with blood clotting and appears to improve blood parameters for women with sickle cell anemia. Similarly, MPA does not appear to affect liver metabolism, and may improve primary biliary cirrhosis and <b>chronic</b> <b>active</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> Women taking MPA may experience spotting shortly after starting the medication but is not usually serious enough to require medical intervention. With longer use amenorrhoea can occur as can irregular menstruation which is a major source of dissatisfaction, though both can result in improvements with iron deficiency and risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and often do not result in discontinuing the medication. MPA is also prescribed in combination with an estrogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia in post-menopausal women who are undergoing hormone replacement therapy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{appearance}} of anti-nuclear antibodies in autoimmune hepatitis {{was found to}} correlated with A1-B8-DR3. One {{of the problems with}} autoimmune hepatitis is there is an increased risk in coeliac disease. Primary biliary cirrhosis which often follows <b>chronic</b> <b>active</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is linked to [...] "DRw3", DR3, gene. Celiac disease is often increased in autoimmune hepatitis and vice versa. Recent studies indicate a more insidious association between gluten sensitivity and autoimmune hepatitis.

This could indicate an association with [...] enteropathy, or alternatively the result of chronic viral infection which is known to also elevate anti-tranglutaminase antibody.

50|$|Matt Lamb {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, in 1932. He {{was the son of}} a funeral {{director}} Matt Lamb Sr. who bought the Blake-Lamb funeral home in 1928. At the age of 18 Matt Lamb Jr. became a partner in the business and transformed the funeral parlor into a prominent chain of funeral enterprises. He married Rosemarie Graham, in 1954, and produced four children. Lamb's business expanded to six different locations by 1970 and continued to expand. In his late 40s, Lamb was diagnosed with mononucleosis complicated by <b>chronic</b> <b>active</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and sarcoidosis of the liver. Repeated medical tests at the Mayo Clinic showed that none of the diseases were still present. He had either been misdiagnosed or miraculously cured. He sold his funeral business in 1986 and opened his first painting studio in Chicago. Lamb decided to use his remaining time to spread his message of peace, tolerance, hope, communication, and love among men with his works of art. In 1988, he established two more studios in Florida and, in 1990, in Wisconsin.|$|E
