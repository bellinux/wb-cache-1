50|$|Most {{automated}} {{telephone exchanges}} use digital switching rather than mechanical or analog switching. The trunks connecting the exchanges are also digital, called circuits or channels. However analog two-wire circuits are still used {{to connect the}} last mile from the exchange to the telephone in the home (also called the local loop). To carry a typical {{phone call from a}} calling party to a called party, the analog audio signal is digitized at an 8 kHz sample rate with 8-bit resolution using a special type of nonlinear pulse code modulation known as G.711. The call is then transmitted from one end to another via telephone exchanges. The call is switched using a <b>call</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> protocol (usually ISUP) between the telephone exchanges under an overall routing strategy.|$|E
50|$|The {{telephone}} switching in the ISCs was then typically crossbar or electronic controlled cross-points such as reed relays. The transmission media {{was likely to}} be satellite or lengthy terrestrial submarine cable channels. In some cases these were advantaged or multiplied with TASI (Time-Assignment Speech Interpolation) or DCME (Digital Circuit Multiplication Equipment). These transmission methods were not suited to Line or Inter-Register signalling. Taking the signalling function away from the traffic channel could cut costs, and would later lead to Common Channel Signalling. There would be no need for filtering signalling away from speech, and the duty cycle of the costly trunk for each revenue earning call would be better. Signalling time in <b>call</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> and clear down would be significantly shorter than with C4 and C5. With telephone signalling not transmitted over the line, the opportunities for fraud were reduced.|$|E

40|$|Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) {{is widely}} {{accepted}} as the transfer mode for Broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks (BISDN). As ATM networks provide connection-oriented services, signalling {{is an essential}} component of these networks. The performance of the signalling system is crucial in determining the scalability of the network. Call performance measurements on two different ATM switches were carried out using a broadband network analyser. Calls are generated according to a deterministic/Poisson distribution and various components of the <b>call</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> delay are analysed. The probability distribution of the delays is obtained and the correlation between the set up delay and its different constituents is established. It is observed that the delays at the calling and the called user entities of the UNI form a major component of the <b>call</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> delay. The average <b>call</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> delay is found to be 21 and 27 ms, respectively, when a single switch is involved in <b>call</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> and 50 ms when two switches are involved in <b>call</b> <b>set</b> <b>up.</b> With simultaneous call arrivals, though with higher delays, both the switches are found to establish calls at the rate of 100 calls/s. # 1999 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The {{two major}} {{standards}} in the multimedia services over IP area are the protocol suites H. 323 (ITU-T) and SIP (IETF). Both have emerged as competing protocol standards for the signaling and call control of IP telephony. SIP is designed with a broader scope, offering functions specifically designed to enable easy extensions; {{it should be the}} advantage for new potential services. H. 323 is still the more mature standard; H. 323 provides better interoperability and interworking (PSTN, ISDN). We can assume a coexistence of both protocols. We compare voice performance parameters like talking time, total sessions, delay, jitter packet delivery ratio, <b>call</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> times and throughput, establish the differences in performance of these two VoIP protocols through an Qualnet simulation. SIP and H. 323 are used for establishment and release of Voice over IP calls as well as Video and Media calls.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to analyze video calls over the Internet Protocol (Video over IP) using a {{simulated}} IMS environment (IMS-in-a-box). The thesis presents an overview of IMS, its purpose and how it has evolved.

The thesis considers a number of different video call case scenarios that {{are most likely to be}} encountered when making video calls over the Internet using the Internet protocol. This analysis focuses mainly on the SIP, RTP/RTCP protocols and how these three protocols are related and synchronized in order to actually know what is happening during the course of <b>call</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> and media exchange between the various end callers involved. The report looks into aspects of bandwidth consumption by the exchanged media (RTP and RTCP), jitter and its variation over the duration of the calls and the cooperation between the control plane and the user plane in order for a smooth <b>call</b> <b>set</b> <b>up,</b> media exchange and release of network resources.
