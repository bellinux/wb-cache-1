Fewer than half of the state's high school {{graduates}} attended college. Many teachers educated in Kentucky sought higher salaries available in other states. Combs' biennial budget, passed by the General Assembly in 1960, used money from the new sales tax to increase school funds by fifty percent and establish the state community <b>college</b> <b>system</b> (now the Kentucky Community and Technical <b>College</b> <b>System).</b> It also increased funding for free textbooks by more than $3million and allocated another $2million to vocational education.

Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidateâformer president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912âhas won as much as 20% of the popular vote.

5|$|At the 1961 Australian Championships, Windle won the 1500m {{in a time}} of 17min 37.7s {{to claim}} his first Australian title at the age of 16. However, his victory was overshadowed when his bathers partly fell off during the race. In the {{following}} year, Windle showed his versatility by winning the 220yd, 440yd and 1650yd freestyle events, in times of 2min 2.9s, 4min 25.0s and 17min 53.3s respectively. He also anchored the New South Wales team to victory in the 4Ã220yd freestyle relay. Selected for the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, he marked his international debut with silver and bronze in the 1650yd and 440yd freestyle respectively.

Windle also won gold in the 4Ã220yd freestyle relay, along with Rose, Allan Wood and Anthony Strahan, setting a world record in the process.|$|E
40|$|Americaâs {{community}} colleges have recently been thrust into the national spotlight as people look to retrain or find economic alternatives to higher education. This substantial increase in accountability is met with the constraints of financial resources and other limiting factors structured into community <b>college</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper I examine community college return on investment by states, which govern the responsibility of educating Americaâs workforce through their diverse community <b>college</b> <b>systems.</b> To improve Americaâs postsecondary education competency is to optimize collective action of U. S. state community <b>college</b> <b>systems.</b> While <b>colleges</b> and universities contribute to national education goals, research shows that {{community colleges}} have and will do much of that work. Return on investment is one key metric that policymakers, by state, can use to deal with and advance community collegesâ heightened call to action...|$|R
