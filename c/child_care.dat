5|$|Under communism, {{everyone}} was guaranteed employment. However, women suffered the double burden of paid and unpaid work, leading to lower birth rates. The commitment to social equality {{and the issue}} of declining birth rates allowed women to have some rights, such as <b>child</b> <b>care</b> and child allowances. For example, in the Soviet Union, maternity leave was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced. With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although there has been an increase in female workers, their need for welfare support such as <b>child</b> <b>care</b> has not been met, and has been ignored.|$|E

Parental maltreatment and other disadvantages mean that their life outcomes are often poor compared to children generally. Anglicare Victoria’s <b>Children</b> in <b>Care</b> Report Card shows the ‘gap’ between <b>children</b> in <b>care</b> and all <b>children.</b> Information on 142 <b>children</b> in <b>care</b> was collected from case records and compared to population data. The results for physical activity, obesity and healthy lifestyle were positive. However, a much higher proportion of <b>children</b> in <b>care</b> had emotional and behavioural problems and chronic health conditions compared to children who were not in care. Education participation rates of <b>children</b> in <b>care</b> were similar to children in the community. However, <b>children</b> in <b>care</b> were less engaged in education and less likely to be reaching their learning potential. Older teenagers in care also had limited independent living skills and lacked access to important identity documents. Too many <b>children</b> in <b>care</b> were disconnected from birth fathers and peers. <b>Children</b> in <b>care</b> also had fewer opportunities than children who were not in care to participate in activities that would help them build community networks.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{quantify}} {{the influence of}} the type of child-care on the occurrence of acute diarrhea with special emphasis on the effect of <b>children</b> grouping during <b>care.</b> METHODS: From October 1998 to January 1999 292 children, aged 24 to 36 months, recruited using a previously assembled cohort of newborns, were evaluated. Information on the type of care and occurrence of diarrhea in the previous year was obtained from parents by telephone interview. The X² and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare proportions and quantitative variables, respectively. The risk of diarrhea was estimated through the calculation of incident odds ratios (OR) and their respective 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI), crude and adjusted by unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Using as reference category <b>children</b> <b>cared</b> individually at home, the adjusted ORs for diarrhea occurrence were 3. 18, 95 % CI [1. 49, 6. 77] for <b>children</b> <b>cared</b> in group at home, 2. 28, 95 % CI [0. 92, 5. 67] for <b>children</b> <b>cared</b> in group in day-care homes and 2. 54, 95 % CI [1. 21, 5. 33] for <b>children</b> <b>cared</b> in day-care centers.

40|$|The {{substitute}} educational care embraces {{all kinds}} of a substitute family for children without own functioning family background. There are two forms - the institutional and the family one. In my bachelor thesis I focused on issues relating to children from the Charlotta Masaryk´s <b>Children</b> <b>Care</b> Home and their departure to substitute family care. This medical facility has a relatively small capacity and is intended for children from one to three years of age. In accordance with the set goals, I divided the practical part into two sections. The first goal was to ascertain social, health and legal situation of children with ordered institutional upbringing, who {{were placed in the}} Charlotta Masaryk´s <b>Children</b> <b>Care</b> Home in the years of 2005 to 2008. The other goal was to map the situation of children with the ordered institutional upbringing, who departed from the Charlotta Masaryk´s <b>Children</b> <b>Care</b> Home to the substitute family care. Both goals were fulfilled. In order to fulfil the goals, a quantitative research method was used, i. e. the secondary data analysis technique. The following hypotheses were set: Hypothesis 1 - The most frequent reason for placing children in the children´s care home are social and health reasons Hypothesis 2 - the majority of children come to the children´s family home in a bad health condition. Hypothesis 3 - the majority of children from the children´s family home are in contact with their biological family Hypothesis 4 - Children placed in the substitute family care leave most frequently to the foster care. The hypothesis 2 was not confirmed, while the other hypotheses proved correct. It follows from the results of the hypothesis 1, that children come to the <b>children</b> <b>care</b> home most often out of social and health reasons, there are few purely health reasons. This is connected with the hypothesis 2, which was not confirmed. That is, the majority of children come to the <b>children</b> <b>care</b> home in a good health condition. The predominant majority of children come to the <b>children</b> <b>care</b> home from a family and stay in contact with them (hypothesis 3). Children most often return to their family; in the event that they leave to the substitute family care, then the foster care prevails over adoption (hypothesis 4). The results of work will be used for the purposes of Charlotta Masaryk´s <b>Children</b> <b>Care</b> Home and also for social workers, so that they can get an overview of the situation in the facility in question...|$|R
50|$|Many <b>children</b> enter <b>care</b> {{with bad}} health; over 90% have medical needs ranging from minor skin {{conditions}} to severe neurological disease. <b>Children</b> in <b>care</b> experience {{twice as many}} chronic difficulties, such as poor eyesight and hearing, when compared to children outside of the system. Often, <b>children</b> in <b>care</b> have poor or undocumented history of immunizations. <b>Children</b> in kinship <b>care</b> exhibit fewer health problems then those in regular foster care.

5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for <b>child</b> <b>care</b> and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{warnings}} from Noseworthy to control spending, Dunderdale's first budget saw spending increase by 4.9 percent. Spending {{was focused on}} infrastructure, health care, social programs, Nalcor Energy {{as well as other}} areas. The budget included tax credits for <b>child</b> <b>care,</b> volunteer fire fighters as well as an 8 percent Residential Energy Rebate on home heating fuel, which is equal to the provincial portion of the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The budget raised the threshold on the payroll tax exemption from $1 million to $1.2 million. Despite a $598 million surplus for the previous year and a $59 surplus forecasted for the coming year, the province's net debt was expected to increase from $8.2 billion to $8.67 billion due to unfunded liabilities. However, on November 16, 2011, Dunderdale's government released their Fall economic update and announced that the surplus for the 2011-2012, fiscal year was now projected to be $755.8 million, with the added surplus going towards the debt. In the audited financial statements released in January 2013, the surplus for the 2011-2012 was $882.8 million, with the overall debt falling to $7.8 billion.|$|E
5|$|During Linnaeus' time it {{was normal}} for upper class women to have wet nurses for their babies. Linnaeus joined an ongoing {{campaign}} to end this practice in Sweden and promote breast-feeding by mothers. In 1752 Linnaeus published a thesis along with Frederick Lindberg, a physician student, based on their experiences. In {{the tradition of the}} period, this dissertation was essentially an idea of the presiding reviewer (prases) expounded upon by the student. Linnaeus' dissertation was translated into French by J.E. Gilibert in 1770 as La Nourrice marâtre, ou Dissertation sur les suites funestes du nourrisage mercénaire. Linnaeus suggested that children might absorb the personality of their wet nurse through the milk. He admired the <b>child</b> <b>care</b> practices of the Lapps and pointed out how healthy their babies were compared to those of Europeans who employed wet nurses. He compared the behaviour of wild animals and pointed out how none of them denied their newborns their breastmilk. It is thought that his activism played a role in his choice of the term Mammalia for the class of organisms.|$|E
