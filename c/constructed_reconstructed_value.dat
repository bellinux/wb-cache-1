40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{accuracy}} of the usual procedure for neutrino energy reconstruction which is based on the quasielastic kinematics. Our results are described in terms of a probability distribution for a real neutrino energy value. Several factors are responsible for the deviations from the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>value.</b> The main one is the multinucleon component of the neutrino interaction which in the case of Cherenkov detectors enters as a quasielastic cross section, increasing the mean neutrino energy which can differ appreciably from the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>value.</b> As an application we derive, for excess electron events attributed to the conversion of muon neutrinos, the true neutrino energy distribution based on the experimental one which is given in terms of the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>value.</b> The result is a reshaping effect. For MiniBooNE the low energy peak is suppressed and shifted at higher energies, which may influence the interpretation in terms of oscillation. For T 2 K at the Super Kamiokande far detector the reshaping translates into a narrowing of the energy distribution. © 2012 American Physical Society.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method, {{based on the}} Filtered Back Projection technique (FBP) to compute directly {{the values of the}} gradient and the laplacien of an X-Ray image. We propose a way to pre-process the raw data that allow us to compute directly the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>values</b> of the gradient or of the laplacien at any location in the plane (defined with real coordinates) without reconstructing an image of the absorption coefficients. The <b>reconstructed</b> <b>values</b> of the gradient and of the laplacien correspond to the exact mathematical definition of the differentials of the image and do not imply the use of a band limited filter depending on a constant s, as proposed previously by other authors. For noisy data, we propose also an extension of existing FBP techniques, adapted to the computation of the gradient and of the laplacien. At last, we show how to use those new algorithms to perform the segmentation of a slice, without image reconstruction. Images of the reconstructed gradient, laplacien and segmented objects are presented...|$|R

40|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) imaging {{relies on}} computational algorithms to reconstruct images from projections {{gathered from the}} CT scan. Depending on the scanner geometry, different types of reconstruction algorithms can be used. To study these different types of reconstruction algorithms in a user-friendly way, a software tool was built. The aim of the thesis {{was to provide a}} software platform to access a number of previously implemented reconstruction algorithms with ease and minimal knowledge of the reconstruction code. The goal was accomplished by building a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using MATLAB 7. 7. 0 (R 2008 b). In addition to creating mathematical objects and invoking the various reconstruction algorithms, the tool provides newly developed features to analyze the reconstructed images. This thesis first presents an overview of CT and associated reconstruction algorithms. It then describes the features to simulate two-dimensional as well as three-dimensional objects. The reconstructions available are categorized on the basis of different scanner geometries. The tool has the flexibility to specify a range of parameter values for the reconstruction. Finally the tool allows qualitative and quantitative analysis of reconstructed images by using the analysis tool. A couple of test phantoms were simulated to demonstrate the capabilities of the GUI tool. The tests performed included the mask analysis to study the relationship between the standard deviation of <b>reconstructed</b> <b>values</b> and the relevant reconstruction parameters, image subtraction to demonstrate differences in <b>reconstructed</b> <b>values,</b> line profile analysis to show variation of <b>reconstructed</b> image <b>values</b> in more detail, and lastly qualitative image display to visualize reconstruction artifacts using the available reconstruction algorithms. The implemented GUI tool, thus, allows the user to study different reconstruction algorithms with ease using a single panel. It also systematically arranges the available reconstruction algorithms under each scanner geometry. Overall, the tool allows the user to study various objects and reconstruction algorithms by varying different input parameters...|$|R

In [34], the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>value</b> is instead computed as the expectation of the source coefficient given the quantization interval and the side information value, showing improved performance.
