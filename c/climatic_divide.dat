5000|$|The {{area where}} some of the strongest bora winds occur is the Velebit {{mountain}} range in Croatia. This seaside mountain chain, spanning 145 kilometers, represents a huge weather and <b>climatic</b> <b>divide</b> between the sharp continental climate of the interior, characterized by significant day/night temperature differences throughout the year, and the Adriatic coast, with a Mediterranean climate. Bora occurs because these two divided masses tend to equalize. Sailing during the Bura can be challenging and it requires caution, regarding readiness of both the boat and its crew. Short, high waves with white crests are its characteristics, making the navigation difficult. The small drops formed by the wind create a so-called [...] "sea smoke" [...] that reduces the visibility significantly. Experienced seamen have a proverb: [...] "When Bura sails, you don't!" [...] Sailing can be extremely dangerous for an unexperienced navigator in the Velebit channel because the wind can start suddenly on a clear and calm day and result in major problems, frequently also affecting road traffic. Near the towns of Senj, Stara Novalja, Karlobag and the southern portal of the Sveti Rok Tunnel in Croatia, it can reach speeds of up to 220 kilometers per hour. On 21 December 1998 the speed of a gust on the Maslenica Bridge (north of Zadar) was measured at a record speed of 248 kilometres per hour. During 22 to 25 December 2003 on A1 highway near Sveti Rok Tunnel a new record was measured at a speed of 304 kilometers per hour.|$|E
40|$|The {{severity}} of the Arabian Gulf environment demands certain provisions for a design code that would cater to local challenges in concreting. With this view in mind, an apparent <b>climatic</b> <b>divide</b> was identified for the Arabian Peninsula viz. Hot–Dry and Hot–Humid zones which were further classified into an order of exposures, detailing the potential dangers to concrete durability. Moreover, suggestions are included based on both research and experience in the Gulf, to practice essential quantity and quality checks on concrete mix design parameters. It is intended that this contribution would help formulate a draft design code respecting concrete durability {{in this part of}} the world...|$|E
40|$|A metric was {{developed}} for assessing anthropogenic impacts on aquatic macrophyte ecology by scoring macrophyte species along the main gradient of community change. A measure of ecological quality was then calculated by Weighted Averaging (WA) of these species scores at a monitoring site, and comparison to a reference condition score. This metric was used to illustrate the difficulties of developing aquatic macrophyte indices based on indicator species in Mediterranean rivers. The response of the metric to a nutrient gradient was examined within two different river typologies: the national typology designed for the Water Framework Directive and a typology that segregates the environmental variables to produce maximum species similarity within a river type. Both typologies showed the strong north–south <b>climatic</b> <b>divide</b> in Portugal, with southern rivers having long periods without rainfall and often without flowing water in the summer. Overall, the metric responded well to nutrient impacts however it performed poorly in some southern lowland river types. This {{was thought to be}} due to low numbers of aquatic macrophytes in temporary rivers. Non-aquatic species that establish in the river channel of temporary rivers may have to be included in indices to improve performance. Also, simple Weighted Averaging (WA) metrics may be insensitive to abundance changes and loss of rarer indicators in lowland Mediterranean rivers. More sophisticated methods of using WA are suggested, as well as further research into developing assessment methods specific to the character of Mediterranean river...|$|E

5000|$|In {{temperate}} latitudes three-thousanders play {{an important}} role, because even in summer they lie below the zero degree line for weeks. Thus the chains of three-thousanders always form important <b>climatic</b> <b>divides</b> and support glaciation - in the Alps the 3,000-metre contour is roughly the general limit of the [...] "nival step"; only a few glaciated mountains are under 3,000 metres (the Dachstein, the easternmost glaciated mountain in the Alps, is, at 2,995 m, not a three-thousander). In the Mediterranean, however, the three-thousanders remain free of ice and, in the tropics, they are almost insignificant from a climatic perspective; here the snow line lies at around 4,500 to 5,000 metres, and in the dry continental areas (Trans-Himalayas, Andes) it may be up to 6,500 metres high.|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} {{deals with}} morphology, properties and genesis of major- soil groups acquiring morpho-pedogenic horizons. The prevailing <b>climatic</b> conditions <b>divide</b> the region into two different zones, these are: the arid-hyperthermic and ustic-thermic climatic zones. Within the aridic-hyperthermic zone, changes ascribed to pedogenesis {{deal with the}} soluble fraction of the plasma and include: accumulation of salts, gypsum or lime to form salic, gypsic or calcic horizons, respectively. Despite the significant influences of pedogenesis on morphology of soil profiles, their properties are largely determined by those of the parent material. Soils on the ustic-thermic zone appear with much more advanced stages of profile development. Changes ascribed to pedogenesis in these soils include: removals of the easy soluble part of the mobile fraction, additions of organic matter to form mollic epipedon, illuvation of clay to form argillic horizons and liberation of iron from Fe-bearing minerals...|$|R
40|$|Bulgaria is {{situated}} on the Balkan Peninsula. Its northern frontier is {{the lower part of}} the Danube. The Balkan range, with its zonal situation, is part of a natural <b>climatic</b> frontier, <b>dividing</b> Bulgaria into two parts—north and south. One of the main features of the climate in the Danube Plain (northern Bulgaria) is insufficient precipitation—a tendency toward dryness and frequent droughts. The annual amount of precipitation is 500 – 600 mm. The highest monthly values are measured in June (in some places in May), with 55 – 75 mm. February (in some places, March) is the driest month. Absence of precipitation can occur in any month, but the probability of this happening in May and June is very low. At the same time, monthly precipitation can exceed 100 mm in any month; in the summer it can even exceed 250 – 300 mm. The radiation balance is about 50 Kkal. sm- 2.

40|$|Direct {{evaporative}} cooling can be profitable in hot arid climates, whereas favorable situations are not frequent in temperate zones. First the climate limits to direct operation are {{set on the}} psychometric diagram. Then an alternative process is considered that can provide free cooling via evaporation {{for a lot of}} climatic conditions not particularly dry and very common in temperate climate: indirect {{evaporative cooling}}. Air is cooled in an adiabatic humidification process, and then in turn the same air is used to reduce – via a heat exchanger – the temperature of a second stream of air, whose moisture content consequently remains unchanged. The cooling effect is particularly strong when the air to be humidified is the ambient air being discharged.

40|$|AbstractThe {{building}} {{sector in}} Saudi Arabia imposes significant {{energy and environmental}} challenges at the national level. To address these challenges, {{it is crucial to}} promote sustainable buildings. Since energy and environmental performance of buildings is closely related to climate conditions both in terms of energy consumption and potential for renewable energy, it is crucial to investigate these conditions. In Saudi Arabia, {{there is a great deal}} of variation in terms of climatic features. Therefore, the country needs to be divided into zones with common climatic characteristics. In literature there are a number of approaches to classify Saudi Arabia in <b>climatic</b> zones, <b>dividing</b> the country from one to nine zones. For building energy modelling at the national level, it is critical to select an appropriate climatic classification scheme. This article examined 16 different climatic classification methods to identify the most appropriate one for building energy modelling. Through the development of weighted criteria assessment matrix based upon the Decision-Matrix method, the present work recommends Saudi Arabia to be classified into five inhabited distinctive climatic zones represented by Dhahran, Guriat, Riyadh, Jeddah, Khamis Mushait...|$|R
40|$|We {{collected}} data on breeding birds in Anhui Province, and predicted and mapped their ranges using GIS techniques. We divided {{the study area}} into 425 grids which were used as operative geographic units to analyze breeding bird distributional patterns and hotspot. Faunistic composition analysis showed that geographic units in Anhui Province could {{be divided into two}} groups along a boundary from northern DabieMountain to Chaohu Lake. Indomalayan species accounted for 60 % of the total species in all geographic unit groups, with an increase in the group’s prevalence from north to south. Ecological distribution analysis showed that bird distribution units could be divided into two groups which were consistent with division by <b>climatic</b> zones. When <b>divided</b> into seven groups, clusters were closely related to the environmental features such as terrain and landform. The hotspot analysis showed that richness of total breeding birds, breeding birds in the “List of Wildlife Under Special State Protection” of China, and breeding birds listed in CITES appendices I and II were all higher in southern Anhui Province. Therefore, we suggest that areas in southern Anhui Province should be targeted for special protection for bird diversity conservation...|$|R
40|$|The Late Paleozoic in West Gondwana was {{a period}} of {{significant}} climatic changes, ranging from a glacial climate in the Late Carboniferous to a semi-arid climate in the Late Permian. The Floristic Province of Gondwana in the Parana Basin was directly affected by such changes, and underwent a transformation regarding composition and geographic distribution. Thus, the <b>climatic</b> phases were <b>divided</b> into three intervals: Phase A containing interglacially developed flora; Phase B, containing floras of immediate post-glacial temperate climates, and phase C, identified with floras related to the decline of dryness. Regarding their geographical distribution, the floras were concentrated in the far-northern and far-southern portions of the basin during the Glacial interval, and, with a gradual increase in temperature, went on to occupy the entire basin. Finally, we can see that the floras located in the Argentinean portion of West Gondwana are older and have greater species diversity than those present in the Parana Basin and Africa during Phase A. In Phase B, there is a decline of Argentinean flora species, a large increase in the Parana Basin floras, and an average increase in African floras. In the final stage, the floristic province no longer exists in Argentina, the flora of the Parana Basin also suffers a decrease of specimens, and the African flora undergoes its moment of greatest development. Such diversity change also reflects a west-to-east migration throughout the Late Carboniferous. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mountain {{ecosystems}} {{all over}} the world support a high biological diversity and provide home and services to some 12 % of the global human population, who use their traditional ecological knowledge to utilise local natural resources. The Himalayas are the world's youngest, highest and largest mountain range and support a high plant biodiversity. In this remote mountainous region of the Himalaya, people depend upon local plant resources to supply a range of goods and services, including grazing for livestock and medicinal supplies for themselves. Due to their remote location, harsh climate, rough terrain and topography, many areas within this region still remain poorly known for its floristic diversity, plant species distribution and vegetation ecosystem service. Methods The Naran valley in the north-western Pakistan is among such valleys and occupies a distinctive geographical location {{on the edge of the}} Western Himalaya range, close to the Hindu Kush range to the west and the Karakorum Mountains to the north. It is also located on <b>climatic</b> and geological <b>divides,</b> which further add to its botanical interest. In the present project 120 informants were interviewed at 12 main localities along the 60 km long valley. This paper focuses on assessment of medicinal plant species valued by local communities using their traditional knowledge. Results Results revealed that 101 species belonging to 52 families (51. 5 % of the total plants) were used for 97 prominent therapeutic purposes. The largest number of ailments cured with medicinal plants were associated with the digestive system (32. 76 % responses) followed by those associated with the respiratory and urinary systems (13. 72 % and 9. 13 % respectively). The ailments associated with the blood circulatory and reproductive systems and the skin were 7. 37 %, 7. 04 % and 7. 03 %, respectively. The results also indicate that whole plants were used in 54 % of recipes followed by rhizomes (21 %), fruits (9. 5 %) and roots (5. 5 %). Conclusion Our findings demonstrate the range of ecosystem services that are provided by the vegetation and assess how utilisation of plants will impact on future resource sustainability. The study not only contributes to an improved understanding of traditional ethno-ecological knowledge amongst the peoples of the Western Himalaya but also identifies priorities at species and habitat level for local and regional plant conservation strategies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Among the palaeoecological proxies used, palynological {{analysis}} {{is commonly used}} for the <b>climatic</b> zonation to <b>divide</b> geological time periods. Often, single cores from lacustrine sediments are {{used to create a}} pollen diagram. Some of these pollen records are directly dated through the use of radiocarbon, other records are in an indirect way dated by correlation to pollen zones with a known date. In the asymmetrically-shaped Preboreal residual channel of Anhamm, in the Niers-Rhine valley in Germany, a zonation based on two cores, located roughly 8 meters apart, shows differences in the two pollen diagrams. The palynological analysis suggest a taphonomic bias on the cores, especially in the deepest core containing the longest record which is often chosen for sampling. The pollen assemblage from the deepest core, located near the outer cut bank of the residual channel, would have been influenced by local vegetation entrapping or blocking dispersed pollen grains. To {{find out more about the}} local conditions and possible taphonomic influence on the pollen assemblage, a macrobotanical analysis was conducted in this thesis. The aim was to compare the two cores within each palaeobotanical proxy, and to compare the data and eventual interpretation between the proxies. The thesis was based on two important questions: 1) What could be interpreted regarding palaeo-environmental reconstruction from the macrobotanical remains of the cores Anhamm-A and Anhamm-B, and 2) Comparing the data from the macrobotanical analysis with the palynological analysis, what problems might arise from interpreting the data considering palaeoenvironmental reconstructions? The approach was to get a detailed view of what palynological applications are used for, and which steps are taken from raw data to determine the boundaries for pollen zones. The former research on palaeoenvironmental studies on the Niers-Rhine valley were compared to this case study of Anhamm, and the former palynological analysis on the Anhamm cores was subsequently compared in different levels to the macrobotanical analysis. To conclude, the macrobotanical analysis shows a local vegetation development in a hydroseral succession, and suggests a discrepancy between tree macrofossils and microfossils in the middle part of both cores. The contrast gives an example of different outcome between proxies that affect the interpretation of the pollen-assemblage zonation of Anhamm. AMS-dates could offer more clarity in the different perspectives on the zonation, age and resolution of the residual channel deposits. For asymmetrical residual channel deposits, not only multiple cores should be used, but rather multiple proxies to set a stronger foundation in palaeoenvironmental reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{patterns}} of speciation is of fundamental importance to evolutionary biologists. Species diversity {{can be maintained}} and generated through processes originating from interactions with climate, biota, and geography. In order to investigate the role of these factors on diversity in a species-rich group of plants, we developed a phylogeny of the core Bromelioideae including Aechmea and related genera with the specific goals of investigating monophyly of genera, biogeographic history, morphological trait evolution, and environmental niche diversification. The phylogenetic estimation encompassed 20 genera and 4 genomic regions including chloroplast, low-copy, and ribosomal nuclear genes. Subsequently, morphologies were re-explored to understand species relationships {{that had not been}} previously recognized and to determine if morphological synapomorphies could define well supported clades. Species were coded as present or absent in 16 geographic regions to reconstruct ancestral areas. Finally, to understand how species within this group <b>divided</b> <b>climatic</b> niche space, research was focused on two clades that diversified independently in Central America. Niche models were generated for each species and for the clades as a whole and were compared for overlap. The distribution of each environmental variable for all occurrence records was compared at each node of divergence within each clade to understand divergence in environmental conditions in a method free from model uncertainty. From these analyses we found: (1) Lack of monophyly in many genera and subgenera (2) Closely related species often were found in geographic sympatry (at the scale of co-occurrence in the same country or state) such that taxonomic groups that had been thought to include geographically disjunct species, actually were representative of distinct evolutionary histories (3) Morphological traits that had been used to assign species to genera were often homoplastic (through convergence or reversals of plesiomorphic states) (4) Although a single unique synapomorphy for each clade was not found, morphological traits were often consistent within clades, providing independent support for the molecular phylogenetic estimation and a basis for future taxonomic work (5) Most well supported clades diversified within one of eight geographic areas, although the ancestral areas for several larger clades remains uncertain (6) Both clades native to Central America are found in a unique environmental niche (i. e. environmental niche models of each clade do not overlap and there is significant divergence of climatic variables between the clades) (7) Species within the clade composed of species with greater morphological variation had more environmental niche overlap than the clade with little morphological variation. These findings add to the evolutionary knowledge of the Bromeliaceae and suggest that geographic range should be taken into account when assigning species to genera. Centers of diversity of the core Bromelioids are found within eastern and Amazonian Brazil, northern south America and Central America and each radiation could have been influenced by climate in a variety of ways. In the two studied examples, species divergence is coincident with divergence in environmental niche occupation. However, environmental niche evolution was limited such that each clade as a whole was not modeled in the niche of the other clade, suggesting either some degree of niche conservatism or competition preventing parapatric niche expansion...|$|R
