While domed stadiums have been common in North America, no such stadiums of comparable size of Telenor Arena had previously been built for football in Europe. Construction started by demolishing a hangar, which was completed in February 2007.

40|$|Based on {{the changes}} of landuse in Fujian Province during 2000 - 2010, this {{research}} used the buffer analysis {{to define the}} areas impacted by the road networks. Then, the study used the correlation analysis to achieve {{the relationship between the}} density of road networks and landuse transformation in the impacted areas under the different scales. Also, the terrain features of landuse conversion were analyzed. Finally, the threshold of road networks' density was achieved. The results showed that road networks' range of influence was 1 000 m, and the road construction in Fujian Province {{was one of the reasons}} that caused the following transformations: forest transformation <b>to</b> <b>construction,</b> shrub transformation <b>to</b> <b>construction,</b> wetland transformation <b>to</b> <b>construction,</b> farmland transformation <b>to</b> <b>construction.</b> According <b>to</b> the terrain features of landuse transformation under different scales, the following results were obtained: the transformation from forest <b>to</b> <b>construction</b> happened in the altitude of 230 ~ 360 m, the transformation from shrub <b>to</b> <b>construction</b> happened in the altitude of 100 ~ 180 m, the transforma-tion from wetland <b>to</b> <b>construction</b> happened in the altitude of 60 ~ 100 m, the transformation from farmland <b>to</b> <b>construction</b> happened in the al-titude of 110 ~ 200 m, the changes of landuse occurred in the south slope beneath 7 °; According to the threshold of road networks' density, the study achieved the following results: the threshold of the transformation from forest <b>to</b> <b>construction</b> was between 1. 98 km·km- 2 and 2. 27 km· km- 2, the threshold of the transformation from shrub <b>to</b> <b>construction</b> was between 2. 29 km·km- 2 and 2. 92 km·km- 2, the threshold of the trans-formation from wetland <b>to</b> <b>construction</b> was between 2. 61 km·km- 2 and 3. 01 km·km- 2, the threshold of the transformation from farmland <b>to</b> <b>construction</b> was between 2. 23 km·km- 2 and 2. 98 km·km- 2...|$|R

Since completion, this section has undergone much <b>construction</b> <b>to</b> renew bridges over Clear Creek and Washington Street.
