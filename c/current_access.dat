40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of the self}} structured multilayered bubble domain memory as a mass memory medium for satellite applications is examined. Theoretical considerations of multilayer bubble supporting materials are presented, {{in addition to the}} experimental evaluation of <b>current</b> <b>accessed</b> circuitry for various memory functions. The design, fabrication, and test of four device designs is described, and a recommended memory storage area configuration is presented. Memory functions which were demonstrated include the <b>current</b> <b>accessed</b> propagation of bubble domains and stripe domains, pinning of stripe domain ends, generation of single and double bubbles, generation of arrays of coexisting strip and bubble domains in a single garnet layer, and demonstration of different values of the strip out field for single and double bubbles indicating adequate margins for data detection. All functions necessary to develop a multilayer self structured bubble memory device were demonstrated in individual experiments...|$|R
50|$|Santa Clara {{includes}} volcanic {{rocks and}} several small beaches, including some white sand beaches. A {{short distance from}} the western extremity of Santa Clara Island, {{there is a small}} rocky islet, and, at the tip south of the same islet, there is a sandbar composed of various rocks which break the water. Coming from the north, the island of Santa Clara has the appearance of a cliff or escarpment; but approaching from the south, shows an eroded quirky aspect of conical mounds and strangely cut rocks. Waters surrounding the island have a rocky bottom, with strong <b>currents.</b> <b>Access</b> by boat to the island is dangerous, especially in stormy weather, because the strong sea breaks on all sides.|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation determined that <b>current</b> <b>accessed</b> self structured bubble memory devices {{have the potential}} of meeting projected data density and speed requirements. Device concepts analyzed include multilayer ferrimagnetic devices where the top layer contains a domain structure which defines the data location and the second contains the data. Current aperture and permalloy assisted current propagation devices were evaluated. Based on {{the result of this}} work more detailed device research was initiated. Detailed {{theoretical and}} experimental studies indicate that the difference in strip and threshold between a single bubble in the control layer and a double bubble which would exist in both the control layer and data layer is adequate to allow for detection of data. Detailed detector designs were investigated...|$|R
50|$|The <b>current</b> <b>access</b> track {{through the}} Main Settlement Area, from Bundulla Road {{to the site}} of the Old Bundulla Homestead, and the area {{immediately}} adjacent to the Old Bundulla Homestead, have limited potential for evidence relating to the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement. This is due to extensive track realignment and grading and the construction of the homestead building and associated farming infrastructure in this area following the closure of the settlement. No artefacts were located along the <b>current</b> <b>access</b> track and artefacts that are located within the fenced section of the Old Bundulla Homestead complex are unlikely to be related to the settlement period. The <b>current</b> <b>access</b> track through the main settlement area and the Old Bundulla Homestead complex are therefore not of cultural heritage significance.|$|E

5000|$|Intent-based Access Control (IBAC), [...] a novel {{access control}} model first {{proposed}} by Abdulaziz Almehmadi, is an {{access control system}} that detects {{the intention of the}} user requesting access answering the question [...] "Why?" [...] access is being requested as opposed to <b>current</b> <b>access</b> control systems that asks [...] "Who?" [...] is requesting access. IBAC is designed to prevent the insider threat as opposed to the <b>current</b> <b>access</b> control systems that are designed to prevent the outsider threat. IBAC is a risk-based access control that assesses risk of access based on the detected intent and the motivation level towards executing that intent. IBAC takes advantage of the robustness of P300-based Concealed Information Test to detect an intent of access and uses the brain signals to detect the motivation level. The access control system has been used on 30 participants with 100% detected intentions of access and all mal-intent users being rejected access before they commit their mal-intended action.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>current</b> <b>accesses</b> to the tumors of {{the fourth}} ventricle, which fill and {{compress}} from the outside its cavity, was assessed in 28 patients. Original associated endomicrosurgical techniques were used. Two groups and five topographic types of fourth ventricle tumors are identified. Basic accesses — telovelar and supracerebellar — eliminate the necessity of dissecting the vermis cerebelli. The key endoscopic technique {{is to provide a}} simultaneous survey of the lower and upper poles of a tumor during its removal. The technique of trochlear removal of metastatic nodes from the fourth ventricle is shown. The benefits of endoscopic techniques are to early examine the vulnerable vascular and neural structures blocked by a tumor at the access step; to reduce the volume of an access itself and the traction of cerebellar and truncal structures; to completely survey the Sylvian aqueduct without additionally displacing or dissecting the vermis cerebelli; to maintain optical sharpness within sight of differently remote microstructures. Overall, incorporation of the endoscopic method realizes the principle of mini-invasive neurosurgery.  </p...|$|R
