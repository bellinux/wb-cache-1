2500|$|A thymocyte's fate is {{determined}} during positive selection. [...] Double-positive cells (CD4+/CD8+) that interact well with MHC class II molecules will eventually become CD4+ cells, whereas thymocytes that interact well with MHC class I molecules mature into CD8+ cells. [...] A T cell becomes a CD4+ cell by down-regulating expression of its <b>CD8</b> <b>cell</b> surface receptors. [...] If the cell does not lose its signal, {{it will continue}} downregulating CD8 and become a CD4+, single positive cell. [...] But, {{if there is a}} signal interruption, the cell stops downregulating CD8 and switches over to downregulating CD4 molecules, instead, eventually becoming a CD8+, single positive cell.|$|E
5000|$|By {{shedding}} decoy NKG2D soluble ligands, {{tumor cells}} may avoid immune responses. These soluble NKG2D ligands bind to NK cell NKG2D receptors, activating a false NK response and consequently creating {{competition for the}} receptor site. [...] This method of evasion occurs in prostate cancer. In addition, prostate cancer tumors can evade <b>CD8</b> <b>cell</b> recognition due {{to their ability to}} downregulate expression of MHC class 1 molecules. This example of immune evasion actually highlights NK cells' importance in tumor surveillance and response, as CD8 cells can consequently only act on tumor cells in response to NK-initiated cytokine production (adaptive immune response).|$|E
50|$|For years, lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia {{was used}} to {{describe}} hypereosinophila associated with any one of several aberrant T cell Lymphoproliferative disorders.lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia In 1987, however, a 42-yr-old male patient was described who presented with cardiac failure, mitral heart valve regurgitation, pericardial effusion, splenomegaly, kidney dysfunction, non-specific skin lesions, a 6-year history of eosinophilia, and, on admission, an eosinophil blood count of 7,150 per microliter (normal <500/microliter), a level that was 50% of total white blood cells (normal <5%). Blood smears revealed that these eosinophils {{as well as other}} white blood cells were mature and normal in appearance. Bone marrow examination revealed greatly increased eosinophils (60% of nucleated cells) in all states of maturation but with a normal karyotype; tissue biopsies revealed eosinophil infiltrates in liver and skin as well as eosinophilic vasculitis. Cell cultures from the patient's bone morrow grew an abnormally high percentage (52%) of eosinophil Colony-forming units (CFUs). Nine of 25 cell clones derived from the patient's blood T cells stimulated abnormally high (>60%) eosinophil CFUs when incubated with bone marrow cells taken from a non-identical donor; supernatant fluid taken from the patient's T cells was also active in inducing eosinophil CFUs from the non-identical donor's bone marrow cells. Immunophenotyping of these eosinophil CFU-stimulating T cells indicated that they expressed the CD4 but not <b>CD8</b> <b>cell</b> surface Cluster of differentiation antigen, suggesting that they were cytokine-secreting helper T cells. Characterization of the T cell receptor on these T cell's revealed several patterns of rearrangement in the receptor's β chains. The eosinophilia in this patient, therefore, appeared due to the expansion of a clone of T cells that secreted a factor stimulating bone marrow precursor cells to differentiate into normal eosinophils.|$|E

50|$|Identified {{the first}} cell surface antigens {{distinguishing}} cells of different lineages, introducing {{the concept of}} cell surface antigens that could differentiate different cell types. First coined TL (for “thymus-leukemia” antigen in mice) then later as the Ly series (originally named Ly-A and Ly-B and later called Ly-1, Ly-2, and Ly-3), this discovery led directly to the wide use of cell surface markers to distinguish and classify normal and malignant cells {{and the development of}} CD classification (for “clusters of differentiation”). Most notably, Dr. Old discovered the LY-B antigen, later renamed CD8 in humans. <b>CD8</b> <b>cells,</b> often referred to as “killer” T cells, are one of the major cells of the adaptive immune response, and are capable of directly killing dangerous or foreign cells (1964-1968).|$|R
25|$|The tumor {{microenvironment}} (TME) features prevents {{the recruitment of}} T cells to the tumor. Ways include chemokine CCL2 nitration, which traps T cells in the stroma. Tumor vasculature helps tumors preferentially recruit other immune cells over T cells, in part through endothelial cell (EC)–specific expression of FasL, ETBR, and B7H3. Myelomonocytic and tumor cells can up-regulate expression of PD-L1, partly driven by hypoxic conditions and cytokine production, such as IFNβ. Aberrant metabolite production in the TME, such as the pathway regulation by IDO, can affect T cell functions directly and indirectly via cells such as Tregcells. <b>CD8</b> <b>cells</b> can be suppressed by B cells regulation of TAM phenotypes. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have multiple TME functions, in part through extracellular matrix (ECM)–mediated T cell trapping and CXCL12-regulated T cell exclusion.|$|R
50|$|In HIV {{infected}} subjects, IL-21 {{has been}} reported to critically improve the HIV-specific cytotoxic T cell responses and NK cell functions. It has also been shown that HIV-specific CD4 T cells from “HIV controllers” (rare individuals who don’t progress to AIDS by controlling the virus replication without treatment) are able to produce significantly more IL-21 than those of progressors. In addition, IL-21 producing virus specific <b>CD8</b> T <b>cells</b> were also preferentially found in HIV controllers. These data and the fact that IL-21 stimulated <b>CD8</b> or NK <b>cells</b> are able to inhibit HIV viral replication in vitro, show that this cytokine could potentially be useful for anti-HIV therapeutics.|$|R
