5|$|<b>Coastal</b> batik is {{produced}} in several areas of northern Java and Madura. In contrast to inland batik, <b>coastal</b> batiks have vibrant colours and patterns inspired by {{a wide range of}} cultures as a consequence of maritime trading. Recurring motifs include European flower bouquets, Chinese phoenix, and Persian peacocks. Noted <b>coastal</b> batiks are produced in Pekalongan, Cirebon, Lasem, Tuban, and Madura. Pekalongan has the most active batik industry.|$|E
5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{development}} of the tropical depression, forecasters issued a tropical storm warning for parts of the Texas coast. When the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay, the warnings were extended from Matagorda, Texas to <b>coastal</b> Louisiana. On September 8, forecasters extended the warnings to Port Aransas, Texas, and areas from Port O'Connor to High Island, Texas were put under a hurricane watch as the storm was forecast to reach hurricane strength before making landfall. However, the hurricane watch for those areas were discontinued when Fay failed to reach hurricane strength. In addition, <b>coastal</b> Texas as well as <b>coastal</b> Louisiana were under a <b>coastal</b> flood warning, while parts of inland Texas were under flash flood warnings and flood warnings.|$|E
5|$|ECU {{houses and}} manages the UNC <b>Coastal</b> Studies Institute (UNC-CSI) {{which is an}} inter-university, marine {{research}} institute located on Roanoke Island in Manteo along the Croatan Sound on the Outer Banks, established in 2003 focusing on Estuarine Ecology and Human Health, <b>Coastal</b> Processes and Engineering, Public Policy and <b>Coastal</b> Sustainability, and Maritime Heritage.|$|E
5|$|Exmoor's {{woodlands}} sometimes {{reach the}} shoreline, especially between Porlock and Foreland Point, where they form the single longest stretch of <b>coastal</b> woodland in England and Wales. The Exmoor <b>Coastal</b> Heaths have been recognised as a Site of Special Scientific Interest {{due to the}} diversity of plant species present.|$|E
5|$|Flamininus also {{separated}} all <b>coastal</b> {{cities of}} Laconia from Spartan rule {{and placed them}} under Achean protection. The remains of Sparta's fleet were put under custody of these <b>coastal</b> cities. Nabis also had to withdraw his garrisons from Cretan cities and revoke several social and economic reforms that had strengthened Sparta's military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Grown {{males are}} known to enter {{surprisingly}} shallow bays to rest (whales will be in state of rest during these occasions). There are unique, <b>coastal</b> groups reported from various areas among the globe such as Scotland, Shiretoko Peninsula, off Kaikoura, in Davao Gulf. Such <b>coastal</b> groups were more abundant in pre-whaling days.|$|E
5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, several oil {{facilities}} were closed or placed on automatic controls. Drilling rigs as far east as the <b>coastal</b> waters off of Mississippi {{were prepared to}} evacuate in the event Edith moved further east than anticipated. Additionally, thousands evacuated <b>coastal</b> areas of Louisiana prior {{to the arrival of}} the hurricane. Several shelters opened in <b>coastal</b> cities, and many people prepared for the hurricane by purchasing emergency supplies. Officials closed schools throughout much of southern Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon {{inhabited}} a {{wide range}} of marine environments (i.e., shallow <b>coastal</b> waters, areas of <b>coastal</b> upwelling, swampy <b>coastal</b> lagoons, sandy littorals, and offshore deep water environments), and exhibited a transient lifestyle. Adult megalodon were not abundant in shallow water environments, and mostly inhabited offshore areas. Megalodon may have moved between <b>coastal</b> and oceanic waters, particularly in different stages of its life cycle. However, megalodon teeth have been excavated from regions far away from continental lands, such as the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Settlers cleared {{much of the}} Catlins' <b>coastal</b> {{vegetation}} for farmland, but in {{some areas}} the original <b>coastal</b> plant life survives, primarily around cliff edges {{and some of the}} bays close to the Tautuku Peninsula, these being furthest from the landward edges of the forest. Plant life here includes many native species adapted to the strong salt-laden winds found in this exposed region. The Catlins <b>coastal</b> daisy (Celmisia lindsayii) is unique to the region, and is related to New Zealand's mountain daisies. Tussocks, hebes, and flaxes are common, as are native gentians, though sadly the endangered native sedge pingao can now rarely be found. In years when the southern rātā flowers well, the <b>coastal</b> forest canopy turns bright red. The rātā also thrives in some inland areas.|$|E
5|$|The Command saw {{action from}} the first day of {{hostilities}} until {{the last day of the}} Second World War. It completed one million flying hours, 240,000 operations and destroyed 212 U-boats. <b>Coastal</b> Command's casualties amounted to 2,060 aircraft to all causes. From 1940 to 1945 <b>Coastal</b> Command sank 366 German transport vessels and damaged 134. The total tonnage sunk was 512,330 tons and another 513,454 tons damaged. 10,663 persons were rescued by the Command, comprising 5,721 Allied crew members, 277 enemy personnel, and 4,665 non-aircrews. 5,866 <b>Coastal</b> Command personnel were killed in action.|$|E
5|$|The Odin class, {{the seventh}} and eighth of Caprivi's {{proposed}} ten <b>coastal</b> defenders, was {{a modified version of}} the Siegfried design; the primary differences were a slightly improved armor layout, a second funnel, and two military masts. In 1888, before the two Odins were laid down, Caprivi's successor, Vice Admiral Alexander von Monts, ordered the construction of the four large battleships of the , to replace what would have been two more Odin-class <b>coastal</b> defense ships; this marked the end of Germany's <b>coastal</b> battleship program.|$|E
5|$|The Ponte Grande Bridge was {{immediately}} outside the area defended by the Italian 206 <b>Coastal</b> Division, which would oppose the British seaborne landing. The fortress commander was Rear Admiral Priamo Leonardi, with Colonel Mario Damiani {{in command of}} the army contingent. The Augusta-Syracuse Naval Fortress Area, which included the <b>Coastal</b> Division, was protected by six medium and six heavy <b>coastal</b> artillery batteries, with eleven additional dual-purpose <b>coastal</b> and anti-aircraft batteries, with six batteries only of anti-aircraft guns. Finally the Fortress contained an armoured train with four 120mm guns. The army contingent was the 121st <b>Coastal</b> Defence Regiment, which included four battalions. There were also naval and air force battalions available, while the 54 Infantry Division Napoli {{was in a position to}} send reinforcements if required.|$|E
5|$|The <b>coastal</b> areas {{bordering}} the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry summers and cool to cold, wet winters. Snow {{falls on the}} <b>coastal</b> areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in {{no more than a}} few days. However snow is rare in the <b>coastal</b> areas of the Aegean Sea and very rare in the <b>coastal</b> areas of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{littoral}} zone of Soconusco lies {{to the south}} of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and consists of a narrow <b>coastal</b> plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre. Although the entire <b>coastal</b> strip {{is often referred to as}} Soconusco, Soconusco proper is the southeastern portion characterised by a humid tropical climate and rich agricultural lands. The northwestern portion of the <b>coastal</b> strip featuring a drier climate was historically referred to as El Despoblado ("The Unpopulated"); it is generally referred to now as the Isthmus Coast Region (Spanish: Istmo-Costa).|$|E
5|$|The main <b>coastal</b> towns are, {{from the}} west to the north-east, Minehead, Watchet, Burnham-on-Sea, Weston-super-Mare, Clevedon and Portishead. The <b>coastal</b> area between Minehead and the eastern extreme of the {{administrative}} county's coastline at Brean Down is known as Bridgwater Bay, and is a National Nature Reserve.|$|E
5|$|The work of <b>Coastal</b> Command was immortalised in a 1942 wartime {{propaganda}} documentary named <b>Coastal</b> Command with a {{score by}} Ralph Vaughan Williams.|$|E
5|$|There were {{significant}} {{weaknesses in the}} KJRM prior to the invasion. One was the failure to subordinate the Naval Surveillance Command to respective sectors of Naval <b>Coastal</b> Command, and another was giving responsibility for two sectors of Naval <b>Coastal</b> Command to what were essentially training establishments.|$|E
5|$|About 500,000people {{were given}} {{evacuation}} orders in the state, mostly in <b>coastal</b> areas. Residents in Mobile County, and those south of I-10 in Baldwin County, {{were ordered to}} evacuate. Similar orders were issued in Mississippi for parts of Jackson, Hancock, and Harrison counties, and for <b>coastal</b> areas in the Florida Panhandle stretching from Escambia County to Bay County.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{for all of}} Jamaica, for Haiti from Port-au-Prince to the Dominican border, and for the Dominican Republic from Barahona to the Haitian border. Tropical Storm warnings were issued {{for the rest of}} Hispaniola and for <b>coastal</b> Cuba between Camagüey and Guantánamo. Hundreds of thousands were evacuated from vulnerable low-lying and <b>coastal</b> areas and disaster management programs were activated throughout the Greater Antilles.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to legislative reform, the breaching of <b>coastal</b> flood defense systems during Vera prompted a redesign of such mechanisms. In Nagoya, regulation {{was created for}} <b>coastal</b> construction and their heights. Development of flood defenses in Ise, Osaka, and Tokyo bays was also set into motion. The heights of such defense systems were based on worst-case scenarios and maximum storm surge heights caused by the typhoon.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of war or}} {{national}} emergency, the Naval Staff was to become directly subordinate to the Supreme Command. The Naval Staff would command the fleet, river flotilla, Maritime Air Force and Naval <b>Coastal</b> Command. All other naval establishments would remain {{under the control of}} the Navy Section of the Ministry of Army and Navy. There were a few exceptions to these general arrangements. For example, the naval detachments on Lake Ohrid and Lake Scutari were subordinated to the local army districts, and the Naval <b>Coastal</b> Command was subordinated to the Royal Yugoslav Army's <b>Coastal</b> Defence Command. In case of mobilisation, the navy would need to requisition about 250 sea-going and 25 river vessels.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of 1944 the Royal Navy sent a {{flotilla}} into the Adriatic, both to secure the area and to attack German <b>coastal</b> shipping. The <b>coastal</b> shipping became increasingly significant for the German forces deployed in the Independent State of Croatia, and especially Dalmatia—as road and rail routes became unsafe for use because of activity of the Yugoslav Partisans. To deny that option, the Royal Navy initiated Operation Exterminate, primarily aimed at destruction of German corvettes. On 26 October, the Yugoslav Partisans informed Lieutenant Commander Morgan Morgan-Giles, commander of the <b>coastal</b> forces in the north Adriatic, that there were two German destroyers in a cove on the south coast of the Rab Island.|$|E

5|$|Marine {{habitats}} can {{be divided}} horizontally into <b>coastal</b> and open ocean habitats. <b>Coastal</b> habitats extend from the shoreline {{to the edge of}} the continental shelf. Most marine life is found in <b>coastal</b> habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only 7 percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf. Alternatively, marine habitats {{can be divided}} vertically into pelagic (open water), demersal (just above the seabed), and benthic (sea bottom) habitats. A third division is by latitude: from tropical to temperate to polar waters.|$|E
5|$|Most common ravens prefer wooded {{areas with}} large expanses of open land nearby, or <b>coastal</b> regions for their nesting sites and feeding grounds. In {{some areas of}} dense human population, such as California in the United States, they take {{advantage}} of a plentiful food supply and have seen a surge in their numbers. On coasts, individuals of this species are often evenly distributed and prefer to build their nest sites along sea cliffs. Common ravens are often located in <b>coastal</b> regions because these areas provide easy access to water and a variety of food sources. Also, <b>coastal</b> regions have stable weather patterns without extreme cold or hot temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the hurricane, an {{estimated}} 20,000people evacuated the <b>coastal</b> parishes of southeastern Louisiana, including nearly all of the 2,000residents on Grand Isle. Small-scale evacuations were issued for residents living in low-lying or <b>coastal</b> areas of Mississippi and Alabama. Offshore, the threat of the hurricane prompted oil companies to evacuate employees on oil rigs to the mainland.|$|E
