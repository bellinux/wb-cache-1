5000|$|The {{earliest}} form of {{a manual}} transmission {{is thought to have}} been invented by Joe Clulow and Émile Levassor in the late 19th century. This type of transmission offered multiple gear ratios and, in most cases, reverse.

These transmissions are called sliding mesh transmissions or sometimes <b>crash</b> <b>boxes,</b> because of the difficulty in changing gears and the loud grinding sound that often accompanied.

In general, the experimental and simulation results showed similar mean load values and deformation modes. The SEA values of empty, partially and fully foam filled boxes were predicted as function of box wall thickness between 1 and 3 mm and foam filler relative density between 0 and 0. 2, using the analytical equations developed for the mean crushing loads.

40|$|Abstract: Vehicle {{collision}} {{also known}} as crash or vehicle accident is a dynamic phenomenon and occurs when a vehicle collides with another vehicle, or any other stationary or moving object. It may result in injury, death and property damage. <b>Crash</b> <b>box,</b> with which a car is equipped at {{the front end of}} its front side frame, {{is one of the most}} important automotive parts for crash energy absorption. In case of frontal crash accident, for example, <b>crash</b> <b>box</b> is expected to be collapsed with absorbing crash energy prior to the other body parts so that the damage of the main cabin frame is minimized and passengers are saved. Conventionally, a <b>crash</b> <b>box</b> is equipped with several ditches called as ―crash beads, so that those crash beads may initiate buckling deformation and make the <b>crash</b> <b>box</b> easily collapse. Recently, it has been strictly required to satisfy both reduction of body weight and improvement of crash worthiness in the design and thus, regarding <b>crash</b> <b>box,</b> it is required to ensure high energy absorption using sheet as thin as possible.

40|$|Abstract. Current crash {{structures}} in cars are still using the buckling of metallic structures {{to absorb the}} kinetic energy {{in case of an}} impact. The disadvantage of this technology is that changes within the static structural behaviour, like e. g. the stiffness or eigenfrequencies, will cause changes in the crash behaviour, even if this is not desired. This correlation between static and dynamic behaviour causes many development loops to adjust the crash behaviour, e. g. through optimizing trigger geometries which lower the initial crash forces. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) - Institute of Vehicle Concepts has developed a novel method to offer an efficient way of absorbing energy by peeling the outer skin of load bearing structures, like the <b>crash</b> <b>boxes</b> and the longitudinal rails. This technology provides an adjustable force level without changing the static behaviour of the front structure itself. This property offers the opportunity to create adaptable crash behaviour with only smallest changes within the peeling depth. Furthermore, it is possible to generate close to ideal force-deflection curves, which offers the potential to achieve high specific energy absorption. The DLR will show results of static and dynamic testing of crash tubes and of a vehicle front structure equipped with this mechanism. In addition the implementation of the methodology into the dynamic simulation with LS-Dyna will be shown. Benefits and limitations of this novel energy absorption method will be discussed...|$|R

Precipitation of Mg 2 Si due to different cooling rates affects the material properties such as crash performance, thus the aluminum alloy used is sensitive to different cooling rates. In order to perform tests with different cooling rates a cooling rig was constructed. In order to evaluate the different cooling rates both mechanical testing such as tensile test and 3 -point bending test and compression test were performed. Also analyses with scanning electron microscope/energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy were performed to estimate grain boundary decoration of Mg 2 Si due to the different cooling rates. Furthermore LOM analyses were performed to evaluate if the experimental setup had any effect on material properties such as grain size. The constructed cooling rig produced different cooling rates with reliable repeatability as intended. Cooling rates between 130 ̊C/s and 20 ̊C/s were accomplished. Mg 2 Si occurred in all investigated test samples with various amounts. Higher cooling rates decreases the precipitation of Mg 2 Si to the grain boundaries, higher cooling rates also increased the bending angle achieved from the 3 -point bending test. Furthermore, extensive solution heat treatment at elevated temperatures leads to grain growth. ...|$|R
