Materials and Instruments 1. 1 / 8 or 1 / 4 -inch diameter, seamless copper tubing, brass tubing, or galvanized pipe with a suitable pipe tee for connecting an altitude or pressure gauge. Flexible plastic tubing also can be used, but is less desirable. 2. <b>Calibrated</b> <b>altitude</b> or pressure gauge, and spare gauges. Gauges that are filled with either oil or silicone work best and are most durable. 3. Compressed air source and corresponding valve stem, usually a Schrader valve. A tire pump {{can be used on}} shallow wells and piezometers, but a more substantial source of compressed air is needed where depth to water is hundreds of feet. 4. Small open-end wrench 5. Wire or electrician’s tape 6. A steel tape graduated in feet, tenths and hundredths of feet 7. Blue carpenter’s chalk 8. Clean rag 9. Field noteboo...|$|E
50|$|Mean {{sea level}} (MSL) (abbreviated simply sea level) is an average {{level of the}} surface {{of one or more}} of Earth's oceans from which heights such as {{elevations}} may be measured. MSL is a type of vertical datuma standardised geodetic reference pointthat is used, for example, as a chart datum in cartography and marine navigation, or, in aviation, as the standard sea level at which atmospheric pressure is measured in order to <b>calibrate</b> <b>altitude</b> and, consequently, aircraft flight levels. A common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular location.|$|R
40|$|Earth-looking {{satellites}} must be calibrated {{in order}} to quantitatively measure and monitor components of land, water and atmosphere of the Earth system. The inevitable change in performance due to the stress of satellite launch requires that the calibration of a satellite sensor be established and validated on-orbit. A new approach to on-orbit satellite sensor calibration has been developed using the flight of a high <b>altitude</b> <b>calibrated</b> airborne imaging spectrometer below a multi-spectral satellite sensor...|$|R
5000|$|At {{high speeds}} and <b>altitudes,</b> <b>calibrated</b> {{airspeed}} must be further corrected for compressibility error to give equivalent airspeed (EAS). Compressibility error arises because the impact pressure {{will cause the}} air to compress in the pitot tube. The calibration equation (see calibrated airspeed) accounts for compressibility, but only at standard sea level pressure. At other altitudes compressibility error correction may be obtained from a chart. In practice compressibility error is negligible below about 3,000 m / 10,000 feet and 100 m/s / 200 knots CAS.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the flight}} deck, the display units {{are the most}} obvious parts of an EFIS system, and are the {{features}} {{that lead to the}} term glass cockpit. The display unit that replaces the ADI is called the primary flight display (PFD). If a separate display replaces the HSI, it is called the navigation display. The PFD displays all information critical to flight, including <b>calibrated</b> airspeed, <b>altitude,</b> heading, attitude, vertical speed and yaw. The PFD is designed to improve a pilot's situational awareness by integrating this information into a single display instead of six different analog instruments, reducing the amount of time necessary to monitor the instruments. PFDs also increase situational awareness by alerting the aircrew to unusual or potentially hazardous conditions [...] - [...] for example, low airspeed, high rate of descent [...] - [...] by changing the color or shape of the display or by providing audio alerts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: There are {{two phases}} to the polar {{alignment}} problem. First one must quantify the alignment error for each axis. Once alignment error is known the mount must {{be adjusted to}} correct for this error. Often the adjustment amount must be estimated based on {{the magnitude of the}} error. This is primarily {{due to the fact that}} most mount manufacturers do not provide or <b>calibrate</b> the <b>altitude</b> and azimuth axes with high precision scales. This article will show a simple method utilizing a calculated star offset position to make the mount adjustment. The star offset position is calculated based on the known celestial coordinates of a reference star and the alignment error such that pointing the telescope at this coordinate and adjusting the mount to recenter the reference star will bring the mount into close alignment. This method is called “star offset positioning ” and should greatly reduce the amount of time to perform the alignment procedure. Overview In Measuring Polar Axis Alignment Error [1] we discussed various methods to measure the polar alignment error. If the mount were designed with encoders on the altitude and azimuth adjustment axes, or if these were calibrated with an accurate visual scale, the adjustment to th...|$|R
40|$|A high {{altitude}} airplane {{has been used}} to obtain the outer space short circuit current of solar cells. The solar cells are mounted in a collimating tube and are measured at approximately 5000 foot intervals between 12, 000 and 47, 000 feet. The air mass is calculated for each altitude using the standard formula and the resulting curve is extrapolated to air mass zero. The effects on the solar cell output of a haze layer located at the tropopause has been observed. It is necessary to fly above this layer to ensure accurate results. Airplane calibrations of several primary standard cells <b>calibrated</b> on high <b>altitude</b> balloons show agreement within 0. 5 per cent. Prediction of the output of satellite power supplies using airplane calibrated cells shows an accuracy of better than 1 per cent...|$|R

Understanding groundwater conditions in the upland parts of volcanic island aquifers is critical for sustainable groundwater development in these resource-limited environments. Yet groundwater conditions in such settings are generally difficult to characterize because of sparse well drilling (high cost and/or limited access). Information needed for resource evaluation includes upland depth to water, recharge rate, and aquifer permeability. In this study, noble-gas recharge temperatures and coupled heat/fluid flow modeling are used to indirectly infer these groundwater conditions. Mosteiros Basin on Fogo Island of the Cape Verde archipelago was selected as a representative volcanic island aquifer. Simulation results are <b>calibrated</b> to water-table <b>altitude</b> and temperature data, along with indirect information provided by noble and dissolved gases. Results of numerical modeling are most sensitive to recharge rates and hydraulic conductivity, less sensitive to basal heat flux, and not sensitive to porosity and thermal conductivity. Simulation results show that only a relatively narrow range of combined recharge values (12 – 25 % of precipitation) and hydraulic conductivity (10 ⁻⁸– 10 ⁻⁷ m s⁻¹) is consistent with observed data. The simulated recharge of 3 – 6 million cubic meters per year (Mm³ yr⁻¹) is much higher than measured discharge from the basin (0. 25 Mm³ yr⁻¹), indicating the occurrence of significant amounts of submarine groundwater discharge. The modeling results suggest a very deep upland water table located 600 – 1000 m beneath the floor of the central caldera, although the water table becomes more shallow and accessible towards the coast. Perhaps most significant is the dominant role that modest amounts of recharge (mean rates of 70 – 140 mm yr⁻¹) plays in decreasing the geothermal gradient, resulting in relatively cool temperatures in the deep vadose and at the water table. Noble-gas recharge temperatures, constrained by numerical simulation results, range from about 15 to 22 °C and indicate a large water-table temperature lapse of about − 15 °C/km, much steeper than typical adiabatic lapse rates...|$|R
