5|$|MFP {{funding has}} been frozen {{at the same}} rate for two years. In 2010, the Louisiana Legislature moved to restructure the MFP formula. <b>Critics</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> formula does not {{encourage}} districts to implement taxes to pay higher amounts than the state for the cost of education.|$|E
5|$|<b>Critics</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> MFP formula discourages {{high levels}} of local, rather than state, funding. Louisiana House Speaker Jim Tucker said in an {{interview}} with Louisiana Public Broadcasting that the MFP formula keeps districts from levying higher taxes because districts with high local taxes receive lower state funding payments. Tulane University's Cowen Institute was founded in 2007 to examine the effects of local tax initiatives on the MFP. Tara O'Neill, Cowen Institute Policy Manager, said districts receive extra incentive funding from the state when they raise high amounts of funding at the local level. O'Neill said districts get this extra money whether they tax a low tax base at a high rate or tax a healthy tax base at a low rate.|$|E

25|$|By July 2011 {{violence}} became at {{a record}} high in the insurgency. In late July 2011, NATO troops also handed control of Mazar-i-Sharif to local forces amid rising security fears just days after it {{was hit by a}} deadly bombing. Mazar-i-Sharif is the sixth of seven areas to transition to Afghan control, but <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> timing is political and there is skepticism over Afghan abilities to combat the Taliban insurgency.|$|E
25|$|A second {{dilemma for}} U.S. {{democracy}} promotion in the MENA region is aid prioritization. <b>Critics</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> priorities of Western aid {{must be viewed}} as a whole, and therefore question the vastly greater amounts spent on military aid than democracy aid. Massive foreign aid to countries like Jordan and Egypt, for example, gives regimes the ability to both co-opt and repress their populations by supporting state job and economic infrastructures and funding state security apparatuses. This results in often contradictory U.S. positions on democracy, with officials praising Arab security structures that are used to crack down on activists and civil society while simultaneously funding technical assistance aimed at promoting democracy in Egypt and Palestine for example.|$|E
25|$|However, some {{observers}} claim the merger {{has not had}} positive results. Critics argue that local FEA unions are less effective in collective bargaining, local and state annual dues are too high, young teachers are reluctant to join their local affiliates, and neither the state association nor local unions have done much to protect under-performing teachers from being fired. These <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> association is increasingly frozen out of politics {{in a state where}} Republicans control both the executive and legislative branches of government, and has made little headway in convincing the public that the candidates it backs are worth electing or the policies it supports are worth enacting. FEA supporters counter that the federation has proven effective despite these odds, and remains a force in state politics. They point to the federation's king-making role in the state's 2002 Democratic gubernatorial primary, where the union's candidate (Bill McBride) defeated a better-known and funded candidate (Janet Reno) and ran a strong campaign against a popular, wealthy incumbent (Gov. Jeb Bush).|$|E

5000|$|On July 22, 2014, Fallujah {{released}} {{their second}} album The Flesh Prevails on Unique Leader Records. The album was released while the band {{participated in the}} 2014 Summer Slaughter tour alongside Morbid Angel, The Faceless, Dying Fetus and Thy Art is Murder. The album received significant acclaim, despite some <b>critics</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> production {{was a victim of}} the [...] "Loudness Wars" [...] and little dynamic range.|$|R

500|$|Prior to the Enron scandal, McKinsey helped it {{shift from}} an {{oil and gas}} {{production}} company into an electric commodities trader, which led to significant growth in profits and revenues. According to The Independent, there was [...] "no suggestion that McKinsey was complicit in the subsequent scandal, [...] <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> arrogance of Enron's leaders is emblematic of the McKinsey culture." [...] The government did not investigate McKinsey, who said they did not provide advice on Enron's accounting, but some questioned whether McKinsey knew about Enron's accounting problems or ignored warning signs.|$|E
500|$|Organizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society {{campaign}} against the practice of keeping cetaceans, particularly killer whales, in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60–90% of male killer whales. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s. In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years. Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales' social groups are foreign {{to those found in}} the wild. Captive life is also stressful due the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behavior, as well as restricting pool size. Wild killer whales may travel up to [...] in a day, and <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity. Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress. Dolphins are often trained to do several anthropomorphic behaviors, including waving and kissing—behaviors wild dolphins would rarely do.|$|E

2500|$|In Shi'a sources, even in {{historical}} works of Al-Shaykh al-Saduq, {{the birth of}} the twelfth Imam was miraculous which must be considered as hagiography. Aside from Shi'i works almost nothing is known about the life of the twelfth Imam. Some even cast doubt on his existence. This is because Abbasids were crushing every revolt of Alids which caused al-Askari to hide the child' birth on 255/868 and just close companions get informed of the birth. However, this belief has long been criticized. <b>Critics</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> occultation of the 12th Imam [...] "became subsequent orthodox doctrine" [...] after none of the competing theories that sought to explain the succession to a childless 11th Imam [...] "seemed satisfactory".

2500|$|Eventually the CIA's {{involvement}} with the coup was exposed. This caused controversy within the organization and the CIA congressional hearings of the 1970s.

The extent of this [...] "blowback," [...] over time, was not completely clear to the CIA, as they had an inaccurate picture of the stability of the Shah's regime. The Iranian Revolution of 1979 caught the CIA and the US very much off guard (as CIA reporting a mere month earlier predicted no imminent insurrectionary turbulence whatsoever for the Shah's regime), and resulted in the overthrow of the Shah by a fundamentalist faction opposed to the US, headed by Ayatollah Khomeini. In retrospect, not only did the CIA and the US underestimate the extent of popular discontent for the Shah, but much of that discontent historically stemmed from the removal of Mosaddegh and the subsequent clientelism of the Shah.|$|E
