50|$|If two {{cards are}} drawn with {{replacement}} from {{a deck of}} cards, the event of drawing a red <b>card</b> <b>on</b> the first trial and that of drawing a red <b>card</b> <b>on</b> the second trial are independent. By contrast, if two cards are drawn without replacement from a deck of cards, the event of drawing a red <b>card</b> <b>on</b> the first trial and that of drawing a red <b>card</b> <b>on</b> the second trial are not independent, because a deck that has had a red card removed has proportionately fewer red cards.|$|R

However, five-year-old children are able to sort cards based on one dimension and can then switch to sorting <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> a second dimension.|$|E

5|$|Director Jewison can put his <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> the table, let {{his camera}} cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a tricky shot into a side pocket {{undoubtedly}} offers more range. Kid {{also has a}} less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E

F-Zero AX content is also unlockable by progressing through GXs tougher challenges.

5|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{photograph}} the corpse for the naval identity card Martin would have to carry, but the results were unsatisfactory, and {{it was obvious that}} the images were of a cadaver. Montagu and Cholmondeley conducted a search for people who resembled the corpse, finding Captain Ronnie Reed of MI5; Reed agreed to be photographed for the identity card, wearing Royal Marine uniform. As the three cards and passes needed looked too new for a long-serving officer, they were issued as recent replacements for lost originals. Montagu spent the next few weeks rubbing all three <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> his trousers to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to the uniform, it was worn by Cholmondeley, who was about the same build. The only non-issue part to the uniform was the underwear, which was in short supply in war-rationed Britain, so a pair of good-quality woollen underwear, owned by the late Herbert Fisher, the Warden of New College, Oxford, was used.|$|E

After five months away from boxing, Woodhouse returned to the ring for his second fight on 15 April, defeating Duncan Cottier on points after four rounds. On 1 May, he signed a new two-year deal with Rushden & Diamonds. He then defeated Peter Dunn in a bout on 3 June, again on points, in a contest of four three-minute rounds. In his fourth fight on 5 December 2007, he defeated Craig Tomes by way of knock-out after just 1 minute and 57 seconds, landing a left hook that unsettled Tomes as the referee decided his opponent as unfit to continue. Matt Seawright was Woodhouse's next boxing opponent on 16 March 208, he defeated him after Seawright felt {{he was unable to}} continue after the third round. Woodhouse finished the 2007–08 football season having played in 29 Conference National matches, scoring once and receiving two red <b>cards.</b> <b>On</b> 17 May, Woodhouse achieved his sixth straight victory, maintaining his undefeated record against Dave Murray at Bramall Lane, defeating his opponent by knock-out in the second round. Murray managed to beat the standing eight count, but the referee deemed him unable to continue after 1 minute and 23 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Tetra Master is a card-based minigame {{that can}} be {{initiated}} with various non-playable characters in the field. Players assemble a deck of five cards, which can be obtained via chests, given as a reward, or earned from fighting monsters. Each card has various arrows which point to the four sides and {{four corners of the}} card, and various stats that vary between cards, with rarer cards being more powerful. Players take it in turns to strategically place <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> a 4x4 playing grid based on the available directions. Battles can occur when players place a card next to another card, depending on where the player places it. If the defending card has no arrows whilst the attacking card has an arrow pointing towards it, that card is placed under the player's control. When two arrows meet with each other, the cards do battle based on their point values, with the losing card coming under the winning player's control, sometimes triggering combos that put multiple cards in the winner's control. After all cards are played, the winner is the player who has the most cards under their control, with a draw occurring if they have the same number of cards. The winning player may choose a card from their opponent's deck out of the ones they put under their control. If the winning player scores a perfect win however, in which all ten cards are put under their control, they will win all five cards from the opponent's deck.|$|E
