25|$|However, {{in nature}} the {{electromagnetic}} field is coupled to charged particles, such as electrons. The QFT describing {{the interactions of}} photons and charged particles is quantum electrodynamics (QED), and this theory is not scale-invariant. We <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> from the QED beta-function. This {{tells us that the}} electric charge (which is the coupling parameter in the theory) increases with increasing energy. Therefore, while the quantized electromagnetic field without charged particles is scale-invariant, QED is not scale-invariant.|$|E

25|$|In the {{reference}} {{frame of the}} interface between two surfaces, static friction does no work, because there is never displacement between the surfaces. In the same reference frame, kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the motion, and does negative work. However, friction can do positive work in certain frames of reference. One <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> by placing a heavy box on a rug, then pulling on the rug quickly. In this case, the box slides backwards relative to the rug, but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary. Thus, the kinetic friction between the box and rug accelerates the box {{in the same direction}} that the box moves, doing positive work.|$|E
25|$|The Young King's {{contemporary}} reputation, however, was by {{no means}} so negative. This {{had much to do with}} his place in the enthusiastic tournament culture of his own day. We <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> from his appearances in the History of William Marshal, the biography of the knight assigned to him as a tutor in 1170, and who became his tournament team leader until 1182. The History depicts him as constantly moving from one tournament to another across northern and central France between 1175 and 1182. With his cousins, Philip, Count of Flanders, and Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut, Flanders and Namur, he was one of the key patrons of the sport. He is said to have spent over £200 a day on the great retinue of knights he brought to the tournament of Lagny-sur-Marne in November 1179.|$|E
500|$|The taijitu ( [...] ; {{commonly}} known as the [...] "yin and yang symbol" [...] or simply the [...] "yin yang") and the bagua 八卦 ("Eight Trigrams") have importance in Taoist symbolism. In this cosmology, the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy, organized into the cycles of Yin and Yang and formed into objects and lives. Yin is the receptive and Yang is the active principle, seen in all forms change and difference such as the annual season cycles, the landscape, sexual coupling, the formation of both men and women as characters, and sociopolitical history. While almost all Taoist organizations make use of it, one could also regard it as Confucian, Neo-Confucian or pan-Chinese. One <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> symbol as a decorative element on Taoist organization flags and logos, temple floors, or stitched into clerical robes. According to Song dynasty sources, it originated around the 10th century CE. Previously, a tiger and a dragon had symbolized yin and yang.|$|E

500|$|The single reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on December 20, 1910. The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "Here is a rather exaggerated farce with a good many laughs in it. It has for its basis recent cartoons, but has original treatment. The male members of the cast seemed to enjoy their roles, perhaps {{for the reason that}} it is a man's picture; the laugh seems on the ladies." [...] A more contemporary analysis of the film was covered in a paper by Eric Dewberry, who credits this film as Thanhouser's first film portraying suffragists. Dewberry writes that the film presents the idea of a woman mayor, something which was not farfetched for women to find to be humorous. Despite Jack's lack of power in the new era which he awakes to, he managed to win the heart of a powerful woman and easily restore the rights of men. Taken one way, the film seems to advance the idea that a women of power are controlled by their hearts. Dewing writes, [...] "On the one hand it mocks many female suffrage [...] "fighting tactics," [...] as suffragists, in an attempt to not appear too extremist and alienable, exploited conservative ideas of feminine virtue in order to assert their citizenship and reform desires. In the film, the man assumes effeminate passions to woo the Mayor. On the other hand, those sympathetic to the cause <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> as proof that these tactics can work in politics. The film also toys with the fears men harbored concerning the loss of power over females in public spaces, a threat to masculinity and manhood." [...] The film is also believed to have been the first adaptation of Curwood's work.|$|E

[...] One <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> without knowing the aforementioned fact about G-delta sets: the continued fraction expansion of an irrational number defines a homeomorphism from the space of irrationals to the space of all sequences of positive integers, which is easily seen to be completely metrizable.|$|E

2500|$|The modernists, in general, use a {{subjective}} language. Martí's stylistic creed {{is part of}} the necessity to de-codify the logic rigor and the linguistic construction and to eliminate the intellectual, abstract and systematic expression. There is the deliberate intention and awareness to expand the expressive system of the language. The style changes the form of thinking. Without falling into unilateralism, Martí values the expression because language is an impression and a feeling through the form. Modernism mostly searches for the visions and realities, the expression takes in the impressions, the state of mind, without reflection and without concept. This is the law of subjectivity. We <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> in works of Martí, one of the first modernists, who conceives the literary task like an invisible unity, an expressive totality, considering the style like [...] "a form of the content" [...] (forma del contenido).|$|E
2500|$|MacMillan was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in August 1915. Due to him not being 19, he was posted to the 3rd Battalion, Argylls, a training unit, stationed near Edinburgh. In April 1916 {{he was sent to}} the Western Front where he joined the 2nd Battalion (the 93rd), a Regular Army unit which was then serving as part of the 98th Brigade of the 33rd Division, in Northeast France, and immediately became involved in fierce trench warfare at Brickstacks. This was followed by engagements, as part of the battles of the Somme and Passchendaele, at Cuinchy, Bazentin-le-Petit, High Wood, Mametz Wood, Arras, Le Cateau and the Selle. While still only 19 years old and a second lieutenant, he was appointed acting adjutant of the battalion in November 1916. He was promoted to lieutenant in April 1917, and formally confirmed as Adjutant in June. He remained in this post {{for the rest of the}} war, serving seven different commanding officers (CO). The casualties were immense and, at one time, while a second lieutenant, he found himself by default commanding the battalion. MacMillan wrote [...] "I would say that I was fortunate to belong to the best battalion in the Army, with an unbreakable spirit. You <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> from the record of their operations – and then look at the casualty list: 63 officers and 1175 men killed, and ready for anything at the end of it all".|$|E
