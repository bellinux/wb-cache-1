2500|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered with the Mark I Cell was that its performance was reduced if the feed rate to the cell varied, which was a common occurrence arising from normal fluctuations in operating concentrators.

Thus, when {{the production of the}} feed stream to the Jameson Cell decreased {{as a result of a}} fluctuation elsewhere in the concentrator, a higher percentage of the tailings was automatically recycled to the downcomers, producing a constant flow rate, hence feed pressure, to the cell.

40|$|It was {{identified}} that clay minerals adversely affect fine <b>coal</b> <b>flotation</b> through slime coatings. In the study, {{it was interesting}} to find that an anionic polymer dispersant, lignosulfonate, successfully mitigated the negative effect of clay minerals in <b>coal</b> <b>flotation</b> using fresh water, but in saline water, it exacerbated <b>coal</b> <b>flotation.</b> In order to understand the mechanisms underpinning the different behaviour of lignosulfonate in <b>coal</b> <b>flotation</b> using fresh and saline water, the adsorption isotherm, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were conducted in this study. While DLS monitored the molecular conformation change (swelling or shrinking) of the polymer in fresh and saline water, adsorption isotherms enabled polymer adsorbed amount on clay and coal mineral surfaces to be determined. It was found that lignosulfonate adsorbed on the coal and clay mineral surfaces providing effective electrostatic repulsions and resulting in a mitigation of clay minerals from coal surfaces in deionised water. In the presence of saline water, however, polymer molecular conformation changed. Polymer molecules were compressed and adsorbed in form of aggregates. The adsorption amount of lignosulfonate on clay minerals increased in saline water. A low dosage of lignosulfonate could not provide sufficient electrosteric repulsion to disperse clay minerals. Moreover, the high adsorption amount of the polymer on coal and clay surfaces led to a more hydrophilic coal surface, and <b>coal</b> <b>flotation</b> was therefore depressed in saline water.

Possible methods of fine tailings usage are also presented. Results of research of fine tailings from three coal slurry impoundments of energetic <b>coal,</b> one <b>flotation</b> tailings pond of cocking coal and one water pond are shown.

The results of research show that it is possible to reprocess flotation tailings stored for a long time in a pond using again flotation methods. It is necessary however to choose the right froth agent and its proper concentration in a process. It was also demonstrated that tailings deposited in a water pond have properties that allow their energetic usage.

Unlike a conventional enhanced gravity concentrator, which rotates to produce a centrifugal field requiring more energy, the EG Float Cell is fed with a tangential feed slurry to generate an enhanced gravity field without any rotating part.

Flotation was carried out with a newly designed flotation cell refurbished from an old ultrasonic cleaning bath (2. 5 L volume) equipped with a single frequency (35 kHz) and two different power levels (80 – 160 W) and a sub-aeration-type flotation machine operating at a stable impeller speed (1200 rpm) and air rate (2. 5 L/min). The reagent combination for conventional and simultaneous ultrasonic <b>coal</b> <b>flotation</b> tests was Ekofol- 440 at variable dosages (40 – 300 g/t) with controlling water temperature (20 – 25 °C) at natural pH (6. 5 – 7. 0). The batch <b>coal</b> <b>flotation</b> results were analyzed by comparing the combustible recovery (%) and separation efficiency (%) values, taking mass yield and ash concentrations of the froths and tailings into account. It was found that simultaneous ultrasonic <b>coal</b> <b>flotation</b> increased yield and recovery values of the floated products with lower ash values than the conventional flotation despite using similar reagent dosages. Furthermore, particle size distribution of the ultrasonically treated and untreated coals was measured. Finely distributed coal particles seemed to be agglomerated during the ultrasonic treatment, while ash-forming slimes were removed by hydrodynamic cavitation...|$|E

40|$|The {{previous}} {{study indicates that}} both reagent usage and the variation of water conductivity affect froth stability and therefore <b>coal</b> <b>flotation</b> behavior. In this study, Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD) was conducted to investigate the interaction of saline water with collector (diesel) and frother (MIBC) in controlling froth stability which was indicated by air recovery. The results show that a significant interaction (see footnote 1) existed between flotation reagents and water conductivity, which affected froth stability, combustible matter recovery and the mineral matter content of flotation concentrate. Frother and salt ions had a joint action in producing a more stable froth. On the other hand, collector and salt ions had a joint action in reducing the combustible matter content of flotation concentrate and the combustible matter recovery. A methodology was developed to avoid overly stable froth and maximize <b>coal</b> <b>flotation</b> performance by adjusting reagent additions based on water conductivity...|$|E
40|$|Coal in {{the finer}} {{particle}} size ranges (below 1 mm) has always suffered from poor cleaning efficiencies. This {{problem has been}} exacerbated in recent years with the increased amount of high ash fines due to continuous mining machines and the mining of dirtier coal seams. In the present work, it is proposed to improve overall plant efficiencies by processing coarser <b>coal</b> in column <b>flotation</b> than is now commonly treated by that method. Column <b>flotation</b> for coarse <b>coal</b> is supported by actual lab and plant test data that result in a full-scale column plant installation. The fundamentals of coarse particle detachment from bubbles are reviewed and a new simplified model is developed which better handles cubical and rectangular coal particles. Much of the lower efficiency of fine coal cleaning is due to poor size separation of the fine-sized raw coal which results in misplaced high ash fines reporting to the coarser size streams. By sending coarser material to column flotation, the finest size separation {{that takes place in}} a plant can be as coarse as 0. 5 mm or greater. The proper use of wash water in a flotation column then becomes the best mechanism for desliming of the high ash clays. This work quantifies the benefits of removing the high ash fines from the plant product and increasing overall plant yield by increasing the amount of near-gravity coarse material. The resulting yield gain is greater than that obtained from only the increased fine coal recovery. Methods of column operation for improved coarse coal recovery are also evaluated. ii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Great appreciation is expressed to my advisor, Dr. Roe-Hoan Yoon, for his encouragement and guidance throughout the duration of this investigation.

40|$|The {{presence}} of sulphur in coal possesses important environmetal problems in its usage. The sulphur dioxide (S 02) emissions produced during coal combustion {{account for a}} significant proportion of the total global output of anthropogenic SO 2. The extent of sulphur separation depends on several variables such as the form of sulphur in coal, intimacy of contact between minerals and the products of devolatilization. The total sulphur in coal varies in the range of 0. 2 - 11 wt %, although in most cases it is beetwen 1 and 3 wt %. Sulphur occurs in a variety of both inorganic and organic forms. Inorganic sulphur is found mainly as iron pyrite, marcasite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopirite and as sulphates (rarely exceeds w = 0, 1 %). Organic sulphur is found in aromatic rings and aliphatic functionalities usually as mercaptans, aliphatic and aryl sulfides, disulfides and thiophenes. Organic and pyritic sulphur quantities depend on coal rank. Higher rank coals tend to have a high proportion of labile sulphur. All the organic sulphur is bivalent and it is spread throughout the organic coal matrix. Sulphur occurs in all the macerals and most minerals. Vitrinite contains the major part of organic sulphur and metals. Elemental sulphur is produced during coal weathering. The depolymerization methods as pyrolysis and hydrogenation are very drastic methods wich change the structure of the coal and the sulphur groups. In the case of pyrolysis, high levels of desulphurization, in chars and additional production of liquid hydrocarbon can be achieved. Thiophenes and sulphides were the major sulphur components of tars from coal pyrolysis. Hyrdogen sulphide and the lower mercaptans and sulphides were found in the volatile matters. Hydrogen sulphide and thiophenes are practically the only sulphur products of coal hydrogenation. H 2 S is produced in char hydrodesulphurization. A number of options are available for reducing sulphur emissions including the utilisation of coals with low sulphur concentrations (typically < 1 wt %), the removal of cleaning prior to utilisation. The methods for the removal of sulphur from coal can be divided into: physical, chemical and microbiological. The mineral sulphur components can be removed or reduced by commercial methods of <b>coal</b> washing, <b>flotation</b> and agglomeration. A number of chemical desulphurization for the removal of, both, pyritic and organic sulphur have been advocated. The chemical desulphurization methods however, have two major drawbacks. Namely, they are often expensive and they destroy the caking properties of coal. Certain microorganisms have been used to consume or convert selectively most of the pyritic sulphur {{as well as some of}} the organic sulphur in coal. The process is also cheaper than chemical desulphurization and does not affect the caking properties of coking coal...|$|R
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. Acidic {{drainage}} as {{a result}} of mining and mineral processing activities is a growing concern. The effects of Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) include environmental pollution in the affected areas and beyond. As South Africa has water challenges, the potential threat of continual depletion of useable water resources through their contamination by ARD and other mining activities may affect economic productivity, as well as quality of life. Currently used ARD remediation measures are variable and costly, not only in South Africa but worldwide. End of pipe approaches such as treatment by neutralisation fail {{to reduce the risk of}} ARD generation and provide long term solutions. Further it fails to address the limited resource utilisation of the byproduct materials, currently disposed of as ARD forming wastes. The Department of Chemical Engineering, at UCT, has focused research onto the prevention of ARD generation and minimisation of waste. One approach proposed is the two stage froth flotation process for separating sulphides, responsible for ARD formation, from the remaining tailings, leaving these benign with respect to ARD. Testwork results have proven its technical feasibility using porphyry copper tailings, fine coal and more recently gold tailings. Historically, ultrafine coal was not treated by most collieries in South Africa, but disposed as waste. Oxidation of the pyrite in the coal leads to generation of acidic water. In this project, an economic analysis of the <b>coal</b> two stage <b>flotation</b> process for the mitigation of ARD formation is considered. This project proposes ARD prevention by desulphurisation of sulphide rich waste coal material as an in-process approach which can be incorporated into mineral process flowsheets or as an add-on process for desulphurisation of old workings. The two stage flotation may yield a valuable mineral or coal product, as well as a low volume sulphide rich fraction which can be processed further to yield sulphuric acid or disposed of with containment and a benign tailings fraction which can be used as cover material or disposed conventionally...|$|R
