50|$|From the {{cognitive}} perspective, the brain perceives auditory stimuli as music according to gestalt principles, or “principles of grouping.” Gestalt principles include proximity, similarity, closure, and continuation.

We seek to test this claim empirically, exploiting the timing and unique properties of state level medical marijuana laws in the US to isolate policy signalling effects. We use survey-derived state-level estimates of youths’ marijuana risk-perceptions and use prevalence, and find evidence of signalling effects on aggregate risk-perceptions of marijuana use that correspond to the introduction of medical marijuana laws. These effects, however, do not conform to what reform opponents predict - medical marijuana provisions appear to send the ‘right’ message. Further, we find no robust effects on nonmedical marijuana use. Medical marijuana, drug policy, ballot initiatives, policy signalling...|$|R

Participants judged the distance to targets after observing an actor reach to an otherwise unreachable target with a tool (Experiment 1) or illuminate a distant target with a laser pointer (Experiment 2). Observing either type of inter-action caused a compression of perceived space, revealing that a person’s perception of space can be altered through mere observation.

40|$|Abstract. In tuple space {{approaches}} to context-aware mobile systems, {{the notion of}} context {{is defined by the}} presence or absence of certain tuples in the tuple space. Existing approaches define such presence either by collocation of devices holding the tuples or by replication of those tuples across all devices. We show that both approaches can lead to an erroneous perception of context. The former ties the perception of context to network connectivity which does not always yield the expected result. The latter <b>causes</b> context <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> even if a device has left that context a long time ago. We propose a tuple space approach in which tuples themselves carry a predicate that determines whether they are in the right context or not. We present a practical API for our approach and show its use by means of the implementation of a mobile game. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{patient with}} a {{unilateral}} conductive hearing loss would hear the tuning fork loudest in the affected ear. This is because the ear with the conductive hearing loss is only receiving input from the bone conduction and no air conduction, and the sound <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> as louder in that ear. This finding is because the conduction problem {{of the middle ear}} (incus, malleus, stapes, and eustachian tube) masks the ambient noise of the room, while the well-functioning inner ear (cochlea with its basilar membrane) picks the sound up via the bones of the skull, <b>causing</b> it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as a louder sound in the affected ear. Another theory, however, is based on the occlusion effect described by Tonndorf et al. in 1966. Lower frequency sounds (as made by the 256 Hz fork) that are transferred through the bone to the ear canal escape from the canal. If an occlusion is present, the sound cannot escape and appears louder on the ear with the conductive hearing loss.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT—Human visual {{perception}} is sometimes ambig-uous, switching between different perceptual structures, and shifts of attention sometimes favor one perceptual structure over another.

Here, we show that this attention effect can be reversed under certain conditions. To account for these phenomena, we propose an alternative principle: The vi-sual system chooses the interpretation that maximizes simplicity of the attended regions. The visual system <b>is</b> able <b>to</b> discern complex three-dimensional structures in scenes, {{even in the absence}} of any simple and straightforward mapping between properties of the retinal input and objects in the distal scene.

40|$|Excerpt] Human Resources has an {{identity}} crisis. The HR function is increasingly called upon <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a strategic business partner but this role is often {{in conflict with}} HR’s long-held identity as the firm’s employee advocate. Contemporary Strategic Human Resource Management (SHRM) initiatives seek to maximize human capital, align strategic fit throughout an organization and increase the firm’s profits; these initiatives <b>are</b> not designed <b>to</b> directly further {{the interests of the}} firm’s employees. [1] HR functions that try to simultaneously act as strategic business partners while maintaining their employee advocacy identity inevitably suffer from a lack of internal consistency, <b>causing</b> HR <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as a weak function by employees and managers alike. [2] In other words, efforts to balance SHRM and employee advocacy ultimately lead to the function failing in both of these roles. This identity crisis needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved in order to realize the value-adding potential of SHRM. In the following essay I will first discuss the historical context of the HR-employee advocacy problem, then describe the need to separate HR from employee advocacy in the modern work environment, and finally show the positive impacts of both employee self-advocacy and internally consistent SHRM...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the {{perception}} of target stimuli in rapid serial visual presentations, the process of temporal integration {{plays an important role}} when two targets are presented in direct succession (at Lag 1), <b>causing</b> them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as a singular episodic event. This has been associated with increased reversals of target order report and elevated task performance in classic paradigms. Yet, most current models of temporal attention do not incorporate a mechanism of temporal integration and it is currently an open question whether temporal integration is a factor in attentional processing: It might be an independent process, perhaps little more than a sensory sampling rate parameter, isolated to Lag 1, where it leaves the attentional dynamics otherwise unaffected. In the present study, these boundary conditions were tested. Temporal target integration was observed across sequences of three targets spanning an interval of 240 ms. Integration rates furthermore depended strongly on bottom-up attentional filtering, and to a lesser degree on top-down control. The results support the idea that temporal integration is an adaptive process that is part of, or at least interacts with, the attentional system. Implications for current models of temporal attention are discussed...|$|R

50|$|An early {{explanation}} of these illusions {{was that people}} judge the weight of an object from its appearance and then lift it with a pre-determined force. They expect a larger object <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heavier and therefore lift it with greater force: the larger object is then lifted more easily than the smaller one, <b>causing</b> it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as lighter. This hypothesis was disproved by an experiment in which two objects of the same mass, same cross section, but different height were placed on observers' supported hands, and produced a passive size-weight illusion. Recent studies have also shown that the lifting force quickly adapts to the true mass of the objects, but the size-weight illusion remains. The illusion therefore cannot {{be explained by the}} manner of lifting, and must <b>be</b> due <b>to</b> some perceptual rescaling based on prior expectations. The rescaling has been described as sub-optimal (anti-Bayesian), in that the central nervous system integrates prior expectations with current proprioceptive information in a way that emphasises the unexpected information rather than taking an average of all information. It has also recently been suggested that the illusion may not be anti-Bayesian, but may instead rely on more complex yet still optimal inference processes than traditionally suggested.|$|R
50|$|A groyne (groin in the United States) is a rigid {{hydraulic}} structure built from an ocean shore (in coastal engineering) {{or from a}} bank (in rivers) that interrupts water flow and limits the movement of sediment. It is usually made out of wood, concrete or stone. In the ocean, groynes create beaches or prevent them being washed away by longshore drift. In a river, groynes prevent erosion and ice-jamming, which in turn aids navigation. Ocean groynes run generally perpendicular to the shore, extending from the upper foreshore or beach into the water. All of a groyne may be under water, in which case it is a submerged groyne. The areas between groups of groynes are groyne fields. Groynes are generally placed in groups.
