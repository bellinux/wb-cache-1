5|$|During the Edo period Noh {{continued}} to be aristocratic art form supported by the shogun, the feudal lords (daimyōs), as well as wealthy and sophisticated commoners. While kabuki and joruri popular {{to the middle class}} focused on new and experimental entertainment, Noh strived to preserve its established high standards and historic authenticity and remained mostly unchanged throughout the era. To <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> performances given by great masters, every detail in movements and positions was reproduced by others, generally resulting in an increasingly slow, ceremonial tempo over time.|$|E
5|$|Games in {{the series}} have been praised as being among the best modern {{role-playing}} games. Reviewers mostly aimed their praise at particular elements of the games: visual design, and its resemblance to Studio Ghibli's previous work; characters and story, for their believability and complexity; the soundtrack, and Hisaishi's ability to <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> the game world; and the unique gameplay, particularly {{for its ability to}} blend formulas from other role-playing game franchises. The games also won awards from several gaming publications. In March 2014, Bandai Namco reported that the series had sold more than 1.7 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Like Trollope before him, Pope Hennessy took {{rooms at}} The Shannon Hotel, {{near the river}} and set about trying to <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> the town which had {{inspired}} Trollope's first novel, The Macdermots of Ballycloran. He {{proved to be a}} very popular figure in the town, evidenced {{by the fact that he}} was asked to adjudicate at a local beauty pageant and the horse fair. Pope Hennessy gives particular mention to the Corcoran family, the proprietors of The Shannon Hotel in the 1960s and 1970s, for their help in the production of his work. They sold the hotel in 1977.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} made {{as an attempt}} to <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo's live {{performances}} on film, and also as a means for both director Elfman to retire from music to work on film projects, and to serve as a transition between the group's former cabaret style and a new wave-based style. Amid negative reactions to content in the film that had been perceived as being offensive, the film was screened as a midnight movie, received positive notice, and developed a cult following. In 2004, the film was digitally restored and released on DVD, and in 2008, the film was colorized.|$|E
5|$|Wasting Light is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters. It was {{released}} on April 12, 2011 on RCA Records, and is the first album to feature rhythm guitarist Pat Smear since The Colour and the Shape (1997), making the band a five piece with the album. Wishing to <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> the group's earlier work and avoid the artificiality of digital recording, frontman Dave Grohl arranged for the band to record in his garage in Encino, California using only analog equipment. The sessions were supervised by producer Butch Vig, with whom Grohl had worked on Nirvana's Nevermind. Since the old equipment did not allow for many mistakes to be corrected in post-production, the band spent three weeks rehearsing the songs, and Vig had to relearn outdated editing techniques. The band went for a heavier and rawer sound to contrast with the musical experiments from their previous albums, {{and most of the}} lyrics were written as Grohl reflected upon his life and possible future. Guest musicians include Bob Mould, Krist Novoselic, Jessy Greene, Rami Jaffe and Fee Waybill.|$|E

25|$|Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak, of the University of Maryland, {{argues that}} {{one aspect of}} Kiarostami's {{cinematic}} style {{is that he is}} able to <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In several of his movies such as Where is the Friend's Home and The Wind Will Carry Us, classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between continuity and change.|$|E
25|$|Simple {{programs}} {{are capable of}} a remarkable range of behavior. Some have been proven to be universal computers. Others exhibit properties familiar from traditional science, such as thermodynamic behavior, continuum behavior, conserved quantities, percolation, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and others. They {{have been used as}} models of traffic, material fracture, crystal growth, biological growth, and various sociological, geological, and ecological phenomena. Another feature of simple programs is that, according to the book, making them more complicated seems to have little effect on their overall complexity. A New Kind of Science argues that this is evidence that simple {{programs are}} enough to <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> almost any complex system.|$|E

25|$|Poses {{can range}} in length from seconds to many hours. There is a drawing {{exercise}} where the model slowly but continuously moves, but the shortest is usually one minute. Short dynamic poses {{are used for}} gesture drawing exercises or warm-ups, with the model taking strenuous or precarious positions {{that could not be}} sustained for a longer pose—just long enough for the artist to quickly <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> it. Drawing sessions proceed though groups of 5, 10, 15, or 20 minute poses generally for a total of three hours. Active, gestural, or challenging standing poses are often scheduled {{at the beginning of a}} session when the models' energy level is highest. Specific exercises or lesson plans may require a particular type of pose, but more often the model is expected to do a series of poses with little direction. The more a model knows about the types of exercises used to teach art, the better they become at posing.|$|E
500|$|Rado and Ragni {{were unhappy}} with the film, feeling that Forman portrayed the hippies as [...] "oddballs" [...] and [...] "some sort of aberration" [...] without any {{connection}} to the peace movement, failing to <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> the original stage production. [...] They stated: [...] "Any resemblance between the 1979 film and the original Biltmore version, other {{than some of the}} songs, the names of the characters, and a common title, eludes us."

500|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who praised its honest and vulnerable nature and considered it her most personal solo album. However, some critics thought {{the album was}} too [...] "calculated" [...] and did not <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> a [...] "breakup album" [...] because it lacked a clear focus. Commercially, the album was moderately successful, becoming Stefani's first {{number one on the}} Billboard 200; in several other major music markets, it peaked within the top 40 on the charts. To promote the album further, Stefani embarked on her This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour with rapper Eve in North America and headlined the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre Final Shows with opening act Young the Giant.|$|E

[...] One reviewer of IGN gave the album 8 out of 10 stars, stating: [...] "It's an album that works expertly as a chill-out slice of background groove, yet it also doubles as a dance floor jolt of exuberance perfect for spinning at a small party", but also stated that the player, understandably, quickly forgets the music while playing. He concluded that the album is [...] "jazzaphonic electronic tripped out funkuphoria".|$|E
500|$|Early in the 1940s Douglas was {{approached}} by a publisher {{to contribute to the}} Rivers of America Series by writing about the Miami River. Unimpressed with it, she called the Miami River about [...] "an inch long", but in researching it became more interested in the Everglades and persuaded the publisher instead to allow her to write about them. She spent five years researching what little scientific knowledge was recorded about the ecology and history of the Everglades and South Florida. Douglas spent time with geologist Garald Parker, who discovered that all of South Florida's fresh water source was the Biscayne Aquifer, and it was filled by the Everglades. Parker confirmed the name of the book that has since become the nickname for the Everglades when Douglas, trying to <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> the Everglades, asked if she could safely call the fresh water flowing from Lake Okeechobee a river of grass.|$|E
500|$|The Bahia Palace, set in {{extensive}} gardens, {{was built}} in the late 19th century by the Grand Vizier of Marrakesh, Si Ahmed ben Musa (Bou-Ahmed). Bou Ahmed resided here with his four wives, 24 concubines and many children. With a name meaning [...] "brilliance", it was intended to be the greatest palace of its time, designed to <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> Islamic and Moroccan architectural styles. Bou-Ahmed paid special attention to the privacy of the palace in its construction and employed architectural features such as multiple doors which prevented passers-by from seeing into the interior. The palace took seven years to build, with hundreds of craftsmen from Fes working on its wood, carved stucco and zellij. The palace is set in a two-acre (8,000 m²) garden with rooms opening onto courtyards. The palace acquired {{a reputation as one of}} the finest in Morocco and was the envy of other wealthy citizens. Upon the death of Bou-Ahmed in 1900, the palace was raided by Sultan Abd al-Aziz.|$|E

[...] Hindustan Times gave it a rating of 3.5 out of 5, praising its [...] "youthful fervour" [...] and adding that [...] "the album manages to <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> three different periods on which the film is premised." [...] The Times of India gave it 3 out of 5, also commenting on its fresh and youthful feel, and calling it [...] "another hit album" [...] despite the fact that [...] "it falls short in some songs". Koimoi gave the [...] "good album" [...] 3 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "as a package it has enough ingredients in it that would ensure that the songs do catch your attention when they are played on screen." [...] BBC identified the album as [...] "A crowd pleaser featuring the cream of the industry’s playback singers." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{factor in}} the {{original}} development of set pieces was the design of vast and seamless environments. They were meant to enable scenarios such as the player character being shot at from a great distance, or a battle which would change scenes between the outside and inside of a building. This corroborated Nomura's intended action-oriented system with more intuitive game controls. He instructed his team to study third-person shooters for reference, [...] "not in simplistic terms, like controls or mechanics, but {{in the way they}} create tension and mood and incorporate the action within that". This carried over into XV, with the stated aim being to distance the game structurally from XIII and its sequels, which featured divided zones rather than a large seamless world. The original inspiration behind this approach was the world design of , with later inspirations being modern Western triple-A open world titles. The environments are divided into three different segments, with separate teams working on each: the world map, locations in the game world, and dungeons. The dungeons were designed to be beautiful, frightening, and memorable. Specific pieces of concept art were created to represent different regions and aesthetic concepts: a single building design was used to <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> Altissia's Venice-inspired atmosphere, while older car designs when compared to the party's vehicle Regalia reflected the lack of human advancement outside Lucis.|$|E
500|$|Paramount Pictures {{acquired}} the film rights for Tomb Raider in 1998, which was released as [...] in 2001. Producer Lloyd Levin {{stated that the}} film makers tried to <b>capture</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> the video game elements rather than duplicate them. Acknowledging the character's [...] "huge fan base" [...] and recognisable appearance, director Simon West sought an actress with acting ability {{as well as physical}} attributes similar to Croft. Paramount also received input from developer Core Design on casting. Rumoured actresses included Pamela Anderson, Demi Moore, Jeri Ryan and Carla Pivonski. Academy Award-winning actress Angelina Jolie was eventually cast to play Lara Croft. She had not been a fan of the character, but considered the role as a [...] "big responsibility", citing anxiety about fans' high expectations. Producer Lawrence Gordon felt she was a perfect fit for the role. Jolie braided her hair and used minimal padding to increase her bust a cup size to 36D for the role. She felt that Croft's video game proportions were unrealistic, and wanted to avoid showing such proportions to young girls. Jolie trained rigorously for the action scenes required for the role, occasionally sustaining injuries. Her training focused on practising the physical skills necessary to perform the film's stunts. The difficulty of the training and injuries discouraged her, but she continued working through production. Jolie also encountered difficulties when working the guns, bungee jumping, and manoeuvring with the braid. West had not anticipated that Jolie would do her own stunts, and was impressed, as was stunt coordinator Simon Crane, by the effort she put into them.|$|E
