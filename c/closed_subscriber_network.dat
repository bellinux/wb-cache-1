40|$|The Korean {{government}} has established 'The Basic BcN (Broadband convergence Network) Plan II', and organized a consortium for its full‐scale implementation {{as part of}} its attempt to create the ubiquitous society through a mixed and converged service based on the integrated network. The BcN, which interconnects various <b>subscriber</b> <b>networks</b> having such characteristics as PSTN and WCDMA, could potentially affect other <b>subscriber</b> <b>networks</b> if infringement incidents occur in the specific <b>subscriber</b> <b>network.</b> Therefore, the need to secure safety from the BcN network setup stage has emerged as an important issue. Accordingly, this paper analyzes the characteristics of the pilot project that are being executed to establish the BcN in Korea, and the infrastructure and interworking scenario with a focus on PSTN and WCDMA, which is the representative interworking scenario, so that security measures against potential infringement incidents can be proposed...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{enormous}} increase of cellular telecommunication systems, mobile data also needs faster access. The Femtocell is the right answer to fulfill the cellular telecommunication system requirements nowadays. The Femtocell is used to cover the areas with a low signal from the Macrocell and also the areas that need a bigger data rate. When using the Femtocell it can produces sometimes interference signals to the Macrocell in uplink {{as well as in}} downlink communication because not all of the users can be connected to the Femtocell in a <b>Closed</b> <b>Subscriber</b> Group Femtocell system. This thesis analyses and calculates how the <b>Closed</b> <b>Subscriber</b> Group Femtocell affects the Macrocell in both ways - in uplink to the Macrocell and also in downlink to the Macrocell User Equipment for the maximum power of the Femtocell with 21 dBm. Power Interferences are observed and compared with the real power received in the same coverage area. The current study was calculated {{with the help of the}} application ‘Matlab’. The result from the analysis of the <b>Closed</b> <b>Subscriber</b> Group Femtocell is that the Macrocell is affected in both ways - uplink and also downlink. The parameter for uplink interferences is shown by the Noise Rise. The coverage result for accepted Noise Rise point (6 dB) for minimum threshold for the communication happens is 39 meters. The parameter for downlink interferences is shown by Ec/N 0, the coverage result for accepted Ec/N 0 point (? 18 dB) for the minimum threshold for the communication happens is 267 meters. </p...|$|R

3000|$|In {{the first}} phase of {{femtocell}} deployment, <b>closed</b> <b>subscriber</b> group (CSG) configurations (see [3]) are expected to be widely used due to security, billing, and contractual concerns. In a CSG configuration, the femto base station (FBS) only serves users who are a member of a particular CSG. We refer to this configuration when using the term [...] "closed femtocell", and it is emphasized that the CSG prevents any handover attempts from users that are not included in the CSG. For this reason, it is important to develop methods for alleviating cochannel interference in private femtocells.|$|R

This article relaxes this assumption and allows networks to charge different prices for calls terminating on the <b>subscriber's</b> <b>network</b> and those terminating on a rivals network. This creates a price differential between services that are identical for the consumer and generates network externalities despite network interconnection. We show that in both the mature and entry phases of the industry, the nature of competition is substantially affected by such price discrimination. ...|$|R
