50|$|The {{city was}} autonomous; it issued its own coins, one {{displaying}} {{the images of}} a <b>Cretan</b> <b>wild</b> <b>goat</b> and a bee named Tarra. Another coin depicted a dolphin and an eight-ray star. Elyros, Lissos, Tarra, and Yrtakina had an established monetary union when they joined the Cretan League in the 3rd century BC. Yrtakina {{was one of the}} Cretan cities that allied with Eumenes B’.|$|E
50|$|The {{natural park}} of Samariá Gorge, a major tourist {{attraction}} and {{a refuge for}} the rare <b>Cretan</b> <b>wild</b> <b>goat</b> or kri-kri, is in the South of the regional unit. The White Mountains or Lefka Ori, through which the Samaria, Aradena, Imbros and other gorges run, are the limestone peaks topped by snow until May that occupy much of Chania regional unit. They contain more than 40 peaks over 2,000 meters high. The highest peak {{in this area is}} Pachnes, at 2,453 meters above sea level.|$|E
50|$|Although it {{was just}} a town, Tarra minted its own coins. The coins have the head of a <b>Cretan</b> <b>wild</b> <b>goat,</b> an arrow, and a bee. Tarra had {{monetary}} union with Elyros, Yrtakina, and Lissos. The coins belong to the 3rd and 2nd century BC, when Tarra {{became a member of the}} Republic of Cretans. The city had established a colony of the same name in the Caucasus. It is also believed that Tarra of south Italy was another colony of the city. It probably founded Lampa, also found on Crete, as well.|$|E
50|$|Accessible only by {{boat from}} Sfakiá is Loutro, a small seaside village with some archaeological ruins, a few houses, small hotels and tavernas. Loutro is car-free; cars must be parked in Hóra Sfakíon or Paleohóra. In {{the north of}} Sfakiá is the fertile plain of Askyfou. The Sfakía region is crossed by many gorges, among which is the famous Samaria Gorge. All these gorges run {{from north to south}} and all end in the sea. Many of them can be walked, several even by inexperienced walkers. The region is {{inhabited}} by rare animals, like vultures and eagles, and the kri-kri (or agrimi), the <b>wild</b> <b>Cretan</b> <b>goat.</b> The coast of Sfakiá is on the Libyan Sea, which is inhabited by a diminishing fish population, but occasionally dolphins, and even whales may be seen.|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} {{seasonal}} food availability and quality for <b>Cretan</b> <b>wild</b> <b>goat</b> or agrimi Capra aegagrus cretica introduced on Atalandi Island, Greece, was conducted during 1988 - 89. The {{major portion of}} available forage consisted of Olea europaea var. sylvestris, Pistacia lentiscus and Cistus ssp. The first two species are the main food resources in late summer and early autumn, the critical period for agrimi nutrition, and the only species with crude protein (CP) content exceeding maintenance requirements of agrimi. Grasses contained {{the highest level of}} neutral detergent fibre (NDF) among all plant categories in all seasons. Herbaceous species had the lowest level of lignin and shrubs the highest. In vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) of herbaceous species was > 50 % only in spring. During summer only Olea europaea produced sufficient forage with digestibility c. 50 %. Future management must be directed toward maintaining a balance between vegetation productivity and grazing pressure. Maintaining the agrimi population at grazing capacity would allow an increase of productivity of palatable species. The seeding of palatable native herbs would provide nutritious feed for the agrimi and reduce the grazing impact. Continuous monitoring of the agrimi population, vegetation and soil trends is considered indispensable...|$|E

50|$|In Iran, its {{principal}} prey is ungulates such as <b>wild</b> <b>goat,</b> <b>wild</b> sheep, wild boar, roe deer and Goitered gazelle.

In both cases, the overlapping species do not usually interbreed in the wild, but in captivity, all Capra species can interbreed, producing fertile offspring.|$|R
