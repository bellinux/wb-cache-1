40|$|A summary {{is given}} of the {{background}} and present status of pure-planing theory. Data for models having sharp chines have been obtained for a rectangular flat plate and two V-bottom surfaces having constant angles of dead rise of 20 degrees and 40 degrees and also for rectangular-flat-plate surfaces having very slightly rounded chines. The theory presented in NACA Technical Note 3233 for a rectangular flat plate is revised and extended to include triangular flat plates planing with base forward and V-shaped prismatic surfaces having a constant angle of dead rise, horizontal <b>chine</b> <b>flare,</b> or vertical chine strips. The agreement between the results calculated by the proposed theory and the experimental data is satisfactory for engineering calculations of lift and center-of-pressure location...|$|E
40|$|A summary {{is given}} of the {{background}} and present status of the pure-planing theory for rectangular flat plates and V-bottom surfaces. The equations reviewed are compared with experiment. In order to extend the range of available planing data, the principal planing characteristics for models hsving sharp chines have been obtained for a rectangular flat and two V-bottom surfaces having constant angles of dead rise of 200 and 400 • Planing data were also obtained for flat-plate surfaces with very slightly rounded chines for which decreased lift and drag coefficients are obtained. A revision of the theory presented in NACA Technical Note 3233 is presented for the rectangular flat plate. The revised theory bases the aerodynamic suction effects on the total lift rather than solely on the linear component. Also a crossflow drag coefficient which is dependent on t~e shape of the chines was found from experiment to be constant for a given immersed cross section; however, for surfaces, such as those having horizonta l <b>chine</b> <b>flare</b> or vertical chine strips, the crossflo...|$|E
40|$|Bureau of Aeronautics Design Specifications SS-IC- 2 {{for water}} loads in {{sheltered}} water are compared with experimental water loads obtained during a full [...] scale landing investigation. This investigation {{was conducted with}} a JRS- 1 flying boat which has a 20 degrees dead-rise V-bottom with a partial <b>chine</b> <b>flare.</b> The range of landing conditions included airspeeds between 88 and 126 feet per second, sinking speeds between 1. 6 and 9. 1 feet per second, flight angles less than 6 degrees, and trims between 2 degrees and 12 degrees. Landings were moderate and were made in calm water. Measurements were obtained of maximum over-all loads, maximum pitching moments, and pressure distributions. Maximum experimental loads include over-all load factors of 2 g, moments of 128, 000 pound-feet, and maximum local pressures greater than 40 pounds per square inch. Experimental over-all loads are approximately one-half the design values, while local pressures are of the same order as or larger than pressures calculated from specifications for plating, stringer, floor, and frame design. The value of this comparison is limited, to some extent, by the moderate conditions of the test and by the necessary simplifying assumptions used in comparing the specifications with the experimental loads...|$|E
50|$|Hull {{form for}} the vessel was {{developed}} based on a semi displacement hard <b>chine</b> form, <b>flared</b> forward in combination of built in spray rail to further improve the vessel's performance and planing at high speeds. The hull was initially developed and designed by Tenix using hydrostatics software Maxsurf and later sent to the Maritime Research Institute (MARIN) for review, which confirmed the predicted performance of the vessel. Seakeeping features includes sustained speeds of 12 knots in Sea State 4. Hull is of all-welded construction with grade 250 steel with aluminum superstructure including flight deck. Stern door constructed of aluminum alloy to reduce weight. Main propulsion consists of two medium speed Caterpillar 3612, producing 4,060 bkW at 1,000 rpm mounted with a flexible coupling connecting the flywheel to a clutchable Reintjes LAF 3445 reduction gearbox, gearbox ratio 2.515:1. The gearbox is hard mounted with a horizontally offset output driving a shaft line connected to acbLips four-bladed (Hub 4D710D) controllable-pitch propeller. Each propulsion train and ancillary systems are capable of operating independently. Port reduction gearbox provides a power take-off connection for the fire monitor pump which are used alongside firefighting capability. Main engines and auxiliaries are fueled by 109,762 liters of diesel, sufficient for an operational range of 1,000 nm at speeds of 24 knots and 2,000 nm at speeds of 15 knots, both with 10% remaining fuel. Electrical power is supplied by two Caterpillar 3406 generators sets each provides 260 ekW located in the forward area of the engine room. The design allows for the complete electric power demand to be supplied with only one generator. Emergency Caterpillar 3306 harbor generator located at main deck aft provides 105 ekW in case of main generator failure. The emergency set is air cooled and configured for automatic startup on loss of the ships main power. Main engine room is protected with a carbon dioxide extinguishing system. Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) is provided for protection of the flight deck via a mixed foam tank and proportioners. Electronics includes Furuno GPS with Furuno ARPA 26 plotter, Furuno X and S band radars, Furuno depth sounder, Furuno 8000 GMDSS, Furuno Inmarsat B and C Satcom, Furuno FAX 2084 weatherfax, Tokimec 110GS gyrocompass and Tokimec PR 2213 autopilot. Flight deck located on the after end of the bridge deck can support a helicopter for airborne SAR or emergency evacuation, with a maximum weight of 4,672 kg (10,728 lb). Weapons hardpoints located at the bow can mount heavier caliber guns, which was specified by the PCG.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Langley impact basin of the water loads on a half scale model of the XJL- 1 hull whose forebody has a vee bottom with exaggerated <b>chine</b> <b>flare.</b> The impact loads, moments, and pressures were determined {{for a range of}} landing conditions. A normal full-scale landing speed of 86 miles per hour was represented with effective flight paths ranging from 0. 6 deg to 11. 6 deg. Landings were made with both fixed trim and free-to-trim mounting of the float over a trim range of - 15 deg to 12 deg into smooth water and into waves having equivalent full-scale length. of 120 feet and heights ranging from 1 to 4 feet. All data and results presented in this report are given in terms of equivalent full-scale values. Summary tables and illustrative plots are used in presenting the material. The following maximum values of load and pressure are those which are apropos for effective flight paths less than 6. 5 deg which was the maximum value obtained in tests with the XJL- 1 hull model representing full-scale landings with vertical velocity of 4. 5 feet per second into 4 -foot waves. The maximum local pressure on the flat portion of the bottom is 130 pounds per square inch which was measured on a 2 -inch-diameter circular area near the step. The maximum local pressure obtained in the curved area near the chines is 200 pounds per square inch. This pressure was also measured near the step...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} extend the range of {{available}} planing-surface data, the hydrodynamic characteristics have been obtained for a planing surface having a basic angle of dead rise of 20 ° at the keel and horizontal <b>chine</b> <b>flare.</b> This surface is representative of those used on present-day flying boats. The wetted lengths, resistances, center-of-pressuye locations, and drafts were determined at speed coefficients (Froude numbers) ranging from approximately 3. 0 to 25. 0, with {{the bulk of the}} data obtained at Froude numbers in excess of 7. 0. Beam loadings were varied from 0. 85 to 87. 33. Keel-wetted-length-hem ratios were extended to 7. 0 in all cases where excessive loads and spray conditions were not encountered. The data obtained indicate that, during high-speed steady-state & planing, the planing characteristics are independent of speed and load for a given trim and depend,only on lift coefficient. The difference between the chine wetted length and keel wetted length is constant for a given trim angle and the vsriation of this difference with trim is shown to b. ein reasonable agreement with theory. The ratio of center-of-pressure location forward of the step to the mean wetted length, for practical applications, can be considered a constant equal to 0. 67 up to 180 of trim. A slight decrease in this ratio occurs wi$h further increase in trim angle. The draft data indicate a pile-up of water at the keel during. steady-state planing. Although negligible at low trims, this pile-up was significant at trims of 12 ° and higher. The drag data show that friction drag at trims of 18 ° and higher is negligible and that the resistances for those trims may be assumed ”equalto the load times the tangent of the trim angle...|$|E
