40|$|Given the {{pervasive}} silence that surrounds sexuality in elementary schools,Halloween provides {{a rare opportunity}} to explore its tangible manifestations. Schools sanction overt displays of sexuality and transgressions of certain school norms on this day. A time of celebration, it is perceived as a festive event for children, innocent and fun. Yet, because Halloween is the one school day where sexuality is on display, sexuality literally becomes a spectacle. Halloween serves as a magnifying glass to examine the operation of sexuality in the institution of elementary schools, illuminating a nexus of attendant relationships—social, economic, political, and cultural. These relationships lie buried beneath the veneer of fun and play that is popularly imagined as integral to the holiday. Drawing from ethnographic data collected over the 2010 - 2011 school year, I explore how processes of citizen creation through schooling are abetted by the U. <b>S.</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>market,</b> which strategically targets children, and girls in particular. This paper examines the ways in which elementary school Halloween celebrations bring to light the significance of sexuality in a culture that creates and exploits children’s desires...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an alternative theory of price adjustment resting on consumer loss aversion {{in the price}} dimension. In line with prospect theory the perceived losses from price increases are weighted stronger in the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> utility function than the perceived gains resulting from price decreases of equal magnitude. Prices are evaluated relative to a certain reference price which is endogenous, sluggish and depends to the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> recent rational price expectations. Two key modeling implications arise: First, demand responses are more elastic for price increases than for price decreases and thus firms face a downward-sloping demand curve that is kinked at the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> reference price. Second, changes in the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> recent rational price expectations and hence in the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> reference price can alter demand through {{what we call the}} reference-price-updating effect. We incorporate this into an otherwise standard dynamic neoclassical model of monopolistic competition and analyze price and quantity reactions to various demand shocks. We find that although firms may change their prices flexibly, {{depending on the size of}} the shock the prices adjust more or less pronounced than in the standard monopoly model and that prices can even be rigid. Additionally, we find that the price adjustment is asymmetric with respect to shock size and sign and the current state of the business cycle, i. e. pricing is state-dependent...|$|R

However, there is strong evidence that foreign investors follow their past behavior {{into and out of}} the U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> over adjacent months. Foreigners' buy-side behavior of buying U.

Evidence shows that independent of whether the U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> is up or down, foreign investors continue to increase their holdings of U.

40|$|The {{landmark}} Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 (2 ̆ 2 Dodd-Frank 2 ̆ 2) {{transforms the}} regulation of consumer credit in the United States. Many of its changes have been high-profile, attracting considerable media and scholarly attention, most notably {{the establishment of the}} Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (2 ̆ 2 CFPB 2 ̆ 2). Even specific consumer reforms, such as a so-called 2 ̆ 2 plain vanilla 2 ̆ 2 proposal, drew hot debate and lobbying firepower. But when the dust settled, one profoundly transformative innovation that did not garner the same outrage as plain vanilla or the CFPB did get into the law: imposing upon lenders a duty to assure a borrower 2 ̆ 7 s ability to repay. Ensuring a borrower 2 ̆ 7 s ability to repay is not an entirely unprecedented legal concept, to be sure, but its wholesale embrace by the Dodd-Frank represents a sea change in U. <b>S.</b> <b>consumer</b> credit <b>market</b> regulation. This Article does three things regarding the new duty to assess a consumer 2 ̆ 7 s ability to repay mortgage loans. First, it traces the multifaceted pedigree of this requirement by looking at fledgling strands in U. <b>S.</b> <b>consumer</b> law, as well as other areas such as securities law; it also considers its more robust embrace in foreign systems. Second, it offers conjecture regarding how this broadly stated principle might be put into practice by the federal regulators.

S. regional wine shipments, or wine miles, to U. <b>S.</b> <b>markets.</b> To examine this issue we calibrate a spatial equilibrium model of the U. S. wine industry. The model accounts for (i) consumer preferences for variety, (ii) monopolistic-competition/increasing-returns in the production of differentiated wine products, and (iii) transportation costs. Wine production areas are grouped into nine U. S. and seven world producing regions. U. <b>S.</b> <b>markets</b> are grouped into the 50 States plus the District of Columbia. Results indicate that U. <b>S.</b> <b>consumers</b> are willing to pay substantial transportation costs in order to consume a wide variety of wines from premier U. S. and world wine growing regions. As increasing energy costs drive up the price of freight services, wine mile impacts are limited by the degree of regional product differentiation in U. S. and world producing regions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which financial returns on market indices exhibit mean and volatility asymmetries, as a response to past information from both the U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> and the local market itself. In particular, we wish to assess the asymmetric effect of a combination of local and U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> news on volatility. To the best of the authors knowledge, this joint effect has not been considered previously. We propose a double threshold non-linear heteroscedastic model, combined with a GJR-GARCH effect in the conditional volatility equation, to capture jointly both mean and volatility asymmetric behaviours and the interactive effect of U. <b>S.</b> and local <b>market</b> news. In an application to five major international market indices, clear evidence of threshold non-linearity is discovered, supporting the hypothesis of an uneven mean-reverting pattern and volatility asymmetry, both in reaction to U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> news and news from the local market itself. Significant, but somewhat different, interactive effects between local and U. S. news are observed in all markets. An asymmetric pattern in the exogenous relationship between the local market and the U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> is also found. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
