40|$|With {{synchrotron}} small/wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), we {{revealed that}} post-harvest hydration at ambient conditions can further alter the starch crystalline structure. The hydration process induced the alignment of starch helices into crystalline lamellae, {{irrespective of the}} starch type (A- or B-). In this process, non-crystalline helices were probably packed with water molecules to form new <b>crystal</b> <b>units,</b> thereby enhancing the overall concentration of starch crystallinity. In particular, {{a fraction of the}} monoclinic <b>crystal</b> <b>units</b> of the A-type starches encapsulated water molecules during hydration, leading to the outward movement of starch helices. Such movement resulted in the transformation of monoclinic units into hexagonal units, which was associated with the B-type crystallites. Hence, the hydration under ambient conditions could enhance the B-polymorphic features for both A-type and B-type starches.
