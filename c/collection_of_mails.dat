In the early 1940s big time commercial firms (companies) such as U.A.C and in later years John Holt, U.T.C, C.F.A.O, established factories in the city. The Post and Telegraph now (NIPOST) established a station in this city in 1947/48 causing posting and <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>mails</b> at the District Officer's office at Ayoba to cease. In 1958, pipe-borne water facility was provided making Ado-Ekiti the first town in present Ondo and Ekiti States to enjoy the facility. Two years later, ECN (now NEPA) extended electricity to the city. These facilities enhanced/increased commercial activities and brought immense socio-economic benefit and improved standard of life to the people. From the 1950s, commercial banks, at first the National Bank, the Union Bank, and in the 1960s and 1970s Co-operative Bank and United Bank for West Africa, opened their branch offices in Ado-Ekiti.|$|E

25|$|The initiative, called Postal Transformation, {{has been}} rolled {{out across the}} country from 2010-2017. This {{transformation}} saw {{a fundamental change in}} the work duties of letter carriers. Previously, the delivery of parcels, clearance and transfers to retail postal outlets and <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> from street letter boxes was carried out by the separate position <b>of</b> a <b>mail</b> service courier, while letter carriers delivered the mail through walking routes, utilizing public transit and taxis to travel to their work locations. Today, letter carrier routes are motorized and they are responsible for delivering parcels, mail, clearing and transfers at retail postal outlets, and <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> from street letter boxes. The additional duties have led to increased overtime, work stress, and injuries to employees who are facing greater fatigue and delivering mail in the dark; with many complaining that regular routes can no longer be completed in 8 hours, resulting in forced overtime and undelivered mail.|$|R

However, with the resumption of government ownership in 1900 a concerted effort was made to give the railway {{a more active role in}} the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b> A few stations were stops at major plantations and although the volume <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> from these locations was very small, timely pick-up of this correspondence, much of it commercial, was deemed vital to the well being of the economy.|$|R

40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{three techniques}} to automatically cluster a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> documents: Word-Intersection with GQF, Word-Intersection with hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and TreeClustering. The Word-Intersection algorithms have been previously {{described in the}} literature while the TreeClustering technique is novel to this work. The TreeCluster algorithm idea comes from rule induction techniques and is used to generate a shallow tree of clusters that a user can browse. This algorithm is also O(n) when used with a fixed tree depth, as opposed to O(n) as the other two algorithms. Experimental results on a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mail</b> and Web documents indicate that the agglomerative clustering algorithm performed the best, but also the slowest. The GQF algorithm performed well on the Mail domain, but performed poorly on the Web domain without tuning to its heuristic. The TreeCluster algorithm performed reasonably well on both domains, and was also the fastest algorithm out of the three algorithms tested...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a hierarchical topic model. We {{assume that there}} are various levels of specificity in a document collection. For example, a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>mailing</b> list posts can be organized according to sentence, paragraph, post and thread. We {{describe a}} model that encourages the largest changes in topics to occur {{at the highest levels}} of the hierarchy (e. g. post, thread). 1 The Basic Model We assume that there is hierarchical structure to the document collection. We assume that there are a set of fundamental units which cannot be broken down any further, such as sentences. We represent each sentence as a bag-of-words, disgarding sequence information and simply storing its vector of word counts. We form the matrix Y out of the sentence word count vectors (one vector per row). We assume that each word count vector (row of Y) is generated by a multinomial model. We store the multinomial natural parameters in another matrix, X; each row of X contains the natural parameters for the corresponding row of Y. X and Y are the same size. Note that entries of X are real values; entries of Y are non-negative integers. Let Xij (Yij) index the i th row, j th column entry of X (Y).

For example, a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>mailing</b> list posts might be organized according to sentence, paragraph, post and thread. We {{describe a}} model that captures the structure at each level of the hierarchy. We use a trace norm penalty on a matrix composed of natural parameters for the multinomial model. 1 The Basic Model We consider a probabilitistic model of text. We assume that a set of documents is generated in two stages. First, a set of document models are generated according to a prior model. Then, words for each document are generated according to that document’s model. We assume that a document’s term frequencies are generated independently of other documents’, when conditioning on the document’s model. We use a trace norm to penalize document models’ divergence from the prior model, effectively placing a Gaussian prior on the singular vectors of the matrix composed of stacked document model parameter vectors. We use {{the rest of this}} section to describe the model in detail. Let φ be the multinomial natural parameter vector for the “prior ” model; φ represents somewhat of a “center ” from which the individual document models emanate. Each document has its own multinomial model, with a natural parameter vector, θi. We define the prior on the document models as a characterization of where ⎡ the document ⎤ models are located with respect to the prior θ 1 − φ ⎢ θ 2 ⎢ − φ ⎥ model. Let Θ = ⎢ ⎥ be that matrix of stacked difference vectors, one θn − φ vector per row. Then, the prior distribution on document models is P(θ 1, [...] ., θn; φ) ∝ exp (−λ �Θ � tr). (1) The trace norm calculates the sum of singular values of the matrix, so this prior I) on a basis for is effectively a Gaussian prior (with mean φ and variance 1 λ 1 Θ.

This is based on the features which capture maximum variance of information we have clustered. Presence information is a growing tool towards more efficient communication and providing new services and features within a business setting and much more.
