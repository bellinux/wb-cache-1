5|$|After the Second World War, radar made {{camouflage}} {{generally less}} effective, though coastal boats are sometimes painted like land vehicles. Aircraft camouflage too <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as less important because of radar, and aircraft of different air forces, {{such as the}} Royal Air Force's Lightning, were often uncamouflaged.|$|E
5|$|Overall Set {{was viewed}} with ambivalence, until {{during the first}} {{millennium}} BCE he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as a totally malevolent deity. This transformation was prompted more by his association with foreign lands than by the Osiris myth. Nevertheless, in these late times, the widespread temple rituals involving the ceremonial annihilation of Set were often connected with the myth.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{planners}} began formulating {{their plans}} for the future direction of the fighting in the wider Pacific with a focus upon retaking the Philippines and the eventual capture of the Japanese Home Islands. The lynchpin to Japanese strength in the region was their main base at Rabaul. The reduction of this base <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as a key tenet of success in the SWPA for the Allies and was formalised into Operation Cartwheel.|$|E

5|$|Chrysippus was a {{prolific}} writer. He {{is said to}} rarely have gone without writing 500 lines a day and he composed more than 705 works. His desire to be comprehensive meant {{that he would take}} both sides of an argument and his opponents accused him of filling his books with the quotations of others. He was considered diffuse and obscure in his utterances and careless in his style, but his abilities were highly regarded, and he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as a preeminent authority for the school.|$|E
5|$|The early 1940s was of {{particular}} importance in American art as American scene painting (Regionalism) <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as an inadequate mode of artistic expression in a tumultuous time. In 1942, Peggy Guggenheim, who had fled Europe with her husband, Surrealist artist Max Ernst, opened her gallery Art of This Century, showing European and promising American avant-garde artists. Jackson Pollock had his first one-man show there in 1943 and, in 1945, Guggenheim showed Mark Rothko.|$|E
5|$|The term Żydokomuna {{originated}} {{in connection with}} the Russian Bolshevik Revolution and targeted Jewish communists during the Polish-Soviet War. The emergence of the Soviet state was seen by many Poles as Russian imperialism in a new guise. The visibility of Jews in both the Soviet leadership and in the Polish Communist Party further heightened such fears. In some circles, Żydokomuna <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as a prominent antisemitic stereotype expressing political paranoia.|$|E

5|$|When Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, it <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as {{unlikely}} {{that there would}} be any attempted landing as long as that conflict was undecided — from the British point of view at the time, the matter hung in the balance. In July 1941, construction of field fortifications was greatly reduced and concentration given to the possibility of a raid in force rather than a full-scale invasion.|$|E
5|$|Film noirs {{tend to have}} unusually {{convoluted}} story lines, frequently involving flashbacks {{and other}} editing techniques that disrupt and sometimes obscure the narrative sequence. Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover narration, sometimes used as a structuring device, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as a noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person narration (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person narration is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style. Neo-noirs as varied as The Element of Crime (surrealist), After Dark, My Sweet (retro), and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers began finding {{other objects}} {{at least as}} far away as Pluto, now known as Kuiper Belt objects, or KBOs. Many of these shared some of Pluto's key orbital {{characteristics}} and are now called plutinos. Pluto <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as the largest member of a new class of objects, and some astronomers stopped referring to Pluto as a planet. Pluto's eccentric and inclined orbit, while very unusual for a planet in the Solar System, fits in well with the other KBOs. New York City's newly renovated Hayden Planetarium did not include Pluto in its exhibit of the planets when it reopened as the Rose Center for Earth and Space in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Indonesia kept East Timor {{shut off}} from the rest of the world, except for a few years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{claiming}} that the vast majority of East Timorese supported integration. This position was followed closely by the Indonesian media such that an East Timorese acceptance of their integration with Indonesia was taken for granted by, and was a non-issue for, the majority of Indonesians. East Timor <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as a training ground for the officer corps in tactics of suppression for Aceh and Papua, and was pivotal in ensuring military sector dominance of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|On {{a typical}} weekday, a {{combined}} total of 50,000 people {{worked in the}} North and South Towers, with another 200,000 passing through as visitors. The complex was so large that it had its own zip code: 10048. The Windows on the World restaurant, located {{on top of the}} North Tower, reported revenues of $37 million in 2000, making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the United States. The Twin Towers became known worldwide, appearing in movies, television shows, postcards, and other merchandise. The towers <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as a New York City icon, much like the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
5|$|The first philosopher {{to outline}} these themes was Antisthenes, {{who had been}} a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BC. He was {{followed}} by Diogenes, who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens. Diogenes took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by Crates of Thebes, who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the empire. It finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although similar ascetic and rhetorical ideas appear in early Christianity.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{distance}} between legislation and its enforcement. The governmental attacks on recusancy were mostly upon the gentry. Few recusants were actually fined; the fines that were imposed were often at reduced rates; the persecution eased; priests came to recognise {{that they should}} not refuse communion to occasional conformists. The persecutions did not extinguish the faith, but they tested it sorely. The huge number of Roman Catholics in East Anglia and the North in the 1560s disappeared into the general population in part because recusant priests largely served the great Roman Catholic houses, which alone could hide them. Without the Mass and pastoral care, yeomen, artisans and husbandmen fell into conformism. Roman Catholicism, supported by foreign or expatriate priests, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as treasonous.|$|E
5|$|From 1921 to 1927, Murray led archaeological {{excavations}} on Malta, {{assisted by}} Edith Guest and Gertrude Caton Thompson. She excavated the Bronze Age megalithic monuments of Santa Sofia, Santa Maria tal-Bakkari, Għar Dalam, and Borġ in-Nadur, {{all of which}} were threatened by {{the construction of a new}} aerodrome. In this she was funded by the Percy Sladen Memorial Fund. Her resulting three-volume excavation report <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as an important publication within the field of Maltese archaeology. During the excavations, she had taken an interest in the island's folklore, resulting in the 1932 publication of her book Maltese Folktales, much of which was a translation of earlier stories collected by Father Magri and her friend Liza Galea. In 1932 Murray returned to Malta to aid in the cataloguing of the Bronze Age pottery collection held in Malta Museum, resulting in another publication, Corpus of the Bronze Age Pottery of Malta.|$|E
5|$|Howe's {{impatience with}} the {{necessity}} for parliamentary debate of his proposals won him few friends, and he was often accused of dictatorial conduct by the Opposition. As the Liberal government entered its third decade, it and Howe <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as arrogant. The Government's attempt to impose closure in the 1956 Pipeline Debate led to major controversy in the House of Commons. In the 1957 election, Howe's actions and policies were made an issue by Opposition leader John Diefenbaker. Howe faced a serious challenge in his riding, but was expected to make speeches elsewhere as a major Liberal leader. Howe lost his seat in the election, and Diefenbaker became Prime Minister, ending almost 22years of Liberal rule. Howe returned to the private sector, accepting a number of corporate directorships. The former minister died suddenly {{of a heart attack}} in December 1960.|$|E

5|$|In this {{situation}} one Ivaylo, {{a native of}} north-eastern Bulgaria, most likely the area near Provadia, began to incite the population to revolt. He was called by the contemporary Byzantine chroniclers by the name Bardokva (lettuce) or Lakhanas (vegetable) and his real name is known only from a note, attached to the Svarlig gospel. The Byzantine historian George Pachymeres stated {{that he was a}} swineherd who took care of pigs for money. However, the historian John Fine notes that pigs were a major livestock product at the time and the possessor of a large herd could {{have been part of the}} elite of the local community. Ivaylo claimed that he had visions from God to lead the people and that he was in contact with heaven and the saints. In fact, his mysticism was deliberately used to swiftly gain support and followers among the religious villagers. He <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> by many Bulgarians as a God-given saviour.|$|E
5|$|Isabeau was {{dismissed}} by historians as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now {{see her as}} taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of her period, forced to take responsibility {{as a direct result}} of Charles' illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with Orléans. Gibbons writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, and she <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as one of the great villains of history. Gibbons goes on to say that even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to be portrayed as good or evil.|$|E
5|$|The {{air raids}} on Singapore raised {{the morale of}} the island's {{civilian}} population. They were seen as heralding Singapore's liberation from Japan's oppressive rule, though civilians were generally careful to hide this belief from Japanese occupation personnel. The B-29s were widely believed to be invulnerable, and civilians were cheered by their apparent ability to attack the Japanese at will. In an attempt to counter this view, the occupation authorities exhibited wreckage from downed B-29s and surviving crew members as well as film footage of a Superfortress being shot down. This propaganda campaign was not successful. The Japanese also failed in their attempts to rouse Singapore's Muslim population against the raids by highlighting damage suffered by a mosque on 11January and 24February, the latter a raid which coincided with the celebration of Muhammad's birthday. Another factor which contributed to public support for the raids was that the policy of targeting military installations meant that {{only a limited number of}} civilians became casualties, and the American bombing <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as highly accurate. The expectation of further attacks caused the prices of food and other commodities to rise, however, as people stockpiled necessities; Japanese attempts to stop this hoarding and profiteering were not successful.|$|E
