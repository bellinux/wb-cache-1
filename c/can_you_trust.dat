Lagun Ein was the lowest ranking member of the 30-member Hanthawaddy delegation led by Byat Za to negotiate the ceasefire terms with their Ava counterparts, and {{to set up a}} meeting between the two kings. During the negotiations, the Ava commander Thado routinely asked Lagun Ein if Pegu was negotiating in good faith. Lagun Ein answered with brutal honesty: [...] "Fool, this is war. You'll kill me if you can. I'll kill you if I can. How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>trust</b> anyone?" ...|$|E
