5|$|<b>Civilians</b> <b>who</b> {{took part}} in the {{evacuation}} suffered the consequences of the military action along Route 7. Most of the <b>civilians</b> <b>who</b> followed the military convoy were either relatives of soldiers or officers in the army, or were government civil servants. Of the estimated 400,000 <b>civilians</b> <b>who</b> initially {{took part in}} the march, only a handful actually reached their destinations in the Mekong region. In addition to the casualties inflicted upon them by North Vietnamese artillery, the civilians were also hit by air strikes from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. As a result of those huge losses, Route 7 became known as the ‘convoy of tears’.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{the concept}} of {{liberating}} the spirits of the soldiers and <b>civilians</b> <b>who</b> were sacrificed during the Japanese invasion in World War II, the temple of Poh Ern Shih was constructed {{on the site of the}} bloodshed on Chwee Chian Hill. It was established in 1954 as a modest single storey temple by philanthropist Lee Choon Seng (1888—1966), as one of the few Chinese Mahayana temples in Singapore dedicated to the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva.|$|E
5|$|Burning houses {{suspected}} of being partisan meeting places and poisoning water wells became common practice for soldiers of the German 9th Army. At Kharkov, the fourth largest city in the Soviet Union, food was provided only to {{the small number of}} <b>civilians</b> <b>who</b> worked for the Germans, with the rest designated to slowly starve. Thousands of Soviets were deported to Germany to be used as slave labor beginning in 1942.|$|E
5|$|<b>Civilians</b> <b>who</b> died as {{a result}} of enemy action during the Second World War are commemorated {{differently}} from those that {{died as a}} result of military service. They are commemorated by name through the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour located in St George's Chapel in Westminster Abbey. In addition to its mandated duties, the Commission maintains, under arrangement with applicable governments, over 40,000 non-Commonwealth war graves and over 25,000 non-war military and civilian graves.|$|E

5|$|Like most {{strategic}} bombing during World War II, {{the aim of}} the USAAF {{offensive against}} Japan was to destroy the enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale. <b>Civilians</b> <b>who</b> took part in the war effort through such activities as building fortifications and manufacturing munitions and other war materials in factories and workshops were considered combatants in a legal sense and therefore liable to be attacked.|$|E
5|$|The two villages {{were to be}} {{assaulted}} simultaneously—Gberi Bana, {{where the}} Royal Irish were held, by the SAS and Magbeni by the paras. In addition to the remaining Royal Irish soldiers, the SAS were also tasked with extracting Lieutenant Musa Bangura—the patrol's SLA liaison, whose extraction was given the same priority {{as that of the}} Royal Irish—and a group of Sierra Leonean <b>civilians</b> <b>who</b> were being held by the West Side Boys.|$|E
5|$|After a long siege, Andi Guru and Tiku's former {{lieutenant}} Tandi Bunna'– both by {{then working}} for the Dutch– approached Tiku on 26 October and offered a cease fire. Although initially unwilling, Tiku was reportedly convinced by <b>civilians</b> <b>who</b> reminded him that his mother– {{who had died in}} the siege– needed to be buried. After three days of peaceful intermingling, on the night of 30 October the Dutch forces took over the fortress, appropriated all weapons, and captured Tiku. He and his soldiers were forced to go to Tondon.|$|E

5|$|After his defeat, Macrinus {{sent his}} son Diadumenian to Artabanus V of Parthia, while he himself {{returned}} to Antioch, proclaiming himself victorious over Elagabalus in battle. News spread of Macrinus' defeat, however, and many <b>civilians</b> <b>who</b> had supported him were slain {{in the city}} and on the roads. Macrinus then shaved off his beard and hair to disguise himself {{as a member of the}} military police. Fleeing the city at night on horseback, he reached Cilicia along with a few companions, masqueraded as a military courier, and secured a carriage to drive to Eribolon, near Nicomedia. From there he set sail for Chalcedon.|$|E
5|$|After {{securing}} the island, the Allied forces developed Labuan into a significant base. The 24th Brigade {{left from the}} island to capture {{the eastern shore of}} Brunei Bay in late June, and the island's airfield was repaired and expanded to host Royal Australian Air Force units. While occupying Labuan, the Allies had to reconstruct the island's infrastructure and provide assistance to thousands of <b>civilians</b> <b>who</b> had been rendered homeless by the pre-invasion bombardment. Following the war, a major Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery was established on Labuan.|$|E
5|$|Early on, many barracks at Birkenau {{were taken}} apart by <b>civilians</b> <b>who</b> used the {{materials}} {{to rebuild their}} own homes, levelled out {{in the construction of}} Auschwitz II. The poorest residents sifted the crematoria ashes in search of nuggets from melted gold, before the warning shots were fired. The POW camp for the German prisoners of war was used by the Soviet NKVD until 1947. In the two years, the Soviets dismantled and exported the IG Farben factories to the USSR. Meanwhile, Soviet and Polish investigators worked to document the war crimes of the SS.|$|E

5|$|However, in 1955, in {{a similar}} case {{involving}} another woman, Mrs. Clarice B. Covert, who had killed her husband in England with an axe, Federal District Court Judge Edward A. Tamm ruled that <b>civilians</b> <b>who</b> accompany military forces overseas could not be imprisoned by military courts. The two cases, Kinsella v. Krueger and Reid v. Covert, went to the US Supreme Court, which affirmed that military trials of civilians were indeed constitutional, only to reverse itself a year later {{in a review of}} the decisions. Dorothy was released, and went to live with Krueger in San Antonio.|$|E

5|$|On 26 March 1944, the Strachwitz Battle Group {{consisting}} of the German 170th, 11th, and 227th Infantry Divisions and tanks, attacked the flanks of the Soviet 109th Rifle Corps south of the Tallinn railway, supported by an air strike. The tanks led the attack and the East Prussian grenadiers followed, penetrating the fortified positions of the Soviet rifle corps. By {{the end of the}} day, the Soviet 72nd and parts of the 109th Rifle Corps in the Westsack (west sack) of the bridgehead were encircled. The rest of the Soviet rifle corps retreated, shooting the local <b>civilians</b> <b>who</b> had been used for carrying ammunition and supplies from the rear.|$|E

5|$|On March 27 {{the eight}} soldiers, Captain Preston, and four <b>civilians</b> <b>who</b> {{were in the}} Customs House and were alleged to have fired shots, were all indicted for murder. Bostonians {{continued}} to be hostile to the troops and their dependents. General Gage, convinced the troops were doing more harm than good, ordered the 29th Regiment out of the province in May. Governor Hutchinson {{took advantage of the}} ongoing high tensions to orchestrate delays of the trials until later in the year.|$|E
5|$|On the West German side, {{there were}} no fortifications of any kind, nor even any patrol roads in most areas. Warning signs (Grenzschilder) with {{messages}} such as Achtung! Zonengrenze! ("Danger! Zonal border!") or Halt! Hier Zonengrenze ("Stop! Zonal border here") notified visitors. Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents. Signs in English and German provided notifications of {{the distance to the}} border to prevent accidental crossings. No such restriction applied to Western <b>civilians,</b> <b>who</b> were free {{to go up to the}} border line, and {{there were no}} physical obstacles to stop their crossing it.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) is an {{intergovernmental}} organisation of six independent member states whose principal {{function is to}} mark, record and maintain the graves and places of commemoration of Commonwealth of Nations military service members {{who died in the}} two World Wars.
