60|$|Turning round, on {{the other}} side of the terrace, under a <b>caper-bush</b> that hung like a blood-stain from the grey wall above her, stood a little grey woman whose fingers were busy. Like the grey church, she made me feel as if I were not in existence. I was {{wandering}} by the parapet of heaven, looking down. But she stood back against the solid wall, under the <b>caper-bush,</b> unobserved and unobserving. She was like a fragment of earth, she was a living stone of the terrace, sun-bleached. She took no notice of me, who was hesitating looking down at the earth beneath. She stood back under the sun-bleached solid wall, like a stone rolled down and stayed in a crevice.|$|E
60|$|Which she did. She {{had stopped}} talking, {{did not look}} at me any more, but went on with her spinning, the brown shuttle {{twisting}} gaily. So she stood, belonging to the sunshine and the weather, taking no more notice of me than of the dark-stained <b>caper-bush</b> which hung from the wall above her head, whilst I, waiting at her side, was like the moon in the daytime sky, overshone, obliterated, in spite of my black clothes.|$|E
60|$|She saw {{merely a}} man's figure, a {{stranger}} standing near. I {{was a bit}} of the outside, negligible. She remained as she was, clear and sustained like an old stone upon the hillside. She stood short and sturdy, looking for the most part straight in front, unseeing, but glancing from time to time, with a little, unconscious attention, at the thread. She was slightly more animated than the sunshine and the stone and the motionless <b>caper-bush</b> above her. Still her fingers went along the strand of fleece near her breast.|$|E
50|$|A {{scrambling}} shrub or climber, {{usually with}} hooked spines on the stem. Two varieties are known in South Africa; var. fascicularis (zigzag <b>caper-bush)</b> and var. zeyheri (coast zigzag <b>caper-bush).</b> The most notable {{difference between these}} two varieties is that var. fascicularis has indented (notched) leaf-tips whereas var. zeyheri has pointed leaf-tips. The spines on the coast zigzag <b>caper-bush</b> are usually reduced or absent. The fragrant flowers are whitish and produced on leafless side branchlets which resemble spikes or racemes. The fruit are spherical and 6-15 mm in diameter, ripening to purple-black.|$|E
50|$|Capparis fascicularis, the zigzag <b>caper-bush,</b> is a {{plant in}} the Capparaceae family and is native to Africa.|$|E
50|$|The white-throated robin-chat {{is mainly}} insectivorous but also eats small {{vertebrates}} and some plant material. Its diet includes beetles, termites, ants, crickets, caterpillars, bugs, spiders and millipedes. It also consumes {{the fruits of}} the woolly <b>caper-bush</b> (Capparis tomentosa), the tassel-berry (Antidesma venosum), the sand raisin (Grewia microthyrsa), the magic guarrie (Euclea divinorum) and the dune guarrie (Euclea racemosa).|$|E
