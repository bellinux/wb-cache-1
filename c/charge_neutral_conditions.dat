Complex coacervate core micelles, also called PIC micelles, block ionomer complexes, and interpolyelectrolyte complexes, are formed in thermodynamic equilibrium under <b>charge</b> <b>neutral</b> <b>conditions</b> (pH 8, 1  mM NaNO₃, T  =  25  °C) through electrostatic interaction between the core-forming P 2 MVP and PAA blocks. 2 D ¹H NOESY NMR experiments show no cross-correlations between PEO and PVOH blocks, indicating their segregation in the micellar corona.

40|$|The {{effects of}} charge doping on the {{structural}} deformation {{and on the}} electronic structure of armchair single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) bundles are investigated through first-principles calculations. In particular, we select a (6; 6) SWNT as an example and we calculate a mechanical deformation in the SWNT bundles {{as a function of}} gate voltage, which could serve as a basis of the electromechanical actuators in an artificial muscle. We find that the magnitudes of the actuation responses such as strain and stress of the (6; 6) SWNT bundle in the case of hole doping are substantially larger than those of electron doping. The (6; 6) SWNT bundle also exhibits a low-symmetry and opens an energy band gap of about 0. 41 eV around the <b>charge</b> <b>neutral</b> <b>condition,</b> which allows a semiconductor-to-metal transition in the electron-doping regime when the relative shift of the Fermi energy goes up to 0. 60 eV, above which the Young modulus increases...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} Gum Arabic (GA) on the zeta potential-pH and yield stress-pH {{behaviour}} of α-Al 2 O 3, TiO 2 and ZrO 2 dispersions were evaluated. GA is amphoteric in character as it contains protein fractions. It's macromolecule has a molecular weight ranging from 50   000 to several million. In aqueous solution, the GA molecule assumed a very compact structure. Upon adsorption it will form a relatively thick protrusion {{from the surface}} that may act as a steric layer or participate in bridging. At <b>charge</b> <b>neutral</b> <b>condition,</b> GA increased the maximum yield stress, τymax, at pH > 5. 0 {{by as much as}} 60 – 80 % for both α-Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 dispersions. This strengthening of the network structure was attributed to bridging. In contrast GA decreased the τymax of TiO 2 dispersions at pH < 5. 0. Here the prevailing interaction was steric. Bridging effect was not important because the free carboxylate group, responsible for bridging, was uncharged at pH < 5. 0...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of new particles for the ternary system involving sulfuric acid, water vapor and ammonia {{has been studied}} in detail. The nucleation rates were obtained from experiments at the CERN CLOUD chamber which allows the measurement of new particle formation under very well defined conditions. Some of its key features are the suppression of contaminants at the technological limit and a very precise control {{of a wide range}} of temperatures, trace gas concentrations and nucleation rates. The effect of ionizing radiation on the ternary nucleation rates was investigated by using the CERN proton synchrotron beam (beam conditions), natural galactic cosmic rays (gcr conditions) as well as the high voltage clearing field inside the chamber to suppress the effect of <b>charges</b> (<b>neutral</b> <b>conditions).</b> The dependence of the nucleation rate on ion concentration, sulfuric acid and ammonia concentration as well as temperature was studied extensively.

40|$|The {{molecular}} weight (Mw) effect of polystyrene sulphonate (PSS) on the yield stress of ZrO 2 dispersion was evaluated. Three "monodispersed" samples with Mw of 1430, 9960 and 130, 000, and two broad distribution samples of Mw 70, 000 and 1. 0 million were investigated. Adsorbed PSS {{gave rise to}} charged patch attraction that enhanced the maximum yield stress, τ y max, of dispersions at <b>charge</b> <b>neutral</b> <b>condition</b> [3]. As a PSS patch consists of only one molecule, the patch size should increase with increasing Mw. For PSS of Mw 1430 with just only seven repeating units the patch formed would be rectangular (linear) and small with a high charge density. For Mw of 9960 and higher, the patch would be irregular in shape with a smaller charge density. At a moderate surface coverage of ˜ 20 %, the τ y max increases quite sharply from Mw 9960 to 130, 000 and very gradually from 130, 000 to 1. 0 million. From Mw 9960 to 130, 000, {{the strength of the}} patch attraction increases quite strongly with increasing patch size. From Mw 130, 000 to 1 million, the small increase in τ y max reflected a limiting patch size effect. At the limiting size, the attraction is at maximum strength. At the same coverage, PSS of Mw 1430 also displayed a strong charge patch attraction. This was attributed to a higher number of charged patch interactions at the closest point of separation and also to the high charge density of the PSS patch. The low surface coverage of 6 % revealed no significant {{molecular weight}} effect on τ y max. The network structure consisted of a mixture of charge patch and bare surface interactions...|$|R
30|$|Bufalin-loaded PEGylated liposomes {{exhibited}} a negative surface charge {{with a larger}} absolute value than the bufalin-loaded liposomes with a positive surface charge. The zeta potential is mainly determined by the surface properties. The unmodified bufalin-loaded liposomes were neutral, and their potentials were generally within ±[*] 5  mV. However, DSPE is not <b>charged</b> under <b>neutral</b> <b>conditions,</b> but the preparation process cannot be completely neutral, so DSPE is negatively charged. Meanwhile, the zeta potential of macromolecule PEG is about negative for several millivolts, near neutral negative potential. Therefore, after the surface modification of DSPE-PEG 2000 on bufalin-loaded liposomes, the zeta potential of bufalin-loaded PEGylated liposomes is negative. These {{findings suggest that the}} surface modification of DSPE-PEG 2000 changes the surface electric potentials of liposomes, which enhanced their stability. It had been confirmed by in vitro stability test. Li et al. [12] employed a liposome co-delivery system that coupled anti-CD 40 mAbs to the surface of PEGylated liposomes wrapped with bufalin. The liposomes were synthesized with a composition of bufalin, cholesterol, EPC, DSPE-PEG 2000, and DSPE-PEG 2000 -Mal in a molar ratio of 20 : 55 : 5 : 5 : 15, respectively. Then anti-CD 40 monoclonal antibody was conjugated to the liposomes through the maleimide-thiol reaction for the preparation of bufalin liposome-anchored anti-CD 40. With regard to the stability profile, it is only mentioned that the negative surface charge suggests excellent stability without clear and definite data description.|$|R
30|$|Organic {{modification}} {{is almost}} exclusively required to obtain desirable properties for a MSN system {{in order to}} provide for eligible biobehavior. The added value in organic modification may include dispersion stability, surface charge tuning, stealth properties, anchoring points for biofunctionalization (antibodies, proteins, peptides, targeting ligands and drug molecules), increased hydrophilicity, molecular gate-keeping, stimuli responsiveness, controlled cleavage of surface-bound coating or moieties, and so forth. On a less sophisticated level, it is generally believed that a net positive charge is beneficial in maximizing cellular uptake due to attraction to the negatively charged cell membrane. Thus, functionalization with positively charged surface groups is frequently applied to enhance cellular uptake. This is also the primary reason why we decided to functionalize our particles with the cationic polyelectrolyte PEI. Aside from enhanced cellular uptake, the branched structure of PEI also offers a higher amount of terminal primary amino groups than possible to attain via conventional amino functionalization, simultaneously providing increased electrostatic suspension stability to the system and possibly introducing pH-dependent molecular gate properties along with enabling endosomal escape ability, both of which would be utilized when carrying drug cargo for intracellular release[31]. To investigate the effect on cellular uptake upon derivatization of the PEI layer, we also capped the terminal primary amino groups with either uncharged acetyl groups or acidic (negatively <b>charged</b> under <b>neutral</b> <b>conditions)</b> succinic acid groups. The uptake in terms of positive cell percentage of the whole series of particles with (or without) different functionalization is presented in Figure[*] 7.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} ionic {{copolymers}} with hydrophobic segments on the yield stress–pH behavior of ZrO 2 dispersions were evaluated. These polyelectrolytes were two alternating copolymers; diisobutylene-maleic acid and alpha-methyl styrene-maleic acid, and a random styrene-maleic acid copolymer. At low concentrations, all three copolymers caused {{a much greater}} reduction in the maximum yield stress, tau ymax (at the <b>neutral</b> <b>charge</b> <b>condition),</b> compared with hydrophilic polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid-ester polymers. The reduction in tau ymax was as much as 75 %. The much larger reduction in tau ymax was attributed to a thicker steric layer formed by the ionic copolymers with hydrophobic segments. At higher concentrations, all three copolymers caused tau ymax to increase. This was attributed to significant hydrophobic effects and attraction. The degree of hydrophobic segment aggregation at the closest point of interaction between particles is now higher. This also caused an overall increase in the entropy relative to the state when the particles are far apart, as the degree of hydrogen bonding among water molecules is less when the hydrophobic segments are aggregated...|$|R
40|$|Adsorption of Enrofloxacin (ENR) on {{minerals}} {{dominates the}} fate and transport of ENR in the environment. In this study, the sorption process of ENR on montmorillonite {{and the impact}} of dissolved organic matters (DOMs) on ENR-montmorillonite interactions were investigated using in situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and two-dimensional correlation analysis (2 D-COS). Negative peaks were observed in the 3400 - 2900 cm(- 1) region due to the loss of hydrated protons at montmorillonite surfaces. The primary characteristic peaks of adsorbed ENR molecules were resolved in the 1800 - 1100 cm(- 1) range. The results of 2 D-COS suggested the sorption process was initiated by the interaction of hydrated protons on montmorillonite surfaces with diverse moieties of ENR molecules depending on pH. The sorption mechanism of ENR was mainly cation exchange at acidic <b>condition,</b> <b>charge</b> neutralization at <b>neutral</b> <b>condition,</b> and proton transfer at alkaline condition. DOM could interact with piperazinyl amine groups of dissolved ENR, which changed the interaction sequence of ENR molecule with montmorillonite surfaces. Electrostatic interaction was the predominant driving force for the interaction between DOM and dissolved ENR. H-donor-acceptor interaction and pi-pi interaction may also be responsible to this interaction. Insights gained from this study improve our understandings on sorption mechanism of ENR and similar ionic organic pollutants in soil systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{quantum well}} solar cell (QWSC) has been {{proposed}} as a flexible means to ensuring current matching for tandem cells. This paper explores the further advantage afforded by the indication that QWSCs operate in the radiative limit because radiative contribution to the dark current is seen to dominate in experimental data at biases corresponding to operation under concentration. The dark currents of QWSCs are analysed {{in terms of a}} light and dark current model. The model calculates the spectral response (QE) from field bearing regions and <b>charge</b> <b>neutral</b> layers and from the quantum wells by calculating the confined densities of states and absorption coefficient, and solving transport equations analytically. The total dark current is expressed as the sum of depletion layer and <b>charge</b> <b>neutral</b> radiative and non radiative currents consistent with parameter values extracted from QE fits to data. The depletion layer dark current is a sum of Shockley-Read-Hall non radiative, and radiative contributions. The <b>charge</b> <b>neutral</b> region contribution is expressed in terms of the ideal Shockley radiative and non-radiative currents modified to include surface recombination. This analysis shows that the QWSC is inherently subject to the fundamental radiative efficiency limit at high currents where the radiative dark current dominates, whereas good homojunction cells are well described by the ideal Shockley picture where the limit is determined by radiative and non radiative recombination in the <b>charge</b> <b>neutral</b> layers of the cell.
