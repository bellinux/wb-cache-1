However, under dynamic loading, excavator bucket teeth are subjected to severe abrasive wear. The objective of this work was to improve the service life of the excavator bucket teeth in order to decrease the idle time required to reinstate the teeth periodically during excavation. This objective {{was carried out by}} overlaying the excavator bucket teeth (of high tensile steel) with four different wear resistant hardfacing alloys by manual metal arc welding. <b>Comparative</b> <b>wear</b> tests on a regular tooth and overlayed excavator bucket teeth were conducted in the field and laboratory (ASTM G- 99, pin-on-disc apparatus), where the effect of hardfacing alloys on the extent of wear and the wear characteristics of the excavator teeth were examined...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} a <b>comparative</b> <b>wear,</b> corrosion and wear–corrosion (the last {{one in a}} simulated physiological solution) study of graphite-like a-C:H (GLCH) films deposited on bare and nitrided Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy. Films, deposited by r. f. PACVD, presented low porosity and promoted high corrosion resistance. The friction coefficient of the films was very lowwith appreciablewear resistance at roomconditions. However, due to the simultaneous action of both load and the corrosive environment in wear–corrosion tests a marked reduction in the coating lifetime was observed. Unexpectedly, films deposited on the nitrided alloy presented a lifetime at least ten times shorter than that of films on bare alloy. We explain such a result in terms of film/substrate interaction. The weak GLCH/nitride alloy interaction facilitates fluid penetration between the film and the substratewhich leads to a fast film delamination. Such an interpretation is supported by force curve measurements, which show that the interaction between GLCH and nitrided alloy is four times weaker than that between GLCH and bare alloy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Use of {{alternative}} fuels like vegetables oil or Biodiesel, purely or blended with diesel, are making use as substitute of mineral diesel which has harmful emission and limited store. One important aspect other that properties, performance, emission, combustion {{of alternative}} fuels is wear characteristics. Some important components of an engine are piston, piston rings, cylinder head, liner etc. where major wear takes place. In this present work, a four stroke single cylinder diesel engine {{is run by}} alternative fuel. The alternative fuel is used here Neem-Diesel blend.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a <b>comparative</b> <b>wear</b> {{behavior}} study of {{three categories of}} materials viz, as cast, cast aged (casting followed by T 6) and forge aged (forging followed by T 6) has been investigated. Neither melt treatment nor solid state processing (like aging and forging) seems to be altering the wear behavior of the materials drastically. Cast aged A 356 materials exhibit higher wear resistance compared to as cast and forge aged A 356 materials. Further, {{it was observed that}} cast aged samples register lower coefficient of friction compared to other samples. It is also noted that the difference in wear behavior is revealed only at conditions of higher load, higher speed and longer sliding distance of testing. At lower regimes the difference is marginal. Among cast aged samples, ones treated with combined addition exhibit better wear resistance compared to other materials. Samples treated with combined addition register lowest coefficient of friction followed by samples treated with Sr, those with B, those with Ti and untreated ones. Abrasive wear mechanism is found to be operative in the regime of higher loading and higher velocity of sliding. Adhesive wear mechanism seems to be dominating the wear process at the lower regime of load and velocity of sliding...|$|E

40|$|During the Apollo program, {{the space}} suit outer layer fabrics were badly abraded {{after just a}} few Extravehicular Activities (EVAs). For example, the Apollo 12 {{commander}} reported abrasive wear on the boots, which penetrated the outer layer fabric into the thermal protection layers after less than eight hours of surface operations. Current plans for the Constellation Space Suit Element require the space suits to support hundreds of hours of EVA on the Lunar surface, creating a challenge for space suit designers to utilize materials advances made over the last forty years and improve upon the space suit fabrics used in the Apollo program.

For example, there are needs for supporting anchor rods in to resist both corrosion and wear attacks during operation. In the present work, electroless plating was employed to prepare Ni-P coating on RB 400 steel for improving surface performance and increasing usage of anchor rod in bracing project. Surface and cross-section morphologies of the obtained coating were measured by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and optical microscope (OM).

40|$|Purpose: of {{the study}} was to test the {{applicability}} of different cutting tools in producing tool-making equipment and to put the emphasis on the mechanisms present in the high-speed-cutting process. Design/methodology/approach: used are optical and SEM observation and <b>comparative</b> analysis of <b>wear</b> types at the cutting edges of the end-mill cutters. Findings: the characteristic wear of end-mill cutters is caused by of the fact that the cutting speed is no longer the main influential factor on wear, but more likely wear is the consequence of the high-speed of the tool movements (feed rate), the tool is worn out when it can no longer generate a prescribed surface quality or assure required workpiece accuracy. Research limitations/implications: all observed parameters, which are difficult to predict, are closely connected with the appearance of favourable wear at the tool tip of the end mill cutter. Practical implications: results presented were also confirmed in the production environment, when dies were produced for practical use. Originality/value: is in description of tool life in HSC, which is related to the tool wear pattern, chip shape and - particularly in advanced machining operations - the surface texture and workpiece accuracy. Optimisation of the cutting parameters in HSC is thus not made with respect to the maximum removal rate, but rather to the low level of the cutting forces and better surface quality...|$|R
40|$|Hard turning is a {{developing}} technology that offers many potential benefits compared to grinding, which remains the standard finishing process for critical hardened steel surfaces. To increase {{the implementation of}} this technology, questions {{about the ability of}} this process to produce surfaces that meet surface finish and integrity requirements must be answered. Additionally, the economics of the process must be justified, which requires a better understanding of tool wear patterns and life predictions. An ongoing <b>comparative</b> study of <b>wear</b> rates and tool lives under varying cutting parameters is presented here. To date, the study has consisted of seventeen different machining conditions with four different cutting tool materials. Tool life results agree with previous research in this area, indicating that polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PCBN) tools with low CBN content have improved lives resulting from the benefits of the ceramic binders compared to the cobalt binder typically used for higher CBN content tools. More interesting is a resulting trend in flank wear patterns that could currently help to predict tool life under certain cutting conditions. Further work is being done to understand the wear process in an attempt to model this relationship for a larger range of conditions. 2. BACKGROUND The potential economic benefits of hard turning can be offset by rapid tool wear or premature tool failure if the brittle cutting tools required for hard turning are not used properly.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined This work {{presents}} a <b>comparative</b> study regarding <b>wear</b> behavior between a novel abrasion resistant cast iron, "Carbide Steel" {{and a number}} of conventional tool materials frequently used in the automotive industry. Carbide Steel is basically a high-Cr white cast iron heavily alloyed with cemented carbide. The high chromium content and additional alloying elements like WC. TiC or NbC results in a material containing a large portion of hard, wear-resistant carbides with a composition different from conventional white irons normally used in wear applications. Characteristic properties for the material are: superior as-cast properties, improved wear resistance and hardness. The as-cast hardness of Carbide Steel is comparative to hardened steel but depending on desirable properties of the wear part the alloying content can be varied within a wide range. An interesting aspect of the material is potential for sustainable manufacturing, {{due to the fact that}} the critical alloying elements are added in the form of recycled carbide inserts. The experimental work was carried out in a U-bending test equipment to simulate conditions in a stamping process. One type of sheet material was used and seven different conventional tool materials were evaluated. The selection of tool materials ranged from white cast irons to tool-steels and powder steels. The wear patterns were analyzed and expressed in percentages of reduction of weight of the test specimens, galling tendency and temperature variations during the experiments. All parameters were correlated to the number of strokes. The press force was measured and a friction coefficient was calculated. An important conclusion from the experimental work is that Carbide Steel has a significantly higher wear resistance compared to the other conventional tool materials evaluated. Galling is also significantly reduced when using Carbide Steel. The volume part of carbides and the relative size of the same play a significant role in the process leading to less galling and wear, when using Carbide Steel as a tool material.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made {{concerning}} the tribological behaviour of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) during water-lubricated reciprocating sliding wear. The experimental work has been extended to study also the effect of molecular weight, fillers, lubrication, counterface roughness and sliding configuration on the polymer's transfer characteristics. The wear behaviour of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) has been included for <b>comparative</b> studies. The <b>worn</b> material was studied using stylus profilometry, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), {{energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy}} (EDS), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and mass spectrometry. The effect of two fillers, namely glass beads and a titanium-based inorganic filler on the friction and wear behaviour of UHMWPE has been investigated as a function of counterface roughness (Rₐ). It was found that the filled material exhibited lower wear rates than the unfilled material on the rougher counterface. The filled material was also found to be more sensitive to a change in Rₐ and showed higher wear rates than the unfilled polymer on the smooth counterface. A uniform and coherent transfer film is found on the rougher counterface but the transfer film for the titanium-based filler was patchy on the smooth counterface. No coherent transfer film was found when sliding was conducted parallel to the grinding direction on the steel counterface, resulting in relatively high wear rates. Polymer transfer was patchy, the amount increasing as the sliding distance increased. The observed phenomena are explained in terms of mechanical interlocking and chemical bonding of the polymeric material with the metal counterface. An increase in molecular weight did not significantly improve the wear resistance of the UHMWPE. Small variations in counterface roughness values (Rₐ) were found to have a much greater effect on the wear rates than changes in molecular weight. The steady-state wear rate of the polymer was furthermore found to be more dependent on an adherent transfer film rather than a change in bulk morphology. Although PTFE exhibited low friction coefficients, the high wear rates obtained by this polymer is explained by the polymer's inability to form a transfer film under water lubrication, while any film that forms under dry sliding wear is easily peeled off the surface. Significant improvements in wear are found when fillers are added to the polymer. The wear rates for PTFE under dry sliding are similar to those obtained for UHMWPE under water lubrication. Transfet of UHMWPE material to the metal counterface during sliding wear involves interlamellar shear of the polymer and results {{in the development of a}} highly oriented transfer film. Significant differences have been found in the degree of crystallinity, crystallite size and orientation in the deformed surface layers of the polymer and debris compared with those of the bulk polymer. The worn surface of the polymer shows slightly increased crystallinity but the crystallinity of the debris is much higher than that of the bulk whilst the crystallite size is much reduced...|$|R
