25|$|Zeus {{then gave}} her the ability to remove her eyes. The purpose of this ability is unclear in Diodorus, but other {{versions}} state Lamia's ability to remove her eyes came with the gift of prophecy. Zeus did this to appease Lamia in her grief {{over the loss of}} her children and to let her rest since she could not <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shwetha is now distraught {{with being}} in the limelight and understands what Nikhil had tried to tell her. Nikhil, the actor, meets Shwetha and tells her that he cannot decide if the present moment is a dream or reality but he is {{ultimately}} happy. Asking Shwetha to <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> Nikhil jumps off the roof to the confusion of everyone present, including the contract killer waiting to kill him.|$|E
25|$|In later stories, Lamia was cursed {{with the}} {{inability}} to <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{so that she would}} always obsess over the image of her dead children. Some accounts (see Horace, below) say Hera forced Lamia to devour her own children. Myths variously describe Lamia's monstrous (occasionally serpentine) appearance as a result of either Hera's wrath, the pain of grief, the madness that drove her to murder, or—in some rare versions—a natural result of being Hecate's daughter.|$|E

25|$|Lamia was a {{queen of}} Libya, whom Zeus loved. Hera turned {{her into a}} monster and murdered their {{children}}. Or, alternatively, she killed Lamia's children and the grief turned her into a monster. Lamia was cursed with the inability to <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{so that she would}} always obsess over the image of her dead children. Zeus gave her the gift {{to be able to take}} her eyes out to rest, and then put them back in. Lamia was envious of other mothers and ate their children.|$|E
500|$|Scully goes to warn Fellig that he {{is about}} to be charged for murder, and accuses him of {{profiting}} from people's deaths. In his darkroom, Fellig shows Scully a photo of a dead woman with an odd fuzzy shape around her head, which the photographer claims is Death. When asked why he bothers to try to photograph Death, Fellig says that it is so he can look Death in the face and finally die. He claims to be 149 years old, and says he cannot kill himself. Scully points out that most people would like to live forever, but Fellig says that he has experienced everything, and that even love does not last forever. Suddenly, he notices that Scully is gray, and says, [...] "Count your blessings." [...] When she asks about the science of his immortality, he says he was meant to die of yellow fever, but he refused to look Death in the face, so instead Death took the kind nurse who had taken care of him. [...] Fellig takes a photo just as Ritter enters and shoots. The bullet passes right through the camera and through Fellig into Scully, who collapses. While Ritter rushes to call an ambulance, Fellig asks Scully whether she saw Death and begs her to <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> He covers her hand with his own. The color returns to Scully's hand as Fellig's turns gray. Looking up, he dies.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of December 3, 1988, Ruiz, Reyes, their son Fernando, and Fernando's wife Leticia, who was {{pregnant}} with their fourth child, were all praying the Rosary. [...] Ruiz in particular was praying for her son Reyes Jr., who was struggling with cocaine addiction and for Fernando and Leticia's marriage. [...] During the final decade, Ruiz says she saw a light emanating from {{a portrait of the}} Immaculate Heart of Mary that grew brighter until it forced her to <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] At that moment, the Virgin spoke to her: [...] "Don't you know that I am {{going to take care of}} your children?" [...] Ruiz was overcome with emotion and began to cry, calling out, [...] "Qué linda! Qué linda!" [...] ("She's beautiful! She's beautiful!").|$|E

2500|$|The gandharva Kali was in {{love with}} Varuthini and had been {{rejected}} by her in the past. He saw how she hungered for the Brahmin, so he took on the appearance of Pravara and came before the courtesan. He led her into the bedchamber and told her to <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> during their sex [...] [...] As they made love, Varuthini noticed that his body became flaming hot and believed it was because his Brahmin spirit was infused with the sacrificial fire. After climax, Kali, still-as-Pravara, left the apsara and returned to his abode. Varuthini soon became pregnant and nine months later gave birth to a human child that not only looked like the Brahmin but possessed his soul as well. The authors of the book Science in Culture comment this was an example of the Sanskrit phrase [...] "from his semen and from her thinking," [...] meaning the child was indeed Pravara's child because she believed it was his.|$|E

60|$|At last Yvonne {{contrived}} {{to stand}} on her feet; {{but she had to}} <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and to remain quite still for awhile after that, for her ears were buzzing and her head swimming: she thought that she must fall if she moved and mayhap lose consciousness.|$|E
60|$|Now {{when the}} emperor {{lay down in}} it he seemed {{as if he had}} grown a hundred times heavier than usual, yet he felt a kind of calm that was quite new to him. But the empress felt as if she was lying on thorns and nettles, and could not <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

60|$|His arms quickly closed round her, {{she felt}} his hot breath against her cheek.

60|$|The guard-room {{itself was}} more brilliantly lighted than the {{corridor}} outside. The sudden glare {{of two or}} three lamps placed about the room caused her momentarily to <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> that were aching with many shed and unshed tears. The air was rank and heavy with the fumes of tobacco, of wine and stale food. A large barred window gave on the corridor immediately above the door.|$|E

[...] and after a moment of uneasy silence there was a rush of running feet along the front.|$|E
60|$|What use {{to attempt}} escape? As well face the hideous end {{as to be}} dragged down from behind in futile flight.
