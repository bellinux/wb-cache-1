5000|$|Though {{the site}} {{probably}} has {{its origins in}} a Gallo-Roman villa, Commarin is first mentioned, as a maison forte, in a document of 1214. Its seigneurs were a cadet branch of the seigneurs of Sombernon, from the lineage of the first Dukes of Burgundy. [...] In 1346 Jean and his son Jacques de Cortiamble, chamberlain to Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy, rebuilt Commarin as a fortified seat; the size and disposition of this moated stronghold established the placement {{and size of the}} future rebuildings. The two cylindrical towers with conical roofs date from this rebuilding, and the vaulted chapel. Commarin passed to Agnès de Cortiamble, the elder daughter of Jacques, who brought it as part of her dowry to Jean de Dinteville, seigneur des <b>Chenets.</b>|$|R

50|$|Philip Sugden {{was born}} on January 27, 1947 in Moorhouse Road, Kingston-upon-Hull, England, the younger of twin boys. Both boys, John and Philip, became internationally {{acclaimed}} historians. Their father, John Henry Sugden (1914-1996), was a painter and decorator, whose seasonal trade made him vulnerable to spells of unemployment and short hours; their mother, Lily (née Cuthbertson, 1914-1981), eventually took part-time factory work to keep the boys at school. A sister, Sylvia (1937-1954), died in adolescence, but the brothers were constant companions, sharing interests and projects in what became a lifelong partnership. Living just inside the western boundary of the city, they grew up close to the countryside, and enjoying many open spaces; both became great devotees of the natural world. But their greatest inspiration came from literature. Avid readers, they particularly enjoyed the great stories of history, and {{from an early age}} began writing about their interests. The Sugden brothers attended Wold Road Primary School and Ainthorpe High School, where they were encouraged by an innovatory headmaster, Harold F. Brown, and two inspirational teachers, Stanley R. ('Taffy') Thomas and Joan Wright, who recognized their potential. Although conscientious, the boys remained more interested in their own projects than routine schoolwork. At the age of fifteen they both attempted to produce historical novels for publication. John finished his book, but failed to find a publisher. Philip abandoned his companion piece, and both had to satisfy themselves with furnishing primitive features for the school magazine. They left school at the age of 16 and for four years worked as administrators in local industry. Philip was employed by Humber Joiners in Stepney Lane, Hull, and in the offices of the Hull Corporation Parks Department in Ferensway before completing his A-level G. C. E. courses at the Hull College of Commerce. His preference to read for a degree in Zoology was frustrated by weaknesses in his formal science, but he graduated from the University of Hull with the departmental prize in History in 1972. He immediately started working on his Ph.D. under the supervision of Kenneth R. Andrews, but the dissertation on early Stuart maritime expansion remained unfinished, partly because of Sugden's meticulous nature and repeated rewriting, and partly because his grant ran out. In 1976, he took a position at <b>Chenet</b> School in Cannock, where he taught History, English and Economics. But although a very successful teacher, his first love remained research and writing, and he had become absorbed in the history of crime in the Georgian era. A detailed study of the London underworld of Jack Sheppard, a celebrated criminal of the early eighteenth-century, became a lifelong preoccupation.|$|E
30|$|Paleomagnetic secular {{variation}} (PSV) analysis has been employed to constrain the eruption frequency {{down to the}} millennium or century timescale, and to identify the eruption pulses in some LIPs (Makinen et al. 1985; Riisager et al. 2003; Knight et al. 2004; <b>Chenet</b> et al. 2008; Pavlov et al. 2011; Courtillot and Fluteau 2014). The geomagnetic field exhibits {{secular variation}}, both in direction and intensity, in timescales of decades to a century. On the other hand, in many LIPs, successive lava flows yield statistically identical paleomagnetic directions. Such directions are regarded to form a directional group. The lava flows recording a directional group must erupt and cool rapidly relative to the PSV speed. Holocene paleomagnetic data revealed that the mean speed of the geomagnetic directional change is 2 – 7 °/century (Gallet et al. 2002; Hagstrum and Campion 2002; <b>Chenet</b> et al. 2008; Courtillot and Fluteau 2014). Using paleomagnetic directions with uncertainties less than 10 °, <b>Chenet</b> et al. (2008) argued that the lava flows in each directional group in the Deccan trap were emplaced within roughly 100  years. In contrast, the absence of clear directional groups in the Paraná volcanic province has been taken {{as a sign of}} steady volcanic activity without a particular pulse (Dodd et al. 2015). The geomagnetic intensity change on this timescale is not as well-constrained. Nonetheless, a geomagnetic field model based on historical data (Jackson et al. 2000) and recent archaeomagnetic data (Shaar et al. 2015) shows that the maximum intensity change per decade is ~ 5 %.|$|E
