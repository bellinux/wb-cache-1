In 1999, Akşit was promoted to brigadier general of the 14th Mechanized Infantry Brigade in Kars at the Turkish-Armenian border, applying brigade-level TQM. Akşit returned to NATO as a Chief of Plan and Operations (OPX) for the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in September 2001 until 2003.

Objectives: This paper suggests to explain the basics of <b>controlling</b> <b>management</b> in the Koran; the aspects of <b>controlling</b> <b>management</b> in the Koran; the models of <b>controlling</b> <b>management</b> in the Koran. There are six methods used in this study, namely: Method of selection of theme of studies; the method of determining the type of study; method of data collecting; methods of data analysis; approachs to the study. Result: This research has found: First, the basis of controlling management: There are three principles: (1) the theological principle; (2) humanistic principle; (3) maslahah al-mursalah principle. Second, the aspects of <b>controlling</b> <b>management</b> in the Koran: Aspects of micro-macro (the individual-states). Third, there are three models of <b>controlling</b> <b>management</b> in the Koran: (1) self-control (raqabah dzatiyah); (2) <b>control</b> through <b>management.</b> (3) social <b>control.</b> Conclusion: In the Koran the most relevant terms to enhance the environment and social controls are both taqwa (piety) and amar ma'ruf nahi munkar. Both are very important things to protect religion, life, intellect, lineage, wealth and environment.

40|$|Weed {{management}} plays a {{key role}} in the minimization of soil physical degradation processes such as compaction and hydric erosion. Different weed <b>control</b> <b>managements</b> can induce distinct changes in soil structure. One important soil physical attribute used for the analysis of modifications in soil structure is the soil water retention curve (SWRC). The objective of this work was to verify the use of physico-hydrical attributes to understand the effect of weed <b>control</b> <b>managements</b> on soil structure. Two soil layers (0 – 0. 05 and 0. 10 – 0. 15 m) and six weed <b>control</b> <b>managements</b> divided into two groups were analyzed: I. no soil disturbance and ground cover (no weed control, post-emergence herbicide, mechanical mower); and II. soil disturbance and no ground cover (hand-hoe weeding, rotary tiller, pre-emergence herbicide). An area of native forest was used as reference. The results showed that the volumetric water capacity derived from the SWRC can be an interesting tool to evaluate the impact of weed <b>control</b> <b>managements</b> on soil structure. Evaluations of the air-filled porosity variation for different pressure heads also presented interesting findings. Distinct results of the weed <b>control</b> <b>managements</b> were found for the different depths analyzed in relation to the forest. ...|$|R

[...] More recently, the project switched to simply naming new releases after the latest commit number. [...] Releases of Cosmos are divided into two types: the Userkit, and the Devkit. [...] The Userkit"is a pre-packaged release that is updated irregularly, as new and improved features are added. Userkits are generally considered stable, but do not include recent changes and may lack features. [...] The Devkit refers to the source code of Cosmos, and must be built manually. The devkits are usually unstable as they may contain unfinished or untested code. The Devkit can be acquired on GitHub and uses Git as the source <b>control</b> <b>management.</b> [...] Most work on Cosmos is currently aimed at improving debugger functionality and Visual Studio integration. [...] Kernel work is focused on implementing file systems, memory management, and developing a reliable network interface. Syslinux serves as the project's bootloader.|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{personnel}} controlling and its introduction within individual personnel pro- cesses. The first part focuses on <b>controlling</b> <b>management.</b> It mentions the considerable disunity of the terminology resulting in frequent misunderstandings in practice. To avoid this, we should consistently separate reporting and controlling and clarify {{the position of}} controller and manager. We define the basic principles to be complied with when specifying indices and the criteria to introduce personnel controlling into practice. All personnel processes to be provided with the <b>controlling</b> <b>management</b> must at first {{be based on a}} methodology, i. e. a simple and well developed methodology with controlling mechanisms shall be prepared. When introducing the methodology into practice, it is necessary to validate its correctness in the long term. The article shows an exam- ple of a controlling mechanism for an employee assessment process. <b>Controlling</b> <b>management</b> preferentially focuses on each personnel process independently. In practice, specific processes are linked together, they do not exist separately. It is therefore nece- ssary to provide <b>controlling</b> <b>management</b> to related processes. The article focuses on the connecti- ons between the process of employee assessment and the remuneration system (fixed and floating parts of the salary), and employee development and promotion. We describe a procedure of how the usual quality figures can be quantified and then assessed using indices and criteria. Personnel controlling is quite commonly used in practice. It can be used within knowledge management, for example, where one of the obstacles to introducing <b>controlling</b> <b>management</b> to employee knowledge assessment...|$|R
