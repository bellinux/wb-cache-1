40|$|A {{hybrid system}} {{consisting}} of a coherent <b>optical</b> <b>computer</b> and a general purpose dieted computer is proposed for processing a two-dimensional signal. Such a system will hare the speed and high information density of an <b>optical</b> <b>computer</b> and the deci-sion-logic capability, flexibility and high accuracy of a digital computer. The general plan of hybrid computation is that a given signal is first processed on the <b>optical</b> <b>computer,</b> which can perform oil linear operations. A selected portion of the optically processed signal is further processed on a digital computer. The digital computer, in addition, controls tne <b>optical</b> <b>computer,</b> makes decisions {{on the basis of}} processed signal and issues commands to the external devices for further action. It is shown that for successful implementation of the proposed hybrid system, we must have devices capaUe of real time input to the <b>optical</b> <b>computer</b> and devices capable of transmitting data from the digital to the <b>optical</b> <b>computer</b> and vice versa. Furthermore, the optical system has to be further improved in order that the accuracy of computation improves by at least one order of magnitude. 1...|$|R

50|$|Optical {{computing}} {{is to use}} photons {{rather than}} conventional electrons for computing.

40|$|An <b>optical</b> <b>computer</b> is a {{physical}} information processing device that uses photons to transport data from one memory location to another and processes the data while {{it is in this}} form. In contrast, a conventional digital electronic computer uses electric fields (traveling along conductive paths) for this task. The optical data paths in an <b>optical</b> <b>computer</b> are effected by refraction (such as the action of a lens) or reflection (such as the action of a mirror). A principal advantage of an optical data path over an electrical data path is that optical data paths can intersect and even completely overlap without corrupting the data in either path. <b>Optical</b> <b>computers</b> make use of this property to efficiently transform the optically encoded data from one representation to another, for example, to shuffle or reverse the order of an array of parallel paths or to convolve the data in several arrays of parallel paths...|$|R

40|$|Optics {{has been}} used in {{computing}} {{for a number of years}} but the main emphasis has been and continues to be to link portions of computers, for communications, or more intrinsically in devices that have some optical application or component. <b>Optical</b> digital <b>computers</b> are still some years away; however a number of devices that can ultimately lead to real <b>optical</b> <b>computers</b> have already been manufactured.
