40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} develop and {{validate}} a new Chinese <b>reading</b> <b>chart</b> for children. The characteristics of reading profiles among Hong Kong children were also investigated. Methods: A new <b>reading</b> <b>chart</b> was developed using the design principles of the MNREAD chart. Children (N = 169) aged seven to 11 years with normal vision and no developmental or reading difficulties were recruited from four local Hong Kong primary schools located in four different districts. Reading performance was measured using three versions of the new Chinese <b>reading</b> <b>chart</b> for {{children as well as}} six short passages. Repeated reading measures were conducted for 79 participants 4 - 8 weeks later. A linear mixed-model analysis was performed for the reading measures to identify the contribution of each source of variation (individual participant, among-charts within-session and between-sessions, and error) to the total variance. Results: Three reading parameters were derived from the Chinese <b>reading</b> <b>chart</b> for children - maximum reading speed (MRS), critical print size (CPS) and reading acuity (RA). Results from the linear mixed-model and Bland and Altman analyses revealed that all three versions of the chart were reproducible, with little variability among-charts and between-sessions (p < 0. 001). The coefficient of repeatability for the MRS, CPS and RA was 0. 08 logWPM, 0. 16 logMAR and 0. 14 logMAR respectively. The strong correlation between reading speed measured by the chart and ordinary children's reading passages confirmed the usefulness of the chart for assessing children's reading performance (Rc = 0. 67, 95 % CI of 0. 60 - 0. 73). Conclusions: We developed and validated a new Chinese <b>reading</b> <b>chart</b> for children for quantifying reading performance in Chinese children with normal reading ability. This standardised clinical test can be reliably used to measure the MRS, CPS and RA in Chinese-speaking children.

40|$|Web-based social data {{analysis}} tools {{that rely on}} public discussion to produce hypotheses or explanations of patterns and trends in data rarely yield high-quality results in practice. Crowdsourcing offers an alternative approach in which an analyst pays workers to generate such explanations. Yet, asking workers with varying skills, backgrounds and motivations to simply “Explain why a chart is interesting ” can result in irrelevant, unclear or speculative explanations of variable quality. To address these problems, we contribute seven strategies for improving the quality and diversity of worker-generated explanations. Our experiments show that using (S 1) feature-oriented prompts, providing (S 2) good examples, and including (S 3) reference gathering, (S 4) <b>chart</b> <b>reading,</b> and (S 5) annotation subtasks increases the quality of responses by 28 % for US workers and 196 % for non-US workers.

We also show that (S 6) pre-annotating charts can focus workers ’ attention on relevant details, and demonstrate that (S 7) generating explanations iteratively increases explanation diversity without increasing worker attrition. We used our techniques to generate 910 explanations for 16 datasets, and found that 63 % were of high quality. These results demonstrate that paid crowd workers can reliably generate diverse, high-quality explanations that support the analysis of specific datasets...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} factors that may affect reading speed in {{patients}} with diabetic macular edema previously treated with laser photocoagulation. Methods: Consecutive patients with type II diabetes treated with laser photocoagulation for diabetic macular edema (DME) at least twelve months previously, with best corrected visual acuity of better than 65 letters (approximately 20 / 40) measured with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts were included in this study. Patients previously treated with pan-retinal photocoagulation, vitrectomy, intravitreal steroid or anti-VEGF therapy were excluded. Any other ocular co-morbidities that may influence reading ability such as cataract, glaucoma or macular degeneration were also excluded. All patients were refracted by a certified examiner, the following measurements were collected: best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity with Pelli-Robson <b>chart,</b> <b>reading</b> speed with MNREAD chart, microperimetry with Nidek MP 1, and central subfield thickness with Zeiss spectral domain optical coherent topography. Results: The slow reading group had poorer contrast sensitivity (p = 0. 001), reduced retinal sensitivity (p = 0. 027) and less stable fixation (p = 0. 013). Most interestingly the reduced retinal sensitivity findings were driven by the microperimetry value on the right subfield (p = 0. 033), (nasal to the fovea in the right eye and temporal to the fovea in the left eye).

The aim {{of this study is to}} create sentences of equal readability to use in the development of a standardized Arabic continuous text <b>reading</b> <b>chart.</b> MethodsInitially, 109 Arabic pairs of sentences were created for use in constructing a chart with similar layout to the Colenbrander chart. They were created to have the same grade level of difficulty and physical length. Fifty-three adults and sixteen children were recruited to validate the sentences. Reading speed in correct words per minute (CWPM) and standard length words per minute (SLWPM) was measured and errors were counted. Criteria based on reading speed and errors made in each sentence pair were used to exclude sentence pairs with more outlying characteristics, and to select the final group of sentence pairs. ResultsForty-five sentence pairs were selected according to the elimination criteria. For adults, the average reading speed for the final sentences was 166 CWPM and 187 SLWPM and the average number of errors per sentence pair was 0. 21. Childrens’ average reading speed for the final group of sentences was 61 CWPM and 72 SLWPM. Their average error rate was 1. 71.

Integrated crop management (ICM) {{is a combination}} of water, crop, and nutrient management that optimizes the synergistic interaction of these components aiming at improving resource use efficiency, i. e. high productivity of water, land, and labor. The objectives of the study were to investigate the effects of crop establishment method, organic matter amendment, NPK management, and water management on yield of lowland rice. Five series of experiments were conducted at Sukamandi and Kuningan Experimental Stations, West Java. The first experiment was focused on crop establishment method, i. e. plant spacing and number of seedlings per hill. The second, third, and fourth experiments were directed to study the effect of NPK and organic matter applications on rice yield. The fifth experiments was designed to evaluate the effect of water management on rice yield. Results showed that 20 cm x 20 cm plant spacing resulted in the highest grain yield for the new plant type rice varieties. Organic matter and P fertilizer application did not significantly affect grain yield, but the yield response to P fertilization tended to be stronger with organic matter amendment. Split P application did not significantly increase grain yield.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{provide a}} {{consistent}} {{standard for the}} evaluation of different types of presbyopic correction. SETTING: Eye Clinic, School of Life and Health Sciences, Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom. METHODS: Presbyopic corrections examined were accommodating intraocular lenses (IOLs), simultaneous multifocal and monovision contact lenses, and varifocal spectacles. Binocular near visual acuity measured with different optotypes (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and words) and reading metrics assessed with the Minnesota Near Reading <b>chart</b> (<b>reading</b> acuity, critical print size [CPS], CPS reading speed) were intercorrelated (Pearson product moment correlations) and assessed for concordance (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICC]) and agreement (Bland-Altman analysis) for indication of clinical usefulness. RESULTS: Nineteen accommodating IOL cases, 40 simultaneous contact lens cases, and 38 varifocal spectacle cases were evaluated. Other than CPS reading speed, all near visual acuity and reading metrics correlated well with each other (r> 0. 70, P<. 001). Near visual acuity measured with uppercase letters was highly concordant (ICC, 0. 78) and in close agreement with lowercase letters (+/- 0. 17 logMAR). Near word acuity agreed well with reading acuity (+/- 0. 16 logMAR), which in turn agreed well with near visual acuity measured with uppercase letters 0. 16 logMAR). Concordance (ICC, 0. 18 to 0. 46) and agreement (+/- 0. 24 to 0. 30 logMAR) of CPS with the other near metrics was moderate. CONCLUSION: Measurement of near visual ability in presbyopia should be standardized to include assessment of near visual acuity with logMAR uppercase-letter optotypes, smallest logMAR print size that maintains maximum reading speed (CPS), and reading speed.
