5000|$|Roadhog, {{real name}} Mako Rutledge, is Junkrat's {{enforcer}} and bodyguard of unknown nationality. He wields a Scrap Gun that fires shrapnel in a mid-range automatic firing mode, or a short-range shotgun-like single shot. He also carries a NOS canister filled with [...] "Hogdrogen" [...] to self-heal (Take a Breather), and employs a <b>Chain</b> <b>Hook</b> to pull distant opponents towards him. His ultimate ability, Whole Hog, {{allows him to}} put a top loader into his scrap gun, firing it in full auto mode with increased knockback, wider spread, and no need to reload.|$|E
50|$|Flinthook is {{an action}} platformer, roguelike {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} a masked space pirate who explores procedurally generated ships for treasure with a grappling <b>chain</b> <b>hook.</b> Captain Flinthook, the player-character, also has a plasma gun {{and the ability to}} slow time. The hook is used on environmental elements as well as enemies. For example, some enemies are invulnerable until the player removes their armor via the hook. The player uses the left analog stick to both control the player and aim the hook. The hook is activated via the controller's trigger, and face buttons make the character jump, shoot, throw bombs and interact with nearby objects. The game's level design and room contents are randomly generated, such that a room might look familiar but contain different enemies. The player unlocks different bounties to hunt down, and must start a chapter over from the beginning upon their character's death. The game is depicted in pixel art.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{places in}} North America, length is {{commonly}} 48 feet or 53 feet, and width is either 96 or 102 inches (including rub rails and stake pockets on the sides, which generally placed every 2 feet). Some older trailers still in service are only 45 feet or shorter if used in sets of doubles or triples (often used to haul hay). Various lengths and combination setups {{can only be}} legally driven on turnpike/toll roads which are far too long for most roadways. Body and frame {{can be one of}} 3 general designs: the heaviest and sturdiest is all steel (usually with wood planks), Ever popular combo with steel frame and aluminium bed, these type often have wood portions for nailing down dunnage boards), and aluminium (which is the lightest allowing for more cargo to be legally carried without overweight permits). Incredibly light and very expensive to purchase, all aluminium trailers are very slippery when wet, flex more and are easily damaged. They also have a natural upwards bend so that when loaded they straighten out to be more flat, rather than to sag in the middle under a load. Another popular type of flatbed trailer is a stepdeck (or drop deck) with approximately 2 feet lower deck and low profile wheels to accommodate taller loads, without hitting low bridges or tunnels. These stepdecks can come with loading ramps to allow vehicles to roll on and off of the back from ground level. Shorter trailers used for local jobs such as landscaping and building material delivery within urban or local areas can have a [...] "hitchhiker" [...] type forklift truck attached to the back in order for driver alone to deliver and unload pallet/skid items. A bulkhead or [...] "headache rack" [...] is sometimes be attached to the front of either a straight or a stepdeck trailer for load securement {{at the front of the}} deck. In the event of long pipes or steel or lumber coming loose in a hard braking incident, they save the operator and cab/sleeper in one of two manners in theory. If attached to the trailer they bend while attempting to block forward motion of a loosened cargo, causing the long load to go above the cab and driver. If attached to the frame behind the cab or sleeper of the tractor, in theory they protect the back of the cab from impact and if unable to stop the load coming thru the cab, they cause the cab to be knocked off of.the frame, rather than impale the cab and kill or seriously injure the driver.48 and 53 ft lengths usually have two axles spread out to over 10 ft apart at the rear [...] "California spread" [...] in order to allow for more weight distribution on the rear of the deck (40,000 lb instead of 34,000 for a tandem axles design). So-called Cali spread was originally designed to comply with bridge weight formulas in that state but has since been adopted in most other parts of the country. These spread axles take far wider turning radius, and if turning the combination tractor/trailer too sharply, the front axle tires of the trailer may damage the road/parking lot surface, or pop a tire bead off of the rim, or both. Some trailers have the capability of lifting or lowering the front axle independently to mitigate this risk, however driver may not be able to use this feature if the trailer is loaded, but if the deck is empty the driver can lower the front axle to bring the rear axle off of the ground to significantly decrease turning radius of the rig for easy manoeuvre in tight spaces, or to reduce tire wear during empty /deadhead miles of travel. Under the deck of the trailer can be attached racks for spare tires, dunnage boards, or tire chains...as well as various tool/storage boxes. On one side (or often both sides for alternating pull on strap tension) are usually sliding (but sometimes fixed) winches to ratchet down 4 inch straps for load securement. On most 48 foot trailers, you may not place these strap/winches over a tire as when air pressure releases out of the suspension system when parked, the deck lowers down and will likely pop a trailer tire. Some trailers have an air scale which when the driver learns how to interpret properly through experience, combined with his knowledge of how much his/her rig weighs when empty and can interpret how much cargo can safely and legally be loaded onto the trailer. With different varying loads of cargo, driver can have an idea how much his gross total weight is (and if he is legal to avoid ticket) (80,000 without a permit in most states, but slightly lower in others). Some decks have pop up chain systems which have a higher WLL (working load limit) than attaching chains to either the stake pocket/spools, or the frame. Other decks of trailers can have sliding detachable accessories which greatly diversify your options of where and how to place a <b>chain</b> <b>hook</b> for securement. Besides axles which raise/lower as needed, some spread axle trailers can slide one or both axles forward, or back to create a tandem setup in specific situations when necessary, to comply with weight distribution requirements. Although certain amounts of front and rear cargo overhang is allowed (as well as overhang to one or both sides of the trailer) with flags/banners/flashing lights to warn drivers behind and to the side of you of impending danger of impalement if they follow too close behind you and you should have to suddenly stop...in extreme cases permit loads require escort be led front rear or both for oversize/over dimension cargo/equipment.|$|E

40|$|We have {{determined}} the 2. 3 -Å-resolution crystal {{structure of a}} myosin light chain domain, corresponding to one type found in sea scallop catch (“smooth”) muscle. This structure reveals hinges that may function in the “on” and “off” states of myosin. The molecule adopts two different conformations about the heavy chain “hook” and regulatory light chain (RLC) helix D. This conformational change results in extended and compressed forms of the lever arm whose lengths differ by 10  Å. The heavy <b>chain</b> <b>hook</b> and RLC helix D hinges could thus serve as a potential major and localized source of cross-bridge compliance during the contractile cycle. In addition, {{in one of the}} molecules of the crystal, part of the RLC N-terminal extension is seen in atomic detail and forms a one-turn alpha-helix that interacts with RLC helix D. This extension, whose sequence is highly variable in different myosins, may thus modulate the flexibility of the lever arm. Moreover, the relative proximity of the phosphorylation site to the helix D hinge suggests a potential role for conformational changes about this hinge in the transition between the on and off states of regulated myosins...|$|E
2500|$|The next {{match was}} billed as a [...] "SmackDown! versus Raw Interpromotional match". Raw's The Great Khali faced SmackDown!'s Kane. It was a short match, but {{contained}} a notable spot. In homage to Hulk Hogan slamming André the Giant twenty years earlier at WrestleMania III, Kane picked up Khali {{for the first time}} and body-slammed him to the mat. The match ended with Khali pinning Kane after a Giant Chokeslam. After the match, Khali choked Kane out with Kane's <b>chained</b> <b>hook,</b> which was a reference to Kane's movie, See No Evil, where his character used said hook as a signature weapon.|$|R

50|$|The main entrance, at the {{intersection}} of the streets named Santa Fe and Sarmiento, was showcased by a magnificent set of brass gates framed by a portico with Corinthian columns. The lower façade of the palace is made of dark green granite from Germany. The upper floors feature more Corinthian columns and a loggia with statues. The top floor is crowned by a clock tower guarded by life-sized statues of Venus, Aphrodite and Apollo carved in Italian marble. Above the clock rises an 195-foot lightning rod made from Fuentes's own plow share.

30|$|First {{made during}} the {{overlapping}} Ayyubid (c. 1171 – 1260 C.E.) and Mamluk periods (c. 1250 – 1517 C.E.) in Egypt and the Levant, enameled glass mosque lamps have become {{closely associated with the}} history of Islamic art as presented in museums [1]. Carboni [1] describes a mosque lamp as “a lighting device made for a devotional building in the Islamic world, such as a mosque, a madrasa [religious school], a tomb or mausoleum, or a khanaqa [hostel].” However, the archaeological record and literary sources suggest that mosque lamps developed in domestic, rather than religious, contexts [1]. Mamluk mosque lamps usually {{take the form of a}} vase-shaped vessel with a flattened globular body and a wide, funnel-shaped neck. Two types of feet are common: either a flaring cone or a simple circular disk. Generally termed a “lamp,” these vessels actually functioned as “lampshades” that contained a smaller glass vessel, usually a saucer or tube, which held the oil and wick to light the lamp [1]. Suspended by long metal <b>chains</b> <b>hooked</b> to the vessels’ integral glass handles, these lamps hung from ceilings in their original architectural contexts.|$|R
50|$|The Type 97 is {{approximately}} 120 lb {{lighter than the}} Type 94 90-mm mortar. This weight saving was created largely by {{the elimination of the}} Type 94's recoil mechanism, which weighed 110 lb. The bipod assembly of the Type 97 is 14 lb lighter than that on the Type 94. There is a cover for the level on the yoke of the Type 97 which is not on the Type 94, and the sliding bracket of the Type 97 is hinged to permit its easy removal from the leg of the bipod, whereas it is integral on the Type 94.Certain compromises in material and workmanship were made in the manufacture of the Type 97. The bipod feet and <b>chain</b> <b>hooks</b> were held to the legs of the bipod by pins, joined with solder, whereas on the Type 94 they are welded. No welds were polished on the Type 97, although no indications of fractures were reported despite the poor quality of the welding. The adjusting nut, sliding bracket, and hand wheels of the Type 97 are made of steel, rather than brass which was utilized in the Type 94.|$|R
50|$|The typical {{method of}} {{utilizing}} an interrupt vector involves reading its present value (the address), storing {{it within the}} memory space of the TSR, and installing a pointer to its own code.
