5|$|The skins or {{heads of}} taiko are {{generally}} made from <b>cowhide</b> from Holstein cows aged {{about three or}} four years. Skins also come from horses, and bull skin is preferred for larger drums. Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins are used for larger ones. On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance. Before fitting it to the drum body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal. To stretch the skin over the drum properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several hydraulic jacks underneath it. The edges of the <b>cowhide</b> are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead. Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden dowels or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension. Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes. Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin has dried, tacks, called byō, are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; chū-daiko require about 300 of them for each side. After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{mounting}} system {{arose in the}} early seventies, when touring ballets {{came into contact with}} synthetic rope used by the military. Initially, the synthetic rope was used to replace the twisted <b>cowhide</b> strips. However, the rope could now be tightened {{to the point where it}} tore through the skin; in response, drum makers started using steel rings instead of twisted <b>cowhide</b> to hold the skin in place. Despite objections from many djembefolas, the modern {{mounting system}} gradually displaced the traditional one and, by 1991 had completely replaced it.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cowhide</b> {{is often}} used for lower-priced gloves. This leather is {{generally}} considered too thick and bulky {{for the majority of}} glove styles, particularly finer dress gloves. It is, however, used for some casual styles of glove.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, {{the most common}} {{mounting}} system used twisted strips of <b>cowhide</b> as rope. The skin was attached with rings made of cowhide; one ring was sown into {{the perimeter of the}} skin and a second ring placed below it, with loops holding the skin in place and securing the two rings together. A long strip of <b>cowhide</b> was used to lace up the drum, applying tension between the top ring and a third ring placed around the stem. To apply further tension, the vertical sections of the rope were woven into a diamond pattern that shortens the verticals. Wooden pegs wedged between the shell and the lacing could be used to increase tension still further.|$|E
25|$|Woolies are a {{variation}} on shotgun chaps, made with a fleece or with hair-on <b>cowhide,</b> often angora, lined with canvas on the inside. They are the warmest chaps, associated with the northern plains and Rocky Mountains. They appeared on the Great Plains somewhere around 1887.|$|E

25|$|Holsters {{supplied}} with the Hamada type pistol were usually made of <b>cowhide</b> leather and contained black metal closure fasteners. Because the Hamada pistol has a long, nine cartridge magazine, the holster of similar weapons like the Browning Model 1910 will not properly contain the Hamada pistol.|$|E
25|$|The most {{expensive}} full-length gloves are custom-made of kidskin. Many {{other types of}} leather, most usually soft varieties of <b>cowhide,</b> are used in making full-length gloves; patent leather and suede are especially popular as alternatives to kidskin, and are often more affordable than kidskin. Satin and stretch satin materials are extremely popular, and there are mass-produced varieties as well.|$|E
50|$|Cattle ranches, or ranchos, {{emerged as}} the {{dominant}} institutions of Mexican California. After Mexican independence from Spain, the chain of missions became {{the property of the}} Mexican government and were secularized by 1834. The ranchos developed under ownership by Californios (Spanish-speaking Californians) who had received land grants, and traded <b>cowhides</b> and tallow with Boston merchants.|$|R

25|$|Most Zulu warriors {{were armed}} with an assegai (short spear) and a shield made of <b>cowhide.</b> The Zulu army drilled in the {{personal}} and tactical use and coordination of this weapon. Some Zulus also had old muskets and antiquated rifles, though their marksmanship training was poor, and the quality and supply of powder and shot was dreadful.|$|E
25|$|The maguari stork {{has also}} been {{observed}} to uplift cowhides in dry fields in search of potential invertebrate prey underneath. This occurs especially in the non-breeding season when large migratory flocks search for arthropods in the bushes and dry short grass. Some individuals also sometimes eat pieces of cow dung. Historically, one individual has been observed to swallow a <b>cowhide</b> whole.|$|E
25|$|Cowboy {{boots are}} a {{specific}} style of riding boot which combines function with fashion. They became popular among cowboys {{in the western}} United States during the 19th century. Traditional cowboy boots have a Cuban heel, rounded to pointed toe, high shaft, and, traditionally, no lacing. They are normally made from <b>cowhide</b> leather but may be made from more exotic skins such as ostrich, anaconda, or elephant skins.|$|E

25|$|Abu Bakr was {{commissioned}} by Muhammad to lead the attack against Ta'if. From Autas the Muslim forces set out for Ta'if. The tribes shut themselves in the fort and refused {{to come out in}} the open. The Muslim employed catapults to throw stones in the town, but this did not lead to any tangible results. The Muslim tried the testudo device whereunder a group of soldiers shielded by a cover of <b>cowhide</b> advanced to set fire to the gate. The enemy threw red hot scraps of iron on the testudo which made it ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Christmas Festival traditions {{include both}} music and dance, {{especially}} related to masquerades and iron bands. The highland fling {{is a common}} Christmas Festival dance, also played in the modern Carnival, performed by people wearing Scottish kilts, masks made of wire and bearing whips of <b>cowhide.</b> Dancers wearing banana leaves and animal horns {{took part in the}} John Bull, while carolers paraded with long poles covered in lanterns, called carol trees, singing with accompaniment by the concertina. Stilt dancers in robes, called the Moko jumbie, Jumpa-Ben or Long Ghosts, were also common, and were accompanied by kettle and bass drums, fife, triangle (cling-a-ching) and the boompipe, made from a plumbing joint one meter long.|$|E
50|$|Many Maasai in Tanzania wear simple sandals, {{which were}} until {{recently}} made from <b>cowhides.</b> They are now soled with tire strips or plastic. Both {{men and women}} wear wooden bracelets. The Maasai women regularly weave and bead jewellery. This bead work plays an essential part in the ornamentation of their body. Although there are variations in {{the meaning of the}} color of the beads, some general meanings for a few colors are: white, peace; blue, water; red, warrior/blood/bravery.|$|R
50|$|Its use went {{in decline}} when {{firearms}} {{were introduced to}} hostilities. When lions and leopards were exterminated by firearms, it also lost its usefulness in hunting. By 1835 {{it is said to}} have been discarded by the Xhosa in their conflicts with Europeans. Baines (1851, 1852) and Weitz (1873) however observed their use among the Mpondo many years later. By the 1870s the Zulus were exporting large quantities of <b>cowhides</b> to obtain firearms and this also decreased the supply.|$|R
25|$|Timber wasn't {{the only}} product {{taken from the}} mountainsides and sent down the valley. Tanners brought up <b>cowhides</b> via those routes to treat in water boiled in hemlock bark, and {{charcoal}} kilns were more numerous in the Esopus Valley {{than anywhere else in}} the Catskills. Bluestone for city sidewalks and buildings was also quarried out of the hills. These industries had a deleterious effect on the creek at the center of the valley, adding eroded soil and pollutants to it.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{shoes are}} sandals dating from approximately 7000 or 8000 BC, {{found in the}} Fort Rock Cave in the US state of Oregon in 1938. The world's oldest leather shoe, made from {{a single piece of}} <b>cowhide</b> laced with a leather cord along seams at the front and back, was found in the Areni-1 cave complex in Armenia in 2008 and is believed to date to 3500 BC. Ötzi the Iceman's shoes, dating to 3300 BC, featured brown bearskin bases, deerskin side panels, and a bark-string net, which pulled tight around the foot. The Jotunheimen shoe was discovered in August 2006. Archaeologists estimate that the leather shoe was made between 1800 and 1100 BC, making it the oldest article of clothing discovered in Scandinavia.|$|E
25|$|The {{collected}} {{juice is}} placed into 50-liter barrels and carried {{from the field}} to the fermentation vats. These vats, called tinas, are located in a special building called a tinacal. This word derives from Spanish tina and Nahuatl calli that means house of vats. When pulque haciendas reached their peak in the late 19th century, hacienda life revolved around these tinacals. It typically was a rectangular shed of stone with a wooden roof. The upper parts of the walls opened for air circulation and the façades were sometimes decorated with indigenous designs or other images associated with the making of pulque. One popular motif was the discovery of pulque by Xochitl. Other popular elements were {{the images of the}} hacienda's patron saint and the Virgin of Guadalupe. Inside were the vats, which were <b>cowhide</b> stretched over wooden frames lined up against the walls. In larger tinacals, there were three or four rows of vats. Today, the tinas are made of oak, plastic or fiberglass and hold about 1,000 liters each.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, Samhain {{was a time}} to {{take stock}} of the herds and food supplies. Cattle were brought down to the winter {{pastures}} after six months in the higher summer pastures. It was also the time to choose which animals would need to be slaughtered for the winter. This custom is still observed by many who farm and raise livestock because it is when meat will keep since the freeze has come and also since summer grass is gone and free foraging is no longer possible. It is thought that some of the rituals associated with the slaughter have been transferred to other winter holidays. On St. Martin's Day (11 November) in Ireland, an animal – usually a rooster, goose or sheep – would be slaughtered and some of its blood sprinkled on the threshold of the house. It was offered to Saint Martin, who may have taken the place of a god or gods, and it was then eaten as part of a feast. This custom was common in parts of Ireland until the 19th century, and was found in some other parts of Europe. At New Year in the Hebrides, a man dressed in a <b>cowhide</b> would circle the township sunwise. A bit of the hide would be burnt and everyone would breathe in the smoke. These customs were meant to keep away bad luck, and similar customs were found in other Celtic regions.|$|E

A database of slave voyages by Liverpool-based vessels shows Kitty Amelia, Nuttall, master, sailing to Cuba, though it does not specify where she gathered her human cargo. Kitty's Amelia was back in Liverpool by October, having returned from Havana with a cargo of sugar, <b>cowhides,</b> and cotton.|$|R
