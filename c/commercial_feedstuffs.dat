40|$|It was of {{importance}} {{in the evaluation of}} feedingstufrs to know its quantitative composition. A qualitative botanical indicated purity but a quantitative test was needed for the degree of purity. Natural feedstuffs always contained a certain amount of foreign material, which could be considered either as natural or chance contamination. The manufacturer had to ensure that <b>commercial</b> <b>feedstuffs</b> had a high degree of purity. Whenever there was consideration in the trade of standards for purity, it was necessary to be able to check these standards. Ezendam worked out a method of measuring impurities both quantitatively and qualitatively. It was tested on some feedstuffs and thus led the way for microscopic study of feedingstuffs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In Serbia, <b>commercial</b> <b>feedstuffs</b> are an {{important}} component in modern animal husbandry, {{but there is no}} information available about fungal contaminataion. Because of that the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the mycoflora incidence in poultry feeds. A total of 230 samples of poultry feeds were examined for total fungi count and the presence of potential toxigenic fungi genera. Total fungi count were 1 - 9 x 10 4 CFU g- 1 in the most of investigated poultry feed samples (38. 26 %). The most prevalent fungi genera were Fusarium (56. 09 %) and Aspergillus (54. 35 %), followed by Rhizopus (40 %), Penicillium (30. 87 %), Mucor (30. 04 %) and the least frequency species were from genus Alternaria (3. 48 %). Key words: poultry feed, total fungi count, toxigenic fungi genera...|$|E
40|$|Intensification of milk {{production}} {{is associated with}} {{an increase in the number}} of dairy cows and milk yielding. In order to maintain high milk yield and quality of the produced raw material it is very important to adjust the appropriately balanced dose of feeds. Production of good quality own roughage is a valuable and cheap source of food for animals, but it may be insufficient to provide high milk yielding. As a result, it is necessary to buy commercial concentrated feedingstuffs (mainly protein concentrates and concentrated compounds) which may lead to an increase of production costs. Intensification of {{milk production}} in the economic aspect is justified only in the case of a simultaneous increase in the profitability of this production, which is the relation of the production value and incurred costs. For the economic purpose of milk production the way of feeding the dairy cows should also result from economic calculation and the purchase of commercial feedingstuffs must be economically justified. This article attempts to answer the question whether the increased consumption of commercial concentrated feedingstuffs and increased direct costs are justified by achieved economic results from milk production. The accountancy data were collected according to the methodology of the AGROKOSZTY and Polish FADN system among dairy farms. Grouping of the surveyed farms concerned a level of commercial feedingstuff quantity which (as shown by statistical analysis) was strongly correlated with milk yielding. The designated groups (with small level and high level of usage of commercial feedingstuffs) were analysed in terms of direct costs and labour input as well as the level of income from the activity. The economic results of the surveyed farms showed that the higher costs incurred for the purchase of <b>commercial</b> <b>feedstuffs</b> in the group with high usage of commercial feedingstuffs (average herd in the group was 30 dairy cows with milk yielding of 6, 000 liters per cow) did not allow to achieve much better economic results than in the group with small usage of <b>commercial</b> <b>feedstuffs</b> (average herd in group was 15 cows with milk yielding of 5, 200 litres per cow) ...|$|E
40|$|The chain-breaking of bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) spread between ruminant species and from bovine to humans has been performed by the ban on ruminant-derived proteins in ruminant feeds. The necessity to evaluate the fraudolent use of rendered protein supplements leads to new and more sensitive analytical methods. Bovine mithocondrial DNA {{seems to be a}} good marker for this purpose and the polymerase chain reaction leads to an in vitro amplification of a specific target DNA sequence. In this study we could detect up to 0. 0625 % of bovine-derived material scattered in a <b>commercial</b> <b>feedstuff.</b> The DNA extraction method used is effective also on different kinds of foods wich have been subjected to high temperature (canned meat) or long ripening time such as Parmesan cheese...|$|R
40|$|Twenty four male pigs were {{assigned}} to two groups of 12 each during the last fattening phase: one group was reared outdoor (OUT group) and fed on natural pasture, while the other group was reared indoor (IND group) and fed on <b>commercial</b> <b>feedstuff.</b> Meat was processed into Soppressata salami according to traditional protocol. Meat and Soppressata salami were analyzed for nutri-tional, textural and color parameters. Meat and Soppressata salami showed significantly higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in OUT than that in IND group. Ameliorated nutritional in-dexes in terms of n- 6 /n- 3 ratio, and thrombogenic index were found both in meat and Soppressata salami in OUT group. Texture Profile Analysis showed lower values in the tested samples from OUT than IND group. Lightness, redness, and chroma parameters were higher both in meat and Soppressata salami in OUT group; whereas hue parameter was lower in Soppressata salami from OUT pigs. Outdoor rearing improved fatty acid profile, nutritional indexes, color and mechanical properties of pork meat thanks to natural pasture, greater space allowance and physical exercise of animal during the fattening phase. Meat features strictly affected {{the quality of the}} Soppressat...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of pasture in oak and chestnut groves on the chemical and sensorial traits of cured lard. Thirty Cinta Senese barrows (124 kg of l. w. on average) were allotted to three groups: one group (CONC) was reared outdoors in a confined area and fed <b>commercial</b> <b>feedstuff.</b> The other two groups were raised under free-range conditions on acorns (AC) or chestnuts (CH). At slaughtering (148 kg of LW) the backfat was seasoned for 60 days to obtained cured lard. Results demonstrated that the lard of CH and AC respect to CONC group was the richest in MUFA (46. 9 and 47. 76 vs 44. 78 % respectively) because of the higher content of oleic acid (44. 2 and 44. 91 vs 42. 05 %, P< 0. 05, respectively). CH showed a higher percentage of PUFA-n 3 than AC and CONC (1. 18 vs 1. 06 and 1. 03 %, P< 0. 05, respectively), a lower content of α-tocopherol (9. 77 vs 14. 46 and 13. 31 μ/g, P< 0. 05 respectively) and a higher content of γ-tocopherol (13. 73 vs 6. 02 and 4. 32 μ/g, P< 0. 05, respectively). As regards sensorial traits, the lard of CH and AC groups exhibited a lower value of pinkness than CONC (29. 3 and 32. 4 vs 49. 2, P< 0. 05, respectively) and higher scores of yellowness (31. 4 and 28. 6 vs 18. 6, P< 0. 05, respectively) and oiliness (37. 0 and 33. 7 vs 24. 0, P< 0. 05, respectively). The pasture in the acorn and chestnut groves affected the chemical traits of lard, prevalently the composition of fatty acids. The consumption of acorns or chestnuts led to a higher content of oleic acid with respect to concentrate, affecting some sensorial traits of lard...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{samples of}} two <b>commercial</b> <b>feedstuffs,</b> one for {{fattening}} pigs {{and one for}} pregnant sows, half of them containing hammer-mill ground corn {{and the other half}} containing roller-mill ground corn, were analyzed under laboratory conditions to determine the effect of milled corn, as the main ingredient in swine diets, on the mean particle size, standard deviation, apparent density, and stability ratio of emitted dust. Higher levels of respirable dust were recorded from roller-milled diets than from hammer-milled diets. Persistently high dust concentrations were recorded throughout the period of observation for both mixtures of roller-milled feedstuffs, particularly the pregnant sow diet, which was characterized by high corn percentages. The type of formulation influenced the mean particle size, standard deviation, and apparent density. The type of corn milling significantly influenced mean particle size, standard deviation, and feedstuff stability. It can be concluded that although roller-milling of corn can {{have a positive effect on}} feed digestibility, as widely reported in the literature, large amounts included in the diet can reduce the quality of air inside piggeries, with higher levels of fine particulate matter. status: publishe...|$|E
