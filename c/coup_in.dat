5|$|By the 1980s, {{the bank}} had {{undertaken}} a major push into the securities business internationally. The bank established a position as a leading European underwriter of Eurobonds and pulled off a major <b>coup</b> <b>in</b> 1985 by pricing a large bond offering for Nestlé, Rockwell, IBM, and Mobil at below market rates.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, a <b>coup</b> <b>in</b> Lisbon caused {{significant}} changes in Portugal's relationship to its colony in Timor. The power shift in Europe invigorated movements for independence in colonies like Mozambique and Angola, and the new Portuguese government began a decolonisation process for East Timor. The first of these was an opening of the political process.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} three East Bosnian Shock Battalions, the Partisan General Staff of Bosnia-Herzegovina first {{attempted}} to cross the Bosna to follow the Partisan Supreme Headquarters and main force to western Bosnia, but instead retreated to Birač, where they joined forces with the Birač Detachment {{at the end of}} May. The Birač Partisan Detachment was the only Partisan or volunteer detachment in East Bosnia not to suffer a pro-Chetnik <b>coup</b> <b>in</b> March–May 1942. By June–July 1942, the Partisans in eastern Bosnia had been reduced to a strength of around 600 fighters.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>coup</b> <b>in</b> June 1966, the {{so-called}} Argentine Revolution, brought Juan Carlos Onganía to power. Ongania appointed Adalbert Krieger Vasena {{to head the}} Economy Ministry. His strategy implied a very active role for the public sector in guiding the process of economic growth, calling for state control over the money supply, wages and prices, and bank credit to the private sector.|$|E

50|$|The Minister for Foreign Affairs (commonly {{known as}} the Foreign Minister) is Fiji's Cabinet Minister {{responsible}} for foreign relations and diplomacy and oversees its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. Especially since two military <b>coups</b> <b>in</b> 1987 harmed Fiji's relationship with other countries, with two more <b>coups</b> <b>in</b> 2000 and 2006 respectively, the Foreign Minister's position {{has been a very}} important one.|$|R
5|$|By 1991, most Armenians from Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis from Armenia {{were forced}} to move to their {{respective}} countries, as remaining in their homes became nearly impossible. Although Armenia had proclaimed its independence from the Soviet Union on 23 August 1990, {{it was not until}} on 21 September 1991, a month after the failed August <b>Coup</b> <b>in</b> Moscow, when the overwhelming majority of Armenians voted for the independence in a nationwide referendum. Levon Ter-Petrosyan, the leader of the Karabakh Committee {{and the head of the}} Supreme Council since 1990, was elected president of Armenia in October.|$|E
5|$|Despite legal provisions, {{media freedom}} in Turkey has {{steadily}} deteriorated from 2010 onwards, with a precipitous decline following the attempted <b>coup</b> <b>in</b> July 2016.

Ranking 1st in the world, {{all of them}} facing anti-state charges, {{in the wake of}} an unprecedented crackdown that has included the shuttering of more than 100 news outlets. Freedom House lists Turkey's media as not free. The media crackdowns also extend to Internet censorship with Wikipedia getting blocked since April 2017.|$|E
5|$|During David Dacko's {{presidency}} from 1960 to 1966, {{there was}} {{a significant increase in the}} production of diamonds. This occurred when the monopoly of the French concessionary companies was ended with a law allowing local citizens to dig for diamonds. After Dacko set up a diamond cutting factory at Bangui, diamonds became the country's leading export. But by the end of his five year's tenure, rampant corruption and financial indiscipline had resulted in workers being left unpaid and civil unrest ensued. Bokassa then seized power in a military <b>coup</b> <b>in</b> 1966.|$|E

5|$|During the mid-to-late 1960s Notosusanto wrote {{extensively}} on the military history of Indonesia, including a book on Supriyadi's anti-Japanese rebellion in 1945 and the Battle of Surabaya.

5|$|Following a <b>coup</b> <b>in</b> the Mexican government, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna became {{president}} and revoked many freedoms previously {{enjoyed by the}} Texans further deteriorating the government's relations with the region's settlers.

5|$|Led by Enver Pasha, a <b>coup</b> <b>in</b> Turkey in 1913 sidelined Sultan Mehmed V and {{concentrated}} {{power in the}} hands of a junta. Despite the secular nature of the new government, Turkey retained its traditional influence over the Muslim world. Turkey ruled Hejaz until the Arab Revolt of 1916 and controlled the Muslim holy city of Mecca throughout the war.

5|$|Operations in Borneo were {{extremely}} sensitive and they received little press coverage in Australia, while official acknowledgement {{of involvement in}} cross-border missions only occurred in 1996. Following a military <b>coup</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia in early 1966 which brought General Suharto to power, a peace treaty was signed in August 1966 which ended the conflict. 3,500 Australians served during Confrontation; casualties included 16 dead, with seven killed in action and eight wounded.|$|E
5|$|Smetona and Voldemaras, both {{representing}} the Lithuanian National Union, invited the Christian Democrats {{to join them}} in forming a new government that would restore some degree of constitutional legitimacy. The party agreed reluctantly; {{they were worried about}} their prestige. Looking toward the near future, the Christian Democrats reasoned that they could easily win any upcoming Seimas elections, regaining power by constitutional means and avoiding direct association with the <b>coup.</b> <b>In</b> keeping with this strategy, they allowed members of the Lithuanian National Union to take over the most prominent posts.|$|E

5|$|The Secretariat {{organised}} a Fifth World Congress in October 1957.

5|$|This {{same period}} saw Royal Oak star {{alongside}} fourteen other Royal Navy {{vessels in the}} 1937 British film melodrama Our Fighting Navy, the plot of which centres around a <b>coup</b> <b>in</b> the fictional South American republic of Bianco.

The film was poorly received by critics, but gained some redemption through its dramatic scenes of naval action.|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} {{an explanation for}} the significant variation <b>in</b> <b>coups</b> <b>in</b> autocracies. The existing theoretical literature focuses on the strategies that leaders use to thwart mass mobilization and survive in power. However, most autocratic leaders lose power through a coup, indicating that the main threats to political survival in autocracies emerge from insiders and not from outside the incumbent coalition. This article focuses on leaders’ strategies to mitigate elite threats and argues that autocrats’ strategies of co-optation and repression within the ruling elite and the armed forces affect the risk of <b>coups</b> <b>in</b> opposite ways. Elected authoritarian legislatures are instruments that leaders employ to co-opt members of the incumbent coalition and are expected to decrease the likelihood of <b>coups.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, purges of insider actors constitute a repressive strategy that depletes bases of support and increases the risk of coups. We find empirical support for these hypotheses from a sample of all authoritarian regimes from 1950 to 2004. ...|$|R
