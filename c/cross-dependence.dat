40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating time-localized <b>cross-dependence</b> {{in a collection of}} nonstationary signals. To this end, we develop the multivariate locally stationary wavelet framework, which provides a time-scale decomposition of the signals and, thus, naturally captures the time-evolving scale-specific <b>cross-dependence</b> between components of the signals. Under the proposed model, we rigorously define and estimate two forms of <b>cross-dependence</b> measures: wavelet coherence and wavelet partial coherence. These dependence measures differ in a subtle but important way. The former is a broad measure of dependence, which may include indirect associations, i. e., dependence between a pair of signals that is driven by another signal. Conversely, wavelet partial coherence measures direct linear association between a pair of signals, i. e., it removes the linear effect of other observed signals. Our time-scale wavelet partial coherence estimation scheme thus provides a mechanism for identifying hidden dynamic relationships within a network of nonstationary signals, as we demonstrate on electroencephalograms recorded in a visual–motor experiment...|$|E
40|$|Transport of passive, {{dissolved}} {{compounds in}} fully-saturated complex porous media frequently exhibits non-Fickian characteristics. One {{of the most}} interesting questions is to ascertain the time scales at which it is possible to describe transport as a statistically independent process. Therefore we study the mechanisms for evolution and then the decrease of non-Fickianity as a function of increasing time. Adopting the Lagrangian perspective, we provide a non-linear copula analysis of advective-diffusive processes by analyzing particle trajectories in a real porous media, as provided by direct numerical simulations on the three-dimensional image of Doddington sandstone. First, we analyze the memory effects between time-consecutive particle position increments and <b>cross-dependence</b> between longitudinal and transver sal particle position increments as a function of given time increments and time lags between consecutive time increments. Second, we investigate the influence of the P´eclet regime on the temporal evolution of dependence. Our main findings are: (a) <b>Cross-dependence</b> between longitudinal and transver sal particle position increments is persistent over the investigated range of time increments, even though this aspect has been neglected up to date. (b) Lower P´eclet numbers lead to a weaker dependence that is, however, more persistent over time than in higher-P´eclet transport regimes. We confirm that non-Fickianity comes from spatial coherence associated with heterogeneities of the velocity field that introduce <b>cross-dependence</b> and memory into the transport process. Overall, we show that memory and <b>cross-dependence</b> are persistent in and among all directions, that the dependence is highly-nonlinear, occurs at different temporal scales, and is dependent on the P´eclet number...|$|E
40|$|Coherence is {{one common}} metric for <b>cross-dependence</b> between {{components}} in multivariate time series. However, standard coherence does not sufficiently model many biological signals with complex dependence {{structures such as}} interactions between low frequency oscillations and high frequency oscillations. The notion of low-high frequency <b>cross-dependence,</b> defined in classical harmonizable processes, assumes time-invariance and thus is still inadequate for modeling cross-frequency interactions that evolve over time. We construct a novel framework for modeling and estimating these dependencies under the replicated time series setting. Under this framework we establish the novel concept of evolutionary dual-frequency coherence and develop time-localized estimators based on dual-frequency lo- cal periodograms. The proposed non-parametric estimation procedure does not suffer from model misspecification. It uses the localized fast Fourier transform (FFT) and hence is able to handle massive data. When applied to electroencephalograms, the proposed method uncovers interesting cross- oscillatory interactions that are neglected by the standard approaches...|$|E

40|$|Many spatial {{processes}} in environmental applications, such as climate variables and climate model errors {{on a global}} scale, exhibit complex nonstationary dependence structure, in not only their marginal covariance but also their cross-covariance. Flexible cross-covariance models for processes {{on a global scale}} are critical for an accurate description of each spatial process as well as the <b>cross-dependences</b> between them and also for improved predictions. We propose various ways to produce cross-covariance models, based on the Matérn covariance model class, that are suitable for describing prominent nonstationary characteristics of the global processes. In particular, we seek nonstationary versions of Matérn covariance models whose smoothness parameters vary over space, coupled with a differential operators approach for modeling large-scale nonstationarity. We compare their performance to the performance of some existing models in terms of the aic and spatial predictions in two applications: joint modeling of surface temperature and precipitation, and joint modeling of errors in climate model ensembles. © 2014 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{empirical}} characteristic functions for inference problems, including estimation in some special parametric settings and testing for goodness of fit, {{has a long}} history dating back to the 70 s (see for example, Feuerverger and Mureika (1977), Csorgo (1981 a, 1981 b, 1981 c), Feuerverger (1993)). More recently, there has been renewed interest in using empirical characteristic functions in other inference settings. The distance covariance and correlation, developed by Szekely and Rizzo (2009) for measuring dependence and testing independence between two random vectors, are perhaps the best known illustrations of this. We apply these ideas to stationary univariate and multivariate time series to measure lagged auto- and <b>cross-dependence</b> in a time series. Assuming strong mixing, we establish the relevant asymptotic theory for the sample auto- and cross-distance correlation functions. We also apply the auto-distance correlation function (ADCF) to the residuals of an autoregressive processes as a test of goodness of fit. Under the null that an autoregressive model is true, the limit distribution of the empirical ADCF can differ markedly from the corresponding one based on an iid sequence. We illustrate the use of the empirical auto- and cross-distance correlation functions for testing dependence and <b>cross-dependence</b> of time series in a variety of different contexts.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the empirical relationship between carbon dioxide (CO²) emissions per-capita {{and economic growth}} in a panel of 20 Latin American and Caribbean countries over the period 1971 - 2011. This empirical relationship, known in the economic literature as the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, suggests {{that the relationship between}} these variables, in the long run, follows an inverse U-shape, that is, from a certain level of per-capita income, an increased economic growth would be accompanied by improvements in environmental quality. Although this hypothesis has been studied since the 1990 s, its empirical validity has recently been questioned on the basis of, among other things, the lack of diagnosis of the stationarity properties of the variables, and in a panel data context, the presence of cross-sectional dependence. Taking into account both criticisms, we use recent unit root tests and cointegration techniques that are robust to the presence of cross-sectional dependence. We find contradictory results depending on the assumption of <b>cross-dependence.</b> Under the assumption of cross-independence, the existence of an EKC with a realistic turning point is confirmed. However, this assumption is subsequently rejected, and {{because of the presence of}} <b>cross-dependence</b> in the panel, a long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables cannot be established, and we reject the existence of an EKC...|$|E
40|$|Many {{geophysical}} data, such as {{the frequencies}} of the free oscillations of the Earth, depend {{on more than one}} type of model parameter. For inverse problems depending on multiple parameter classes, an iterative solution procedure is introduced in which each parameter class can be treated in the same way. This approach has considerable advantages where a large number of parameters are employed, but can still be useful for smaller systems. The iteration by parameter class commences by solving for the direct dependence on a particular parameter class, and at subsequent iterations the <b>cross-dependences</b> between classes are introduced. The update aVects only the right-hand side of the equations, and, because the same sets of equations have to be solved at each iteration, an eYcient computational implementation can be made. The largest set of equations that has to be solved at a time corresponds to the number of variables in an individual parameter class rather than the full set of parameters, which confers substantial computational benefits for very large problems.

40|$|In multivariate {{time series}} analysis, objects of primary {{interest}} to study <b>cross-dependences</b> in the time series are the autocovariance or spectral density matrices. Non-degenerate covariance and spectral density matrices are necessarily Hermitian and positive definite, and our primary goal is to develop new methods to analyze samples of such matrices. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} the generalization of the concept of statistical data depth for collections of covariance or spectral density matrices by exploiting the geometric properties of the space of Hermitian positive definite matrices as a Riemannian manifold. This allows one to naturally characterize most central or outlying matrices, but also provides a practical framework for rank-based hypothesis testing in the context of samples of covariance or spectral density matrices. First, the desired properties of a data depth function acting on the space of Hermitian positive definite matrices are presented. Second, we propose two computationally efficient pointwise and integrated data depth functions that satisfy each of these requirements. Several applications of the developed methodology are illustrated by the analysis of collections of spectral matrices in multivariate brain signal time series datasets...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—While {{correlation}} {{measures are}} used to discern statistical re-lationships between observed variables in almost all branches of data-driven scientific inquiry, what we are really interested in is the existence of causal dependence. Statistical tests for causality, it turns out, are signif-icantly harder to construct; the difficulty stemming from both philosophical hurdles in making precise the notion of causality, and the practical issue of obtaining an operational procedure from a philosophically sound definition. In particular, designing an efficient causality test, that may be {{carried out in the}} absence of restrictive pre-suppositions on the underlying dynamical structure of the data at hand, is non-trivial. Nevertheless, ability to computa-tionally infer statistical prima facie evidence of causal dependence may yield a far more discriminative tool for data analysis compared to the calculation of simple correlations. In the present work, we present a new non-parametric test of Granger causality for quantized or symbolic data streams generated by ergodic stationary sources. In contrast to state-of-art binary tests, our approach makes precise and computes the degree of causal dependence between data streams, without making any restrictive assumptions, linear-ity or otherwise. Additionally, without any a priori imposition of specific dynamical structure, we infer explicit generative models of causal <b>cross-dependence,</b> which may be then used for prediction.

40|$|Simultaneous {{information}} and power transfer (SWIPT) is characterised by the ambiguous role of multi-user interference. In short, the beneficial effect of multi-user interference on RF energy harvesting is obtained {{at the price}} of a reduced link capacity, thus originating nontrivial trade-offs between the achievable information rate and the harvestable energy. Arguably, in indoor environments, this trade-off might be affected by the propagation loss due to blockage objects like walls. Hence, a couple of fundamental questions arise. How much must the network elements be densified to counteract the blockage attenuation? Is blockage always detrimental on the achievable rate-energy trade-off? In this paper, we analyse the performance of an indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SWIPT-enabled network in the attempt to shed a light of those questions. The effects of the obstacles are examined {{with the help of a}} stochastic approach in which energy transmitters (also referred to as power heads) are located by using a Poisson Point Process and walls are generated through a Manhattan Poisson Line Process. The stochastic behaviour of the signal attenuation and the multi-user interference is studied to obtain the Joint Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (J-CCDF) of information rate and harvested power. Theoretical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Eventually, the rate-energy trade-off is presented as a function of the frequency of walls to emphasise the <b>cross-dependences</b> between the deployment of the network elements and the topology of the venue...|$|R

We present a new method allowing for an extensive and straightforward characterisation of the complex nature of such isotopologue remote sensing datasets. We demonstrate that the MUSICA humidity profiles are representative {{for most of the}} troposphere with a vertical resolution ranging from about 2 km (in the lower troposphere) to 8 km (in the upper troposphere) and with an estimated precision of better than 10 %. We find that the sensitivity with respect to the isotopologue composition is limited to the lower and middle troposphere, whereby we estimate a precision of about 30 &permil; for the ratio between the two isotopologues HD 16 O and H 2 16 O. The measurement noise, the applied atmospheric temperature profiles, the uncertainty in the spectral baseline, and the <b>cross-dependence</b> on humidity are the leading error sources.

Our findings are clearly supportive of regime-wise trend stationarity in output after (1) allowing for <b>cross-dependence</b> and multiple breaks, and (2) removing four countries that exert undue influence on the whole panel. Remarkably, our main results hold true for alternative per capita real GDP proxies retrieved from the Penn World Table 6. 2 as well as for different country-groups constructed {{on the basis of the}} country's participation in regional integration processes. Interestingly, the timing of the breaks broadly coincides with terms of trade shocks associated with large fluctuations in the price of primary commodities. Based on our results, we draw some policy prescriptions that point to the need for managing adequately terms of trade booms and busts to avoid large swings in Africa's aggregate output.

40|$|Abstract. Online {{news has}} become {{increasingly}} prevalent as it helps the public access timely information conveniently. Meanwhile, the rapid pro-liferation of Web 2. 0 applications has enabled the public to freely express opinions and comments over news (user-generated content, or UGC for short), making the current Web a highly interactive platform. Gener-ally, a particular event often brings forth two correlated streams from news agencies and the public, and previous work mainly focuses on the topic evolution in single or multiple streams. Studying the inter-stream influence poses a new research challenge. In this paper, we study the mutual influence between news and UGC streams (especially the UGC-to-news direction) through a novel three-phase framework. In particular, we first propose a <b>cross-dependence</b> temporal topic model (CDTTM) for topic extraction, then employ a hybrid method to discover {{short and long term}} influence links across streams, and finally introduce four measures to quantify how the unique topics from one stream affect or influence the generation of the other stream (e. g. UGC to news). Extensive exper-iments are conducted on five actual news datasets from Sina, New York Times and Twitter, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Furthermore, we observe that not only news triggers the generation of UGC, but also UGC conversely drives the news reports...|$|E
40|$|Droughts are an {{inevitable}} consequence of climate variability and are pervasive across many regions. Their effects can vary on an extensive scale, {{depending on the}} type of drought and people’s vulnerability. Crucial characteristics of both hydrological (groundwater, streamflow) and meteorological (precipitation) droughts are related to their durations and severities, and these characteristics are typically correlated. While many studies have addressed the dependencies between these characteristics for either the meteorological or hydrological drought, the <b>cross-dependence</b> between meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics is barely investigated. The development of meteorological drought characteristics to hydrological drought characteristics is often hard to model and their connection is not definitively established. In order to better understand and explain this relationship, this study seeks to apply statistical tools and models. Drought characteristics data from areas in Europe with different climates are analysed. Two approaches of identifying related meteorological and hydrological drought are explored and compared. Classical linear correlation techniques do not provide promising results, indicating that any statistic of a hydrological drought is not a straightforward function of a preceding meteorological drought. Subsequently, the application of the concept of copulas to explore this dependence between meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics is investigated. The more comprehensive approach of copulas shows that the meteorological drought contains probability information of the successive hydrological drought...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an {{approach}} to modeling high-dimensional networks {{with a large number}} of nodes arranged in a hierarchical and modular structure. We propose a novel multi-scale factor analysis (MSFA) model which partitions the massive spatio-temporal data defined over the complex networks into a finite set of regional clusters. To achieve further dimension reduction, we represent the signals in each cluster by a small number of latent factors. The correlation matrix for all nodes in the network are approximated by lower-dimensional sub-structures derived from the cluster-specific factors. To estimate regional connectivity between numerous nodes (within each cluster), we apply principal components analysis (PCA) to produce factors which are derived as the optimal reconstruction of the observed signals under the squared loss. Then, we estimate global connectivity (between clusters or sub-networks) based on the factors across regions using the RV-coefficient as the <b>cross-dependence</b> measure. This gives a reliable and computationally efficient multi-scale analysis of both regional and global dependencies of the large networks. The proposed novel approach is applied to estimate brain connectivity networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Results on resting-state fMRI reveal interesting modular and hierarchical organization of human brain networks during rest. Comment: 43 page...|$|E
