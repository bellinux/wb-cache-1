40|$|Research advancements in {{cardiology}} instrumentation {{and techniques}} are summarized. Emphasis is placed upon the following techniques: (1) development of electrodes which show good skin compatibility and wearer comfort; (2) <b>contourography</b> - a real time display system for showing {{the results of}} EKGs; (3) detection of arteriosclerosis by digital computer processing of X-ray photos; (4) automated, noninvasive systems for blood pressure measurement; (5) ultrasonoscope - a noninvasive device for use in diagnosis of aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valve disease; and (6) rechargable cardiac pacemakers. The formation of a biomedical applications team which is an interdisciplinary team {{to bridge the gap}} between the developers and users of technology is described...|$|E
40|$|Angiocardiography {{is defined}} as an X-ray {{procedure}} which uses an intravascularly injected contrast material for visualization of the internal anatomy {{of the heart and}} great vessels. Past and present efforts in angiocardiography technology and methodology are reviewed, with special emphasis on qualitative and quantitative measurements of heart and vessel geometry. One of the more recent applications of angiographic image analysis has been for pattern recognition of margin motions over a cardiac cycle, termed <b>contourography.</b> Angiocardiography will continue to serve, as it has served in the past, as the principal standard of reference for calibration and/or comparison of newer methods for determining volume or dimensional change, depending on further technologic advances in X-ray equipment and means for displaying computer-processed information...|$|E
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} <b>contourography</b> on sole at normal {{standing position}} is photographed by using moire topography method. Subjects are 40 male University students in good health. Though {{the length and}} breadth of right and left soles indicated similar values, the breadth and height of the nonimprinted portion of the right sole were larger than the left sole. The profile line in frontal dimension, which passes through the midpart of nonimprinted portion of sole, showed relatively larger individual differnces. A correlation matrix of 10 items from the sole were adopted to factor analysis. Three factors were extracted by means of principal factor method and the normal Varimax rotation. The factors were elucidated as (1) size of sole as a whole (2) breadth of nonimprinted portion in sole (3) height of nonimprinted portion in sole...|$|E
