50|$|<b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> is {{a species}} of marine ray-finned fish in the family Macrouridae. Its common names include the rock {{grenadier}}, the roundnose grenadier and the roundhead rat-tail. In France it is known as Grenadier de roche and in Spain as Granadero de roca. It is a large, deep water species and is fished commercially in the northern Atlantic Ocean.|$|R
5000|$|The {{common name}} and species epithet [...] "kaupii" [...] refer to naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. The Kaup's arrowtooth eel is preyed on by <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris.</b> Its own diet {{consists}} of benthic crustaceans including decapods and amphipods, planktonic crustaceans including euphausiids and mysids, cephalopods including species of Rossia, and bony fish including Macroramphosus scolopax. It {{is of no}} commercial interest to fisheries, but it is sometimes caught as by-catch by bottom longline and baited fish traps.|$|R
50|$|The macrourids form a {{large and}} diverse family with 28 extant genera {{recognized}} (well {{over half of the}} total species are contained in just three genera, Coelorinchus, Coryphaenoides, and Nezumia). They range in length from about 10 cm in Hymenogadus gracilis to 1.5 m in Albatrossia pectoralis. An important commercial fishery exists for the larger species, such as the giant grenadier and <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris.</b> The family as a whole may represent up to 15% of the deep-sea fish population.|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} primers for eight dinucleotide microsatellite loci in the marine deep sea fish, roundnose grenadier (<b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris).</b> All markers were obtained from a partial genomic DNA library, and characterized in 90 unrelated individuals from one putative population sampled on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The number of alleles ranged from two to 61 {{with an average of}} 21 per locus. The observed heterozygosity levels ranged from 0. 301 to 0. 987 with an average of 0. 672. Several of the markers amplified multiple alleles from either the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) or the deep-sea fish roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{variety of}} {{habitats}} {{and the large}} volume of plankton on the surface support prolific marine life. Energy moves from the top to the bottom according to Vinogradov's ladder of migrations; that is, some species are benthic and others pelagic, but there are graded marine layers within which species move vertically for short distances. In addition, some species are benthopelagic, moving between surface and bottom. The benthic species include <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris,</b> Argentina silus, Etmopterus spinax, Chimaera monstrosa and Glyptocephalus cynoglossus. On the top are Clupea harengus, Scomber scombrus, Sprattus sprattus. Some species that move between are Pandalus borealis, Sabinea sarsi, Etmopterus spinax.|$|R
40|$|Work {{on sound}} {{production}} of deep-sea fishes {{has been limited}} to anatomy, and no sounds from identified species have been recorded on the continental slope. Here I examined the sonic muscles of six species in the family Macrouridae by depth (Coelorhincus carminatus, Nezumia bairdii, <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris,</b> Nezumia equalis, <b>Coryphaenoides</b> armatus, Coryphaenoides carapinus,). Due to increasingly limited food with depth, I hypothesized that sonic muscle development would decrease with depth. Sonic muscles were intrinsic and occurred in males and females. Swimbladder and sonic muscle dimensions increased linearly with fish size, {{but there were no}} clear differences with depth suggesting sound production remains important in deeper species...|$|R
40|$|Length {{and weight}} {{information}} {{were obtained from}} roundnose grenadier (<b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> Gunn.) during research trawling in the areas off West Greenland and Baffin Island (Subareas 0 and 1), off northern Labrador (Div. 2 G) and off Notre Dame Bay (Div. 3 K) from 1968 to 1980. Comparisons by area and sex indicated some variability, possibly caused in part by differing habitat conditions. Relationships derived for grenadiers in Subarea 2 and Div. 3 K indicated general consistency between studies, while results from Subareas 0 and 1 were more variable. The results suggest {{that it may not}} be appropriate to utilize growth differences as indicators of differing stocks...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} the discard and by-catch {{composition of}} the Spanish fleet targeting Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) in NAFO divisions 3 LMNO. During 2008 and 2009 the sampling coverage of the fishing effort was 20. 6 % and 16. 5 %, respectively. Data showed a reduced (4. 3 % in weight) but highly variable discard rate. The main discarded species were the macrourids Macrourus berglax, <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> and Nezumia bairdi, together with other 2 fish species: Antimora rostrata and Amblyraja radiata. The target species (Greenland halibut) was intermittently discarded. The discard rate showed no pattern no trend. No significant catches of benthic invertebrate taxa indicators of vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) were recorded...|$|R
40|$|Ocean circulation, {{bathymetric}} barriers, {{and ecological}} processes can hinder the dispersal of marine fishes and thus generate sub-populations. The present {{study investigated the}} population structure of a benthopelagic fish, <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris,</b> from three Norwegian fjords and two coastal sites using eight microsatellite DNA markers. Genetic analyses revealed significant population genetic structure across the study area (FST = 0. 0297, P < 0. 001) and temporal stability in the Skagerrak. There was evidence of highly isolated sub-populations, as shown by significant pairwise differences in tests of genic differentiation and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), high inbreeding coefficients (FIS), high homozygosity, and low genetic diversity. Small-scale, within-fjord population structuring was also found in Lustrafjord. Mantel tests revealed a strong effect of isolation by distance and isolation by depth (bottom depth) and a possible effect of bottom temperature. Significant differences in fish condition were found between sites and included length-weight relationships (Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) : F = 8. 249, df = 7, P < 0. 001), Hepatosomatic Index (HSI; GLM: F = 252. 48, df = 3, P < 0. 001) and Gonadosomatic Index (GSI; GLM: F = 15. 91, df = 3, P < 0. 001). In conclusion, population structuring in C. rupestris along the Norwegian coast seems {{to be influenced by}} distance, bathymetric barriers like bottom depth and fjord sills, and differences in fish condition indicate possible differences in environmental conditions between sites. <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> is an overfished species that has been redlisted as critically endangered. Based on the present findings, stock management should consider each of the sub-populations independently, and not depend on recovery through recruitment from neighbouring sub-populations...|$|R
50|$|Because {{little was}} known about the {{biodiversity}} of the New England Seamount Chain, an expedition was mounted in 2000. The NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service deep water research vessel R/V Delaware II made 20 exploratory trawls {{in the vicinity of}} Bear Seamount and around 274 species were collected. These included 115 species of fish, some of which were rare or had not been recorded in the western North Atlantic before. The roundnose grenadier (<b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris)</b> and the onion-eye grenadier (Macrourus berglax) were the only fish species of potential commercial importance - they were caught in mid-water at depths of between 1100 and 1800 m and were up to a metre in length. A common but much smaller fish was Aldrovandia phalacra.|$|R
40|$|The Fisheries Research Centre (FRC) has {{conducted}} trawl and longline surveys in the Rockall Trough since 1993, fishing {{a total of}} 223 stations over the depth range 201 to 4, 945 m. Trawls produced greater species diversity and higher discard rates than longlines, which selected larger squalifurm sharks. In 1997, limited selectivity work, based on ten comparative tows, showed that the size range of roundnose grenadier (<b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris)</b> caught using a commercial trawl (llOmm), with and without a small mesh end liner (30 mm), were similar. This indicates that mesh size, because of poor selectivity and perceived low survival rates of escapees, {{may not be a}} useful management tool in the regulation of the trawl fishery. This article was originally published by ICES on their website [URL]...|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} 1987 – 94, 11 bottom trawl surveys {{covering}} depths from 34 to 1 497 m were conducted at West Greenland. Two grenadier species not previously recorded for the area, Nezumia bairdi and Gadomus longifils, were caught bringing {{the number of}} spe-cies recorded in West Greenland waters to ten. A significant amount of new information on grenadier species previously recorded was also collected during the surveys. Geographic distribution in relation to depth and temperature, abundance {{of the most common}} species, <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris,</b> <b>Coryphaenoides</b> güentheri and Macrourus berglax and length distributions of all species encountered were analyzed. Growth of C. rupestris and M. berglax, food of C. rupestris, M. berglax (in relation to time of the year and predator length), C. güentheri and Coryphaenoides brevibarbis, length/weight relationships for C. rupestris, C. güentheri and M. berglax are also presented. Further, relationships between total length and pre-anal fin length for Trachyrhynchus murrayi and all species mentioned above, ex-cept G. longifilis, and maturation of C. rupestris and C. güentheri are given. The available information about three grenadier species not observed during the surveys but previously recorded from the area, i. e. Nezumia aequalis, Coryphaenoides armatus and Coryphaenoides carapinus, is summarized...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Two fish species, {{the greater}} silver smelt Argentina silus and the roundnose {{grenadier}} <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris,</b> are highly abundant in the deep-water areas of the Skagerrak. Since the 1970 s, a small aimed trawl fishery for the smelt has developed and now also some grenadier is landed. The biology and general distribution of both species have been described from the Skagerrak and elsewhere. Due to their benthopelagic distribution at depths from 200 to 700 m, previous attempts at estimating abundance and biomass of the Skagerrak concentrations yielded unsatisfactory results. In April 1992, during what appears as a major spawning season of the {{greater silver smelt}}, abundance estimation by the SIMRAD EK 500 echo sounder and integrator was attempted. Comparisons were made between observations made by the hull-mounted transducer and a transducer mounted in a newly developed towed body...|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{sourcing}} high quality non-quota fish species {{continues to increase}} as fish quotas tighten and traditional whitefish stocks decline. Quality aspects of one such species, silver smelt. (Argentinus silus), were examined {{in an article in}} Farm and Food, October-December 1991. This work has now been extended using spot samples of a further six deep water, non-quota species caught in the Atlantic off the north west coast of Ireland. The tests, which will continue on an annual basis, are a co-operative effort between staff at The Fisheries Research Centre and The National Food Centre. The six species evaluated were Bairds smoothead (Alepocephalus bairdii), blue ling, (Molva dypterygia), black scabbard(Aphanopus carbo), rabbitfish (Chimaera monstrosa), roundnose grenadier (<b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris)</b> and greater forkbeard (Phycis blennoides). Details of catching, procurement and fish characteristics are reported from The Fisheries Research Centre, while tests for proximate analysis, water holding capacity, gel strength, and colour were carried out at The National Food Centre using samples which were blast frozen at sea...|$|R
40|$|Data {{obtained}} {{during a}} Spanish experimental fishing survey, performed in deep {{waters of the}} North East Atlantic, on board a vessel of the commercial fishing fleet, from 3 rd September to 17 th November 1994, were analyzed. The survey was aimed at prospecting new fishing zones and possible new commercially viable species at depths of over 800 metres. The areas prospected were in international waters, between parallels 54 º and 57 ºN, in Subarea XII and ICES Division VIb. Nets were hauled at depths ranging between 873 and 1190 metres. The species with the largest CPUE's were Alepocephalus bairdii, with 178 k/f. h., <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris,</b> with 159 k/f. h. and Centroscymnus coelolepis with 97 k/f. h. The other species presented CPUE's of below 35 k/f. h. The CPUE values for the total catch increased with depth. In general terms, catch included larger sized individuals than those caught by the Spanish trawler fleet in shallower waters...|$|R
40|$|Little is {{understood}} about connectivity of deep-sea fish populations. Analysis of the geochemical properties of fish otoliths {{is one way}} to draw inferences regarding their movements and habitat use in the marine environment. Trace element and stable isotope analyses of otoliths were undertaken to assess patterns of spatial and temporal population structure of a wide-ranging deepwater fish, the roundnose grenadier <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris.</b> Fish were sampled from 4 locations across the distribution range of the species in the northeast Atlantic. Multivariate analyses of elemental ratios (Li/Ca, Mn/Ca, Ba/Ca, Zn/Ca, Cu/Ca) revealed strong geographic separation at each life stage, and an overall significant difference between life stages. Otolith oxygen (? 18 O) and carbon (? 13 C) stable isotope analysis indicated a depth migration (and reduction in metabolic activity) from relatively shallow in the juvenile phase to much deeper in the adult phase at all locations. The results suggest that roundnose grenadier are comprised of geographically distinct population units that persist throughout their life-history, migrating deeper as they get older...|$|R
40|$|The Macrourid fish roundnose grenadier, <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris,</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common benthopelagic fishes on the {{northern}} mid-Atlantic Ridge. The ecology of the species is comparatively well studied in continental slope waters of the North Atlantic, but not on the mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is a central mid-ocean area of its distribution. In total, 166 specimens from the RV G. O. Sars cruise in July 2004 were examined. The diet mainly comprised cephalopods, pelagic shrimps and fish. Pelagic and benthopelagic copepods were the most numerous prey, but did not contribute much on a weight basis. Cephalopods were by far the most important prey of the small grenadiers, while shrimps and fish became increasingly significant with increasing size. Previous studies from other areas have also found pelagic prey to be important, but in contrast to this study, cephalopods were generally of less importance. The study was an element of more wideranging food-web studies of the mid-Atlantic Ridge macro- and megafauna communities within the international MAR-ECO project...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{morphological}} and chemical characteristics of otoliths have recently been proposed as complementary tools for fish stock identification. However, their effectiveness remains to be fully assessed, especially in species whose life history is still poorly understood. The relative efficiency of otolith microchemistry and otolith shape analysis in discriminating samples of the deep-sea macrourid <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> collected in different areas in the North Atlantic was examined. Otolith microchemistry based on LA/ICP-MS found {{significant differences in the}} concentrations of lithium, manganese and barium among sample sites. This allowed for very high classification accuracy (92 %), when using discriminant function analysis. Otolith shape analysis based both on linear shape measurements and elliptical fourier analysis revealed a contrasting weak discrimination, with only 43 % classification success. Otolith microchemistry appears to be a more effective tool in identifying individual fish from different locations. The implications for the study of population structure are discussed taking into account the limitations of the methodologies employed...|$|R
40|$|In the early- 1960 s a {{deepwater}} form of redfish (Sebastes mentella Travin) {{was found}} at depths more than 500 m on the continental slopes of Labrador and North Newfoundland. This group differed from the beaked redfish commonly distributed in these areas by the biological peculiarities of non-developed reproductive organs and lack of sexual dimorphism. The results of nearly 30 -year observations showed that the form of non-maturing redfish had not changed. They were distributed along the continental slope northward of Div. 3 K and the fish size increased from north to south. The distribution of this form of redfish {{was similar to that}} of non-maturing roundnose grenadier (<b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris).</b> The origin and causes which led to inhibition of gonadal development of both groups were considered to be analogous. The non-maturing group of redfish was thought to originate from partial eggs and larval drifts from the Irminger Sea to form a pseudo-population in the area studied. The need for studies of the population and its exploitation of this potentially commercially valuable group is emphasized...|$|R
40|$|The WKAMDEEP met at IMEDEA (UIB/CSIC) in Esporles, Spain from 21 to 25 Octo-ber 2013 {{to review}} age {{determination}} methods and growth patterns of several deep-water fish species {{in order to}} pave the way for solid input data of future age-based assessments for these species. The species dealt with by the Group were: tusk (Brosme brosme), ling (Molva molva), blue ling (Molva dypterygia), roundnose grenadier (<b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris),</b> greater silver smelt (Argentina silus), black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) and black-spotted sea bream (Pagellus bogaraveo). All relevant information was collated in species-specific annexes, in order to have a protocol which was easy to consult and use for each species. The main report sums up the discussions in the group and presents results from the small WebGr-exchanges of each species made prior to and during the meeting. The body of the report is found in the species-specific annexes, which describe the general biological knowledge of growth and longevity for each species, review available ageing protocols, identify any unresolved problems with interpretation and recommend future actions...|$|R
40|$|The {{result of}} a {{questionnaire}} sent to 38 institutes, indicate that {{a broad range of}} unpublished raw data exist on many of the deep water fish species in the north east Atlantic and Mediterranean. Of the 18 fish classified by ICES as 'primary' deep water species, {{one or more of the}} six <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris,</b> Mora moro, Aphanopus carbo, Hoplostethus atlanticus, Phycis blennoides, Helicolenus dactylopterus were common to most of the institutes which completed the questionnaire. Institutes which possessed some form of otolith or ageing data on these primary fish are grouped by species. A table of institutions which have some form of data on other deep water species (including sharks, rays and Chimaerids) is presented. A list of the main deep water species is given with their English, French, and Spanish common names. In general, there was a very positive response to the setting up of an otolith exchange scheme (by correspondence), as an initial approach to the convening of a deep water ageing workshop. The questionnaire did not provide any indications as to the extent or quality of the various data sets...|$|R
40|$|Sagittal {{otoliths}} of <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> (roundnose grenadier), Helicolenus dactylopterus (bluemouth) and Merluccius merluccius (European hake) {{were collected}} {{using a variety}} of handling and storage treatments and their elemental composition was examined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Some differences between element concentrations were identified between the control and treatment groups, most notably for the element Li. For H. dactylopterus and M. merluccius, Li concentrations were significantly higher in the otoliths extracted with metal forceps and stored in paper envelopes (treatment), compared to those from the same fishes that had been extracted using plastic forceps and stored in polyethylene vials (control). Lower concentrations of Ba and Cr were found in M. merluccius otoliths extracted from fish that had been stored frozen. The presence or absence of elemental concentrations above the instrumental limits of detection was noted, but no significant differences were identified between otolith pairs for any of the treatments. The differences between otolith pairs attributable to storage and handling effects are small compared to between-area differences. © 2006 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for evaluating fisheries management plans comprehensively, both rebuilding plans and others. The framework includes a first rapid appraisal of {{the likelihood that the}} plan will result in management meeting its objectives, and guides subsequent quantitative analyses of potential weaknesses in the proposed plan. The framework includes four steps: (i) evaluating if a set of management objectives, if achieved, would result in a sustainable fishery, (ii) using qualitative analysis of a bio-economic model to evaluate whether the set of stock management tactics might be capable of achieving the specified fisheries objectives, (iii) using empirical criteria derived from the literature to evaluate if other management measures in the plan related to the ecological, social or economic context of the fishery actually contribute to sustainability, and (iv) carrying out quantitative simulations to compare alternative implementation options. Generally, several management measures have to be combined to increase stock size without sacrificing the economic benefits to the fishers remaining in the fishery. We demonstrate application of the framework for evaluating the stock rebuilding plan for plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and sole (Solea solea) in the North Sea and, the management measures currently in place for the roundnose grenadier (<b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris)</b> stock exploited {{to the west of the}} British Isles...|$|R
40|$|Bear Seamount (39 ° 55 'N, 67 ° 30 'W) is an extinct undersea volcano located {{inside the}} U. S. Exclusive Economic Zone south of Georges Bank. The fauna {{associated}} with the seamount was little known until twenty trawl stations were made 2 - 7 December 2000, by the NOAA ship Delaware II. The objective of the cruise was to begin to document the biodiversity on and over the seamount, particularly of fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans. Representatives of most species were preserved as vouchers and for subsequent definitive identification. Preliminary identifications indicate the capture of 115 fish species. Among these {{were a number of}} new fish records for the area or rare species, including Acromycter pertubator (Congridae), Alepocephalus bairdii (Alepocephalidae), Mirognathus normani (Alepocephalidae), Bathygadus favosus (Bathygadidae), Nezumia longebarbata (Macrouridae), Gaidropsarus argentatus (Phycidae), and Dibranchus tremendus (Ogcocephalidae). Only two fish species of potential commercial importance were encountered: <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> and Macrourus berglax. Cephalopods comprised 26 species in 15 families, including one new distributional record and several rarelycollected species. The crustacean fauna was diverse with at least 46 species. Totals for other invertebrate species are pending laboratory identification, but number at least 113 species in 10 phyla.

40|$|Analysis {{of video}} {{recordings}} {{performed by the}} submersible “Nautile” in the Bay of Biscay, NE Atlantic indicated that demersal fish species are associated to different types of deep-sea habitats. Four different dive transects were analysed with respect to environmental characteristics. A total of 19 fish groups were ordinated by means of canonical correspondence analysis, and the investigation was performed at the individual fish level. Microhabitat fauna was dominated by a diversity of suspension feeders indicating different gradients of bottom hydrology, particularly vertical and horizontal current flow. Physical, geological and biological factors revealed different strategies of habitat selection in fish. The most represented species, the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) showed a clear association with complex bottoms, including coral reefs. Others, such as <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> and Synaphobranchus kaupi, showed higher flexibility of adjustment to changing environments. These traits can be utilised {{in the study of}} the environmental impact of deep-sea fishing. Based on the same dives, the locomotory behaviour of 13 fish species was studied with basis on a qualitative analysis of selected individuals. The main swimming modes used in shallow waters were also detected in the demersal environment. Clear differences in locomotory behaviour were found among fish species, reflecting both convergence and diversity of strategies of utilization of the demersal niche space...|$|R
40|$|While {{deep-sea fish}} {{accumulate}} {{high levels of}} persistent organic pollutants (POPs), the toxicity associated with this contamination remains unknown. Indeed, the recurrent collection of moribund individuals precludes experimental studies to investigate POP effects in this fauna. We show that precision-cut liver slices (PCLS), an in vitro tool commonly used in human and rodent toxicology, can overcome such limitation. This technology was applied to individuals of the deep-sea grenadier <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> directly upon retrieval from 530 -m depth in Trondheimsfjord (Norway). PCLS remained viable and functional for 15 h when maintained in an appropriate culture media at 4 °C. This allowed experimental exposure of liver slices to the model POP 3 -methylcholanthrene (3 -MC; 25 µM) at levels of hydrostatic pressure mimicking shallow (0. 1 megapascal or MPa) and deep-sea (5 – 15 MPa; representative of 500 – 1500 m depth) environments. As in shallow water fish, 3 -MC induced the transcription of the detoxification enzyme cytochrome P 4501 A (CYP 1 A; a biomarker of exposure to POPs). This induction was diminished at elevated pressure, suggesting a limited responsiveness of C. rupestris toward POPs in its native environment. This very first in vitro toxicological investigation on a deep-sea fish opens the route for understanding pollutants effects in this highly exposed fauna...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} Spanish deep-sea fishery performed in international waters on the Hatton Bank and proximities (NE Atlantic) {{during the period}} 1996 - 2000. This is a multi-species fishery, carried out by stern bottom trawlers, mainly between June and September, in depths mainly between 800 m to 1600 m. The importance of the fishing activity {{in this area is}} increasing notably. This fishery has been monitored since the beginning in 1996, with the collaboration of the fishing industry, by means of a scientific observer programme. The observers on board provide data on catches, discards, location and depth, haul by haul. Length samples of the main species and biological material are also collected. The species composition of the catches is presented. In terms of weight, the roundnose grenadier (<b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris)</b> and the bairdii smoothhead (Alepocephalus bairdi i) are the most important species in the catches. Other less important species are the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis) and the blue ling (Molva dypterygia). In addition to the total catch, the composition of the retained catch and the discard are studied. For the main retained species, the dressing types are described and the conversion coefficients are presented.

40|$|Roundnose {{grenadier}} (<b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> Gunnerus) {{were found}} in reasonable concentrations in four areas in Trøndelag, Norway. Inside the Trondheimsfjord, within a 400 to 500 m deep basin, about 340 kg was taken per half-hour-tow using a bottom prawn trawl. Around 500 kg per half-hour was taken in a 400 - 530 m deep basin in the Flatanger-Folla area, while catches above 3060 kg per half-hour were taken in a 350 m deep basin in the inner part of Foldenfjorden. Only few specimens were taken by use of pelagic trawl. In the deeper basins outside the near coastal areas, the catch rates were found too small for commercial fishing. The age of maturity {{was found to be}} about 8 and 10 years for males and females, respectively. Natural mortality rate was estimated to 0. 1. The biomass in the four major areas was calculated to about 15 000 tonnes using echo-integrations combined with pelagic and bottom trawl sampling, and a sustainable yield of 2000 per year was suggested. The roundnose grenadier was only found in waters with temperatures above 7. 0 °C.

40|$|Relative eye size, gross brain {{morphology}} {{and central}} localization of 2 -[125 I]iodomelatonin binding sites and melatonin receptor gene expression were compared in six gadiform fish living at different depths in the north-east Atlantic Ocean: Phycis blennoides (capture depth range 265 to 1260 m), Nezumia aequalis (445 to 1512 m), <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> (706 to 1932 m), Trachyrincus murrayi (1010 to 1884 m), Coryphaenoides guentheri (1030 m) and Coryphaenoides (Nematonurus) armatus (2172 to 4787 m). Amongst these, the eye size range was 0. 15 to 0. 35 of head length with {{a value of}} 0. 19 for C. (N.) armatus, the deepest species. Brain morphology reflected behavioural differences with well-developed olfactory regions in P. blennoides, T. murrayi and C. (N.) armatus and evidence of olfactory deficit in N. aequalis, C. rupestris and C. guentheri. All species had a clearly defined optic tectum with 2 -[125 I]iodomelatonin binding and melatonin receptor gene expression localized to specific brain regions in a similar pattern to that found in shallow-water fish. Melatonin receptors were found throughout the visual structures of the brains of all species. Despite living beyond the depth of penetration of solar light these fish have retained central features associated with the coupling of cycles of growth, behaviour and reproduction to the diel light–dark cycle. How this functions in the deep sea remains enigmatic...|$|R
40|$|A {{time series}} from 1977 – 1989 and 2000 – 2002 of {{scientific}} trawl surveys in the Porcupine Seabight and adjacent Abyssal Plain of the NE Atlantic was analysed to assess changes in demersal fish biomass and length frequency. These two periods {{coincide with the}} on-set of the commercial deep-water fishery in the late 1970 s and the on-set of the regulation of the fishery in the early 2000 's and allowed us to investigate changes {{in the relationship between}} total demersal fish biomass and depth between the pre- and post commercial fishing periods, changes in the biomass (kg km 2 ) depth distribution and length frequency distribution of the most dominant fish species. Our results show a decline in total demersal fish biomass of 36 % within the depth range of the commercial fishery (<b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> decreased by 57 %) and non-target (e. g. Coryphaenoides guentheri and Antimora rostrata) species, not all species declined significantly. Changes in the overall length-frequency distribution were detected for 2 species (Coryphaenoides armatus, Synaphobranchus kaupii), but only at depths greater than 1800 m (outside the maximum depth for commercial trawling). This suggests that whilst there is evidence for likely fisheries impacts on the biomass distribution of the demersal fish population as a whole, species-specific impacts are highly variable. It is clear that changes in population structure can extend beyond the depth at which fishing takes place, highlighting the importance for also considering the indirect effects on deep-sea fish populations...|$|R

Since the late 1980 s, commercial bottom-trawl fisheries targeting mainly roundnose grenadier (<b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris),</b> black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo), and orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) have been operating at depths of 500 - 1500 m, intersecting the depth ranges of 77 demersal fish species that would therefore be vulnerable to fishery effects. Comparisons of trawls pre- 1989 and post- 1997 indicate {{a significant decrease in}} total abundance of demersal fish down to 2500 m. Detailed analyses of the 15 most-abundant species showed that nine species with depth ranges within the commercial fishing depth have decreased in abundance. Other species were either not affected (Bathypterois dubius) or only affected at the shallow end of their range (Coryphaenoides guentheri). Species with a minimum depth of occurrence > 1500 m (Coryphaenoides armatus and Coryphaenoides leptolepis) increased in abundance over part of their depth range. Decreases in abundance are probably caused by commercial fishing activities, an effect that is transmitted downslope by removal of fish at the shallow end of their depth range, resulting in declines at the deeper end of the depth range. The estimated fishery area is ca. 52 000 km(2), but the potential impact probably extends to ca. 142 000 km(2) and to many non-target species...|$|R
40|$|Ongoing deep-sea {{fisheries}} off Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada {{since the late}} 1960 s have resulted in large population declines of both targeted and non-targeted species. The lack of in situ observations from deep waters in this region limit {{our understanding of the}} factors influencing distributions of vulnerable taxa such as corals and fish, and the links between them. I analyzed data from a research cruise that used a remotely operated vehicle to explore 105 km of seafloor, spanning a depth range of 351 - 2245 m, in three canyons off Newfoundland and Labrador in 2007. I observed over 160, 000 coral colonies, comprising 28 species, and over 18, 000 individual fishes, comprising at least 74 species. Distinct assemblages of deep-sea corals and fishes were found based on habitat type (or bottom type) and depth. Keratoisis grayi was more likely to be broken, dead or partially dead, and less abundant in trawled areas. Multiple factors predicted grenadier abundance and/or presence, but these varied in importance with sampling resolution. Using life table analyses, I predict prolonged recovery rates for two deep-sea fishes: <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> and Macrourus berg/ax. These findings illustrate that deep-sea corals influence the distribution and abundance of fishes, that trawling negatively affects long-lived deep-sea corals in this region, that deep-sea fishes will recover slowly (if at all) from documented declines, and that many unknowns remain regarding the sustainability of this ecosystem. Nonetheless, these findings can help to support deep-sea conservation efforts off Newfoundland and Labrador...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the trophic ecology {{of two of}} the dominant families of deep-sea fish (Macrouridae and Moridae) fatty acid and stable isotope analyses were applied to liver and muscle samples of five abundant species from the NE Atlantic. In conjunction with stomach content data these methods made it possible to identify differences in feeding strategies between the five study species as well as variation in feeding in relation to increasing depth and body size. Biomarkers identified strong similarities between Coryphaenoides armatus and Antimora rostrata though differences were found associating C armatus more with the benthic food web whereas A. rostrata showed stronger links to the pelagic food web. While Lepidion eques was classified as a species linking benthic and benthopelagic food webs, both fatty acid and stable isotope data suggested that Coryphaenoides guentheri fed on an exclusively benthic diet. <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> on the other hand were largely dependent on a copepod-based food web. Ontogenetic changes in feeding were found for both A. rostrato and C armatus with the indication of a switch from active predation to scavenging occurring with increasing body size. Biomarkers also reflected the seasonal influx from the photic zone though changes were species-specific and probably reflected the variation in prey availability and abundance in response to these inputs. Our findings have thus demonstrated that the combined use of these biomarkers can elucidate trophic specialisations in situations where conventional methods alone previously provided insufficient data...|$|R
40|$|Deep-sea {{fish are}} highly {{contaminated}} with organochlorine compounds(OCs), which are persistent man-made chemicals. Because {{it is very}} difficult to maintain these fish alive for toxicological experiments, the real impact of such contamination remains unknown. By analysing liver samples of the deep-sea grenadier <b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> (200 - 2600 meter depth), we first observed signs of an oxidative impact linked to OCs' metabolism. The activity of the phase 1 detoxification cytochrome P 4501 A (CYP 1 A) enzyme was positively correlated to OCs loads and antioxidant enzymes activities (catalase, superoxide dismutase). Still, the magnitude of CYP 1 A induction was fairly low compared to the huge contamination. We then developed the precision-cut liver slices (PCLS) technology to study more in-depth the oxidative impact of OCs' metabolism on living liver cells of C. rupestris. Two shallow fish (Salmo salar, Dicentrarchus labrax) were also chosen as basis for comparison. Hyperbaric cylinders were used to investigate in this comparative study the effects of the high hydrostatic pressure (typical of the deep-sea) on the response of liver cells of these fish to contaminants, their pro- and anti-oxidant status and that of heat shock proteins (also known to participate in a general stress response to toxicants). Apart from the obtention of the first-ever data on living deep-sea fish liver cells, we found a striking pressure-dependent reduction of CYP 1 A induction in each species, suggesting that deep-sea fish might be less prone to the oxidative impact of OCs metabolism in their environment (a feature that might explain their high OCs loads).

40|$|Feeding {{habits and}} {{biological}} features of three deep-water species -large-eyed rabbitfish (Hydrolagus mirabilis), narrownose chimaera (Harriotta raleighana) and black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii) - {{distributed in the}} Grand Bank and Flemish Cap (Northwest Atlantic) were analyzed. Both chimaeroid species fed on endo and epi-benthic organisms, but with different behavior. Narrownose chimaera showed a closer relationship with the sea bed in the feeding habits, denoted mainly by the high polychaete and sediment presence; while in large-eyed rabbitfish, the great importance of pelagic prey (<b>Coryphaenoides</b> <b>rupestris</b> and cephalopods) would indicate wider feeding habits, increased with the predator size. Black dogfish preyed mostly on pelagic and benthopelagic prey (crustaceans, scyphozoans and fish). High infestation of Gyrocotyle affected the chimaeroid species, increasing with depth. The parasitation affected 67 % of large-eyed rabbitfish, with higher percentage for smaller individuals; narrownose chimaera (84 % with parasites) had {{a greater number of}} parasites per host, and bigger individuals were more affected. However, presence of Gyrocotyle did not seem to harm the well-being of the specimens. Length-weight relationship indicated bigger body weight for males in the small sizes of 108, 31. 5 and 50 cm of large-eyed rabbitfish, narrownose chimaera and black dogfish respectively. However, the body-eviscerated weigh relationship did not show differences between sexes. The hepatosomatic index (HIS) was high in all species, mainly in narrownose chimaera (31. 3 %) and it reached in the other species a value around the fourth part of their eviscerated weight. Black dogfish showed a clear increase of HSI with the body weight, while chimaerids presented a bigger variation...|$|R
