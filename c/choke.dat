40|$|Abstract: <b>Choking</b> is a preventable, but {{common cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the pediatric population, with children younger than 3 years at greatest risk. A number of factors place children at higher risk for <b>choking,</b> including narrower airways, immature dentition, underdeveloped chewing and swallowing ability, and high levels of activity and distractibility. Candy, meat, and bone are responsible {{for more than half of}} nonfatal food-related <b>choking,</b> while the hot dog is the most common food associated with <b>choking</b> fatalities. Coins, button batteries, small toys, and toy parts are the leading causes of nonfatal <b>choking</b> not due to food, while latex balloons are the leading cause of nonfood-related <b>choking</b> fatalities. Pediatric <b>choking</b> is an important public health concern that needs to be addressed during well-child visits and through increased public education. Parents and child caregivers should receive training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and <b>choking</b> rescue maneuvers. Increased efforts are also needed in the areas of public policy, <b>choking</b> surveillance, and food design and labeling...|$|R
50|$|The {{variator}} pulley of an iCVT is <b>choked</b> {{using two}} small <b>choking</b> pulleys. Here one <b>choking</b> pulley is positioned on the tense {{side of the}} chain of the iCVT. Hence there is a considerable load on that <b>choking</b> pulley, the magnitude of which {{is proportional to the}} tension in its chain. Each <b>choking</b> pulley is pulled up by two chain segments, one chain segment to the left and one {{to the right of the}} <b>choking</b> pulley; here if the two chain segments are parallel to each other, then the load on the <b>choking</b> pulley is twice the tension in the chain. But since the two chain segments are most likely not parallel to each other during operations of an iCVT, it is estimated that the load on a <b>choking</b> pulley is between 1 and 1.8 times of the tension of its chain.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>chokes,</b> {{especially}} collar <b>chokes,</b> {{are also}} available from the mounted position. Such <b>chokes</b> are generally limited to sporting contestants who wear a gi or, in real-life combat, opponents wearing thick jackets, which provide a collar {{as an aid to}} <b>choking,</b> but attempting them at a gi-less situation can be successful if the performer manages to hold his opponent.|$|R
5|$|Returning to Cage Warriors, Wallhead {{faced the}} UFC-bound Dennis Siver. Despite {{being on a}} three fight winning streak, Wallhead was {{submitted}} via armbar taking his record to 8–4. Wallhead faced Lewis Barrow four months later and won via submission (punches) to begin a four fight win streak. Wallhead's next three fights resulted in submission victories; a victory via <b>choke</b> over Jordan James, an arm-triangle <b>choke</b> victory over Soli Clichko and a rear naked <b>choke</b> victory over Steven Lynch.|$|E

5000|$|Active and Unconscious <b>Choking</b> - Active <b>choking</b> {{measures}} {{make use}} of back blows and abdominal thrusts to try and force out the object blocking the victim's airway; Unconscious <b>choking</b> measures are similar to CPR with a few small change.|$|R
50|$|<b>Choking</b> is the {{mechanical}} obstruction {{of the flow}} of air from the environment into the lungs. <b>Choking</b> prevents breathing, and can be partial or complete, with partial <b>choking</b> allowing some, although inadequate, flow of air into the lungs. Prolonged or complete <b>choking</b> results in asphyxia which leads to anoxia and is potentially fatal. Oxygen stored in the blood and lungs can keep a person alive for several minutes after breathing stops.|$|R
40|$|<b>Choking</b> {{incidents}} {{have long}} been recognized {{as a cause of}} death in people with mental illness. This study attempted to determine the rate of <b>choking</b> incidents and deaths among psychiatric inpatients and identify the risk factors associated with <b>choking</b> incidents. Some preventive measures are also suggested. Methods: All <b>choking</b> incidents recorded over 3 years in 3 psychiatric wards of Chutung Veterans General Hospital (total of 210 beds) were retrospectively analyzed for demographic variables, psychiatric and medical diagnoses, and drug therapy {{at the time of the}} incidents. Results: During the 3 -year period, 16 incidents were recorded, involving 11 patients at a rate of 1 incident every 451. 4 months of hospitalization per person. Men were 3 times more likely to experience <b>choking</b> incidents than women, and the mean age of <b>choking</b> patients was higher than that of all patients (59. 7 vs. 44. 4 years). Among the 16 incidents, 3 fatal cases were noted, giving an annual <b>choking</b> death rate of 5. 05 per 1, 000 persons hospitalized. A high re-choking rate of up to 40. 0 % was noted, and patients with organic mental disorder had 3. 4 times the <b>choking</b> incidence of all patients. The mean antipsychotic dosage of the <b>choking</b> cases was similar to that of all inpatients, but the mean hypnotic dosage of the fatal <b>choking</b> cases was significantly higher. Up to 62. 5 % of the <b>choking</b> accidents occurred at breakfast, and mantou (a type of steamed bun) was the most common food (9 / 16) that resulted in the accidents. Of the 11 patients, 9 were rated as “poor” or “very poor” with regard to self-care before the accidents. Conclusion: Compared with studies in Western psychiatric inpatients, we have a lower <b>choking</b> incident rate but higher death rate due to <b>choking.</b> We found that older age, male sex, higher dosage of hypnotics, previous <b>choking</b> attacks, organic mental disorder, poor self-care, breakfast time and mantou were possible risk factors associated with <b>choking,</b> in which older age, poor self-care, and higher dosage of hypnotics for fatal cases were statistically significant...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Choking</b> during meals is {{a common}} symptom in the elderly, however the factors {{associated}} with it have not been fully clarified. In this study, we examined the factors associated with <b>choking</b> during meals. Methods: The oral health status and practices that promote oral health conditions was surveyed in 1305 community dwelling elderly using a self-administered questionnaire. Eight items including satisfaction with their oral condition, denture fit, chewing ability, tooth brushing frequency, dental visits, exercises to train muscles for chewing and swallowing, <b>choking</b> during meals, and repetitive fever were selected for analysis. Results: 25. 1 % of the subjects experienced <b>choking</b> during meals, which {{was significantly associated with}} repetitive fever occurrence. Differences in satisfaction levels with their oral condition, denture fit, chewing ability, and tooth brushing frequency were observed between groups with and without <b>choking.</b> Age, satisfaction level, and chewing ability were significantly associated with <b>choking</b> during meals. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that <b>choking</b> during meals is a risk indicator for repetitive fever in the elderly living in community settings. Poor chewing ability and dissatisfaction with their oral condition were risk factors associated with <b>choking.</b> These results suggest that training the elderly to eat efficiently and safely and improving oral conditions is necessary for those who suffer from <b>choking</b> during meals to prevent repetitive fever.  ...|$|R

5|$|The fourth match, between Minoru Suzuki and Kazushi Sakuraba, was {{conducted}} under UWFi rules; {{it would end}} with a knockout, submission, or referee stoppage. During the match, Sakuraba and Suzuki battled onto the entrance ramp, where Sakuraba used a kimura lock to injure Suzuki's arm. When {{they returned to the}} ring, Sakuraba targeted Suzuki's injured arm with kicks, stomps, and a cross armbreaker hold. Suzuki withstood the assault, responding with slaps with his good arm and a running kick to Sakuraba's face. Suzuki applied a rear naked <b>choke,</b> making a judo throw while maintaining the <b>choke</b> (Saka Otoshi). Sakuraba fought the hold until he lost consciousness, at which point the referee stopped the match in favour of Suzuki at 9 minutes and 21 seconds. After the match, the wrestlers shook hands and embraced.|$|E
40|$|In general, <b>choking</b> {{has been}} defined as the {{occurrence}} of sub-optimal performance under pressure (Baumeister and Showers, 1986). The most widely accepted theory of <b>choking</b> is what I have labeled the “automatic execution model” (Baumeister, 1984), the basic premise being that <b>choking</b> occurs due to the inhibition of well-learned or automatic skills. The present dissertation was designed to test the automatic execution model in a sport context. Beyond this, I was interested in broadening the research paradigm by concentrating on <b>choking</b> as a process. The five inter-related studies contained in this dissertation tested predictors of <b>choking,</b> perceptions of pressure, coping processes, the automatic execution model, and gender differences. The general aim of this dissertation was to produce an integrated model of <b>choking</b> in sport. The five studies used to examine <b>choking</b> had a total of 89 competitive basketball players as participants (M = 20. 01 years old, SD = 2. 12). Sixty-four participants took part in studies, 1, 2, 3 and 5. The remaining 25 participants took par...|$|R

5|$|The twelfth season saw the UFC Welterweight {{champion}} Georges St-Pierre coach alongside former opponent {{and number}} one contender to the title, Josh Koscheck. The season saw {{the continuation of}} the wildcard format and 14-man tournament bracket. The show's number one pick was Marc Stevens, who would go on to lose in one of the quickest submissions (via guillotine <b>choke)</b> in the show's history. The wildcard slots went to Marc Stevens and Aaron Wilkinson, with Wilkinson handing Stevens his second successive guillotine <b>choke</b> loss. The show was dominated by Josh Koscheck's attempts to annoy Georges St-Pierre, with St-Pierre's paramedic getting involved in the arguments with Koscheck. The finale was a match between Jonathan Brookins and Michael Johnson on December 4, 2010 which resulted in Brookins winning via unanimous decision.|$|E
5|$|After {{going to}} the ground, Jackson managed to slip out of the <b>choke.</b> Jackson began to attack with ground and pound, dealing strikes to Silva's body while Silva {{answered}} with the same from the bottom. Jackson began to land punches to Silva's face, and the latter attempted a Juji-gatame, a variation of an armbar. Silva could not pull off the hold, and Jackson moved into side control shortly after. From here, Jackson threw punches to Silva's head and followed by landing two knees, again to the head (which were legal under Pride rules).|$|E
