25|$|For opposite-sex couples, a civil {{union or}} {{domestic}} partnership contracted {{in another state}} or foreign jurisdiction will, in all likelihood, be honored as a domestic partnership in California if at least one partner is 62 {{years of age or}} older. However, if both partners are under age 62, the union will likely be void and of no legal effect in California. For example, Colorado, Hawaii and Illinois afford all opposite-sex couples over 18 years old the right to establish civil unions, and Nevada allows opposite-sex couples over 18 years old to establish domestic partnerships; such unions in these states are functionally equivalent to marriage. But, <b>California</b> <b>will</b> only recognize these unions if {{at least one of the}} opposite-sex partners is 62 years of age or older.|$|E
