40|$|We outline some of <b>Chris</b> <b>Wallace's</b> {{contributions}} to pseudo-random number generation. In particular, we consider his idea for generating normally distributed variates without {{relying on a}} source of uniform random numbers, and compare it with more conventional methods for generating normal random numbers. Implementations of Wallace's idea can be very fast (approximately as fast as good uniform generators). We discuss the statistical quality of the output, and mention how certain pitfalls can be avoided. Comment: 13 pages. For further information, see [URL]...|$|R

500|$|In 2002, West became {{general manager}} of the Memphis Grizzlies. He {{explained}} his decision with the desire for exploring something new: [...] "After being a part of the Lakers success for so many years, I have always wondered how it would be to build a winning franchise that has not experienced much success. I want to help make a difference." [...] West's Memphis stint was not as spectacular as his Los Angeles stint, but he turned a franchise which was about to be sold into a reliable playoffs team, practically making no trades but getting the maximum from the players he had available (e.g. Pau Gasol, James Posey and Jason Williams) and signing coach Hubie Brown, who became Coach of the Year in 2004. West himself won his second NBA Executive of the Year Award in the same year. At age 69, West retired as a Grizzlies general manager in 2007 and turned over managing duties to <b>Chris</b> <b>Wallace,</b> from Buckhannon, West Virginia.|$|E
500|$|She {{disagreed}} with Fox News' <b>Chris</b> <b>Wallace</b> in 2006 when Wallace {{asked why the}} American people were beginning to lose confidence in President Bush, saying, [...] "Well, I don't think they are. And I don't really believe those polls. I travel around the country, I see people, I see their response to my husband, I see their response to me. There {{are a lot of}} difficult challenges right now in the United States... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them... When his polls were really high they weren't on the front page." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 30, Barr {{appeared}} on Fox News Sunday with <b>Chris</b> <b>Wallace.</b> He described his qualms with the presumptive Republican nominee, and said [...] "John McCain {{is symptomatic of}} what's wrong with the Republican Party in these {{first years of the}} 21st century. They talk one thing but do something different." [...] When asked if he agreed that McCain would be a better choice than Barack Obama, he responded that it was [...] "a mixed bag" [...] and that [...] "Senator Obama clearly is much better [...] civil liberties and privacy issues" [...] but that he [...] "would favor a more expansive federal spending policy." [...] Barr opined that [...] "neither of these candidates is talking about the deep cuts in government spending and returning power to the people." [...] He identified the Republican Party's position on FISA legislation as his biggest aversion to the party. When confronted with opinion polls that showed the candidate with 3% in the presidential race, Barr explained that the numbers would increase in the following weeks, announcing that his campaign would be launched [...] "full-time" [...] on July 4.|$|E

500|$|Months later, {{during an}} April 1988 {{appearance}} on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Trump discussed his displeasure with the United States' {{status as a}} [...] "debtor nation" [...] and its seeming inability to compete with Japan. [...] Winfrey asked Trump if he would ever run for president. [...] He replied, [...] "Probably not, but I do get tired of seeing the country get ripped off ... I just don't think I have the inclination to do it." [...] Furthermore, he asserted that if he ever did run, he would win the election. [...] He later appeared at the 1988 Republican National Convention. [...] In an interview on the floor, NBC News reporter <b>Chris</b> <b>Wallace</b> asked whether Trump's visit to his first national convention would induce him to [...] "take the plunge" [...] into a presidential campaign. [...] In response, Trump downplayed his prior exploration into presidential politics, though repeated that he would win if he ever ran, and praised then-presumptive Republican presidential nominee George H. W. Bush. [...] During another convention interview on Larry King Live, Trump dismissed the speculation that he had considered running for president and commented, [...] "I doubt I’ll ever be involved in politics beyond what I do right now." [...] Talk of a potential Trump candidacy grew silent {{for much of the}} next decade.|$|E
500|$|On February 1, 2008, Gasol {{was traded}} to the Los Angeles Lakers along with a 2010 second round draft pick for Kwame Brown, Javaris Crittenton, Aaron McKie, the rights to Marc Gasol (Pau's younger brother), and 2008 and 2010 first round draft picks. There has been some {{controversy}} surrounding the trade. <b>Chris</b> <b>Wallace</b> denied in an ESPN article that he had been ordered by owner Michael Heisley to make the Grizzlies more attractive to a potential buyer. Wallace said, [...] "No one put pressure on me to do this, and Michael Heisley has actually been reluctant to move Pau." [...] He also said that they had been [...] "trolling" [...] the waters for a while and dealt with a number of teams. He selected the Lakers deal because [...] "it didn't get any better than this." [...] When Gasol departed the Grizzlies, he held twelve franchise records, including games played, minutes played, field goals made, free throws made and attempted, offensive, defensive, and total rebounds, blocked shots, turnovers, and points. Per game statistics, he leads Memphis in defensive and total rebounds along with blocked shots. On February 5, he made his first Lakers appearance in a game against the New Jersey Nets, during which he scored 24 points and had 12 rebounds in a 105–90 win over the Nets. On March 14, Gasol sprained his ankle in a game against the New Orleans Hornets, stepping on the foot of teammate Vladimir Radmanović in the first quarter. Gasol was expected to miss the remaining three games of the Lakers' road trip after x-rays came up negative. Gasol returned to the starting lineup on April 2 against the Portland Trail Blazers and played nearly thirty-two minutes, registering 10 points, six rebounds and seven assists. He admitted to feeling limited with the swelling in his ankle still present. Gasol helped the Lakers finish the regular season with {{the best record in the}} Western Conference (57–25), with him in the starting lineup the Lakers went 22–5. Kobe Bryant has also stated that playing with Gasol clicked from the start.|$|E

This {{was the first time}} a Fox News anchor had moderated a general election presidential debate. After he was selected, Wallace controversially said, [...] "it's not my job" [...] to fact-check candidates, but that it was the job of the opposing candidate. But after the debate, Jennifer Rubin in The Washington Post said that despite her strong disapproval of other Fox News commentators, [...] "No one could watch the final debate and deny that <b>Chris</b> <b>Wallace</b> is {{among the best in the}} business." ...|$|E

50|$|Free throws can {{normally}} be {{shot at a}} high percentage by good players. In the NBA, most players make 70-80% of their attempts. The league's best shooters (such as Steve Nash, Rick Barry, Ray Allen, José Calderón, Stephen Curry, Reggie Miller, Kevin Durant, and Dirk Nowitzki) can make roughly 90% of their attempts over a season, while notoriously poor shooters (e.g. Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, Andre Drummond, Andris Biedrins, <b>Chris</b> Dudley, Ben <b>Wallace,</b> Shaquille O'Neal, and Dennis Rodman) may struggle to make 50% of them. During a foul shot, a player's foot must be completely behind the foul line. If a player lines up with part {{of his or her}} foot on the line, a violation is called and the shot doesn't count. Foul shots are worth one point.|$|R

Piz was named after {{the director of the}} pilot, Mark Piznarski. The character's role was to have another male friend for Veronica who was middle-class, and not upper-class.

Cindy [...] "Mac" [...] Mackenzie and Don Lamb, recurring characters in the first two seasons, were upgraded to series regulars.

Veronica goes to a photo-developing store and retrieves the photos, but one is stuck in the printer and Nasir gets it. Amira’s father shows up at her door and angrily berates her and fires Veronica, although she says that her real employer is his wife. Keith catches Wallace and Piz, out for {{a night on the}} town, in a bar, discovering that they have high-quality fake IDs from Veronica, leading Keith to reprimand her. Veronica discovers the true vandal after tracking a piece of bait.

Keith sends Piz (<b>Chris</b> Lowell) and <b>Wallace</b> (Percy Daggs III) with clearly fake IDs into a bar as a test of his subordinates.
