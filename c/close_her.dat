Some accounts (see Horace, below) say Hera forced Lamia to devour her own children.

25|$|The Meiers {{criticized the}} prosecutor's statements, saying that Banas did not {{interview}} any party {{other than the}} Drews and that Banas was solely relying on {{the testimony of the}} Drews. Banas said that the original FBI investigation into the matter, during which Grills was interviewed, established her role in the event. The Meiers have said they do not hold Grills responsible for Megan's death. Banas said Sarah Drew, by then 15, was attending a different school and not living in Dardenne Prairie. He said Lori Drew was fearful of telling him where her daughter lives. According to Lori Drew's attorney, she had to <b>close</b> <b>her</b> advertising business in the wake of publicity about her role in the Internet account and messages.

500|$|After {{flying to}} Australia in February 2014 {{to operate on}} her heel and knee, Jackson {{committed}} {{to return to the}} Opals in time for the 2014 FIBA World Championship for Women. However, the delayed recovery of Jackson's knee led her to give up on the tournament to have her right hip operated on to fix a torn labrum in September 2014. She had gotten the tear while playing for Ros Casares Valencia in 2012 but went without surgery to not miss the then-upcoming Olympics. Jackson would later express interest in attending her fifth Olympic tournament during the 2016 Summer Olympics as a way to <b>close</b> <b>her</b> career, while also pursuing her long-standing dream of a gold medal. However, while attending the Opals training camp in Canberra, she announced her retirement saying her conditions were not improved enough and she needed an [...] "absolute miracle" [...] to get into shape.|$|E
500|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. An armed British naval party had attempted to board Bremse and <b>close</b> <b>her</b> bottom valves, but found that they were already below the rising waterline. Instead they blasted off her anchor chains and she was taken in tow by a tug and the destroyer , {{in an attempt to}} beach her before she sank. They managed to run her bow onto the beach, south of Cava, but the steeply sloping approach meant that her stern settled in deeper water, and she rolled over and sank in [...] of water at 14:30, leaving her bow visible at low tide.|$|E
500|$|Scully goes to warn Fellig that he {{is about}} to be charged for murder, and accuses him of {{profiting}} from people's deaths. In his darkroom, Fellig shows Scully a photo of a dead woman with an odd fuzzy shape around her head, which the photographer claims is Death. When asked why he bothers to try to photograph Death, Fellig says that it is so he can look Death in the face and finally die. He claims to be 149 years old, and says he cannot kill himself. Scully points out that most people would like to live forever, but Fellig says that he has experienced everything, and that even love does not last forever. Suddenly, he notices that Scully is gray, and says, [...] "Count your blessings." [...] When she asks about the science of his immortality, he says he was meant to die of yellow fever, but he refused to look Death in the face, so instead Death took the kind nurse who had taken care of him. [...] Fellig takes a photo just as Ritter enters and shoots. The bullet passes right through the camera and through Fellig into Scully, who collapses. While Ritter rushes to call an ambulance, Fellig asks Scully whether she saw Death and begs her to <b>close</b> <b>her</b> eyes. He covers her hand with his own. The color returns to Scully's hand as Fellig's turns gray. Looking up, he dies.|$|E

2500|$|The gandharva Kali was in {{love with}} Varuthini and had been {{rejected}} by her in the past. He saw how she hungered for the Brahmin, so he took on the appearance of Pravara and came before the courtesan. He led her into the bedchamber and told her to <b>close</b> <b>her</b> eyes during their sex [...] [...] As they made love, Varuthini noticed that his body became flaming hot and believed it was because his Brahmin spirit was infused with the sacrificial fire. After climax, Kali, still-as-Pravara, left the apsara and returned to his abode. Varuthini soon became pregnant and nine months later gave birth to a human child that not only looked like the Brahmin but possessed his soul as well. The authors of the book Science in Culture comment this was an example of the Sanskrit phrase [...] "from his semen and from her thinking," [...] meaning the child was indeed Pravara's child because she believed it was his.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1974, {{some five}} hundred persons marched on City Hall to protest high utility bills in Minden. The dissidents were {{responding}} to the hastily formed Committee for Lower Utilities, headed by Steve Fomby, later {{a member of the}} Webster Parish School Board. Some complained that meter readers were staying in their trucks and estimating the readings. A convenience store owner said that if her excessive billing were repeated, she would have to <b>close</b> <b>her</b> doors. Electricity in Minden is sold by the municipality, which uses profits to finance a portion of city government costs. Colten and the city council did not attend the rally against the utility bills. Colten was on city business in Baton Rouge at the time but said he would have cancelled the trip had he known about the rally in advance. The utilities issue as well as the vacillation over full- and part-time status of the mayor are widely believed to have brought about the defeat of Colten. Several other city council members that year were also defeated, including Sanitation Commissioner Lonnie Lester [...] "Red" [...] Cupples (1914-1980) and Utilities Commissioner Fred T.
