50|$|Complexometric titrations {{rely on the}} {{formation}} of a complex between the analyte and the titrant. In general, they require specialized <b>complexometric</b> <b>indicators</b> that form weak complexes with the analyte. The most common example is the use of starch indicator to increase the sensitivity of iodometric titration, the dark blue complex of starch with iodine and iodide being more visible than iodine alone. Other <b>complexometric</b> <b>indicators</b> are Eriochrome Black T for the titration of calcium and magnesium ions, and the chelating agent EDTA used to titrate metal ions in solution.|$|R

50|$|In {{analytical}} chemistry, <b>complexometric</b> <b>indicators</b> {{are used}} in complexometric titration to indicate the exact moment when all the metal ions in the solution are sequestered by a chelating agent (most usually EDTA).

40|$|For {{the first}} time the {{considered}} unstable α,α-diformyldipyrrins are efficiently synthesized and isolated. These compounds and derivatives have proven to be extremely reliable and interesting <b>complexometric</b> <b>indicators</b> of a new generation. The preparation of the ligand by the condensation of the α,α-diformyldipyrrins with hydrazides, like semicarbazide, or other primary nitrogen compounds is very efficient. The high extinction coefficient (up to 10 ^ 5 L/mol/cm), the high binding constants (up to > 10 ^ 12 L/mol) and the shift of the absorbance (50 - 200 nm) enables the identification by UV/Vis spectroscopy at very low concentrations. In addition, the identification of many cations is possible with the naked eye. Another interesting feature is the selective coordination of cations among others weaker binding cations. The synthesized planar meso-alkyldipyrrins with three long chain alkyl groups were used for the studies on graphite surfaces. The dipyrrin structure allows changes in the geometry and could allow a switchable surface. With STM images this change is visible through a different surface structure. The different surface structures can be obtained by an irreversible rotation of both pyrroles by 180 °...|$|R
50|$|A pH {{indicator}} is a halochromic {{chemical compound}} added {{in small amounts}} to a solution so the pH (acidity or basicity) of the solution can be determined visually. Hence, a pH indicator is a chemical detector for hydronium ions (H3O+) or hydrogen ions (H+) in the Arrhenius model. Normally, the indicator causes {{the color of the}} solution to change depending on the pH. Indicators can also show change in other physical properties; for example, olfactory indicators show change in their odor. The pH value of a neutral solution is 7.0. Solutions with a pH value below 7.0 are considered acidic and solutions with pH value above 7.0 are basic (alkaline). As most naturally occurring organic compounds are weak protolytes, carboxylic acids and amines, pH indicators find many applications in biology and analytical chemistry. Moreover, pH indicators form one of the three main types of indicator compounds used in chemical analysis. For the quantitative analysis of metal cations, the use of <b>complexometric</b> <b>indicators</b> is preferred, whereas the third compound class, the redox indicators, are used in titrations involving a redox reaction as the basis of the analysis.|$|R
50|$|Bromopyrogallol red is {{commonly}} used in analytical chemistry as a spectrophotometric reagent and <b>complexometric</b> <b>indicator.</b> When metal ion complexation reactions are {{carried out in the}} presence of quaternary ammonium salts, the analytical possibilities with bromopyrogallol red are even greater. Doing this also increases the color contrast and sensitivity of many elements for analysis. In addition, bromopyrogallol red can also be widely used as a metallochromic indicator. Bromopyrogallol red {{has been used as a}} <b>complexometric</b> <b>indicator</b> for determination of Bi, Cd, Co, Mg, and Mn.|$|E
50|$|In some settings, {{when the}} titrated {{system is a}} redox system whose {{equilibrium}} {{is influenced by the}} removal of the metal ions, a redox indicator can function as a <b>complexometric</b> <b>indicator.</b>|$|E
50|$|Eriochrome Black T is a <b>complexometric</b> <b>indicator</b> {{that is used}} in complexometric titrations, e.g. in {{the water}} {{hardness}} determination process. It is an azo dye. Eriochrome is a trademark of Huntsman Petrochemical, LLC.|$|E
50|$|A <b>complexometric</b> <b>indicator</b> is an ionochromic dye that {{undergoes}} a definite color change in presence of specific metal ions. It forms a weak complex with the ions {{present in the}} solution, which has a significantly different color from the form existing outside the complex.Complexometric indicators are also known as pM indicators.|$|E
5000|$|Murexide {{is used in}} {{analytical}} chemistry as a <b>complexometric</b> <b>indicator</b> for complexometric titrations, most often of calcium ions, but also for , , , [...] and rare earth metals. Cf. Eriochrome Black T. Due to the minute amounts needed for this purpose, it is often used in a 1:250 mixture with potassium sulfate.|$|E
50|$|Calcein, {{also known}} as fluorexon, {{fluorescein}} complex, is a fluorescent dye with excitation and emission wavelengths of 495/515 nm, respectively, and has the appearance of orange crystals. Calcein self-quenches at concentrations above 70mM and is commonly used {{as an indicator of}} lipid vesicle leakage. It is also used traditionally as a <b>complexometric</b> <b>indicator</b> for titration of calcium ions with EDTA, and for fluorometric determination of calcium.|$|E
50|$|As a <b>complexometric</b> <b>indicator</b> for {{determination}} of : Bi, Cd, Co, Mg, Mn and rare earths, Bromopyrogallol red is not classified as harmful by ingestion. Direct contact with eye may cause tearing or conjunctive redness. It will also cause skin irritation; {{the entry of}} bromopyrogallol red into the blood stream may produce systemic injury. The material should also avoid contamination with oxidizing agents like nitrates, oxidizing acids, chlorine bleaches, pool chlorine etc.|$|E
50|$|To {{carry out}} metal cation titrations using EDTA, {{it is almost}} always {{necessary}} to use a <b>complexometric</b> <b>indicator</b> to determine when the end point has been reached. Common indicators are organic dyes such as Fast Sulphon Black, Eriochrome Black T, Eriochrome Red B, Patton Reeder, or Murexide. Color change shows that the indicator has been displaced (usually by EDTA) from the metal cations in solution when the end point has been reached. Thus, the free indicator (rather than the metal complex) serves as the endpoint indicator.|$|E
5000|$|Calmagite is a <b>complexometric</b> <b>indicator</b> used in {{analytical}} chemistry {{to identify the}} presence of metal ions in solution. As with other metal ion indicators calmagite will change color when it is bound to an ion. Calmagite will be wine red when it is bound to a metal ion and may be blue, red, or orange {{when it is not}} bound to a metal ion. Calmagite is often used in conjunction with EDTA, a stronger metal binding agent. [...] This chemical is also used in the quantitation of magnesium in the clinical laboratory.|$|E
