40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>cilazaprilat</b> were {{assessed}} on endothelium-dependent relaxations and contractions in isolated canine arteries. In coronary arteries incubated with indomethacin, <b>cilazaprilat</b> potentiated endothelium-dependent relaxations to bradykinin. In superfusion-perfusion bioassay studies with femoral arteries, <b>cilazaprilat</b> augmented {{the release of}} nonprostanoid endothelium-derived relaxing factors caused by bradykinin. To verify whether this effect was solely due to inhibition of the converting enzyme, the effects of <b>cilazaprilat</b> on responses {{to a variety of}} endothelium-dependent vasoactive agents were assessed. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine, thrombin, and vasopressin were not altered significantly by <b>cilazaprilat.</b> However, those induced by ADP and aggregating platelets were enhanced significantly by the compound. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to ADP-β-S were augmented significantly but to a lesser extent. Furthermore, {{in the presence of the}} nitric oxide synthase antagonist N(G) -nitro-L-arginine, ADP-β-S still caused small relaxations that were possibly mediated by endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. These relaxations were augmented by <b>cilazaprilat.</b> Thus, the augmentation of purinergic relaxations may involve an increased production of endothelium-derived relaxing factors in addition to the protection of ADP from breakdown. <b>Cilazaprilat</b> did not affect endothelium-dependent contractions to acetylcholine or the calcium ionophore A 23187 in canine basilar arteries, previously shown to be mediated by superoxide anions. Thus, <b>cilazaprilat</b> is not a scavenger of superoxide anion. Because this agent potentiates endothelium-dependent relaxations to bradykinin, ADP, and aggregating platelets, the present study suggests that, in addition to the lowering of plasmatic levels of angiotensin II, the antihypertensive and cardioprotective effects of <b>cilazaprilat</b> are mediated through an increased production of endothelium-derived relaxing factors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} effects of <b>cilazaprilat</b> in a {{concentration}} range of 10 nM to 1 mM were investigated on various Na+ and K+ transport systems in human red blood cells. <b>Cilazaprilat</b> inhibited the anion carrier or DIDS-sensitive LiCO 3 (-) -influx and the bumetanide-sensitive K(+) -efflux. However, no effect of <b>cilazaprilat</b> on the Na+, K(+) -pump activity, {{the number of}} active Na+ pump units and on the Na+, Li(+) -countertransport activity could be demonstrated. It is suggested that through a decreased anion carrier indicating a decreased Na(+) -influx, the lower intracellular Na+ concentration observed in vivo during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, can be at least partly explained. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background—Although ACE inhibitors {{can protect}} {{myocardium}} against ischemia/reperfusion injury, {{the mechanisms of}} this effect {{have not yet been}} characterized at the cellular level. The present study was designed to examine whether an ACE inhibitor, <b>cilazaprilat,</b> directly protects cardiac myocytes against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury. Methods and Results—Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in primary culture were exposed to hypoxia for 5. 5 hours and subsequently reoxygenated for 1 hour. Myocyte injury was determined by the release of creatine kinase (CK). Both <b>cilazaprilat</b> and bradykinin significantly inhibited CK release after H/R in a dose-dependent fashion and preserved myocyte ATP content during H/R, whereas CV- 11974, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, and angiotensin II did not. The protective effect of <b>cilazaprilat</b> was significantly inhibited by Hoe 140 (a bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist), NG-monomethyl-L-arginine monoacetate (L-NMMA) (an NO synthase inhibitor), and methylene blue (a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor) but not by staurosporine (a protein kinase C inhibitor), aminoguanidine (an inhibitor of inducible NO synthase), or indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor). <b>Cilazaprilat</b> significantly enhanced bradykinin production in the culture media of myocytes after 5. 5 hours of hypoxia but not in that of nonmyocytes. In addition, <b>cilazaprilat</b> markedly enhanced the cGMP content in myocytes during hypoxia, and this augmentation in cGMP could be blunted by L-NMMA and methylene blue but not by aminoguanidine. Conclusions—The present study demonstrates that <b>cilazaprilat</b> can directly protect myocytes against H/R injury, primarily {{as a result of an}} accumulation of bradykinin and the attendant production of NO induced by constitutive NO synthase in hypoxic myocytes in an autocrine/paracrine fashion. NO modulates guanylate cyclase and cGMP synthesis in myocytes, which may contribute to the preservation of energy metabolism and cardioprotection against H/R injury...|$|E
40|$|Time-sequential {{responses}} to endothelium-dependent and –independent vasodilators and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were {{studied in the}} subendocardial arterioles (ENDO) of canine renovascular hypertension compared with subepicardial arterioles (EPI, both < 120 µm) by CCD intravital microscope. Vascular {{responses to}} acetylcholine, papaverine and <b>cilazaprilat</b> were compared between normotension (N) and hypertension (4 wHT and 12 wHT). The acetylcholine-induced vasodilation of ENDO in both 4 wHT and 12 wHT was smaller than that of N (both P< 0. 01 vs. 4 wHT and 12 wHT), and that of EPI was smaller than that of N only in 12 wHT (P< 0. 05). The pavpaverine-induced vasodilation of ENDO, but not EPI, was impaired only in 12 wHT (both P< 0. 01 vs. N and 4 wHT). The vasodilation by <b>cilazaprilat</b> remained unchange...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the role of the}} endothelium and angiotensin II (Ang II) in regulating medial smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. [3 II]-thymidine incorporation into medial SMC of rat arteries was examined in vivo, using ballooned rat carotid arteries, as well as in vitro, using cultures of aortic tissue rings (organoids). In vivo, maximal medial [3 H]-thymidine incorporation occurred within 3 days post-ballooning. In endothelium-denuded organoids, maximum medial DNA synthesis was achieved after 7 days of culture. [3 H]-thymidine-labelling of SMC in intact organoids (with endothelium) increased minimally during culture, indicating that the endothelium provided protection with respect to medial proliferation under basal conditions (culture in the presence of 1 % plasma-derived serum). Inclusion of 10 − 7 M Ang-II significantly elevated medial [3 H] thymidine incorporation above that in control cultures. The stimulatory effect of Ang II was much more pronounced in intact organoids than in endothelium-denuded organoids, indicating synergistic growth regulation by Ang II and endothelium-derived factors. When organoids were cultured in the combined presence of Ang II and the ACE inhibitor <b>cilazaprilat,</b> labelling indices of intact organoids were also significantly increased above control, but to a lower level than those obtained in the presence of Ang II alone. However, for endothelium-denuded organoids, medial [3 H]-thymidine incorporation in the combined presence of Ang II and <b>cilazaprilat</b> was not significantly different from that in untreated controls. Thus, <b>cilazaprilat</b> exerts both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent negative regulatory effects on medial SMC proliferatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg of <b>cilazaprilat</b> administered intravenously {{were determined}} {{in a group}} of eight volunteers. The fall in plasma concentration was polyphasic. Elimination was predominantly by renal excretion of the unchanged drug. The mean renal clearance values following 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg doses were 5. 3 +/- 0. 5, 8. 1 +/- 0. 5, and 9. 8 +/- 0. 5 l h- 1 and plasma clearances were 7. 8 +/- 0. 5, 10. 4 +/- 0. 5 and 11. 8 +/- 0. 6 l h- 1, respectively. Thus, plasma and renal clearances were dose dependent. ACE inhibition was greater than 82 % for the first 4 h and about 55 % at 24 h, after all three doses. There were no significant haemodynamic effects at any dose...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), {{retained}} in the microvascular bed, can contribute to postischemic myocardial reperfusion injury. Since a beneficial effect of ACE-inhibition on reperfusion injury has been reported, we investigated the impact of <b>cilazaprilat</b> on PMN dependent reperfusion injury in isolated guinea pig hearts. Methods: Hearts (n= 5 per group) were subjected to 15 min of ischemia. Immediately thereafter, a bolus of PMN was injected into the coronary system. External heart work (EHW) and total cardiac nitric oxide release were measured. For microscopic evaluation, hearts received rhodamine 6 G labelled PMN after ischemia, were arrested 5 min later and further perfused with FITC dextran (0. 1 %). Localization of retained PMN was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Leukocyte activation was studied by FACS analysis of the adhesion molecule CD 11 b before and after coronary passage of the PMN. The ACE-inhibitor <b>cilazaprilat</b> (Cila, 2 μM) and the NO-synthase inhibitor nitro-L-arginine (NOLAG, 10 μM) were used to modulate nitric oxide formation of the heart. Results: Postischemic EHW recovered to 67 ± 5 % (controls) and 64 ± 6 % (Cila) of the preischemic value. Addition of PMN severely depressed recovery of EHW (39 ± 2 %) and NO release (39 ± 6 % of the preischemic value). Simultaneously, ischemia led to {{a substantial increase in}} postcapillary PMN adhesion (from 21 ± 5 to 172 ± 27 PMN/mm² surface) and CD 11 b-expression of the recovered PMN (3 -fold). Cila attenuated postischemic PMN adhesion (83 ± 52 PMN/mm²) and activation of PMN, whereas it improved recovery of work performance (64 ± 4 %) and NO release (65 ± 4 %) in the presence of PMN. Conversely, NOLAG increased PMN adhesion (284 ± 40 PMN/mm²) and myocardial injury. We conclude that ACE-inhibition prevents leukocyte dependent reperfusion injury mainly by inhibition of postcapillary leukocyte adhesion. The effect may be mediated by NO, given the proadhesive effect of NOLAG. ...|$|E
40|$|Several inhibitors of {{angiotensin}} converting enzyme were also found to inhibit aminopeptidase P, whereas inhibitors of other mammalian aminopeptidases were ineffective. Aminopeptidase P purified from pig kidney cortex was found to contain one atom of zinc per polypeptide chain, confirming its metalloenzyme nature. The concentrations of converting enzyme inhibitors required to cause 50 % inhibition (I 50) of aminopeptidase P were in the low micromolar range. The most potent converting enzyme inhibitors toward aminopeptidase P were the carboxylalkyl compounds, <b>cilazaprilat,</b> enalaprilat, and ramiprilat (I 50 values of 3 - 12 /iM). The sulfydryl compounds captopril (l 50 110 /iM) and YS 980 (I 50 20 /iM) were slightly less potent at inhibiting aminopeptidase P. In contrast, the carboxylalkyl compounds benazeprilat, lisinopril, and pentoprilat; the sulfydryl compound rentiapril; and the phosphoryl compounds ceranopril and fosinoprilat had no inhibitory effect against aminopeptidase P. This compares with I 50 values in the 1 - 6 nM range for these inhibitors with {{angiotensin converting}} enzyme. Inhibition of aminopeptidase P may account {{for some of the}} effects or side effects noted with the clinical use of converting enzyme inhibitors. These results may provide the basis for the design of more selective inhibitors of {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} or mixed inhibitors of aminopeptidase P and angiotensin converting enzyme, or both.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} for hepatic uptake of temocaprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that is predominantly excreted into bile was studied using isolated rat hepatocytes and COS- 7 cells expressing the organic anion transporting polypeptide (oatp 1). The uptake of temocaprilat into isolated rat hepatocytes exhibited saturation with a Km of 20. 9 microM and a Vmax of 0. 21 nmol/min/mg protein. This uptake was temperature sensitive and was significantly reduced by metabolic inhibitors, a sulfhydryl-modifying reagent and an anion-exchange inhibitor, although {{the replacement of}} Na+ with Li+ in the medium {{did not affect the}} uptake. [3 H]Temocaprilat uptake was inhibited by estradiol- 17 beta-D-glucuronide and dibromosulphophthalein, typical substrates for the Na+-independent organic anion transporter, in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas excess estradiol- 17 beta-D-glucuronide did not completely inhibit the uptake. Temocaprilat uptake into COS- 7 cells transfected with oatp 1 cDNA revealed a concentration-dependency with a Km of 46. 7 microM, a value comparable with that obtained in isolated hepatocytes. The contribution of oatp 1 to carrier-mediated hepatic uptake of temocaprilat was less than 50 % by correcting the uptake clearance with that of estradiol- 17 beta-D-glucuronide. A good linear correlation was observed for the inhibitory effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (benazeprilat, <b>cilazaprilat,</b> delaprilat and enalaprilat) between isolated hepatocytes and oatp 1 -expressing cells. These data suggest that oatp 1, along with another transporter(s), mediates the uptake of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors into rat hepatocytes...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{designed}} to investigate the mechanisms underlying the augmentation by angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors of the endothelium-dependent relaxations evoked by bradykinin. Isometric tension, tissue levels of cGMP, and transmembrane potential were measured in isolated canine coronary arteries as indications of the respective contribution of nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. In rings of coronary artery with endothelium, relaxations to bradykinin were potentiated by the ACE inhibitors <b>cilazaprilat</b> and perindoprilat. N(G) -Nitro-L-arginine (NLA), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, impaired relaxations to bradykinin. But the presence of ACE inhibitors partially restored this activity. Bradykinin stimulated the production of cGMP, and this was enhanced significantly by ACE inhibitors, indicating an augmented release of nitric oxide. NLA abolished the increase induced by bradykinin irrespective {{of the presence of}} ACE inhibitors. Electrophysiological studies revealed that bradykinin elicited an endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle that was insensitive to NLA and potentiated by ACE inhibitors. The bradykinin-induced hyperpolarization and NLA-resistant relaxations were transient and impaired by potassium depolarization. Thus, production of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor may account for the NLA-resistant relaxations of canine coronary arteries. The relaxations induced by bradykinin were unaffected by the B 1 kinin receptor antagonist des- Arg 9,[Leu 8]-bradykinin either in the absence or in the presence of NLA but were antagonized by the B 2 kinin receptor antagonist D-Arg[Hyp 3,D-Phe 7]- bradykinin. Molecular exclusion chromatography of 125 I-labeled [Tyr 8]- bradykinin and its degradation products demonstrated that the breakdown of the kinin by isolated coronary arteries was prevented in the presence of perindoprilat. The experiments suggest that the potentiating effect of ACE inhibitors on relaxations evoked by bradykinin involves the protection of bradykinin from breakdown by ACE, which results in greater production of endothelium-derived nitric oxide and hyperpolarizing factor, via stimulation of endothelial B 2 kinin receptors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Cilazapril, a moisture-sensitive compound, {{is known}} to undergo rapid {{degradation}} which could be additionally facilitated {{by the presence of}} excipients that contain or absorb moisture. Hence we investigated the stability of cilazapril in two commercially-available dosage forms and in binary mixtures with the selected excipients used in the studied commercial formulations i. e. : hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, maize starch and talc in order to detect any possible, stability-affecting incompatibilities. Also the impact of the blister made of oriented polyamide/aluminum/polyvinyl chloride//aluminum on cilazapril-containing tablets was researched. A validated HPLC and HPLC-MS methods were used for analysis and the isothermal stress testing conditions were applied (temperature range 318 – 343  K, relative humidity 76. 4 % for tablets and temperature 333  K, relative humidity range 50. 9 – 76. 4 % for binary mixtures). It was shown that the degradation of cilazapril in both, model mixtures and tablets follows the autocatalytic model kinetics and it is more rapid than that observed for pure substance, evidenced by higher degradation rate constants. The immediate packaging protects cilazapril in tablets from degradation only in case of the original drug while in its blistered generic counterpart a slight but statistically insignificant increase of cilazapril decay occurs when compared to bare tablets (p <  0. 05). The degradation product of cilazapril in tablets and binary mixtures was identified as <b>cilazaprilat.</b> It was also observed that the increase of relative humidity or the presence of hypromellose, lactose and talc significantly impairs the stability of cilazapril in the aforementioned order. Only maize starch exhibited a positive effect on cilazapril stability (10. 8 % loss of cilazapril in binary mixture after 360  days of stressing compared to 35 % loss of pure cilazapril in analogous test conditions) probably thanks to its moisture-scavenging properties. It was suggested that in the manufacture of cilazapril-containing solid dosage forms the procedure of wet granulation should be avoided while hygroscopic excipients should be substituted by their non-hygroscopic counterparts...|$|E
