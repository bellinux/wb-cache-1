5000|$|The {{red-chested cuckoo}} (<b>Cuculus</b> <b>solitarius)</b> is {{a species of}} cuckoo in the family Cuculidae. It is a {{medium-sized}} bird found in Africa south of the Sahara. In Afrikaans, it is known as [...] "Piet-my-vrou", after its call.|$|E
50|$|The African {{pied wagtail}} is monogamous, the {{cup-shaped}} nest {{is lined with}} grass and feathers and is usually situated near water in a convenient tangle of sticks. In settlements the nest may be located on buildings. The nests of the African pied wagtail are parasitised by the red-chested cuckoo <b>Cuculus</b> <b>solitarius</b> and the diderick cuckoo Chrysococcyx caprius. While chicks have been recorded as prey of Burchell's coucal Centropus burchellii.|$|E
50|$|Breeding {{takes place}} in the spring, principally in October and November. The nest is usually on or near the ground, in a hollow stump, near the root of a vine or in a {{discarded}} utensil. It is cup-shaped and composed of twigs, dry grasses and leaves and lined with rootlets, tendrils, stalks and fragments of leaves. There are usually two or three eggs and the incubation is done solely by the hen bird and lasts fourteen to fifteen days. Both parents feed the chicks, which leave the nest after about a fortnight but remain dependent on the adults for another six or seven weeks.

40|$|The {{hydrological}} disasters facing Swaziland include persistent drought, erratic rains, occasional {{floods and}} devastating lightning during rainy seasons. The {{purpose of the}} study was to document indigenous knowledge systems that were applicable in hydrological disaster management in Swaziland. Information on indigenous methods that were used to manage hydrological disasters was collected from review of literature and focus group discussions that were conducted at Ntndozi area in Swaziland. A variety of methods were employed to predict weather, based mainly on environmental cues and behavior of animals. The nesting position of the Ploceus spp bird was used for prediction of floods. The cry of <b>Cuculus</b> <b>solitarius</b> bird signaled the start of the wet season between the period of August and November, and farmers started assembling their farming inputs upon hearing its cry. The abundance of butterflies, locusts and grasshoppers during farming season was taken as a sign of imminent drought. Indigenous methods used to prevent natural disasters included taking refuge under the Kigelia africana tree during lightning. It was believed that the tree is immune from lightning strikes. One was to avoid sitting under certain trees during lightning as they were known to be prone to lightning. They include Sclerocarya birrea, Ficus africana and Vangueria esculenta. The mitigation and coping mechanisms for hydrological disasters included traditional methods of storing food during periods of good harvests, selection of crops that were tolerant to drought and the use of indigenous fruits and vegetables...|$|E
