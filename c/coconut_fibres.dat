The aim was to assess the potential of these composite materials for the relief-printing plates as an alternative to classical photopolymer materials. Differential scanning calorimetry, surface free energy calculations and hardness measurements were performed on the samples. Results have shown that most thermal transitions that are characteristic for PLA and PCL do not take place in the area of temperatures applicable in the printing process. Most thermal transitions were not affected by the addition of <b>coconut</b> <b>fibres.</b> <b>Coconut</b> <b>fibres</b> in the composite structure contributed to the increased hardness of the material. Moreover, the hardness range of the prepared PCL/PLA composites was within the range of some classic photopolymer printing plates.

40|$|Foamed {{concrete}} is {{a controlled}} low density ranging from 400 kg/m 3 to 1800 kg/m 3, and hence {{suitable for the}} construction of buildings and infrastructures. The uniqueness of foamed concrete is does not use aggregates in order to retain low density. Foamed concrete contains only cement, sand, water and foam agent. Therefore, the consumption of cement is higher in producing a good quality and strength of foamed concrete. Without the present of aggregates, the compressive strength of foamed concrete can only achieve as high as 15 MPa. Therefore, this study aims to introduce the pelletized <b>coconut</b> <b>fibre</b> aggregate to reduce the consumption of cement but able to enhance the compressive strength.

Therefore, the industry has seen various types of concrete in which fine aggregate and coarse aggregate are replaced waste foundry sand, stone dust, crumb rubber etc. and supplementary cementitious materials such as fly ash, silica fume, metakaolin, rice husk ash etc., are used to minimize the use of cement.

Therefore, reinforcing strategies must be considered to increase the mechanical performance, especially when high content of cork powder is added to the formulation. <b>Coconut</b> <b>fibres</b> have several advantages, such as, low density, renewable source, low cost and biodegradability. The use of these fibres on the reinforcement of CPC materials will not only contribute to improve the mechanical performance but also for increasing the amount of natural component present on the final composition. The main goal of this work was to prepare HDPE/cork (50 - 50 wt. %) composites reinforced with discontinuous <b>coconut</b> <b>fibres</b> (5 and 10 wt. %) with and without the addition of coupling agent (2 wt. %) by extrusion. The developed reinforced cork based composites were characterized regarding its morphology and mechanical performance. Optical micrographs have shown a homogeneous distribution of the fibres. The coupling agent effect on CPC performance was also investigated. The tensile strength and tensile modulus of the reinforced composites were significantly improved with the addition of coupling agent. The use of 10 wt. % of <b>coconut</b> <b>fibres</b> in the presence of coupling agent promote an increase on maximum tensile strength of around 41 % comparing with the HDPE/cork (50 - 50 wt. %) composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the tensile fractured specimens confirmed that the use of coupling agent promoted the interfacial adhesion between the fibres and the thermoplastic matrix.
