40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a methodology for <b>coarse</b> <b>position</b> estimation of a mobile robot within an indoor setting. The approach {{is divided into}} two phases: exploration and navigation. In the exploration phase, the mobile robot is allowed to sense the environment for the purpose of mapping and thus "learning" its unknown surroundings. In the navigation phase, the robot senses the surroundings and compares this information with its learned maps for the purpose of locating itself in the workspace. We solve the task of coarse-level mobile robot localization via pattern classification of grid-based maps of important or interesting workspace regions. Using datasets representing 10 different rooms and doorways, we estimate a 94 % recognition rate of the rooms and a 98 % recognition rate of the doorways. We conclude that <b>coarse</b> <b>position</b> estimation is possible through classification of grid-based maps in indoor [...] ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} neural {{model for the}} visual {{processing}} of transient actions {{that is consistent with}} physiological data and that accomplishes recognition of grasping actions from real video stimuli. Shape recognition is accomplished by a view-dependent hierarchical neural architecture that retains some <b>coarse</b> <b>position</b> information on the highest level that can be exploited by subsequent stages. Additionally, simple recurrent neural circuits integrate effector information over time and realize selectivity for temporal sequences. A novel mechanism combines information about the shape and position of object and effector in an object-centered frame of reference. Action-selective model neurons defined in such a relative reference frame are tuned to learned associations between object and effector shapes, as well as their relative position and motion. |$|E

We are able to show a 96 % detection and identification of 5 individual doorways and an 86 % recognition rate of 22 separate approach angles and translations. We conclude that pattern recognition using features obtained from simple constrained infrared ranging sensor data binning can be utilized for fast identification of doorways, and important <b>coarse</b> <b>position</b> and approach angle determination, suitable for real-time trajectory adjustment, representing a significant enhancement in this area...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for pupil localization in multi-view eyeballs under ordinary light conditions. There are two key steps. The first step is eye detection, which is obtained by facial key points using Active Shape Mode. Face detection {{is also used to}} provide the initial search area and enhance the searching speed for facial key points. The second step is the pupil localization process. In this stage, eye gray distribution obtained by sliding window technique is used to provide the <b>coarse</b> <b>position</b> of pupil, and similar local area analysis method is employed to provide pupil's fine position. A set of experiments on different eyeball positions are also presented. The experimental results show that the proposed method can perform well when the eye keeps normal and narrowed slightly, or gazes left, right and up. While the eye looks down, the localization effect needs to be improved further...|$|E

3000|$|The {{result of}} <b>coarse</b> <b>positioning</b> with Hausdorff-based RC is showed in Figure 5 (a). It {{indicates}} that the resulted trajectory is still parallel with the output one by INS. And the yawing error remains nonignorable. Next, the measurement sequence is modified by setting its initial value equal with the first one of the resulted sequence after <b>coarse</b> <b>positioning.</b> Then IESIL is executed {{and the result of}} fine positioning is demonstrated in Figure 5 (b), and it approximates the real trajectory with deviation less than 1 grid interval. The results of Hausdorff-based RC and IESIL both lie in the [...] "hunting window". From Figure 5 (a) to Figure 5 (b), the validity of the combination algorithm can be explicitly judged by the spatial relationships between the coarsely resulted track, fine-resulted track, INS track, and real track. IESIL-resulted fine track is more close to the real track than to RC-resulted coarse track, and both are better than the INS track. The rectifying effect for INS's drift is very obvious. The comparison basically confirms the anticipation that the combination algorithm can supply a more effective method for UMN.|$|R

A second method was developed which utilizes IUE's ability to track the sun with a solid state two-dimensional sun sensor. Attitude determination can now be completed in several hours.

40|$|RSS-based device-free {{localization}} (DFL) is a {{very promising}} technique which allows localizing the target without attaching any electronic tags in wireless environments. In cluttered indoor environments, the performance of DFL degrades due to multipath interference. In this paper, we propose a multichannel obstructed link detection method based on the RSS variation on difference channels. Multichannel detection is proved to be very effective in multipath environments compared to the single channel detection. We also propose a new localization method termed as robust weighted least square (RWLS) method. RWLS first use spatial property to eliminate the interference links and then employ WLS method to localize the target. Since the spatial detection relies on the unknown position of the target. A <b>coarse</b> <b>position</b> estimation of target is also presented. RWLS is robust to interference links and has low computation complexity.

40|$|We {{consider}} a robot equipped only with simple range sensing that must move and navigate within an initially unfamiliar environment. The robot is not given {{a map of}} the environment and constructs one dynamically. This map is not meant to represent the actual spatial structure of the environment so much as it is meant to represent the major structural components of what the robot "sees". The problem with such an approach is that maintaining an absolute coordinate systems for the map is difficult. We demonstrate that in a suitable environment it is possible to use sonar data to recalibrate position estimates on an ongoing basis. This is accomplished by incrementally constructing and updating a model-based description of the acquired data. Given <b>coarse</b> <b>position</b> estimates of the robot's location, these can be effectively refined to high accuracy using the stored map. Experimental data are presented indicating when this can and cannot be accomplished...|$|E
40|$|Image based {{localization}} is {{an important}} problem with many applications. The basic idea is to match a user generated query image against a database of geo-tagged images with known {{6 degrees of freedom}} poses. Once this retrieval problem is solved, it is possible to recover the pose of the query image. A challenging problem in image retrieval is performance degradation as the size of the image database grows. In this paper we describe an approach to large scale image retrieval for user localization in urban environment by taking advantage of <b>coarse</b> <b>position</b> estimates available, e. g. via cell tower triangulation, on many mobile devices today.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in the beginning, MNOs capture various kinds of events in their core network that allow to deduce, e.g., if a particular mobile terminal is in idle or connected mode or his <b>coarse</b> <b>position</b> at cell coverage level. Furthermore, these events {{can be used to}} distinguish between speech and data users, as different events are issued for the respective connection types. These HO events (or LAU events in case the mobile terminal is in idle mode) can be used in order to infer the subscriber’s mobility behavior in terms of a movement trajectory, as outlined in the previous sections. For the reason of reproducible mobility situations in cellular real-network simulations at system level, the modeling and simulation of network traffic is an important aspect. In our work we do not focus on particular traffic models (examples are given in [22 – 24]); instead, we offer a generic solution that allows to estimate when a speech or data session started and ended, both in a time, and spatial dimension. The actual traffic model to be applied at a later point in time is freely selectable, which adds additional flexibility to the simulations to be performed.|$|E

40|$|A popular {{approach}} to nano-positioning requirements in precision engineering {{in general and}} micro-lithography in particular is to subdivide the stage positioning architecture into a <b>coarse</b> <b>positioning</b> module with micrometer accuracy (Long Stroke), onto which a fine positioning module (Short Stroke) is cascaded. The latter is responsible for correcting the residual error of the <b>coarse</b> <b>positioning</b> module to the last nanometers. High accuracy positioning in 6 Degrees Of Freedom put severe constraints on the actuators and/or bearing systems. Actuators are used for generating a varying force {{being part of a}} control loop. Bearing systems should generate a force as constant as possible in the bearing direction, but the force perpendicular to that direction should be as low as possible. Actuators could serve as a bearing system, but on the one hand this would require the actuators to be large and thus heavy {{and on the other hand}} a substantial amount of heat is continuously dissipated in order to generate the static forces. Such heat generation does not contribute to the positioning performance of the actuators, but significantly affects the thermal stability of the application. The latter implication will be overcome if the bearing system is established by a system with permanent magnets...|$|R
