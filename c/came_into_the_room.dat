25|$|The meeting {{took place}} on 19 July in the villa of Senator Achille Gaggia in Feltre, near Belluno. There Mussolini, Bastianini and Ambrosio met with Hitler and the generals of the OKW to discuss the {{situation}} and the possible countermeasures. The German delegation was full of generals, but neither Goering nor Ribbentrop were present, showing that the Germans were focusing on the military aspects of the situation. Ambrosio prepared for the meeting meticulously, and the day before spoke plainly to Mussolini, telling him that his duty was to exit {{the war in the}} next 15 days. The Germans, on the other hand, had lost faith in the Italians and were only interested in occupying northern and central Italy, leaving the Italian army alone to defend the country from the Allies. Moreover, they proposed that the Axis supreme command in the peninsula be taken over by a German general (possibly Rommel). The first two hours of the meeting were as usual a monologue by Hitler, blaming the Italians for their weak military performance and asking for draconian measures: Mussolini was unable to speak a word. The meeting was suddenly interrupted when an Italian aide <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and told Mussolini that at that moment the Allies were for the first time heavily bombing Rome. During the lunch pause, Ambrosio and Bastianini pressed the Duce to tell Hitler that for Italy a political solution to the war was necessary, but Mussolini replied that he had been tormented for months by the dilemma of leaving the alliance or continuing the war: in reality, Mussolini could not overcome the sense of inferiority he felt in the presence of Hitler , and did not have the courage to speak frankly with his German colleague.|$|E
2500|$|Michael's mother, Valerie Glassborow (1924–2006) {{worked at}} the Second World War Government Code and Cypher School (GC) in Bletchley Park, along with her twin sister, Mary. Codebreaking {{penetrated}} the secret communications of the Axis Powersmost importantly the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers and is {{the birthplace of the}} world's first programmable, digital, electronic computer: Colossus. Her Bletchley Park colleague and friend, Lady Body (née Marion Graham), recalled in 2014 that she had shared a [...] "rather special moment" [...] with Valerie: [...] "Our superior officer, Commander Williams, <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> smiling and he said, ‘Well done, girls. A signal has been intercepted from Tokyo to Geneva and it's the signal that the Japanese are surrendering'. He told us that a message has gone to the King and the Prime Minister but that it could not be announced until Geneva has sent on the message to London." ...|$|E
2500|$|So I went {{to lunch}} with [...] George Kennan and Erwin Panofsky {{and the great}} Plato scholar Harold Cherniss. Afterwards Cherniss invited me to his {{beautiful}} office and, as we started chatting, Oppenheimer <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{and sat on the}} table behind us. This {{is one of the most}} cruel, brilliant tricks: it makes you master of the situation, and the people who can't see you as you speak to them are completely helpless. Oppenheimer's mastery of these histrionic moves was incredible. Cherniss was showing me how he was editing a passage of Plato with a lacuna, and trying to fill it. When Oppenheimer asked me what I would do with such a passage, I began stumbling, and he said, “Well that's very stupid. A great text should have blanks.” There I happily lost my temper: “Of all the pompous clichés,” I said. “First of all, that's a quote from Mallarmé, as you, sir, must know. Secondly, it's the kind of paradox you could play with till the cows come home. But when you're asked to do an edition of a Plato text for us ordinary human beings, I am most grateful if the blanks are filled.” Oppenheimer fought back superbly. He said, “No, precisely in philosophy you should know more than in poetry. It is the implicit missing that stimulates the argument.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, {{during the}} casting period in 1984, Taylforth auditioned {{for the role}} of Sue Osman. She was {{unsuccessful}} and that part went to Sandy Ratcliff, however, Holland and Smith asked her back to audition for another role, the part of Kathy. Smith and Holland have commented that [...] "she <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> bringing the whole of the 'East-end' in with her [...] In exactly half a minute she'd charmed the pants off them". She was considered perfect, apart from her age. Smith and Holland have commented in their book Inside Story that [...] " [...] was too young! They had said so from the beginning. By rights, they should not even be interviewing her. But wasn't she perfect, apart from her age? So different from any other 'Kathy' they had seen. Fresher. More down to earth. Ages were discussed and a pocket-calculator produced. If Pete Beale had been her first boyfriend, wasn't it just possible that she could have a fourteen-year-old son? Julia and Tony were trying to talk themselves into it." [...] Taylforth has commented on the audition process, [...] " [...] whipped out a calculator and kept punching in numbers. 'We're trying to work out if you could be old enough to be Ian's Mum,' they said. I said, 'I can look older. I'll put my hair up. I'll have a few late nights and I promise I'll look old enough to be Ian's Mum'." [...] According to Holland and Smith, Gillian Taylforth's [...] "freshness and earthy charm" [...] won them around and she was offered the part of Kathy.|$|E
