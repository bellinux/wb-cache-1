2500|$|While {{rights to}} take {{collective}} action, including strikes, are fundamental to democratic and civilised society, the UK {{has introduced a}} growing menu of collective rights to have a [...] "voice at work" [...] without a need for protest. [...] "Information and consultation" [...] are usually seen as precursors to actual participation rights, through binding votes at work. The economic benefit is that directors or decision-makers who inform and consult staff on important workplace changes (e.g. redundancies) think harder, and see alternatives with fewer costs for the enterprise, taxpayers, and staff. Information and consultation rights have historically derived from collective bargaining models. The Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 sections 181-182 require employers on a union's written request to disclose information, without which collective bargaining could be materially impeded, according to [...] "good industrial relations practice". The Companies Act 2006 section 417-419 also requires disclosure of information in a director's report each financial year on how companies [...] "have regard" [...] to [...] "the interests of the company’s employees" [...] and [...] "business relationships with suppliers" [...] down the supply chain. General consultation rights existed in the UK with collective bargaining since the Whitley Councils from 1918. A general consultation right is now codified in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, article 27. The Court of Justice held this was not directly binding, but specific rules apply in four main contexts: in general work councils, transnational work councils, for <b>collective</b> <b>redundancies,</b> transfers of undertakings, and health and safety.|$|E
2500|$|Since the Bankruptcy Act 1542 a key {{principle}} of insolvency {{law has been}} that losses are shared among creditors proportionately. Creditors who fall into the same class will share proportionally in the losses (e.g. each creditor gets 50 pence for each £1 she is owed). However, this pari passu principle only operates among creditors within the strict categories of priority set by the law. First, the law permits creditors making contracts with a company before insolvency to take a security interest over a company's property. If the security is refers to some specific asset, the holder of this [...] "fixed charge" [...] may take the asset away free from anybody else's interest {{in order to satisfy}} the debt. If two charges are created over the same property, the charge holder with the first will have the first access. Second, the Insolvency Act 1986 section 176ZA gives special priority to all the fees and expenses of the insolvency practitioner, who carries out an administration or winding up. The practitioner's expenses will include the wages due on any employment contract that the practitioner chooses to adopt. But controversially, the Court of Appeal in Krasner v McMath held this would not include the statutory requirement to pay compensation for a management's failure to consult upon <b>collective</b> <b>redundancies.</b> Third, even if they are not retained, employees' wages up to £800 and sums due into employees' pensions, are to be paid under section 175. Fourth, {{a certain amount of money}} must be set aside as a [...] "ring fenced fund" [...] for all creditors without security under section 176A. This is set by statutory instrument as a maximum of £600,000, or 20 per cent of the remaining value, or 50 per cent of the value of anything under £10,000. All these preferential categories (for insolvency practitioners, employees, and a limited amount for unsecured creditors) come in priority to the holder of a floating charge.|$|E
2500|$|The {{right to}} secure employment, either in one's current job or {{in a job}} that utilises a person's skills in the most {{socially}} productive way, is usually seen as crucial {{for the success of}} the economy and human development. The aim is to counterbalance the destructive effect on productivity and social costs that come from abuse of managerial power. Consistent with minimal international standards, employees in the United Kingdom have three principal job security rights, introduced originally by the Contracts of Employment Act 1963, the Redundancy Payments Act 1965 and the Industrial Relations Act 1971. First, after one month's work an employee must have at least one week's notice before any dismissal, unless there has been gross misconduct. This minimum rises to two weeks after two years, three weeks after three years, and so on, up to twelve weeks after twelve years. Second, after two years' work, the dismissal must be fair. This means the employer must have a justification based on an employee's capability, conduct, redundancy or another good reason, or the employee can claim damages or the job back from an Employment Tribunal. Third, also after two years' work and if dismissed because the enterprise no longer needs someone doing the employee's job, there is a right to a redundancy payment. Like the notice period, redundancy pay increases according to the number of years worked. Contracts should usually go beyond this bare minimum, but cannot go below. Compared to its European and Commonwealth counterparts, jobs in the UK are relatively insecure. Workers have few ways, except pressure through collective bargaining, to challenge a management's decision about dismissals before they take place. When <b>collective</b> <b>redundancies</b> are proposed, however, EU law has introduced a requirement that employers consult on changes. EU law also introduced a rule that if a business is transferred, for instance, during a merger or acquisition, employees may not have their terms worsened or lose their jobs without a good economic, technical or organisational reason. If employees do lose their work, they may fall back on a minimal system of state insurance, funded primarily through income tax or National Insurance, to collect a [...] "jobseekers allowance", and may make use of public employment agencies to find employment again. The UK government has in the past aimed to create [...] "full employment" [...] however this goal has not necessarily translated into secure and stable work.|$|E

Purpose: This paper aims {{to examine}} the more militant {{response}} of a minority of workers to <b>collective</b> <b>redundancy</b> and restructuring in Britain since 2007. Design/methodology/approach: The paper deploys secondary sources to develop a series of grounded micro-factors to help explain the presence and absence of the deployment of the occupation tactic. Findings: Some headway is made in explaining why {{only a limited number}} of occupations took place against redundancy and restructuring. Practical implications: The method of occupation was not shown to be as effective as might have been thought in opposing redundancies. Social implications: These concern union strategies and tactics for resistance to redundancy and restructuring. Originality/value: The paper provides a grounded explanation of the phenomenon and incidence of worker occupations against <b>collective</b> <b>redundancy</b> and closure. ??

50|$|The <b>Collective</b> <b>Redundancy</b> (Notification) Act of 1976 imposed an {{obligation}} on employers (who intend to collectively dismiss employees) “to give written notice of this intention to the relevant trade unions for consultation,” while {{that same year}} consultative works councils were replaced by powerful ones modelled after the German works councils. Also in 1976, a law was passed forbidding dismissal upon pregnancy or marriage for all women.|$|R
2500|$|Third, the EU is {{formally}} {{not enabled}} to legislate on collective bargaining, although the EU, with all member states, is {{bound by the}} jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on freedom of association. In Wilson and Palmer v United Kingdom the Court held that any detriment for membership of a trade union was incompatible with article 11, and in Demir and Baykara v Turkey the Court held [...] "the right to bargain collectively with the employer has, in principle, {{become one of the}} essential elements" [...] of article 11. This approach, which includes affirmation of the fundamental right to strike in all democratic member states, has been seen as lying in tension with some of the Court of Justice's previous case law, notably ITWF v Viking Line ABP and Laval Un Partneri Ltd v Svenska Byggnadsarbetareforbundet. These controversial decisions, quickly disapproved by legislative measures, suggested the fundamental right of workers to take collective action was subordinate to business freedom to establish and provide services. More positively, the Information and Consultation Directive 2002 requires that workplaces with over 20 or 50 staff have the right to set up elected work councils with a range of binding rights, the European Works Council Directive 2009 enables work councils transnationally, and the Employee Involvement Directive 2001 requires representation of workers on company boards in some European Companies. If a company transforms from a member state corporation to incorporate under the European Company Regulation 2001, employees are entitled to no less favourable representation than under the member state's existing board participation laws. This is practically important as a majority of EU member states require employee representation on company boards. Fourth, minimum job security rights are provided by three Directives. The <b>Collective</b> <b>Redundancies</b> Directive 1998 specifies that minimum periods of notice and consultation occur if more than a set number of jobs in a workplace are at risk. The Transfers of Undertakings Directive 2001 require that staff retain all contractual rights, unless there is an independent economic, technical or organisational reason, if their workplace is sold from one company to another. Last, the Insolvency Protection Directive 2008 requires that employees' wage claims are protected in the event that their employer falls insolvent. This last Directive gave rise to Francovich v Italy, where the Court of Justice affirmed that member states which fail to implement the minimum standards in EU Directives are liable to pay compensation to employees who should have rights under them.|$|E
2500|$|Third, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 section 188 {{requires}} employers, who are [...] "contemplating" [...] redundancies of 20 employees, in an [...] "establishment" [...] over 90 days, {{to consult}} for 30 {{days with the}} workforce. [...] "Redundancy" [...] is an economic dismissal [...] "not related to the individual concerned" [...] (e.g. for poor work or misconduct). In University of Stirling v UCU the Supreme Court held that expiry of fixed term contracts, for 140 University teaching staff, did not count as a reason [...] "related to the individual", and so staff should have been consulted. An [...] "establishment" [...] includes [...] "a distinct entity that is ordinarily permanent, entrusted with performing specified tasks, namely primarily the sale of goods, and which has, to that end, several workers, technical means and an organisational structure in that the store is an individual cost centre managed by a manager." [...] In Lyttle v Bluebird UK Bidco 2 Ltd, the Court of Justice held this meant that Woolworths shops in Northern Ireland, each with under 20 employees, could claim to be separate establishments. More doubtfully, it was held by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in E Green & Sons (Castings) Ltd v ASTMS that three companies, all operating from the same premises, were different establishments {{even though they were}} part of the same group. There is considerable disagreement over when an employing entity must begin consulting: the Directive says when decision-makers are [...] "contemplating", while the Regulations say [...] "proposes". In AEK ry v Fujitsu Siemens Computers Oy the Court of Justice held consulting must begin [...] "once a strategic or commercial decision compelling him to contemplate or to plan for <b>collective</b> <b>redundancies</b> has been taken." [...] In groups of companies, where a parent controls the subsidiary, the duty to perform the consulting process falls on the subsidiary, but the duty begins as soon as the parent has contemplated that a particular subsidiary [...] "has been identified" [...] for redundancies for consulting [...] "to have any meaning". Consultation should take place with the recognised trade union first, but if there is none, then elected employee representatives, if necessary giving enough time to organise an election. Section 188(7) says that an employer has a [...] "defence" [...] for not consulting if there are [...] "exceptional circumstances", but this [...] "exception" [...] is not in the Directive, and courts have avoided applying it. Dismissals cannot take effect until meaningful negotiation has taken place. If employers fail to negotiate, they must pay a [...] "protective award" [...] of up to 90 days' pay to each employee. Essentially similar rules apply for consultation with staff before any transfer of an undertaking.|$|E

The constitution also defined new power relationships between labor and management, with a strong bias in favor of labor.

40|$|Throughout the {{duration}} of the UK’s membership of the European Union (EU), non-implementation and incorrect transposition of Directives has been commonplace. Coupled with the Court of Justice of the European Union’s refusal to extend the direct effect of Directives to horizontal relationships, and historic difficulties in holding States liable in damages, it has often fallen to the national courts to give effect to EU laws through purposive statutory interpretation. Recent cases involving the <b>collective</b> <b>redundancy</b> of workers in the UK (currently awaiting a ruling from the Court of Justice through the preliminary reference procedure), and the High Court’s assessment of State Liability in the insurance sector, raise questions as to the efficacy of the current system of enforcement of EU law domestically. Despite the problems of access to EU rights experienced by workers in the UK, there appears to be hope that the judiciary is becoming more attuned to the relationship between EU and domestic laws, and are willing to take control of granting access to remedies without necessarily waiting for EU institutions to provide express permission or instruction. 2014 was a particularly important year in this regard. However, a systematic review of the UK’s transposition of EU law and the impact on individuals of the current suite of enforcement mechanisms is required if private enforcement of EU law is to provide the protection workers need and to which they are entitled...|$|R

50|$|The present 2009 Directive updated the Works Council Directive 94/45/EC, {{which in}} the same pattern as now, applied to every firm with over 1000 {{employees}}, and at least 150 employees in a different member state.

More positively, the Information and Consultation Directive 2002 requires that workplaces with over 20 or 50 staff have the right to set up elected work councils with a range of binding rights, the European Works Council Directive 2009 enables work councils transnationally, and the Employee Involvement Directive 2001 requires representation of workers on company boards in some European Companies.

5000|$|Third, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 section 188 {{requires}} employers, who are [...] "contemplating" [...] redundancies of 20 employees, in an [...] "establishment" [...] over 90 days, {{to consult}} for 30 {{days with the}} workforce. [...] "Redundancy" [...] is an economic dismissal [...] "not related to the individual concerned" [...] (e.g. for poor work or misconduct). In University of Stirling v UCU the Supreme Court held that expiry of fixed term contracts, for 140 University teaching staff, did not count as a reason [...] "related to the individual", and so staff should have been consulted. An [...] "establishment" [...] includes [...] "a distinct entity that is ordinarily permanent, entrusted with performing specified tasks, namely primarily the sale of goods, and which has, to that end, several workers, technical means and an organisational structure in that the store is an individual cost centre managed by a manager." [...] In Lyttle v Bluebird UK Bidco 2 Ltd, the Court of Justice held this meant that Woolworths shops in Northern Ireland, each with under 20 employees, could claim to be separate establishments. More doubtfully, it was held by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in E Green & Sons (Castings) Ltd v ASTMS that three companies, all operating from the same premises, were different establishments {{even though they were}} part of the same group. There is considerable disagreement over when an employing entity must begin consulting: the Directive says when decision-makers are [...] "contemplating", while the Regulations say [...] "proposes". In AEK ry v Fujitsu Siemens Computers Oy the Court of Justice held consulting must begin [...] "once a strategic or commercial decision compelling him to contemplate or to plan for <b>collective</b> <b>redundancies</b> has been taken." [...] In groups of companies, where a parent controls the subsidiary, the duty to perform the consulting process falls on the subsidiary, but the duty begins as soon as the parent has contemplated that a particular subsidiary [...] "has been identified" [...] for redundancies for consulting [...] "to have any meaning". Consultation should take place with the recognised trade union first, but if there is none, then elected employee representatives, if necessary giving enough time to organise an election. Section 188(7) says that an employer has a [...] "defence" [...] for not consulting if there are [...] "exceptional circumstances", but this [...] "exception" [...] is not in the Directive, and courts have avoided applying it. Dismissals cannot take effect until meaningful negotiation has taken place. If employers fail to negotiate, they must pay a [...] "protective award" [...] of up to 90 days' pay to each employee.

40|$|So far, the European Union {{adopted a}} Directive on firing any {{individual}} content to regulate only matters of <b>collective</b> <b>redundancies</b> {{due to the}} social implications that occur usually in case of collective dismissals and, simultaneously, their potential conflicts. Directive no. 98 / 95 /EC of 20 July 1998 on the approximation {{of the laws of}} Member States relating to <b>collective</b> <b>redundancies</b> was adopted by the Council of the European Union since it was necessary to grant greater protection to workers in the event of <b>collective</b> <b>redundancies.</b> The provisions of Directive no. 98 / 59 /EC of 20 July 1998 on the approximation of the laws of Member States relating to <b>collective</b> <b>redundancies</b> have been transposed into national law by the Romanian Government Emergency Ordinance no. 55 / 2006 amending and supplementing the Labour Code so that in this case no question of direct application of Community rules, but can not disregard its interpretation by the European Court of Justice...|$|E
40|$|In {{the case}} of <b>collective</b> <b>redundancies,</b> {{employers}} are forced to regard certain characteristics when deciding {{who is going to}} be dismissed. This paper develops a procedure to derive an empirical based weighting scheme between the characteristics relevant for this selection (age, disability, dependencies and tenure). First, panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the years 1991 - 2010 is used to estimate, conditional on the existence of dismissal protection, the relationships of the four characteristics with respect to reemployment probabilities and the quality of the new job (measured in terms of wage). Second, the individual valuation of the two outcomes is compared applying a life satisfaction analysis. Finally, based on the empirical results a weighting scheme for the characteristics is proposed, which serves as an evidence based guideline for employers, employees and unions in the process of <b>collective</b> <b>redundancies...</b>|$|E

40|$|In her PhD thesis, {{the author}} {{deals with the}} legal {{regulation}} of transfer of undertaking (and {{the passage of the}} employees' rights and obligations it involves) and the frequent collective redundancy related to such transfers. Both sets of provisions dealing with these topics are embodied in the Czech Labour Code and are harmonised with the EU directives pertaining to these fields, specifically Council Directive 2001 / 23 /EC of 12 March 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses (originally, Council Directive 77 / 187 /EEC of 14 February 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses) and Council Directive 98 / 59 /EC of 20 July 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to <b>collective</b> <b>redundancies.</b> The two directives mentioned above were already transposed to the Czech Labour Code in 2001 by means of an amendment adopted under No. 155 / 2001 Coll. As regards the rules governing <b>collective</b> <b>redundancies,</b> it can be stated, in substance, that the original regulation of 2001 remained unchanged and [...] ...|$|E
