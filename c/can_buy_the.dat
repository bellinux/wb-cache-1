He also revealed that he would participate in a Reddit [...] "Ask Me Anything" [...] session on the day of the album release. Yankovic explained that the pre-release campaign deliberately withheld song information, since he felt it has become more difficult to establish a unique take on a parody in the age of YouTube content creation. He later made an appearance on the Hulu sitcom The Hotwives of Orlando that coincided with the Mandatory Fun launch. After the album was released, he elaborated that putting out singles was technically unnecessary, since customers <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> songs individually from digital vendors.|$|E

He organises a Citizen of the Year event at the motel, but it is stolen by Lassiter's after Steph accidentally costs the motel their liquor licence. Paul asks Cecilia Saint (Candice Alley) to sabotage the event, but is horrified when the hotel boiler explodes, injuring Daniel and killing Josh and Doug. While supporting a grieving Terese, admitting {{to her that he}} loves her, Paul worries that Cecilia caused the explosion. Paul persuades Nene to lie to the police to support his false alibi. Paul is arrested after he is found to have deleted CCTV footage of him in the boiler room. Steph visits Paul in prison, where he maintains his innocence. They put up the motel for Paul's bail and he is released. Terese is angry when he comes to Josh's funeral and later says she hates him. Paul investigates alternative suspects, but Mark tells him to stop. After Julie Quill (Gail Easdale) accuses Paul of harassment, his bail conditions are reviewed and he is required to wear an ankle monitor. Aaron becomes Paul's PR adviser. Paul does an interview with Piper which is put online. Paul's position becomes worse when Cecilia tells the police that Paul confessed. Aaron then advises Paul {{to take part in a}} voluntary clean-up, which is criticised by Nate. Paul is hit by a car and taken to hospital. After being discharged, Paul decides to run away and he steals $3000 from the motel. Paul meets Jacka in the bush and seeks his help in getting a passport. He then calls Steph asking her to bring him money, but she refuses.|$|E

2500|$|A mortgage-backed {{security}} (MBS) {{is a type}} of asset-backed {{security that}} is secured by a mortgage or collection of mortgages. The mortgages are sold to a group of individuals (a government agency or investment bank) that securitizes, or packages, the loans together into a security that investors <b>can</b> <b>buy.</b> <b>The</b> mortgages of an MBS may be residential or commercial, depending on whether it is an Agency MBS or a Non-Agency MBS; in the United States they may be issued by structures set up by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or they can be [...] "private-label", issued by structures set up by investment banks. The structure of the MBS may be known as [...] "pass-through", where the interest and principal payments from the borrower or homebuyer pass through it to the MBS holder, or it may be more complex, made up of a pool of other MBSs. Other types of MBS include collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs, often structured as real estate mortgage investment conduits) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).|$|E

Relative Wave, the architects behind Björk's multimedia app for Biophilia (2011), took nearly a year to develop the Artpop app. Some dismissed the project as an elaborate ploy to inflate album sales, under the assumption Billboard would count a downloaded track as a complete unit. Editorial director Bill Werde later addressed these concerns on in July 2013, [...] "As we understand, Gaga fans will get [...] Artpop app for free and <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> album [...] app. Albums purchased this way would count on Billboard charts, however, ... concerns about self-reported data by Gaga's [...] seem unfounded– sales will be fulfilled and reported by existing digital retailers... for those who may ask: This is obviously different from Jay Z's Magna Carta Holy Grail / Samsung [...] which—via an app—gave [...] for free [...] had no option for fans to buy."

Timberlake said [...] "I had her poster on my wall so I'm psyched", later describing the experience as [...] "fulfilling." [...] Jackson performed with the group on several dates, including joining them for a live a cappella rendition of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Overjoyed." [...] A biography stated it was a [...] "highlight" [...] moment for Timberlake which [...] "gave Justin {{a chance to show}} his family and friends how far he had come." [...] The tour was the largest audience the group performed for at the time; JC Chasez commenting [...] "That was great because we got to see how a real professional tours. And not only that she is really sweet. We really enjoyed it." [...] Chris Kirkpatrick added, [...] "She is very good at entertaining. We learned a lot — that if people want to hear just the music, they <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> CD. But it's the whole live aspect of changing the songs every night or the whole theatrical performance that she puts on. She's definitely one of our mentors when it comes to touring and the stage show. Her show told a story, and that's what people like to see." [...] Timberlake was previously inspired to become a performer after attending Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour, saying [...] "She didn't just stand there and sing her song", fascinated by her [...] "energy and exuberance". A friend commented [...] "He was always into Janet." [...] Author Sean Smith stated, [...] "Much has been made of Michael Jackson's influence on Justin's music, but he is only {{one of a number of}} influential artists who have shaped the musical style of Mr. JT, and he is not even the most influential member of the Jackson clan. That accolade firmly belongs to Janet Jackson", who was [...] "one of the most successful artists of the last twenty years." [...] Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became [...] "good friends", ultimately leading to Timberlake performing alongside Jackson during a segment of Jackson's controversial Super Bowl Halftime Show performance. Usher described opening for Jackson as [...] "the biggest event" [...] of his career and an [...] "honor", saying [...] "She's a definite entertainer, works hard and sweats every night. I learned a lot about how to make an artist look like a star." [...] Nick Lachey and group 98 Degrees opened for several dates and experienced increased commercial success following the tour.
