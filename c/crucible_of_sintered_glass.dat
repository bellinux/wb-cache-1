The kinetics of continuous culture {{can also be}} adequately described by the model developed from the batch tests. Production of lactic using immobilized cells of Lactobacillus rhamnosus was studied in continuously recycled packed column reactors. Four inert inorganic supports were used to immobilize Lactobacillus rhamnosus cells; raschig-rings <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> <b>glass,</b> beads <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> <b>glass,</b> beads <b>of</b> porous glass, and irregular ceramic particles.

With this the conventional process step "pressing" should be replaced in terms of cost and time savings and as part of small series. The selected additive process was powder bed 3 D printing (3 DP). The 3 DP of glass powders in technical applications was a novelty, so that experiences in the field of ceramics allowed the introduction to the problem and their development for glass. The challenge was to maintain comparable properties of the blanks for <b>sintered</b> <b>glass</b> bodies despite {{the differences between the two}} shaping processes pressing and 3 DP. The shaping- pressure used in pressing is not available in 3 DP. Required density and porosity have to be achieved by a suitable particle size distribution of the starting materials. Development of a processing method for glass powder and a binder system of liquid and solid components were important contributions to that. Glasspowder with particle size distributions from < 165 µm with 20 % to 30 % fines (2 - 3 µm) made the best results. The shrinkage of the blanks <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> <b>glass</b> bodies during the binding and sintering process was 18 % to 20 %. It depends on geometry and allowed the accurate setting of the required CAD data (*. stl).

40|$|Wave and {{transport}} phenomena through porous media are {{of great importance}} in science and industrial applications, because they involve the interaction of various physical mechanisms and can provide useful informations {{of the structure of}} the porous medium. Despite the extensive application in modern industry and comprehensive research, transport and wave propagation through porous materials are not fully understood. This work focuses on the investigations of hydraulical and acoustical properties <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> <b>glass</b> bead systems, which serve as replacement for rock samples. In contrast to common rock samples the hydraulical and acoustical properties <b>of</b> the <b>sintered</b> <b>glass</b> bead samples can be selectively influenced by the selection of certain <b>glass</b> beads and <b>sintering</b> treatments. Moreover, their high gray-scale contrast to the pore space, in addition to the relatively simple pore structure favors their use in scientific research and image analysis. The research goal is to understand the essential physical phenomena and mechanisms, which determine the transport and wave behavior in fluid-saturated porous <b>sintered</b> <b>glass</b> bead systems. For this purpose, a multi-purpose measuring cell is developed, which enables, besides stationary and dynamic permeability measurements, also to perform ultrasound experiments, while the produced porous sintered samples can be saturated with different fluids. The steady-state and oscillatory flow processes through <b>sintered</b> <b>glass</b> bead packings, are investigated, in order to determine both, the stationary and frequency-dependent hydraulic properties. For the ultrasound experiments the porous sintered samples are either saturated with Newtonian fluids, like water or silicone oil, or with magnetorheological fluids (MRF), which is a suspension of micron-sized, magnetizable particles in a silicone-oil-based carrying fluid. The wave propagation in MRFsaturated porous sintered samples is studied at different magnetization strengths. The ultrasound experiments are performed according to the transmission method and analyzed using the spectral ratio technique. The ultrasound experiments reveal nicely the dispersive nature <b>of</b> the fluid-saturated <b>sintered</b> granular materials and show strong frequency filtering as the dispersion properties of the detected waves are highly influenced by the pore fluid. The experimental studies of transport and waves are complemented by extensive research on the morphology by using XRCT-based images of the produced samples. A special focus lies on the elaborate μXRCT data processing of the produced samples. The proposed frameworks for μXRCT analysis can be used for arbitrary porous media.

40|$|There has {{recently}} been considerable interest in the acoustics of fluid-saturated porous media. The most interesting peculiarity, the existence of two compressional waves, was first predicted by Biot [1] in 1956. It was not until 1980 that Plona [2] experimentally observed the additional slow compressional bulk wave in a water-saturated porous solid composed <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> <b>glass</b> spheres.

The expected modes are either below the fluid velocity, so that energy will not leak into the fluid at all, or just above it so that energy leaks at such a high angle, in which case simple phase-matching techniques are not applicable for excitation and detection. In a recent paper [4], the authors suggested the application of a slightly corrugated periodic surface, since, in this case every surface mode becomes somewhat “leaky” in certain directions at particular resonant frequencies.

40|$|We define an adimensional {{parameter}} that {{is capable}} of predicting if a given glass powder compact can be fully densified by viscous flow sintering or if concurrent surface crystallization will hinder densification. The proposed sinterability parameter is S(T) =g/[NS. r.

For high temperatures, T> 0. 8 Tm, where Tm is the melting point, another expression can be used: ShT(T) = 2 PI. g-R. Tm^ 2. Vm^ 3 / 2 /[NS. r. kB. DHm.

This expression avoids the (time consuming) measurement of U(T) and eta(T). Predictions can be made by S or ShT avoiding the need to perform any sintering experiment. For a given glass-forming composition the physical properties are fixed, but higher temperatures and smaller particle sizes increase S and privilege sintering over surface crystallization.

The focus is on the characterization of the drying kinetic and its dependence on the development of salt crystals at the porous media surface. Together with analysis of the drying curves in relation with direct visualizations of the sample surface, quantitative pieces of information on the efflorescence growth and structure are obtained from X-ray computed tomography imaging. The study shows that markedly different results are obtained depending on the mean pore size of pellet. This is explained by the completely different efflorescence structure resulting from the drying process. A very thin salt crust is obtained for sufficiently small pores whereas cauliflower like efflorescence structures are obtained for sufficiently large pores. The salt crust tends to severely reduce the evaporation rate whereas the cauliflower like efflorescence does not affect the evaporation rate compared to pure water drying as long as the efflorescence is wet. In the case of the cauliflower type, the X-ray computed tomography images indicate a greater efflorescence growth at the periphery of the porous medium surface.

However, the <b>sintering</b> <b>of</b> ZrO 2 ·MgO·CuO (Z·CuO) shows a viscous flow mechanism (n = 0), a similar phenomena to that <b>of</b> by <b>sintering</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass.</b> Transformations, such as: CuO to Cu 2 O at 1000 ◦C, ZrO 2 (m) to ZrO 2 (t) at 1100 ◦C and Cu 2 O (s) to Cu 2 O (l) at 1230 ◦C cause successive rearrangements of microstructure inside <b>of</b> region I (<b>sintering</b> process) {{and lead to}} interpretation errors when the Bannister equation is used. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S. r. l.

40|$|The {{representative}} {{volume element}} (RVE) {{is a basic}} concept in the continuum mechanics <b>of</b> <b>sintering</b> <b>of</b> random heterogeneous porous materials. A quantitative determination of its size was performed by using synchrotron X-ray microtomography data <b>of</b> constrained <b>sintering</b> <b>of</b> thin <b>glass</b> film on a rigid substrate. A RVE size {{is associated with a}} property of interest; we determined it for relative density, specific surface area, and hydrostatic component <b>of</b> <b>sintering</b> stress. The RVE size was estimated to be from 11 to 17 times larger than the average initial particle size. The RVE size was associated with a given precision of the property. It depended on the volume fraction of porous structure, or, relative density, so that it varied with microstructural evolution...|$|R

40|$|The {{crystallization}} kinetics of a {{glass with}} a molar composition 40 BaO- 20 ZnO- 30 B(2) O(3) - 10 SiO(2) was investigated. The kinetic parameters, activation energy for crystallization (E-c) and Avrami exponent (n), were evaluated under non-isothermal conditions using the results obtained by differential thermal analysis (DTA) performed at different heating rates. DTA curves exhibited two overlapping exothermic peaks associated with the crystallization of the glass. Barium borate (BaB 4 O 7) was the first crystalline phase to be formed and {{it was followed by}} the formation of barium zinc silicate (BaZnSiO 4), as identified by XRD. For the first exothermic peak, when the fraction of crystallization (v) increased from 0. 1 to 0. 9, the local activation energy (Ec(v)) decreased from 700 to 500 kJ/mol, while for the second exothermic peak, E-c(chi) slightly increased from 490 to 570 kJ/mol. For the range of 0. 1 < chi < 0. 9, the local Avrami exponent (n(chi)) increased from similar to 1 to 1. 4 for the first exothermic peak and it decreased from similar to 1. 7 to 1. 4 for the second exothermic peak. Observation by SEM of the microstructure <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> <b>glass</b> samples revealed that crystallization started at the surface of glass particles, with growth of lamellar crystallites, that together with some quasi-spherical nano-sized crystallites progressed towards the inside of the glass at the highest sintering temperatures. The change of the local activation energy with the fraction of crystallization suggested that a multi-step kinetic reaction took place during <b>sintering</b> and crystallization <b>of</b> the glass.
