5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} {{have been}} observed swallowing city pigeons in St. James's Park in London. Spokeswoman for the Royal Parks Louise Wood opined that feeding on other birds is more likely with captive pelicans that live in a semi-urban environment and are in constant close contact with humans. However, in southern Africa eggs and chicks of the Cape cormorant are an important food source for great white pelicans. Several other bird species have been recorded in the diet of this pelican in South Africa, including <b>Cape</b> <b>gannet</b> chicks on Malgas Island as well as crowned cormorants, kelp gulls, greater crested terns and African penguins on Dassen Island and elsewhere. The Australian pelican, which is particularly {{willing to take a}} wide range of prey items, has been recorded feeding on young Australian white ibis, and young and adult grey teals and silver gulls. Brown pelicans have been reported preying on young common murres in California as well as the eggs and nestlings of cattle egrets and nestling great egrets in Baja California, Mexico. Peruvian pelicans in Chile have been recorded feeding on nestlings of imperial shags, juvenile Peruvian diving petrels and grey gulls. Cannibalism of chicks of their own species is known from the Australian, brown and Peruvian pelicans.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOceanic {{structures}} such as mesoscale fronts {{may become}} hotspots of biological activity through concentration and enrichment processes. These fronts generally attract fish and may therefore be targeted by marine top-predators. In the southern Benguela upwelling system, such fronts might be used as environmental cues by foraging seabirds. In this study we analyzed high-frequency foraging tracks (GPS, 1 s sampling) of <b>Cape</b> <b>gannets</b> Morus capensis from two colonies located on the west and east coast of South Africa in relation to mesoscale fronts detected on daily high-resolution chlorophyll-a maps (MODIS, 1 km). We tested the association of (i) searching behavior and (ii) diving activity of foraging birds with mesoscale fronts. We found that <b>Cape</b> <b>gannets</b> shift from transiting to area-restricted search mode (ARS) {{at a distance from}} fronts ranging between 2 and 11 km (median is 6. 7 km). This suggests that <b>Cape</b> <b>gannets</b> may be able to sense fronts (smell or vision) or other predators, and that such detection triggers an intensified investigation of their surroundings (i. e. ARS). Also we found that diving probability increases near fronts in 11 out of 20 tracks investigated (55 %), suggesting that <b>Cape</b> <b>gannets</b> substantially use fronts for feeding; in the remaining cases (45 %), birds may have used other cues for feeding including fishing vessels, particularly for gannets breeding on the west coast. We demonstrated in this study that oceanographic {{structures such as}} mesoscale fronts are important environmental cues used by a foraging seabird within the rich waters of an upwelling system. There is now need for further investigations on how <b>Cape</b> <b>gannets</b> actually detect these fronts...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>gannet</b> is {{identified}} from the Australasian gannet by the all-black tail, a longer black stripe down the throat (from underneath the beak) and more extensive black on the face, {{but all of}} these features are difficult to identify unless at close proximity. The <b>Cape</b> <b>gannet</b> is also {{very similar to the}} northern gannet, but the latter differs from its entirely white tail and its wings, which are only black at the tip. It also is similar to the blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) and was formerly placed in the genus Sula.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>gannet</b> is the {{predator}} species most {{closely associated with}} sardine presence along the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal coastline and is the most useful indicator of sardine run activity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cape</b> <b>gannets</b> are {{powerful}} fliers, using mainly a flap-gliding technique, {{which is more}} energy consuming than the dynamic-soaring favoured by albatrosses. As all Sulids, they are fish-eating birds that plunge-dive from considerable height.|$|R
40|$|The {{breeding}} success, {{and consequently}} population size, of <b>Cape</b> <b>Gannets</b> has been hypothesised to be strongly {{dependent on the}} size of the sardine and anchovy resources in South Africa. The quantification of such relationships is a pre-requisite for attempts to tailor management approaches for these fish resources so as to take adequate account of the needs of predators for which these species provide forage. As a first step towards this end, this document presents the results from some analyses of the relationships between the contributions in percentage (by mass) of sardine and of anchovy in the diet of <b>Cape</b> <b>Gannets</b> to the abundances of these resources...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide {{fisheries}} generate {{large volumes}} of fishery waste and it is often assumed that this additional food is beneficial to populations of marine top-predators. We challenge this concept via a detailed study of foraging <b>Cape</b> <b>gannets</b> Morus capensis and of their feeding environment in the Benguela upwelling zone. The natural prey of <b>Cape</b> <b>gannets</b> (pelagic fishes) is depleted and birds now feed extensively on fishery wastes. These are beneficial to non-breeding birds, which show reduced feeding effort and high survival. By contrast, breeding gannets double their diving effort {{in an attempt to}} provision their chicks predominantly with high-quality, live pelagic fishes. Owing to a scarcity of this resource, they fail and most chicks die. Our study supports the junk-food hypothesis for <b>Cape</b> <b>gannets</b> since it shows that non-breeding birds can survive when complementing their diet with fishery wastes, but that they struggle to reproduce if live prey is scarce. This is due to the negative impact of low-quality fishery wastes on the growth patterns of gannet chicks. Marine management policies should not assume that fishery waste is generally beneficial to scavenging seabirds and that an abundance of this artificial resource will automatically inflate their populations...|$|R
50|$|Vagrancy to the {{northern}} Atlantic Ocean has been reported for the <b>Cape</b> <b>gannet</b> on several occasions, but is currently believed to be unproven. Crochet and Haas examined {{the status of the}} species in the western Palearctic region. They list a number of historical claims which had not been accepted by national bird records committees, and analyse the single record which had hitherto been widely accepted, a juvenile recovered offshore from Western Sahara in 1966. In relation to the latter bird, they conclude that a mistake had occurred; the original data placed the bird inland, in Chad, with the offshore Western Saharan location being the result of an attempt to correct this to a more plausible location. A (re)transposition of the original latitude and longitude gives a location off the Namibian coast, well within the regular wintering range of the species. As a result, they recommend that the <b>Cape</b> <b>gannet</b> be deleted from the Western Palearctic list.|$|E
50|$|Dolphins (estimated {{as being}} up to 18,000 in number, mostly the common dolphin (Delphinus capensis) are largely {{responsible}} for rounding up the sardines into bait balls. These bait balls can be 10-20 metres in diameter and extend {{to a depth of}} 10 metres. The bait balls are short lived and seldom last longer than 10 minutes. Once the sardines are rounded up, sharks (primarily the bronze whaler), and birds (like the <b>Cape</b> <b>gannet),</b> and Bryde's whales take advantage of the opportunity.|$|E
50|$|Bird Island {{is one of}} {{only six}} {{breeding}} sites in the world for the <b>Cape</b> <b>gannet</b> (Morus capensis). “Larus dominicanus (the Kelp Gull) and Haematopus moquini (the African Oystercatcher) are found throughout the Algoa Bay complex. The island group is also known to hold large numbers of Sterna vittata (Antarctic Tern), which in winter roost on the island in their thousands (regularly holding between 10% and 20% of the estimated total Afrotropical non-breeding population).” The island is also home to Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus).|$|E
40|$|A recent {{decline in}} {{population}} numbers of <b>Cape</b> <b>gannets</b> (Morus capensis) breeding off {{the west coast of}} South Africa coincided with decreased availability of lipid-rich fish prey: anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardinops sagax). Seabirds can use fishery discards as an alternative, but the quality of this food in the Benguela ecosystem is lower than that of their natural prey species. We consider whether chick growth and survival during chick rearing co-vary with the periods of high and low availability of their lipid-rich prey species and whether fishery discards would be an alternative. The proportion of anchovy and sardine in the diet was between 66 and 84 % in the years 1986 - 1988, but just 16 - 35 % from 2004 to 2006. Months with large proportions of anchovy and sardine in the diet were associated with faster chick growth. No association between the proportion of fishery discards in the diet and chick growth was found. The patterns are consistent with the notion that a distributional shift of anchovy and sardine decreased their contribution to the diet of <b>Cape</b> <b>gannets</b> and slowed chick growth along with lessening chick survival at the breeding colony. The reduced survival may partially explain the decline in numbers of <b>Cape</b> <b>gannets</b> breeding in the southern Benguela...|$|R

50|$|Great white {{pelicans}} are {{not restricted}} to fish, however, and are often opportunistic foragers. In some situations, they eat chicks of other birds, such as the well documented case off the southwest coast of South Africa. Here, breeding pelicans from the Dassen Island predate chicks weighing up to 2 kg from the <b>Cape</b> <b>gannet</b> colony on Malgas Island. Similarly, in Walvis Bay, Namibia the eggs and chicks of Cape cormorants are fed regularly to young pelicans. The local pelican population is so reliant on the cormorants, that when the cormorant species experienced a population decline, the numbers of pelicans appeared to decline as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} range of <b>Cape</b> <b>gannet</b> {{is restricted to}} southern Africa in three islands off Namibia and three islands off South Africa.

40|$|International audienceFisheries {{are often}} accused of {{starving}} vulnerableseabirds, yet {{evidence for this}} claim is scarce. Foragingenergetics may provide efficient, short-term indicatorsof the fitness status of seabirds competing with fisheries. We used this approach in <b>Cape</b> <b>gannets</b> (Morus capensis) from Malgas Island, South Africa, which feed primarilyon small pelagic fish in the southern Benguela upwellingregion, thereby competing with purse-seine fisheries. Duringtheir 2011 – 2014 breeding seasons, we determined bodycondition of breeding adult <b>Cape</b> <b>gannets</b> and measuredtheir chick growth rates. In addition to these conventionalfitness indices, we assessed the daily energy expenditure ofbreeding adults using a high-resolution time-energy budgetderived from GPS-tracking and accelerometry data. Forthese same individuals, we also determined prey intakerates using stomach temperature recordings. We found that adult body condition and chick growth rates declinedsignificantly during the study period. Crucially, mostbirds (73 %) studied with electronic recorders spent moreenergy than they gained through foraging, and 80 – 95 % oftheir feeding dives were unsuccessful. Our results thereforepoint to unprofitable foraging in <b>Cape</b> <b>gannets,</b> witha longer-term fitness cost in terms of adult body conditionand reproductive performance that corresponds to a localpopulation decline. Based on this evidence, we advocatea revision of regional fishing quotas for small pelagic fishand discuss {{the possibility of an}} experimental cessation ofpurse-seine fishing activities off the west coast of SouthAfrica. These measures are needed for the ecological andsocio-economical persistence of the broader southern Benguelaupwelling ecosystem...|$|R

50|$|There are twelve small islands on the Namibian coast between Walvis Bay and Orange River. Due to the Benguela Current, {{the seas}} {{on the west}} coast of {{southern}} Africa {{are some of the most}} productive in the world. The current flows north from the Southern Ocean and offshore winds drive the surface water away from the coast. Water rises from depths of hundreds of metres and at speeds of up to 12 m per minute bringing nutrients to the surface. A combination of sunlight and nutrients provide the conditions for phytoplankton which are the foundation for other life in the Benguela marine ecosystem. Feeding on the phytoplankton are Zooplankton, which attract an abundance of shoaling pelagic fish and is the reason why southern Africa is home to one of the richest seabird communities in the world. The islands off the west coast of southern Africa provide refuge from predators and <b>Cape</b> <b>gannet</b> (Morus capensis) and Cape cormorants (Phalacrocorax capensis) are the region's most abundant seabirds with tens of thousands on the islands during the nesting season.

40|$|Seabirds forage in {{a highly}} dynamic {{environment}} and prey on fish schools that are patchily distributed. Colonially breeding seabirds regularly commute {{back and forth from}} their colony to foraging areas and need to acquire information on the location of food before and/or during each foraging trip. The use of conspecifics as cues to locate prey has long been debated, and although the hypothesis was backed up by modeling studies, observations have been contradictory. We deployed GPS devices coupled with micro video cameras on <b>Cape</b> <b>Gannets</b> to observe the social context of foraging seabirds and the influence of conspecifics on the movement of individuals. The <b>Cape</b> <b>Gannets</b> reached their first patch using a succession of flights interrupted by stops on the water, during which the birds were mainly preening. During flight, the birds reacted to conspecifics by changing direction, either flying in the opposite direction of conspecifics that were flying toward the colony or following conspecifics outward. The time to reach the first patch was significantly reduced (by half) when the birds reacted to conspecifics in these different ways, compared with the birds that did not react. The use of conspecifics flying toward the colony to find food is consistent with the hypothesis that colonies can act as a focal place for information transfer, with foragers updating their flying direction when they detect conspecifics flying toward the colony. The fine-scale reaction of seabirds toward each other at sea, and the associated improved foraging efficiency, as well as the division of trips into a succession of flights, constitute elements that indicate the existence and the use of a structured network among foraging <b>Cape</b> <b>Gannets...</b>|$|R
