5|$|As the {{visibility}} of LGBT comic book creators and characters has increased, comic book fandom has taken notice. Panels discussing LGBT topics occur regularly at comic book and LGBT conventions such as Comicon and Gaylaxicon, and conventions also feature stands dedicated to LGBT comics. Ted Abenheim, event chair of Prism Comics said in 2008, “We’re in our sixth year of exhibiting at Comic-Con, presenting a larger booth and more panels and events than ever before.” A number of websites dedicated to LGBT comic book fandom and featuring <b>content</b> <b>from</b> staff writers exist, such as Prismcomics.org, Pinkkrytonite.com and Gayleague.com.|$|E
5|$|Deodato drew {{influence}} from {{the works of}} Paolo Cavara, Gualtiero Jacopetti, and Franco Prosperi, documentary filmmakers of whom Deodato was a fan. Prosperi and Jacopetti produced several Mondo films, which are documentaries {{similar to the one}} made in Cannibal Holocaust. These documentaries focused on sensationalistic and graphic <b>content</b> <b>from</b> around the world, including bizarre local customs, death, and general cruelty. Deodato followed suit in ways of similar content, such as graphic violence and animal slayings. Although fictional, Deodato created a similar exposé of worldly violence, such as Cavara's, Prosperi's and Jacopetti's Mondo Cane.|$|E
5|$|EarthBound Ness became {{widely known}} from his later {{appearance}} as an ensemble cast {{member in the}} Super Smash Bros. fighting game series, including the original Super Smash Bros. (1999) and its sequels: Melee (2001), Brawl (2008), and 3DS/Wii U (2014). Ness's inclusion in the original release was among its biggest surprises, and renewed Mother series fans' faith in new <b>content</b> <b>from</b> Nintendo. Ness {{was one of the}} game's most powerful characters, according to IGN, if players could perfect his odd controls and psychic powers. In Europe, which did not see an EarthBound release, Ness was better known {{for his role in the}} fighting game than for his original role in the role-playing game.|$|E

Some of the iHome software, which plays video <b>content</b> <b>from</b> a computer onto a television, was released in 2006 as a universal binary.|$|E
5|$|It was {{received}} positively by reviewers, with praise for its material for Dungeon Masters and its illustrations, but received criticism for its weak player-oriented content.

5|$|Lucasfilm Games re-submitted the edited {{version of}} Maniac Mansion to Nintendo, which then {{manufactured}} 250,000 cartridges. Each cartridge was {{fitted with a}} battery-powered back-up to save data. Nintendo announced the port through its official magazine in early 1990, and it provided further coverage later that year. The ability to microwave a hamster remained in the game, which Crockford cited {{as an example of}} the censors' contradictory criteria. However, Nintendo later noticed it, and after the first batch of cartridges was sold, Jaleco was forced to remove the <b>content</b> <b>from</b> future shipments.|$|E
