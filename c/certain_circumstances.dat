5|$|After the 2000 election, Fletcher {{crafted a}} {{compromise}} bill that allowed patients to sue their HMOs in federal court, capped {{pain and suffering}} awards at $500,000, and eliminated punitive damage awards. Despite an eventual compromise allowing patient lawsuits to go to state courts under <b>certain</b> <b>circumstances</b> and heavy lobbying in favor of Fletcher's bill by President George W.

5|$|DKA happens {{most often}} in those with type 1 {{diabetes}}, but can also occur in those {{with other types of}} diabetes under <b>certain</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Triggers may include infection, not taking insulin correctly, stroke, and certain medications such as steroids. DKA results from a shortage of insulin; in response the body switches to burning fatty acids which produces acidic ketone bodies. DKA is typically diagnosed when testing finds high blood sugar, low blood pH, and ketoacids in either the blood or urine.|$|E

Today Yucatecan, Tzotzil and Tojolab'al have a basic fixed VOS word order. Mamean, Q'anjob'al, Jakaltek and one dialect of Chuj have a fixed VSO one. Only Ch'orti' has a basic SVO word order. Other Mayan languages allow both VSO and VOS word orders.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{warships}} of Antiquity, Byzantine and Arab ships did not feature rams, and {{the primary}} means of ship-to-ship combat were boarding actions and missile fire, {{as well as the}} use of inflammable materials such as Greek fire.

5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} and dense clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk, proplyd, around the young star. This may give birth to planets in <b>certain</b> <b>circumstances,</b> which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next10–100 million years.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{bay bolete}} is {{predominantly}} a mycorrhizal species, {{it does have}} some saprophytic tendencies and {{may be able to}} use this lifestyle in <b>certain</b> <b>circumstances.</b> The ectomycorrhizae formed between I.badia and spruce (Picea abies) have active hyphal sheaths and a higher potential to store nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than other mycorrhizal types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic stands and its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of macronutrients. Mycorrhizae with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) have also been described.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind the forward funnel {{to allow the}} vertical leg {{to serve as a}} support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the foremast moved forward of the funnels to reduce the problem in the spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of the aft funnel to do that, which rendered the aft spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both funnels under <b>certain</b> <b>circumstances.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{aerodynamic}} aircraft which operate {{relative to}} the air, winds affect groundspeed, {{and in the case}} of lighter-than-air vehicles, wind may play a significant or solitary role in their movement and ground track. The velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor governing the direction of flight operations at an airport, and airfield runways are aligned to account for the common wind direction(s) of the local area. While taking off with a tailwind may be necessary under <b>certain</b> <b>circumstances,</b> a headwind is generally desirable. A tailwind increases takeoff distance required and decreases the climb gradient.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, a bill is {{presented}} for royal assent {{after it has}} passed all the required stages in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the House of Commons may, under <b>certain</b> <b>circumstances,</b> direct that a bill be presented for assent despite lack of passage by the House of Lords. Officially, assent is granted by the sovereign or by Lords Commissioners authorised to act by letters patent. It may be granted in parliament or outside parliament; in the latter case, each house must be separately notified before the bill takes effect.|$|E

5|$|The Court's {{right to}} give damages was reiterated in Phelps v Prothero in 1855, where the Court of Appeal in Chancery held {{that if a}} {{plaintiff}} starts an action {{in a court of}} equity for specific performance and damages are also appropriate, the court of equity may choose to award damages. This authorisation was limited to <b>certain</b> <b>circumstances,</b> and was again not regularly used. Eventually, the Chancery Amendment Act 1858 gave the Court full jurisdiction to award damages; the situation before that was so limited that lawyers at the time commented as if the Court had not previously been able to do so.|$|E
