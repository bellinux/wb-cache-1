40|$|Operations {{research}} is a commonly used method in many subjects nowadays. One applicable domain of operation {{research is}} the problem of facility layout and location. In this paper, a new mathematical programing model is developed for an optimal facility location and assignment. The model includes two objective functions. The first one minimizes the total material handling and fixed costs of facility location. Because of the importance of energy and the main role of fossil fuel in transportation, the second objective function, minimizes the total cost of fuel consumption. To consider the real condition in the proposed model, the cost of fuel, is considered to increase stepwise gradually. In the proposed model the coefficients of objective function are considered to be probabilistic and some of constraints to be fuzzy variables. Using a new approach, this model can be changed to a robust model. To prove the applicability of the model, it is examined for a real <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>facility</b> location...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{cities have}} {{different}} types of mixed-use complexes to increase urban density for preventing suburban sprawl. Intermediary space is a third space that connects a mixed-use complex and its surrounding area. This study examined the main functions of intermediary spaces and user satisfaction with the intermediary spaces’ amenities in three European mixed-use mega-complexes. It focused on various amenity elements in intermediary spaces, including daylight, noise, green space, <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>facility,</b> management, and accessibility. The data were collected through site visits and a questionnaire survey of space users in the three mixed-use complexes. Major findings identified the main purposes of visitation to intermediary spaces, the amenity elements affecting user satisfaction, {{and the relationship between}} users’ satisfaction with these spaces and their perceptions of the complexes. Results showed that intermediary spaces functioned in various ways and users’ satisfaction with these spaces related closely to their perceptions of complex buildings. Evidence from the research will provide important guidelines for improving environmental quality of intermediary spaces to make them more functional for space users. </p...|$|E
