40|$|Caustic soda is {{the most}} widely used {{chemical}} for cleaning sugar mill evaporators in Australia. It is partially effective in removing silica, silicates, proteins, polysaccharides and organic matter, but is ineffective when the major components of scale consist of calcium phosphate, calcium oxalate, calcium magnesium aconitate, <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> and potassium <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate.</b> In such situations, sulphamic acid is typically used. Some mills have found these normal procedures unsatisfactory and have used alternative but expensive cleaning methods, which have proved effective. However, these mills still use caustic soda and sulphamic acid in combination with the alternative methods to clean evaporators resulting in a time consuming and laborious process. This paper describes the effect of caustic soda solution in the presence of additives to solubilise different scale types. The paper also describes attempts to identify foam components in scale and provides results on the efficacy of defoamers...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{investigation}} was to study the mechanisms of mixed salt crystallisation fouling on heat transfer surfaces during convective heat transfer and sub-cooled flow boiling conditions. To-date no investigations on the effects of operating parameters on the deposition of mixtures of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate,</b> which are the most common constituents of scales formed on heat transfer surfaces, have been reported. As part of this research project, a substantial number of experiments were performed to determine the mechanisms controlling deposition. Fluid velocity, heat flux, surface and bulk temperatures, concentration of the solution, ionic strength, pressure and heat transfer surface material were varied systematically. After clarification of the effect of these parameters on the deposition process, the results of these experiments were used to develop a mechanistic model for prediction of fouling resistances, caused by crystallisation of mixed salts, under convective heat transfer and subcooled flow boiling conditions. It was assumed that the deposition process of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> takes place in two successive events. These events are the combined effects related to transport phenomena and chemical kinetics. The effect of the extra deposition created on the heat transfer surface due to sub-cooled flow boiling was considered by inclusion of an enhancement factor. The newly developed model takes into account the effects of all important parameters on scaling phenomena and also considers the simultaneous precipitation and competition of various minerals in the scale formation process. Model predictions were compared with the measured experimental data when <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> form and deposit on the heat transfer surface simultaneously. While deviations ranging from 6 % to 25 % between model predictions and measured experimental data can be considered good in the context of such a complex process, fouling morphology is clearly a factor to be considered in more detail. This is particularly problematic in the context of more complex fouling solutions encountered in industry. Furthermore, the crystalline samples were analysed using Scanning Electron Microscopy, X- Ray Diffraction and Ion Chromatography techniques. Fractal analysis performed on Scanning Electron Microscopy photographs of the deposits was used to quantify deposit characteristics by introducing a new quantity called the fractal dimension...|$|R

In most of samples, the content of animal glue was not confirmed because the amide I and II bands are masked by the broad bands of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> oxalate and <b>carbonate.</b> Further analysis using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) will be useful to identify the proteins in the sample.

40|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> and <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> scales {{can lead}} to an {{increase}} in running costs, can decline or stop the flow of fluids, and can cause early equipment fouling and failure in several industrial sectors, such as oil industries and desalted water production plants. A way to delay or hinder the formation of these salts is to use a proper additive, able to modify the nucleation kinetic increasing the induction times for salt nucleation. However, in order to properly understand the overall phenomenon it is worth defining the scenario of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and <b>carbonate</b> salts nucleation kinetics {{in the absence of any}} additive.

40|$|A {{fluid bed}} dryer with inert {{particles}} represents a very attractive alternative to other drying technologies according to the main efficiency criteria, i. e. specific water evaporation rate, specific heat consumption and speci­fic air consumption. A high drying efficiency results from the large con­tact area and from the large temperature difference between the inlet and outlet air. A rapid mixing of the particles leads to nearly isothermal conditions throughout the bed. A {{fluid bed dryer}} with inert particles was used for drying of slurries. Experiments were performed in a cylindrical column 215 mm in diameter with glass spheres as inert particles. In this paper, results of drying experi­ments with slurries of Zineb fungicide, copper hydroxide, calcium carbo­nate and pure water used as the feed material are presented. In our fluidized bed we successfully dried {{a number of other}} materials such as: fungicides and pesticides (Ziram, Propineb, Mangozeb, copper oxy-chloride, copper oxy-sulphate, Bordeaux mixture), other inorganic compounds (<b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> cobalt <b>carbonate,</b> electrolytic copper, sodium chloride), and a complex compound (organo-bentonite). The effects of operating conditions on dryer throughput and product quality were investigated. Main performance criteria, i. e. specific water evaporation rate, specific heat consumption and specific air consumption, were quantified. Temperature profile along the bed was mapped, and nearly isothermal conditions were found due to thorough mixing of the particles. Analysis of drying and energy efficiencies as a function of inlet and outlet air temperature difference was performed for deeper insight in dryer behavior and for optimizing dryer design and operation from an energy point of view. A simple mathematical model based on an overall heat balance predicts the dryer performance quite well. The industrial prototype with fluid bed of 0. 8 m in diameter and capacity 650 kg of evaporated moisture per hour was realized on the basis of presented investigations on pilot unit.
