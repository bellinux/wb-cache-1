In this model, price-cost margins in a <b>global</b> <b>loan</b> market are endogenous and countercyclical. As a result, a positive TFP shock in one country spills over to another through {{a reduction in the}} global cost of both credit and externally financed investment. The quantitative analysis shows that countercyclical margins on loans {{play a key role in}} bringing the predictions of the theory closer to the observed cross-country cyclical co-movements of consumption, employment, investment and output.

30|$|The author used an {{innovative}} methodology {{to generate the}} 3 D subsurface fracture map of the studied reservoir by integrating field data, such as wellbore images and conventional well logs. In this approach, an object-based <b>conditional</b> <b>global</b> optimization technique is used to generate the subsurface fracture map of the reservoir which combines the following: (1) statistical analysis of different sources of data (as mentioned above); (2) finite element-based modelling of tectonic history of the reservoir structure to generate probabilistic fracture attributes; (3) development of complex relationship between different sources of data (data sources mentioned in (1) and the data generated in (2)) using back propagation neural network; (4) sequential Gaussian stochastic simulation to generate object-based 3 D subsurface fracture map and (5) simulated annealing optimization technique to generate an optimum subsurface fracture map. In object-based model, each single fracture is treated as a single object with its specific properties such as location (centre point), dip, azimuth and size (radius). Each object possesses a variety of rules for behaviour in space such as shift, rotate, grow, shrink, multiply or disappear. The optimization process involves a series of trial and errors utilizing the nominated rules to minimize the objective function which {{is the difference between}} each fracture system realization and the target.

40|$|Naturally {{fractured}} reservoirs {{are generally}} extremely complex. The aim of characterisation and modelling of such reservoirs is to construct numerical models {{of rock and}} fractures, preparing input data for reliable stimulation and fluid flow simulation analyses. This requires the knowledge of different fracture heterogeneities and their correlations at well locations and inter-well regions. This study addresses the issues of how to integrate different information from various field data sources and construct comprehensive discrete fracture networks for naturally fractured reservoir. The methodology combines several mathematical and artificial intelligent techniques, which include statistics, geostatistics, fuzzy neural network, stochastic simulation and simulated annealing global optimisation. The study has contributed to knowledge in characterisation and modelling of naturally fractured reservoirs in several ways. It has developed:. An effective and data-dependant fracture characterisation procedure. It examines all the conventional reservoir data sources and their roles towards characterisation of different fracture properties. The procedure {{has the advantage of}} being both comprehensive and flexible. It is able to integrate all multi-scaled and diverse fracture information from the different data sources.. An improved hybrid stochastic generation algorithm for modelling discrete fracture networks. The stochastic simulation is able to utilise both discrete and continuum fracture information. It could simulate not only complicated distributions for fracture properties (e. g. multimodal circular statistics and non-parametric distributions) but also their correlations. In addition, with the incorporation of artificial fuzzy neural simulation, discrete multifractal geometry of fracture size and fracture density distribution map could be evaluated and modelled. Compared to most of the previous fracture modelling approach, this model is more flexible and comprehensive.. An improved <b>conditional</b> <b>global</b> optimisation model for modelling discrete fracture networks. The hybrid model takes full advantages of the advanced fracture characterisation using geostatistical and fuzzy neural analyses.
