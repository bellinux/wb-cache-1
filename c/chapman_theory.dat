The transmitted chirp signals pass through the ionosphere, resulting delayed, attenuated, and, in the phase, distorted. MARSIS signals are routinely phase corrected during ground processing by adopting a predefined model based on the <b>Chapman</b> <b>theory.</b> In this letter, phase distortions are compensated by using a phasegradient- autofocus algorithm, which is capable of correcting distortions of different nature by exploiting their redundancy along the orbit. For the first time, images presenting saturated regions have been recovered...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of ozone}} in the {{atmosphere}} is reviewed with emphasis on the behavior in the stretosphere. The methods for measuring total amount and the vertical distribution of ozone are described. Ozone measurements from the ground, a satellite and an ozonesonde are summarized. The photochemistry in the pure oxygen atmosphere (<b>Chapman</b> <b>theory)</b> is described and the crucial role of minor constituents such as Nox, Hox and ClOx is stressed. The distribution and the seasonal variation of total ozone are closely related with the planetary waves. The difference {{in the distribution of}} total ozone between the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres is due to the difference in the wave activities. The transport of ozone in the stratosphere and the intrusion processes from the stratosphere to the troposphere are shown. The estimation of ozone transport associated with tropopause folding events over Eastern Asia is given. The effect of CFCs on the stratospheric ozone is described. The ozone decrease in the Antarctic region in spring (ozone-hole) is stated briefly. Finally, the importance of radiative role of stratospheric and tropospheric ozone is shown...|$|E
40|$|Several {{models of}} the martian {{ionosphere}} have been developed in the last years. In this paper, a new empirical model for the dayside electron density of the martian ionosphere (primary and secondary layer), called NeMars, is described. The model is mainly based on MARSIS AIS data (Active Ionospheric Sounding from the Mars Advanced Radar and Ionospheric Sounding experiment aboard Mars Express mission) {{and to a lesser}} extent on radio occultation data from the Mars Global Surveyor mission. The model is able to reproduce to a reasonable degree the main characteristics of the electron density profiles obtained with the two techniques by considering solar zenith angle, solar flux F- 10. 7 as a proxy of the solar activity, and heliocentric distance. The model partially assumes the <b>Chapman</b> <b>theory,</b> the scale height for the main layer of the model varies with the solar zenith angle and the altitude, and the Chapman-like photochemical processes dominate diffusion up to about 200 km altitude. In addition, we assess the level of importance that parameters like heliocentric distance, solar longitude, solar activity or solar zenith angle have on the formation of the ionosphere. Eventually, we compare the Total Electron Content (TEC) derived from NeMars model with the values obtained from the MARSIS radar operating in subsurface mode...|$|E

Among its characteristics, {{it is the most}} variable, anomalous, and difficult region to predict. Major deviations from <b>Chapman</b> <b>theory</b> (Chapman 1931), which is based on the regular variability of the electron concentrations with solar zenith angles, are named “anomalies.” Many ionospheric researchers (Bellchambers and Piggott 1958; Penndorf 1965; Dudeney and Piggott 1978) studied the F 2 layer over Antarctica using ground-based ionosondes. They found a region near the Antarctic Peninsula including the Weddell Sea area with an anomalous behavior in f 0 F 2. This phenomenon was called the Weddell Sea Anomaly (WSA). The WSA is characterized by higher electron densities during the night than during the day, where the authors considered night the time interval between 10  p.m. to 4 : 00  a.m. local time (LT) and day the interval of 10 : 00  a.m. to 6 : 00  p.m. LT (Lin et al. 2009).

40|$|Interaction between anions {{and soil}} colloids was governed by 2 {{antagonistic}} processes, anion exclusion and positive anion adsorption. The predominantly negative charge on the colloids caused anion repulsion; positively charged sites and chemisorption resulted in positive adsorption. Experimentally determined adsorption was the resultant of the 2 processes and yielded true net adsorption by correction for continuous anion exclusion. Assuming the Gouy <b>Chapman</b> <b>theory</b> {{of the electric}} double layer, de Haan calculated exclusion as the apparent distance from the colloid surface free from anions of different valency. The method was valid for systems containing monovalent and divalent cations and anions with an approximation for trivalent anions, and was extended to interacting double layers. The product of apparent distance of exclusion and of the colloid's specific surface was the volume of exclusion (V ex), {{the same as the}} experimental adsorption value. Thus anion exclusion measurements yielded values for the colloid's specific surface. V ex was determined by a tracer method for Cl -, S 0 4 2 -, and P 0 4 3 -, and by potentiometric titration for Cl -. Adsorption of different anions could be determined simultaneously. Theoretical derivations were confirmed in experiments with fairly pure clays and in 12 Dutch soils, with special attention to phosphate adsorption. The correction for anion exclusion allowed refined measurements of anion adsorption and explained the bonding mechanisms between anions and soil colloids...|$|E
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} most of {{the electron}} density profiles returned from the Mars Global Surveyor Radio Science Experiment, with a view toward investigating {{the shapes of the}} profiles and the altitudes of the upper (F 1) and lower (E) peaks as a function of solar zenith angle and solar activity. We first categorize the shapes of the profiles according to the morphology of the F 1 and E peaks, and find that there is an expected variation with solar activity of the two major types of shapes, those in which the E-peak appears as a shoulder on the bottomside of the F 1 peak, and those in which the E peak is separated by a small minimum from the F 1 peak. Since the peak altitudes have been shown to vary with planetocentric longitude, we divide the data into 36 10 °E. longitude bins. We have plotted the peak altitudes of both the upper and lower peaks as a function of ln(effective secant χ), where χ is the solar zenith angle. The “effective secant” is derived by integrating the densities along the line of sight to the Sun and dividing the result by the vertically integrated densities. We then fit the peak altitudes in each longitude bin with linear least squared regressions, and report the slopes and intercepts of the lines, which, in <b>Chapman</b> <b>theory,</b> correspond to the scale heights and the subsolar peak altitudes, respectively. We find that both parameters are highly variable, and the median slopes for the F 1 and E peaks are about 7 and 4 km, respectively. If interpreted as a scale height, the latter value implies a temperature in the unrealistic range of 70 – 75 K. In <b>Chapman</b> <b>theory,</b> there is no solar activity variation of the peak heights. When we plot the peak altitudes versus F 10. 7 for each longitude bin, however, and fit them to a trendline, we find that the mean slopes are negative for both the F 1 and E peaks, although the slopes are in general smaller for the F 1 peaks. We conclude that the E peak heights are inversely correlated with solar activity, but the evidence is not as strong for the F 1 peaks. We compare electron density profiles from a numerical model to Chapman profiles, and show that the fit is poor for one Chapman profile, but is improved with a superposition of two Chapman profiles, although there are still large deviations, especially on the topside. Finally, we plot the peaks of the near-terminator numerical models for low and high solar activities as a function of ln(effective secant χ), and find that the linear fits appear to be good, but the slopes are not indicative of the scale heights in our models, nor are the intercepts the same as the peak heights of our 0 ° models. We conclude from these various studies that there is considerable evidence for non-Chapman behavior in the ionosphere of Mars...|$|E

After analyzing the data, the writer found out that Metaphor, Simile, Metonymy, and Repetition, including Anaphora, Epistrophe, Symploce, Anadiplosis, and Epizeuzis, are the types of the figurative expressions occurring in the speech. The speaker uses those types of figurative expressions to be functioning in some ways. There are two groups of functions in the speech: Directives, which contains some types of performative function - suggest and command, and Representatives/ Assertives including predict, assert, describe state and report. Some types of figurative expressions perform one or two functions or even almost all of the functions in certain stages. The findings on the speaker meaning of figurative expressions reveal that the speaker described about the bad condition of the Negro?s life that had suffered from racial discrimination and segregation for many years and predicted what would happen if the racial discrimination and segregation were unsolved.

40|$|We analyze {{here the}} {{behavior}} of the magnitudes of the F 1 and E peaks of the electron density profiles measured by the Radio Science Subsystem of the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, as a function of solar zenith angle χ and solar flux. For each of the 658 days of data in the six occultation seasons in the northern hemisphere, we choose one profile to analyze, which is that for which the F 1 peak is the median value. We assume that the variations of the measured peak densities can be represented as Aa(cosχ) and as Bb(F 10. 7), where F 10. 7 is the usual solar flux proxy, appropriately shifted to the orbital position of Mars. To minimize the effect of solar activity, we divide the data into 6 F 10. 7 bins, fit the data in each bin, and derive the values of the exponent a and the coefficient AF 10. 7 for each bin. The median values that we derive for the exponent a is 0. 46 for the F 1 peak, and 0. 395 for the E peak. To minimize the effect of SZA, we divide the data into eight SZA bins, and derive the exponent b and the coefficient Bχ for each SZA bin. We argue that the last three SZA bins should be excluded because the fits were poor, due partly to the small number of data points in each of these bins. If we do so, the median values of b that we derive are 0. 27 and 0. 40 for the F 1 and E peaks, respectively. Finally we derive a 3 -parameter fit to all the data, which expresses the variability of the peak densities as a function of a′(cosχ) and b′(F 10. 7) simultaneously. The fitted values of the exponents a′ and b′ for the F 1 peak are 0. 45 and 0. 26, respectively; for the E peak, the values are 0. 39 and 0. 46, respectively.

30|$|At mid-latitude, the {{electron}} {{content in the}} ionosphere is primarily caused by solar irradiance. This effect varies on different timescales, but {{the rate of change}} of electron density also depends on loss processes, by recombination, and by electron movement (in terms of mean drift velocity), all of which are related by the continuity equation. According to the <b>Chapman</b> photochemical <b>theory</b> (Rishbeth and Garriot 1969), ionospheric electron content should have a diurnal variation with maximum values at noontime, when the solar zenith angle is lowest. Ionospheric electron density at any time and location depends on many factors: the composition of the neutral atmosphere and its physical conditions, such as density and temperature, the solar spectrum and any energetic particle fluxes able to ionize the atmospheric plasma, and finally the loss processes, both chemical and by transport. The production mechanism and the recombination process mainly depend on the concentrations of atomic oxygen and molecular nitrogen, respectively.|$|R

Because of multi-body correlations predicting {{the structure and}} thermodynamics of such systems remains a challenge. Earlier Marshall and <b>Chapman</b> developed a <b>theory</b> wherein association effects due to interactions multiply the partition function for clustering of particles in a reference hard-sphere system. The multi-body effects are incorporated in the clustering process, which in their work was obtained {{in the absence of}} the bulk medium. The bulk solvent effects were then modeled approximately within a second order perturbation approach. However, their approach is inadequate at high densities and for large association strengths. Based on the idea that the clustering of solvent in a defined coordination volume around the solute is related to occupancy statistics in that defined coordination volume, we develop an approach to incorporate the complete information about hard-sphere clustering in a bulk solvent at the density of interest. The occupancy probabilities are obtained from enhanced sampling simulations but we also develop a concise parametric form to model these probabilities using the quasichemical theory of solutions. We show that incorporating the complete reference information results in an approach that can predict the bonding state and thermodynamics of the colloidal solute for a wide range of system conditions.

Photographic records of good definition were taken at regular intervals {{over a period of}} four months during the summer of 1945 - 6. These were fully sealed for critical frequencies, true heights and thicknesses of all the layers present, and mean monthly values of these quantities for each hour are tabulated. An extensive correlation with magnetic data from Hermanus indicated good correlation between magnetic activity and disturbed ionospheric conditions. On these grounds some disturbed days were rejected, and others were eliminated on ionospheric grounds. Smoothed mean values are tabulated and graphs drawn. These are presented in concise form on "electron density maps", which are graphs showing lines of constant electron density plotted as functions of time and height. In part 1 (b), a new theory of layer-formation is developed, in which the temperature is assumed to vary linearly with height. The equations are compared at each step with those obtained by <b>Chapman</b> in his <b>theory</b> of layer-formation in an isothermal atmosphere. The equations for the maximum of electron density and its height are also given. The effect of the parameters on the shape of the layer is shown in graphical form. The equations are somewhat complex in form, but an ingenious graphical method has been devised suitable for the application of the theory to results given in the form of those in section 1 (a). From this application values are obtained for the temperature gradient, the temperature at 200 km. and its variation over the middle part of the day.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityIn this {{research}} {{the rates of}} evaporation of small drops of diamyl sebacate were determined {{in the range of}} radii of 0. 5 - 2. 0 microns and for a range of pressures of 0. 5 - 10 cm Hg. An expression is derived for the rate of evaporation and is compared with the rates determined experimentally. From the method of approach, the degree of approximation of earlier treatments may be estimated. In the process of evaporation from a liquid surface, the determining factor is the rate of diffusion of vapor away from the surface of a spherical drop of radius H is proportional to the gradient of the concentration, n 1. To determine the rate of evaporation, the gradient at the surface must be calculated from the solution to Fick's law of diffusion and the appropriate set of boundary conditions. This was first done in an approximate manner by Langmuir, and later with more accuracy by Bradley, Evans, and Whytlaw-Gray and by Frisch and Collins. In {{this research}}, the appropriate boundary condition at the surface was determined by equating the flux given by Fick's law to the flux calculated using the kinetic theory of gases. From the kinetic theory of gases, the flux of molecules condensing on a spherical surface per unit time from the gas phase is given by an integral involving the product of the velocity distribution (the density of molecules in velocity space) and the condensation coefficient; the probability or a molecule condensing on impact with the surface. In the presence of a concentration gradient, according to <b>Chapman</b> and Enskog's <b>theory</b> of non-uniform gases, the velocity distribution function will differ from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the distribution which is valid under equilibrium conditions, by a term proportional to the concentration gradient. The contribution of this term to the total flux was found to be appreciable. In general, the condensation coefficient may be considered to be a function of both the magnitude and the direction of the molecular velocity. However, very {{little is known about the}} functional dependence. Lennard-Jones and Devonshire have shown by calculation that for the case of hydrogen and deuterium adsorbing on a crystalline copper surface, the condensation coefficient has a long flat maximum. It may be assumed, therefore, that it is only a slowly varying function or the non-uniformity of the gas. In the subsequent development, the condensation coefficient was replaced by its average value, α, a constant which can be determined by experiment. If the number of molecules evaporating from the surface is assumed to be independent of the number arriving, the flux of evaporating molecules is easily evaluated by setting it equal to the flux of molecules that would be condensing from the gas phase if the system were at equilibrium. Equating the difference of the two fluxes to the total flux given by Fick's law, the boundary condition at the surface is shown to be of the form (∂n/∂r) s = h (n-(n(eq)) where h is a function of α, the temperature and the pressure. Using the stochastic formulation or Frisch and Collins, this boundary condition was rederived in an independent manner using as specialized conditions that the stochastic transition probability is isotropic, that the concentration is the steady-state concentration, and that the mean stochastic jump length is equal in magnitude to the mean free path. Using certain results of Frisch and Collins. an approximate solution to the differential equation expressing Fick's law and the appropriate boundary conditions may be obtained. To a high degree of accuracy, the rate of evaporation may then be shown to be given by the expression (dR/dt) - (hDn(eq)) /(1 +hR) The rates of evaporation of small diamyl sebacate droplets were determined in a Millikan oil drop chamber, which was thermostated by a built-on water bath. To measure the radii the law relating the radius to the velocity of free fall v, must be known. This was determined in the following manner. The law of fall was assumed to obey the Stokes-Cunningham formula relating the radius to the velocity, the viscosity and the pressure. A drop of dicapryl sebacate, whose rate of evaporation was measurably small was suspended between the plates by a voltage, V, and the velocities of free fall determined at a series of pressures. By a suitable extrapolation procedure, a rough value of R was determined. The charge was then calculated, corrected to the nearest integer, and R recalculated. b, the Cunningham coefficient, was now calculated, and for a series of drops, was found to obey the relation b = 7. 2 x 10 ^- 4 x (0. 864 + 0. 28 exp(-. 18 Rp) cm-cm Hg. This agrees to within 1 % of the form given by Millikan for clock oil and air. Due to the similarity in nature of diamyl sebacate and dicapryl sebacate, the same b was assumed to hold. The rate or evaporation was determined by measuring the voltage, V, just required to suspend the drop as a function of time. At any particular value of V, a measurement of the velocity of fall and thus of R, yielded a rough value of the charge. When this was corrected to the nearest integer, the radius was known as a function of time. When 1 /(dR/dt), corrected for the effect of radius on vapor pressure, was plotted versus Rp, since the diffusion coefficient varies inversely as the pressure, a straight line was obtained as predicted by equation (4). Using the experimental vapor pressures as determined by Perry and Weber, values of the condensation coefficient, and D, the diffusion coefficient were calculated from the intercept and slope. Using a hard sphere model, the radius calculated from the diffUsion coefficient corresponded to the state where the organic molecule was coiled up tightly. The condensation coefficient at the temperatures 25. 16 °C and 34. 94 °C was found to be 0. 50 and temperature independent. Probably, higher degrees of accuracy could be obtained from a law derived using higher order terms in the velocity distribution function or taking into account the perturbation of the surface on f. However, it is shown that for the larger part of experimental conditions, these effects are small. The values of obtained by the application of equation (4) compare very well with those obtained by independent means. Condensation coefficients obtained from the application of a formula developed by Bradley, Evans, and Whytlaw-Gray do not agree as well. There seems to be negligible difference in the values of the diffusion coefficient deduced by the two methods. It may be concluded that this method constitutes a fairly accurate method of determining α and D. The equations developed hold strictly only for the case of non-polar substances. In the case of polar liquids, where a deep transition zone due to long range forces may exist, the model proposed may break down quite seriously. This may account for such effects as very low condensation coefficient and large thermal accommodation coefficient (1. 0), as has been found experimentally for water...|$|R
40|$| of {{compacted}} expansive clays {{exposed to}} salinization path. The chapter also examines {{the influence of}} direction of salt diffusion durin dissipation of osmotic suction gradients on the swell behaviour of compacted expansive clays. Black cotton soil from Karnataka State {{was used as the}} expansive clay specimen to examine these objectives. Inundating compacted expansive clay specimens with (0. 1 M to 4 M) sodium chloride solutions at a total vertical pressure of 6. 25 kPa in oedometer cells exposed the clay specimens to salinization paths. Measurements of changes in swelling strains, matric suction (measured by filter paper method) and pore water chemistry with time provided insight into the relative influence of matric suction and salt diffusion on the kinetics of swell. Examining the time-axial deformation behaviour of compacted specimens exposed to salinization paths in the post-primary swell region delineated the influence of osmotic suction dissipation on the volume change behaviour of compacted expansive clays. The influence of direction of salt diffusion in response to osmotic suction gradients on the swelling behaviour of compacted expansive clay was examined in the following manner. Salt diffusion from external reservoir to soil water (salinization path) was accomplished by inundating compacted clay specimens with 0. 4 M and 4 M sodium chloride solutions in oedometer cells at 6. 25 kPa. Salt diffusion from soil water to external reservoir (desalinization path) was accomplished by inundating salt-amended specimens with distilled water in oedometer cells at 6. 25 kPa. Salt-amended specimens refer to expansive clay specimens remolded with 0. 4 M/ 4 M sodium chloride solution at desired moisture content and compacted to the design density. Experimental results illustrated that compacted specimens dissipated matric suction by absorption of distilled water and sodium chloride solutions. The initial osmotic suction difference was dissipated by inward diffusion of salts; salt solutions absorbed to dissipate matric suction also contributed to dissipation of osmotic suction difference. The compacted clay specimens swelled on inundation with sodium chloride solutions as dissipation of matric suction and the attendant growth of diffuse ion layer repulsion dominated compacted clay behaviour exposed to salinization paths. However exposure to salinization path reduced swell magnitudes of compacted clay specimens from reductions in diffuse ion layer thickness. The time-swell plots of the compacted clay specimens exposed to salinization path categorized into initial, primary and secondary swell regions. Rates of primary swell were 5 to 21 times larger than rates of secondary swell. Experimental data suggested that primary swell develops relatively rapidly as it is linked to rate of matric suction dissipation. Secondary swell developed more slowly as it is controlled by diffusion of salts and adsorption-desorption reactions. Increase in dissolved salts concentration in soil water during primary swell occurs from salt solution absorbed in response to matric suction and salt diffused in response to osmotic suction difference. Comparatively, increase in dissolved salts concentration in soil water during secondary swell occurs from diffusion of salts in response to osmotic suction gradients. Exposure of salt-amended clays to desalinization path caused outward diffusion of salts to dissipate osmotic suction difference and absorption of distilled water to quench the matric suction of the salt-amended specimens. The salt-amended specimens developed greater swell potentials than compacted specimens inundated with distilled water owing to reduction in dissolved salt concentration of soil water and replacement of native exchangeable calcium and magnesium ions by sodium ions. The time-swell behaviour of salt-amended specimens exposed to desalinization path categorize into four regions: small initial swell region followed by large primary swell and small secondary swell regions and lastly a large tertiary swell region. Complete dissipation of matric suction coincides with end of primary swell and both processes terminate in 120 - 240 minutes after inundation for salt-amended specimens exposed to desalinization paths. Further, only small fraction (16 to 18 %) of possible salt extrusion occurs at the end of primary swell and bulk of salt extrusion occurs during secondary and tertiary swell. Secondary swell developed at a slower rate than primary swell, as the rate of osmotic suction dissipation during secondary swell was smaller than rate of matric suction dissipation during primary swell. Likewise, tertiary swell developed at similar or faster rate than primary swell, as rate of osmotic suction dissipation during tertiary swell is similar or quicker than rate of matric suction dissipation during primary swell for the salt-amended clays. Analysis of the laboratory results showed that greater magnitude of outward salt diffusion mobilizes larger magnitudes of secondary + tertiary swell in response to dissipation of osmotic suction difference in case of the salt-amended clay specimens. Comparison of swelling behaviour of specimens exposed to salinization and desalinization paths revealed that the direction of salt diffusion impacts their swelling behaviour. Inward salt diffusion during salinization path reduces the swell magnitude of the compacted specimens. Bulk of the swell occurs during primary swell. Outward salt diffusion during desalinization path imparts a larger swell magnitude to the salt-amended specimens in comparison to the compacted specimen inundated with distilled water. Bulk of the swell occurs during secondary + tertiary swell. Dissipation of matric suction was rapid and coincided with the end of primary swell during salinization and desalinization paths. Bulk diffusion of salts during secondary and tertiary swell was a relatively slow process. Chapter 5 examines alterations in the wetting induced volumetric response of compacted clays from modifications in swell pressure upon exposure to salt solutions at range of total vertical pressures (6. 25 kPa to 200 kPa). The chapter delineates the manner in which dissipation of matric suction (arising due to unsaturated status of compacted clay) and osmotic suction difference (arising due to chemical concentration gradients between soil water and chemical reservoir) impacts the DDL repulsion pressure/swell pressure and wetting-induced volume change behaviour of compacted expansive clays as a function of total vertical pressures (6. 25 kPa to 200 kPa). Alterations in the diffuse double layer repulsion pressure of compacted clays from salt diffusion are calculated based on Gouy- <b>Chapman</b> diffuse double <b>theory.</b> The diffuse double layer repulsion pressures of compacted clays exposed to salinization paths are compared with the oedometer swell pressures. The impact of modifications in swell pressure from salt diffusion on the nature of wetting-induced volumetric strains (swell/compression) experienced by the compacted expansive clay specimens exposed to salinization paths is also examined. The nature of wetting-induced volume change behaviour is analyzed in context of the total vertical pressure to swell pressure ratio of specimens exposed to salinization paths. Salinization experiments are performed in conventional oedometers with the chemical boundary conditions imposed in an “open air” fashion. In the salinization experiments, salt solutions in the oedometer reservoir were in contact with the soil water through wet porous stones. Experimental results revealed that dissipation of initial osmotic suction difference between soil water and oedometer reservoir via salt migration impacted the diffuse double layer repulsion pressure and the wetting-induced volume change behaviour of compacted clays. Osmotic suction varies directly; while, the diffuse double layer thickness inversely varies with dissolved salt concentration of soil water. Consequently, inundation with sodium chloride solutions increase the initial osmotic suction difference {{at the expense of the}} diffuse double layer repulsion pressures developed by the compacted clay specimens. Salt diffusion in response to dissipation of osmotic suction difference reduced the theoretical (DDL repulsion pressure) and experimental swell pressures of compacted clays inundated with sodium chloride solutions. The theoretical swell pressures however greatly differed from the experimental swell pressures. The total vertical pressure to modified experimental swell pressure ratio determined the nature of axial strains (swell or compression) experienced by compacted clays on exposure to osmotic suction gradients. When the total vertical pressure to modified swell pressure ratio less than unity, the compacted clay specimens experienced net swelling on inundation with sodium chloride solutions. Conversely, when the total vertical pressure to modified swell pressure ratio exceeded unity, the compacted clay experienced net compression on inundation with sodium chloride solutions. When the total vertical pressure to modified swell pressure ratio was unity, the compacted clay did experience any net axial strains on inundating with sodium chloride solution. The ingress of sodium chloride solutions in response to matric suction saturated the void spaces of the compacted specimens prior to commencement of compression. As a result, compression strains experienced by the compacted specimens on exposure to salt solutions were mainly contributed by osmotic consolidation strains. The amount of salt diffused into soil water had direct bearing on the magnitude of osmotic consolidation strains experienced by the compacted specimens at given total vertical pressure value. The time-rates of primary consolidation are approximately 20 to 100 times quicker than rates of osmotic consolidation. The much slower rates of osmotic consolidation arise, as this process is mainly diffusion controlled in comparison to primary consolidation that is mainly dependent on the soil’s permeability to water flow under load-imposed hydraulic gradients. Primary consolidation strains exceed the osmotic consolidation strains at total vertical pressures of 100 kPa and 200 kPa on exposing the compacted specimen to 1 M sodium chloride solution. The osmotic consolidation strain exceeds the primary consolidation strain on exposing the compacted specimen to 4 M sodium chloride solution at total vertical pressure of 200 kPa. Chapter 6 develops a method to predict the osmotic consolidation strains of saturated clay specimens upon exposure to salinization paths at constant effective stress, examines the influence of cation exchange reactions on the osmotic swelling strains developed by saturated saline clay specimens upon exposure to desalinization path and osmotic consolidation strains developed by saturated desalinated clay specimens upon exposure to salinization path and effect of variation in compaction dry density and water content on the osmotic swell behaviour of saturated saline specimen exposed to desalinization path and osmotic consolidation behaviour of saturated desalinated specimen exposed to salinization path Experimental results illustrated that for a given osmotic suction difference (∆π), larger osmotic consolidation strains are predicted at the lower range of consolidation pressures (25 - 100 kPa), than at the higher range of consolidation pressures (200 - 400 kPa) as physico-chemical effects dominated the deformation behaviour at the lower stresses, while; mechanical effects (frictional effects, particle interference) became important at higher range of stresses due to proximity of particles and pa...|$|R
