5|$|In 1983's Never Say Never Again, Edward Fox played M as a bureaucrat, <b>contemptuous</b> <b>of</b> Bond—far {{removed from}} the {{relationship}} shared between Bernard Lee's M and Sean Connery's Bond; the academic Jeremy Black notes that the contempt felt for the 00 section by Fox's M was reciprocated by Connery's Bond. Fox's M is also younger {{than any of the}} previous incarnations. The media historian James Chapman notes that whilst M considers Bond to be an out-dated relic, the Foreign Secretary orders the 00 section to be re-activated.|$|E
5|$|Myrrha {{appears in}} the Divine Comedy poem Inferno by Dante Alighieri, where Dante sees her soul being punished in the eighth circle of Hell, in the tenth bolgia (ditch). Here she and other falsifiers such as the alchemists and the counterfeiters suffer dreadful diseases, Myrrha's being madness. Myrrha's {{suffering}} in the tenth bolgia indicates her most serious sin was not incest but deceit. Diana Glenn interprets the symbolism in Myrrha's contrapasso as being that her sin is so unnatural and unlawful that she is forced to abandon human society and simultaneously she loses her identity. Her madness in Hell prevents even basic communication which attests to her being <b>contemptuous</b> <b>of</b> the social order in life.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1954, General Nguyễn Văn Hinh, {{the head}} of the State of Vietnam's VNA, {{announced}} that he did not respect the leadership of Prime Minister Diệm, and vowed to overthrow him. The coup never materialised and Hinh was forced into exile, but not before appointing Ba Cụt to the rank of colonel in the VNA in an attempt to undermine Diệm, as the Hòa Hảo warlord was openly <b>contemptuous</b> <b>of</b> the prime minister. In August, Ba Cụt and his 3,000 men broke from the VNA and left their Thốt Nốt base for the jungle, and fought against those who had briefly been their comrades; this put him at odds with most Hòa Hảo leaders, who accepted government payments to integrate their forces into the VNA. Operation Ecaille, the initial military offensive by the VNA against Ba Cụt was a failure, possibly because the details of the planned attack on his forces were leaked to him by Soái, a Hòa Hảo member of the National Defence Committee.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, {{expressions}} of opinion {{made in a}} purely private conversation should not ordinarily be charged. Giving broad circulation to a written publication containing <b>contemptuous</b> words <b>of</b> the kind made punishable by this article, or the utterance <b>of</b> <b>contemptuous</b> words <b>of</b> this kind {{in the presence of}} military subordinates, aggravates the offense. Unlike civilian legislation covering defamation, the truth or falsity of the statements is immaterial.|$|R

5|$|The {{capabilities}} and reactionary {{nature of the}} judges have been criticized. The main complaint reportedly made by Saudis privately is that judges, who have wide discretion in interpreting the Sharia, have no knowledge, and are often <b>contemptuous,</b> <b>of</b> the modern world. Reported examples of judges' attitudes include rulings banning {{such things as the}} children’s game Pokémon, telephones that play recorded music, and sending flowers to hospital patients. Saudi judges come from a narrow recruitment pool. By one estimate, 80% of the 600+ Saudi judges and almost all senior judges come from Qasim, a province {{in the center of the}} country with less than 5% of Saudi's population, but known as the strict religious Wahhabi heartland of Saudi Arabia. Senior judges will only allow like-minded graduates of select religious institutes to join the judiciary and will remove judges that stray away from rigidly conservative judgments.|$|E
5|$|Ubico {{had made}} {{statements}} supporting {{the labor movement}} when campaigning for the presidency, but after his election his policy quickly became authoritarian. He abolished the system of debt peonage, {{and replaced it with}} a vagrancy law, which required all men of working age who did not own land to perform a minimum of 100 days of hard labor. In addition, the state made use of unpaid Indian labor to work on public infrastructure like roads and railroads. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property, an action described by historians as legalizing murder. He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it {{into one of the most}} efficient and ruthless in Latin America. The police were given greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. The result of these laws was to create tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers. Ubico was highly <b>contemptuous</b> <b>of</b> the country's indigenous people, once stating that they resembled donkeys.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} Latin tribes were <b>contemptuous</b> <b>of</b> the Romans {{after their}} latest expedition. Several of the Volsci cities had united, including Antium, Praeneste, and Velitrae. They liberated Satricum, slaying all the Roman inhabitants. Given this crisis, Camillus was appointed consular tribune {{for the sixth}} time.|$|E
25|$|Hopkins wrote also on {{the motion}} of glaciers and the {{transport}} of glacial erratics but trespassed on the sensitivities of J. D. Forbes who saw the subject as his personal fiefdom and was <b>contemptuous</b> <b>of</b> Hopkins's lack of observational experience in the subject.|$|E

25|$|The Court of Appeal {{found that}} the two {{remaining}} statements were not <b>contemptuous</b> <b>of</b> the courts. One of the statements {{could be construed as}} claiming that the Government, acting through the Prosecution, had chosen to bring reduced charges against a German national for fear of economic reprisals by the German government. The other statement was possibly directed at the People's Action Party, the ruling party of Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Pali {{sources say}} that beings in Maitreya's time will be much bigger than {{during the time of}} Sakyamuni.

But their father leaves them {{for long periods of}} time, because he must live in two worlds. One with his Indian bride, and the other with Lise in St. Louis. McKeag hates the situation, but bears with it and cares for the boys like an uncle. But Jacques grows <b>contemptuous</b> <b>of</b> McKeag's presence, sensing {{something}} between McKeag and his mother.|$|E
25|$|In 991 the Vikings sacked Ipswich, {{and their}} fleet made {{landfall}} near Maldon in Essex. The Danes {{demanded that the}} English pay a ransom, but the English commander Byrhtnoth refused; {{he was killed in}} the ensuing Battle of Maldon, and the English were easily defeated. From then on the Vikings seem to have raided anywhere at will; they were <b>contemptuous</b> <b>of</b> the lack of resistance from the English. Even the Alfredian systems of burhs failed. Æthelred seems to have just hidden, out of range of the raiders.|$|E
25|$|Robertson was <b>contemptuous</b> <b>of</b> the House Grey Memorandum (early 1916) and of President Woodrow Wilson’s {{offer to}} mediate in May 1916. Robertson and Hankey were sent {{from the room}} on 24 May 1916 so the {{politicians}} could discuss the offer, and McKenna (Exchequer) later told Hankey that he, Asquith, Grey and Balfour, but not Bonar Law or Lloyd George, had been in favour of accepting because of “the black financial outlook”. The plan was stopped when the entire Army Council, including Kitchener and Robertson, threatened to resign.|$|E

25|$|Minh {{went into}} exile in Bangkok, where he {{occupied}} himself with hobbies such as gardening and playing tennis. He still had many American friends, {{especially among the}} CIA, who gave him support during this period and paid for his dental bills. The U.S. ambassador, Ellsworth Bunker, was openly <b>contemptuous</b> <b>of</b> him and referred to him in public with obscenities. In return, he wrote a pro-war article for the respected Foreign Affairs quarterly in 1968, condemning the communists and rejecting a power-sharing agreement. This helped to end his exile, {{with the support of}} the United States.|$|E
25|$|Other {{indication}} of his passionate nature concerns an affair he {{is believed to}} have had with the English socialite Lady Ottoline Morrell, beginning when they first met in July or August 1898. Ottoline was then an unmarried 25-year-old member of the privileged London social scene, while being at the same time slightly <b>contemptuous</b> <b>of</b> it. Her intellectual and spiritual interests drew her to more mature men, such as Herbert Asquith, particularly if they had a reputation for iconoclasm. She and Axel Munthe were drawn to each other, and managed to spend significant private time together on Capri.|$|E
25|$|As a young adult, Tarzan meets a young American woman, Jane Porter. She, her father, {{and others}} of their party are marooned on exactly the same coastal jungle area where Tarzan's {{biological}} parents were twenty years earlier. When Jane returns to the United States, Tarzan leaves the jungle in search of her, his one true love. In The Return of Tarzan, Tarzan and Jane marry. In later books he lives with her {{for a time in}} England. They have one son, Jack, who takes the ape name Korak ("the Killer"). Tarzan is <b>contemptuous</b> <b>of</b> what he sees as the hypocrisy of civilization, and he and Jane return to Africa, making their home on an extensive estate that becomes a base for Tarzan's later adventures.|$|E
