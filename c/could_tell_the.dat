The American scholar of Indonesian literature Harry Aveling writes that Yah's employment as a prostitute was likely a capitulation by Pane to cultural constraints; Indonesian readers at the time would not have accepted Tono having an affair with someone of the same socio-economic status. Mohamad describes her as being fatalistic and notes that she downplays her past by saying that any of a thousand girls in Tanjung Priok <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> same story; he found her touching without being melodramatic, and notes that Yah was the first prostitute featured portrayed sympathetically in an Indonesian work.|$|E
25|$|During the 1830s, Sunderland {{became the}} most {{important}} shipbuilding centre in the country, and by 1840 there were 65 shipyards on the river. It was at this time, that Pile walked {{the banks of the}} River Wear, visiting the shipyards and never growing tired of seeing ships in the various stages of construction. As he grew older he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> name of every ship belonging to Sunderland, and who built them. It was said of him after his death, that being born in a shipyard he was hardly ever out of one.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, McDonald's lost a {{legal battle}} at the Danish Supreme Court to force Allan Pedersen, a hotdog vendor, to drop his shop name McAllan. Pedersen had {{previously}} visited Scotland on whisky tasting tours. He named his business after his favorite brand of whisky, MacAllan's, after contacting the distillery {{to see if they}} would object. They did not, but McDonald's did. However, the court ruled customers <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> difference between a one-man vendor and a multi-national chain and ordered McDonald's to pay 40,000 kroner ($6,900) in court costs. The verdict cannot be appealed.|$|E

25|$|Several Australian composers {{have written}} sacred music to {{celebrate}} Mary MacKillop. In 2009 Nicholas Buc {{was commissioned by}} the Shire of Glenelg to write an hour-long cantata mass for the centenary {{of the death of}} Mary MacKillop. It was premiered by the Royal Melbourne Philharmonic in Portland, Victoria. The Mass of Mary McKillop is a setting for congregational singing, composed by Joshua Cowie. Hymns specifically used in St Mary of the Cross celebrations including A Saint for Today and Mary MacKillop, Woman of Australia by Josephite Sister Margaret Cusack, and If I <b>Could</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>The</b> Love of God, In Love God Leads Us and Psalm 103 by Jesuit Priest Christopher Willcock.|$|E
25|$|Britain's Great Western Railway {{introduced}} the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system in 1906. This {{system is the}} forerunner of today's Automatic Warning System (AWS) and consists of an electrical system that sounded a bell in the cab as the train approached a signal at clear. Power was fed through a metal ramp to a pickup {{on the underside of}} the locomotive to power the bell. An absence of the electrical voltage on the ramp caused a warning horn to sound in the locomotive's cab. The driver then had a set time to acknowledge the warning and start braking his train accordingly. If the driver did not acknowledge the warning, the brakes would be applied automatically. Where this was implemented, it did away with the need for fog signalling, since the driver <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> state of the distant signal regardless of his ability to see it.|$|E
25|$|On 27 May, {{a report}} {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of}} the kite balloon with aircraft found that balloon observation was better for reports of the situation in general, including that of artillery-fire. During the days and nights, the balloon observer <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> British artillery group commander where German guns were firing, the areas worst bombarded, the areas of greatest activity, whether gas had been released and the direction it moved. Aircraft were considered better for artillery ranging, managing to operate in conditions which were impossible for the balloon. During the day, air observers saw far more gun flashes than the observation balloon crews but none after dark. A balloon observer could spot flashes at night and sometimes name the battery, given the observer's knowledge of the area. The advantage of telephone communication with the balloon observer over Morse wireless from aeroplanes was judged considerable.|$|E

500|$|William Godwin's {{theories}} of biographical writing significantly influenced Shelley's style. Her father believed that biography <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> {{history of a}} culture as well as serve a pedagogical function. Shelley felt that her nonfiction works were better than her fiction, writing in 1843 to publisher Edward Moxon: [...] "I should prefer quieter work, to be gathered from other works—such as my lives for the Cyclopedia—& which I think I do much better than romancing." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the Irish {{policy on}} rates at the time, {{the house was}} unroofed in 1946 and this hastened its demise. Pope Hennessy {{described}} Cuba Court in 1971: [...] "Like so many of Ireland's great houses, Cuba Court is now being slowly but deliberately demolished. The lime trees have long since been hacked down." [...] In spite of this, it was described as [...] "a superb ruin that <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> history of Ascendancy Ireland", as late as 1979. It was eventually acquired by a local businessman and demolished in the 1980s. Craig describes the loss of Cuba Court as [...] "particularly to be lamented". A development of four houses {{was built on the}} site at Cuba Avenue in 2003. An archaeological survey revealed nothing of significance.|$|E
500|$|The first printed {{version of}} Amy Robsart's murder {{appeared}} in the satirical libel Leicester's Commonwealth, a notorious propaganda work against the Earl of Leicester written by Catholic exiles in 1584. Here Sir Richard Verney goes directly to Cumnor Place, forces the servants {{to go to the}} market, and breaks Lady Amy's neck before placing her {{at the foot of the}} stairs; the jury's verdict is murder, and she is buried first secretly at the Cunmor parish church before being dug up and reburied at Oxford. Verney dies, communicating [...] "that all the devils in hell" [...] tore him in pieces; his servant (who was with him at the murder) having been killed in prison by Dudley's means before he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> story.|$|E

500|$|... "Patriot Games" [...] was {{watched by}} 8.45 million viewers, {{making it the}} 55th most-watched program of the week. According to MacFarlane, the episode {{polarized}} viewers, who either [...] "hated or loved the violence". Ryan J. Budke from AOL's TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, specifically praising the scene in which Stewie beats up Brian. Budke also {{said that it was}} [...] "fun" [...] and that you <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> crew had a good time making it. Overall, he considered it [...] "not a bad episode. The scene eventually {{became one of the most}} popular videos on YouTube." [...] The episode ranked number 1 in IGN's Top 10 Musical Moments in the show, for [...] "Shipoopi," [...] and Brian and Stewie's fight in the bathroom was named the 5th greatest fight scene in the show on another list.|$|E
500|$|During {{the filming}} of Last Summer, a seagull was killed. [...] "In one scene," [...] Hershey explained, [...] "I had to throw the bird {{in the air to}} make her fly. We had to reshoot the scene over and over again. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> bird was tired. Finally, when the scene was finished, the director, Frank Perry, told me the bird had broken her neck on the last throw." [...] Hershey felt {{responsible}} for the bird's death and changed her stage name to [...] "Seagull" [...] as a tribute to the creature. [...] "I felt her spirit enter me," [...] she later explained. [...] "It was the only moral thing to do." [...] The name change was not positively received. When she was offered a part opposite Timothy Bottoms in The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder (1974) (or Vrooder's Hooch), Hershey had to forfeit half her salary, $25,000, to be billed under the name [...] "Seagull" [...] because the producers were not in favor of the billing.|$|E
500|$|Mega-City One and {{its high}} rise towers {{were created in}} Cape Town Film Studios. Finding a {{suitable}} set for the expansive Peach Trees atrium proved difficult, and the producers {{did not want to}} build an expensive set. While observing scouting photos of Cape Town, the filmmakers noticed a large three-walled external space that looked like an interior when filmed at night. A key sequence involving Ma-Ma and her gang firing rotary cannons across the atrium in their attempt to kill Judge Dredd required ten days of filming and eight different sets inside and outside the studio which were blended together with visual effects. Visual effects supervisor Jon Thum was unable to accompany a helicopter flight to obtain planned aerial shots of Johannesburg due to last-minute flight permissions; the resulting shots were non-specific and Thum had to pick out ones that <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> story. Mantle had to develop new rigs to obtain close-up shots. Describing the aesthetic he aimed to achieve, he said: [...] "I hope it will be more painterly. If we get it right, it will be a cross between Blade Runner and Clockwork Orange." [...] Garland was a constant presence on the shoot; Urban turned to Garland for direction instead of Travis.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively by reviewers {{of the trade}} publications. A very positive review by Walton of The Moving Picture News states, [...] " [...] tale of deep, sterling, human interest. The whole plot is so simple, so refreshingly lucid and pure. We cannot criticize this film {{any more than a}} man could analyze mother love. There is a tenderness - and pathos - that is as a nimbus to the whole. The acting of the blind girl, natural, and exquisite, and of her little sister is sweetly innocent. We saw this film twice, on the day of release, in different theatres, and in each case large audiences were touched - and also highly amused by the little girl in the carriage. A sweeter, purer, human-interest tale has not been put on the curtain. The prayer scene deserves to be limned by a master hands that lesson to our children's children. Had we space we <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> comments of men and women on this production. One thing may be said and that is, all saw and realized the pathos, the beauty and the triumph of the work. Had the film been acted in a theatre we feel certain the audience, with ourselves, with one acclaim would have declared these two orphan girls as manifestations, in the hour of need, of the highest and best emotions of the race!" [...] The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer was also positive and concluded that, [...] "Such films are helpful because they make nearly despairing men sometimes hopeful, and as long as hope lasts there is opportunity for achievement." [...] Even the reviewer of The New York Dramatic Mirror offered praise for Marie Eline's acting ability in particular, but found no fault with the production itself. Bowers notes that the Mirror was not without its detractors and was accused of being a tool of the Edison Trust companies, but reviews for Thanhouser films were amongst the most perceptive.|$|E
500|$|The {{survivors}} {{split up}} {{into two groups}} {{to head to the}} Others' camp. Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway), and Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) walk on land to the camp, bringing guns and ammunition with them. Meanwhile, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) plan to use Desmond's sailboat to go by sea. Sayid plans to use black smoke as a signal, saying that [...] "this time, they will know that we are coming", a reference to the attacks in the first-season finale. When the boat reaches the Others' camp, Sayid finds it to be deserted. Meanwhile, Michael, Jack, Sawyer, Hurley and Kate engage in a gun battle with some Others that were following them, and Sawyer kills one. Jack confronts Michael about leading the group into a trap, and Michael confesses to the murders of Ana Lucia and Libby. They realize that Michael has led them to a location other than the beach, ruining their former plan to meet up with Sayid. There, they see a large pile of pneumatic tubes, suggesting that the reports sent out from the [...] discovered in the episode [...] "?" [...] had never been read. Shortly after the discovery of the tube pile, they hear whispers, and suddenly Sawyer, Kate, and Jack are incapacitated by electric darts. The hostages, bound and gagged, are brought to a dock, where it appears that the Others are led by Henry Gale (Michael Emerson). Gale keeps his bargain with Michael, returning his son, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), to him and giving them an old fishing boat with instructions to sail on a heading of 325 degrees until they are rescued. Michael threatens Henry that he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> outside world of the island's location. Henry responds by telling him that it wouldn't matter as they {{would not be able to}} find the island, should they return. He also gives Michael a counter-threat: if he did tell people of the island's location, people would know what he did to get his son back. Michael reluctantly accepts but asks who Henry and his people are, to which Henry responds [...] "We're the good guys, Michael". Michael uses the boat to get him and Walt off the island. Hurley is then released and sent back to the other survivors with a message that they are to stay away from the Others' part of the island. As Hurley is let go, the other three captives are taken away.|$|E
