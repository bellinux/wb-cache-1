Like this, it has been using agro-industrial wastes or by-products as nutrient sources in culture medium, having been used, in this study, the manipueira, a by-product of the processing of the cassava flour.

They appraised the following parameters: cellular growth, the production of spores, the reduction of organic matter (COD analysis) and the variation of reduction sugar.

Published data suggest that the composition of embryo <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> may influence the phenotype of the offspring. A review of the literature was carried out. Data concerning the potential effects on embryo development of <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> were assessed and recommendations for users made. The safety of ART procedures, especially with respect {{to the health of the}} offspring, is of major importance. There are reports from the literature indicating a possible effect of culture conditions, including <b>culture</b> <b>media,</b> on embryo and fetal development. Since the introduction of commercially available <b>culture</b> <b>media,</b> there has been a rapid development of different formulations, often not fully documented, disclosed or justified. There is now evidence that the environment the early embryo is exposed to can cause reprogramming of embryonic growth leading to alterations in fetal growth trajectory, birthweight, childhood growth and long-term disease including Type II diabetes and cardiovascular problems. The mechanism for this is likely to be epigenetic changes during the preimplantation period of development. In the present paper the ESHRE working group on <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> summarizes the present knowledge of potential effects on embryo development related to <b>culture</b> <b>media,</b> and makes recommendations. There is still a need for large prospective randomized trials to further elucidate the link between the composition of embryo <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> used and the phenotype of the offspring.

40|$|AbstractOur {{previous}} {{publications and}} the data presented here provide evidences {{on the ability of}} plant-based <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> to optimize the cultivability of rhizobacteria and to support their recovery from plant-soil environments. Compared to the tested chemically-synthetic <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> (e. g. nutrient agar and N-deficient combined-carbon sources media), slurry homogenates, crude saps, juices and powders of cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) and succulent plants (Aloe vera and Aloe arborescens) were rich enough to support growth of rhizobacteria. Representative isolates of Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Bacillus spp. and Azospirillum spp. exhibited good growth on agar plates of such plant-based <b>culture</b> <b>media.</b> Cell growth and biomass production in liquid batch cultures were comparable to those reported with the synthetic <b>culture</b> <b>media.</b> In addition, the tested plant-based <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> efficiently recovered populations of rhizobacteria associated to plant roots. Culturable populations of > 106 – 108 cfug− 1 were recovered from the ecto- and endo-rhizospheres of tested host plants.

40|$|Introduction:Lysine is an {{essential}} amino acid and has importance in food and pharmaceutical industry. Nowadays, there are different methods such as genetic and growth media optimization to enhance the lysine production. One of the useful methods in optimization of growth media is the response surface methodology. Materials and methods: In this study, lysine was produced by wild type of Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 15032 and the production increased by response surface methodology. After selection of M 9 <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> as a basic <b>culture</b> <b>media,</b> the effect of different factors such as carbon (glucose), nitrogen (ammonium sulphate) sources and methionine, as an additive, were studied on the lysine production. Then, the <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> {{and the time of}} incubation were optimized by response surface methodologyforlysine production. Results: The results showed that in M 9 <b>culture</b> <b>media,</b> the amount of the produced lysine was 0. 7 milligram per liter. In the optimized <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> (by response surface methodology) which has 14 % glucose, 5 % ammonium sulphate and 5 mM methionine, lysine was produced up to 0. 98 gram per liter after 2. 5 days incubation. Pareto analysis indicated that methionine is the most effective factor in the lysine production. Finally, the results of granulation showed that the optimum condition for granulation of <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> (containing lysine) was achieved by adding starch, ammonium sulphate and sodium chloride in low pH and 100 °C. Discussion and conclusion: According to the results, the proposed <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> by response surface methodology causes 1400 times increase in the lysine production compared with M 9 <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> and methionine had {{an important role in the}} production of lysine, probably by inhibiting the other metabolic pathway which has common metabolic precursor with lysine production metabolic pathway...|$|R

A quantitative research methodology has been used where an Internet based questionnaire sent out to gain insight into how popular <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> is used in religious education. The specific popular <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> that is {{examined in this study}} is music, documentary, film, TV-series, cartoons and games. The theoretical basis for this study is theories on religion and popular culture, Hjarvard’s theory on mediatization of religion, Gilhus’ spatial model of religion, and theoretical concepts from the didactics of religion. The sample for this project is 23 teachers from secondary schools in Hordaland and Rogaland. The respondents were asked what popular <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> they used, and for what purpose it was used, in religious education. The data material shows a wide variety of popular <b>culture</b> <b>media</b> being used by the teachers.
