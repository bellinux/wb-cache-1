5|$|In mid-August, Yost moved Braun {{from third}} in the batting order to cleanup, {{switching}} him with Prince Fielder.

Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non-violence, so can anyone who follows this path.|$|E

However, Senter did not test whether the strong curvature of dromaeosaurid claws was also <b>conducive</b> <b>to</b> such activities.|$|E

5|$|Manual {{removal of}} the Japanese {{knotweed}} has preserved heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern. Early hand pruning was <b>conducive</b> <b>to</b> orchids.

The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and liquorice milkvetch. Common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing. The low dry-stone walls probably favored the installation of viviparous lizard or common wall lizard, observed in 2013, but also the consolidation of the hart's-tongue fern population.|$|E
