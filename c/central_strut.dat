40|$|Numerical {{investigations}} of a hydrogen-fueled scramjet combustor at cruise §ight conditions of Mach 8 {{at an altitude}} of 30 km have been per-formed. Two combustor con¦gurations were investigated: a single-stage combustor with a <b>central</b> <b>strut</b> injector and a two-staged combustor com-bining the <b>central</b> <b>strut</b> and wall-mounted ramp injectors. These numeri-cal simulations are aimed to study the §ow structure, supersonic mixing, autoignition, and combustion for the present combustor con¦gurations. A turbulent §ow from a separate intake calculation was used as in§ow condition for the combustor. A better performance for the two-staged combustor con¦guration was observed. The combination of the <b>central</b> <b>strut</b> injection together with the wall-ramp injection improved the tur-bulent mixing and, consequently, the combustion process. Inside the supersonic combustion chamber, the autoignition zone occurred down-stream of the injectors, and combustion takes place accompanied by high heat release and pressure rise. As the equivalence ratio was increased, the combustion became stronger causing an upstream displacement of the shock train producing di¨erent pressure variations. For the two-staged combustor con¦guration, the location of the autoignition zone was found to appear further upstream compared to single-stage combustor. Mixing was improved by addition of the second-stage injection. The in§uence of the wall temperature was also investigated showing an e¨ect on the combustion pressure rise and the length and location of the shock train. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) reacting flow in a staged supersonic combustor {{is examined}} numerically. In {{order to obtain}} the optimum stream-wise vortices, a swept ramp injector is chosen as the second-stage wall injection combined with the first-stage <b>central</b> <b>strut</b> injection. The performance of the two-staged injection is {{compared with that of}} a one-staged injection, while the strut is kept installed in both cases. The two-staged injections can make full use of the residual oxygen near the wall and release more heat. The second-stage injection further downstream avoids the strong shock waves in the isolator and results in a rising wall pressure and good burning effects after the wall injection. Therefore, it allows more fuel to be injected into the supersonic combustor without causing thermal choking. Parallel injection from the second-stage swept ramp shows low total pressure loss and the best burning efficiency, compared with the other injection angles...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{numerical}} {{study of}} the inlet-combustor interaction and flow structure through a scramjet engine at a flight Mach number M = 7 (Hypersonic Combustion) is presented. The scramjet configuration incorporates an inlet with an 8 degree compression ramp, followed by an isolator, and a divergent combustor. Fuel is injected at supersonic speed (M= 2) through a <b>central</b> <b>strut</b> injector. The shape of the strut is chosen {{in a way to}} produce strong stream wise vorticity and thus to enhance the hydrogen/air mixing. To investigate the influence of the central injector on the flow behavior, reacting cases have been studied. For the reacting cases, the shock wave pattern is modified due to the strong heat release during combustion process. The shock structure and combustion phenomenon are not only affected by the geometry, but also by the flight Mach number and the trajectory. The k-ε realizable computations are capable of predicting mixing and combustion simulations well and good. For all reacting cases, fuel-air stoichiometric conditions are used. Index Terms—.

40|$|Extension of {{scramjet}} operation {{into the}} hypervelocity regime (u > 3 km/s, M > 10) {{is critical for}} their use in access-to-space systems. As flight speeds increase, the net thrust of a scramjet engine is limited by increased fuel/air mixing length requirements, {{as well as the}} decreased ratio of energy available from stoichiometric fuel/air combustion relative to the specific kinetic energy of the captured air. One possible method for addressing these issues, known as oxygen enrichment, involves the premixing of oxygen with fuel before injection. This method provides a head start for mixing and also allows the possibility of fuel combustion at greater than stoichiometric proportions. This paper describes some exploratory shock tunnel experiments involving oxygen enrichment of gaseous hydrogen fuel in a scramjet at hypervelocity conditions. These experiments were conducted in a simple rectangular duct with a <b>central</b> <b>strut</b> injector and varying levels of enrichment. The measured pressure distributions show a positive effect of enrichment and indicate how this technique could be best used to extend the performance of hypervelocity scramjets to higher flight Mach number.

50|$|It was an all-wood aircraft, a {{parasol wing}} monoplane.

A pair of flying wires on each side ran from a <b>central,</b> four <b>strut</b> pylon above the wing central section and three more pairs ran from the lower fuselage longerons to the wing undersides.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the {{comparison}} between experiments and numerical simulations for a generic Scram- jet configuration are been presented. The experiments have been conducted for a Mach 7 condition at the hypersonic blow down wind tunnel H 2 K at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Cologne. The cor- responding numerical simulations have been performed using two different numerical solvers. During the experiments, air was injected through <b>central</b> <b>strut</b> and wall-ramp injectors to simulate a combustion back- pressure. In order to generate a database for a comparison between numerical and experimental data, wall pressures were measured along the bottom and top side walls, Pitot pressure at the exit of the combustor, and heat ux on the sidewalls. The reasonable good agreement between the experiments and the numerical solutions show the feasibility of the numerical tools to predict complex ow structures in high-speed ows. Furthermore, an extrapolation of the numerical and experimental data to real ight conditions {{at an altitude of}} 30 km was undertaken and the feasibility of the proposed Scramjet configuration is been shown...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the study of a fin-body {{junction}} flow {{in the context of an}} internal scramjet flowpath. Threedimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes numerical simulations of the flowfield inside a particular scramjet configuration have been performed using the commercial computational fluid dynamics code CFD++. The junction is formed by a <b>central</b> <b>strut</b> fuel injector spanning the entrance to a direct-connect combustor. The local flow Mach number is 2. 5. The bow shock generated by the blunt strut injector causes flow separation on the side wall, which leads to the formation of horseshoe vortices. The computed results in the symmetry plane and on the injector surface near the leading edge of the strut are in good agreement with the solutions obtained by other investigators for isolated fin-body junctions. Further downstream, reflections of the strut bow shock at the internal flow top wall and then the strut surface have significant effect on the propagation of the fin-body interaction. The shock-vortex interaction was found to despin the primary horseshoe vortex; i. e., oppositely orientated vorticity is induced, and hence dissipate vorticity. Further reduction of the vorticity, associated with the observed vortices, occurs due to viscous dissipation of the horseshoe vortices in the internal flow side wall boundary layer...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} high Mach number free shear layers has been undertaken. The experiments were performed using a Mach 7 gun tunnel facility and a planar duct with injection {{from the base}} of a <b>central</b> <b>strut</b> producing a Mach 3 flow parallel to the gun tunnel stream. This configuration is relevant to the development of efficient scramjet propulsion, and the gun tunnel Mach number is significantly higher than the majority of previous supersonic turbulent mixing layer investigations reported in the open literature. Schlieren images and Pitot pressure measurements were obtained at four different convective Mach numbers ranging from 0 to 1. 8. Only small differences between the four cases were detected, and the relatively large high-speed boundary layers at the trailing edge of the struct injector appear to strongly influence the shear layer development in each case. The Pitot pressure measurements indicated that, on average, the free shear layers all spread into the Mach 3 stream at an angle of approximately 1. 4 degrees, while virtually no spreading into the Mach 7 stream was detected until all of the low-speed stream was entrained. The free shear layers were simulated using a PNS code; however, the experimentally observed degree of spreading rate asymmetry could not be fully predicted with the k-epsilon turbulence model, even when a recently proposed compressibility correction was applied...|$|E
