25|$|Since Everett's {{original}} work, {{there have}} appeared {{a number of}} similar formalisms in the literature. One such is the relative state formulation. It makes two assumptions: first, the wavefunction {{is not simply a}} description of the object's state, but that it actually is entirely equivalent to the object, a claim it has in common with some other interpretations. Secondly, observation or measurement has no special laws or mechanics, unlike in the Copenhagen interpretation which considers the wavefunction collapse as a special kind of event which occurs as a result of observation. Instead, measurement in the relative state formulation is the consequence of a <b>configuration</b> <b>change</b> in the memory of an observer described by the same basic wave physics as the object being modeled.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{design and}} analyze {{communication}} algorithms for an optical switch {{based on the}} electroholographic effect, that provides capabilities for <b>configuration</b> <b>changes</b> and a limited multicast. As <b>configuration</b> <b>changes</b> incur a high overhead, we suggest {{the use of a}} high-speed forwarding unit as part of the network interface. We develop broadcast algorithms that trade off the number of <b>configuration</b> <b>changes</b> and forwarding operations in order to achieve the minimal completion time. For general pointto-point communication, we use the limited multicast to create a spanning topology along which messages can be forwarded. This requires care to avoid collisions, but is still preferable to using <b>configuration</b> <b>changes</b> if the topology is rich enough but still has a low degree...|$|R

50|$|Deploying to {{production}} {{is the most}} sensitive step; it may be done by deploying new code directly (overwriting old code, so only one copy is present at a time), or by deploying a <b>configuration</b> <b>change.</b> This can take various forms: deploying a parallel installation of {{a new version of}} code, and switching between them with a configuration change; deploying a new version of code with the old behavior and a feature flag, and switching to the new behavior with a <b>configuration</b> <b>change</b> that performs a flag flip; or by deploying separate servers (one running the old code, one the new) and redirecting traffic from old to new with a <b>configuration</b> <b>change</b> at the traffic routing level. These in turn may be done all at once or gradually, in phases.|$|E

These policies define who is allowed to change what aspects of the configuration of a computer infrastructure. Although many system configuration tools are available for automating <b>configuration</b> <b>changes</b> in an infrastructure, very little work has been done to enforce the policies dealing with access control and workflow of <b>configuration</b> <b>changes.</b> In this paper, we present ACHEL. ACHEL makes it possible to integrate fine-grained access control into existing configuration tools and to enforce an organization’s <b>configuration</b> <b>changes</b> workflow. In addition, we prototype ACHEL on a popular configuration tool and demonstrate its capabilities in two case studies. ...|$|R
