In {{order to}} reduce casting defects and improve casting quality, the author has {{developed}} a three-dimensional parallel vibration <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> based on parallel mechanism. The paper introduces the three-dimensional parallel vibration <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> in structure composition and functional properties, the <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> degree of freedom of excitation mechanism is calculated, its motion performance is analyzed, and the kinematics equations are established. The designed <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> achieves support and excitation functional separation of moving parts which takes complete decoupling of hybrid mechanism 2 PRRR-P (2 R) as excitation mechanism, realizing flask vibration along the X, Y, Z three directions. Test results show that, the <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> can significantly improve casting quality, raise labor productivity, save casting raw materials, and reduce the production costs...|$|R

40|$|Continuous casting is a {{dominant}} production technology of steelmaking {{which is currently}} used for more that 95 % of the world steel production. Mathematical modelling and optimal control of <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> are crucial tasks in continuous steel casting which directly influence productivity and quality of produced steel, competitiveness of steelworks, safety of <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> operation {{and its impact on}} the environment. This thesis concerns with the development and implementation of the numerical model of temperature field for continuously cast steel billets and its use for optimal control of the <b>casting</b> <b>machine.</b> The numerical model was developed and implemented in MATLAB. Due to computational demands the model was parallelized by means of the computation on graphics processing units NVIDIA with the computational architecture CUDA. Validation and verification of the model were performed with the use of operational data from Trinecke zelezarny steelworks. The model was then utilized as a part of the developed model-based predictive control system for the optimal control of dynamic situations in the <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> operation. The behaviour of the developed control system was examined by means of dynamic model situations that have confirmed the ability of the implemented system to optimally control dynamic operations of the continuous <b>casting</b> <b>machine.</b> Both the numerical model of the temperature field and the model-based predictive control system have been implemented so that they can be modified for any <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> and this allows for their prospective commercial applications...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of bridge orientation in <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> on castability and quality of base metal castings. Methods: Three groups of patterns with different direction and lengths in <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> were <b>casted</b> and then studied qualitatively and quantitatively using mean and standard deviation in table of frequency. Results: Larger nodules and porosities were on the joints of sprue in horizontal specimens (P= 0. 01 and 0. 048, respectively). There was no significant difference in castability between 3 -, 5 - and 6 -unit bridges in relation to their direction in <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> (P= 0. 5). An increase in bridge length led to more variation in length and width. The position of bridges also played an important role in the length variation in bridges. Conclusion: The direction of bridges had no effect on base metal castability but a vertical position resulted in a better casting quality and an increase in length of the bridges caused more defects in castings...|$|R
