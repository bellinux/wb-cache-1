50|$|Note that {{coherence}} {{of a given}} unit depends on {{the definition of the}} base units. Should the meter's definition change such that it is shorter by a factor of , then the bar would be a <b>coherent</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit.</b> However, a coherent unit remains coherent (and a non-coherent unit remains non-coherent) if the base units are redefined in terms of other units with the numerical factor always being unity.|$|E
50|$|A {{variant of}} this system applies the unit s2/ft to the {{proportionality}} constant. This {{has the effect of}} identifying the pound-force with the pound. The pound is then both a base unit of mass and a <b>coherent</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of force. One may apply any unit one pleases to the proportionality constant. If one applies the unit s2/lb to it, then the foot becomes a unit of force. In a four-unit system (English engineering units), the pound and the pound-force are distinct base units, and the proportionality constant has the unit lbf·s2/(lb·ft).|$|E

50|$|A <b>coherent</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> {{is defined}} as a derived unit that, for a given system of {{quantities}} and for a chosen set of base units, is a product of powers of base units with no other proportionality factor than one. The concept of coherence was developed in the mid-nineteenth century by, amongst others, Kelvin and James Clerk Maxwell and promoted by the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The concept was initially applied to the centimetre-gram-second (CGS) and the foot-pound-second systems (FPS) of units in 1873 and 1875 respectively. The International System of Units (1960) was designed around the system of coherence.|$|E
5000|$|Velocity is a {{physical}} vector quantity; both magnitude and direction are needed to define it. The scalar absolute value (magnitude) of velocity is called [...] "speed", being a <b>coherent</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> whose quantity is measured in the SI (metric system) as metres per second (m/s) or as the SI base unit of (m⋅s−1). For example, [...] "5 metres per second" [...] is a scalar, whereas [...] "5 metres per second east" [...] is a vector. If there {{is a change in}} speed, direction or both, then the object has a changing velocity and is said to be undergoing an acceleration.|$|E
5000|$|Non-commensurable {{quantities}} {{have different}} physical dimensions {{which means that}} adding or subtracting them is not meaningful. For instance, adding the mass of an object to its volume has no physical meaning. However, new quantities (and, as such, units) can be derived via multiplication and exponentiation of other units. As an example, the SI unit for force is the newton, which is defined as kg·m·s−2. Since a <b>coherent</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> is one which is defined by means of multiplication and exponentiation of other units but not multiplied by any scaling factor, the pascal is a coherent unit of pressure (defined as kg·m−1·s−2), but the bar (defined as [...] kg·m−1·s−2) is not.|$|E
5|$|<b>Coherent</b> <b>units</b> are <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> {{that contain}} no {{numerical}} factor other than 1—quantities such as standard gravity and density of water are absent from their definitions. In the example above, one newton is the force required to accelerate {{a mass of}} one kilogram by one metre per second squared. Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m·s−2 respectively and , the units of force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give kg·m·s−2. Since the newton {{is part of a}} coherent set of units, the constant of proportionality is 1.|$|R
5|$|The <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> in the SI {{are formed}} by powers, {{products}} or quotients {{of the base}} units and are unlimited in number. <b>Derived</b> <b>units</b> are associated with derived quantities, for example velocity is a quantity that {{is derived from the}} base quantities of time and length, so in SI the <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> is metres per second (symbol m/s). The dimensions of <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> can be expressed in terms of the dimensions of the base units.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Derived</b> <b>units</b> {{which are}} formed by {{operating}} on base units or combinations of base <b>units</b> and other <b>derived</b> <b>units.</b> For example, a C# tuning fork vibrates 261.6 times per second and therefore has a frequency of 261.6 {{cycles per second}} or 261.6 hertz. In this instance [...] "hertz" [...] is a <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> as it is automatically defined from {{the definition of the}} second. Other <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> might be built up from one or more base units.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} example concerns {{definitions of}} quantities and units. The (average) velocity (v) {{of an object}} {{is defined as the}} quantitative physical property of the object that is directly proportional to the distance (d) traveled by the object and inversely proportional to the time (t) of travel, i.e., v = kd/t, where k is a constant that depends on the units used. Suppose that the meter (m) and the second (s) are base units; then the kilometer (km) and the hour (h) are noncoherent derived units. The meter per second (mps) is defined as the velocity of an object that travels one meter in one second, and the kilometer per hour (kmph) is defined as the velocity of an object that travels one kilometer in one hour. Substituting from the definitions of the units into the defining equation of velocity we obtain, 1 mps = k m/s and 1 kmph = k km/h = 1/3.6 k m/s = 1/3.6 mps. Now choose k = 1; then the meter per second is a <b>coherent</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit,</b> and the kilometer per hour is a noncoherent derived unit. Suppose that we choose to use the kilometer per hour as the unit of velocity in the system. Then the system becomes noncoherent, and the numerical value equation for velocity becomes {v} = 3.6 {d}/{t}. Coherence may be restored, without changing the units, by choosing k = 3.6; then the kilometer per hour is a <b>coherent</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit,</b> with 1 kmph = 1 m/s, and the meter per second is a noncoherent derived unit, with 1 mps = 3.6 m/s.|$|E
50|$|Asimov's {{conclusion}} {{is not the}} only possible one. In a system that uses the units foot (ft) for length, second (s) for time, pound (lb) for mass, and pound-force (lbf) for force, the law relating force (F), mass (m), and acceleration (a) is F = 0.031081 ma. Since the proportionality constant here is dimensionless and the units in any equation must balance without any numerical factor other than one, it follows that 1 lbf = 1 lb·ft/s2. This conclusion appears paradoxical {{from the point of view}} of competing systems, according to which F = ma and 1 lbf = 32.174 lb·ft/s2. Although the pound-force is a <b>coherent</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> in this system according to the official definition, the system itself is not considered to be coherent because of the presence of the proportionality constant in the force law.|$|E
40|$|The {{definition}} of coherent derived {{units in the}} International System of Units (SI) is reviewed, and {{the important role of}} the equations defining physical quantities is emphasized in obtaining coherent derived units. In the case of the dimensionless quantity plane angle, the choice between alternative definitions is considered, leading to a corresponding choice between alternative definitions of the <b>coherent</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> - the radian, degree or revolution. In this case the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) has chosen to adopt the definition that leads to the radian as the <b>coherent</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> in the SI. In the case of the quantity logarithmic decay (or gain), also sometimes called decrement, and sometimes called level, a similar choice of defining equation exists, leading to a corresponding choice for the <b>coherent</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> - the neper or the bel. In this case the CGPM has not yet made a choice. We argue that for the quantity logarithmic decay the most logical choice of defining equation is linked to that of the radian, and is that which leads to the neper as the corresponding <b>coherent</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit.</b> This should not prevent us from using the bel and decibel as units of logarithmic decay. However, it {{is an important part of}} the SI to establish in a formal sense the equations defining physical quantities, and the corresponding coherent derived units. ...|$|E

5000|$|Many <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> do {{not have}} special names. For example, the SI <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of area is the square metre (m2) and the SI <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of density is the {{kilogram}} per cubic metre (kg/m3 or kg m−3). However, 22 <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> are recognized by the SI with special names, which are written in lowercase. However, the symbols for units named after persons, are always written with an uppercase initial letter. For example, the symbol for the hertz is [...] "Hz"; but the symbol for the metre is [...] "m".|$|R
50|$|The SI {{includes}} {{two classes of}} units which are defined and agreed internationally.
