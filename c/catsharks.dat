5|$|Carcharhiniformes: Commonly {{known as}} ground sharks, the order {{includes}} the blue, tiger, bull, grey reef, blacktip reef, Caribbean reef, blacktail reef, whitetip reef, and oceanic whitetip sharks (collectively called the requiem sharks) {{along with the}} houndsharks, <b>catsharks,</b> and hammerhead sharks. They are distinguished by an elongated snout and a nictitating membrane which protects the eyes during an attack.|$|E
5|$|Shark fin soup is {{a status}} symbol in Asian countries, and is {{considered}} healthy and full of nutrients. Sharks are also killed for meat. European diners consume dogfishes, smoothhounds, <b>catsharks,</b> makos, porbeagle and also skates and rays. However, the U.S. FDA lists sharks as one of four fish (with swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish) whose high mercury content is hazardous to children and pregnant women.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy fishing {{pressure}} {{within its}} range, the cloudy catshark remains common, {{perhaps because it}} may be more biologically productive than most other sharks. As a result, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Cloudy <b>catsharks</b> from a number of locations off Japan {{have been found to be}} contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDEs), which they acquire from their food. One likely source of these pollutants is the use of the pesticide DDT by developing nations in southern Asia.|$|E
50|$|The dwarf <b>catshark,</b> Scyliorhinus torrei, is a <b>catshark,</b> {{belonging}} to the family Scyliorhinidae. It is found {{off the coast of}} southern Florida, the Bahamas, and Cuba and is also known as the whitespotted <b>catshark</b> and Cuban <b>catshark.</b>|$|R
50|$|The New Caledonia <b>catshark</b> or Kanakorum <b>catshark</b> (Aulohalaelurus kanakorum) is a <b>catshark</b> of {{the family}} Scyliorhinidae in the order Carcharhiniformes, known only from one {{specimen}} collected near southwestern New Caledonia in the western central Pacific Ocean. The holotype measured 79 cm. The New Caledonia <b>catshark</b> is a rare and vulnerable inshore <b>catshark</b> found around coral reefs.|$|R
50|$|The Comoro <b>catshark,</b> Scyliorhinus comoroensis, {{is a rare}} <b>catshark</b> of {{the family}} Scyliorhinidae. The holotype and only {{specimen}} {{was taken from the}} Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean, at a depth of 400 m. The Comoro <b>catshark</b> is not well-documented. The reproduction of this <b>catshark</b> is oviparous.|$|R
5|$|Mating {{has rarely}} been {{observed}} in sharks. The smaller <b>catsharks</b> often mate with the male curling around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim {{parallel to each other}} while the male inserts a clasper into the female's oviduct. Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating. The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior: the male may bite the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.|$|E
5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, tuna and mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including mullets, porgies, grunts, and flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, <b>catsharks,</b> thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller requiem sharks, sawfish, guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} {{is a member}} of the order Carcharhiniformes, the most species-rich order of sharks, with more than 270 species also {{including}} the small <b>catsharks</b> and hammerhead sharks. Members of this order are characterized by the presence of a nictitating membrane over the eyes, two dorsal fins, an anal fin, and five gill slits. It is the largest member of the Carcharhinidae family, commonly referred to as requiem sharks. This family consists of mostly slender but powerful mid- to large-sized sharks and includes some other well-known sharks, such as the blue shark (Prionace glauca), lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris), and bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas).|$|E
50|$|The spatulasnout <b>catshark</b> or Borneo <b>catshark</b> (Apristurus platyrhynchus) is a <b>catshark</b> of {{the family}} Scyliorhinidae, found in the western Pacific between 35°N and 1° N. Its length is up to 80 cm.|$|R

50|$|The Panama ghost <b>catshark</b> (Apristurus stenseni) is {{a lesser}} known <b>catshark</b> {{of the family}} Scyliorhinidae. This <b>catshark</b> is only found off Panama, between 9°N and 2°N. The {{reproduction}} of the Panama ghost shark is oviparous.|$|R
5|$|Though the pigeye shark {{will take}} prey from {{anywhere}} in the water column, it tends to hunt close to the sea floor. An apex predator, it feeds mainly on teleost fishes such as croakers, flatfishes, and cutlassfishes, {{and to a lesser extent}} on cartilaginous fishes, cephalopods, and decapod crustaceans. It has also been recorded eating gastropods, sea snakes, dolphins, and whale carrion. Other sharks and rays figure much more prominently in the diets of South African pigeye sharks than those from other regions; the types consumed include requiem sharks, <b>catsharks,</b> angel sharks, guitarfishes, stingrays, and eagle rays.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the cloudy {{catshark}} adapts well to captivity and has {{reproduced in}} the aquarium. It {{is often used}} as a model organism in physiology research. On September 25, 1995, Masuda Motoyashi and colleagues used this species to perform the first successful artificial insemination of a shark or ray. The cloudy catshark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries with bottom fishing nets including trawls and gillnets, {{as well as on}} bottom longlines. Captured individuals are typically discarded, possibly with a high survival rate due to their hardiness. Some 40% of the fish discarded in Yamaguchi Prefecture fisheries are of this species. The bottom trawl fishery operating off Fukushima Prefecture may catch over a ton of cloudy <b>catsharks</b> annually, which are also discarded.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, {{only a few}} {{benthic species}} of shark, such as hornsharks, leopard sharks and <b>catsharks,</b> had survived in {{aquarium}} conditions {{for a year or}} more. This gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. More knowledge has led to more species (including the large pelagic sharks) living far longer in captivity, along with safer transportation techniques that have enabled long distance transportation. For a long time, the great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long, but in September 2004, the Monterey Bay Aquarium successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her.|$|E
50|$|The Saldanha <b>catshark</b> (Apristurus saldanha) is {{a species}} of <b>catshark,</b> {{belonging}} to the family Scyliorhinidae. This <b>catshark</b> is found from Cape Columbine to south of False Bay in South Africa, between 31 and 40°S. Its length is up to 88 cm. It is a plain, dark grey-brown, stout <b>catshark,</b> with moderately large eyes, a broad snout, and large pectoral fins.|$|R
50|$|The smalleye <b>catshark</b> (Apristurus microps) is a <b>catshark</b> of {{the family}} Scyliorhinidae, found in the {{southeast}} Atlantic at depths between 700 and 2,000 m. It can grow up to 61 cm. The reproduction of this <b>catshark</b> is oviparous.|$|R
50|$|The Jaguar <b>catshark,</b> (Bythaelurus giddingsi) is {{a species}} of <b>catshark</b> from the Galápagos Islands. the species was first {{described}} in 2012. This <b>catshark</b> is about a foot long when mature, and it is colored blackish-brown with an asymmetrical pattern of light spots.|$|R
5|$|The blackmouth {{catshark}} is an active, generalist predator that feeds on both bottom-dwelling and free-swimming organisms. Its diet {{is dominated by}} decapods, krill, bony fishes (including lanternfishes, bristlemouths, dragonfishes, and moras), and cephalopods. The most significant prey species generally reflect what is most available in the environment, for example the shrimps Calocaris macandreae and Pasiphaea multidentata off southern France and the prawns Sergestes arcticus and Sergia robusta off the Iberian Peninsula. Juveniles consume a greater amount and variety of crustaceans than adults, including smaller types such as mysids and hyperiid amphipods. Adults favor relatively large fish prey and {{have been known to}} take other sharks and rays and smaller members of the same species. The importance of cephalopod prey across ages differs between regions. The stomachs of some blackmouth <b>catsharks</b> have found to contain pieces of animals too large for a single shark to overwhelm, suggesting that it may sometimes attack in groups. Scavenging has been infrequently documented, including of human refuse.|$|E
25|$|Brown <b>catsharks</b> feed on many bottom-dwelling species, {{including}} small shrimp, euphausiids, squid, {{and small}} fish. It is unknown whether brown <b>catsharks</b> are important predators within their ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|Redspotted <b>catsharks</b> are host to trypanosomes, parasites {{that are}} {{passed into the}} catsharks' {{bloodstream}} through leeches.|$|E
50|$|The orange-spotted <b>catshark,</b> or rusty <b>catshark</b> (Asymbolus rubiginosus), is {{a species}} of <b>catshark,</b> {{and part of the}} family Scyliorhinidae. It is found only off the coast of Western Australia, at depths between 25 and 540 m. Its length is up to 39 cm.|$|R
50|$|The brownspotted <b>catshark,</b> Scyliorhinus garmani, {{is a rare}} <b>catshark</b> of {{the family}} Scyliorhinidae, found in the Indo-West Pacific between latitudes 11° N and 12° S. Its {{juvenile}} length is about 38 cm, but its adult size is mostly unknown. The reproduction of this <b>catshark</b> is oviparous.|$|R
50|$|The hoary <b>catshark</b> (Apristurus canutus) is a <b>catshark</b> of {{the family}} Scyliorhinidae found in the western central Atlantic from the Leeward Islands off Antigua and Anguilla, at depths between 521 and 915 m. Its length is up to 45.5 cm. The {{reproduction}} of this <b>catshark</b> is oviparous.|$|R
25|$|Redspotted <b>catsharks</b> have a {{negative}} economic impact on humans. They feed heavily on near shore benthic crustaceans. This is a detriment to commercial fisherman because crustaceans in this area have a large economic importance. <b>Catsharks</b> are also a frequent bycatch of nearshore fishing trawlers, which, while not economically significant, can cause damage to nets as well as time lost in removing the bycatch from the viable catch.|$|E
25|$|Redspotted <b>catsharks</b> have multicuspid teeth. However, males {{typically}} have longer teeth with fewer cusps. This {{is believed to}} aid in courtship biting.|$|E
25|$|Brown <b>catsharks</b> are {{not listed}} as {{endangered}} on the IUCN Red List or the CITES list. They {{are not known}} to be a vulnerable or threatened species. They are, however, listed on the IUCN list as needing to be reclassified. The only known negative impact that brown <b>catsharks</b> have on humans is the frequent bycatch of deep-water fishing trawlers, which while not economically significant, can cause damage to nets, as well as time lost in removing the bycatch from the viable catch.|$|E
50|$|The dusky <b>catshark,</b> Bythaelurus canescens, is a <b>catshark</b> of {{the family}} Scyliorhinidae, found from Peru and Chile to the Straits of Magellan.|$|R

It {{is found in the}} eastern Atlantic between latitudes 20° N and 17° S, at depths between 45 and 500 m. It can grow up to a length of 80 cm. At one time, the West African <b>catshark</b> was {{considered}} to be a subspecies of the nursehound, Scyliorhinus stellaris, but is now considered to be a separate species. The reproduction of this <b>catshark</b> is oviparous.|$|R
50|$|The smallbelly <b>catshark</b> (Apristurus indicus) is a <b>catshark</b> of {{the family}} Scyliorhinidae found in the western Indian Ocean near Somalia, the Gulf of Aden, and Oman, at depths between 1,300 and 1,840 m. Its length is up to 34 cm, {{although}} this measurement is of an immature specimen. The smallbelly <b>catshark</b> is not well known. It is found on continental slopes, and is probably caught by bottom trawlers. The reproduction of the smallbelly <b>catshark</b> is oviparous.|$|R
25|$|Redspotted <b>catsharks</b> {{range in}} length from 30 to 66cm, {{although}} these sizes {{are taken from}} captured sharks, and {{it is believed that}} they may grow larger than this.|$|E
25|$|Redspotted <b>catsharks</b> are {{not listed}} as {{endangered}} on the IUCN Red List, the U.S. Federal List, or the CITES list. They {{are not known}} to be a vulnerable or threatened species.|$|E
25|$|Redspotted <b>catsharks</b> are , nocturnal creatures. They stay {{in caves}} and crevices {{during the day}} and emerge at night to feed. They are migratory. However, they live most of the year {{near the edge of the}} {{continental}} shelf.|$|E
50|$|The {{most widely}} {{distributed}} member of its genus, the coral <b>catshark</b> {{can be found}} from Pakistan and India to Southeast Asia and Taiwan, including the Philippines and New Guinea.
