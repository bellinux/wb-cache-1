25|$|As {{in other}} RTS games, air {{transports}} {{can be used}} to convey units to specified destinations, in Supreme Commander though by shift queuing orders a transport containing several units <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>ordered</b> to drop specific units at subsequent waypoints. An air transport can also be ordered to create a ferry route, an airbridge wherein any land units ordered {{to the start of the}} ferry route will be conveyed by the air transport to the specified destination. The output from a production factory can be routed to a ferry route causing all units constructed by that factory to be automatically ferried to the route's destination. Additional air transports <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>ordered</b> to assist an existing ferry route allowing many units to be efficiently transported.|$|E

50|$|Applying the order-extension {{principle}} to a partial {{order in which}} every two elements are incomparable shows that (under this principle) every set <b>can</b> <b>be</b> linearly <b>ordered.</b> This assertion that every set <b>can</b> <b>be</b> linearly <b>ordered</b> <b>is</b> known as the ordering principle, OP, and is a weakening of the well-ordering theorem.

25|$|Self-adjoint {{operators}} on a Hilbert space (for example, self-adjoint square complex matrices) generalize the reals in many respects: they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>ordered</b> (though {{not totally}} ordered), they are complete, all their eigenvalues are real and {{they form a}} real associative algebra.
