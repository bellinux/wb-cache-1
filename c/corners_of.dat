5|$|The upper tier is {{contoured}} {{to leave}} open {{space in the}} <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the ground, and the roof is significantly canted inwards. Both of these features are meant to provide as much airflow and sunlight to the pitch as possible. The stadium gives an illusion that supporters in the upper tier {{on one side of}} the ground are unable to see supporters in the upper tier opposite. As part of a deal with Sony, the stadium was the first in the world to incorporate HDTV streaming. In the north-west and south-east <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the stadium are two giant screens suspended from the roof.|$|E

5|$|Vanadinite is a lead {{chlorovanadate}} {{with the}} chemical formula Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It is composed (by weight) of 73.15% lead, 10.79% vanadium, 13.56% oxygen, and 2.50% chlorine. Each structural unit of vanadinite contains a chlorine ion surrounded by six divalent lead ions at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a regular octahedron, {{with one of}} the lead ions provided by an adjoining vanadinite molecule. The distance between each lead and chlorine ion is 317picometres. The shortest distance between each lead ion is 4.48Å. The octahedron shares two of its opposite faces with that of neighbouring vanadinite units, forming a continuous chain of octahedrons. Each vanadium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> an irregular tetrahedron. The distance between each oxygen and vanadium atom is either 1.72 or 1.76Å. Three oxygen tetrahedrons adjoin each of the lead octahedrons along the chain.|$|E
5|$|A {{solution}} to the minimax path problem between the two opposite <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a grid graph {{can be used to}} find the weak Fréchet distance between two polygonal chains. Here, each grid graph vertex represents a pair of line segments, one from each chain, and the weight of an edge represents the Fréchet distance needed to pass from one pair of segments to another.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} twenty-nine monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates (que) from the Han dynasty have survived {{and can be}} found in the {{aboveground}} areas around Han tomb and shrine sites. They often formed part of outer walls, usually flanking an entry but sometimes at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> walled enclosures. Although they lack wooden and ceramic components, they feature imitation roof tiles, eaves, porches, and balustrades.|$|E

5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} {{alveolar}} cell and an alveolar macrophage. The two types of cell are known as type I and type II alveolar cells (also known as pneumocytes). Types I and II make up the walls and alveolar septa. Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), and Type II cells generally cluster in the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E
5|$|As for {{the most}} clues {{possible}} in a Sudoko while still not rendering a unique solution, it is four short of a full grid (77). If two instances of two numbers each are missing and the cells they are to occupy are the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> an orthogonal rectangle, and exactly two of these cells are within one region, {{there are two ways}} the last digits can be added (two solutions).|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, Arsenal's {{season ticket}} waiting list stood at 40,000 people. The {{potential}} for expanding the stadium {{is a common}} topic within fan debate. Potential expansion methods include, make seats smaller, filling in the dips in the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the stadium though this would block airflow, and replacing the roof with a third level and building a new roof. There has also been discussion on the implementation of safe standing.|$|E
