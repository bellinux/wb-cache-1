40|$|Can African-American <b>congregations</b> succeed where big {{government}} has failed? Are African-American <b>congregations</b> providing services {{that will help}} individuals and their families lead self-sufficient and productive lives? Are African-American <b>congregations</b> providing more social services than other <b>congregations?</b> Questions that once only seemed important to African-American <b>congregations</b> and African-American communities have become essential for understanding private sector social welfare provision {{with the passage of}} the Personal Responsibility and Work Reconciliation Act of 1996 - PL 104 - 193. This legislation, called the Welfare Reform Law, marked a change in welfare services from an entitlement program to a temporary assistance program with a provision that encourages states to contract with faith-based and community-based organizations to provide social services. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the social service patterns and resource capacity of African-American <b>congregations</b> as social service providers when compared to other <b>congregations.</b> ^ This study examined the social service involvement provided by African-American <b>congregations</b> as compared to interracial and white <b>congregations.</b> Data from Cnaan 2 ̆ 7 s study of 251 <b>congregations</b> in seven cities (Chicago, IL; Houston, TX; Indianapolis, IN; New York City; Mobile, AL; Philadelphia, PA; and San Francisco, CA), as well as my study of 17 <b>congregations</b> in the historic all-black town of Boley, OK, supported the argument that African-American <b>congregations</b> were more involved than their interracial and white counterparts in providing social services across a wide array of areas. African-American <b>congregations</b> were more involved in basic need services, health services (especially health education and drug and alcohol services), community development services (especially housing and community security), and advocacy services. ^ While these findings suggest that African-American <b>congregations</b> participate in a broader range of social services than interracial and white <b>congregations,</b> the scale and financial capacity of African-American <b>congregations</b> appears to be overestimated. This study calls for future research to examine the scale, capacity, human resource usage, and collaborations of <b>congregations</b> to refine the understanding of the social service involvement of African-American <b>congregations.</b> ...|$|R
