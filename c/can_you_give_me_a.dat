6000|$|... "Miss Mohun, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> few minutes?" [...] said she, as {{the trim}} little figure emerged {{from beneath the}} copper beeches, basket in hand.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Violet, I {{have caught}} you at home. I'm {{come to town}} about Lord St. Erme's business--go back by the mail train. Are you dining at home? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> dinner?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well," [...] {{the young man}} protested, [...] "but <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> single solid reason why, {{considering}} I am {{in love with the}} girl, I shouldn't go and call upon her? Who is this Mr. Grex, anyway?" ...|$|E
60|$|SIR WILLIAM. [Genially] <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> {{another five}} minutes, Bill? [Pointing to the billiard-room] We'll come directly, my dear.|$|R
60|$|Atten. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> no {{examples}} of Gods wrath upon men that have acted this tragical wicked deed Mr. Badman.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, Jules, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> {{any advice}} {{whatever}} {{as to how}} to set about my scheme of getting them both out of prison?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} {{something}} of this," [...] said the stranger, deepening {{his voice and}} averting his head. [...] "I have some interest in the family, and would willingly help them if I could. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> bed in your house to-night, my friend?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] {{said the}} man in a half-apologetic tone. Then in brisker accents, [...] "The very thing I want! I say, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> bit of it? The ring of my saddle girth has fetched loose. I can fasten it with that." ...|$|E
6000|$|That night I {{went to a}} {{hotel in}} the city, and said to the clerk: [...] "What I need is {{absolute}} rest and exercise. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> room {{with one of those}} tall folding beds in it, and a relay of bellboys to work it up and down while I rest?" ...|$|E
6000|$|THE BURGLAR. Well, you've {{got them}} back, lady, haven't <b>you?</b> <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> back {{the years of}} my life you are going to take from me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True," [...] said Douglas, hastily {{putting down}} {{his hat and}} {{advancing}} a step. [...] "You cannot plead misunderstanding now. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> the assurance I seek?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know," [...] said Dean significantly; [...] "you {{need not}} recall that just now. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> {{the name and}} address of the family in Pimlico?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By my father's beard, {{you are a}} {{man after}} my own heart," [...] exclaimed the prince; [...] "and since thou dealest in talismans, Hakim, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> charm that you will secure me a meeting with this Epirot rebel within the term, so that I may keep my oath. What say you? what say you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will drop}} it for to-night, Geoffrey," [...] he said. [...] "But I {{am not the}} less resolved, {{in spite of all}} that you have said, to return to the subject to-morrow. It would save me some inconvenience--a second journey here from town, and then going back again to my engagements--if I staid with you to-night. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> bed?" ...|$|E
60|$|Q. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> Scripture {{instance}} {{to make this}} out?--A. Yes; Esau never intended for ever to part with the blessing, he intended to have it hereafter; but God counted his not choosing of it at present, a despising of it, and a preferring of his lusts before it: and therefore when he would, God would not, but reject both him and his tears (Gen 25:30-34; Heb 12:14-16).|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Miss Clibborn, how sad it is {{to think}} that your {{affections}} should be unrequited. Why am I not Captain Parsons? Miss Clibborn, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> no hope?" ...|$|R
6000|$|A feeling, irresistible in its impulse, induced me to reply--"Ah! Diana, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> {{advice to}} leave Osbaldistone Hall?--then indeed I {{have already been}} a {{resident}} here too long!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but now I want to hunt them. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> any help? Those oxen {{are tired}} out and footsore, so {{we might be}} able to catch them up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The very same, God bless you, Mr. Woolston, for I {{now know}} your voice, too. I'm Bill, and right down glad am I to have things turn out so. I half {{suspected}} {{the truth when}} I saw a ship's spars this afternoon in this place, though little did I think, yesterday, of ever seeing anything more of the old 'Cocus. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> cast across this bit of a ferry, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] he {{continued}} amiably, [...] "there {{is no need}} for us to quarrel, I hope. We all look at things differently in this world, and, fortunately, the matter which I want to discuss with you lies right outside the operations of the B. & I. When <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> few moments of your time, Mr. Wingate? Will you call around at our offices, Number 13 Throgmorton Street, next Tuesday morning at, say? eleven-thirty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘One {{thing more}} there is,’ said Pelias, ‘on which I need your advice; for, {{though you are}} young, I see in you a wisdom beyond your years. There is one {{neighbour}} of mine, whom I dread more than all men on earth. I am stronger than he now, and can command him; but I know that if he stay among us, he will work my ruin in the end. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> plan, Jason, by which I can rid myself of that man?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's so dark, so lonely," [...] she faltered. [...] "How do I know... what warrant <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> that you--that no harm will befall me if I go farther?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Armed {{with this}} resolution, Christie went {{the next day}} to Mr. Power, and simply said: [...] "I am not needed at the Sterlings any more: <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> other work to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} over that sweet subject, the sugars, Miles," [...] {{commenced}} my cousin, [...] "and {{approve of the}} plan. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> any further security if I will lend you the money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir Peregrine {{turned away}} and walked twice {{the length of the}} library; then, {{returning}} to the spot where the other stood, {{he put his hand on}} his grandson's shoulder. [...] "Well, Peregrine, I will pay them," [...] he said. [...] "I have no doubt that you did so intend when you incurred them;--and that was perhaps natural. I will pay them; but for your own sake, and for your dear mother's sake, I hope that they are not very heavy. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> list of all that you owe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Off went Tom; {{but before}} he could catch any {{eligible}} partner, Polly was provided with the best dancer in the room. Mr. Sydney had seen and heard the whole thing; and though he had laughed quietly, he liked honest Tom and good-natured Polly all the better for their simplicity. Polly's foot was keeping time to the lively music, and her eyes were fixed wistfully on the smoothly-gliding couples before her, when Mr. Sydney came to her, saying, in the pleasant yet respectful way she liked so much, [...] "Miss Polly, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> turn?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Henry {{is a fine}} boy, but John is {{very like}} his mama. Henry is the eldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second, is named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I thought very pretty of her. And {{he is a very}} clever boy, indeed. They are all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will come and stand by my chair, and say, 'Grandpapa, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> bit of string?' and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with them very often." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am myself again, Mr. Macrae,' said Logan, smiling. 'After all, we {{are living}} in the twentieth century, not the sixteenth, worse luck! And now <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> your {{attention}} for a few minutes?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{a shrewd}} reasoner," [...] said he. [...] "We will suppose for the instant that <b>you</b> are right. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> no hint what means you would adopt to attain this very {{desirable}} end?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} my supper {{up here in}} the dining-hall. The logs are laid and we can light the fire. You will call me if there is any alarm. What <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> for supper--you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The whole will {{conclude}} with considerations {{of the value}} of the work, or its practical utility in scientific investigations (especially the first part, which contains the strictly demonstrative reasonings, and the analysis of all the acts and passions of the mind which may be employed to the discovery of truth) in the arts of healing, especially in those parts that contain a catalogue, etc. of probable reasoning; lastly, to the senate, the pulpit, and our law courts, to whom the whole--but especially the latter three-fourths of the work, on the probable and the false--will be useful, and finally instructive, how to form a commonplace book by the aid of this Instrument, so as to read with practical advantage, and (supposing average talents) to 'ensure' a facility and rapidity in proving and in computing. I have thus amply detailed the contents of my work, which has not been the labour of one year or of two, but the result of many years' meditations, and of very various reading. The size of the work will, printed at thirty lines a page, form one volume octavo, 500 pages to the volume; and I shall be ready with the first half of the work for the printer at a fortnight's notice. Now, my dear friend, give me your thoughts on the subject: would you have me to offer it to the booksellers, or, by the assistance of my friends, print and publish on my own account? If the former, would you advise me to sell the copyright at once, or only one or more editions? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> general notion what terms I have a right to insist on in either case? And, lastly, to whom would you advise me to apply? Phillips is a pushing man, and a book is sure to have fair play if it be his 'property'; and it could not be other than pleasant to me to have the same publisher with yourself, 'but'----. Now if there be anything of impatience, that whether truth and justice ought to follow that [...] "'but'" [...] you will inform me. It is not my habit to go to work so seriously about matters of pecuniary business; but my ill health makes my life more than ordinarily uncertain, and I have a wife and three little ones. If your judgment leads you to advise me to offer it to Phillips, would you take the trouble of talking with him on the subject, and give him your real opinion, whatever it may be, of the work and of the powers of the author? ...|$|E
5000|$|Although largely collaged from easy {{listening}} records Stapleton {{acquired in}} the late-1970s and early-1980s, the album boasted a large cast list of over 40 people. John Balance {{is one of those}} who is credited but he did not actually contribute. As Stapleton explained to Keenan [...] "I'd just finished this album with about 40 people on it. He said [...] "Can I be on it?". I said, [...] "It's finished". He said, [...] "I know but <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> credit anyway?", I said [...] "Alright then" [...] That was my first meeting with Balance".|$|E
5000|$|The close {{friendship}} between Angelo Pescarini and Fichera has not his roots in their scientific interests: {{it is another}} war story. As [...] recalls, Gaetano, being escaped from Verona and hidden in a convent in Alfonsine, tried {{to get in touch}} with the local group of partisans in order to help the people of that town who had been so helpful with him: they were informed about an assistant professor to the chair of higher analysis in Rome who was trying to reach them. Angelo, which was a student of mathematics at the University of Bologna under Gianfranco Cimmino, a former pupil of Mauro Picone, was charged of the task of testing the truth of Gaetano's assertions, examining him in mathematics: his question was:- [...] "Mi sai dire una condizione sufficiente per scambiare un limite con un integrale (<b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> sufficient condition for interchanging limit and integration)?"-. Gaetano quickly answered:- [...] "Non solo ti darò la condizione sufficiente, ma ti darò anche la condizione necessaria e pure per insiemi non limitati (I can give you not only a sufficient condition, but also a necessary condition, and not only for bounded domains, but also for unbounded domains)"-. In effect, Fichera proved such a theorem in the paper , his latest paper written in while he was in Rome before joining the army: from that moment on he often used to joke saying that good mathematicians can always have a good application, even for saving one's life.|$|E
5000|$|Amy Acker had {{to dress}} as a Lornette for {{the scene in}} which she helps Lorne escape; Hallett says Acker kept joking, [...] "Andy, I have to overact and act bad - <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> any tips?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saved you--I nurtured you--I loved you. You forsook me--you robbed me--you denied <b>me.</b> What <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me?</b> <b>You</b> {{have made}} the world {{bitterness}} to me; {{but there is one}} draught of sweetness left--that you shall know agony." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{very little}} information, which I trust {{it will not}} trouble <b>you</b> to <b>give</b> <b>me.</b> My men have just {{discovered}} the uniform belonging to a deserter from the Fort lying in the bushes yonder. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> the slightest idea how it came there?" ...|$|R
