5|$|Sitting Bull and {{his band}} of 186 people were kept {{separate}} from the other Hunkpapa gathered at the agency. Army officials were <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would stir up trouble among the recently surrendered northern bands. On August 26, 1881, he was visited by census taker William T. Selwyn, who counted twelve people in the Hunkpapa leader's immediate family. Forty-one families, totaling 195 people, were recorded in Sitting Bull's band.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to bribe his way free of his guards, Rupert was imprisoned in Linz. Lord Craven, also taken in the battle, {{attempted}} to persuade his captors {{to allow him to}} remain with Rupert, but was refused. Rupert's imprisonment was surrounded by religious overtones. His mother was deeply <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might be converted from Calvinism to Catholicism; his captors, encouraged by Emperor Ferdinand III, deployed Jesuit priests in an attempt to convert him. The Emperor went further, proffering the option of freedom, a position as an Imperial general and a small principality if Rupert would convert. Rupert refused.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{served as}} a Ruling Elder at the Presbyterian General Assembly of 1832, then {{relocated}} to Princeton, New Jersey, to study under Samuel Miller at Princeton Theological Seminary. In November 1832, he succeeded his brother John as pastor of Second Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, Maryland. His tenure saw numerous converts, but he was put at odds with his brother and Samuel Miller over practices employed in his church. His counselors were also <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was wavering on {{his belief in the}} doctrine of limited atonement. Eventually, he was persuaded back into the doctrines of the orthodox Calvinism and became {{one of the leaders of}} the Old School Presbyterian movement.|$|E

5|$|In July 1952, Kesselring was {{diagnosed}} with a cancerous growth in the throat. During World War I, he had frequently smoked up to twenty cigars per day but he quit smoking in 1925. Although the British were suspicious of the diagnosis, they were <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might die in prison like Mälzer, which would be a public relations disaster. Kesselring was transferred to a hospital, under guard. In October 1952, Kesselring was released from his prison sentence on the grounds of ill-health.|$|E
5|$|After hearing {{news that}} Syed {{is trying to}} find his wife Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas), Yusef visits her father, Qadim (Ramon Tikaram) at his office and offers to avenge his family for causing Amira pain. When Zainab and Yusef attend an event together, people assume they are married and Zainab does not correct them. Afterwards, Yusef admits to Zainab that he has great {{feelings}} for her but they should maintain some distance as she is married. Yusef continues to manipulate Zainab and ply her with pills, but she says she wishes to stop taking them, so Yusef crushes up a bottle of pills and conceals them in Zainab's food. Zainab passes out and is hospitalised, with her family believing she took a deliberate overdose, as was Yusef's plan. <b>Concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> himself is causing Zainab's worries, Masood divorces Zainab by saying the triple talaq.|$|E
5|$|Building for the 1975–76 {{campaign}} {{he signed}} Phil Boersma from Liverpool to replace Murdoch, but Boersma never settled {{at the club}} and was frequently injured. They finished in 13th place, {{and went on to}} win the Anglo-Scottish Cup with a 1–0 win over Fulham. They also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup, and took a 1–0 lead over Manchester City into the second leg at Maine Road, where they were soundly beaten 4–0. However teams had begun to learn how to combat Charlton's attack strategy and left their centre-backs on the outside of the penalty box to neutralise the threat of Foggon. Despite the team's steady progress the club's board voted to sack Charlton in July 1976 after becoming increasingly <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was overstepping his authority in negotiating business deals on behalf of the club and choosing the club's strip. However, the club chairman overruled the decision and Charlton remained in charge.|$|E

5|$|Having {{attended}} the National Defence College, Jackson joined the directing {{staff at the}} Army Staff College and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1981. He served {{as a member of}} the directing staff at the Staff College, Camberley, for two and a half years. During his tenure at Camberley, he was seconded to a staff position at the Ministry of Defence in 1982 during the Falklands War, and thus missed the opportunity to serve in the conflict directly. He took command of 1 PARA in March 1984, who, at the time, were deployed in Norway, training for the possibility of a Soviet attack. <b>Concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was insufficiently prepared for the weather conditions, he left Camberley early to train with the Royal Marines. He was appointed Senior Directing Staff (Army) at the Joint Service Defence College from 1986 to 1988 and was promoted to colonel in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Alex Tew, {{a student}} from Cricklade in Wiltshire, England, {{conceived}} The Million Dollar Homepage in August 2005 when he was 21 years old. He {{was about to begin}} a three-year Business Management course at the University of Nottingham, and was <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be left with a student loan that could take years to repay. As a money-raising idea, Tew decided to sell a million pixels on a website for $1 each; purchasers would add their own image, logo or advertisement, and have the option of including a hyperlink to their website. Pixels were sold for US dollars rather than UK pounds; the US has a larger online population than the UK, and Tew believed more people would relate to the concept if the pixels were sold in US currency. In 2005, the pound was strong against the dollar: £1 was worth approximately $1.80, and that cost per pixel may have been too expensive for many potential buyers. Tew's setup costs were €50, which paid for the registration of the domain name and a basic web-hosting package. The website went live on 26 August 2005.|$|E
25|$|On August 23, 1999, a 20-year-old Long Island man {{fell from}} his safety {{restraints}} to his death. An investigation discovered the restraints were working properly and still secured {{when the train}} returned to the station. Less than a month later, a 13-year-old boy, <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not properly restrained, intentionally slipped out of them as the train ascended the lift hill and jumped onto the adjacent maintenance catwalk.|$|E

25|$|He was {{convinced}} {{of the need to}} make an immediate transition of power after the assassination to provide stability to a grieving nation in shock. He and the Secret Service were <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could also be a target of a conspiracy, and felt compelled to rapidly remove the new president from Dallas and return him to Washington. This was greeted by some with assertions that Johnson was in too much haste to assume power.|$|E
25|$|<b>Concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{might not}} be able to afford to go to a university, Wilson tried to enlist in the United States Army. He planned to earn U.S. {{government}} financial support for his education, but failed the Army medical examination due to his impaired eyesight. Wilson was able to afford to enroll in the University of Alabama after all, earning his B.S. and M.S. degrees in biology there in 1950. In 1952 he transferred to Harvard University.|$|E
25|$|Around 1807 (sources differ), {{during the}} Napoleonic wars, the French were occupying the German town of Braunschweig, where Gauss lived.

General Pernety sent a chief of a battalion to meet with Gauss personally {{to see that he}} was safe. As it turned out, Gauss was fine, but he was confused by the mention of Sophie's name.|$|E

25|$|The {{distinction}} of Samuel's translation is its accuracy and faithfulness to the original. Some critics have been <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> introduced {{a number of}} Arabic words into Hebrew, and, by analogy with the Arabic, he gives to certain Hebrew words meanings different from the accepted ones. But generally the scope and success of his work are not questioned. Especially admirable is the skill with which he reproduces in Hebrew the abstract ideas of Maimonides, as Hebrew is essentially a language of a people expressing concrete ideas.|$|E
25|$|The producer's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Prem Kumar was Shahrukh Khan, an {{established}} Bollywood star and host of the 2007 series of Kaun Banega Crorepati (the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?). However Khan turned down the role, <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not want to give his audience the impression that the real show was a fraud by playing a fraud host in the movie. Despite the subsequent success of the film, Khan has stated that he does not regret turning the role down and has been a vociferous supporter of the film to its critics.|$|E
25|$|Roddam and his {{men were}} taken to Hispaniola and imprisoned there. At first Roddam was allowed to visit his men everyday, but after some time, this was refused. His men became <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been murdered, and on not getting a {{satisfactory}} answer to their queries, seized their guards and took up arms. The prison governor sent for Roddam {{and asked him to}} restore order among his men, which Roddam only agreed to do once he had received promises of better treatment for them. Their treatment improved, and after two months in prison the men were paroled back to Jamaica.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} war, Léopold III, who had {{surrendered}} {{himself to the}} German army in 1940, was released; however, {{the issue of whether}} he had betrayed his country by surrendering, while most government ministers had escaped to the United Kingdom, presented an important constitutional dilemma. In particular, the Belgian public was <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might be a collaborator with the Nazis. He had met Hitler in Berchtesgaden on November 19, 1940 and had even remarried (to Lilian Baels) during the war. Many Belgians, especially the Socialists, strongly opposed his return to power. He was kept in exile in Switzerland until 1950, while his brother Prince Charles presided as regent.|$|E
25|$|Instead, Chávez {{would be}} taken to La Orchila, a {{military}} base {{off the coast of}} Venezuela, until rebel leaders could decide Chávez's fate. Whilst being held at Fort Tiuna, Chávez had access to television and saw the rolling television claims of his resignation, and became <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be killed (and the death made to look like suicide) {{in order to keep the}} narrative clear. He was able to get word out that he had not in fact resigned, via a telephone call to his daughter, who, via switchboard operators at Miraflores still loyal to Chávez, was able to speak first to Fidel Castro and then to Cuban television.|$|E
25|$|In March 1974, Harold Wilson invited Heffer to be Minister of State at the Department of Industry under Tony Benn. Heffer {{accepted}} the offer, while remaining <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be cocooned {{in his office}} and lose his links with the wider Labour movement outside. He had some difficulties coping with the concept of 'collective responsibility' - denouncing the government's decision to continue a contract to build warships with the right-wing government of Chile on 10 April. Wilson, reluctant to cause trouble with the left-wing, decided not to sack him on the grounds that he was inexperienced. Heffer received many minutes from Wilson asking him to follow government policy in speeches, such that he minuted Wilson to tell him not to send them.|$|E
