5|$|H. G. Wells <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term The Land Ironclads in a {{short story}} {{published}} in 1903, to describe fictional large armored fighting vehicles moving on Pedrail wheels.|$|E
5|$|Henry Piddington {{published}} almost 40 papers {{dealing with}} tropical storms from Calcutta between 1835 and 1855 in The Journal of the Asiatic Society. He also <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term cyclone, meaning the coil of a snake. In 1842, he published his landmark thesis, Laws of the Storms.|$|E
5|$|Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> {{binomial}} Dromaiusater in 1817. In 1906, Walter Baldwin Spencer <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> name Dromaiusminor {{based on}} some Pleistocene subfossil bones and eggshells found on King Island the same year, believing {{they were the first}} physical evidence of an emu from there. William Vincent Legge also coined a name for these remains, Dromaiusbassi, but at a later date. In his 1907 book Extinct Birds, Walter Rothschild stated that Vieillot's description actually referred to the mainland emu, and that the name D.ater was therefore invalid. Believing the skin in Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle of Paris was from Kangaroo Island, he made it the type specimen of his new species Dromaiusperoni, named after the French naturalist François Péron, who is the main source of information about the bird in life.|$|E
5000|$|Louis d'or (gold coin) = 24 livres, {{along with}} a half-Louis <b>coin</b> (<b>the</b> demi-louis d'or) and a two-Louis <b>coin</b> (<b>the</b> double louis d'or) (12 and 48 livres).|$|R
25|$|In {{an effort}} to curb counterfeiting, a new 5-rand coin was {{released}} in August 2004. Security features introduced on <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> include a bimetal design (similar to the €1 and €2 <b>coins,</b> <b>the</b> Thai 10-baht <b>coin,</b> <b>the</b> British £2 <b>coin,</b> and <b>the</b> Canadian $2 <b>coin),</b> a specially serrated security groove along the rim and microlettering.|$|R
50|$|To {{commemorate the}} 25th anniversary of <b>the</b> kookaburra <b>coin,</b> <b>the</b> 2015 <b>coin</b> {{features}} <b>the</b> same {{image of the}} kookaburra as <b>the</b> original 1990 <b>coin.</b> To differentiate <b>the</b> 1990 and 2015 <b>coins</b> <b>the</b> date on the reverse reads 1990-2015 and 2015 {{has been added to}} the obverse. <b>The</b> 2015 <b>coin</b> had a release date of September 1, 2014.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the mutiny, the {{division}} was moved to the Neuhammer training grounds in the Silesian region of Germany (present-day Poland) to complete its training. During the training phase, the German officers, pleased with its progress, <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term Mujo for the Bosnian Muslims. The members of the division swore an oath of allegiance to both Hitler and Pavelić.|$|E
5|$|By 2009 {{some of the}} {{conditions}} required for a currency war had returned, with a severe economic downturn seeing global trade in that year decline by about 12%. There was a widespread concern among advanced economies {{about the size of}} their deficits; they increasingly joined emerging economies in viewing export led growth as their ideal strategy. In March 2009, even before international co-operation reached its peak with the 2009 G-20 London Summit , economist Ted Truman {{became one of the first}} to warn of the dangers of competitive devaluation. He also <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> phrase competitive non-appreciation.|$|E
5|$|Campbell {{attended}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), {{where he was}} befriended by the eminent mathematician Norbert Wiener (who <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term cybernetics). He began writing science fiction at age 18 and sold his first stories quickly. From January 1930 to June 1931, Amazing published six of his short stories, one novel, and six letters. Thus he was a well-known pulp writer at 21 – but he had failed German and MIT had dismissed him. After one year at Duke University, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in physics in 1932.|$|E

50|$|Another version {{includes}} spinning a coin {{on a flat}} surface, then grabbing it {{with the}} pad of the players thumb with the thumbs crossed like an x. If the player grabs <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> between <b>the</b> thumbs they rotate spinning until one does not grab <b>the</b> <b>coin.</b> When <b>the</b> player does not grab <b>the</b> <b>coin,</b> <b>the</b> opponent forcefully slides <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> into <b>the</b> losers knuckles with the knuckles flat on the surface with one arm behind if they miss the knuckles. Whoever bleeds any amount first loses.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> 50 mil <b>coin</b> {{became known}} as a '{{shilling}}', {{because it was the}} same size as the 1 shilling and 9 piastre <b>coins.</b> <b>The</b> 100 mil <b>coin</b> {{became known as}} '2 shillings', because it was {{the same size as the}} 2 shilling and 18 piastre <b>coins.</b> <b>The</b> 5 mil <b>coin</b> and 100 mil coin of 1956 are very sought after by collectors of Commonwealth <b>coins.</b> <b>The</b> 100 mils is very rare.|$|R
5|$|French naturalists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard {{originally}} {{described the}} cookiecutter shark during the 18171820 exploratory voyage of the corvette Uranie under Louis de Freycinet, {{giving it the}} name Scymnus brasiliensis because the type specimen was caught off Brazil. In 1824, their account was published as part of Voyage autour du monde...sur les corvettes de S.M. l'Uranie et la Physicienne, Louis de Freycinet's 13 volume report on the voyage. In 1865, American ichthyologist Theodore Nicholas Gill <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> new genus Isistius for this species, after Isis, the Egyptian goddess of light.|$|E
5|$|Gomphus clavatus is {{commonly}} known as pig's ears, alluding to the violet underside and yellowish cap of the fruit bodies, although this vernacular name is also used for Discina perlata. Other English common names for this species include clustered chanterelle and violet chanterelle. Gray <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> name clubbed gomphe. In the Sherpa language of Nepal the fungus is known as Eeshyamo ("mother-in-law"), as its imposing fruit body is reminiscent of a mother-in-law, who has a dominant role in the Sherpa family.|$|E
5|$|Gould was a {{champion}} of biological constraints, internal limitations upon developmental pathways, {{as well as other}} non-selectionist forces in evolution. Rather than direct adaptations, he considered many higher functions of the human brain to be the unintended side consequence of natural selection. To describe such co-opted features, he <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term exaptation with paleontologist Elisabeth Vrba. Gould believed this feature of human mentality undermines an essential premise of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>coin</b> shares, with <b>the</b> 50 yen <b>coin,</b> <b>the</b> emperor's rule date (28 in 2016) {{expressed}} with Latin numerals {{instead of}} in Japanese numerals.|$|R
5000|$|The new 50 qəpik <b>coin</b> of <b>the</b> Azerbaijani manat {{also looks}} like a €2 <b>coin.</b> <b>The</b> new <b>coin</b> set of <b>the</b> country {{contains}} other coins similar to some euro coins.|$|R
25|$|Nazi Germany had {{a number}} of mints. Each mint {{location}} had its own identifiable letter. It is therefore possible to identify exactly which mint produced what <b>coin</b> by noting <b>the</b> mint mark on <b>the</b> <b>coin.</b> Not all mints were authorized to produce <b>coins</b> every year. <b>The</b> mints were also only authorized to produce a set number of coins with some mints allocated a greater production than others. Some of <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> with particular mint marks are therefore scarcer than others. With the silver 2 and 5 Reichsmark <b>coins,</b> <b>the</b> mint mark is found under the date {{on the left side of}} <b>the</b> <b>coin.</b> On <b>the</b> smaller denomination Reichspfennig <b>coins,</b> <b>the</b> mint mark is found on the bottom center of <b>the</b> <b>coin.</b>|$|R
5|$|New Scientist <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term {{nominative}} contradeterminism {{for people}} who move away from their name, creating a contradiction between name and occupation. Examples include Portland Chief of Police Danielle Outlaw, Andrew Waterhouse, a professor of wine, would-be doctor Thomas Edward Kill, who subsequently {{changed his name to}} Jirgensohn, and the Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Sin. The synonym inaptronym is also sometimes used.|$|E
5|$|Nhất Hạnh {{has also}} been a leader in the Engaged Buddhism {{movement}} (he <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term), promoting the individual's active role in creating change. He cites the 13th-century Vietnamese king Trần Nhân Tông with the origination of the concept. Trần Nhân Tông abdicated his throne to become a monk and founded the Vietnamese Buddhist school of the Bamboo Forest tradition.|$|E
5|$|Numerous authors {{described}} cretinism, myxoedema {{their relationship}} with the thyroid in the nineteenth century. Charles Mayo <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term hyperthyroidism in 1910, Hakaru Hashimoto documented a case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in 1912, and autoantibodies were demonstrated in 1956. Knowledge of the thyroid and its conditions developed throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with many modern treatments and investigative modalities evolving throughout the mid twentieth century, including the use of radioactive iodine, thiouracil and fine needle aspiration.|$|E
50|$|Maltese euro <b>coins</b> feature <b>the</b> Maltese {{cross on}} €2 and €1 <b>coins,</b> <b>the</b> {{coat of arms}} of Malta on the €0.50, €0.20 and €0.10 <b>coins,</b> and <b>the</b> Mnajdra Temples on the €0.05, €0.02 and €0.01 coins.|$|R
50|$|The 50th {{anniversary of}} Bannister's {{achievement}} {{was marked by}} a commemorative British 50-pence <b>coin.</b> <b>The</b> reverse of <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> shows <b>the</b> legs of a runner and a stopwatch (stopped at 3:59.4).|$|R
25|$|The {{important}} aspects are the tumbling motion of <b>the</b> <b>coin,</b> <b>the</b> precession (wobbling) of its axis, and whether <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> bounces at <b>the</b> {{end of its}} trajectory.|$|R
5|$|Paleontologists Jose Bonaparte and Fernando Novas <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> name Abelisauridae in 1985 {{when they}} {{described}} the eponymous Abelisaurus. The name is formed {{from the family}} name of Roberto Abel, who discovered Abelisaurus, {{as well as from}} the Greek word σαυρος/sauros meaning 'lizard'. The very common suffix -idae is usually applied to zoological family names and is derived from the Greek suffix -ιδαι/-idai, which indicates a plural noun.|$|E
5|$|Rosenthal is {{referred}} to as the pioneer of research into seasonal affective disorder. In 1984, he <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term and began studying the use of light therapy as a treatment. Rosenthal's interest in studying the effects of the seasons on mood changes emerged when he emigrated from the mild climate of Johannesburg, South Africa, to the northeastern US. As a resident in the psychiatry program at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, he noticed that he was more energetic and productive during the long days of summer versus the shorter darker days of the winter.|$|E
5|$|Several {{improvements}} {{were made}} to image filters and their theory of operation by Otto Zobel. Zobel <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term constant k filter (or k-type filter) to distinguish Campbell's filter from later types, notably Zobel's m-derived filter (or m-type filter). The particular problems Zobel was trying to address with these new forms were impedance matching into the end terminations and improved steepness of roll-off. These were achieved {{at the cost of}} an increase in filter circuit complexity.|$|E
25|$|To {{meet the}} {{engineering}} and design challenges involved in producing this <b>coin,</b> <b>the</b> Mint perfected a high-speed colouring {{process that can}} generate thirty million <b>coins.</b> <b>The</b> process ensures that the colour adheres to the medal and resists day-to-day wear.|$|R

50|$|Mercanti has {{produced}} more coin and medal designs than any employee in United States Mint history (more than 100 as of 2006). Among {{these are the}} 1984 Olympic gold ten-dollar <b>coin,</b> <b>the</b> 1986 Statue of Liberty dollar <b>coin,</b> <b>the</b> 1989 Congress Bicentennial gold five-dollar <b>coin,</b> <b>the</b> obverse of the 1990 Eisenhower Centennial silver dollar, the obverse of the 1991 Mount Rushmore five-dollar <b>coin,</b> <b>the</b> obverse of the 1991 Korean War Memorial silver dollar, and the obverse of the 2005 John Marshall commemorative dollar. In addition to designing and sculpting a number of Congressional Gold Medals, Mercanti worked on quarters for the states of Arkansas, Iowa, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia for the 50 State Quarters Program.|$|R
5|$|The higher-level {{classification}} of millipedes is presented below, based on Shear, 2011, and Shear & Edgecombe, 2010 (extinct groups). Recent cladistic and molecular studies have challenged the traditional classification schemes above, {{and in particular}} the position of the orders Siphoniulida and Polyzoniida is not yet well established. The placement and positions of extinct groups (†) known only from fossils is tentative and not fully resolved. After each name is listed the author citation: the name of the person who <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> name or defined the group, even if not at the current rank.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which {{began to be}} exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence {{on the development of}} modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism. Famous ukiyo-e artists include Hokusai and Hiroshige. Hokusai <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term manga. Japanese comics now known as manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide. Japanese animation is called anime. Japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{new wave}} of British heavy metal (commonly {{abbreviated}} as NWOBHM) was a nationwide musical movement that started in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. Journalist Geoff Barton <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper Sounds to describe {{the emergence of new}} heavy metal bands in the late 1970s, during the period of punk rock's decline and the dominance of new wave music.|$|E
50|$|They {{are known}} {{from some of}} their <b>coins.</b> <b>The</b> silver <b>coins</b> of <b>the</b> Kunindas, the Vemakas and the Audumbaras closely follow <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> of Indo-Greek king Apollodotus II in their {{characteristics}} (weight, size and material).|$|R
40|$|A coin is {{balanced}} on the flat end of a bent coat hanger. With practice, the coat hanger can be rotated in a complete circle without displacing <b>the</b> <b>coin,</b> as shown in Figure 1, which is taken from the video. This is demonstrated in real time and in slow motion. This demonstration makes use of the contact force between <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> and <b>the</b> end of the coat hanger to hold <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> in place. <b>The</b> centripetal force exerted by the coat hanger on <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> and <b>the</b> resultant centrifugal reaction exerted on the coat hanger by <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> provide <b>the</b> contact force...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} who also credit him for <b>coining</b> <b>the</b> term 'urban Gujarati film'. However, the term he used for 'Better Half' 'a simple Gujarati film'. He returns the credit to media for <b>coining</b> <b>the</b> phrase, {{which has become a}} {{prevailing}} phenomenon.|$|R
