It is found that at the present age of solar evolution, the models employed have internal rotation rates significantly larger than those allowed by measured solar oblateness, suggesting that the effects of <b>circulation</b> <b>currents</b> near the outer boundary of the radiative interior have been underestimated.

30|$|There are {{available}} literatures and referenced results about the inhibition technology of harmonic <b>circulation</b> <b>current</b> in parallel inverter driving system. The direct current (DC) component {{generated in the}} inverter parallel system makes the output filter inductor of inverter be saturation, uneven thermal and electrical stress of each electrical module, which reduce {{the reliability of the}} inverter parallel driving system (Chen et al. 2003). In order to inhibit the DC circulating current, there are some developed methods such as voltage and current double close-loop control, three-state hysteresis control, filter circuit elimination and regulation of the reference sine wave DC component (Chen et al. 2004; He and Xu 2012; He and Zhang 2008). Zhang et al. analyzed the case of two inverters sharing a rectifier module, which will produce a zero sequence <b>circulation</b> <b>current</b> through the DC bus and consume a lot of energy, reduce the efficiency of the system and cause saturation of filter reactor (2006 a). Therefore, inverter units in parallel were suggested to adopt a separate rectifier modules. Zhang et al. (2006 b) and Liu et al. (2011) analyzed the presence of harmonic circulating current caused by dead zone dispersion of switch, delay of driving circuit and over modulation, of which the dead zone of switch is the most influenced component. In recent years, some inhibition technologies of harmonic <b>circulation</b> <b>current</b> are proposed, including control method of the instantaneous voltage feedback, repetitive control method and dual-loop control method of voltage and current (Ogasawara et al. 1992; Kawakami et al. 1994).|$|E
