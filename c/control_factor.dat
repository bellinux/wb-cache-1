He made three films in Spain with director José Antonio Nieves Conde, including Marta in 1970, The Great Swindle in 1971, and Casa Manchada in 1975.

He also made several Westerns, including Hannie Caulder with Raquel Welch in 1971, The Man Called Noon in 1973, Those Dirty Dogs in 1973 and Potato Fritz in 1976.

5000|$|FPP is an {{important}} metabolic intermediate in the mevalonate pathway that represents a major branch point in terpenoid pathways. [...] FPP is used to form several important classes of compounds in addition to sterols (via squalene), including ubiquinone and dolichols. [...] SQS catalyzes the first committed step in sterol biosynthesis from FPP, and is therefore important for controlling the flux towards sterol vs. non-sterol products. The activity of SQS is intimately related to the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway. High levels of LDL-derived cholesterol inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity significantly, since mevalonate is no longer needed for sterol production. However, residual HMG-CoA reductase activity is observed even with very high LDL levels, such that FPP {{can be made for}} forming non-sterol products essential for cell growth. [...] To prevent this residual FPP from being used for sterol synthesis when sterols are abundant, SQS activity declines significantly when LDL levels are high. [...] This suppression of SQS activity is better thought of as a flux control mechanism, rather than a way to regulate cholesterol levels. This is since HMG-CoA reductase is the more significant <b>control</b> <b>factor</b> for regulating cholesterol synthesis (its activity is 98% inhibited when LDL levels are high).|$|E
40|$|Within many {{ecological}} systems, {{relationships between}} <b>controlling</b> <b>factors</b> and associated response variables are complex. In many cases, the response should vary little when the <b>controlling</b> <b>factor</b> exerts strong effects. Conversely, when {{the effect of}} the <b>controlling</b> <b>factor</b> is weak or absent, the response may vary greatly with effects of other factors. Correlation or regression analyses often may not be appropriate for testing these relationships, because variance of the response changes with values of the <b>controlling</b> <b>factor.</b> We suggest using a technique from the astronomy literature, a two-dimensional Kolmogorov- Smirnov (2 DKS) test, to detect relationships in bivariate data with these patterns of variance. This technique successfully identified simulated bivariate data composed of paired independent values as having nonsignificant relationships and simulated bivariate data in which mean and variance of y was constrained at high levels of x as having significant relationships. Using these simulations and examples from aquatic and terrestrial systems, we demonstrate that the 2 DKS is a robust test for detecting nonrandom patterns in bivariate distributions that commonly arise in many ecological systems...|$|R
