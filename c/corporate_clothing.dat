40|$|Objective of {{the study}} This study aimed to analyze how fashion stores {{communicate}} the corporate identity through window displays. The window display is {{a crucial part of}} visual merchandising, which remains an important channel of corporate marketing communication. However, little attention so far has been paid to how the window display works as a channel for companies to communicate corporate identity. This research tried to fill the gap by studying the window displays of fashion stores. Methodology and the Analytical framework The study adopted the semiotic approach to analyze the window displays of ten fashion stores located in Helsinki. From the semiotic perspective, the window display can be regarded as a semiotic resource as well as a sign system containing multiple visual messages. In addition, this research utilized an analytical framework adapted from Kress and van Leeuwen's (2006) three-metafunction framework of visual communication to analyze the window displays of the ten fashion stores. Findings and Conclusion Based on the analytical framework, the findings were elaborated according to the three metafunctions namely the ideational metafunction, the interpersonal metafunction, and the textual metafunction of the window displays. The results demonstrated that the fashion stores have integrated multiple signs and elements in their window displays to communicate <b>corporate</b> identity: 1) <b>Clothing</b> communication is the most salient and efficient in representing and communicating corporate identity; 2) Images and background are utilized as enhancement; 3) The less salient elements are used to support the communication of corporate identity. However, window displays have limitations in communicating corporate identity too. In some window displays, part of the corporate identity is missing, and the visual presentations are not recognizable...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (BTech (Fashion Design)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2010 A {{research}} was conducted in order to assist the Young Fuller Figured Women entering and already working in the <b>corporate</b> environment with <b>clothing</b> for the work environment. This {{research was}} conducted so that these women may notice {{a smaller number of}} incorrect fitting clothes when they shop for formal wear and also to give them guidance on suitable, elegant and stylish clothes for their body size and shape. Two theories namely: 'dress for success' by John Molloy and 'clothing is a code' by Fred Davis were the guidelines jn discovering, understanding and solving the dress problem for the young full figured women. In order {{to deal with the problem}} I had to interview some of these women to understand their challenges and frustration regarding dressing suitably for the corporate environment. The results of the interviews showed that the origin of the problem, are the basic block pattems. This was the solution for most of the garment fitting problems that the young fuller figured women experienced daily. A range was designed to serve as an example of how these women can dress for the corporate environment using various suitable fabrics and colours. This range appears formal and yet has a feminine twist to it, making it suitable for the woman who wants to be taken seriously and yet maintain her femininity and elegance. I hope that this research will be a useful tool for the retailers who currently cater for the fuller fIgured women to assist them with the current garment fitting problems and for the designers who plan to enter the fuller figured market: to enter it cautiously and taking the requirements of their potential customers into consideration If the information in this research is applied clothes that the fuller figured women buy will fit correctly the first time and they will not have to pay extra to alter new garments...|$|R

50|$|Workers {{sometimes}} wear uniforms or <b>corporate</b> <b>clothing</b> of one {{nature or}} another. Workers required {{to wear a}} uniform include retail workers, bank and post office workers, public security and health care workers, blue collar employees, personal trainers in health clubs, instructors in summer camps, lifeguards, janitors, public transit employees, towing and truck drivers, airline employees and holiday operators, and bar, restaurant and hotel employees. The use of uniforms by these organizations is often an effort in branding and developing a standard corporate image but also has important effects on the employees required to wear the uniform. The term uniform may be misleading because employees are not always fully uniform in appearance and may not always wear attire provided by the organization, while still representing the organization in their attire. Academic work on organizational dress by Rafaeli & Pratt (1993) referred to uniformity (homogeneity) of dress as one dimension, and conspicuousness as a second. Employees all wearing black, for example, may appear conspicuous and thus represent the organization even though their attire is uniform only in {{the color of their}} appearance, not in its features. Pratt & Rafaeli, (1997) described struggles between employees and management about organizational dress as struggles about deeper meanings and identities that dress represents. And Pratt & Rafaeli (2001) described dress as one of the larger set of symbols and artifacts in organizations which coalesce into a communication grammar.|$|E
40|$|This report {{considers}} {{product labelling}} to improve end-of-life (EoL) management of <b>corporate</b> <b>clothing,</b> {{taking into account}} the process of development, provision, retrieval and disposal. It is based on a study which was mainly desk research but, in order to gain accurate perspectives of each stage, face to face interviews were conducted to gain opinions from best practice stakeholders across the lifecycle. These included suppliers (companies that offer / create <b>corporate</b> <b>clothing</b> garments), providers (organisations that require staff members to wear clothing/uniform that presents a corporate image) and clothing recycler / re processors. A review of policy documents, information on labelling, reports and web based material has revealed issues that are likely to influence the position and future practice of suppliers and providers of <b>corporate</b> <b>clothing.</b> We present, first, an overview of the role of eco-labelling within the contexts of government policy, financial revenue and market opportunities. This is followed by a brief explanation of the categorisation of the eco-labelling systems as they occur in the textiles industry. Tables in the Appendix present all the textiles eco-labels that were found through the research and those eco-labels that stipulate EoL management as part of their criteria for award are further examined. A major issue regarding eco-labelling is the cost, and this is considered with regard to manufacturers and buyers of corporatewear. The report ends by considering the issues for all the stakeholders and conducts a stakeholder analysis. The report concludes with following recommendations: •	To <b>corporate</b> <b>clothing</b> providers: to capture a market opportunity and use eco-labels to promote their eco-credentials and to devise more efficient methods of recovering corporatewear to put into the reuse/recycle/ remanufacture routes. •	To raw material and corporatewear clothing manufacturers: source and use materials that are eco-labelled. •	To government (as providers of uniforms / work wear) : to lead by example and encourage local authorities to use products with recognisable reuse/recyclable properties such as janitorial products (e. g. wipers) •	To government (in their role as policy makers) : to recommend and stipulate a preference for eco-labelled corporatewear/fabrics wherever possible, in green public procurement policies and consider abolishing the tax tab, replacing with eco-label and stipulate that a proportion of any uniforms/clothing provided have the capacity to be re-worn (standard items that are not heavily branded), or reused (encourage the use of preferred pure blend fabrics). •	To corporatewear wearers: to be encouraged to return corporatewear to firms when they no longer use to ensure that it is placed into the companies’ EoL management systems for corporatewear – companies or government may consider some form of tax or levy until the uniform is returned. •	To textile recyclers: to encourage developing relationships with companies that provide corporatewear, and with corporatewear manufacturers to ensure that EoL management issues are considered throughout the product development and use phases of the lifecycle of the corporatewear...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Mass Customisation (MC) is {{increasingly}} being touted {{in the global}} clothing industry as a key strategy to survive an ever-more turbulent market. A European Union report (Probst, Monfardini, Frideres, Demetri, Kauffmann & Clarke, 2013) estimates that five per cent of the global fashion industry will be mass customised by 2018. This growing importance necessitates its consideration in the South African context, especially as a possible opportunity for the ailing clothing manufacturing sector. Since there is a dearth of literature on MC in the South African context, an exploration into the suitability of MC as a manufacturing strategy for South African clothing manufacturers was {{a first step in}} understanding this opportunity. The competencies needed to successfully undertake MC manufacturing were drawn from the literature and were used to frame the research. Three <b>corporate</b> <b>clothing</b> manufacturers were selected as a case for this study due to the existing levels of customisation that exist in this sector. In-depth interviews were conducted in order to determine whether these firms currently exhibited the existence of the identified competencies essential to undertake MC within their organisations. One of the interviewed manufacturers seemed to have all the competencies needed to manufacture for mass customisation, whilst another very-almost did. All three manufacturers were severely affected by the dearth of suppliers and this led to the competencies identified from the literature being revised for the South African context. M. Com.

40|$|This is a {{case study}} that investigates a {{supplier}} selection process at a South African clothing manufacturing company, hereafter referred to as Brand Solutions. Brand Solutions is a supplier {{of a wide range}} of custom-made <b>corporate</b> <b>clothing,</b> headwear, promotional clothing, bags and luggage. The company has in-house knitting mill that makes fabric using mercerised, bamboo, polyester and 100 % cotton yarn that is sourced locally and abroad. Brand Solutions also does branding through digital transfer printing, embroidery, digital ultra violet light printing, silkscreen printing and laser engraving. Data for this study was collected by a University of Johannesburg Industrial Engineering Student. The student had interviews with the procurement, production and quality assurance managers. She verified the answers given by the interviewees by taking informative tours of the production floor, warehouse and management offices of the plant. A review of company documents and relevant literature from journals was also done. The research revealed that on new suppliers, Brand Solutions selects them based on the quality, material shrinkage, colour fastness, grammage, cost, delivery lead time, and product mix flexibility. Once the suppliers pass this test, their performance is not reviewed again. These findings have implications on the performance and competitiveness of Brand Solutions. Moreover the findings have a bearing on Brand Solutions’ growth in employment, market share and revenue. Lastly, the study contributes by suggesting the supplier selection model that a clothing manufacturing entity should adopt in relation to the environment that it operates in...|$|E
40|$|Uniforms can be {{regarded}} as a group emblem, a certificate of legitimacy, and a suppressor of individuality. Uniforms therefore can reveal the status of the wearer, enhance the identity of the employees and facilitate group cohesion. Nowadays, many large international organisations, such as airlines, have developed <b>corporate</b> <b>clothing</b> (or uniforms) to enhance their corporate image. In Hong Kong, the image of taxi services is relatively poor. This may be affected by their poor services provided, their appearance and/or the way they wear. Recently, most of the taxi drivers wear T-shirt, vest, shorts or jeans and some are relatively “scruffy”. In respect to the poor image of Hong Kong taxi drivers, this project therefore initiated the development of uniform for taxi drivers with the aim at giving them a new identity and improving their social status. In this study, the nature of work, working condition, the perception of taxi passengers and drivers towards the images of Hong Kong taxi drivers and wearing uniforms were investigated. Anticipated with the current development of Hong Kong’s tourism, it is generally perceived that not only encouraging a positive and competence image of Hong Kong taxi services, uniforms may also enhance the self-esteem, confidence and working morale of taxi drivers. In this study, four commercial fabrics were selected and fabrics were evaluated in terms of comfortability, durability and appearance retention since they are all regarded as very important parameter for the development of uniforms for taxi drivers. Regarding the design of the uniform, image, fitting, comfort and style were considered. Institute of Textiles and ClothingRefereed conference pape...|$|E
