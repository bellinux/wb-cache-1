The assassination plot was uncovered by federal law enforcement {{as a result of the}} ensuing investigation into activities at Rajneeshpuram. Turner was never physically harmed, and had retired by 1995.|$|E

5|$|In November 2004, Clinton {{announced}} that she would seek a second Senate term. Clinton easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini. The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester <b>County</b> <b>District</b> Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance. Clinton's eventual opponent {{in the general election}} was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67percent of the vote to Spencer's 31percent, carrying all but four of New York's sixty-two counties. Her campaign spent $36 million for her re-election, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008. In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.|$|E
5|$|In early 1979, Des Moines fire {{officials}} {{announced that a}} hydrogen buildup caused by alkaline water leaking from the store's heating and cooling system caused the fire. Court documents filed by prosecuting attorneys in 1981 stated that an electrical malfunction caused wires that were covered in polyvinyl chloride to overheat, giving off hydrochloric acid. Lawyers representing Younkers and {{the families of the}} eleven victims sued more than 20 companies that manufactured or were associated with polyvinyl chloride, including Monsanto Company and Underwriters Laboratories. Most of those lawsuits were settled out of court in 1984, while the last suit against B.F. Goodrich was dismissed by a Polk <b>County</b> <b>district</b> judge in April 1986.|$|E
5|$|It {{appeared}} that Brooks had exhausted all legal avenues at this point, but on June 16, 1873, he filed another lawsuit against Baxter, {{this time with}} the Pulaski <b>County</b> <b>district</b> court. Under Arkansas Civil Code sec. 525, if a person usurps an office or franchise to which he is not entitled, an action at law may be instituted against him either by the State or by the party rightly entitled to the office. On October 8, 1873, Baxter filed a plea of non-jurisdiction, but he believed that the court might decide against him. He issued a telegram to President Grant informing him of the basic situation in Arkansas and asked for federal troops to help him maintain the peace. Grant denied his request.|$|E

5|$|Monroe studied {{surveying}} {{and began}} his career in public service as the county surveyor for Hampshire County. During his tenure, he surveyed {{the majority of the}} county's land tracts. Monroe read law in Romney under prominent local attorney, Alfred P. White. While studying law, he was elected to represent Hampshire County in the Virginia House of Delegates alongside William P. Stump between 1850 and 1851. Monroe {{was a member of the}} Virginia House of Delegates during the 1851 reform of the Constitution of Virginia. In 1857, he was nominated as a Democratic candidate to represent the Hampshire <b>County</b> <b>district</b> in the Senate of Virginia. Monroe was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1858 at the age of 41 and engaged in a law practice in Romney. In 1859, he was elected the Commonwealth's Attorney for Hampshire County.|$|E
5|$|Because he owed few favors to the state's {{established}} politicians, many of Brown's top appointees were businesspeople. Keeping {{a campaign}} promise {{to appoint a}} woman and an African-American to his cabinet, Brown named William E. McAnulty Jr., and Jacqueline Swigart to his cabinet. McAnulty resigned his post {{as secretary of the}} state's Department of Justice within one month, saying the position would keep him from spending enough time with his family. Brown re-appointed McAnulty to his former position as a judge with the Jefferson <b>County</b> <b>District</b> Court and replaced him with another African-American, George W. Wilson. He also appointed Viola Davis Brown as Executive Director of the Office of Public Health Nursing – in 1980, she was the first African-American nurse to lead a state office of public health nursing in the U.S. His most controversial appointment was Frank Metts, his secretary of transportation. Metts broke with political tradition in Kentucky, announcing that contracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive bids and performance rather than political patronage. Despite cutting personnel from the department, Metts doubled the miles of road that were resurfaced.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} days of the shutdown, many {{programs}} requested that their funding continue, especially social service organizations that relied on state funding. To hear their pleas, the courts appointed retired State Supreme Court judge Kathleen Blatz as a special master. Dayton and State Attorney General Lori Swanson also both submitted petitions to the Ramsey <b>County</b> <b>District</b> Court when the shutdown began, asking for the court to clarify whether some programs could continue. Judges Kathleen Gearin and Bruce W. Christopherson issued their rulings on July 7, finding that some programs could start again, including criminal background checks, public schools, and local government aid. Gearin complained that the governor and legislature should have been responsible for making decisions about which services could stay open. Gearin had previously heard a case from the Minnesota Zoo, which asked to remain open despite the shutdown, and another from the Canterbury Park horse racing track in Shakopee. While both pay for themselves at least during the summer, Gearin determined that only the Zoo was allowed to operate without legislative appropriations, so she allowed the Zoo to open on July 2 but ordered Canterbury Park to remain closed the same day.|$|E
