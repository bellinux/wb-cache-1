The reason for my research is that, based {{on the development of}} financial markets in recent years, the interconnection of markets, modern investment instruments and the strengthening of multinational financial groups allow for quick and easy transfer of capital and risk between countries and financial sectors. This forces us to reconsider the appropriateness of the currently used supervisory model. The paper analyzes models of home state supervisor in <b>connection</b> with <b>supervision</b> on a consolidated basis and supervision of financial conglomerates, the model of a lead supervisor and a single supervisor model with the unified structure and dual structure with the Union and national supervisory authorities. As the evaluation criteria were chosen costs for financial institutions, supervisory effectiveness, consumer confidence and political acceptability. The analysis concludes that the most appropriate model of supervision of a single financial market of the European Union is the model of a single supervisory authority with the unified structure. The work is divided into eight chapters to present reasons why the issue should be examined, analyzed [...] ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore how midlevel managers in student affairs learn supervisory skills. Student affairs professionals are given tremendous responsibility for the lives of students outside the classroom. The Association of College Personnel Administrators and other sources outlined the necessary competencies for student affairs professionals to be successful in the field and found supervision to be an important skill for all levels of the profession. Midlevel managers assume many management responsibilities, but there is a dearth of literature surrounding midlevel managers and their responsibilities. This was a basic qualitative study that examined how midlevel managers learned supervisory skills. Midlevel managers reflected on their personal journeys of learning supervisory skills. The sample featured 20 midlevel student affairs professionals from various institutions across the country who were interviewed in the summer of 2009. Transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Analysis revealed that the nature of learning was informal and involved self-directed learning and experiential learning. Next, there was a process of learning supervisory skills, which included (a) entry into the field, (b) realization of becoming a supervisor, (c) seeking resources, and (d) implementation of learning strategies. Contextual factors that influenced the process of learning supervisory skills included barriers and a continuous learning process. The results also illustrated the <b>connection</b> between <b>supervision</b> and professionalism. The dissertation concludes with implications for the field, recommendations focused on the student affairs profession, and suggestions for future research...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addressed the}} teacher supervision process in one independent {{school in the}} United States. It explored teachers’ approaches to giving and receiving feedback, their perceptions of students’ motivation for learning versus their own, and the significance of their professional identities as teachers. ^ The study was motivated by three research questions: (1) What forces shape and mediate independent school teachers’ perceptions of the evaluation process? (2) What do independent school teachers describe as the intersections between student assessment and teacher evaluation? (3) What {{are the implications of}} independent school teachers’ experiences of evaluation for the practice of teacher supervision? The goal was to inform the evolution of more a robust model of independent school teacher supervision and to expand the literature on independent school teaching and learning. The focal population was a group of fifteen Upper School teachers at an independent, co-educational, non-sectarian PK- 12 independent school in a Midwestern city in the United States. The study included individual interviews, focus groups, and document review. ^ What emerged was a recognition that, while parallels exist between the feedback that participants give to students and the feedback they prefer to receive from supervisors, their motivations for professional learning differ significantly from those of their students. Participants’ conceptions of their professional identities, as well as their relationships with administrators and with the institution, yielded useful insights about ways to evolve systems of teacher supervision in independent schools. Systems that offer teachers the opportunity to reflect on their professional identity and experience and that make clear <b>connections</b> between <b>supervision</b> and school mission may be particularly productive. ...|$|R

The inquiry involved an established professional development group of supervisors, of which the researcher was a member, and their associated supervisors in a four stage process of dialogue and reflection. From the data, experiences and expressions of spirituality in supervision were clustered under the themes of magical and memorable moments, ordinariness, <b>connections</b> within the <b>supervision</b> relationship, supervisor choice, strength-based practice, the use of ritual and ways of asking questions. These experiences and activities were believed important to practicing biculturally and holistically. They were found to provide benefits not just in supervision but also in work with clients and in the practitioner's wider life and self-care. Conscious practice {{and the use of}} supervisee-appropriate language and questions was a consequence of participant research involvement. Ethical cautions regarding spirituality in supervision are identified and ways of advancing these are discussed.

40|$|During {{the past}} several decades, {{instructional}} supervision and professional development {{have been identified as}} vehicles to enhance the performance of teachers. One of the most critical problems facing the profession is how to improve the development of beginning teachers. The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine beginning teachers’ perceptions of actual and ideal approaches to supervision and their perceived connection to professional development in Canadian and Ukrainian high schools. The study was based on the belief that the supervisory process should be a collaborative effort reflecting the professional concerns of the individual teacher. The study was based on the belief that the supervisory process should be a collaborative effort reflecting the professional concerns of the individual teacher. The conceptual framework dwelt upon supervisory choices for beginning teachers, namely collaboration with supervisors or peers, and self-reflection. Stemming from the need for improved supervision of teachers was a need to develop a <b>connection</b> between <b>supervision</b> and professional development for the purpose of instructional improvement. Quantitative and qualitative methods of inquiry were used in this study. The survey was used to elicit teachers’ points of view and to establish a profile of the supervision experiences of high school teachers in their first years of teaching in the areas of Saskatoon, Canada and Chernivtsi, Ukraine. The sample consisted of 22 teachers in Canada and 26 teachers in Ukraine. The qualitative data were obtained through the use of semi-structured interviews that incorporated open-ended questions. Interviews were conducted with four of the survey respondents in each country. Participants’ responses were analyzed according to the research questions and recurring themes. The findings revealed that in both countries beginning teachers desired more frequent use of supervision that meets their individual professional needs. A choice in supervisory approaches, better planning, and active involvement in decision making process regarding the supervisory practices were viewed as being beneficial for them. Beginning teachers advocated a need for supervision that promotes trust and collaboration, and that provides them with support, advice, and help. Respondents advocated supervision that is closely connected to professional development. They expressed the desire to grow professionally and improve their instruction in order to provide quality education for students. Participant responses, for the most part, aligned with the literature which indicated that beginning teachers need extensive supervisory assistance. A number of implications were derived for theory, practice, and further research...|$|R

Besides knowing the vast rough and generally traceless country {{so well that}} was to be the scene of a most difficult two years’ war that he could unfailingly find an objective even at night, he had every other desired quality. Brave as a lion, but never rash, with a physique so powerful as to endure almost unheard-of strain and hardship; a dead shot with rifle or revolver, and so loyal and unerring in his advice that General Crook learned to trust him utterly. Knowing every trait of the Indian as well as he knew himself, he proved invaluable. We later on had many scouts such as Buffalo Bill and others of newspaper notoriety, but never another like Frank Grouard. With it all, he was modest and reserved almost to a fault. We all learned to like and admire him, and {{at the close of the}} war, General Crook’s promise was made good. He was employed by the government in various capacities on the frontier in <b>connection</b> with Indian <b>supervision,</b> until his death many years later.” Captain Bourke said: “Grouard was one of the most remarkable woodsmen I ever met. No Indian could surpass him in his acquaintance with all that pertain to the topography and animal life. No question could be asked him that he could not answer at once and correctly. His bravery and fidelity were never questioned; he never flinched under fire, and never growled at privation.” ...|$|R
40|$|When {{practitioners}} and supervisors {{do not share}} the same counselling language or theoretical orientation, how is shared meaning achieved and relational <b>connection</b> sustained in <b>supervision?</b> How are differences in theoretical orientation negotiated in supervision in ways that open space for collaborative, generative dialogue and critical reflection {{on the politics of}} practice? In response to these questions, this thesis presents a critical, reflexive practitioner-inquiry exploring the possibilities and limitations a social constructionist and narrative approach to supervision makes possible for students learning apolitical, humanistic approaches to counselling. Positioned in theoretical landscapes of social constructionism, feminist poststructuralism and Narrative Therapy, this study is a reflection-in-action of a supervisor’s practice. Central to the study’s argument is discursive positioning theory; the associated concepts of relational identity, authorship and agency; and the self as a storying subject. Two student counsellors and two newly qualified counsellors, whose practice was shaped by structuralist, humanistic theories, and who were already engaged in supervision, participated in the study. Employing narrative practices of co-inquiry to generate data, a series of supervision sessions were recorded, reviewed individually by supervisor and practitioner/participant and later discussed in reflective/research meetings. Using a critically reflexive approach to discourse analysis, selected data-texts were explored for moments of discursive dissonance and moments of movement in practice development and professional identity. Research findings highlighted the need for explicit supervision working agreements, theoretical transparency, and encouragement by counsellor training/education providers for students to make fuller use of supervision as a critical learning space. It identifies three processes that might inform supervision when theoretical orientations are non-aligned. These are: supervision as critical reflexivity, supervision as a socio-political conversation, and supervision as a storying practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} project {{deals with}} project supervision of volunteer work {{as seen in}} two select cases; Danske GymnasiersSammenslutning and SprøjtehusTeatret. With a methodological approach based in hermeneutics, this assignment attempts to examine the fashion in which technical ra-tional supervision sense {{can be used in}} <b>connection</b> with the <b>supervision</b> of volunteers. Further-more, some light will be shed on the issue of what other tools can be deemed usable for projects of a similar nature, in which the technical rational supervision sense might conceivably fall short, knowingly or otherwise. The inductive approach will be applied to two interviews to which the theories of Frederick Taylor and Edgar Schein will be added, when relevant to the intended area of inquiry. The chosen thesis statement is as follows: “To what extent is it necessary to supplement technical rational supervision sense with alternative tools when supervising volunteers?” Through the studious endeavors in the analyses and discussions of the assignment it has become apparent that one ought to supervise in a different manner during projects in which the partici-pants do not receive a salary. Both organizations consider motivation to be essential, working tire-lessly to improve it. The preservation of vigour and motivation is the key to a successful project, as opposed to strict rules of conduct. Seeing how a project leader cannot reasonably have the same expectations for volunteers as with paid employees, special attention must be paid to the culture and identity of the individual organizations. The principles of technical rational supervision will remain at the disposal of these organizations. They will, however, have to take other factors into account...|$|R
40|$|The Article {{examines}} assumptions behind {{literature that}} uncritically assumes that securitization transactions are necessarily efficient, finding that these assumptions are unwarranted. The Article {{is the first}} to view securitization transactions from an unsecured creditor’s perspective, and concludes that from such a perspective, securitization is not the panacea its proponents claim it to be. The article first defines structured finance and describes the nature of the current market for asset-backed securities. Then, it outlines the benefits that securitization provides to originators and other transaction participants. With that background, it turns to the debate on the efficiency of secured transactions, applies the substance of this debate to structured finance transactions, and then examines the equitable challenges that may be made to avoid securitized asset transfers. The Article sounds a cautionary note concerning how securitization results in a general increase in the availability of credit beyond what may be called for by the common welfare. It also questions the widespread assumption that unsecured creditors have knowingly consented to all possible consequences of the securitization transactions in which they participate. Finally, it demonstrates how the rapid expansion of the securitization market has subjected transaction participants and third parties to mounting uncertainty. The article predicts that further research will support the conclusion that securitization is inefficient. The securitization structure is designed to divert value away from the originator, {{in the absence of any}} compensating controls on either the consideration received in exchange for the asset sale, or the debtor’s behavior The originator enjoys the benefits of this distributional inefficiency, at the expense of its unsecured creditors. The article predicts that courts, in the name of equity, will more carefully examine the structure of securitized transactions in <b>connection</b> with their <b>supervision</b> of an originator’s bankruptcy case. When the effects of these transactions are realized, courts and legislatures will take steps to address the distributional inefficiency of these transactions. Given the array of possible widespread and negative consequences of securitization, further exploration of the effects of securitization is urgent. Securitization is an innovation that, like many Wall Street innovations, may have drastically negative consequence...|$|R
