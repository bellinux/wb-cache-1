Retail banking which is something known as personal financing services is what most people think of as high street naming it concerns providing financial products and services, such as bank and saving accounts insurance and mortgages to individuals. Some banks also include their business banking wing in their retail banking division.

Retail banking sector of TBL is divided into 3 parts deposit products, loan products and cards. Firstly retail banking of trust bank consists of their wide range of deposit products such as <b>current</b> <b>savings</b> <b>account,</b> fixed deposit account, trust money double scheme, smart saver scheme, Lakhopoti scheme and so on. Secondly retail loan which can be secured (home loan, car loan) or unsecured loan (personal loan, education loan). Thirdly, card division which offers 4 types of TBL cards such as debit card, credit card, prepaid card and Proprietary Card. However, the main focus behind working on the topic was also to find out whether the customers are getting what they actually want from the retail banking facilities provided by TBL or not. The Questionnaire method was used to analyze the collected and available data in this report.

CASA ratio {{of a bank}} is the ratio of {{deposits}} in <b>current</b> and <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> to total deposits. A higher CASA ratio indicates a lower cost of funds, because banks do not usually give any interests on current account deposits and the interest on <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> is usually very low 3-4%. If {{a large part of}} a bank's deposits comes from these funds, it means that the bank is getting those funds at a relative lower cost. It is generally understood that a higher CASA ratio leads to higher net interest margin. In India, it is used as one of the metrics to assess the profitability of a bank.|$|R

40|$|Policymakers {{around the}} world call for more {{competition}} in the banking sector. One barrier to achieving this goal is consumer inertia. Despite its policy relevance, there is surprisingly little known about consumers’ bank switching behaviour. By applying the switching costs typology developed by Burnham et al. (2003), we show that switching costs differ across banking products and therefore we posit that banking products should be studied separately. We show that the propensity to switch varies across banking products (i. e. main <b>current</b> <b>account,</b> <b>savings</b> <b>account,</b> mortgage loan and revolving credit). We find that the bank-customer relationship explains the propensity to switch main <b>current</b> and <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> best, while the switching experience {{is the most important}} explanatory factor for the propensity to switch mortgage loans. We also report on perceived switching barriers and we test the effectiveness of policy initiatives to ease switching banks for current accounts. We find that the propensity to switch can be increased by introducing account number portability, whereas more knowledge of the switching service has no significant effect. Lastly we find that it will be especially difficult for foreign banks to attract customers...|$|R

40|$|A basic {{tenet of}} {{relationship}} marketing is that firms benefit more from maintaining long-term customers; however, {{it is not}} clear whether the need for maintaining personal banking services of long-term and active customers (e. g., <b>current</b> <b>savings</b> <b>accounts)</b> is in the best interest of bank profitability (Reinartz and Kumar, 2000). The primary objective of this study is to provide a rigorous and differentiated empirical analysis of the lifetime and active-profitability relationship in a non-contractual service context. In this study, the authors find that, in personal bank service scenarios, the most valuable customers are those who are less active and have high account balances. Moreover, the correlation between customer activity, lifetime length, and profitability is not significantly positive; long customer lifetimes do not necessarily increase revenue or decrease the cost of customer service. Furthermore, a large number of transactions do not necessarily indicate a high lifetime value, and not all active customers contribute to large bank profits. The authors develop plausible explanations for findings that go against available evidence in the literature, which can help managers focus their efforts on more profitable customers. The authors also draw several marketing implications and acknowledge the limitations of this study...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that there is still low compliance reported in the payment of zakat. However, most of the researchers only focused on the payment of zakat on employment income. An increasing number of people are reported to save their money in saving, fixed deposit and <b>current</b> <b>saving</b> <b>accounts.</b> The collection of zakat on saving is the third highest collection reported by Jabatan Zakat Negeri Kedah after zakat on employment income and zakat on trade. As such, this study is motivated to investigate zakat compliance intention on saving among employees of Universiti Utara Malaysia by using theory of planned behavior. A total of 86 questionnaires were returned and used to measure the three independent variables which are attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control towards the intention to comply with zakat on saving. Based on the results obtained, perceived behavioral control was found to significantly influence intention to comply with zakat on saving, but attitude and subjective norms have no significant influence at all. Generally, theory of planned behavior can be used to explain zakat compliance intention behavior on saving. The findings of the present study can be used for the institution of zakat and policy makers to promote and educate the general public as to the importance of zakat on employment income. The implication of the findings to future research and the limitations of the present study are also highlighted...|$|R
