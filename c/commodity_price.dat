Since the default in 2001, growth has resumed, with the Argentine economy growing by over 6% a year for seven of the eight years to 2011.

25|$|State {{intervention}} in marketing peasant produce was justified in colonial times as protecting farmers against <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> fluctuations. However, in ADMARC, development and profit-making were given priority of over price stabilization. At first, ADMARC accumulated substantial profits and re-invested {{them in a}} range of private companies and statutory corporations. Compared to those its neighbours Tanzania, Zambia, and later Mozambique and Zimbabwe, Malawi’s parastatal bodies were less bureaucratic and aimed to be business-like and profitable. In particular, its ADMARC was considered efficient until 1980. With an economic decline {{at the start of the}} 1980s, the flaws in its strategy became apparent. Profit accumulation had reduced the economic well-being of the peasant producers. The main beneficiaries of this strategy were the political elite who controlled organisations sponsored by ADMARC, the urban population obtaining subsidised food and the employees of ADMARC and other state bodies. Transferring resources away from smallholders to the state led to corruption and abuse of office. In 1977, a long serving ADMARC chairman was convicted for misusing corporation property in his private businesses and of making large unauthorised loans to a private company in which he and family were involved. Corruption and general inefficiency in statutory corporations including ADMARC resulted in a 1980 law limiting their holding office for a renewable two year period. This was not followed by any change in ADMARC's business activities or its conflicting roles as a marketing organization and provider of development finance.|$|E

[...] He claimed that English beer was occasionally mixed with molasses, honey, vitriol, pepper and even opium. Among the most shocking customs he pointed out was the practice of adding fishberries, part of the Menispermaceae family, to port. It became evident during the French Revolutionary Wars that the practice was getting out of hand, and Accum attributed the intoxicating power of the drink to the addition of this plant matter. Accum used various sources to substantiate his claims. As evidence for his claims about Cocculus indicus he used, among others, import statistics, which he complemented with observations about when the price of Cocculus indicus from <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> lists of brewing materials merchants increased. He also looked at historic price trends for the same commodities.|$|E

In 2012 capital costs for wind turbines were substantially lower than 2008–2010 but still above 2002 levels.

As Chart 1 illustrates, in 1992 the <b>price</b> of non-oil <b>commodities</b> relative to that of manufactures reached its lowest level in over 90 years. 1 The longterm behavior of real <b>commodity</b> <b>prices</b> would thus appear to lend some support to the well-known Pre bisch-Singer hypothesis. 2 This pattern in <b>commodity</b> <b>prices</b> has important practical implications for policymakers.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{examined}} the equality of export and import <b>commodities</b> <b>price</b> index in Nigeria. The source of data employed {{in this study is}} secondary data obtained from the Central bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin 2010. The statistical tool used in analyzing the data was the Permutation method for Hotelling T-Squared and Descriptive statistics. The result of the analysis showed that there exists a significant difference between monthly export and import <b>commodities</b> <b>price</b> index in Nigeria with a test statistic value of 58. 31 and a p-value of 0. 00 for 10, 000 permutations. Also, it was observed that across the years import <b>commodities</b> <b>price</b> index has been greater than export <b>commodities</b> <b>price</b> index. Hence, we conclude that export and import <b>commodities</b> <b>price</b> index in Nigeria are not equal and that import <b>commodities</b> <b>price</b> index has always been lager than export <b>commodities</b> <b>price</b> index. We advocate for more studies within the context of price statistics in Nigeria since the significance of price statistics in the economy of any nation cannot be overemphasized because they constitute a very useful tool for policy making, economic planning, analysis and monitoring. Also, price signals have been found to enhance better understanding of the degree of economic stability in any nation...|$|R
40|$|This work {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} real interest rates and <b>commodity</b> <b>prices.</b> According to Frankel’s hypothesis (1986 - 2006) : "low real interest rates lead to high real commodity prices". However, some empirical evidence suggests that <b>commodity</b> <b>prices</b> can predict monetary policy. In this way, there is an endogeneity between <b>commodity</b> <b>prices</b> and monetary policy. Using Frankel’s model we include a Taylor rule equation in this theoretical model, which let us analyze the endogeneity problem. In order to find empirical support of this model, we estimate SVAR and, using quarterly data from 1962 :Q 1 to 2009 :Q 1, {{we find that the}} overshooting of <b>commodity</b> <b>prices</b> to 1 % increase of real interest rate can be a minimum of 2. 86 % and a maximum of 5. 97 % depending on the chosen model.
