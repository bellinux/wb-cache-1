You will not, indeed, be able, if you attend {{properly}} to your coloring, to get anything like the quantity of form you could in a chiaroscuro sketch; nevertheless, {{if you do not}} dash or rush at your work, nor do it lazily, you may always get enough form to be satisfactory. An extra quarter of an hour, distributed in quietness {{over the course of the}} whole study, may just make the difference between a quite intelligible drawing, and a slovenly and obscure one. If you determine well beforehand what outline each piece of color is to have, and, when it is on the paper, guide it without nervousness, as far as you can, into the form required; and then, after it is dry, <b>consider</b> <b>thoroughly</b> what touches are needed to complete it, before laying one of them on; you will be surprised to find how masterly the work will soon look, as compared with a hurried or ill-considered sketch. In no process that I know of--least of all in sketching--can time be really gained by precipitation. It is gained only by caution; and gained in all sorts of ways; for not only truth of form, but force of light, is always added by an intelligent and shapely laying of the shadow colors. You may often make a simple flat tint, rightly gradated and edged, express a complicated piece of subject without a single retouch. The two Swiss cottages, for instance, with their balconies, and glittering windows, and general character of shingly eaves, are expressed in Fig. 30 with one tint of gray, and a few dispersed spots and lines of it; all of which you ought to be able to lay on without more than thrice dipping your brush, and without a single touch after the tint is dry.|$|E

60|$|But if any extreme {{disturbance}} (as {{sometimes it}} happens) possesses our whole mind, {{as when the}} pain of the rack, an impetuous uneasiness, as of love, anger, or any other violent passion, running away with us, allows us not the liberty of thought, and we are not masters enough of our own minds to <b>consider</b> <b>thoroughly</b> and examine fairly;--God, who knows our frailty, pities our weakness, and requires of us no more than we are able to do, and sees what was and what was not in our power, will judge as a kind and merciful Father. But the forbearance of a too hasty compliance with our desires, the moderation and restraint of our passions, so that our understandings may be free to examine, and reason unbiassed, give its judgment, being that whereon a right direction of our conduct to true happiness depends; it is in this we should employ our chief care and endeavours. In this we should take pains to suit the relish of our minds to the true intrinsic good or ill that is in things; and not permit an allowed or supposed possible great and weighty good to slip out of our thoughts, without leaving any relish, any desire of itself there till, by a due consideration of its true worth, we have formed appetites in our minds suitable to it, and made ourselves uneasy in the want of it, or in the fear of losing it. And how much this is in every one's power, by making resolutions to himself, such as he may keep, is easy for every one to try. Nor let any one say, he cannot govern his passions, nor hinder them from breaking out, and carrying him into action; for what he can do before a prince or a great man, he can do alone, or in the presence of God, if he will.|$|E

From an ardent and (as befits a soldier) confident wooer of that coy bride, the popular favor, we see him subside of a sudden into the (I trust not jilted) Cincinnatus, returning to his plough with a goodly sized branch of willow in his hand; figuratively returning, however, to a figurative plough, and from no profound affection for that honored implement of husbandry (for which, indeed, Mr. Sawin never displayed any decided predilection), {{but in order to}} be gracefully summoned therefrom to more congenial labors. It should seem that the character of the ancient Dictator had become part of the recognized stock of our modern political comedy, though, as our term of office extends to a quadrennial length, the parallel is not so minutely exact as could be desired. It is sufficiently so, however, for purposes of scenic representation. An humble cottage (if built of logs, the better) forms the Arcadian background of the stage. This rustic paradise is labelled Ashland, Jaalam, North Bend, Marshfield, Kinderhook, or Bâton Rouge, as occasion demands. Before the door stands a something with one handle (the other painted in proper perspective), which represents, in happy ideal vagueness, the plough. To this the defeated candidate rushes with delirious joy, welcomed as a father by appropriate groups of happy laborers, or from it the successful one is torn with difficulty, sustained alone by a noble sense of public duty. Only I have observed, that, if the scene be laid at Bâton Rouge or Ashland, the laborers are kept carefully in the backgrouud, and are heard to shout from behind the scenes in a singular tone resembling ululation, and accompanied by a sound not unlike vigorous clapping. This, however, may be artistically in keeping with the habits of the rustic population of those localities. The precise connection between agricultural pursuits and statesmanship I have not been able, after diligent inquiry, to discover. But, that my investigations may not be barren of all fruit, I will mention one curious statistical fact, which I <b>consider</b> <b>thoroughly</b> established, namely, that no real farmer ever attains practically beyond a seat in the General Court, however theoretically qualified for more exalted station.|$|E

40|$|A {{first impulse}} {{to write this}} article came from noticing, while reading Descartes' "Meditations", that author gives {{different}} meaning {{to the idea of}} "doubt" in each part of book. In First Meditation "doubt" has a function of a unique method of research, first step to build new, strictly rational and scientific knowledge – in contrast to the former collection of unjustified and un-proved or even false conceptions. Therefore "doubt" has positive value. So why does Descartes in his evidence of God's existence in Third Meditation, talks about "doubt" as if it were imperfection and weakness of human nature? As if it were something worthless and part of "nothingness"? The only way to resolve this contradiction is to <b>consider</b> <b>thoroughly</b> what the role of "doubt" is in each part of "Meditations". Then, it will be clear that in Descartes' "Meditations" problem of knowledge is strictly attached to problem of existence, and how order of cognition changes without notice into cognition of Divine Order...|$|E
40|$|Mixed-methods research, which {{comprises}} both {{quantitative and}} qualitative components, is widely perceived {{as a means to}} resolve the inherent limitations of traditional single method designs and is thus expected to yield richer and more holistic findings. Despite such distinctive benefits and continuous advocacy from Information Systems (IS) researchers, the use of mixed-methods approach in the IS field has not been high. This paper discusses some of the key reasons that led to this low application rate of mixed-methods design in the IS field, ranging from misunderstanding the term with multiple-methods research to practical difficulties for design and implementation. Two previous IS studies are used as examples to illustrate the discussion. The paper concludes by recommending that in order to apply mixed-methods design successfully, IS researchers need to plan and <b>consider</b> <b>thoroughly</b> how the {{quantitative and qualitative}} components (i. e. from data collection to data analysis to reporting of findings) can be genuinely integrated together and supplement one another, in relation to the predefined research questions and the specific research contexts...|$|E

These are all concepts we all have in mind {{when we think about}} what is happening in our environment with developments in technology.

The key aspect of this paper is how to empower children in their daily Internet browsing by introducing media literacy at primary school. To this end this paper will present the results of a media literacy project named “Conectados ” which introduces media literacy in the classroom using one specific tool: the iPad.

40|$|The {{elaboration}} of a systematic evaluative framework of conflicts law, {{which should be}} probed and refined in further study is the central juristic aim of the third phase of the project on Trade Liberalisation and Social Regulation. It {{is at the same}} time a reference point in the Subproject on Transnational Governance, Deliberative Supranationalism and Constitutionalism of WP 9 of the RECON project. We have described our approach as a „three-dimensional conflicts law”. The development of this idea started with the first presentation the work of this project (Joerges & Godt 2006) and was continuously elaborated further (see Joerges & Rödl 2009 a and the contributions in the RECON Report 7 / 2009 (Nickel 2009 and also Joerges and Falke forthcoming). Our approach is by no means idiosyncratic. There are more or less closely related legal analyses and theoretical constructs. In Germany above all, but also beyond its borders, there are academic legal and interdisciplinary debates and projects which are in many respects akin to our considerations and in relation to which we would like precisely to orientate and situate our work (in particular Fischer-Lescano & Teubner 2006; Howse & Nicolaïdis 2008).

40|$|To ensure {{aircraft}} safety, it {{is critical}} to exclude large mammal species such as deer (Odocoileus spp.), feral swine (Sus scrofa), and coyotes (Canis latrans) from airport environments, as well as to <b>consider</b> <b>thoroughly</b> and carefully all available management methods. Airports are often located on or adjacent to undeveloped land that provides habitat for various species large enough to pose a direct hazard to aircraft. Unoccupied expanses of forage near runways provide deer with sufficient incentive to leave cover and occupy airport lands. Associated risk and tragic collisions have ranked deer as the most hazardous wildlife group to aviation (Dolbeer et a 1. 2000, DeVault et a 1. 2011), necessitating the evaluation of appropriate means for excluding them and other medium to large mammals (Dolbeer et aJ. 2000). Exclusionary fences are the most effective, long-lasting, and straightforward tool for eliminating risks posed by deer and other large mammals at airports; however, these fences can be costly to purchase, erect, and maintain. Fences provide a visual sense of security for airport managers but also can accomplish a measurable and statistically significant level of protection to aircraft at airports (DeVault et aJ. 2008). A variety of evaluations and experiments have been conducted on fence options. Determining the most appropriate fence for a specific setting to accomplish a desired outcome can be challenging. When reviewing this body of literature, airport managers must consider the level of motivation among deer or other species in the experiment and relate it to their situation. In this chapter we review a variety of fence applications for excluding medium to large mammals and provide recommendations...|$|E
