40|$|The {{development}} of high resolution, room temperature semiconductor radiation detectors requires {{the introduction of}} materials with increased carrier mobility-lifetime ({mu}{tau}) product, while having a band gap in the 1. 4 - 2. 2 eV range. AlSb {{is a promising material}} for this application. However, systematic improvements in the material quality are necessary to achieve an adequate {mu}{tau} product. We are using a combination of simulation and experiment to develop a fundamental understanding of the factors which affect detector material quality. First principles calculations are used to study the microscopic mechanisms of mobility degradation from point defects and to calculate the intrinsic limit of mobility from phonon scattering. We use density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the formation energies of native and impurity point defects, to determine their equilibrium concentrations as a function of temperature and charge state. Perturbation theory via the Born approximation is coupled with Boltzmann transport theory to calculate the contribution toward mobility degradation of each type of point defect, using DFT-computed carrier scattering rates. A comparison is made to measured carrier concentrations and mobilities from AlSb crystals grown in our lab. We find our predictions in good quantitative agreement with experiment, allowing optimized annealing conditions to be deduced. A major result is the determination of oxygen impurity as a severe mobility killer, despite the ability of oxygen to <b>compensation</b> <b>dope</b> AlSb and reduce the net carrier concentration.

40|$|Due to the {{increase}} in the demand for more efficient and reliable power switches, gallium nitride based devices have been long foreseen as eventual replacement for silicon technology. Due to their superior material properties, GaN-based devices are able to deliver much higher output power and handle higher driving voltages than their silicon counterparts for the same die area. GaN-based devices still face significant hurdles towards an industrial integration in the current power electronics, as these devices still fall short from their actual potential with record devices still significantly distant from the theoretical material limits. GaN on silicon (or GaN-on-Si) represents a viable solution for a wider adoption of GaN devices. On one hand, GaN-on-Si technology will benefit from the well-established Si foundries for device processing. On the other hand, the availability of large-diameter silicon wafers will bring down manufacturing costs. Growing GaN on a foreign substrate such as silicon will add, nonetheless, epitaxial complexity higher dislocation densities which can jeopardize the device performance. During the course of this work, DC and dynamic properties of power transistors fabricated on GaN-on-Si wafers are intensively investigated. The analysis is focused on the voltage-blocking capabilities and the losses in conduction during dynamic operation of these transistors. These two parameters were chosen as they represent the most straightforward criteria in choosing an efficient and reliable transistor for a power switch. The voltage-blocking capabilities of the devices are limited by the leakage current flowing through the device in the off-state. The source of this leakage current is due to carrier injection from the grounded silicon substrate and the background doping of the GaN buffer. To tackle the first problem, the source of the injected carriers was suppressed via altering the initial growth conditions of the GaN-on-Si epitaxial stack. To address the second challenge, <b>compensation</b> <b>doping</b> of the GaN buffer using carbon was adopted. Losses in electrical conduction during dynamic operation in GaN devices stems from incomplete recovery of trapped charge carriers. This phenomenon takes place either on the device surface or in the GaN buffer due to surface traps or bulk traps, respectively. Proper surface passivation with PECVD SiNX proves to be the most effective in suppressing surface trapping. This leaves buffer trapping — for example due to carbon <b>compensation</b> <b>doping</b> — as the main contributor to conduction losses during dynamic operation. Specially devised back-gated techniques are used to characterize buffer trapping mechanisms. These techniques were adopted to investigate the effects of various growth parameters and carbon incorporation techniques on the dynamic properties of the GaN buffers. The analysis pointed to the intricate role of charge transport and charge injection in trapping/de-trapping of charge carriers in the GaN buffer...|$|E
40|$|In most {{semiconductors}} and insulators {{the presence}} of a small density of charged impurities cannot be avoided, but their effect can be reduced by <b>compensation</b> <b>doping,</b> i. e. by introducing defects of opposite charge. Screening in such a system leads to the formation of electron-hole puddles, which dominate bulk transport, as first recognized by Efros and Shklovskii. Metallic surface states of topological insulators (TI) contribute extra screening channels, suppressing puddles. We investigate the typical length l_p, which determines the distance between puddles and the suppression of puddle formation close to metallic surfaces in the limit where the gap Δ is much larger than the typical Coulomb energy E_c of neighboring dopants, Δ≫ E_c. In particular, this is relevant for three dimensional Bi-based topological insulators, where Δ/E_c ∼ 100. Scaling arguments predict l_p ∼ (Δ/E_c) ^ 2. In contrast, we find numerically that l_p is much smaller and grows in an extended crossover regime approximately linearly with Δ/E_c for numerically accessible values, Δ/E_c ≲ 35. We show how a quantitative scaling argument can be used to extrapolate to larger Δ/E_c, where l_p ∼ (Δ/E_c) ^ 2 /(Δ/E_c).

40|$|A {{thin film}} {{semiconductor}} device was grown by MBE methods, characterized for material quality and evaluated for suitability as a room temperature gamma radiation detector. The {{objective was to}} produce a device that was superior to current semiconductor detectors, namely HPGe and CZT which have different limitations due to intrinsic material characteristics. AlSb was chosen because of its desirable properties which include the high atomic number of antimony (Z = 51), relatively large band gap (Eg = 1. 6 eV), and theorized high dual carrier mobility. Simulations were performed using MCNP 5 to predict energy deposited in AlSb by low energy gammas from Ba- 133 and Co- 57. A benchmark model was developed using a silicon surface barrier detector to validate AlSb simulations. Prior to radiation experiments, {{a series of characterization}} methods were employed to evaluate the material quality. Surface features were measured by Nomarski imaging and AFM, revealing an orange peel texture and screw dislocations. The material composition was examined using XRD and the AlSb layer was observed to be fairly narrow along the lattice axis indicating reduced strain on the lattice structure. Electrical measurements were conducted which exposed low values for resistivity (ρ = 10 - 3 Ω-cm) and average carrier mobility (~ 100 cm 2 /Vs), and a high hole concentration (~ 1019 cm- 3). I-V curves indicated a leaky nature for the diode, and it is suspected that Zener breakdown was occurring. During radiation experiments, no signal was observable above noise levels. The high hole concentration may have contributed to this result by eliminating the intended intrinsic region between the electrodes.

40|$|Infrared {{detectors}} {{based on}} compound semiconductor technology {{are on the}} verge of outperforming HgCdTe, the leading infrared material for the past 50 years. The driving force behind this change has been the development of new detector designs based on the 6. 1 ï¿½ lattice constant, which includes GaSb, AlSb, and InAs binary materials. While the epitaxial deposition of these materials on GaSb substrates has enabled high performance devices, key limitations still exist. The lack of a large diameter, semi-insulating substrate; a mature, ohmic n-contact to GaSb; and a low k, large bandgap material for avalanche multiplication are all key weaknesses of this material system that further limit device development. These challenges can be met by the introduction of a new epitaxial growth mode. The growth mode, an interfacial misfit array (IMF), enables the epitaxial deposition of a high quality, relaxed GaSb epilayer on a GaAs substrate without the creation of residual threading dislocations. The IMF achieves this feat through the creation of a 90 ï¿½ dislocation network at the GaSb/GaAs interface, i. e. a gallium dangling bond every 14 GaAs lattice sites. In this dissertation, the structural, electrical, and optical characterization of IMF-based material and devices are all described. X-ray diffraction experiments are used to show that the dislocation network is nearly perfectly correlated, i. e. there is a 99 % correlation between the location of one Lomer dislocation in the IMF network and its adjacent dislocations. Further evidence is given that the material is over 99. 5 % relaxed after 250 nm of growth, and continues to relax as the GaSb epilayer becomes thicker. Optical RF measurements of GaSb p-i-n homojunctions on GaAs semi-insulating substrates show that the IMF is capable of passing high frequency signals, and that the background acceptor concentration can be reduced to approximately 2 x 1016 cm- 3 using Tellurium <b>compensation</b> <b>doping.</b> C-V profiles of one-sided GaAs junctions indicate that the gallium dangling bonds at the IMF interface do behave as acceptors, but that the interface charge density is 1. 8 E 12 per sq. cm, as opposed to the Lomer dislocation density of 3 E 12 per sq. cm. And finally, avalanche photodiodes using the IMF interface charge are utilized to create gain in 1. 55 um detectors, with both GaAs and AlGaAs multiplication regions. Low ionization coefficient ratios between holes and electrons (k values) of 0. 1 - 0. 4 are measured, indicating that the ultimate gain bandwidth product for IMF-based devices is several hundred GHz. Delta-doping is also shown to improve the optical response of the devices, without impacting the breakdown voltage or creating a commensurate increase in dark current.

However, it was soon realized that different size samples from the same growth batch showed different carrier densities; smaller samples showed higher carrier densities [70].

In particular, Bi 2 Se 3 nanoribbon studies showed that the surface of Bi 2 Se 3 was oxidized quickly by observing BiOx and SeOx peaks using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy [71]. The same nanoribbons showed two different carrier densities. The Hall carrier density was much higher than the density obtained from SdH oscillations. Because the Hall measurements include all carriers while the SdH measurements sample only the high mobility carriers, the discrepancy in carrier densities was attributed to additional, low-mobility carriers induced by the environmental effects including the surface oxidation. The surface oxidation induces additional scattering events for the topological surface state where the oxidized radicals can act as trap sites or induce charge fluctuations.|$|R

At any rate, it is suggested that the process is kinetically blocked at low temperatures due to very slow thermally activated vacancy diffusion. A thermochemical approach is presented that tentatively explains why the hole conductivity increases with temperature at high temperatures, although the hole concentration decreases, yielding a model compatible with experimental observations and theoretical calculations...|$|R
40|$|Using hybrid density {{functional}} theory, {{we address}} point defects susceptible to cause charge <b>compensation</b> upon Mg <b>doping</b> of GaN. We determine the free energy of {{formation of the}} nitrogen vacancy and of several Mg-related defects. The entropic contribution {{as a function of}} temperature is determined within the quasiharmonic approximation. We find that the Mg interstitial shows a noticeably lower free energy of formation than the Mg substitutional to Ga in p-type conditions. Therefore, the Mg impurity is amphoteric behaving like an acceptor when substitutional to Ga and like a double donor when accommodated in an interstitial position. The hybrid-functional results are then linked to experimental observations by solving the charge neutrality equations for semiconductor dominated by impurities. We show that a thermodynamic equilibrium model is unable to account for the experimental hole concentration as a function of Mg doping density, due to nitrogen vacancies and Mg interstitials acting as compensating donors. To explain the experimental result, which includes a dropoff of the hole concentration at high Mg densities, we thus resort to nonequilibrium models. We show that either nitrogen vacancies or Mg interstitials could be at the origin of the self-compensation mechanism. However, only the model based on interstitial Mg donors provides a natural mechanism to account for the sudden appearance of self-compensation. Indeed, the amphoteric nature of the Mg impurity leads to Fermi-level pinning and accounts for the observed dropoff of the hole concentration of GaN samples at high Mg doping. Our work suggests that current limitations in p-type doping of GaN could be overcome by extrinsically controlling the Fermi energy during growth...|$|R
40|$|Deep-level <b>doping</b> <b>compensation</b> process using {{elemental}} gold is used {{to create}} high resistivity silicon substrate for microwave application. Gold atoms are introduced into low resistivity Czochralski silicon substrates through an ion-implantation process and activated via high-temperature annealings. The highest substrate resistivity recorded for optimised substrates is 60 k-cm. A constant attenuation value of 0. 19 dB/mm is measured at 20 GHz for a bias voltage range of - 6 V to + 6 V, for coplanar waveguides fabricated on this type of substrate, indicating full suppression of parasitic surface conduction effect at microwave frequencies. The attenuation results are supported by the capacitance-voltage characteristics, where the substrate is seen to be insensitive towards bias voltage. Based on a finite element analysis, this effect {{is caused by the}} reduced number of free carriers in the substrate and the increased interface trap densities at the oxide-silicon interface. Optimisation of substrate-processing stages are presented in this work. It is shown that the combination of slow-cooling and quenching for activation annealing provide a higher resistivity enhancement and a lower attenuation compared to single annealing. The removal of the near surface gold to increase substrate's resistivity is found to be unnecessary as it does not provide reduced attenuation. It can therefore be avoided to reduce process complexity. The influence of oxide type is studied, and thermal oxidation is seen to be unsuitable for oxide passivation. Bias-dependent attenuation characteristics suggest gold out-diffusion during the high-temperature treatment. Reactively sputtered oxides do, however, give excellent performance. In addition to coplanar waveguides attenuation responses, quality factor performance of meander inductors fabricated on gold-compensated high resistivity silicon substrate is evaluated. A higher quality factor is recorded for all inductance values for Au-compensated high resistivity silicon compared to Float-zone silicon. The highest quality factor value of 14 is measured for 0. 7 -nH inductors...|$|R
40|$|Vacancy {{defects and}} {{their effect on}} {{electrical}} deactivation in highly doped silicon have been studied using positron annihilation spectroscopy. The dominant vacancy-impurity complexes are identified. The results explain the formation of compensating vacancy-impurity complexes by thermal processes during the growth. The migration kinetics leading to stable defects complexes is studied in detail {{with the help of}} electron irradiation. These results are further applied to understand the defect formation during molecular beam epitaxy under ionimplantation or low temperature growth. In case of As doping the electron irradiation induced vacancy-arsenic pairs (V-As 1) become mobile at 450  K and migrate until stopped by substitutional As to form V-As 2 complexes. Subsequently the V-As 2 complexes start to diffuse at 700  K and create stable V-As 3 complexes by migration. The recovery of V-As 3 defects takes place after 1100  K annealing. Similar defects were observed also in P and Sb doped Si. The formation of V-As 3 defects at 700  K and their annealing at 1100  K are in perfect agreement with the well-known properties of the electrical <b>compensation</b> in highly <b>doped</b> Si. The V-As 3 defect is also the dominant compensating vacancy defect in heavily As-doped MBE grown Si. Larger vacancy complexes, tentatively identified as V 2 -As 5, are also formed at high concentrations. The V-As 3 and V 2 -As 5 complexes are removed by annealings at 800 and 900 °C, respectively. However, they are likely to reconstruct during the cooling down by subsequent migrations of V, V-As and V-As 2. In highly Sb-doped Si grown by molecular beam epitaxy at low temperatures the open volume defects are neighbored by 1  -  2 Sb atoms, and their concentration is large enough to be important for the electrical deactivation. Annealing experiments show that vacancy defects are unstable already at 400  -  500  K and form larger vacancy-Sb complexes, most likely by the migration of V-Sb pairs. The formation of thermal vacancies in highly n-type Si starts already at 700  K and at high temperatures the vacancies are mainly isolated from impurities. Upon cooling down the vacancies are quenched to stable vacancy-impurity complexes such as V-As 3 and V-P 3, which act as electrically compensating defects. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a summary}} of the research effort for the theoretical study, modeling, design, and optimization of solid state photovoltaic devices. The effect of grating structures on the back reflector is studied using electromagnetic modeling and an optimized structure is proposed to enhance the optical absorbance of these devices. Solar cells with optimized arbitrarily shaped gratings exhibit a 29 % improvement over planar cells and 9. 0 % improvement over the optimal cell with periodic gratings. A new model incorporating carrier transport and recombination is proposed and simulation result shows the significance of this model in the modeling of intermediate band solar cell. The material ZnTeO is used as a numerical example for the intermediate band solar cell model. The optimal impurity concentration is determined to be 1018 cm- 3 for an optical absorption cross section of 10 - 14 cm 2. The conversion efficiency of a ZnTe solar cell with a total recombination lifetime of 10 ns is calculated to increase from 14. 39 % to 26. 87 % with the incorporation of oxygen. Fully coupled solution to partial differential equations provides insight into the operation of intermediate band solar cell. A <b>doping</b> <b>compensation</b> scheme is proposed to mitigate the space charge effects, and the device achieves conversion efficiencies of approximately 40 %, similar to the maximum expected values from prior 0 -D models. A spectrally decoupled scheme for subbandgap photovolatics is proposed in which, device structures with non-uniform occupation of intermediate electronic states are employed to reduce the dependence of conversion efficiency on spectral overlap. Solar cell conversion efficiencies are calculated for structures where absorption bands are spatially decoupled due to defined occupation of intermediate states. The spectrally-decoupled device provides a means to achieve high theoretical efficiency independent of spectral overlap that approaches the detailed balance efficiency limit of 63. 2 % for intermediate state devices without spectral overlap. The analysis of experimental work using the model developed for intermediate band solar cell is conducted and ZnTeO alloy is chosen to be the material for intermediate band solar cell, where oxygen states are served as intermediate sites in the fundamental bandgap...|$|R
