50|$|Originally, {{submarine}} cables {{were simple}} point-to-point connections. With {{the development of}} submarine branching units (SBUs), more than one destination could be served by a single cable system. Modern cable systems now usually have their fibers arranged in a self-healing ring to increase their redundancy, with the submarine sections following different paths on the ocean floor. One driver for this development was that the capacity of cable systems had become so large {{that it was not}} possible to completely back-up a cable system with satellite capacity, so it became necessary to provide sufficient terrestrial <b>back-up</b> <b>capability.</b> Not all telecommunications organizations wish to take advantage of this capability, so modern cable systems may have dual landing points in some countries (where <b>back-up</b> <b>capability</b> is required) and only single landing points in other countries where <b>back-up</b> <b>capability</b> is either not required, the capacity to the country is small enough to be backed up by other means, or having back-up is regarded as too expensive.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{comparison between}} phase-shift full-bridge <b>converters</b> <b>with</b> noncoupled and coupled current-doubler rectifier. In {{high current capability}} and high step-down voltage conversion, a phase-shift full-bridge <b>converter</b> <b>with</b> a conventional current-doubler rectifier has the common limitations of extremely low duty ratio and high component stresses. To overcome these limitations, a phase-shift full-bridge <b>converter</b> <b>with</b> a noncoupled current-doubler rectifier (NCDR) or a coupled current-doubler rectifier (CCDR) is, respectively, proposed and implemented. In this study, performance analysis and efficiency obtained from a 500 [*]W phase-shift full-bridge <b>converter</b> <b>with</b> two improved current-doubler rectifiers are presented and compared. From their prototypes, experimental results have verified that the phase-shift full-bridge <b>converter</b> <b>with</b> NCDR has optimal duty ratio, lower component stresses, and output current ripple. In component count and efficiency comparison, CCDR has fewer components and higher efficiency at full load condition. For small size and high efficiency requirements, CCDR is relatively suitable for high step-down voltage and high efficiency applications...|$|R
