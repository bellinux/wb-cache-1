40|$|Thesis (M. S., Civil Engineering (Structural Engineering)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2015. Fatigue {{cracking}} {{in steel}} bridge connections is a prevalent issue faced by our nation???s infrastructure. Many techniques {{have been developed}} to repair or retrofit these structures in an effort to mitigate damages associated with fatigue cracking. A widely used and effective technique is to drill a hole at the tip of a fatigue <b>crack,</b> <b>removing</b> the sharp notch, which drastically reduces the stress field in the surrounding material. While this method has experienced much success, there is limited guidance {{on the size of the}} hole required by the retrofit. Drilling a hole too large removes more material than needed, unnecessarily weakening the section strength and stiffness. On the other hand, drilling a hole too small may insufficiently reduce the stress field, potentially resulting in reinitiation of fatigue cracking. In this thesis, thirty-five finite element models were created to develop a relationship between crack length, hole diameter, and local stress. Using traditional fracture mechanics, a design table is proposed by comparing the local stress intensity to the threshold stress for crack nucleation in structural steel. The table is a function of elastic stress quantities from mechanics formulae and provides guidance toward the selection of an efficiently sized hole diameter to fully arrest crack propagation.

40|$|Oxidation and {{the effects}} of high {{temperature}} exposures on notched fatigue life were considered for a powder metallurgy processed supersolvus heat-treated ME 3 disk superalloy. The isothermal static oxidation response at 704 C, 760 C, and 815 C was consistent with other chromia forming nickel-based superalloys: a TiO 2 -Cr 2 O 3 external oxide formed with a branched Al 2 O 3 internal subscale that extended into a recrystallized - dissolution layer. These surface changes can potentially impact disk durability, making layer growth rates important. Growth of the external scales and dissolution layers followed a cubic rate law, while Al 2 O 3 subscales followed a parabolic rate law. Cr- rich M 23 C 6 carbides at the grain boundaries dissolved to help sustain Cr 2 O 3 growth to depths about 12 times thicker than the scale. The effect of prior exposures was examined through notched low cycle fatigue tests performed to failure in air at 704 C. Prior exposures led to pronounced debits of up to 99 % in fatigue life, where fatigue life decreased inversely with exposure time. Exposures that produced roughly equivalent 1 m thick external scales at the various isotherms showed statistically equivalent fatigue lives, establishing that surface damage drives fatigue debit, not exposure temperature. Fractographic evaluation indicated the failure mode for the pre-exposed specimens involved surface crack initiations that shifted with exposure from predominately single intergranular initiations with transgranular propagation to multi-initiations from the cracked external oxide with intergranular propagation. Weakened grain boundaries at the surface resulting from the M 23 C 6 carbide dissolution are partially responsible for the intergranular <b>cracking.</b> <b>Removing</b> the scale and subscale while leaving a layer where M 23 C 6 carbides were dissolved did not lead to a significant fatigue life improvement, however, also removing the M 23 C 6 carbide dissolution layer led to nearly full recovery of life, with a transgranular initiation typical to that observed in unexposed specimens...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{section of}} gas {{pipeline}} containing dormant stress corrosion <b>cracks</b> was <b>removed</b> from service and pressure cycled, and the crack growth from fatigue was measured. Crack growth {{was able to}} be conservatively calculated by BS 7910. Parts of the pipeline section had composite repair sleeves placed over it in order to compare fatigue crack growth of sleeved and unsleeved cracks. Sleeved cracks consistently showed less crack growth than unsleeved cracks; this is believed to be due to reduced hoop stresses in the pipe under the composite repair sleeve and reduced crack opening. A simple model of the sleeve repair was developed which was consistent with the measured strains in the pipe. The application pressure of the sleeve repair affects the amount of stress reduction in the pipe and the amount of crack growth experienced. Two possible methods of repair of SCC affected pipelines were validated by this work...|$|R

Several schemes had been introduced in this area to provide a set of rules to converge smooth surfaces. However, to compute and render all the vertices are really inconvenient in terms of memory consumption and runtime during the subdivision process. It will lead to a heavy computational load especially at a higher level of subdivision. Adaptive subdivision is a method that subdivides only at certain areas of the meshes. Although subdivision occurs at the selected areas, quality of produced surfaces can be preserved similar to a regular subdivision surfaces. Nevertheless, adaptive subdivision process suffers because of two reasons; calculations need to be done to define areas that required to be subdivided and to <b>remove</b> <b>cracks</b> created from the subdivision depth difference between selected and unselected areas. <b>Cracks</b> must be <b>removed</b> because it creates artifacts in editing, rendering and processing of the mesh.
