40|$|Conversational case-based {{reasoning}} (CBR) systems, which incrementally extract a query description through a user-directed conversation, are advertised for their ease of use. However, designing large <b>case</b> <b>libraries</b> that have good performance (i. e., precision and querying efficiency) is difficult. CBR vendors provide guidelines for designing these libraries manually, but the guidelines {{are difficult to}} apply. We describe an automated inductive approach that revises conversational <b>case</b> <b>libraries</b> to increase their conformance with design guidelines.

40|$|Conversational case-based {{reasoning}} (CCBR) systems {{are used in}} many commercial applications. Their distinguishing behavior is that they interactively acquire features values from users (i. e., they incrementally build queries), and typically address problem diagnosis tasks. Users want CCBR systems to be precise (i. e., retrieve the correct case for solving their problem) and efficient (i. e., require a minimal amount of interaction before cases are retrieved). Case authors require substantial expertise {{to ensure that their}} <b>case</b> <b>libraries</b> satisfy these demands. Commercial CCBR vendors help by supplying documents describing guidelines for designing <b>case</b> <b>libraries,</b> but mastering them involves a challenging learning curve. Software is needed that helps authors to design and refine <b>case</b> <b>libraries</b> according to these design guidelines.

In this paper, the <b>case</b> <b>library</b> of energy loss is constructed to differentiate the crucial factors of energy loss in the different supply regions. First of all, the characteristic state values are selected as {{the representation of the}} cases based on the analysis of energy loss under various voltage classes and in different types of regions. Then, the methods of Grey Relational Analysis and the K-Nearest Neighbor are utilized to implement the critical technologies of <b>case</b> <b>library</b> construction, including case representation, processing, analysis, and retrieval. Moreover, the analysis software of the <b>case</b> <b>library</b> is designed based on the <b>case</b> <b>library</b> construction technology. Some case studies show that there are many differences and similarities concerning the factors that influence the energy loss in different types of regions. In addition, the most relevant sample case can be retrieved from the <b>case</b> <b>library.</b> Compared with the traditional techniques, constructing a <b>case</b> <b>library</b> provides a new way to find out the characteristics of energy loss in different supply regions and constitutes differentiated loss-reducing programs...|$|E

40|$|Case-based {{reasoning}} (CBR) {{provides an}} adequate framework {{to cope with}} continuous domains, where {{a great amount of}} new valuable experiences are generated in a non-stop way. CBR systems become more competent in their evolution over time by means of learning new relevant experiences. There are two central problems derived from the continuous nature of some domains: the fast growing size of the <b>case</b> <b>library</b> and the overhead in the <b>case</b> <b>library</b> organisation. Our proposal to overcome these two problems is to learn only relevant cases, and to establish a lazy learning algorithm for storing cases in the <b>case</b> <b>library.</b> A relevance measure based on L'Eixample distance, and a related ontology of cases are defined, and the lazy learning algorithm is described. Finally, experimental tests on real data are presented and discussed. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
