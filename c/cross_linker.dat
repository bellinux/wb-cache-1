The thermo-sensitive graft-polymer of Gleditsia Sinensis {{polysaccharide}} with N-Isopropyl Acrylamide (NIPAM) {{was prepared}} and cross linked with glutaraldehyde {{to form the}} hydrogel. The effect of reaction conditions on the graft rate and gel strength of Gleditsia Sinesis Polysaccharide-g-NIPAM was evaluated. The graft rate of Gleditsia Sinensis polysaccharide reached the highest value with temperature of 75 °C, reaction time of 5 hours and initiator of 0. 025 % (ratio of initiator to hydrogel, w/w) respectively. The gel strength of hydrogel, generated by the graft-polymer using glutaraldehyde as a <b>cross</b> <b>linker,</b> had a negative correlation with the grafting rate of the polymer. The influence of ionic strength and concentration of <b>cross</b> <b>linker</b> on gel strength, contractibility and Equilibrium Degree of Swelling (EDS) were investigated. The contractibility and gel strength increased with increments of <b>cross</b> <b>linker</b> and NaCl concentration, while EDS decreased with the increasing amount of <b>cross</b> <b>linker</b> and NaCl concentration. FT-IR and XRD were employed to confirm the grafting reaction between NIPAM and Gleditsia Sinensis polysaccharide. There was a great difference of contracting behavior between the thermo-sensitive hydrogel and ordinary hydrogel, which was mainly manifested by the temperature reaching the Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST) of the polymer. The amount of water released from the thermo-sensitive hydrogel per unit time {{was much more than}} the ordinary hydrogel, which was mostly due to the conformation transition of the graft-polymer.

30|$|After {{generating}} a ‘standard’ cryogel and 3 variations of {{that according to}} chemical composition, pore network as well as elasticity the main physical characteristics were analyzed. The absence of gelatin (approach 1) in the material composition affects obviously none morphology nor elasticity. For cryogelation process the formation of ice crystals {{is the most important}} parameter as a template for generating the macroporous network, which can be tuned by freezing temperature and time. It is known that a freezing temperature of − 10 to − 21  °C leads to an optimal interconnected ice crystal system (Svec 2010). Therefore, we kept the freezing temperature stable at − 21  °C and usually the optimal proposed period of 24  h. To investigate the principle influence of freezing time we focused on that in approach 2 and reduced the freezing time in two steps to 1 and 5  h, what influences mainly porosity and pore size. Whereas the <b>cross</b> <b>linker</b> concentration (approach 3) the mechanical strength and elasticity. The higher the amount of <b>cross</b> <b>linker,</b> the stiffer is the material. The fact that porosity decrease in correlation to stiffer and denser material with small pore sizes and thick pore walls (10  % PEGda), but also in correlation with very spongy and elastic material, is reasoned by collapsed pores under pressure and allows the fluid (i.e., mercury) during the measurement to be pressed through the material and enlarge by this way the pores (2.5  % PEGda). Hence, mechanical strength influences indirectly the pore network. The cryogel formation recommends that the cryogelation process depends upon the temperature of freezing and the rate of crosslinking. An increasing of initial monomer/polymer as well as <b>cross</b> <b>linker</b> concentration leads to a faster crosslinking rate at the same temperature (− 21  °C). The gelation process in the polymer solution starts before the porogens (ice crystals) are formed (Kathuria et al. 2009). The faster crosslinking rate implicates formed gels with less porosity, less mechanical strength and brittle nature. The current study reveals the possibility to manipulate the cryogel properties with single parameter of the synthesis process including material composition, freezing time and amount of <b>cross</b> <b>linker.</b>|$|E
