5|$|On November 17, 2009, the library's fifth anniversary saw Clinton {{giving a}} speech to {{approximately}} 1,000 people, urging for the passage of health-care reform and the reduction of energy use. He specifically mentioned the center and school as places where discussion on such topics <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1912, {{challenges}} <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> at any time, {{given the}} appropriate rink conditions, {{and it was}} common for teams to defend the Cup numerous times during the year. In 1912, Cup trustees declared {{that it was only}} to be defended {{at the end of the}} champion team's regular season.|$|E
5|$|The Senate was the {{predominant}} political {{institution in the}} Roman Republic. The Senate's authority derived primarily from custom and tradition. It {{was also one of}} the few places in which free political discussion <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place.</b> The Senate's principal role was as an advisory council to the consuls on matters of foreign and military policy, and it exercised a great deal of influence over consular decision-making.|$|E

5|$|A duel {{was fought}} on the moor in July 1804 between Mr. Jones and Mr. Shakspere Philips. Mr. Jones fired at Mr. Philips without effect and Mr. Philips then fired his pistol in the air, {{upon which the}} seconds interfered, the two man shook hands and honour was satisfied. Two weeks later, two other {{men who had been}} quarrelling in the {{newspapers}} met on the moor to gain satisfaction. However, the magistrates had been informed and the men were arrested before the duel <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to {{the stadium}} was the Empire Pool, which hosted the Olympic aquatic events and was the first-ever indoor Olympic pool. The pool was longer than the Olympic {{standard}} of , so a wooden platform had to be built to reduce the overall length. Due to lack of space, the pool was covered over so that boxing events <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place.</b> The blackout paint which covered all of the venue windows – still remaining from the Second World War – {{had to be removed}} before the Games. The Olympics were the last event to make use of this pool, before it was concreted over.|$|E
5|$|One {{stipulation}} the USACE {{placed on}} the permit, however, was that no work in the Arkansas riverbed <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> after May 1 if it would interfere with the interior least tern nesting period, which was possible if the birds selected nesting sites around the bridge site. As a result, OTA worked to complete the bridge {{as quickly as possible}} to avoid the possibility of having to suspend the construction. By April 1991, work in the riverbed was mostly complete, with the remaining work on the bridge posing no threat to the terns.|$|E

5|$|The Act {{stipulated that}} {{researchers}} {{could not be}} prosecuted for cruelty, but that the animal must be anaesthetized, unless the anaesthesia would interfere with {{the point of the}} experiment. Each animal could be used only once, although several procedures regarded as part of the same experiment were permitted. The animal had to be killed when the study was over, unless doing so would frustrate the object of the experiment. Prosecutions <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> only with the approval of the Home Secretary. At the time of the Brown Dog affair this was Aretas Akers-Douglas, who was unsympathetic to the anti-vivisectionist cause.|$|E
5|$|The {{period between}} the 16th {{and the end of}} the 18th century was {{characterized}} by the existence of self-sufficient regional economies separated by considerable distances, a lack of road, maritime or river communications, and the hazards and hardship of land transport. By the end of the 18th century, a significant national economy came into being, as Argentina developed a market in which reciprocal flows of capital, labour, and goods <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> on a significant scale between its different regions, which it had hitherto lacked.|$|E
5|$|With {{the trilogy}} complete, Puccini {{had to decide}} on {{a place for the}} premiere. In 1918, travel was risky and uncertain. Puccini {{received}} an offer from Buenos Aires which he refused, unwilling to have so complex a work first performed overseas in his absence. He finally agreed that the premiere <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, without his being there, on the basis of performing instructions which he supplied to the conductor. Gianni Schicchi proved to be the last opera completed by Puccini.|$|E

5|$|However, after {{less than}} a month back in York, William died, on 8 June 1154, {{allegedly}} due to poison administered in the chalice at Mass. One of William's clerks accused Osbert de Bayeux, an archdeacon of York, of the murder, and Osbert was summoned before the king to be tried at the royal court. Before the trial <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place,</b> however, Stephen died, and the trial never took place. William was buried in York Minster and within a few months of his death, miracles were attributed to his intervention and a sweet smell came from his tomb when it was damaged during a fire. Nor was the body decayed or burnt in the fire. Pope Honorius III then ordered an investigation into the miracles. In 1227, he was canonised in Rome by Pope Honorius III.|$|E
5|$|Ilya Ulyanov {{died of a}} brain {{haemorrhage}} in January 1886, when Lenin was 16. Subsequently, Lenin's behaviour became erratic and confrontational, and he soon renounced {{his belief}} in God. At the time, Lenin's elder brother Alexander—whom he affectionately knew as Sasha—was studying at Saint Petersburg University. Involved in political agitation against the absolute monarchy of the reactionary Tsar Alexander III, Sasha studied the writings of banned leftists and organised anti-government protests. He joined a revolutionary cell bent on assassinating the Tsar and was selected to construct a bomb. Before the attack <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> the conspirators were arrested and tried, and in May, Sasha was executed by hanging. Despite the emotional trauma of his father's and brother's deaths, Lenin continued studying, graduated with a gold medal for exceptional performance, and decided to study law at Kazan University.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a local {{businessman}} named Louis Edwards began accruing {{shares in}} Manchester United and was eventually made chairman on Hardman's death in 1965. His son, Martin Edwards, purchased {{a percentage of}} shares from Alan Gibson – son of former owner James Gibson – and became the majority shareholder and chairman when Louis Edwards died in 1980. During Martin Edwards' time as chairman, Manchester United {{was the subject of}} several takeover bids; the first came from media tycoon Robert Maxwell, who bid £10million in February 1984, but the sale fell through before any serious talks <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place.</b> In 1989, property magnate Michael Knighton {{was on the verge of}} completing a £20million takeover, but his financial backers pulled out at the last minute and he had to be content with merely a seat on the board.|$|E

5|$|Meetings <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> either {{inside or}} outside of the formal {{boundary}} of the city (the pomerium), though the official meeting place, or curia was at {{the centre of the}} Roman forum. The president of the Senate was normally one of the consuls, but it could be called to meet by any of the praetors or tribunes, both of whom had the authority to call the Senate, though praetors rarely did so unless the consuls were away and the tribunes almost never did so. Meetings were suffused in religious ritual. Temples were a preferred meeting site and auspices would be taken before the meeting could commence.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 2008, Ao {{was found}} guilty on 40 counts of bribe-taking, 13 counts of money laundering, two counts of abuse of power, one count of {{incorrect}} declaration of assets and one count of holding assets from unknown sources; Ao was sentenced to 27 years in prison. About MOP 252 million of his assets in Macau were seized. Ao decided not to appeal. There were concerns voiced in the Macau media that Ao was the fall-guy, as most Macanese were sceptical that corruption on such a scale <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> without anyone else knowing or being involved. During his trial, Ao hinted that contacts valued at in excess of 6 million Patacas required the approval of his superior in government, Edmond Ho.|$|E
5|$|One CMPC {{shooting}} {{location was}} on family property near Boulder Creek, California where Middleton's father {{had established a}} timber holding {{now known as the}} Middleton Tract. Other filming locations included undeveloped portions of Sonoma, Santa Cruz and Marin counties. In San Rafael, the studio boasted a large glass-walled and -roofed building that let in light but not wind so that shooting for indoor scenes <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> in full light without the telltale flapping of tablecloths and clothing blown by gusts. Considered expensive at the time, the company used a 1,250 Bell & Howell movie camera, worth about $ in current value. The camera held two reels of film so that two negatives were made of each scene. A second $700 camera provided a third reel of the same scene, from another perspective.|$|E

5|$|The Foch Line was {{negotiated}} with the Polish war mission, led by General Tadeusz Jordan-Rozwadowski in Paris, while Lithuanian representatives were not invited. The Foch Line had two major modifications compared to the June 18 line: first, the entire line was moved west to give extra protection to the strategic Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway and second, the Suwałki Region, including the towns of Sejny, Suwałki, Puńsk, was assigned to Poland. Despite assurances {{at the time that}} the line was just a temporary measure to normalize the situation before full negotiations <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place,</b> the southern Foch Line has been regarded since then as the border between Lithuania and Poland.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe was {{detailed}} {{to destroy}} Fighter Command before the planned invasion of Britain <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place.</b> The OKL {{hoped that the}} destruction of the British fighter force would force the British to come to terms by air power alone and the very risky Operation Sea Lion would not be needed. The enormous numerical superiority of British naval forces over their German opponents made a crossing of the Channel very dangerous, even with air superiority. Furthermore, the aircraft losses of the spring campaign had weakened the Luftwaffe before the Battle of Britain, and it could not begin its campaign against Fighter Command immediately. It was forced to wait until it had reached acceptable levels before a main assault against the RAF could be made in August 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{match at}} Lord's was the {{following}} Monday, 10 June, {{and this time}} a full match <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> over three days. The North won by 3 wickets after scoring 180 and 226–7 in reply to the South's 202 and 203. Although his team lost, Grace could take consolation from his best batting performance of the season so far, and his first half-century, as he scored 45 and 77. He had 9 wickets in the match with 5–60 and 4–89. The match was played {{for the benefit of}} the Marylebone Professional Cricketers' Fund and drew an attendance of 10,858 on the first day, which was Whit Monday.|$|E
