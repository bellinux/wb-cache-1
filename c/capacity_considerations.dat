The step increase in utilization of cellular networks not only has shorten the recharging cycle of mobile terminals but has further caused a considerable rise in the operators' energy bill.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative analysis of two potentially overlapping concepts: entrepreneurial capacity and absorptive <b>capacity.</b> <b>Consideration</b> {{is given to}} the complex task of distinguishing a nascent theoretical concept from a mature, empirically tested concept without including the presumptions and bias that accompany the nature of comparisons between two potentially competing scientific paradigms. The approach used to analyse the concepts is developed using literature on theory development and results in providing two overarching categories for examination: relevance and utility. The findings provide evidence to support initial observations as to the relative proximity of both concepts with respect to innovation, but ultimately lend ground to our argument that entrepreneurial capacity is highly distinguishable from absorptive capacity, and that the concepts may actually be complimentary. The implications of these findings are significant to the establishment of entrepreneurial capacity as a distinct concept, but also provide an interesting basis for further exploration of how the opportunity school and emergence school that are prevalent within the field may be ultimately streamlined into an alloyed theory of entrepreneurship and innovation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{highlight}} {{the need to}} provide education that represents a business process view of organisational functioning. Following three computer supported methodologies are evaluated first: • traditional simulation • systems dynamics simulation and • business gaming. Operations management decisions usually deal simultaneously with multiple products and production <b>capacity</b> <b>considerations,</b> and issues related to successful sales and efficient purchasing. These are issues which are hard to capture with tools that present momentary, stagnant views of business circumstances. We reason that the potential in transparent business process simulation gaming is probably higher for production and operations management than what is the potential in traditional business games or other computer supported methodologies. This is because transparent and continuously evolving learning environments present the process view of business functioning. Furthermore, we shortly present this kind of continuously evolving business simulation game. This game works in a local area network, where participant groups with their own manufacturing companies can compete against each other in an imaginary market environment. We also analyse, what kind of results continuous gaming has produced in two Production and Operations Management courses, given for the MSc students...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the entire layout design {{problem of a}} manufacturing facility of discrete parts which includes unique as well as functionally identical machines. The problem has been addressed in two distinct stages. The first stage consists of grouping the available machines into manufacturing cells and the parts into part families. The second stage {{addresses the}} determination of proximity of cells and the proximity of machines for inter-cell and intra-cell layouts respectively. The objective in both states is to minimize the weighted traffic of parts in the system. New heuristics have been proposed for both these problems. The cell-formation heuristic {{is based on a}} bottom-up approach which minimizes the total inter-cell material flow within the system. The handling of the functionally identical machines in this formulation is novel and is based on <b>capacity</b> <b>considerations,</b> which are critical in a manufacturing company. The solution in the second stage is based on the method of Simulated Annealing. For some classical layout problems, the proposed method provided results superior to those obtained using existing layout formulations.

30|$|Also as {{discussed}} in Sect.  2, the impact of hazards on a network system can be evaluated using different indicators. The number of effectively impacted airports {{can be used to}} quantify the impact of hazards. Likewise, daily passenger capacity losses of airports in the system can also signify the impact of hazards. An airport with a larger passenger capacity is clearly more important than an airport with a smaller capacity in the civil aviation network system. Thus, in test case 3 of scenario 1, we consider the passenger capacity at the directly impacted airports, that is, when plotting the impact curve, we replace effectively impacted airports with effectively impacted passenger capacities. The result shows that, by including the passenger <b>capacity</b> <b>consideration,</b> the Chinese civil aviation network system is still slightly robust to spatially localized hazards with uniform distribution. The main reason is that most economic activities, which demand larger transportation capacities, including airport capacities, are concentrated in the southeastern area of China. In other words, the spatial distribution of airport passenger capacities is not uniform in reality. Therefore, in terms of directly impacted passenger capacities, the system is robust to spatially localized hazards with a uniform distribution.|$|R
