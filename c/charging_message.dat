50|$|SMS {{language}} {{is similar to}} that used by those sending telegraphs that charged by the word. It seeks to use the fewest number of letters to produce ultra-concise words and sentiments in dealing with space, time and cost constraints of text messaging. This follows from how early SMS permitted only 160 characters and some carriers <b>charge</b> <b>messages</b> by the number of characters sent.|$|R
50|$|The {{main reason}} that {{transliteration}} is used with Russian {{is that in}} text messages you get more Latin characters for your money: usually 160 Latin characters per <b>charged</b> <b>message</b> versus 60/70 Cyrillic script. Obviously the onus is on getting one Latin symbol (of which there are 26) for each Cyrillic symbol (of which there are 33 in Russian, and extra symbols in Ukrainian and other Cyrillic-based languages). Only those used for Russian are exemplified here.|$|R

50|$|Fighting SMS spam is {{complicated}} by several factors, including the lower rate of SMS spam (compared to more abused services such as Internet email), which has allowed many users and service providers to ignore the issue, and the limited availability of mobile phone spam-filtering software. Filtering SMS spam at the recipient device would be an imperfect solution in markets where users are <b>charged</b> to receive <b>messages,</b> as the user may still be <b>charged</b> for the <b>message</b> once the provider sent it, even if software on the device blocked it from appearing on the device's display. This problem is not present {{in most of the}} world outside the U.S., however, where users are not <b>charged</b> to receive <b>messages.</b>|$|R

50|$|This {{historic}} site caters mostly by urban Kenyans, so the commodification of these particular themes are especially problematic, {{as in this}} case, most of the tourists are actually stakeholders in the historic representation being marketed at this site. To give a critical sense of authenticity, national folklore troupes were formed to tell stories that purposely promote Kenyan nationalism/equality among ethnic groups. There are performances in a modern stadium arena, which creates a juxtaposition of modern and traditional that reflects greater Kenyan society. The representation of several Kenyan ethnic groups and culturally relevant narratives express a politically <b>charged</b> <b>message</b> - Kenyan nationalism. When the tourists that visit the site are the actual stakeholders in the process, culture cannot simply be commodified as a good. The commodification of the Maasai culture is locally managed and produced in this circumstance.|$|R

50|$|Because such auctions {{typically}} require {{very large}} numbers of bidders to be profitable, virtually all instances of unique bid auctions are heavily dependent {{on the use of}} technology, in that they are either run solely using mobile technology (e.g. bidders submit their bids via reverse <b>charge</b> text <b>messages)</b> or they are on-line auction sites, or both.|$|R

2500|$|On November 3, Mike Garafolo {{reported}} on Fox Sports 1 that Incognito {{is alleged to}} have sent Martin threatening and racially <b>charged</b> <b>messages.</b> He also reported that the team and league—rather than the players' association—has been asked to investigate.

50|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made to make ethics computable or at least formal. Whereas Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics are usually not considered to be suitable for an artificial moral agent, it has been studied whether Kant's categorical imperative can be used. However, it has been pointed out that human value is in some aspects very complex. A way to explicitly surmount this difficulty is to receive human values directly from them through some mechanism, for example by learning them. Another approach is to base current ethical considerations on previous similar situations. This is called casuistry and it could be implemented through research on the internet. The consensus from a million past decisions would lead to a new decision that is democracy dependent. This could, however, lead to decisions that reflect biases and unethical behaviors exhibited in society. The negative effects of this approach can be seen in Microsoft's Tay (bot), where the chatterbot learned to repeat racist and sexually <b>charged</b> <b>messages</b> sent by Twitter users.|$|R
5000|$|Along with Office Lady Love Juice, {{the film}} became {{something}} of {{a symbol of the}} rift between the older pinku shitenno ("Four Heavenly Kings" [...] or [...] "Four Devils") group of pink film directors and the younger shichifukujin ("Seven Lucky Gods"). Yūji Tajiris Office Lady Love Juice beat Anarchy in Japansuke for the top spot at the Pink Grand Prix. The older Zeze had been a vocal critic of the younger directors films which avoided the experimentation and politically <b>charged</b> <b>messages</b> which characterize the work of the shitenno. Calling the shichifukujins films [...] "weak" [...] and [...] "light", Zeze engaged in a spat with Tajiri on the stage of the awards ceremony. Jasper Sharp writes that the scuffle was mainly a staged controversy {{for the benefit of the}} audience, as no real personal animosity exists between the two groups of directors. The younger group all gained their first film-making experiences by working on films of the older directors.|$|R
50|$|While it {{may seem}} {{interesting}} {{that one of the}} main Japanese hip-hop groups has released a single about a terrorist attack in the United States, this attention to the United States, especially New York, should come as no surprise. Japanese hip hop draws incredible homage to the United States for its rap culture and its African-American culture. Youth in Japan have even been known to darken their faces, in a style known as burapan, to mimic the look and style of blacks in America. However, as the lyrics of the song show, Japanese hip hop heads are not simply going for the look of black youth, they have a message, and often a politically <b>charged</b> <b>message,</b> that falls into lockstep, (or rhythm) with black youth. King Giddra was not the only hip hop group to criticize the American government for the terrorist attacks: Wyclef Jean, the Gorillaz, and countless other groups have released songs in the wake of 911.|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{argues that}} the Kypris Song somehow represents the quintessential poetics of love. Through its self-reflective and religiously <b>charged</b> <b>message,</b> it reflects Sappho’s anthropological, ritual, and proto-philosophical pronouncement of the leading principle which guides her entire performance production. Like a motto, it bestrides general law and a very personal story of affection, passion and rationality, tackling both overwhelming affliction from external forces and the inner strife to maintain control over her extreme physical symptoms through self-awareness and a pure mind. This paper provides a brief analysis of the structure, texture, and meaning of the Kypris Song. First, it presents some recent reconstructions and addresses their problematic hermeneutical presuppositions in a monodic performance setting. Second, it develops some hypotheses regarding the original choral performance occasion as well as secondary reperformance contexts, and third, it elaborates thoughts on the metapoetic relevance of this song. Sappho’s audience envisages her body pierced and transfixed, and associates her with a heroic existence in an antagonistic relation to Aphrodite. Thus Aphrodite somehow becomes {{a reflection of a}} heroic Sappho. The image of the hero(ine) and Sappho merges through the performance of kleos and love, the medium and essence of Sapphic song...|$|R
