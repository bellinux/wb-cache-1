Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep, reducing {{the ability to}} stay asleep and to achieve restful sleep.

Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways, so there must be careful management of decongestants, asthma controllers, and antihistamines.|$|E
5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> by decreasing welding speed, {{increasing the}} current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects {{can make the}} weld prone to cracking, but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.|$|E
