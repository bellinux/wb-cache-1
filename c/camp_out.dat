The soil resistance was analysed at the site with ground-penetrating radar. Features that appeared to be structural were found, two of which were thought to be the remains of the gas chambers, and the study was allowed to continue.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s Davis hired Ralph Munroe to oversee his Key Biscayne property. Munroe had begun visiting Biscayne Bay in 1877. He soon built a home, the Barnacle, on {{land on the}} {{mainland}} in Coconut Grove that he bought from John Frow, keeper of the Cape Florida Light and Fowey Rocks Light. Munroe engaged in wrecking in the waters around Key Biscayne, built sailboats, worked as a pilot for the Cape Florida Channel and opened a pineapple cannery, to which Davis sent his pineapples. Before mail service to the Miami area improved, Munroe would <b>camp</b> <b>out</b> on Key Biscayne every Tuesday evening {{so that he could}} sail out {{to the edge of the}} Gulf Stream early Wednesday morning to retrieve a package of newspapers and magazines dropped for him in waterproof pouches by a passing steamship. Munroe was also one of the founding members of the Biscayne Bay Yacht Club.|$|E

5|$|Leonard Nimoy {{begins the}} episode hosting {{a show about}} alien {{encounter}}s. He talks about an encounter in a town called Springfield. At Moe's on a Friday night, a drunk Homer is forced to walk home, but takes a wrong path and {{ends up in the}} woods. In a clearing, he sees a glowing, thin-boned alien. Homer panics and runs home screaming. The rest of the family do not believe Homer's story and his attempts to report the alien sighting to police are dismissed. Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the FBI hear of the sighting and go to investigate. After receiving no results from their psychological tests of him, Homer fails to provide any proof that he actually saw an alien. Homer is ridiculed by most of the neighborhood; even Marge refuses to believe in his claims, but Bart admits he believes Homer. The next Friday night, the pair <b>camp</b> <b>out</b> in the forest. The alien arrives and promises peace, but Homer scares it away when he accidentally steps on their camp fire and screams in pain. Fortunately, Bart captures the entire incident on tape.|$|E

From a description provided by our source, I had easily identified the building in question, which was located in Baghdad's downtown Aadamiyah section. The ten crates of missile parts were stashed in a basement of the Baghdad headquarters of Saddam's own Ba'ath party. If we could achieve surprise and surround the site before the Iraqis could evacuate the crates, we would obtain the ultimate catch-22 situation: let us inside as promised and we would find the prohibited material; bar our entry and violate the Kofi Annan compromise, {{and in the process}} invite a devastating air strike by the United States.

25|$|Chemotaxis {{is defined}} as a passage of an {{organism}} toward or away from a chemical stimulus along a chemical concentration gradient. Certain organisms demonstrate chemotaxis when they move toward a supply of nutrients. In D. discoideum, the amoeba secretes the signal, <b>cAMP,</b> <b>out</b> of the cell, attracting other amoebae to migrate toward the source. Every amoeba moves toward a central amoeba, the one dispensing the greatest amount of cAMP secretions. The secretion of the cAMP is then exhibited by all amoebae and is a call for them to begin aggregation. These chemical emissions and amoeba movement occur every six minutes. The amoebae move toward the concentration gradient for 60 seconds and stop until the next secretion is sent out. This behavior of individual cells tends to cause oscillations in a group of cells, and chemical waves of varying cAMP concentration propagate through the group in spirals.|$|E
25|$|Bella annoys Edward with {{questions}} about how he saved her life. She hears that Edward {{and his family are}} vampires who drink animal blood. She is told legends of the local Quilyeute people by a friend Jacob Black who she met during a <b>camp</b> <b>out.</b> Disturbed by recurring nightmares, Bella researches about vampires. To her dismay, she then realizes that Edward hadn't come to school on the blood typing day because he is a vampire; she compares the characteristics of the vampires in mythology to the Cullens, and finds many similarities. Convinced he's a vampire, she finds herself in the state of bewilderment. Bella is saved by Edward again in Port Angeles when she is almost attacked. Driving a silver Volvo, Edward takes Bella to dinner and home. As they drive, she tells him of the stories that he is a vampire. Edward says he tried to stay away, finding her scent too desirable. Over time, Edward and Bella fall in love.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Poole, a {{nineteenth century}} writer, wrote that all 2024 {{passengers}} boarded nine ships in June 1825, with everything they owned, from Cork across the Atlantic Ocean to Quebec City. The journey took 30 days {{to cross the}} Atlantic and on board the ship they were provided with bunks and food rations. Hard tack or ship biscuits {{were one of the}} many foods that were made to provide energy for the passengers. Hard tack was very easy to make and could be stored for months without spoiling. After the settlers landed in Quebec City they traveled further down the St-Lawrence River eventually reaching Lachine where they boarded a bateau. Heading west to Kingston and ultimately to Kingston and Cobourg. They camped in tents in Cobourg for several weeks until Peter Robinson joined them to lead them up to their final destination. The long voyage across the ocean was enough to weaken the emigrants but having to <b>camp</b> <b>out</b> in tents in the mid-summer heat brought on several other complications. Nearly all of the settlers experienced fever and ague, and several perished from it. Even faced with these hardships they forged ahead and put their trust in Peter Robinson, the man leading them to their settlement in Peterborough.|$|E
