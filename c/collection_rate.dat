The capacity-building aspect of the Peruvian model includes strengthening the operation and maintenance requirements of the systems, and improvement of financial performance through increased volumetric metering, water tariff structure, and <b>collection</b> <b>rate.</b> Improving financial performance of the WUBs is linked to increasing farm incomes and therefore farmers' capacity to contribute to O costs as well as irrigation improvement investments.|$|E

25|$|When the Soviet Union {{collapsed}} and Georgia became independent in 1991, its {{water supply and}} sanitation infrastructure was in bad shape. Maintenance had been neglected for many years and service quality was poor, with intermittent supply and often poor drinking water quality. After independence there was no clear government commitment to address the deficiencies in {{water supply and sanitation}} and service quality deteriorated even further. For example, operation of the wastewater treatment plant of the capital Tbilisi was stopped because the city was unable to afford to pay for its electricity bill after electricity tariffs had been increased. In 2003 a report by the OECD found that the Georgian urban water and sanitation sector was seriously under-financed, given its long neglect. The report noted that the <b>collection</b> <b>rate</b> of water bills was 70% for businesses and only 34% for households. The report recommended increasing collection efficiency and to double the water and sewer tariff in areas outside the capital until they reached the highest affordable level. This was defined as 95% of households spending less than 2.5% of their income on their water and sewer bill. The OECD recommended to leave the tariff in Tbilisi unchanged, because it had already reached the limit of affordability. Furthermore, the government should increase its spending for water supply and sanitation, reform the sector's structure and strengthen human and institutional capacities.|$|E

A robust software for determination was also developed.

500|$|Space-based {{solar power}} (SBSP) {{is the concept}} of {{collecting}} solar power in space (using an [...] "SPS", that is, a [...] "solar-power satellite" [...] or a [...] "satellite power system") for use on Earth. It has been in research since the early 1970s. SBSP would differ from current solar collection methods in that the means used to collect energy would reside on an orbiting satellite instead of on Earth's surface. Some projected benefits of such a system are a higher <b>collection</b> <b>rate</b> and a longer collection period {{due to the lack of}} a diffusing atmosphere and night time in space.|$|E

2500|$|Space-based {{solar power}} (SBSP) {{is the concept}} of {{collecting}} solar power in outer space and distributing it to Earth. Potential advantages of collecting solar energy in space include a higher <b>collection</b> <b>rate</b> and a longer collection period {{due to the lack of}} a diffusing atmosphere, and the possibility of placing a solar collector in an orbiting location where there is no night. A considerable fraction of incoming solar energy (55–60%) is lost on its way through the Earth's atmosphere by the effects of reflection and absorption. Space-based solar power systems convert sunlight to microwaves outside the atmosphere, avoiding these losses, and the downtime due to the Earth's rotation, but at great cost due to the expense of launching material into orbit. SBSP is considered a form of sustainable or green energy, renewable energy, and is occasionally considered among climate engineering proposals. [...] It is attractive to those seeking large-scale solutions to anthropogenic climate change or fossil fuel depletion (such as peak oil).|$|E
40|$|The {{recovery}} and utilization of recovered paper have increased over past decades {{all over the}} world due to economic, environmental, and social issues. However, {{it is well known that}} an extended recovered paper collection is detrimental to its quality, either by the exploitation of lower quality sources such as households, or the spreading of commingled systems instead of selective collection systems. The influence of these two factors was assessed by analyzing the quality of different recovered paper grades used as raw material in a mill located in Madrid (Spain) producing newsprint and light weight coated paper from recovered paper. Part 1 of the paper deals with the impact of increased <b>collection</b> <b>rates</b> on the quality of recovered paper and Part 2 with the use of commingled collection systems. Results of Part 1 show that increased <b>collection</b> <b>rates</b> have a large impact on the quality of the recovered paper. The quality, measured as total unusable material and moisture contents, had deteriorated very rapidly in only four years (2005 - 2008) as a consequence of increased <b>collection</b> <b>rates.</b> <b>Collection</b> <b>rates</b> increased in Spain from 58. 5 % to 68. 6 % during this period, resulting in more than 50 % increase of total unusable material and 25 % of moisture content. The downgrading of the quality of recovered paper is one of the major threats for extending the current limits of paper recycling. Therefore, future challenge is to increase its availability but maintaining its quality...|$|R

2500|$|Cost {{recovery}} varies between utilities. The <b>collection</b> <b>rate</b> (i.e. {{the shares}} of bills actually paid) in Beirut-Mount Lebanon has been consistent at almost 90%, so that the utility had accumulated over US$170 million as cash surplus in 2010. However, as of 2010 it {{was estimated to be}} only 62%. In the three other Regional Water Establishments collection rates are lower at 58% in the North, 52% in the South and only 18% in the Bekaa. In the three Establishments not even operating costs are recovered. The Government often steps in to pay for operating expenses in addition to financing investments in water infrastructure. Cost recovery is lowest for the Bekaa water company. According to a World Bank report, [...] "there appears to be an informal understanding between water companies and households: many households don’t receive their water allotment, and the water companies often don’t pressure households to pay their bills." [...] Given the current conditions and alternatives, households have stated in surveys that they are reluctant to pay more for [...] better public [...] service. Even where meters have been installed, there is no volumetric tariff. Flat fees are charged regardless of the existence of the meters. There thus is no financial incentive to save water. There is also no wastewater tariff.|$|E
