Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 49 - 50). This study {{attempts to}} find out the problems of factoring in Turkey and come up with possible solutions. Factoring is introduced briefly by stating its functions, history and development in the world and Turkey. In addition, factoring is compared with Letter of Credit, Open Account, <b>Cash</b> <b>Against</b> <b>Documents,</b> Credit Insurance, Discount on Draft and Conveyance Credit. Moreover the problems of factoring in Turkey are stated and possible solutions are suggested. In this study it is found that factoring has superiority over other alternatives which Turkish firms prefer to use in their sales transactions. The study has also revealed that factoring is not regulated completely by the separate laws in Turkey. Finally, it is concluded that factoring is a financing technique that helps a lot in the development of trade of Turkey both in domestic and foreign markets. Expansion of factoring is inevitable which is fundamentally {{a good thing for the}} Turkish economy and for the factoring industry. Government and factoring firms should do everything to encourage that growth. Public acceptance of factoring is due to professional approach of factors. Caneri, OğuzM. S...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAt {{the present}} day, we rapidly {{live in an}} {{information}} age. Globalisation has removed the borders and shortened the distances between the countries. Some reasons such as information speed, shortening of distances and competition have brought innovative solutions in international business transactions. If we look generally to innovative developments in international business life, the most important examples are observed at payment and delivery terms. Recently {{with the impact of}} the revision made in 2010 there were radical changes at INCOTERMS. On the other hand a new form of payment BPO has been suggested to importers and exporters which hosts speed, technology and trust factors inside. One of the most important issues in international business transaction is payment. Exporter and importer pay similar attention to this subject and both of them wonder about how and when the payment will be done. Thus far, with effect of competition, speed and technology traditional payment terms such as cash, <b>cash</b> <b>against</b> <b>documents</b> and letter of credit remained inadequate, unreliable and expensive. In order to meet these needs, developing new payment method BPO has taken place in international business since 2013. In this study, payment terms in international business were examined. On the other hand, from the moment it entered into force in 2013, the new payment term BPO how often used, and previously which payment terms used instead of BPO were analysed. However, BPO and other payment terms are compared with each other and BPO's effects on Turkish international business life are also determined...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Nestlé is World‟s largest health, nutrition and wellness company founded by the Henri Nestlé. Nestlé Bangladesh Limited started its commercial operation in 1994. Nestlé Bangladesh established its factory in Sreepur 55 km north of Dhaka. The factory produces the instant noodles and cereals and repacks milks, soups, beverages and infant nutrition products.

The whole import procedure of raw material is done by Supply chain and Treasury Department. Supply chain place their requirement of raw material to respective suppliers through purchase order. Once the order is confirmed they request treasury department to open up a Letter of Credit or CAD (<b>Cash</b> <b>against</b> <b>Documents),</b> L/C is the most popular international trade payment method in Bangladesh as well as in Nestlé Bangladesh, which covers the issues like potential risk that the parties in international trade namely the importers and exporters wish to face or share between them. There are different parties involved in opening a Letter of credit and it also requires authorized papers to submit to their Authorized LC opening bank and they will facilitate NBL and give guarantee to the respective suppliers about the payment procedure. Once NBL opened the LC supplier get to know through their bank and they shipped the goods to the destined location.

These fragilities materialized after Lehman Brothers’ collapse and were exacerbated by the ECB's collateral policies. The European sovereign debt crisis shows that governments, just like private asset issuers, can rapidly become vulnerable to repo pro-cyclicality and collateral crises...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{the bank}} can use reserve capital as {{variation}} margin. Note that the marginal {{cost of capital}} for using capital as a funding source for variation margin is nil, because when one posts <b>cash</b> <b>against</b> variation margin, the valuation of the collateralized hedge is reset to zero and the total capital amount does not change. If, instead, the bank were to post capital as initial margin, then the bank would record a “margin receivable” entry on its balance sheet, which however cannot contribute to capital since this asset is too illiquid and impossible to unwind without unwinding all underlying derivatives. Hence, capital can only be used as VM, while it seems that IM must be borrowed entirely.|$|R

The evidence shows that the debt ratio and the payout cash dividend ratio in the internationalized electronic firms are lower than those in domestic electronic firms. Due to the uniqueness and the high profit ability of the internationalized electronic firms in the US, they have more earnings and inside capital so that the debt ratio is lower. Also, the internationalized electronic industries in the US have higher internationalization level with higher system risk level but their payout cash dividend ratio is less in {{that they tend to}} keep the <b>cash</b> <b>against</b> any incident. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{dividend}} futures existed, {{an investor}} {{who wanted a}} similar exposure did so by trading a dividend swap. Dividend swaps are the over-the-counter version of dividend futures. They allow two parties to agree to swap in the future a pre-defined amount of <b>cash</b> <b>against</b> the amount of dividends paid by the underlying stock, basket or equity index.Created in the early 2000s, dividend Swaps became very popular because they allowed equity holders to [...] "sell" [...] their future dividends in advance and hence hedge their future dividend stream. The biggest players were investment banks looking to cover their future dividend exposure from derivatives positions they had on their books.The first dividend future was listed in June 2008 by the derivatives exchange Eurex, a derivatives exchange, on the Euro Stoxx 50 dividends, and since then many new dividend futures were created on various exchanges.|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between uncertainty avoidance, multinationality and firm cash holdings. We develop several hypotheses from corporate finance and multinational firm theory, positing that cultural factors as well firm multinationality influence corporate cash holdings. In particular, firms in countries with high uncertainty avoidance hold more cash as a way to hedge against undesired states of nature. At the same time, firm multinationality moderates the effects culture has on the firm's holdings of liquid assets. Based on a large panel of firms in fifty countries, we present evidence consistent with these hypotheses. Firms in countries with high levels of uncertainty avoidance tend to hold more <b>cash.</b> <b>Against</b> commonly held views in cash management, the degree of multinationality of the firm is positively correlated with holdings of cash. At the same time, the effect of national culture on firm's cash holdings is lower for multinationals. These results are economically significant.

40|$|The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) {{with its}} partner the Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) have been {{fiercely}} competing {{to create a}} viable and liquid sour oil futures contract {{that could serve as}} a pricing benchmark and as a mechanism for improved risk management. In part, this fierce competition reflects a battle between two very different approaches to oil trading and pricing. While ICE’s Middle East sour crude futures contract (launched on 21 May) is a purely financial instrument settled in <b>cash</b> <b>against</b> a Platts Dubai assessment, DME’s Oman futures contract (launched on 1 June) allows settlement against physical delivery of Oman crude oil. In the first month of trading, DME announced that a total of 4000 Oman futures contracts would be going for physical delivery in August.

5000|$|The basic {{building}} blocks for all derivative contracts are futures and swaps contracts. In energy markets, these are traded in New York NYMEX, in Tokyo TOCOM and online through the IntercontinentalExchange. A future is a contract to deliver or receive oil (in {{the case of an}} oil future) at a defined point in the future. The price is agreed on the date the deal/agreement/bargain is struck together with volume, duration, and contract index. The price for the futures contract at the date of delivery (contract expiry date) may be different. At the expiry date, depending upon the contract specification the [...] "futures" [...] owner may either deliver/receive a physical amount of oil (extremely rare), they may settle in <b>cash</b> <b>against</b> an expiration price set by the exchange, or they may close out the contract prior to expiry and pay or receive the difference in the two prices.
