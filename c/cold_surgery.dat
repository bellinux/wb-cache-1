40|$|The {{strategy}} of organ preservation by applying chemoradiotherapy {{in the treatment}} of laryngeal carcinoma, which has been extensively used since 1990 s, is now being reviewed regarding its further justification. Despite good results in other localization of head and neck cancer, it has not met the expectations in case of laryngeal cancer. One explanation is the lower participation of human papillomavirus type 16 in the etiology of laryngeal cancer. A lot of developing countries base their concept on primary surgery with subsequent radiotherapy, because the cost of operations for cancer of the larynx is much lower than in developed countries. Endoscopic surgery of T 1 cancers is feasible in all environments using <b>cold</b> <b>surgery</b> thanks to modern management of anesthesia with the possibility of local application of adrenaline. Its price is € 481. 46, and if it is performed through laryngofissure, the price is € 785. 46. The introduction of lasers into the treatment would justify the initial investment and extend indications, and the surgery of T 1 and T 2 cancers with laser application should be the standard practice in all countries and regions dealing with laryngeal pathology. T 2 and some T 3 cancers can be treated by conservation surgery of the larynx. Most of T 3 and T 4 cancers are indications for total laryngectomy or near-total laryngectomy in selected cases. If it is the primary surgery, wound healing is good and complications are rare. This greatly reduces the cost of operation, which is € 1910. 15. Surgery after radiotherapy, particularly after chemoradiotherapy, may result in complications that significantly prolong the treatment and increase its costs. Thus, the biological nature of laryngeal cancer and its specificity make this approach to the treatment of cancer available in all regions of the world...|$|E
40|$|To {{compare the}} results of LASER and <b>cold</b> knife <b>surgery</b> for the {{treatment}} of vallecular cysts in adults. Material & Methods: It was an retrospective study of 24 consecutive patients who underwent LASER and <b>cold</b> knife <b>surgery</b> for vallecular cysts in university affiliated teaching hospital. Results: Three patients did not have adequate follow up & hence were excluded from the study. Patients were assessed in follow up for any recurrences. Out of 21 patients, sixteen were male and five were females. Age ranged from 14 – 56 years and duration of symptoms was 1 – 14 months. All the patients revealed a cyst in the vallecula on indirect laryngoscopic examination and plain X- ray soft tissue neck lateral view. CT scan was done in two cases only. Tracheostomy was done in three patients for airway management (LASER – 1,Cold Knife– 2). Fifteen patients underwent LASER surgery where as six patients underwent <b>cold</b> knife <b>surgery.</b> Lingual surface of epiglottis was the most common site of origin (71 %). Follow up ranged from 6 months to 48 months. Two recurrences were noted in <b>cold</b> knife <b>surgery</b> group, whereas, no recurrence was noted in patients undergoing LASER surgery.

40|$|Actuality: A {{thorough}} sanation of the nasopharynx {{is essential}} for successful treatment of the exudative otitis media (EOM). The literature describes in detail {{the state of the}} nasopharynx after different types of adenoidectomy. The classifications of the location of the remnants of lymphoid tissue and the extent of scarring in the nasopharynx are given. The subject of this work is to trace the relationship of postoperative nasopharyngeal changes with recurrent EOM. Objective: To study the immediate and long-term results of different methods of surgical treatment of hypertrophy of the nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissue in children with exudative otitis media. Materials and Methods: This paper presents information on the results of treatment of 62 children of 5 – 7 years suffering from exudative otitis media. Observations were carried out in two groups of patients. The first group included 28 children previously undergone adenoidectomy, with the signs of recurrent exudative otitis. The second group included 34 children with exudative otitis previously untreated surgically. The task of the investigation is to study the effectiveness of endonasal and extranasal methods of surgical removal of nasopharengeal lymphoid tissue with a minimum probability of scar obliteration of the mouth of the Eustachian tube. Results and discussion: The priority method in nasopharengeal surgery in children is extranasal access with shaver technology in conjunction with <b>cold</b> plasma <b>surgery.</b> The using of these methods gives a clear visualization of the operating field under conditions of moderately bleeding wound. On the other hand, endonasal approach is associated with traumatization of the nasal mucosa with incomplete volume visualization of the surgical field. This combination can result in a longer healing of the surgical wound, the formation of adhesions of the nasal cavity and scarring in the nasopharynx. Complete visualization of the operating field significantly affects the long-term results of EOM treatment in childhood. Conclusions: The use of <b>cold</b> plasma <b>surgery</b> combined with shaver gives the possibility to achieve in the long term a stable cure in 93...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} a systematic {{review of the}} literature to evaluate treatment of oral leukoplakia with the carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser. A comprehensive search of studies published between 1981 and 2015 and listed in the PubMed (National Library of Medicine, NCBI) database yielded 378 articles which were screened in detail. Rele- vant studies were selected according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 33 articles met the final inclusion criteria and were analysed in detail in accordance with the PRISMA-P statement. These full-text papers were classified as synopses (n 1 ⁄ 4 7), recurrence and malignant trans- formation studies (n 1 ⁄ 4 17), comparative studies between CO 2 laser and <b>cold</b> knife <b>surgery</b> (n 1 ⁄ 4 3) and studies evaluating the efficacy of CO 2, Nd:YAG and KTP lasers. According to the literature the CO 2 laser is the workhorse of oral leukoplakia treatment due to its effectiveness and low associated morbidity. However, randomized clinical trials are needed to compare CO 2 laser with other lasers. The results of our systematic review showed that there is no consensus regarding the factors involved in higher recurrence and malignization rates, so further studies are needed...|$|R
40|$|From {{a sample}} of 19, 000 {{treatment}} episodes at 183 of the 193 independent hospitals with operating facilities in England and Wales that were open during 1986 {{it is estimated that}} 404, 000 inpatients were treated in 1986 (an increase of 48 % since 1981) and 99, 000 day cases (an increase of 112 %). It was found that the procedure most commonly performed was abortion, though this made up only 19 % of the total caseload in 1986 compared with 30 % in 1981, otherwise the case mix in 1986 was similar to that in 1981. Fewer patients came from overseas in 1986 than in 1981, but the distribution by age and sex remained the same, with three quarters of the patients aged between 15 and 65. The estimated bed occupancy in the independent hospitals in 1986 was less than 60 % nationally and only 52 % in the Thames regions. It is concluded that in these five years the nature of the independent hospital sector changed little, and in 1986 the activity still consisted largely of routine <b>cold</b> elective <b>surgery</b> for people of working age, and the regional differences in admission rates to independent hospitals were nearly as great as in 1981...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveSimultaneous {{inhibition}} of the cardiac equilibrative-p-nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) –sensitive (es) type of the equilibrative nucleoside transport 1 (ENT 1) nucleoside transporter, with NBMPR, and adenosine deaminase, with erythro- 9 -[2 -hydroxy- 3 -nonyl]adenine (EHNA), prevents release of myocardial purines and attenuates myocardial stunning and fibrillation in canine models of warm ischemia and reperfusion. It {{is not known}} whether prolonged administration of hypothermic cardioplegia influences purine release and EHNA/NBMPR-mediated cardioprotection in acutely ischemic hearts. MethodsAnesthetized dogs (n =  46), which underwent normothermic aortic crossclamping for 20 minutes on-pump, were divided to determine (1) purine release with induction of intermittent antegrade or continuous retrograde hypothermic cardioplegia and reperfusion, (2) the effects of postischemic treatment with 100 μM EHNA and 25 μM NBMPR on purine release and global functional recovery, and (3) whether a hot shot and reperfusion with EHNA/NBMPR inhibits purine release and attenuates ventricular dysfunction of ischemic hearts. Myocardial biopsies and coronary sinus effluents were obtained and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. ResultsWarm ischemia depleted myocardial adenosine triphosphate and elevated purines (ie, inosine > adenosine) as markers of ischemia. Induction of intermittent antegrade or continuous retrograde hypothermic (4 °C) cardioplegia releases purines until the heart becomes cold (90 % of purines in coronary sinus effluent. Reperfusion with EHNA/NBMPR abolished ventricular dysfunction in acutely ischemic hearts with and without a hot shot and hypothermic cardioplegic arrest. ConclusionsInduction of hypothermic cardioplegia releases purines from ischemic hearts until they become cold, whereas reperfusion induces massive purine release and myocardial stunning.

40|$|Background: The current {{standard}} {{recommendation is}} to avoid surgical interventions in patients taking oral isotretinoin. However, this recommendation has been questioned in several recent publications. Aim: To document the safety of cosmetic and surgical interventions, among patients receiving or recently received oral isotretinoin. Materials and Methods: Association of Cutaneous Surgeons, India, in May 2012, initiated this study, at 11 centers {{in different parts of}} India. The data of 183 cases were collected monthly, from June 2012 to May 2013. Of these 61 patients had stopped oral isotretinoin before surgery and 122 were concomitantly taking oral isotretinoin during the study period. In these 183 patients, a total of 504 interventions were performed. These included[1] 246 sessions of chemical peels such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, trichloroacetic acid, and combination peels;[2] 158 sessions of lasers such as ablative fractional laser resurfacing with erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet and CO 2, conventional full face CO 2 laser resurfacing, laser-assisted hair reduction with long-pulsed neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet, diode laser, and LASIK surgery;[3] 27 sessions of <b>cold</b> steel <b>surgeries</b> such as microneedling, skin biopsy, subcision, punch elevation of scars, excision of skin lesion, and wisdom tooth extraction;[4] 1 session of electrosurgery. Results: No significant side effects were noted in most patients. 2 cases of keloid were documented which amounted to 0. 4 % of side effects in 504 interventions, with a significant P value of 0. 000. Reversible transient side effects were erythema in 10 interventions and hyperpigmentation in 15. Conclusion: The study showed that performing dermatosurgical and laser procedures in patients receiving or recently received isotretinoin is safe, and the current guidelines of avoiding dermatosurgical and laser interventions in such patients taking isotretinoin need to be revised...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{conventional}} surgery with carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser in patients with oral leukoplakia, and to evaluate the postoperative pain and swelling. Study design: A total of 48 patients (27 males and 21 females) with a mean age of 53. 7 ± 11. 7 years and diagnosed with oral leukoplakia were randomly assigned to receive treatment either with conventional <b>surgery</b> using a <b>cold</b> knife or with a CO 2 laser technique. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to score pain and swelling at different postoperative time points. Results: Pain and swelling reported by the patients was greater with the conventional cold knife than with the CO 2 laser, statistically significant differences for pain and swelling were observed between the two techniques during the first three days after surgery. Followed by a gradual decrease over one week. In neither group was granuloma formation observed, and none of the patients showed malignant transformation during the period of follow-up. Conclusions: The CO 2 laser causes only minimal pain and swelling, thus suggesting that it may be an alternative method to conventional surgery in treating patients with oral leukoplakia.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} cardiac performance following {{coronary artery}} surgery using two different techniques of cardioplegia. DESIGN: Randomized prospective study. SETTING: Adult cardiothoracic {{intensive care unit}} in a university hospital. STUDY POPULATION: Thirty patients undergoing isolated coronary surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive either intermittent antegrade warm blood cardioplegia with normothermic bypass (group 1) or combined antegrade and retrograde cold crystalloid cardioplegia with hypothermic bypass (group 2). Hemodynamic evaluation included conventional measurements from a pulmonary artery catheter and data obtained by thermal dye dilution utilizing an arterial thermistor-tipped fiberoptic catheter. RESULTS: The only major difference between groups was a significantly higher right atrial pressure in group 2, from 4 h to 24 h after surgery (8. 8 +/- 2. 6 vs. 11. 8 +/- 3. 2 mmHg at 4 h and 11 +/- 3. 1 vs. 8. 5 +/- 1. 8 mmHg at 24 h, P = 0. 04). After cold cardioplegia {{a significant increase in}} right atrial pressure was observed (7. 5 +/- 3. 1 before surgery vs. 11. 4 +/- 3 mmHg at 8 h, P = 0. 003) whereas right ventricular end diastolic volume index did not increase significantly, suggesting impaired right ventricular diastolic compliance in this group. CONCLUSIONS: Until 24 h after <b>surgery</b> <b>cold</b> cardioplegia is associated with impaired right ventricular filling, which seems better preserved by intermittent antegrade warm blood cardioplegia. End-diastolic volume measurement with the double-indicator technique allows differentiation between systolic and diastolic dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} little {{economic}} analysis of the private health care industry in Britain {{and as a result}} much of the policy debate about its role has been ill-informed and based on rhetoric. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the market for private health care and the demand for private insurance in Britain. It is shown that the market is highly specialised, providing care for non-emergency (mostly surgical) cases. Care is provided in NHS pay beds and just over 10, 000 private beds, the majority of which are owned by for-profit organisations. The sector is very specialised, providing predominantly <b>cold</b> elective <b>surgery</b> and whilst its turnover is small relative to the NHS, in relation to the particular submarket in which it operates its role is very significant, with over 1 in 6 cold elective procedures in England being provided in the private sector. Geographical inequalities in this provision mean that some London Regions now have nearly one third of such procedures carried out privately. The finance for such care comes from predominantly non-profit making (private) insurers. Over 5 million people are covered by private health care insurance and in 1987 over £ 580 million was paid out in benefits. If private payments in cash are added to this figure, total private health expenditure in 1987 was of the order of £ 750 million. The insurers have sought to control the costs, arguing that market growth is dependent on premia stability and that increases in stability will reduce coverage. However, the implied price elasticity (i. e. the implication that coverage is reduced significantly by price increases) has not been estimated until now. In this paper the authors use available date to provide estimates of the short (impact) and long run price elasticity of - 0. 6 and - 2 / 55 respectively. The low value for the estimate of the short run elasticity implies that if providers raised their charges aggressively and these costs were passed on in high premia, market demand would decline by a relatively small amount. Elsewhere Propper and Eastwood (1988) have argued that private buyers of insurance tend to be conservative in adjusting to market changes. This behaviour is consistent with these elasticity estimates. The tentative conclusion from this paper, based on the short run elasticity estimate of - 0. 6, is that providers could be aggressive price makers with little risk of losing market share. This result merits further investigation as the price elasticity value may vary in different submarkets (for example, it may be higher in the corporate sector). If data were made available, such questions could be examined. Further, without better data the discussion of the efficiency of the private sector will remain vague and policy will be based on the images rather than the reality of the market’s operations. private health, insurance, market...|$|R

Results: The mean dose of ephedrine required was (12. 5  ±  7. 5  mg).

40|$|Incisional, {{chest and}} sternal pain is {{prevalent}} in patients after cardiac surgery. If pain is not properly managed it may prevent patients from performing {{activities such as}} deep breathing and coughing (DB & C) which are important for preventing postoperative respiratory complications. There is a scarcity of research about the nonpharmacologic modalities for treating post cardiac incisional and sternal pain. Of these modalities, cold therapy is a strategy {{that has been used}} effectively over many decades {{in a number of areas}} including orthopedic surgery. The beneficial effects of cold therapy for pain management have been widely documented and the side effects are minimal, yet its use is limited in post-surgical cardiac patients. Nurses can have an active role in relieving patients' surgical pain with cold therapy. Presently, there are no studies in the literature that specifically address cold therapy for sternotomy pain management following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate the effects of cold therapy on pain associated with DB & C post cardiac surgery; (2) to identify sensations from the patients' perspective when cold in the form of a gel pack is applied to the median sternotomy chest incision before DB & C; (3) to identify patients' preferences for gel or no gel pack application. A crossover research design was utilized and each patient served as their own control. Participants underwent four sessions of DB & C every two hours on postoperative day two. Two sessions were preceded by cold application and two sessions were without cold application. At the end of the four sessions of DB & C, patients were asked about their preferences for gel or no gel pack application. Pain scores associated with DB & C were significantly decreased with the application of cold therapy (F= 28. 69, p<. 001). Most participants preferred using the gel pack before performing the DB & C exercises (n= 22; 69 %) and there were 2 (6 %) participants who preferred DB & C without the gel pack, the other participants (n= 8) had no preference. The sensations experienced were similar among all participants, most described coolness (n= 9; 28 %) or cold (n= 23, 72 %). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that cold therapy is useful for managing patients' pain associated with DB & C following CABO <b>surgery.</b> <b>Cold</b> therapy is low risk, low cost and can be easily integrated into nursing practice since cold packs are easily accessible in most hospitals. With nurses' initial supervision, cold therapy is a safe and effective pain management modality that gives patients an active role in pain management. Further research is recommended on the application of other cold modalities such as the use of ice chips as the cold source before DB & C as well as performing the intervention earlier after the surgery on postoperative day one...|$|R
