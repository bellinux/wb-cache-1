Various information resources like domain specific information systems, technical experts, and <b>customer's</b> <b>product</b> <b>requirements</b> contribute both the necessary {{data and the}} valuation background for the optimal design.

They are all based on the assumption that for coping with high speed and high change, traditional management techniques are inadequate. Effectively, the new methodologies are based on a different value system than the old ones. A value system is a system of beliefs about what constitutes the fundamental aspects of software development: developers, <b>customers,</b> markets, <b>products,</b> <b>requirements,</b> etc. This paper presents a simple model of value systems and compares the value systems of two exemplary new development methodologies, Adaptive Software Development (ASD) and Extreme Programming (XP).

The former are elicited from customers while the latter are brought forth by the developing organization. These are preferably kept separated to preserve the different perspectives. The interrelationships should however be identified and maintained to enable well-founded decisions. Unfortunately, the current manual linkage is cumbersome, time-consuming, and error-prone. This paper presents a pragmatic linguistic engineering approach to how statistical natural language processing {{may be used to}} support the manual linkage between <b>customer</b> wishes and <b>product</b> <b>requirements</b> by suggesting potential links.

30|$|Kano model, {{developed}} by Professor Noriaki Kano, identifies and categorizes customer requirements or attributes as must-be, one-dimensional, attractive, indifferent and reverse requirements (or features). An {{understanding of these}} product quality attributes is beneficial to {{improving the quality of}} products and in the developments of products (Zhu et al. 2010). For example, Lee et al. (2015) discovered that Web portal preferences were driven by attractive, must-be, and one-dimensional qualities and Hussain et al. (2015) found that the requirements for an e-Ebola awareness Web portal are of attractive and one-dimensional types. This knowledge serves as a precursor to the design and development of quality products (Hussain et al. 2015). Requirements engineers need feedback from users on planned system features (Proynova and Paech 2013). These feedbacks are captured in a Kano survey (Hussain et al. 2015). The feedbacks are obtained before users have experience with the software product (Proynova and Paech 2013). Many researchers have applied Kano model to identify customer needs and how product attributes or features affects customer satisfaction (Gupta and Srivastava 2011). Kano model helps in identifying and distinguishing <b>product</b> <b>requirements</b> or features that have great influence on the satisfaction of <b>customers.</b> Classifying <b>product</b> <b>requirements</b> into must-be, attractive, one-dimensional, indifferent and reverse can be employed to focus on priorities for product development; for instance, it is not very useful to invest in improving must-be requirements that are already at the level of satisfaction, however, it is better to improve attractive and/or one-dimensional requirements, since they have a greater influence or impact on the perceived product quality and resultantly on the customers’ satisfaction level (Gupta and Srivastava 2011). However, Kano model’s classification of requirements is qualitative in nature and has little or no use in quantitative evaluation (Hussain et al. 2015).|$|R

In order to validate the modifications, regression testing has to be performed again and again.

In the proposed work, variable and constraints have been reused from the previous version of the web application. These constraints and variable that has been reused provides less effort and time for the modification of test cases. The test cases can be generated only for the modifications on the basis of reusable constraints and variables. The testing process involves an algorithm that is used to compute the reusable constraints and variables for processing of the web application. In addition to it, prioritization of the test cases has been done on the basis of different coverage area of the web application...|$|R

Currently APN is using a batch processing system where product is transformed into finished goods dependent on <b>customer</b> <b>requirements.</b> <b>Product</b> is also made to stock, or finished goods inventory to accommodate customers requiring quick deliveries.

There has been a lack of a robust requirements management system to help designers to get the right requirements in the right time. The main objective of this thesis is to develop ontology for systematic gathering of <b>product</b> <b>requirements.</b> The starting point of this thesis is the environment-based design theory by Zeng (Zeng, 2004), where <b>product</b> <b>requirements</b> are attributed to the conflicts in product environment.

The practice of FMEA is diversified and different approaches are proposed by different organizations and researchers from one application to another. Yet, the question is how to systematically utilize the features of FMEA along with the design process. This thesis aims to integrate different types of FMEA in the design process, which is considered as the mapping between <b>customer</b> <b>requirements,</b> <b>product</b> functions, and design components. These three design elements are the foundation of the integration model proposed in this thesis. The objective of this thesis is to develop an integration approach of FMEA in the design process. Particularly, an integration framework is developed to integrate FMEA and design process. Then, a step-by-step FMEA-facilitated design process is proposed to apply FMEA along with the design process. In the end, a detailed case study of a smartphone model is conducted to demonstrate and verify the proposed methodology. The expectedly benefits of the proposed methodology are the consistency of failure analysis information, and the utilization of the failure analysis information from one stage to the later stages of the design process. ...|$|R

Previous studies focused on the automatic identification of opinion i. e. classifying reviews into positive, negative and neutral only. However, for some applications like flame detection or information analysis, recognizing opinion only might not be sufficient. Thus, identifying strength of opinion is considered as one of the propounded problems from the early days. In this paper we proposed a Fuzzy Semantic Classifier (FSC) to classify <b>customer</b> <b>product</b> reviews at granularity levels such as very strong, strong, moderate, weak and very weak positive and negative class. We used fuzzy logic because it introduces the notion of linguistic variable to overcome the uncertainly of natural language.
