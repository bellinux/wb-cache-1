40|$|The {{possibility}} of inadvertent exposure of gonadal tissue to gene therapy vectors has raised safety concerns about germline infection. We show {{here that the}} receptor for coxsackie B viruses and adenoviruses 2 and 5 (CXADR) is expressed in mouse germ cells, suggesting the possibility that these viruses could infect germ cells. To directly assess the risk of germline infection in vivo, we injected an adenovirus carrying the germ-cell-specific protamine promoter fused to the bacterial lacZ reporter gene into the left ventricular cavity of mice and then monitored expression of the reporter gene in germ cells. To differentiate between infection of stem cells and differentiating spermatogenic cells, we analyzed expression of the reporter <b>cassette</b> at different <b>times</b> after viral delivery. Under all conditions tested, mice did not express the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase protein in developing spermatids or in mature epididymal spermatozoa. Primary germ cells cultured in vitro were also refractory to adenoviral infection.

In order to continue with his day-to-day activities he depends on an audio <b>cassette</b> <b>timed</b> every morning by himself the previous night. There are only 2 people in his life who know about his medical condition his Doctor and his Uncle (Nassar). He also has a Girl Friend Madhumitha (Riya Sen). Aditya has 2 Important rules in his everyday regimen 1. Not to get drunk out side. 2. And no matter where he goes he has to ensure he sleeps only in his home. Because he has to listen the tape next morning or else he will not remember anything. One fine day all his friends in the office call him to a party and force him to drink he gets fully drunk and wakes up in his bedroom {{the next morning the}} tape he uses everyday to refresh his memory is erased and he has no clue who did it he starts to reconstruct his memories by whatever is available in his sight. As he starts to leave his flat police come and interrogate him and asks him that he has complained about a missing car. As he doesn't remember the same he denies giving a complaint however the police finds the car in the basement parking they open the car and find the dead body of Aditya's uncle in the car's trunk. He gets arrested and the police initially think that he is lying but eventually when he is submitted to court the judge submits him for medical examination and they come to understand that he is a patient of short term memory loss. As the case is still not solved police officer Anjali (Sneha Ullal) takes up the case by specially requesting the D.G.P. Now the story goes back into flashback where Aditya and Anjali are actually college sweethearts and break up because of a minor misunderstanding after which Aditya reconciles and try to reach her back but then he meets with an accident and forgets his past. Now the story again returns to present where Anjali gets deeply involved with the investigation but meets with a dead end at every corner and finally Aditya decides that he himself can solve the case and as the only problem is if he sleeps he will forget hence he decides not to sleep till the case is solved he tries to dig into his past and see if he can find any clues and he finds out that Anjali was actually his girlfriend. Finally he calls up Madhumitha and Anjali tell them that he has solved the case and asks them to come at 7 the next morning when he will reveal the murderer. Aditya believes that Anjali might be the killer and waits for dawn he controls himself the whole night but just as it was about it be 7 his eyes finally give out and he falls asleep by the time he wakes up he sees both Anjali and Madhumitha are holding guns against each other and both ask Aditya to help. Finally Aditya shoots Madhumitha out of instinct and she dies instantly there. Madhumitha's brother comes out and reveals the entire crime to Anjali he confesses that Madhumitha wants to become the Managing Director of the company but as Aditya is the legal heir he will precede his uncle to that post hence she plans and becomes Aditya's Girl Friend with an intent to steal the entire property but as his uncle came to know about that fact Madhumitha and her brother kill him and keep the deadbody in Aditya's car so that the police may suspect him. The movie ends with Aditya getting married to Anjali who later on reminds him every morning about his past without him referring to a tape.|$|R
40|$|Vector {{construction}} with restriction enzymes (REs) typically {{involves the}} ligation of a digested donor fragment (insert) to a reciprocally digested recipient fragment (vector backbone). Creating a suitable cloning plan becomes {{increasingly difficult for}} complex strategies requiring repeated insertions such as constructing multiple short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vectors for RNA interference (RNAi) studies. The problem lies in the reduced availability of suitable RE recognition sites with {{an increasing number of}} cloning events and or vector size. This report details a technically simple, directional cloning solution using REs with compatible cohesive ends that are repeatedly destroyed and simultaneously re-introduced with each round of cloning. Donor fragments can be made by PCR or sub-cloned from pre-existing vectors and inserted ad infinitum in any combination. The design incorporates several cloning cores in order to be compatible with as many donor sequences as possible. We show that joining sub-combinations made in parallel is more time-efficient than sequential construction (of one <b>cassette</b> at a <b>time)</b> for any combination of 4 or more insertions. Screening for the successful construction of combinations using Taq polymerase based PCR became increasingly difficult with increasing number of repeated sequence elements. A Pfu polymerase based PCR was developed and successfully used to amplify combinations of up to eleven consecutive hairpin expression cassettes. The identified PCR conditions can be beneficial to others working with multiple shRNA or other repeated sequences, and the infinitely expandable cloning strategy serves as a genera...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{camcorder}} role, {{the smaller}} form S-VHS-C camcorder enjoyed limited success among home video users. It was more popular for the amateur video industry, as it allowed {{for at least}} second generation copies at reasonable quality (necessary for editing). JVC, Panasonic, and Sony have sold industrial S-VHS decks for amateur and semi-professional production use. Some public-access television stations and other low-budget cable TV venues used the S-VHS format, both for acquisition and subsequent studio editing, but the network studios largely avoided S-VHS, as descendants of the more expensive Betacam format had already become a de facto industry standard. S-VHS-C competed directly with Hi8, the latter offering smaller <b>cassettes,</b> longer running <b>time,</b> and ultimately selling much better. A number {{of colleges and universities}} also used S-VHS as a teaching tool for students, as the tapes cost less and offered more recording time than Betacam SP tapes, and yet students could still be trained on professional-level equipment. Plus on the professional level in the US a number of local access TV stations, and in Canada local cable channels used S-VHS in the 1990s to record and playback local programs, such as city councils and Christmas parades. For most of these stations, while the 3/4 U-Matics that they had been using were being phased out, but digital video was still years away, S-VHS was used to record from the composite setups that were still in place for U-Matic production.|$|R
40|$|Cell-to-cell fusion can be {{quantified}} by endowing acceptor and donor cells with latent reporter genes/proteins and activators of these genes/proteins, respectively. One way to accomplish this goal is by using a bipartite lentivirus vector (LV) -based cell fusion assay {{system in which the}} cellular fusion partners are transduced with a flippase-activatable Photinus pyralis luciferase (PpLuc) expression unit (acceptor cells) or with a recombinant gene encoding FLPeNLS+, a nuclear-targeted and molecularly evolved version of flippase (donor cells). Fusion of both cell populations will lead to the FLPe-dependent generation of a functional PpLuc gene. PpLuc activity is typically measured in cell lysates, precluding consecutive analysis of one cell culture. Therefore, in this study the PpLuc-coding sequence was replaced by that of Gaussia princeps luciferase (GpLuc), a secretory protein allowing repeated analysis of the same cell culture. In myotubes the spread of FLPeNLS+ may be limited due to its nuclear localization signal (NLS) causing low signal outputs. To test this hypothesis, myoblasts were transduced with LVs encoding either FLPeNLS+ or an NLS-less version of FLPe (FLPeNLS-) and subsequently co-cultured in different ratios with myoblasts containing the FLPe-activatable GpLuc expression <b>cassette.</b> At different <b>times</b> after induction of cell-to-cell fusion the GpLuc activity in the culture medium was determined. FLPeNLS+ and FLPeNLS- both activated the latent GpLuc gene but when the percentage of FLPe-expressing myoblasts was limiting, FLPeNLS+ generally yielded slightly higher signals than FLPeNLS- while at low acceptor-to-donor cell ratios FLPeNLS- was usually superior. The ability of FLPeNLS+ to spread through myofibers and to induce reporter gene expression is thus not limited by its NLS. However, at high FLPe concentrations the presence of the NLS negatively affected reporter gene expression. In summary, a rapid and simple chemiluminescence assay for quantifying cell-to-cell fusion progression based on GpLuc has been developed...|$|R

40|$|Most subsea {{installations}} {{have their}} own, integrated control and automation systems. In cases {{where this is}} impossible or the mechanism fails, the only unit that can handle such problems is the ROV. This makes the ROV essential for subsea intervention. However, challenging conditions makes the ROV operations difficult. This report will present a new tool called RITS - ROV Intervention Tool Skid, created to simplify these subsea operations. The RITS system is developed by utilizing conventional subsea technology only. The main idea is to introduce a fixed docking solution. It will ensure a rigid and fixed position between the ROV and the ROV panels. The docking receptacle, an API 17 D, will secure a completely locked connection to the subsea unit. From this rigid position the operator may perform the work without any disturbance of the water flow. The locked position provides new opportunities for the ROV; it opens for pre-programmed control of the manipulator and other tools. Robotics technology is frequently used in the onshore industry; however lack of fixed positions has previously excluded robotics subsea. This is changed by the new docked position, and {{an example of a}} pre-programmed manipulator will be presented as a part of this thesis. A manipulator requires a hydraulic system, which can be designed to operate more than one manipulator. The hydraulic systems are controlled by an embedded control unit connected to a computer with a control screen (HMI). The extra capacity of the hydraulic system is used to operate special tools, which are installed inside cassettes. RITS will be able to carry three <b>cassettes</b> at the <b>time,</b> and the customer can choose between five cassettes depending of what kind of operation the ROV is supposed to perform. The different cassettes all contain different tools, and since an HPU is installed, even a hot stab cassette is possible. This study indicates that the cassettes, the manipulator and the HPU system developed will work. The docking system however needs extensive testing before RITS can be produced. If the docking gives satisfying results during the tests, all the required documentation and design specifications are presented. The docking solution is the component making all the other systems possible. The RITS should therefore be able to improve the working situation for the ROV operations. </p...|$|R
