50|$|In 1848 a {{pamphlet}} called “The bubble of the age” or “The fallacy <b>of</b> <b>railway</b> investment, <b>Railway</b> <b>Accounts</b> and <b>Railway</b> dividends” {{alleged that the}} dividend paid by Hudson’s companies were paid out of capital rather than revenue. Hudson was attacked by Midland shareholder and Liverpool shipowner J H Brankner in February 1849, over his fight with the GNR.

He undertook several prospective diggings but found no minable copper. By 1848, he had interests in a timber business associated with the building of Christ Church in North Adelaide, but the death of the contractor and the loss of his workers to the Bendigo goldfields resulted in another business failure. In 1851 he went to the Victorian goldfields, where he was modestly successful and returned to South Australia, where he was engaged as mercantile manager for the solicitor Atkinson (who he left in 1852), then with Hart and Hughes of Port Adelaide. In 1859 he purchased a dairy farm along the Coorong, which proved uneconomical. He tried sheep-farming in partnership with G. M. Brown but footrot caused unsupportable losses and in 1863 the family returned to Adelaide. He worked as accountant for Henry Hill & Co., then John Rounsevell, then as an independent agent. Finally he was employed as an accountant for the South Australian Railways from 1870 to 1883, when he retired, having reached the position <b>of</b> Controller <b>of</b> <b>Railway</b> <b>Accounts.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{functioning}} of accounting in the social, economic and political contexts surrounding the financing of the early U. K. railways. The conventional view of economic historians is that the early U. K. railways were financed by an irrational stock market “mania”, followed by the inevitable crash in which many of the initial investors were ruined. Here we explore an alternative explanation implied by a comment by Marx in volume 3, of Capital (1981), that these events were elements <b>of</b> a “great <b>railway</b> swindle” in which accounting was deeply implicated. Marx provides no direct support for his statement. However, {{the history of the}} early U. K. railways has been extensively researched. This work is re-examined to assess the a priori validity of the “swindle hypothesis”. Its acceptance would have important implications for accepted views of the nature of capitalism and accounting in the mid-nineteenth century. According to economic historians, the “mania” was a product of laissez faire capitalism. According to accounting historians, the notorious manipulations <b>of</b> <b>railway</b> <b>accounts</b> during and after the “mania” were the consequence of a lack of “generally accepted accounting principles”. However, according to the swindle hypothesis, the “mania” and its afterwath were the product of a rational and rapacious social hierarchy, for whom accounting was simply a tool to be manipulated. The paper concludes that while {{there is a need for}} more research, the hypothesis is sufficiently consistent with the evidence available to be firmly on the agenda of accounting history...|$|R

5000|$|The Edmondson railway ticket was {{a system}} for {{recording}} the payment <b>of</b> <b>railway</b> fares and <b>accounting</b> for the revenue raised, introduced in the 1840s. [...] It is named after its inventor, Thomas Edmondson, a trained cabinet maker, who became a station master on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway in England. He introduced his system on the Manchester and Leeds Railway. Previously, railway companies had used handwritten tickets, as was the practice for stagecoaches, but it was laborious for a ticket clerk to write out a ticket for each passenger and long queues were common at busy stations. A faster means of issuing pre-printed tickets was needed. There was also a need to provide accountability by serial-numbering each ticket to prevent unscrupulous clerks from pocketing the fares, since they had to reconcile the takings against the serial numbers of the unsold tickets {{at the end of}} each day.|$|R

40|$|The design <b>of</b> <b>railway</b> {{sleepers}} must <b>account</b> for irregularities of {{the train}} or the rails that generate dynamic loads. The sleepers could develop cracks during a train passage although not influential enough to disturb immediately the global track system. However, these cracks can {{pose a threat to}} the overall stiffness properties as they can propagate further under repeated loads induced by the train. Consequently they can cause fatigue, which is a structural failure at service condition. This will later constitute a major maintenance item if the problem is not properly addressed. It is intended that the application of highstrength concrete (HSC) with the inclusion <b>of</b> fibres in <b>railway</b> sleepers could reduce, delay or in certain conditions arrest the rate of crack growth. The design of sleeper was proven to comply in partial of the referenced Standards requirements. The fabrication works undertaken also proved that all procedures were followed satisfactorily and that the laboratory of the Faculty of Civil Engineering was able to handle the production. Structural tests carried out where loads were applied at rail seat showed that behaviour of HSFC sleepers had high flexural strength capacities due to the presence of fibres...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Controversy {{exists as}} to whether {{electric}} charges of plasma proteins influence their transport across the peritoneal membrane during CAPD. Fixed negative charges in the peritoneal membrane are diminished during peritonitis in rats. METHODS: Peritoneal <b>clearances</b> <b>of</b> 10 proteins and their isoforms were used to establish the relationship between peritoneal clearance and molecular weight. The observed protein clearances were compared with the predicted clearances based on molecular weight. <b>Clearances</b> <b>of</b> proteins with different charge but identical size were compared. Stable patients and peritonitis patients were compared. Results. Only the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> lipase, LDH 4 / 5 and IgG 3 were {{significantly different from the}} predicted values (P <= 0. 05). The peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> slightly anionic beta 2 microglobulin (1072 microl/min) and cationic lysozyme (572 microl/min) showed no evidence for charge selectivity; neither did the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> slightly anionic transferrin (86 microl/min) and highly anionic albumin (99 microl/min). The peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> IgG 1, IgG 2 and IgG 4 were identical (32, 31 and 31 microl/min), despite their different charge. The peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> cationic LDH 4 / 5 was 137 microl/min and higher than the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> neutral LDH 3 (97 microl/min, P= 0. 01) and LDH 1 (59 microl/min, P= 0. 02). These results suggested charge selectivity; however in five additional patients during peritonitis the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> LDH 4 / 5 increased to 10 times the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> LDH 1. Local LDH isoenzyme release from the cells present in the dialysate was shown to be responsible in stable and peritonitis patients. Likewise, the higher peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> neutral pancreatic amylase (234 microl/min) compared to anionic salivary amylase (142 microl/min, P= 0. 03) could probably be attributed to local release of the former from the pancreas, as the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> lipase (highly anionic) was higher than predicted and the difference remained during peritonitis. CONCLUSIONS: The peritoneal membrane constitutes a size- but probably not a charge-selective barrier for the transport of macromolecules between blood and dialysate during stable CAP...|$|R
