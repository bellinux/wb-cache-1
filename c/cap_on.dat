5|$|Fowler did not feature during England's {{qualifying}} {{campaign for}} the 1998 FIFA World Cup, mainly due to a serious knee ligament injury, and thus missed out on Glenn Hoddle's 22-man squad for the tournament. He did, however, manage to score his first goal for his country on 29 March 1997, netting the second goal in a 2–0 friendly win against Mexico at Wembley Stadium. A second goal followed in his next <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> 15 November, netting just before half-time in the 2–0 friendly win against Cameroon.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} data on physician {{malpractice insurance}} premiums and state tort law to analyze how physicians in various medical specialties are differentially affected by <b>caps</b> <b>on</b> noneconomic damages. As higher premiums {{put pressure on}} legislators to enact damage caps, I instrument <b>caps</b> <b>on</b> noneconomic damages with enactment of tort reform measures that do not affect malpractice premiums to uncover the effect of <b>caps</b> <b>on</b> noneconomic damages on such premiums. I find evidence to support that, in terms of dollars saved, physicians in high risk specialties benefit more from noneconomic damage caps than physicians in low risk specialties. However, in percentage terms, I find that physicians in all specialties essentially benefit equally from <b>caps</b> <b>on</b> noneconomic damages...|$|R

5|$|In November 2009, Wright was {{sufficiently}} {{concerned that the}} Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment bill would result in increased emissions that she publicly urged politicians three times not to adopt the National Government's legislation.

He scored consecutive hat-tricks on 8 October 1960 and 19 October, in victories at Northern Ireland and Luxembourg. On 15 April 1961, Greaves scored another hat-trick in a 9–3 victory over Scotland at Wembley, and also had a fourth goal disallowed for offside.|$|E
