Seeking to benefit from being nearest to the president, Chandler sat between Roosevelt and Barkley {{in the back seat}} of the open-topped vehicle that transported them to Latonia Race Track, the site of Roosevelt's first speech. Throughout his tour of the state, Roosevelt endorsed Barkley while remaining friendly with Chandler; after Roosevelt's departure, Chandler played up Roosevelt's complimentary remarks about him while downplaying or ignoring <b>critical</b> <b>remarks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cornelis Suijk—a former {{director}} of the Anne Frank Foundation and president of the U.S. Center for Holocaust Education Foundation—announced in 1999 {{that he was in the}} possession of five pages that had been removed by Otto Frank from the diary prior to publication; Suijk claimed that Otto Frank gave these pages to him shortly before his death in 1980. The missing diary entries contain <b>critical</b> <b>remarks</b> by Anne Frank about her parents' strained marriage and discuss Frank's lack of affection for her mother. Some controversy ensued when Suijk claimed publishing rights over the five pages; he intended to sell them to raise money for his foundation. The Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, the formal owner of the manuscript, demanded the pages be handed over. In 2000 the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science agreed to donate US$300,000 to Suijk's foundation, and the pages were returned in 2001. Since then, they have been included in new editions of the diary.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Akershus County Municipality was {{regarding}} {{what to do}} with the line. The first proposal came in 2002, when it was stated that the metro should terminate at Lysakerelven and that the rest of the line be operated as part of the tramway. Civitas published a report for the county in 2006. <b>Critical</b> <b>remarks</b> regarding costs and patronage issued by Oslo Sporveier were ignored. Based on the report, Akershus County Council passed a metro upgrade of the line. The cost from the municipal border to Kolsås was estimated at 677 million Norwegian krone. Both a metro and a tramway alternative were estimated to give the same traffic. The metro alternative would use four to eight minutes less to the city center, while the tramway would have six to eight departures per hour.|$|E

Many of the officers were retired or dead, when a revised edition was published in 1940 but the excised passages were not restored. The British Army Military Operations.... volumes have been criticised for dishonesty, in not blaming GHQ for the extent of British casualties. The authors have been accused of exculpating Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) from December 1915 {{to the end of the}} war, by default. In 2011, Neil Wells wrote that as the history is a description of events, rather than an analytical work with criticism and conclusions, Haig and other commanders escape explicit blame for failures, yet the reader is left free to form conclusions.|$|E

At the same time, her father was serving time in prison for having made a <b>critical</b> <b>remark</b> to an employee about Hitler.|$|R
50|$|When perceiving, explaining, or criticizing human behaviour, people {{distinguish}} between intentional and unintentional actions.

Others are the environmental conditions or pre-cognitive matters. For example, a <b>critical</b> <b>remark</b> that is judged to be intentional on the part of the receiver of the message can be viewed as a hurtful insult.

2500|$|Critics {{were divided}} on the {{gameplay}} aspects of The Baconing.

GamePro's Will Herring, however, felt the gameplay was repetitive and that the fetch quests did not feature enough variety. Though Christian Donlan of Eurogamer had some <b>critical</b> <b>remarks</b> in regards to gameplay he did note that the game is [...] "a fiercely likeable time-waster."

For him, the differences were mostly the result of differences of ability.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the interior transmission eigenvalue (ITE) problem, which arises when scattering by inhomogeneous media is studied. The ITE {{problem is not}} self-adjoint. We show that positive ITEs are observable together with plus or minus signs that are defined by the direction of motion of the corresponding eigenvalues of the scattering matrix (when the latter approach z= 1). We obtain a Weyl type formula for the counting function of positive ITEs, which are taken together with ascribed signs. Comment: Some corrections in the proofs are made.

2500|$|<b>Critical</b> <b>remarks</b> {{from within}} the field include the {{observations}} of Lukoff and Lu, and the criticism of Walach. In their contribution {{to the field of}} spiritually oriented psychotherapy Lukoff and Lu discuss {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} Transpersonal psychotherapy and Transpersonal psychology. Among the strengths is its basis of theory and practice that allows for communication and dialogue with other cultures, and native healers. Among the weaknesses is a lack of theoretical agreement, which has led to internal debates, and attention from critics who question the validity of the transpersonal approach. Another source, close to the field, is The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology. In a chapter from this book Walach brings attention to unsolved problems within the field. According to the editors the criticism represents [...] "the sort of self-criticism that is mandatory within a responsible discipline".|$|E
2500|$|The {{treatise}} {{was published}} four times, the last printing in 1834. Reception was mixed. While some Southerners {{used it to}} defend the institution of slavery, others saw Kingsley's support of a free class of blacks {{as a prelude to}} the abolition of it. abolitionists considered Kingsley's arguments for slavery weak and wrote that logically, the planter should conclude that slavery must be eradicated. Lydia Child, a New York-based abolitionist, included him in 1836 on a list of people perpetuating the [...] "evils of slavery". Although Kingsley was wealthy, learned, and powerful, the treatise was a factor in the decline of his reputation in Florida. He became embroiled in a political scandal with Florida's first governor, William DuVal. The governor was quoted in newspapers making scathingly <b>critical</b> <b>remarks</b> about Kingsley's motives and his mixed-race family after the planter petitioned to have DuVal removed from his office for corruption.|$|E
2500|$|Several of Károlyi's {{athletes from}} the [...] "six-pack" [...] era have criticized his {{training}} methods. Some {{of his former}} athletes, including Kristie Phillips, Dominique Moceanu, and Erica Stokes, have stated publicly that Károlyi was verbally and psychologically abusive during workouts. Károlyi's constant <b>critical</b> <b>remarks</b> about weight and body type were said to drive some gymnasts to develop eating disorders and low self-esteem. Some gymnasts, such as Phillips, Moceanu, and 1988 Olympian Chelle Stack, have also said they were compelled to continue training and competing even when coping with serious injuries such as broken bones. In one interview, Moceanu, {{who was one of}} Károlyi's final protégés, said: [...] "I'm sure Bela saw injuries, but if you were injured, Bela didn't want to see it. ... You had to deal with it. I was intimidated. He looked down on me. He was six-feet something, and I was four-foot nothing." ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{category}} of "intrinsic" effects is proposed {{to be added}} to the two already known kinematic and dynamical categories. An example of intrinsic effect is predicted, its origin source is established, and a scheme of its experimental detection is proposed. This effect lowers to non-relativistic values the propagation velocity of a plane electromagnetic wave in a vacuum, when a time-independent homogeneous magnetic field is superposed over it. This result, pertaining to the classical Maxwell theory, follows from exact calculations. A <b>critical</b> <b>remark</b> on gravitational waves' detection is given.

[...] The Herald Tribune also wrote, “The acting warrants better material…” and The New York Sun also wrote, [...] "Put 'Anna Lucasta' down as a credible presentation of a spotty and uncertain play." [...] Even {{the director of the}} production, Harry Wagstaff Gribble, felt like it was not a perfect play but the forefront of what the future could hold for African-American actors in the theatre and it accomplished some of the ideas that he wanted to do with black theatre and how to represent African Americans as individuals.|$|R
50|$|As a sympathizer of the Reformation, he {{corresponded with}} reformers such as Zwingli and Vadian. A <b>critical</b> <b>remark</b> {{of his wife}} on the veneration of Mary earned him a {{reprimand}} by the city council and a substantial pay cut in 1523, {{and as a consequence}} the family moved to Rottweil two years later. However, there he got involved in the conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, too, and even spent some time in jail. When the Protestants were banned from Rottweil in 1529, he more than gladly followed a call of Bern (which had become Protestant in 1528) to serve as the city's chronicler. From 1535 to 1537 he again served also as the city physician. He died between 1 August 1546 and 21 February 1547; the exact date is unknown.|$|R
