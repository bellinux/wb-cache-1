40|$|LED {{technology}} {{has been a major}} breakthrough for our modern society. Among its virtues we find energy savings compared with incandescent and fluorescent lighting technologies, {{and the creation of a}} new information channel signalling with LED screens. LED displays have enabled way to dynamically inform people in almost any scenario and from a great distance. In the last 25 years an industry specialized in manufacturing LED screens has been developed. One of these specialized companies, MP Electronics, intends to develop a new product consisting of a LED screen to display the time and date. In addition,the product will have the option to work as a chronometer or stopwatch, controlled through an infrared remote control. This product is intended for places such as offices, receptions or even universities where the stopwatch function is very useful for lectures or examinations. The goal of this TFC is the designing of the product's prototype both at the hardware as well as the software level. This process will include the device initial concept, electronic components selection, electrical circuit and printed circuit board design, C language microcontroller programming and finally the assessment of the design in view of optimizing it for industrial production. For the device development we will work with a microcontroller, which will deal with the management of all the other components; an integrated RTCC (Real Time <b>Clock</b> <b>Calendar)</b> with SPI communication in order to obtain one of the main requirements, the minimum time deviation in the long-term; a circuit for infrared communication, with witch the user can access all the device functionality; and finally the entire electronics designed to display information with the matrix LED display. Being a project developed for industry, it is essential to develop the best product taking into account two important factors: time and cost...|$|E
40|$|Time is objectively measurable, but is subjectively {{understood}} {{within our}} own time perspective (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999) and representations of time (Margolies & Crawford, 2008; McGlone & Harding, 1998). The present thesis is in two parts. Part 1 explored how our perceptions and representations of time may influence our emotions. Study 1 sought to validate a measure of two time representations (ego-moving and time-moving) and found that people think about time in a metaphor-consistent manner across <b>clock,</b> <b>calendar,</b> and spatial questions (N= 94). Study 2 (N= 128) found that those choosing an ego-moving representation {{were more likely to}} see themselves approaching events, reported higher levels of personal agency and scored higher in the Future time perspective. Those who choose a time-moving representation saw the event as approaching them, had significantly lower scores on personal agency and scored highly on Present Fatalism. Study 3 (N= 199) found that those who reported an ego-moving representation were significantly happier, whereas those reporting a time-moving representation were significantly more anxious and depressed. Study 4 (N= 232) found that when happiness is induced, participants report significantly more ego-moving representations, whereas when anxiety or sadness are induced, participants report significantly more time-moving representations. Study 5 (N= 106) found that when ego-moving representations were induced, participants reported significantly higher happiness scores, whereas when time-moving was induced participants report significantly higher anxiety and sadness/depression. Part 2 explored one aspect of ego-moving representations of time, that of goal-getting and perceptions of time morem closely. In study 6 (N= 139), time perspective was explored in relation to non-achievement of goals. Findings suggest those high in Present Fatalism procrastinate significantly more frequently and often only form the intention towards achieving their goals, and were significantly more upset at past failures. Fatalists also tended not to use cognitive reappraisal strategies to enable them to think differently about how to achieve their goal in future attempts. Those high in the Future time perspective were less likely to procrastinate, less upset at non-attainment of goals, and did tend to use cognitive reappraisal. Study 7 (N= 162) examined time perspective, self-efficacy, and goal achievement. For those who achieved their goal within 7 days, the Past Positive and Future time perspectives positively predicted self-efficacy, whereas Present Fatalism negatively predicted self-efficacy. Finally, study 8 (N= 76) sought to determine whether focussing on different time perspectives were of help in achieving goals. Results revealed that by focusing on what we have achieved in the past and thinking about managing our future time in the same way we think about our present time may help us to achieve our goals by increasing self-efficacy.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a different way}} to measure time using event clocks, with which we can observe a normal distribution of intraday stock returns. Most finance studies employ a ‘default’ time measurement that uses a <b>calendar</b> <b>clock.</b> Cumulative evidence from prior literature shows that returns with a <b>calendar</b> <b>clock</b> follow a distribution with an excess kurtosis and a heavier tail, relative to a normal distribution.

50|$|In 1864 his {{improvements}} to the <b>calendar</b> <b>clock</b> led to an 1865 patent {{and the formation of}} the Ithaca <b>Calendar</b> <b>Clock</b> Company in 1868. Their working capital was only $8,000 and manufacturing accordingly started on a very small scale. The clock proved a success and the business grew rapidly, so that a year later the factory moved to larger quarters, continuing to grow until 1874 when a change of management saw the capital increasing to $150,000. This necessitated the construction of a large three-story brick building which burnt down in 1876, but was promptly rebuilt.
