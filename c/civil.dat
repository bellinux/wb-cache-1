5|$|<b>Civil</b> partnerships, {{introduced}} by the <b>Civil</b> Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal to, those of <b>civil</b> marriage. The ability {{to enter into a}} <b>civil</b> partnership ended on 16 November 2015. Constitutional protections granted to spouses, such as the spouse of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against their spouse in most cases, is one example of protections granted under <b>civil</b> partnerships. Spouses may further claim privilege in so far as necessary to protect the constitutional right to marital privacy. No such constitutional protections exist for <b>civil</b> partnerships. Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law exist. The legislation provides rights for participants in long-term cohabiting relationships (opposite- or same-sex) who have not entered into a <b>civil</b> partnership or marriage. The following entry focuses primarily on the same-sex <b>civil</b> partnership aspect of the Act, as opposed to the cohabitation aspect.|$|E

5|$|Courts {{are divided}} into three categories: <b>civil,</b> religious, and special. The <b>civil</b> courts deal with <b>civil</b> and {{criminal}} matters, including cases brought against the government. The <b>civil</b> courts include Magistrate Courts, Courts of First Instance, Courts of Appeal, High Administrative Courts which hear cases relating to administrative matters, and the Constitutional Court which {{was set up in}} 2012 in order to hear cases regarding the constitutionality of laws. Although Islam is the state religion, the constitution preserves a degree of religious and personal freedom. Religious law only extends to matters of personal status such as divorce and inheritance in religious courts, and is partially based on Islamic Sharia law. The special court deals with cases forwarded by the <b>civil</b> one.|$|E
5|$|During World War II <b>civil</b> {{aerodromes}} {{were taken}} over for military use, existing military airfields were expanded, and new ones were built.

Surplus military airfields were closed, and in some cases, for example Beccles, subsequently re-opened as <b>civil</b> aerodromes. The Ministry of <b>Civil</b> Aviation was created to regulate all <b>civil</b> aviation in the UK, and this task remained the responsibility of government departments until {{the establishment of the}} independent CAA in 1972.|$|E

With encouragement from community activists in south Minneapolis, the Minneapolis city government hired Dworkin and MacKinnon to draft an antipornography <b>civil</b> rights ordinance as {{an amendment to the}} Minneapolis city <b>civil</b> rights ordinance.|$|E
