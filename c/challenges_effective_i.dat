40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a summary of}} a multi-stage research project described through the narratives of the two authors. The research project investigated what students thought were <b>effective</b> (<b>i.</b> e., Good) and less <b>effective</b> (<b>i.</b> e., Bad) ways to learn English. The paper presents {{some of the main}} findings of the various components of the studies. One important finding relevant to educators working in self-access centres is that students responding to the open-ended portions of the study did not mention electronic, online or multimedia resources, or self-access learning centres (SALCs). Follow-up closed-response questionnaire findings indicated that students evaluated electronic resources and SALCs positively as good ways to learn outside of class. The authors suggest that a questionnaire-based list of ways to learn English out of class is an effective way to raise students’ awareness of alternatives for learners. Subsequent diary studies showed how participants used ideas that were introduced mainly via the questionnaire for their outside class study...|$|R
