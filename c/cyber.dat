5|$|Prior to the 1980s crimes {{involving}} {{computers were}} dealt with using existing laws. The first computer crimes were {{recognized in the}} 1978 Florida Computer Crimes Act, which included legislation against the unauthorized modification or deletion of data on a computer system. Over {{the next few years}} the range of computer crimes being committed increased, and laws were passed to deal with issues of copyright, privacy/harassment (e.g., <b>cyber</b> bullying, <b>cyber</b> stalking, and online predators) and child pornography. It was not until the 1980s that federal laws began to incorporate computer offences. Canada was the first country to pass legislation in 1983. This was followed by the US Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 1986, Australian amendments to their crimes acts in 1989 and the British Computer Misuse Act in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The feuds between Triple H and Umaga, Rey Mysterio and Finlay, and Matt Hardy and Montel Vontavious Porter also continued, {{resulting}} in their matches at <b>Cyber</b> Sunday.

5|$|The {{popularity}} of Defense of the Ancients increased over time. The scenario was featured by Computer Gaming World {{in a review}} of new maps and mods in Warcraft III. DotA Allstars became an important tournament scenario, starting with its prominence at the debut of Blizzard's BlizzCon convention in 2005. DotA Allstars was also featured in the Malaysia and Singapore World <b>Cyber</b> Games starting in 2005, and the World <b>Cyber</b> Games Asian Championships beginning with the 2006 season. Defense of the Ancients was included in the game lineup for the internationally recognized Cyberathlete Amateur League and CyberEvolution leagues.

5|$|After {{losing the}} tag team title, Morrison and The Miz entered a feud with ECW {{newcomers}} Evan Bourne and Ricky Ortiz, who {{they had previously}} mocked (and continued to do so) on the Dirt Sheet. They also had an Internet-centered feud with Raws Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG) based on which WWE.com online show was better: the Dirt Sheet or Cryme Tyme's Word Up.

In January 2007, at New Year's Revolution, DX and Rated-RKO fought to a no contest after Triple H suffered a legitimate torn right quadriceps (similar to the one he suffered in 2001 in his other leg) 15 minutes into the match. Surgery was successfully performed on January 9, 2007 by Dr. James Andrews.|$|E
5|$|At the 2014 Wales summit, {{the leaders}} of NATO's member states reaffirmed their pledge to spend the {{equivalent}} of at least 2% of their gross domestic products on defense. In 2015, five of its 28 members met that goal. On 15 June 2016, NATO officially recognized cyberwarfare as an operational domain of war, just like land, sea and aerial warfare. This means that any <b>cyber</b> attack on NATO members can trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Montenegro became the 29th and newest member of NATO on 5 June 2017, amid strong objections from Russia.|$|E
5|$|Chris and Bryan Sokol of the Canadian Online Explorer {{reviewed}} and rated {{the show on}} a scale out of 10, giving it a 7. This was the same rating given to the 2009 edition by Nick Tylwalk, but lower than the 7.5 out of 10 given to the 2007 edition by Chris Sokol. Compared to TNA's previous PPV event No Surrender, Bound for Glory was received better as No Surrender was given a 3 out of 10 by Jason Clevett. Meanwhile, Chris and Bryan Sokol gave TNA's next PPV event Turning Point a 7 out of 10.

Compared to WWE's WrestleMania XXIV PPV event on March30, Bound for Glory IV was outperformed as WrestleMania XXIV was given a 9 out of 10 by Dale Plummer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cyber</b> Rights {{analyzes}} {{the legal issues}} involved with communicating on the Internet, including those relating to Internet privacy and government involvement. The book is written with a first-person perspective: the reader learns of the author's morning ritual, {{the fact that his}} cat is named Francie and that he married a woman he met through a Bulletin Board System. Godwin's motivation was to keep the Internet safe from government actions that restrict freedom of speech. He asserts that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution should apply equally to the Internet as it does to other media.|$|E
5|$|DotA {{became a}} feature at several {{worldwide}} tournaments, including Blizzard Entertainment's BlizzCon and the Asian World <b>Cyber</b> Games. Critical reception to DotA was positive, with it being {{called one of}} the most popular mods of any game. DotA is largely attributed to being the most significant inspiration for the multiplayer online battle arena genre. American video game developer Valve Corporation acquired the intellectual property rights to DotA in 2009 to develop a stand-alone sequel, Dota 2, which released in July 2013.|$|E

5|$|James {{dropped the}} WWE Women's Championship on August 14 to Lita, after Lita hit James {{with the title}} belt. After the Women's Championship was vacated due to the {{retirement}} of Trish Stratus, James entered a tournament to determine the new champion.

Metropolitan newspapers worked with Turner to promote the videos through grab-bag give-aways. Turner sold merchandise through several international distributors, and expected to make a $60million profit per year in the Asia-Pacific region alone.|$|E
5|$|The Microsoft Malware Protection Center {{identified}} a trend away from WSF files {{in favor of}} LNK files and PowerShell scripting. These LNK shortcut files install Locky ransomware by automating infection operations {{rather than relying on}} traditional user downloads of WSF files—all of which is made possible by the universal PowerShell Windows application. Unfortunately, <b>cyber</b> criminals have been able to leverage PowerShell for their attacks for years. In a recent report, the application was found to be involved in nearly 40% of endpoint security incidents. While attackers have been finding weaknesses in the Windows operating system for years, it’s clear that there’s something problematic with PowerShell scripting.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Triple H and Umaga {{continued}} after <b>Cyber</b> Sunday {{with the}} two choosing four other men to make a five-on-five elimination tag team match at Survivor Series. Matt Hardy, who was chosen to be on Triple H's team suffered an injury caused by Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) on the November 16 episode of SmackDown, which made the match at Survivor Series a four-on-five elimination tag team match. Triple H's team won the match after Jeff Hardy pinned Umaga.|$|E
5|$|Though Roshan {{maintained}} that they parted amicably, the media {{reported that the}} split was due to infidelity on his part, linking him with several actresses, most notably his Krrish 3 co-star Kangana Ranaut. Roshan denied {{having an affair with}} the actress, and filed a lawsuit against her in 2016 accusing her of <b>cyber</b> stalking and harassment. Denying the charges, Ranaut filed a counter-charge against Roshan, claiming that his lawsuit was an attempt to cover-up their affair for the benefit of his divorce proceedings. Owing to a lack of evidence, the Mumbai Police closed the case later that year.|$|E
5|$|Triple H {{then went}} on to defeat cleanly John Cena to {{successfully}} defend the WWE Championship at Night of Champions. On the June 23 episode of Raw, Triple H was drafted to the SmackDown brand {{as a part of the}} 2008 WWE draft, in the process making the WWE Championship exclusive to SmackDown. He defended the championship over the summer by defeating the likes of Edge at The Great American Bash and The Great Khali at SummerSlam, and was the only champion to retain his title at Unforgiven's Championship Scramble matches. After this, he successfully defended it against Jeff Hardy both at No Mercy and <b>Cyber</b> Sunday.|$|E
