40|$|This paper {{develops}} a valuation {{model of the}} real estate brokerage firm. A brokerage has a positive market valuation, while having a negligible book value. Options theory is used to value the firm. The firm writes an option by taking a contingent claim on income generated, through the <b>commission</b> <b>split.</b> The firm holds other options, including the right to modify the <b>commission</b> <b>split.</b> A valuation model for the firm permits a hiring strategy to be developed. Brokers vary by characteristics such as experience. Whether it is better to hire an experienced licensee over a rookie depends on the expected future career with the firm, commissions generated, and the achievement of sales targets. The value of a superstar to the firm is determined, to permit incentive structures on the commission to be generated. ...|$|R

40|$|The mission {{benefits}} of using both high thrust nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) and low acceleration, {{high specific impulse}} nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) to reduce piloted trip times to Mars with reasonable initial mass are assessed. Recent updates in mission design, such as the Earth fly-by return, are assessed for their impact on previous studies. In addition, the Synthesis <b>Commission</b> <b>split</b> mission to Mars in 2014 is also assessed using combined propulsion. Results show an 80 to 100 day reduction in trip time over the reference NTP or NEP systems and missions, with comparable or reduced vehicle initial masses. The impacts of the mission and system analyses upon technology planning and design are discussed...|$|R
50|$|On 23 November 1877, the Commission {{gave its}} decision. The <b>Commission</b> <b>split,</b> 2-1. The majority, {{composed}} of M. Delfosse and Sir Alexander Galt, ruled {{in favour of}} the British Government and held that the United States was to pay the British Government $5,500,000, in gold, as compensation for American fishing rights in British North American waters. The American Commissioner, Mr. Kellogg, dissented, stating that in his opinion the Treaty conferred greater advantages on the British Government than those conferred on the American Government. He also questioned whether the Commission could render a binding decision unless it was unanimous. Mr Foster, the American Agent, then registered a formal protest against the non-unanimous award.|$|R

In July, 1951 the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma had also filed a petition before the Indian Claims Commission for claims involving their removal to Oklahoma and substantially the same land takings under Moultrie and Payne's Landing as the Florida Seminoles. Because of the overlapping of claims, the <b>commission</b> <b>split</b> the Florida claim into 2 cases, one sharing the Oklahoma claims in the treaties and the other, dealing with Florida's sole claim to land taken for the Everglades National Park.|$|R

50|$|A Realtor that {{is acting}} as a Buyer's Agent has a {{significant}} economic conflict of interest if their <b>commission</b> is <b>split</b> with the Seller's Agent, as in most real estate transactions. Because a commissioned Buyer's Agent is paid more if the Buyer pays more money, the Buyer's Agent has a direct economic incentive to make the Buyer pay more for a property.|$|R
50|$|In mid-March 1792, Alexander Hamilton {{began the}} {{political}} and economic maneuvering necessary to contain the credit crisis affecting markets across the country. The charter creating the Bank of the United States had also set up the Sinking Fund Commission composed of Vice President John Adams, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Attorney General Edmund Randolph, Chief Justice John Jay, and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, charged with resolving financial crises. On March 21, 1792, with Jay absent from voting, the <b>commission</b> <b>split</b> on the decision to allow open-market purchases. Having received notice from William Seton that the Bank of New York was in trouble, Hamilton wished to have the government make purchases as it had in 1791, but was unable to do so while Jefferson and Randolph stood opposed. While still waiting for Jay’s formal and deciding vote, Randolph began to side with Hamilton on March 26, and with only Jefferson dissenting, the commission authorized $100,000 in open-market purchases of securities.|$|R
5000|$|KETV first {{signed on}} the air [...] on September 17, 1957; it was Omaha's third {{television}} station (behind WOW-TV, channel 6, now WOWT and KMTV, channel 3).

Incidentally, until KLKN-TV signed on from Lincoln in 1996 (by then, KOLN had switched to CBS), KETV served as the default ABC affiliate for Nebraska's state capital; to this day, KETV still retains significant viewership in Lincoln, and the station operates a news bureau in the city.

50|$|Hydro Tasmania {{was formed}} on the {{disaggregation}} of the Hydro-Electric Commission on 1 July 1998. This {{resulted in the}} <b>Commission</b> being <b>split</b> into three separate state-owned companies—Hydro Tasmania which generates the power, Transend Networks which transmits it across the state, and Aurora Energy, the retail arm, which sells and distributes it to customers. This was in anticipation of Tasmania joining the National Electricity Market, which occurred in May 2005. Transend has since merged with Aurora's distribution arm to form TasNetworks.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>split</b> <b>commissions</b> on broker effort in MLS sales. The joint effort of brokers to find a buyer for a given listing is maximized when the broker who locates a buyer first receives the entire <b>commission.</b> In contrast, <b>splitting</b> the <b>commission</b> between the listing and finding broker (when they differ) maximizes the joint profits of brokers. When competition among brokers to acquire listings is considered, however, the split brokers most prefer entails a smaller (though still positive) share for the listing broker {{in order to reduce}} wasteful competition for listings. While sellers still prefer to pay only the broker who finds a buyer, brokers may not be willing to acquire and share listings under such an arrangement.
