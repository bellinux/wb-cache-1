40|$|The {{future of}} {{technology}} in education is uncharted territory. Apart from the National Technology Statement ('Technology for Australian Schools,' 1992) {{there is no clear}} structuring, indicating the desired direction of computer technology within the education system. Yet at this very moment, many educators such as myself are implementing technology and computer education throughout the school curriculum. Educators should aim to encourage the application of technology, develop and understand the principles of technology, and explore the consequences of applying technology to different situations, thus treating technology not only as a process, but as a tool. Teachers in Australia are currently in a state of transition towards a more technologically focussed syllabus. It is here that teachers of the Graphics, Art, Film and Television, Drama and Design Education discipline are experiencing difficulties.

40|$|This practice-based project explores {{creative}} three-dimensional {{design and}} patternmaking processes applied to minimal cut and sew garments through an investigation between cloth and body. The question guiding {{the research was}} ?Can {{a different approach to}} garment shape development, which relates to past practice, be translated and refined to relate to mass production practices?? An answer to the research question was formed by re-instating the designer-maker at the centre of the development process in order to reconnect the cloth with the body, as well as the cloth with the making practice. This resulted in a system of patternmaking, which is referred to as ?The Cube Method?. This is a method of draping geometric shapes guided by cloth movement through and around the bodily form, in order to explore negative space, silhouette and shape.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} {{and production}} {{costs associated with}} the development of a competent immune response against nematode parasites is described, based on data from sheep. Anorexia and changes in metabolism are considered to be driven by the host immune response itself and the question is raised about the wisdom of seeking to strengthen immune responses by genetic selection. Several phases of the immune response are identified with different implications for loss of productivity and opportunity for moderation of immune responses and production losses by nutrition. Many animals are able to manage nematode infections with little loss of productivity. In an era when attempts are being made to reduce anthelmintic use and create refugia to reduce the rate of development of drench resistance, treatments based on individual animal performance relative to production targets set by assessment of the prevailing nutritional environment will become more common. These developments, have already occurred in relation to the haematophagic nematodes, for example the "Famacha" technique. <b>Computer-aided</b> weighing and <b>drafting</b> has potential for use with the less pathogenic nematodes prevalent in temperate regions though we need {{to know more about the}} pathophysiology and nutritional costs of infections with Nematodirus spp...|$|R
40|$|In many {{applications}} such as <b>computer-aided</b> design (CAD), <b>drafting,</b> descriptive geometry, geometric modeling, computer animation, and virtual reality, etc [...] real-time or time-critical rendering is required by three-dimensional interaction and manipulation to provide adequate information of complex objects. Traditionally, rendering techniques can be discussed in two major categories: shaded mode and wireframe mode. While shaded rendering algorithms create more realistic pictures, wireframe techniques are more efficient for generating line-drawing images that are often more informative. In wireframe images, it is preferred to display the hidden-lines in a special style to distinguish them from ordinary visible lines. Thus hidden-line algorithms are needed. Though object-space hidden-line algorithms are widely adopted for showing hidden-lines in distinctive styles, image-space algorithms have the advantages of rendering speed and processable shapes for their simplicity. This thesis develops a new image-space algorithm based on the traditional Z-Buffer algorithm to recover the information loss caused by hidden-line removal. This D-Buffer algorithm improves the Z-Buffer algorithm by drawing the hidden-lines in dotted or dashed style rather than removing them, hence retrieving the concealed information. Some image processing techniques, such as neighborhood operations, are used to generate the dotted or dashed lines. The D-Buffer algorithm is not only as efficient as other image-space algorithms, but is also capable of disclosing more inner structure information {{for a wide range}} of three-dimensional objects...|$|R

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award {{of the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Three-dimensional appearance models represent an essential outcome of industrial design practice, facilitating the origination, evaluation and specification of exterior form. As manufacturers face increasing pressure to reduce time scales for new product development, the production of such models using conventional fabrication techniques must be appraised. As a means of economically translating digital geometry into one-off components, rapid prototyping has the potential to contribute towards a reduction in lead times for the production of appearance models. The objective of this research is to propose a methodological approach for the effective integration of rapid prototyping within industrial design practice. The field and practice of industrial design is defined, the technology of rapid prototyping discussed, and their integration proposed through a <b>draft</b> <b>computer-aided</b> industrial design/rapid prototyping (CAID/RP) methodological approach. This is exposed to practitioner feedback, modified, and employed as a revised CAID/RP methodological approach during the industrial design of a nylon line trimmer. The product outcome is used to compare and contrast the production of an appearance model via rapid prototyping, an appearance prototype via rapid prototyping, and an appearance model via conventional fabrication techniques. Two issues arise from the use of the revised CAID/RP methodological approach: the production of stl files and the lack of physical interaction with product form. In addition, the emergence of rapid prototype sketch modelling systems following the line trimmer case study provides an opportunity for further enhancement. A strategy for the resolution of these issues is proposed, and their effectiveness evaluated through additional case studies. The resulting CAID/RP methodological approach is subject to validation through practitioner interviews and a normalised rating/weighting method. The positive feedback acknowledges the significance of the CAID/RP methodological approach through a reduction in product development lead times and enhancement of professional practice. The project makes a contribution to new knowledge and understanding in the area of professional practice through the definition and validation of operational paradigmatic change...|$|R
