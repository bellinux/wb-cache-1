60|$|It lasted several days, and the Shasta stopped {{only twice}} at sea: once to cool a <b>crank-pin,</b> and {{again for a}} longer while because there was {{something}} wrong with her condenser. In due time she crept into a deep, mountain-walled inlet where the little white Sorata lay, and Jimmy gazed in astonishment when he saw the piled-up produce on the strip of shingle beach between still, green water and climbing forest. He was even more astonished when certain bronzed men in battered wide hats and soil-stained jean came off, and conveyed him almost by force to the rude banquet laid out in a little frame hotel. Hitherto they had hauled the few goods they put on the market rather more than eight leagues along an infamous trail which for a part of that distance led over a mountain range.|$|E
50|$|These {{locomotives}} {{were the}} first in South Africa to be equipped with compensated spring gear on all coupled wheels. Their coupling rods extended from <b>crank-pin</b> to <b>crank-pin,</b> with no knuckle joints. The 5 ft wheelbase bogie had a lateral traverse of 1+1/4 in to each side, which was restrained by two cylindrically-shaped rubber cushion pads, each 5+5/8 in in diameter and 5 in deep. Two inverted laminated springs carried the vertical load.|$|E
5000|$|Usually, {{each pair}} of {{corresponding}} pistons from each bank of cylinders share one crankpin on the crankshaft, either by master/slave rods or by two ordinary connecting rods side by side. However, some V-twin engine designs have two-pin cranks, while other V configurations include split <b>crank-pins</b> for more even firing.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was thoroughly}} modern in design, with a one-piece cast steel frame with Franklin spring-loaded wedge horns, manufactured by Commonwealth Steel Castings Corporation in the United States of America. Like the Class 25 locomotive, it had roller bearing axle boxes on all wheels, {{but not on}} the <b>crank-pins,</b> with cannon boxes on all axles, except those of the inner Bissel trucks which had outside bearings. It had mechanical lubrication throughout, self-adjusting pivots, a U-shaped foundation ring welded to the inner and outer firebox bottom edges, and an all-welded firebox. The engine units also had Commonwealth cast steel type frames.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{units were}} {{identical}} {{to those of the}} Class GMA, except that the cylinders were lined and sleeved to reduce the bore from 20+1/2 to 18+1/2 in to suit the smaller boiler. This resulted in a correspondingly reduced tractive effort, from 60700 to 49430 lbf kN at 75% of boiler pressure. It also had roller bearing axle boxes on all wheels, but not on the <b>crank-pins,</b> with cannon boxes on all axles, except those of the inner Bissel trucks which had outside bearings. It had mechanical lubrication throughout, self-adjusting pivots, a U-shaped foundation ring welded to the inner and outer firebox bottom edges, and an all-welded firebox. The engine units also had Commonwealth cast steel type frames..|$|R
50|$|The {{steam engine}} {{cross-head}} sliding surface provides {{the reaction to}} the connecting rod force on the <b>crank-pin</b> and varies between zero and a maximum twice during each revolution of the crankshaft.|$|E
50|$|They {{were very}} {{powerful}} three-cylinder locomotives. At the time, three-cylindered locomotives were {{being built in}} appreciable numbers in Europe and America. Factors in their favour were their more even turning moment, improved balancing and better distribution of <b>crank-pin</b> thrust. Drawbacks were increased complexity and higher repair cost.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{relatively}} low power was divided among several cylinders, {{the running of the}} engines was particularly smooth, and the torque was very even. Adding to the smooth running of these engines was the use of the Canton-Unne system of planetary gears in a cage connecting pistons to <b>crank-pin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Several {{alterations}} {{were made}} to the locomotives by the IMR and CSAR. The original crank webs had solid <b>crank-pin</b> collars. New crank webs were fitted, which enabled solid bushed connecting and coupling rods to be fitted in place of the original split brass type. The original unbalanced slide valves were replaced with balanced slide valves.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} {{took place at the}} ex-GWR Swindon Works, along with the 2-6-0 tender engine version of the class.Although the boiler shared flanged plates with the GWR No.2 boiler the barrel was shortened by [...] inches and a dome added. Strangely they did not share the same design of wheels as the Doncaster-designed BR Standard Class 4 2-6-0 (76XXX), which also had 5 ft driving wheels and the same piston stoke, and hence <b>crank-pin</b> throw.|$|E
50|$|In a {{double-acting}} steam engine, {{as used in}} {{a railway}} locomotive, {{the direction of the}} vertical thrust on the slide bar is always upwards when running forward. It varies from nothing at the end of stroke to a maximum at half stroke when the angle between the con-rod and crank are greatest. When the <b>crank-pin</b> drives the piston, as when coasting, the piston thrust is downwards. The position of maximum thrust is shown by the increased wear at the middle of the slide bars.|$|E

5000|$|Possibly the {{earliest}} flat-six engined car was the Wilson-Pilcher car in 1900 (a flat-four version was also available). The engine was conventionally placed with the crankshaft in-line with the chassis and the cylinders between the chassis rails. Reports on this car quote {{it as being}} [...] "remarkably silent and smooth running" [...] and [...] "almost total absence of vibration". The car was produced by Wilson-Pilcher in London until 1904, then by Armstrong Whitworth & Co in Newcastle until c1907. The engine had equal bore and stroke of 95mm, and the cylinders were slightly offset so that each cylinder had its own <b>crank-pin,</b> with intermediate crankshaft bearings between each pair of cylinders. The engine was directly mounted to a 4-speed epicyclic gearbox employing helical gears in an oil bath, which was another reason for its quiet running.|$|E
40|$|Engine {{performance}} was investigated using a rectangular displacer on {{the piston crown}} to cause a forced air flow in a vertical-disk combustion chamber of a single-cylinder, 4 -stroke-cycle compression-ignition engine. The optimum air-flow area was determined first with the area concentrated {{at one end of}} the displacer and then with the area equally divided between two passages, one at each end of the displacer. Best {{performance was}} obtained with the two-passage air flow arranged to give a calculated maximum air-flow speed of 8 times the linear <b>crank-pin</b> speed. With the same fuel-spray formation as used without the air flow, the maximum clear exhaust brake mean effective pressure at 1, 500 r. p. m. was increased from 90 to 115 pounds per square inch and the corresponding fuel consumption reduced from 0. 46 to 0. 43 pound per brake horsepower-hour. At 1, 200 r. p. m., a maximum clear exhaust brake mean effective pressure of 120 pounds per square inch was obtained at a fuel consumption of 0. 42 pound per brake horsepower-hour. At higher specific fuel consumption the brake mean effective pressure was still increasing rapidly...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the kinematics formulation {{of an internal}} combustion engine crank mechanism. The kinematics formulation of the crank mechanism is done using vector loop method and cosine rule are applied to describe {{the position of the}} piston. Following the velocity of piston and connecting rod is performed by differentiating the position in terms of the crank angle and connecting rod angle respectively. The acceleration equation with brief form is derived from the velocity in the same principle. Based on the kinematics, the equations of motion of crank mechanism components are formulated for each moving link and platform then, all motion parameters of each component about its crank angle are readily derived. Furthermore the 2 D model is provided by using 2 D Auto CAD software in order to visualize the system and mathematical algorithm solved by using software MATLAB. The forces acting on the crank mechanism and the torque applied are also formulated based on the angles of the crank and connecting rod. Introduction. The Internal combustion engine is those that burn their fuel which is mixture of air and petrol from carburetor inside the cylinder or compress air only on the cylinder and injects diesel from injector nozzle. These IC engines convert the chemical energy stored in their fuel into heat energy during the power stroke of piston. The energy produced from burning of fuel is used for motion of piston; the working of a four stroke engine is based on simple slider crank mechanism. The kinematics of IC engine is not altering from simple slider crank mechanism. The kinematics formulation of the crank mechanism such as piston motion and connecting rod motion utilizes different software and methodologies for which it is suitable for manipulation The crank mechanism comprised of components like crank shaft, connecting rod and piston which changes the sudden displacement to a smooth rotary output which is the input to many devices such as pumps generators and compressors. A detailed procedure of getting stresses in the fillet area of a crank mechanism particularly crank shaft was introduced by Henry et al. [1], in which FEM and BEM (Boundary Element Method) were used. Obtained stresses were ratified by experimental results on turbocharged compression ignition engine with Ricardo type combustion chamber configuration. The crank mechanism durability assessment tool used in this study was developed by RENAULT Guagliano et al. [2] conducted a study on a marine diesel engine crankshaft and connecting rod. Payer et al. [3] developed a two-step technique to perform nonlinear transient analysis of crank mechanism combining a beam-mass model and a solid element model and Prakash et al. [4] performed stress and fatigue analysis on three example parts belonging to three different classes of engines, light automotive crankshaft was studied by Borges et al. [5]. The geometry of the crank mechanism was geometrically restricted due to limitations in the computer resources available to the authors. Shenoy and Fatemi [6] conducted dynamic analysis of loads in the connecting rod and piston components, which is in contact with the crankshaft. Dynamic analysis of the connecting rod is similar to dynamics of the crankshaft, since these components form a slide-crank mechanism and the connecting rod motion applies dynamic load on the <b>crank-pin</b> bearing [...] Shenoy and Fatemi [7] optimized the crank mechanism considering dynamic service load on the component. It was shown that dynamic analysis is the proper basis for fatigue performance calculation and optimization of dynamically loaded components. A literature survey by Zoroufi and Fatemi [8] focused on durability performance evaluation and comparisons of forged steel and cast iron crankshafts. The piston-connecting rod-crankshaft assembly in the reciprocating piston-engines is used to transform the gas forces generated during combustion within the working cylinder into a piston stroke, which the crankshafts converts into useful torque available at the flywheel. The cyclic operation leads to unequal gas forces, and the acceleration and deceleration of the reciprocating powe...|$|E
