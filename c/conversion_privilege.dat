40|$|Utilizing {{a random}} sample of 152 {{contracts}} that relate to public issues of debt and preferred shares made by Canadian firms over the period of 1978 to 1987, this thesis provides some empirical evidence on the use of accounting numbers in the contracting process. More specifically, it addresses three main research questions: (1) Does financial accounting play a contractual role? (2) Is it reasonable to use the debt/equity ratio as a proxy for 2 ̆ 2 closeness 2 ̆ 2 to breach a debt covenant? (3) Can we predict/explain the use of accounting numbers in the contracts under study?;It appears that accounting numbers are used in the contracting process but to a lesser extent than expected. In fact, a sharp decrease in the use of such numbers is observed in the more recently written contracts. The study also provides evidence which indicates that the use of accounting numbers in the contracting process is costly.;The definitions of the accounting numbers/ratios used in the sampled contracts are investigated in order to provide some evidence on the reasonability of using disclosed accounting numbers/ratios to proxy for 2 ̆ 2 closeness 2 ̆ 2 to breach a covenant. A special emphasis is placed on the debt/equity ratio because of the importance of this ratio in Positive Accounting Theory 2 ̆ 7 s research. The evidence presented in this thesis shows that no particular accounting number/ratio is extensively used in practice. In addition, the contractual terms used in actual covenants to define these accounting numbers/ratios vary greatly from one contract to another.;Only two variables appear to be significantly related to the use of accounting-based covenants in all the tests performed in the thesis: 2 ̆ 2 time 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 <b>conversion</b> <b>privilege</b> 2 ̆ 2 variables. The 2 ̆ 2 time 2 ̆ 2 variable represents the year in which a new contractual agreement was written. The 2 ̆ 2 <b>conversion</b> <b>privilege</b> 2 ̆ 2 variable indicates whether an issue under study is convertible into a participating issue or not. These two variables explain about one-third {{of the variance in the}} use of accounting-based covenants. They can also correctly predict the presence of such covenants in 77...|$|E
5000|$|Like bonds, {{preferred}} shares compensate owners with scheduled payments which resemble interest. However, preferred [...] "interest" [...] {{is actually in}} the form of a dividend. This is a significant accounting difference as preferred dividends, unlike debt interest, are charged after taxes and below net income, therefore reducing net income and ultimately earnings per share. Preferred shares may also contain <b>conversion</b> <b>privileges</b> which allow for their exchange into common stock.|$|R
50|$|Other notable {{changes made}} in the EGTRRA {{legislation}} were increasing the maximum deferral amount from the approximately $8,500 that was previously allowed to the same maximum elective deferral amount that 401(k) plans and now 403(b) plans allow, and easing restrictions on some plan rollovers. Governmental 457 plans may be rolled into other types of retirement plans with few restrictions beyond the normal ones for {{any other type of}} employer provided plan, which includes separation of service or disability. This includes other gastro-401(k) and 403(b) plans and also IRA's. IRA's have much greater flexibility in withdrawal and <b>conversion</b> <b>privileges.</b> In contrast, non-governmental 457 plans can only be rolled into another non-governmental 457 plan.|$|R
50|$|Brussels Airlines {{customers}} {{have been able}} to earn Miles & More benefits since 25 October 2009,when Brussels Airlines' previous frequent flyer programme, Privilege, ended and became Miles & More. There was a <b>conversion</b> of <b>Privilege</b> Gold members into Miles & More Frequent Travellers, while Privilege Platinum card holders became Miles & More Senators. Privilege miles were converted on a 1 to 1 basis.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{cross-sectional}} {{analysis of the}} relationship between common stock price reactions to announcements of convertible security calls and variables that represent possible determinants of changes in common stockholders' wealth. The variables are measures of the following effects of convertible security calls: (1) the change in interest expense tax shields, (2) the potential redistribution of wealth from common stockholders to preferred stockholders and debt holders,(3) the decrease in the value of <b>conversion</b> <b>privileges</b> heldby convertible security holders, (4) the relative increase in shares outstanding and (5) the change in earnings per share. A significant relationshipis found only between the measure of the reduction in interest expense tax shields and the stock price response to call announcements. The apparent corporate tax effect is consistent with some combination of effects due to (1) a reduction in interest expense tax shields and (2) unfavorable information about the calling firm's value of earnings prospects that is conveyed by a call of convertible securities. The evidence is consistent with theories of capital structure that imply optimal financial leverage depends on earnings prospects and with theories that imply reductions in leverage convey unfavorable information about firm value. ...|$|R
