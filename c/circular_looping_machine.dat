The presented method is easy to understand, numerically suitable and easily applicable for engineers and physicists.

Here we consider the corresponding question for global strings: can Goldstone boson emission prevent <b>circular</b> <b>loops</b> of global cosmic strings from forming black holes? Our results show that for every value of the string tension there is a certain critical size below which the <b>circular</b> <b>loop</b> does not collapse to form a black hole. For GUT scale strings, this critical size is much larger than the current horizon. Some years ago, Hawking 1 proved that a <b>circular</b> <b>loop</b> of gauge cosmic string would eventually collapse to form a black hole. Furthermore, he showed that in the process of collapse, the loop would radiate at most 29 % of its total energy in gravitational radiation before forming a black hole. The analysis Hawking gave used the singularity theorems of gravity and did not depend on the field theoretic details of the gauge string. In the present paper, we will consider a <b>circular</b> <b>loop</b> of global string. Here the loop primarily radiates Goldstone bosons during its collapse and the question arises if a black hole can eventually form. It is unfortunate that there are no corresponding singularity theorems that can give information about non-gravitational radiation and so we have t...|$|R

They identified a <b>circular</b> <b>looping</b> problem among the conflicting rules, even after reordering. The authors proposed resolving filters to break <b>circular</b> <b>loops</b> within the rules to solve the problem. The fast-detect algorithm is not suitable for five-tuple firewalls because it is only based on two-tuples, source and destination IP addresses.

To achieve a uniform traveling-wave current distribution, the loading reactance and the input impedances of the loaded and unloaded loop antennas need to satisfy certain relations from which the loading reactance can be predicted theoretically. It is shown that the <b>circular</b> <b>loop</b> antenna with uniform traveling-wave current distribution results in a lower profile, a more symmetrical circularly polarized radiation pattern, and a much better input impedance matching.

Due to its relative simplicity the study of the cylindrical dipole is quite complete, but owning to the degree of complexity, progress in the theory of the loop has been slower. In recent years the isolated <b>circular</b> <b>loop</b> antenna of arbitrary size {{has been the subject of}} mathematical and experimental analysis [7 [, [6]. It was not until 1970 that the first complete and general mathematical solution for the mutual admittance of two arbitrary size coaxial <b>circular</b> <b>loop</b> antennas was published. The problem was formulated by Adler in terms of coupled integral equations for the current distributions on the loops [1]. The equations were solved using the Fourier series representation of the current distributions. The study presented here is the next logical step beyond the work of Adler. Using his current equations the current distributions are calculated at each point around the two loops. The input admittance, electric field and power gains are calculated. Radiation patterns and the loop current distributions are plotted for two cases: (1) both loops driven and (2) one loop acting as a short circuited parasite. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

The results are particularly interesting in the domain of low frequency and high frequency Radio Frequency IDentification, where mutual influence of multiple reader antennas is often suppressed by means of a metallic shielding, which results in an important decrease of the readout distance and a detuning of every reader antenna. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A simple {{theory is}} {{presented}} to predict the lumped reactance loading for circularly polarized <b>circular</b> <b>loop</b> antennas with a uniform traveling-wave current distribution. The reactive load is located on a <b>circular</b> wire <b>loop</b> of one-wavelength circumference at a position of 45 away from the feed point. To achieve a uniform traveling-wave current distribution, the loading reactance and the input impedances of the loaded and unloaded loop antennas need to satisfy certain conditions. First, the input resistance and the input reactance of the unloaded loop antenna {{should have the same}} absolute value. Second, the input impedance of the loaded loop must be purely resistive and its value needs to be two times of the input resistance of the unloaded loop. Third, the loading reactance should be chosen to be two times in value and opposite in sense of the input reactance of the unloaded loop. These conditions can be approximately met when the <b>circular</b> <b>loop</b> is placed above a ground plane. The loading reactance is determined from the input impedance of the unloaded loop and is optimized for an optimal performance of circular polarization. It is found that the reactive load must be capacitive and its value depends on the height of the loop above the ground plane and the thickness of the wire. The characteristics of the circular polarization and the input impedance of the capacitance-loaded <b>circular</b> <b>loop</b> antennas are investigated. An experimental example {{is presented to}} verify the theoretical prediction.
