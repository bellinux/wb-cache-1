According to a 2007 analysis, Detroit officials noted that about 65 to 70 percent of homicides in the city were confined to a narcotics catalyst.

40|$|Context: According to Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, {{there is}} an {{increase}} in residential burglary crimes by 2 % in 2014 compared to 2013 and by 19 % in the past decade. Law enforcement agencies could only solve three to five percent of crimes reported in 2012. Multiple studies done in the field of <b>crime</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>report</b> that most of the residential burglaries are committed by relatively small number of offenders. Thus, the law enforcement agencies need toinvestigate the possibility of linking crimes into crime series. Objectives: This study presents the computation of a median crime which is the centre most crime in a crime series calculated using the statistical concept of median. This approach is used to calculate the uniqueness of a crime series consisting of linked residential burglaries. The burglaries are characterised using temporal, spatial features and modus operandi. Methods: Quasi experiment with repeated measures is chosen as research method. The burglaries are linked based on their characteristics(features) by building a statistical model using logistic regression algorithm to formulate estimated crime series. The study uses median crime as an approach for computing the uniqueness of linked burglaries. The measure of uniqueness is compared between estimated series and legally verified known series. In addition, the study compares the uniqueness of estimated and known series to randomly selected crimes. The measure of uniqueness is used to know the feasibility of using the formulated estimated series for investigation by the law bodies. Results: Statistical model built for linking crimes achieved an AUC = 0. 964,R 2 = 0. 770 and Dxy = 0. 900 during internal evaluation and achieved AU C = 0. 916 for predictions on test data set and AUC = 0. 85 for predictions on known series data set. The uniqueness measure of estimated series ranges from 0. 526 to 0. 715, and from 0. 359 to 0. 442 for known series corresponding to differentseries. The uniqueness of randomly selected crimes ranges from 0. 522 to 0. 726 for estimated series and from 0. 636 to 0. 743 for known series. The values obtained are analysed and evaluated using Independent two sample t-test, Cohen’s d and kolmogorov-smirnov test. From this analysis, it is evident that the uniqueness measure for estimated series is high compared to the known series and closely matches with randomly selected crimes. The uniqueness of known series is clearly low compared to both the estimated series and randomly selected crimes. Conclusion: The present study concludes that estimated series formulated using the statistical model has high uniqueness measures and needs to be furtherfiltered to be used by the law bodies...|$|R

Generally they collect domestic and foreign crime related data (intelligence) to prevent future attacks and utilize a limited number of law enforcement resources in an optimum manner. A major challenge faced by most of the law enforcement and intelligence organizations is efficiently and accurately analyzing the growing volumes of crime related data.

40|$|The public {{right to}} know is of {{particular}} significance when considering the reporting of crime and criminal justice. The internet has demonstrated strong influences upon crime reporting in mainstream media, including the range of material it provides to audiences. In addition, the internet has exposed journalists to new legal and ethical ramifications that accompany reportage on an international scale and, {{while it may be}} 2 ̆ 7 giving the people what they want 2 ̆ 7, it has also exacerbated the controversy surrounding the perennial question of how much the public has a {{right to know}}. Research suggests that giving online readers what they want in the context of crime reporting includes the transition to shorter, more concise stories at first point of access, with further background and detail available through links to multi-media facilities. Often these offer far more graphic detail and specificity than is available in mainstream media, bringing the audience closer {{to the scene of the}} crime and the people involved. This is reopening the argument of the right to know versus the desire for privacy. These developments raise questions about the level of gatekeeping that is applied to internet coverage of <b>crime.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of media <b>reporting</b> on the disappearance in May 2007 of British toddler Madeleine McCann has shown how online access has raised an increasing number of ethical and legal issues relevant to the question of whether giving audiences what they want can conflict with what the public have a right to know.

40|$|Geographic <b>crime</b> linkage <b>analysis</b> {{focuses on}} {{identifying}} spatially grouped serial crimes and criminals from a given {{a set of}} crime reports and other related information provided by state {{and local law enforcement}} agencies. Discovering and tracking spatial relationships from crime data is an important problem in <b>crime</b> <b>analysis</b> e. g. identifying relationships that exist among crimes committed by the same offender (e. g. serial killer) or same group of offenders (e. g. organized crimes). However, geographic <b>crime</b> linkage <b>analysis</b> is challenging due to several reasons: i) existense of disparate sources of data in the form of incident reports, dispatch records and modus operandi information (ii) crime data might have spatially skewed ditributions (iii) size, volume and complexity of data available to the law enforcement agencies is growing (iv) high risk of generating spurious patterns and (v) presence of large amounts of missing or imprecise data. Existing work in <b>crime</b> <b>analysis</b> assume a normal distribution of crime datasets and do not consider micro-environmental factors into account. Also, they focus on manual discovery of spatially grouped crimes whose results might be analyst-oriented, dependent on the underlying distribution of the data.
