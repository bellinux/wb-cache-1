50|$|Chape has had various {{meanings}} in English, but the predominant {{one is a}} protective fitting {{at the bottom of}} a scabbard or sheath for a sword or dagger (10 in the diagram). Historic blade weapons often had leather scabbards with metal fittings at either end, sometimes decorated. These are generally either in some sort of U shape, protecting the edges only, or a pocket <b>shape</b> <b>covering</b> the sides of the scabbard as well. The reinforced end of a single-piece metal scabbard can also be called the chape.|$|R
