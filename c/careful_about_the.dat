At {{the beginning of the}} third season, executive producer and co-creator David Hoberman said the staff felt {{it was a good idea}} to explore Trudy's death. They were, however, <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> manner in which they mentioned her death and Monk's desire to find the culprit.

[...] Co-producer and co-screenwriter Roberto Orci addressed the issue of the casting saying, [...] "Basically, as we went through the casting process and we began honing in on the themes of the movie, it became uncomfortable for me to support demonizing anyone of color, particularly any one of Middle Eastern descent or anyone evoking that.

In particular, there exist smooth varieties [...] {{which are not}} birational to any smooth variety [...] with nef canonical class.

2500|$|Bountys log {{shows that}} Bligh resorted to punishments {{relatively}} sparingly. He scolded when other captains would have whipped, and whipped when other captains would have hanged.

He took a great interest in his crew's exercise, was very <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> quality of their food, and insisted upon the Bountys being kept very clean. He tried (unsuccessfully) to check the spread of venereal disease among the men. The modern historian John Beaglehole has described the major flaw in this otherwise enlightened naval officer: [...] " [...] dogmatic judgements which he felt himself entitled to make; he saw fools about him too easily ... thin-skinned vanity was his curse through life ... never learnt that you do not make friends of men by insulting them." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s the {{prominent}} author and scholar Lu Xun prepared {{an anthology of}} Tang and Song chuanqi {{which was the first}} modern critical edition of the texts and helped to establish [...] "chuanqi" [...] as the term by which they are known, though later scholars have argued that it is not {{to be used as a}} general term for all Tang dynasty stories. The scholars Wilt Idema and Lloyd Haft, however, see [...] "chuánqí" [...] as a general term for short stories written in classical Chinese during the Tang and Song dynasties (excluding Bianwen Buddhist tales written in the colloquial). These stories consisted of anecdotes, jokes, legends, and tales involving mystical, fantastical or legendary elements. The authors, they continue, did not want to present their works as fiction, but modeled themselves on the literary style of the biographies in the official histories. They went so far as to credit specific people as authorities for the story, however fantastic, and give particular times and places as settings. The authors of these tales were also more <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> art of storytelling than authors of earlier works, and a number of them have well developed plots.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{leaflets}} {{were seen}} as being an effective tactic in manipulating troops when morale was low, [...] "During {{the early months of}} the war, leaflets or pamphlets were scattered over enemy territory by aircraft and balloons {{but it was more than}} doubtful whether these had any useful effect, their obvious defects being that few can have reached their targets and, being printed, they were sometimes out of date by the time they were ready to distribute. The front-line distribution of leaflets was quite another matter and these were dropped by aircraft or fired by shells, the messages they bore being less <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> general principles of consistency and frankness and only truthful about matters on which the enemy had contradictory information". It was found that psychological warfare was not effective when distributing surrender leaflets to an enemy which currently had a high morale amongst its troops. Despite the pitfalls to airborne leaflets ineffectiveness on opposing sides with high morale, enemies used this tactic [...] "to cause the men to begin talking to each other about their poor military position, their desire to stay alive for their families' sakes, and the reasonableness of honorable surrender", which often led men to desert their troops.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{concerns}} to the contrary, Glasberg denied that Ziva [...] "friend zoned" [...] Tony in the finale. He explained, [...] "It might not satisfy everyone out there, but I think we're getting there — she even reaches {{up with her}} hand and puts it very gently, and in a lovely way, on his shoulder before that kiss happens. I think there are gestures being made that have definitely advanced from where we were a year ago." [...] In response to complaints about {{the pace of the}} development, he said, [...] "There are a lot of fans {{who would like to see}} that story advance much faster than we're doing it, but I firmly believe a little goes a long way and there are ways to tease it and to flirt that are just as significant and just as meaningful." [...] He maintained, [...] "We made huge strides. Their relationship has evolved, has changed. They're a little more open with each other and a little more emotionally connected, certainly more than where we were at the beginning of the season. [...] may not be the big leap that a lot of people would like it to be, but I also feel like we're enjoying the pace at which this is happening. That's not to say we're not headed in the direction everyone would like to go, but I think we’re getting there. It's very complicated when two agents who are working together get into a relationship, and that's something that [...] would be very conscious of. So I think they would tread lightly, which is why, in theory, we're treading lightly and being very <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> steps that we take." ...|$|E
