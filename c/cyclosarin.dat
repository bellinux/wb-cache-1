25|$|During the Iran–Iraq War of 1980 to 1988, Iraq {{employed}} {{quantities of}} chemical weapons against Iranian ground forces. Although {{the most commonly used}} agents were mustard gas and sarin, tabun and <b>cyclosarin</b> were also used.|$|E
25|$|Tabun or GA is an {{extremely}} toxic chemical substance. It is a clear, colorless, and tasteless liquid with a faint fruity odor. It is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the mammalian nervous system. Its production is strictly controlled and stockpiling outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. Tabun {{is the first of}} the G-series nerve agents along with GB (sarin), GD (soman) and GF (<b>cyclosarin).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclosarin</b> (GF) also {{demonstrates}} greater toxicity than sarin (GB) in humans. Sarin has {{a median}} lethal dose (LD50) of 5 mg (for a 70 kg human), while GF has an LD50 of 1.2 mg. The median lethal concentration and time (LCt50) of <b>cyclosarin</b> is 50 mg⋅min/m3, which is half that of GB.|$|E
50|$|Like other nerve agents, <b>cyclosarin</b> can {{be shipped}} in binary munitions.|$|E
50|$|At room temperature, <b>cyclosarin</b> is a colorless liquid whose odor {{has been}} {{variously}} described as sweet and musty, or resembling peaches or shellac. Unlike sarin, <b>cyclosarin</b> is a persistent liquid, {{meaning that it}} has a low vapor pressure and therefore evaporates relatively slowly, about 69 times slower than sarin and 20 times slower than water.|$|E
50|$|Also unlike sarin, <b>cyclosarin</b> is flammable, with a {{flash point}} of 94 °C (201 °F).|$|E
5000|$|Chuck flashes on the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} <b>cyclosarin</b> gas displayed on one of Castle's monitors.|$|E
50|$|To date, Iraq is {{the only}} nation known to have {{manufactured}} significant quantities of <b>cyclosarin</b> {{for use as a}} chemical agent and to deploy it in battle. During the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988), the Iraqis used sarin and <b>cyclosarin</b> together as a mixture. This was likely done to obtain a more persistent chemical agent as well as in response to an existing embargo placed on alcohol precursors for sarin.|$|E
50|$|Nerve agents (specifically, tabun, sarin, and <b>cyclosarin)</b> and blister agents (specifically, sulfur-mustard and lewisite) were {{detected}} at Iraqi sites.|$|E
50|$|Like its {{predecessor}} sarin, <b>cyclosarin</b> is a liquid organophosphate nerve agent. Its physical characteristics are, however, {{quite different from}} sarin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cyclosarin</b> {{was central}} to {{the plot of the}} {{television}} episode [...] "Chuck Versus the Mask" [...] (Chuck, season 3, episode 7).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cyclosarin</b> {{is a real}} {{nerve agent}} {{developed}} for use in chemical warfare. However under the room-temperature conditions of Castle's lab, it naturally exists in a liquid state, not as a gas. The container {{in which it was}} shipped would require some specialized means of dispersing it in a gaseous state in the manner depicted in the episode. <b>Cyclosarin</b> also possesses a distinct, sweet odor which would have made Chuck and Casey's deception with a smoke grenade difficult.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cyclosarin</b> {{binary weapon}} {{would most likely}} contain methylphosphonyl difluoride in one capsule, with the other capsule {{containing}} either cyclohexanol or a mixture of cyclohexylamine and cyclohexanol.|$|E
50|$|The fourth G-series nerve agent, <b>cyclosarin,</b> {{although}} {{discovered by}} German scientists studying organophosphates during WWII, was seemingly not {{found by the}} Allies, but independently rediscovered in 1949.|$|E
50|$|Iraq fielded munitions {{filled with}} a mixture of GB (sarin) and GF (<b>cyclosarin).</b> Tests on mice {{indicated}} that GB-GF mixtures have a relative toxicity between GF and GB.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclosarin</b> or GF (cyclohexyl methylphosphonofluoridate) is an {{extremely}} toxic substance used as a chemical weapon. It {{is a member of}} the G-series family of nerve agents, a group of chemical weapons discovered and synthesized by a German team led by Dr. Gerhard Schrader. The major nerve gases are the G agents, sarin (GB), soman (GD), tabun (GA), and the V agents such as VX. The original agent, tabun, was discovered in Germany in 1936 in the process of work on organophosphorus insecticides. Next came sarin, soman and finally the most toxic, <b>cyclosarin,</b> a product of commercial insecticide laboratories prior to World War II.|$|E
50|$|During the Iran-Iraq War of 1980 to 1988, Iraq {{employed}} {{quantities of}} chemical weapons against Iranian ground forces. Although {{the most commonly used}} agents were mustard gas and sarin, tabun and <b>cyclosarin</b> were also used.|$|E
50|$|Sarin was {{discovered}} by Schrader and his team in 1938 and named after their initials: Schrader, Ambrose, Rüdiger and van der Linde. It was codenamed T-144 or Trilon-46. It {{was found to be}} more than ten times as potent as tabun. Soman {{was discovered}} by Richard Kuhn in 1944 as he worked with the existing compounds, the name is derived from either the Greek 'to sleep' or the Latin 'to bludgeon', it was codenamed T-300. <b>Cyclosarin</b> was also discovered during WWII but the details were lost and it was 'discovered' again in 1949. The G-series naming system was created by the United States when it uncovered the German activities, labeling tabun as GA (German Agent A), sarin as GB and soman as GD. Ethyl sarin was tagged GE and <b>cyclosarin</b> as GF.|$|E
50|$|It is a volatile, corrosive, and colorless liquid {{with a faint}} odor when pure. More commonly, it is {{a yellow}} to brown color and has a strong odor {{described}} as similar to camphor. The LCt50 for soman is 70 mg·min/m3 in humans. It is both more lethal and more persistent than sarin or tabun, but less so than <b>cyclosarin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|OPAA’s susbstrate-specificity to organophosphorus-containing compounds, {{especially}} fluoride-containing G-type nerve agents such as sarin, <b>cyclosarin,</b> tabun, and soman, {{have drawn}} {{the interest of}} the U.S. Army [...] That attention has resulted in the establishment of a biodegradation program in search of safe and effective means of disposal for chemical weapons in the 1980s; the program is currently called the Advanced Catalytic Enzyme System (ACES).|$|E
50|$|This {{series is}} the first and oldest family of nerve agents. The first nerve agent ever {{synthesised}} was GA (tabun) in 1936. GB (sarin) was discovered next in 1939, followed by GD (soman) in 1944, and finally the more obscure GF (<b>cyclosarin)</b> in 1949. GB was the only G agent that was fielded by the US as a munition, in rockets, aerial bombs, and artillery shells.|$|E
50|$|First {{synthesized}} during World War II {{as part of}} Nazi Germany's {{chemical weapons}} research on organophosphate compounds after their military potential was discovered, <b>cyclosarin</b> was also studied later in the United States and Great Britain in the early 1950s {{as part of a}} systematic study of potential nerve agents. It was never selected for mass production, however, due to its precursors being more expensive than those of other G-series nerve agents such as sarin (GB).|$|E
50|$|Tabun or GA is an {{extremely}} toxic chemical substance. It is a clear, colorless, and tasteless liquid with a faint fruity odor. It is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the mammalian nervous system.

5000|$|In [...] "Chuck Versus the Mask", Shaw begins {{expressing a}} romantic {{interest}} in Sarah, which she initially and strongly rejects. Shaw attempts {{to deny that}} he is making advances until, when exposed to <b>cyclosarin</b> gas, he acknowledges that he had actually been approaching her. Sarah admits that she overreacted, and somewhat enjoyed his advances. By the end of [...] "Chuck Versus the Fake Name" [...] Sarah returns his affection and they begin a relationship.|$|E
50|$|Baiji was {{captured}} {{with little or}} no fighting during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It was briefly thought in late April 2003 that barrels of chemicals found in a storage area near the town contained the nerve agent <b>cyclosarin.</b> Soon afterwards, United States troops discovered an underground oil refinery at Baiji which was initially suspected to be a chemical weapons plant. Both leads eventually proved to be false alarms in the search for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{not known}} at the time, but {{destruction}} of ordnance at Khamisiya {{is thought to have}} consequently released nerve agents such as sarin and <b>cyclosarin</b> into the atmosphere. Computer-generated models based on atmospheric conditions project that clouds of nerve agents would have drifted south and reached allied troops. [...] Records also show that Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) sensors monitoring the air soon reported traces of nerve agents. These NBC detection units were military units of several allied countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Poland.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2004, Polish troops {{also found}} {{evidence}} of degraded chemical weapons when they discovered insurgents trying to purchase <b>cyclosarin</b> gas warheads produced during the Iran-Iraq war. In their efforts to thwart insurgents acquiring these weapons, Polish troops purchased two rockets on June 23, 2004. The U.S. military later determined that the two rockets had only trace elements of sarin that were so small and deteriorated as to be virtually harmless and would have [...] "limited to no impact if used by insurgents against coalition forces".|$|E
50|$|Soman, or GD (systematic name: O-Pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate), is an {{extremely}} toxic chemical substance. It is a nerve agent, interfering with normal functioning of the mammalian nervous system by inhibiting the enzyme cholinesterase. It is an inhibitor of both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. As a chemical weapon, it is classified as {{a weapon of mass}} destruction by the United Nations according to UN Resolution 687. Its production is strictly controlled, and stockpiling is outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993 where it is classified as a Schedule 1 substance. Soman was the third of the so-called G-series nerve agents to be discovered along with GA (tabun), GB (sarin), and GF (<b>cyclosarin).</b>|$|E
50|$|Shaw begins {{hitting on}} Sarah, first by {{bringing}} her {{coffee and a}} swizzle stick, noticing that she chews on them, and later at the party by making advances, ostensibly for cover. Sarah later confronts him over this and demands he back off, although Shaw denies it. Later, while under {{the effects of the}} <b>cyclosarin,</b> Shaw admits that he was indeed coming on to her, and Sarah admits that she somewhat enjoyed it. Sarah nearly succumbs to the gas and Shaw carries her to the museum where the counter agent is administered. Later, Chuck and Sarah agree that it is ok for them to pursue other relationships. That night at Castle, Shaw and Sarah stay behind after Chuck and Casey leave. Sarah notes that what they're doing is dangerous, but Shaw reassures her he's safe.|$|E
5000|$|Hannah (Kristin Kreuk) is a {{civilian}} woman Chuck meets {{on a flight}} to Paris for his first solo mission. She is returning to Paris to clean out her office after having been let go and subsequently takes up Chuck's offer to join the Nerd Herd. Chuck's efforts to train her are repeatedly frustrated by his current mission. Hannah herself is unknowingly caught up in another operation during her first Nerd Herd service call; after Chuck's team steals a mask of Alexander the Great, a Ring operative uses her as bait to force Chuck to return the mask, and the <b>cyclosarin</b> gas being smuggled within. Afterwards, she and Chuck begin a relationship, but Chuck breaks up with her {{to protect her from}} the lies he would have to tell her as part of his double life. Hannah believes he lied so he could sleep with her and subsequently quits the store. First seen in [...] "Chuck Versus First Class".|$|E
5000|$|Team Bartowski's new leader, Daniel Shaw, began romantically {{approaching}} Sarah in [...] "Chuck Versus the Mask." [...] Although initially Sarah very vocally rejected his advances, {{when she}} and Shaw were exposed to <b>cyclosarin</b> gas Sarah admitted that she overreacted and somewhat enjoyed Shaw's attention. Sarah and Chuck agreed that they were free to pursue relationships with other people, and Sarah began allowing Shaw to get closer. In [...] "Chuck Versus the Fake Name", Sarah tells Shaw that this job is making her slowly forget who she was before and says {{that for the last}} three years, she has never once told anybody her real name. When Shaw asks her what it is, Sarah reveals that her real name is Sam (most likely from Samantha). Chuck also finds out her real name after he overhears this conversation while posing as an assassin the Ring hired to kill Shaw. She is still initially reluctant to allow herself to become involved with him, {{but by the end of}} the episode relents.|$|E
50|$|Back at Castle, Sarah and Shaw {{inadvertently}} {{trigger the}} weapon, which fills the lab with a chemical identified as <b>cyclosarin</b> and forces a lockdown {{to prevent further}} outbreak. Chuck arrives to update Shaw and Sarah only to find them trapped, and flashes on the gas's chemical composition and discovers {{that there is a}} counter agent that will reverse the effects if used within an hour. Reasoning that Vassilis would not have moved the weapon without the counter agent, he calls in Casey to assist with swapping out a second fake. To force Vassilis to give them the counter agent as well as release Hannah, they rig it with a smoke grenade to simulate the effects of the gas. At the museum, Chuck confronts Vassilis and smashes the mask and triggers the grenade. In a panic, Vassilis reveals the counter agent is in one of the vases, but does not know which. Chuck flashes on the correct vase, smashes it over Vassilis's head, and gives the counter agent to Casey while he frees Hannah from the vault. Meanwhile, Shaw and Sarah have been released from containment, and arrive at the museum where the antidote is administered. Vassilis sees Shaw and slips away.|$|E
50|$|In a declassified 1991 report, the CIA {{estimated}} that Iran had suffered more than 50,000 casualties from Iraq's use of several chemical weapons, though current estimates {{are more than}} 100,000 as the long-term effects continue to cause casualties. The official CIA estimate {{did not include the}} civilian population contaminated in bordering towns or the children and relatives of veterans, many of whom have developed blood, lung and skin complications, according to the Organization for Veterans of Iran. According to a 2002 article in the Star-Ledger, 20,000 Iranian soldiers were killed on the spot by nerve gas. As of 2002, 5,000 of the 80,000 survivors continue to seek regular medical treatment, while 1,000 are hospital inpatients.According to Iraqi documents, assistance in developing chemical weapons was obtained from firms in many countries, including the United States, West Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and France. A report stated that Dutch, Australian, Italian, French and both West and East German companies were involved in the export of raw materials to Iraqi chemical weapons factories. Declassified CIA documents show that the United States was providing reconnaissance intelligence to Iraq around 1987-88 which was then used to launch chemical weapon attacks on Iranian troops and that CIA fully knew that chemical weapons would be deployed and sarin and <b>cyclosarin</b> attacks followed.|$|E
5000|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Calvin [...] "WRAITH" [...] Hopper leading a SEAL team in a covert {{operation}} {{in a matter of}} national security to track down and interrogate former KGB agent, Vasyli Gozorov, who is believed to be withholding information on a forthcoming attack with weapons of mass destruction. His team members are TORO, who has just graduated BUD/S training and is new to the team, who is in the Able element, and the Bravo element which are SANDMAN, his past commander, and RAVEN. After breaching Gozorov's office in the fictional country of Koratvia, they discover a weapons cache and after being ambushed by a RPG blast, WRAITH commands everybody to take the submachine guns in the weapons cache. After finding an injured KRA gunman, the team questions him and he proceeds to tell the team that he is from the Koratvian Revolutionary Army but says nothing more other than where they were stationed in.The team heads for the KRA outpost only to find out that there is a large stash of weapons caches, and a hostage which identifies himself as DeBruyn, a member of the private military contractor (PMC) Talon International, and reveals that the KRA are attempting to eliminate them because of something that their boss said. WRAITH and his team then arrive at the PMC headquarters, while combat is still in place. In the last cutscene that follows the mission, SANDMAN, {{and the rest of the}} team realizes that the person DeBruyn refers to as [...] "Rawlins" [...] was actually LONESTAR, a former SEAL. WRAITH continued on to ask about why is the KRA attempting to eliminate the PMCs, and LONESTAR replied that he discovered a chemical WMD of some kind, that his firm was asked to transport, but the request was declined, and that the KRA are going to kill them to keep the chemical weapons a secret. The team heads off to an old decommissioned missile base, as indicated by LONESTAR's intel, to where the chemical weapons would be located, to have it destroyed. Once they move into the building where the barrels are, TORO confirms that it's <b>cyclosarin</b> gas. But fortunately, the scientists knew what they were doing, and separated the gases into binary forms, making it easier to destroy. As the team head to extraction under fire, TORO discovers an opportunity to get at the buyer, but failed when an enemy tosses a stun grenade, and when the rest of the team recovers from the grenade, they see TORO being kidnapped, and loaded into a truck. WRAITH decides to trust LONESTAR, and WRAITH, RAVEN, SANDMAN, and LONESTAR head off to find TORO in an enemy held village in the mountains. After searching the entire village, they eventually find TORO in the ski lodge. As they leave the building, however, LONESTAR gets killed by a sniper. The team locates Gozorov in his estate and kill him after he refuses to surrender. They also find out that the KRA is targeting the president of Koratvia. After fighting their way into the Koratvian Independence Hall, They successfully rescue him, telling him to [...] "go somewhere safe" [...] and to forget about them. At the ending, WRAITH says he will treat all his men to a drink and a vacation.|$|E
40|$|The neuroprotective {{effects of}} newly {{developed}} oximes (K 156, K 203) and currently available oximes (obidoxime, HI- 6) {{in combination with}} atropine in rats poisoned with <b>cyclosarin</b> were studied. The cyclosarin-induced neurotoxicity was monitored using a functional observational battery 24 hours after <b>cyclosarin</b> challenge. The results indicate that a newly developed oxime K 156 is able to counteract slightly cyclosarin-induced neurotoxicity while another newly developed oxime K 203 is completely ineffective in reducing cyclosarin-induced neurotoxic signs and symptoms. The neuroprotective efficacy of K 156 is comparable with commonly used obidoxime and oxime HI- 6. Thus, none of the newly developed oximes achieves better neuroprotective efficacy than both commonly used oximes. They are therefore not suitable replacements for antidotal treatment of acute poisonings with <b>cyclosarin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Organophosphorus {{compounds}} {{ascribed to}} as nerve agents (sarin, soman, tabun, <b>cyclosarin)</b> are highly toxic, and {{are considered to}} be the most dangerous chemical compounds. All apparently share a common mechanism of cholinesterase inhibition and can cause similar svmotoms. The standard therapy, in the case of organophosphorus poisoning, has the prophylactic use of reversibly acting AChE inhibitors and antidotal administration of AChE reactivators-oximes. Unfortunately, none of these oximes can be regarded as a broad spectrum antidote, ie, effective against all nerve agents. While the presently available oximes (pralidoxime, ohidoxime) are not considered to be sufficiently effective against nerve agents, {{especially in the case of}} soman poisoning, the H oximes (HI- 6, HLo 7) appear to,be very promising antidotes against nerve agents because these are able to protect the experimental animals from toxic effects and improve survival of animals poisoned with supralethal doses. A lot of research has been pursued on the treatment of sarin, soman, and tabun, but <b>cyclosarin</b> was not considered for such a study for a long time. Recently, attention of researchers has also turned to <b>cyclosarin</b> because of its potential use as a chemical warfare agent. <b>Cyclosarin</b> is highly toxic organophosphorus compound which is resistant to conventional oxime therapy.
