40|$|Product {{conformity}} assessment system changes in various countries have impacted {{the role of}} <b>certification</b> <b>marks.</b> The author explores whether the perceived value of product <b>certification</b> <b>marks</b> can sustain their high costs. The author further emphasizes the need, from both economic and legal perspectives, for manufacturers to implement global compliance strategies to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, selection of proper <b>certification</b> <b>marks,</b> and an efficient path through the {{conformity assessment}} process...|$|R

50|$|For consumers, CSA International <b>certification</b> <b>marks</b> are {{intended}} to provide increased assurance of quality and safety. For manufacturers, international recognition of the mark may help to ease their entry into North American markets. CSA International <b>certification</b> <b>marks</b> are accepted by many North American regulators and by {{a large number of}} North American retailers. Billions of products bearing CSA International <b>certification</b> <b>marks</b> are found on the shelves of well-known retail chains and sold by major product distributors.|$|R
25|$|In 2002, FLO {{launched}} for {{the first}} time an International Fairtrade <b>Certification</b> <b>Mark.</b> The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade, and simplify procedures for both producers and importers. At present, the <b>certification</b> <b>mark</b> is used in over 50 countries and on dozens of different products, based on FLO's certification for coffee, tea, rice, bananas, mangoes, cocoa, cotton, sugar, honey, fruit juices, nuts, fresh fruit, quinoa, herbs and spices, wine, footballs, etc.|$|E
25|$|The Fairtrade {{certification}} system covers a growing range of products, including bananas, honey, coffee, oranges, Cocoa bean, cocoa, cotton, dried and {{fresh fruits and}} vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, quinoa, rice, spices, sugar, tea, and wine. Companies offering products that meet the Fairtrade standards may apply for licences {{to use one of}} the Fairtrade Certification Marks for those products. The International Fairtrade <b>Certification</b> <b>Mark</b> was launched in 2002 by FLO, and replaced twelve Marks used by various Fairtrade labelling initiatives. The new <b>Certification</b> <b>Mark</b> is currently used worldwide (with the exception of the United States). The Fair Trade Certified Mark is still used to identify Fairtrade goods in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Coffee packers pay Fairtrade {{a fee for}} {{the right}} to use the Fairtrade logo, which gives {{consumers}} an assurance that the coffee meets Fairtrade criteria. The coffee with this <b>certification</b> <b>mark</b> must be produced by farmers and cooperatives that meet these criteria.|$|E

25|$|More generally, a {{notified}} body is an independent, accredited body which is entitled by an authorized accrediting body. Upon definition of standards and regulations, the accrediting body may allow a {{notified body}} to provide verification and certification services.

25|$|An {{application}} was submitted {{in the name}} of the Harris Tweed Association Ltd for a standardisation mark, now known as a <b>certification</b> <b>mark,</b> affording much stronger protection that an ordinary trademark would. The trademark was applied for in February 1910 to the Board of Trade as Application No. 319214 under section 62 of the Trade Marks Act 1905 in Class 34 and was finally registered in October 1910.|$|E

25|$|Until the 1960s {{areas of}} concern were {{predominantly}} focussed on cloth claiming to be Harris Tweed that was not being woven at the islander's homes, tweed not being woven by hand, yarn being spun outside the Outer Hebrides, tweed being finished outside the Outer Hebrides, use of yarn that was not made from 100% Pure New Wool and the selling and marketing of Harris Tweed {{that had not been}} inspected or stamped with the Orb <b>certification</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fairtrade {{labelling}} (usually simply Fairtrade or Fair Trade Certified in the United States) is a {{certification system}} designed to allow consumers to identify goods which meet agreed standards. Overseen by a standard-setting body (FLO International) and a certification body (FLO-CERT), the system involves independent auditing of producers and traders to ensure the agreed standards are met. For a product to carry either the International Fairtrade <b>Certification</b> <b>Mark</b> or the Fair Trade Certified Mark, it must come from FLO-CERT inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested {{in accordance with the}} international Fair trade standards set by FLO International. The supply chain must also have been monitored by FLO-CERT, to ensure the integrity of the labelled product.|$|E
25|$|The FLO International (Fairtrade International), {{created in}} 1997, is an {{association}} of three producer networks and twenty national labeling initiatives that develop Fairtrade standards, license buyers, label usage and market the Fair trade <b>Certification</b> <b>Mark</b> in consuming countries. The Fairtrade International labeling system is {{the largest and most}} widely recognized standard setting and certification body for labeled Fair trade. Formerly named Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, it changed its name to Fairtrade International in 2009, when its producer certification and standard setting activities were separated into two separate, but connected entities. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Fairtrade International, the non-profit arm, oversees standards development and licensing organization activity. Only products from certain developing countries are eligible for certification, and for some products such as coffee and cocoa, certification is restricted to cooperatives. Cooperatives and large estates with hired labor may be certified for bananas, tea and other crops.|$|E

500|$|The Lim-Flex <b>certification</b> <b>mark</b> {{has been}} adopted in Australia and New Zealand, where [...] "commercial Lim-Flex must be 25 to 75 percent Limousin and 25 to 75 percent Angus or Red Angus", and in Canada, where they [...] "must be between 37.5 to 75 percent Limousin and 25 to 62.5 percent Angus or Red Angus, with a maximum {{allowance}} of another breed or unknown breed composition of 12.5 percent (1/8th)".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{manufacturers}} {{provide the}} percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of [...] "cocoa" [...] or [...] "cacao".

The Belgian AMBAO <b>certification</b> <b>mark</b> indicates that no non-cocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate.|$|E
2500|$|Every 58 metre and 75 metre {{length of}} Harris Tweed {{produced}} by the Harris Tweed mills is inspected by a Harris Tweed Authority inspector and [...] "stamped" [...] with an iron-on transfer of the Orb <b>certification</b> <b>mark</b> as outline above. Typically the mark is applied at the selvedge, one {{at the corner of}} each end and one at the half-way point. Customers may request additional marks to be applied at different points also.|$|E
50|$|<b>Certification</b> <b>marks</b> {{differ from}} {{collective}} trade marks. The main {{difference is that}} collective trade marks may be used by particular {{members of the organization}} which owns them, while <b>certification</b> <b>marks</b> are the only evidence of the existence of follow-up agreements between manufacturers and nationally accredited testing and certification organisations. Certification organizations charge for the use of their labels and are thus always aware of exact production numbers. In this way, certification organisations can be seen to earn a commission from sales of products under their follow-up regimes. In return, the use of the <b>certification</b> <b>marks</b> enables the product sales in the first place.|$|R

[...] To receive safety approvals, X and Y powerline-rated capacitors are destructively tested {{to the point of}} failure. Even when exposed to large overvoltage surges, these safety-rated capacitors must fail in a fail-safe manner that does not endanger personnel or property.|$|E
2500|$|FreeOTFE was {{initially}} released by Sarah Dean in 2004, {{and was the}} first open source code disk encryption system that provided a modular architecture allowing 3rd parties to implement additional algorithms if needed. Older FreeOTFE licensing required that any modification to the program be placed in the public domain. This does not conform technically to section 3 of the Open Source definition. Newer program licensing omits this condition. The FreeOTFE license has not been approved by the [...] and is not certified to be labeled with the open-source <b>certification</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In the United States {{there are}} {{groups that have}} some degree of {{protection}} for their regional designation. For example, Vidalia onions must be produced within a certain region around Vidalia, Georgia, {{as defined by the}} Georgia Department of Agriculture, and [...] "100% Florida orange juice" [...] is certified as being such by that state's Department of Citrus. Some of these marks are protected in the United States under <b>certification</b> <b>mark</b> law, such as the Idaho Potato Commission's [...] "Idaho" [...] and [...] "Grown in Idaho" [...] registered trademarks for potatoes. Tennessee whiskey is straight Bourbon Whiskey produced in the state of Tennessee. This definition is legally established under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which states that Tennessee whiskey is [...] "a straight Bourbon Whiskey authorised to be produced only in the State of Tennessee." [...] There also are cases in which a geographical name has been trademarked for a particular product that might not even be manufactured there, such as Philadelphia cream cheese. However, because the several states are limited in sovereignty under the United States Constitution, these types of laws are extremely limited in terms of enforcement, except {{to the extent that they}} are backed by various U.S. federal laws.|$|E
