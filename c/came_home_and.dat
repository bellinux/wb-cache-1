5|$|Wyatt Earp and Cochise County sheriff Johnny Behan were {{interested}} in the same sheriff's position and also may have shared an interest in the same woman, Josephine Marcus, known as Sadie. Citizens of Tombstone believed that Behan and Marcus were married, but Behan was a known womanizer and had sex with prostitutes and other women. Marcus ended the relationship after she <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> found Behan in bed with the wife of a friend and kicked him out, although she used the Behan surname through the end of that summer. She rented her home sometime before April 1881 to a doctor, George Goodfellow.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Adams {{decided not}} to seek reelection, but rather to {{challenge}} the popular incumbent U.S. Senator John G. Townsend, Jr. for his U.S. Senate seat. A thoughtful moderate Republican, Townsend had supported much of the New Deal legislation, and had demonstrated considerable effectiveness through {{his involvement in the}} establishment of such things as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. By contrast, Adams had a low profile in the House of Representatives and Townsend was able to raise questions about Adams' effectiveness for Delaware. Once again bucking national trends, Delaware had its own local Republican landslide in 1934, led by Townsend. Adams <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> moved to Georgetown, Delaware where he continued the practice of law. He was also the acting Postmaster at Georgetown, from May 6, 1937, until his death.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, John's wife Cynthia {{opened the door}} of Kenwood (their home in Weybridge) to see a man who [...] "looked like a tramp" [...] but, alarmingly, with John's face. Cynthia invited Alf in, and gave him tea and cheese on toast until John came home, which he was {{expected}} to do in an hour or so. While waiting, Cynthia offered to cut Alf's [...] "long, stringy locks" [...] of hair, which he allowed her to do. After waiting for a couple of hours, Alf left. John was annoyed when he <b>came</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> told Cynthia (for the first time) about Alf's visit to the NEMS office a few weeks earlier. Later he relented slightly and contacted Alf over the next few months, telling Cynthia [...] "Alright, Cyn. He's a bit 'wacky', like me." [...] After Christmas, in 1965, John was embarrassed to hear that Alf had made a record: [...] "That's My Life (My Love and My Home)", released on 31 December 1965. John asked Epstein to do anything he could to stop it being released or becoming a hit. The record never made it into the charts. In 1966 [...] "Freddie Lennon" [...] (the name under which Alf recorded) tried again, and issued three singles with the group Loving Kind. These records did not sell well, either. Though the public at large quickly forgot these attempts to cash in on his son's success with the Beatles, the records do command fairly high prices among collectors of rare records, with [...] "That's My Life" [...] being worth over £50.|$|E

He never made a break from his parents, but they rarely knew where he was. Sometimes he <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> his mother would have to sew $100 bills into the seams of his blue jeans. He disappeared in Nicaragua. His body was later identified as a dead Sandinista freedom fighter. From a nice little house surrounded by evergreens {{at the other end}} of Washington Street, he left to look for something he needed to find. I believe in Sean Penn's Christopher McCandless. I grew up with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, Richard James, a naval {{mechanical}} engineer {{stationed at the}} William Cramp and Sons shipyards in Philadelphia, was developing springs that could support and stabilize sensitive instruments aboard ships in rough seas. James accidentally knocked one of the springs from a shelf, {{and watched as the}} spring [...] "stepped" [...] in a series of arcs to a stack of books, to a tabletop, and to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. James's wife Betty later recalled, [...] "He <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> said, 'I think if I got the right property of steel and the right tension; I could make it walk.'" [...] James experimented with different types of steel wire over the next year, and finally found a spring that would walk. [...] Betty was dubious at first, but changed her mind after the toy was fine-tuned and neighborhood children expressed an excited interest in it. She dubbed the toy Slinky (meaning [...] "sleek and graceful"), after finding the word in a dictionary, and deciding that the word aptly described the sound of a metal spring expanding and collapsing.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the month the Cardinals were 2 games behind the Brewers in the standings. However, they lost two of three to Milwaukee on the road Aug. 1–3, then did the same at home on Aug. 9–11, giving the Brewers a four-game lead in the NL Central. The team continued to stumble as the Brewers continued to win. Newly acquired shortstop Furcal hit only [...]240 for the month. The Cardinals went 2–4 on a six-game road trip to Pittsburgh and Chicago, then <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> were swept in three games by a bad Dodger team. After close of business on August 24, the day the Dodgers completed their sweep, St. Louis had fallen ten games behind Milwaukee in the NL Central standings and 10 games behind the Atlanta Braves (and in third place) in the NL Wild Card standings. Manager Tony La Russa said on the struggles: [...] "I guarantee that the team you have seen the past few weeks is not the team we have, and I believe you will start to see our team tomorrow." [...] Chris Carpenter and other veterans called for a closed, player-only team meeting, which was held the day after the Dodgers series ended. St. Louis' odds of making the playoffs stood at 1.3%.|$|E
2500|$|Hoppus and {{his girlfriend}} at this time lived in a {{basement}} apartment, barely scraping together funds to pay rent. With money in savings, Hoppus {{went out and bought}} his first professional equipment: a new amp and bass cabinet. He <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> his girlfriend proceeded to argue with him, angry that he spent money on something they did not need. [...] "I just kept telling her that this was what mattered to me, this was my life," [...] Hoppus recalled. She demanded he make a choice between the band and her, which resulted in Hoppus leaving the band shortly after formation. Shortly thereafter, DeLonge told Hoppus he had borrowed a four track recorder from a friend and was preparing to record a demo tape, which prompted Hoppus to break up with his girlfriend and return to the band. Flyswatter—a combination of original songs and punk covers—was recorded in Raynor's bedroom and landed the band their first shows. Three more demos were recorded over the course of 1993 and the band began performing its irreverent live show at local all-ages venue SOMA, which alerted local independent label Cargo Music. Cargo signed the band on a trial basis, and Hoppus was the only member to sign the contract, as DeLonge was at work at the time and Raynor was still a minor. During this time, Hoppus lived at home in San Diego at his mother's, where the band would prepare cassette demos and the entire family would fold cassette inserts. Raynor, whose parents moved to Reno, Nevada, stayed with Hoppus in summer 1994.|$|E
2500|$|The poor 2009 {{record of}} Tampa Bay {{was in part}} due to a youthful, inexperienced team (barring a few {{exceptions}} such as 35-year-old CB Ronde Barber, the last remaining member of the 2002 Super Bowl team), and it was hoped that they would improve with time. The Buccaneers got off to a 2-0 start in 2010 by beating Cleveland and Carolina, but both were weak opponents and they proved unable to handle Pittsburgh, a team that was only two years removed from its 2008 Super Bowl win, losing 38-13. Following their bye week, they beat the Bengals in Cincinnati 24-21. [...] After the road victory in Cincinnati, the Bucs came home to face the defending Super Bowl champion Saints, who were struggling after a loss to the Arizona Cardinals in which the Cardinals did not score an offensive touchdown, but capitalized on New Orleans turnovers. [...] A victory would have helped the Bucs towards first place in the NFC South; however, they were blown out 31-6. [...] The next week saw another home deficit against the St. Louis Rams with the Bucs trailing 6-17 at halftime. [...] Strong defense shut down the Rams offense in the second half, and with two field goals and a late touchdown pass to Carnell [...] "Cadillac" [...] Williams, the Bucs topped the Rams 18-17. [...] After the game with the team standing at 4-2, head coach Raheem Morris would famously state, [...] "We're {{the best team in the}} NFC." [...] The following week, the Bucs would make good on Morris's claim by defeating the Arizona Cardinals on the road in a game where they led 31-14, [...] fell behind late 35-31, then retook the lead 38-35 and sealed the victory with an Aqib Talib interception of Cardinals quarterback Derek Anderson near the end zone. [...] With the Bucs and the Atlanta Falcons tied for first place in the division at 5-2, a matchup in Atlanta gave the Bucs a chance to take sole possession of first place. [...] Trailing 27-14 in the second half, Bucs returner Micheal Spurlock returned a Falcons kickoff for a touchdown to put the Bucs within a touchdown of the lead. [...] The game came down to fourth down attempt to score from the Falcons 1 yard-line. Rookie running back LeGarrette Blount was stopped up the middle and gave the Falcons the close victory. [...] Following the tough loss, the Bucs <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> defeated the Carolina Panthers 31-16 before going on the road against the San Francisco 49ers and pitching a 21-0 shutout. [...] The next week, the Bucs road game against the Baltimore Ravens, their fourth game away from Raymond James Stadium in five weeks, was moved to a late start, and the Bucs lost a hard-fought defensive struggle 17-10. [...] Finally returning home the next week, the team sported their throwback creamsicle uniforms and honored coach John McKay at halftime in a home contest against the Falcons on national television. [...] With a great defensive performance and two interceptions of Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, it seemed the Bucs would get revenge on the Falcons for their loss four weeks ago, leading 24-14 deep in the second half. [...] But Falcons returner Eric Weems returned a kick for a touchdown and the Falcons scored offensively to take a 28-24 lead. [...] Quarterback Josh Freeman attempted the late comeback as he had against the Browns, Bengals, Rams, and Cardinals, but was denied with a Brent Grimes interception. [...] At 7-5, the Bucs' playoff hopes seemed less assured, and the team had yet to defeat an opponent with a winning record, while several key starters had been lost for the season. [...] In a rainy outing at Washington, the Bucs prevailed 17-16 thanks to a botched extra-point attempt by the Redskins, but lost to the Detroit Lions at home in overtime to break the Lions' historic road losing streak. [...] Needing help to make the playoffs as a wild-card team, the Bucs routed the eventual NFC West champion Seattle Seahawks 38-15 in Tampa. [...] With the last week of the regular season on the slate, the Bucs needed to defeat the New Orleans Saints in the Superdome, then hope for the defeats of the Green Bay Packers and the New York Giants by the Chicago Bears and Washington Redskins, respectively, as both teams held playoff tiebreakers over the Buccaneers. [...] The Saints planned to fight the Bucs equally hard, as a victory and a Falcons loss to the Carolina Panthers would give them the #1 seed in the NFC. [...] The game was close and hard-fought throughout the first half, but two key turnovers by the Bucs defense, a Barrett Ruud forced fumble of Saints running back Julius Jones near the Bucs' goal line and an interception of Saints quarterback Drew Brees near the end of the half, gave the Bucs the slight edge. [...] A Saints field goal in the fourth quarter cut the Tampa Bay lead to 20-13, but with the Falcons holding a large lead over the Panthers, Saints coach Sean Payton chose to sit Brees and put in backup Chase Daniel. [...] The Bucs held on and won the game 23-13, finishing the season with a 10-6 record, their best since 2005. [...] However, the Packers and Giants both won close games as well, thus sending the eventual Super Bowl champion Packers to the playoffs. [...] For the second time in three years, the Bucs had finished with a winning record, yet missed the playoffs. [...] The season marked a 7-game improvement over the previous one, and was highlighted by the superb play of second-year quarterback Josh Freeman and a strong rookie class led by Gerald McCoy, Arrelious Benn, Mike Williams, Cody Grimm, and LeGarrette Blount. [...] No Buccaneers were selected to the Pro Bowl, but left tackle Donald Penn did play in the game as a replacement for Green Bay's Chad Clifton, marking Penn's first appearance. [...] Raheem Morris finished second in AP NFL Coach of the Year voting, and Mike Williams finished second in Offensive Rookie of the Year voting.|$|E
