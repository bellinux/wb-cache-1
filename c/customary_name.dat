Let each reader make what he will of her; fancy her of any outward shape and colour that he please, and endow her with any amount of divine beauty. But for her inner character, let him take that from me as I go on, if so be that I can succeed in making clear to others that which is clear enough to my own mind's eye. I have called her a heroine; it is the novelist's <b>customary</b> <b>name</b> for his prima donna, and so I use it. But many opera companies {{have more than one}} prima donna. There is the donna prima, and if one may so say, the donna primissima. Now Adela Guantlet is no more than my donna prima. My donna primissima will be another guess sort of lady altogether.|$|E

Surname and given name fields are not differentiated on the passport, and this can cause difficulties or confusion in some countries as the placement of the surname is not consistent.|$|R
5000|$|To avoid confusion, {{the names}} of the rural districts in these pairs are {{commonly}} rendered with the suffix -Land, in this context roughly meaning [...] "region." [...] The <b>customary</b> <b>name</b> for the city of Innsbruck is Innsbruck, the <b>customary</b> <b>name</b> for the district headed by the Innsbruck district commission is Innsbruck-Land. While this usage is nearly universal both in the media and in everyday spoken German and even appears in the occasional government publication, the suffix -Land is not part of any official, legal designation.|$|E

While razkovniche and raskovnik are the <b>customary</b> <b>names</b> in Bulgarian and Serbian respectively and the root is also preserved in the Leskovac dialect as raskov, {{in some parts of}} Macedonia it is known as ež trava ("hedgehog grass"). In the vicinity of Bar (southeastern Montenegro), the term is demir-bozan, a Turkish borrowing meaning [...] "iron breaker". In Syrmia, the plant is referred to as špirgasta trava (a hapax legomenon), in Slavonia it is known as zemaljski ključ ("earth key"), and in Slovenia's Savinja Valley as mavričin koren ("rainbow root").|$|R

50|$|Conventional {{middle to}} modern Black Isle history is well {{documented}} {{at a number of}} visitor centres and cottage museums sprinkled across the peninsula. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, it was originally called Ardmeanach (Gaelic ard, height; maniach, monk, from an old religious house on the wooded ridge of Mulbuie), and it derived its <b>customary</b> <b>name</b> from the fact that, since snow does not lie in winter, the promontory looks black while the surrounding country is white.|$|E

6000|$|I {{can only}} notice one other memorable place in Shrewsbury, {{and that is}} the Raven Inn, where Farquhar wrote his comedy of [...] "The Recruiting Officer" [...] in 1701. The window of the room in which he wrote is said to look into the inn yard, and I went through the arched {{entrance}} to see if I could distinguish it. The hostlers were currying horses in the yard, and so stared at me that I gave but the merest glance. The Shrewsbury inns have not only the <b>customary</b> <b>names</b> of English inns,--as the Lion, the Stag,--but they have also the carved wooden figures of the object named, whereas, in all other towns, the name alone remains.|$|R

5000|$|Since an {{embedding}} is compact if {{and only}} if the inclusion (identity) operator is a compact operator, the Rellich-Kondrachov theorem implies that any uniformly bounded sequence in W1,p(Ω; R) has a subsequence that converges in Lq(Ω; R). Stated in this form, in the past the result was sometimes referred to as the Rellich-Kondrachov selection theorem, since one [...] "selects" [...] a convergent subsequence. (However, today the <b>customary</b> <b>name</b> is [...] "compactness theorem", whereas [...] "selection theorem" [...] has a precise and quite different meaning, referring to multifunctions).|$|E

On the brook, many mills were once run; within {{municipal}} limits, the Kandelmühle (or Oligmühle), the Eselsmühle (“Ass’s Mill”) and the Gräfliche Leininger Mühle (“Comital Leiningen Mill”) are still {{more or less}} well preserved. The last was originally called the Kochsche Mühle; its <b>customary</b> <b>name</b> owes itself to its ownership history. In 1751 and 1752 it was owned by Countess Christiane Wilhelmine zu Leiningen, whom Carl Friedrich Wilhelm zu Leiningen, the first Leiningen to be raised to prince, had married in 1749.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1870s, {{a written}} {{agreement}} containing a {{pledge not to}} join a union was {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Infamous Document".

This anti-union pledge was also called an [...] "iron clad document", and from this time until the close of the 19th century [...] "iron-clad" [...] was the <b>customary</b> <b>name</b> for the non-union promise. Beginning with New York in 1887, sixteen states wrote on their statute books declarations making it a criminal act to force employees to agree not to join unions. The Congress of the United States incorporated in the Erdman Act of 1898 a provision relating to carriers engaged in interstate commerce.|$|E

In some cases foods can be described as cream although they do not contain predominantly milk fats; for example in Britain [...] "ice cream" [...] does not have to be a dairy product (although it must be labelled [...] "contains non-milk fat"), and salad cream is the <b>customary</b> <b>name</b> for a condiment that has been produced since the 1920s.|$|E

The nomenclature of the former is consistent with the <b>customary</b> <b>names</b> of the other two great protests that occurred in Tiananmen Square: the May Fourth Movement of 1919, and the April Fifth Movement of 1976. [...] "June Fourth" [...] refers to the day on which the People's Liberation Army cleared Tiananmen Square of protesters, although actual operations began on the evening of June 3. Names such as June Fourth Movement (...) and 89 Democracy Movement (...) are used to describe the event in its entirety.|$|R

A multi-meter measures voltage, current, and resistance. It is a <b>customary</b> <b>name</b> for {{an instrument that}} puts a voltmeter, an ammeter, and an ohmmeter together into one device. Initially, these instruments were analog, but digital multi-meters have been replacing analog meters for some time.

It displays anything between 4. 95 V to 5. 05 V if the accuracy is plusmn 1 % (10. 05 V). With the same accuracy and a four-digit multi-meter, the output is anything in the range of 4. 950 V to 5. 050 V. High-digit, high-accuracy multi-meters are more attractive, but expensive.
