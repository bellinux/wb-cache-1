40|$|The {{performance}} of a Stirling cryocooler is governed by six principal design parameters, namely speed, pressure limits, {{the temperature of the}} working fluid in the <b>compression</b> and expansion <b>spaces,</b> the ratio of the <b>compression</b> and expansion <b>space</b> swept <b>volumes,</b> the ratio of total dead <b>volume</b> and expansion <b>space</b> swept <b>volume</b> and the phase angle between the volume variations of the expansion <b>space</b> and <b>compression</b> <b>space.</b> For optimizing the {{performance of}} a cryocooler, its cyclic analysis should be considered along with a loss analysis. The present paper attempts to find out the optimum combination of these design parameters for machines PLN- 106 and PLN- 108 s, for which design data are known. The objective functions of optimization can be based on COP maximization or any design constraints such as the total <b>volume</b> or <b>space</b> taken up by the machine, maximum pressure generation, etc. This paper first applies the optimization routine to the Philips machine and identifies the optimization function for which the machines are designed. The routine is then further extended to develop a generalized procedure for designing a cryocooler of any capacity. The procedure is applied to determine the different dimensions of machines with a liquid nitrogen producing capacity of 8 dm 3 h- 1. The design developed using this procedure is then compared with the actual existing design...|$|R

40|$|A double-acting, {{rotating}} piston reciprocating in {{a cylinder}} with {{the motion of}} the piston providing the valving action of the Sibling Cycle through the medium of passages between the piston and cylinder wall. The rotating piston contains regenerators ported to the walls of the piston. The piston fits closely in the cylinder {{at each end of the}} cylinder except in areas where the wall of the cylinder is relieved to provide passages between the cylinder wall and the piston leading to the expansion and <b>compression</b> <b>spaces,</b> respectively. The piston reciprocates as it rotates. The cylinder and piston together comprise an integral valve that seqentially opens and closes the ports at the ends of the regenerators alternately allowing them to communicate with the expansion <b>space</b> and <b>compression</b> <b>space</b> and blocking that communication. The relieved passages in the cylinder and the ports in the piston are so arranged that each regenerator is sequentially (1) charged with compressed working gas from the compression space; (2) isolated from both expansion and compression spaces; (3) discharged of working gas into the expansion space; and (4) simultaneously charged with working gas from the expansion space while being discharged of working gas into the <b>compression</b> <b>space,</b> in the manner of the Sibling Cycle.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. In this paper, an experiment is reported that was devised to measure the thermodynamic loss associated with the unsteady heat transfer {{that takes place in}} the <b>compression</b> <b>space</b> of a gas spring and to differentiate the loss from any mass leakage or viscous or dissipation frictional effects. As the total mass in the system is unknown, due to leakage between the cylinder and the piston, it is necessary to measure three thermo-dynamic bulk parameters in order to completely determine the system state. Pressure, temperature and volume are convenient choices. However there is a challenge in measuring the gas temperature in the <b>compression</b> <b>space</b> using traditional physically invasive methods, such as thermocouples. These methods generally have a number of undesirable side effects; for example their poor response times due to the added thermal mass, their sensitivity to the varying heat transfer in the cylinder, the disruption of the gas flow and gas temperature, {{and the fact that they}} only provide a point measurement within the flow. Instead, a novel technique is presented for the estimation of the bulk temperature of the gas by measuring the time of flight of an ultrasonic pulse across the <b>compression</b> <b>space.</b> The technique is based on the principle that the speed of sound in an ideal gas is dependent on the square root of the absolute temperature, based on which the temperature of the gas along the ultrasonic path can be found. The ultrasonic pulse is transmitted and received at 400 kHz using piezo ceramic transducers with a repetition rate of 1 kHz. This instantaneously resolved temperature information, along with the pressure and <b>volume</b> of the <b>compression</b> <b>space,</b> was used to calculate the work and heat flows into the <b>compression</b> <b>space.</b> It was therefore possible to measure the instantaneous rate of heat transfer throughout the compression expansion cycle of the gas spring. The heat transfer rate was seen to be linear for most of the cycle, with the heat flux proportional to the gas–wall temperature difference. There was however a deviation from this during expansion. The thermodynamic loss around the cycle of the gas spring was also measured and reported at different rotational speed. The loss was observed to increase with increasing P´eclet number which was in agreement with the theoretical models of a gas springdc 201...|$|R

40|$|Background: Loss {{of hearing}} is a {{national}} health problem with significant social and psychosocial implications. Worldwide there are about 65 - 330 million people affected with hearing impairment, of which 60 % suffers from significant hearing loss. Role of tympanic membrane and ossicular chain in the physiology of hearing is well documented. The emergence of {{the role played by}} mastoid air <b>space</b> <b>volume</b> in sound transmission is being critically evaluated these days. The present study is designed to analyze the effect of mastoid air <b>space</b> <b>volume</b> in tympanic membrane perforation with conductive hearing loss. Methods: 32 subjects both male and female with medium sized tympanic membrane perforation were included in the study. They were grouped into two (those with sclerotic and cellular mastoid). Hearing threshold assessed using pure tone audiometer. Mastoid air <b>space</b> <b>volume</b> evaluated using digital X-ray mastoid schuller's view. Tympanic membrane perforation size assessed using otoscope. Results: The hearing loss in first group having cellular mastoid and second group with sclerotic mastoid were 22. 82 +/- 6. 28 and 27. 82 +/- 5. 66 respectively. Their p value was 0. 026 which was statistically significant. Conclusions: Mastoid air <b>space</b> <b>volume</b> is inversely proportional to conductive hearing loss. Therefore mastoid air <b>space</b> <b>volume</b> also {{plays a key role in}} the sound transmission.
