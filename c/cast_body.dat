50|$|An {{orthopedic}} <b>cast,</b> <b>body</b> cast, plaster cast, or surgical cast, is a shell, frequently {{made from}} plaster or fiberglass, encasing a limb (or, in some cases, {{large portions of}} the body) to stabilize and hold anatomical structures, most often a broken bone (or bones), in place until healing is confirmed. It is similar in function to a splint.|$|E

Some used a pair of pistons for bump and rebound, others used a single double-acting piston. Flow of hydraulic oil around the piston took place through valves mounted in the body. Separate valves were provided for each direction, giving the useful feature of a different resistance to bump and rebound. These valves were sometimes easily adjustable from outside the damper body.|$|E

50|$|The F1 grenade {{replaced}} the M26 grenade in Australian {{service in the}} late 1990s. It is a high explosive, anti-personnel grenade with a lethal radius of 6 m, casualty radius of 15 m and a safety radius of 30 m. The grenade weighs 375g and contains over 4000 2.4 mm steel ball fragments arranged to achieve uniform distribution of lethal fragments through 360° upon functioning. It has a fuse time of 4.5 to 5.5 seconds. Thales Australia also manufactures an F3 practice grenade, being a non-fragmentation replica of the F1 used for training, incorporates a high impact aluminium die <b>cast</b> <b>body</b> and hazard band with a distinctive appearance. The F3 practice hand grenade has a replaceable pyrotechnic fuze that displays an audible output and a distinct cloud of white smoke visible to 200 m to indicate functioning.|$|E
5000|$|Die-casting {{became popular}} in the early 1930s among lock makers. Not only was it a very {{inexpensive}} way to make padlocks, but it allowed designers to design padlocks with {{a broad range of}} geometrical features and ornate designs that sand casting and machining wouldn't allow. Some lock makers, like Junkunc Brothers, augmented their machined solid body padlock products with the less expensive and more attractive die-cast bodied padlocks. The Wise Lock Company embraced this new medium in making a novel padlock that, with the key inserted, would split lengthwise along the body in order to create an opening in the shackle. Chicago Lock pioneered their new [...] "double bitted wafer" [...] and [...] "ACE" [...] products by installing them into a die <b>cast</b> <b>body.</b> With the advent of inexpensive machining done overseas and the overall poor perception of the security of die cast locks, they no longer dominate today's padlock market.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the large}} size and extreme {{immobilization}} some casts, particularly {{those used in}} or before the 1970s, the popular term full <b>body</b> <b>cast</b> {{is something of a}} misnomer. The popular and media-driven conception of a massive cast encasing all four limbs, the trunk, and the head – sometimes leaving only small slits for the eyes, nose, and mouth – is a true rarity in recorded medical history, and this type of large scale cast appears more commonly in various Hollywood movies and on television shows.

40|$|Effect of suction {{pressure}} p_ and permeability K_m of plaster mold on the slip casting {{of a high}} concentrated alumina slurry of 58. 8 vol% was investigated. Three cylindrical plaster molds were fabricated from the slurries having water-to-plaster mass ratios of 0. 55, 0. 63 and 1, and designated as the 55 % -mold, 63 % -mold and 100 % -mold. The 55 %, 63 % and 100 % -molds were characterized by low p_ and low K_m, high p_ and low K_m, and lowp_ and high K_m, respectively. Casting rate {{at an early stage}} increased with increasing p_ x K_m or K_m, and average bulk density of <b>cast</b> <b>body</b> increased with increasing p_. Local green density increased from the center toward the wall of mold because of consolidation of the compressible cake. High p_ x K_m and low p_ enhanced percolation effect, and resulted in remarkable segregation of fine particles near the mold wall.

40|$|Purpose: In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} finite element mesh {{management}} technique applied to analyze thermal stressdistribution of mushy region including molten materials and solidifying shell. Design/methodology/approach: In this study we terminated and eliminated the finite elements representingmolten materials on the element list. When they became cooler than the liquidus temperature, the deletedelements were recreated. Findings: We considered temperature-dependent material properties during simulation and adopted hybridFDM/FEM method for enhancing accuracy: We validated the proposed technique by comparing with othermethods. As results, the proposed method is found to effectively simulate real-time casting process. Research limitations/implications: The resulting simulation of conventional methods should induce errors onestimating residual stress of the cast subjected to non-uniform cooling. For the stress analysis study of castingprocess before complete solidification, we introduce a special technique to treat molten parts in the numericalprocedure. This study proposes a method reducing by several orders the elastic modulus of molten materialthrough employing a reduction factor. Practical implications: Conventional casting process simulations don’t consider stress due to complexrheological behavior of molten metals until the cast completely solidifies. Achieving uniform cooling rate ina whole <b>cast</b> <b>body</b> while solidifying must be an ideal casting process to avoid undesirable thermal distortionand stress in product which may induce hot tear and crack. Conventionally many prototyping tests should beconducted to this end and necessitate expensive costs. Originality/value: In this study we propose a new technique of “Element Creation and Termination” whichterminates (or removes) molten elements and creates them just after they cool down to lower than liquidustemperature. Notice that the previous methods do not remove but deactivate molten elements...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} critical {{reading of the}} early work of the American artist, Bruce Nauman, who, in the mid-sixties, began creating a highly diverse and eclectic oeuvre [...] including discrete sculpture, photographic and text pieces, video and audio installations, neon signs, and <b>cast</b> <b>body</b> parts. While most studies focus on either one medium, theme, or body of work for review, I take a synthetic approach, arguing that the failure to locate the coherence of Nauman's art {{is due to the}} challenges it proposes theoretically and art historically. In the literature, the art of the late sixties is frequently divided into two strains of practice, which are seen as mutually exclusive [...] one defined through models of language, the other through the body and performance. Nauman's art, however, undermines the legitimacy of these divisions. As such, I propose that it raises philosophical and theoretical questions regarding the meanings of language, action, the body, experience, and subjectivity, resulting in the necessity for an art historical re-evaluation of their significance. The point of departure for my investigation is Nauman's reception of Minimalist sculpture, which challenged the traditional idea of medium and interrogated the perceptual conditions of the art object. I propose that Nauman' art, however, lends historical and social specificity to this project, responding to the extraordinary growth of technology and expansions of media in the sixties, which were, paradoxically, accompanied by a philosophical critique of the subject. (cont.) As a result, I suggest that Nauman's practice overcomes the abstract notions of experience and limited definition of subjectivity Minimalism proposes. By examining the multiple material forms his investigation takes, I conclude that the very opacity of Nauman's art emerge as an embodiment [...] or an enactment [...] of its meanings. From enigmatic body sculptures, which are frequently mistitled, to proposals for impossible performances, to the use of confining architectural spaces mediated by sound, light, and video recordings, the potentiality for communication (linguistic, perceptual) to fail or manipulate can be recognized as a central theme of Nauman's technically and stylistically diverse, but conceptually consistent, work. by Janet L.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} the study was the {{clinical}} implementation of a kV cone beam CT (CBCT) for setup correction in radiotherapy. Patients and methods For evaluation of the setup correction workflow, six tumor patients (lung cancer, sacral chordoma, head-and-neck and paraspinal tumor, and two prostate cancer patients) were selected. All patients were treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, five of them with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). For patient fixation, a scotch <b>cast</b> <b>body</b> frame or a vacuum pillow, each in combination with a scotch cast head mask, were used. The imaging equipment, consisting of an x-ray tube and a flat panel imager (FPI), was attached to a Siemens linear accelerator according to the in-line approach, i. e. with the imaging beam mounted opposite to the treatment beam sharing the same isocenter. For dose delivery, the treatment beam has to traverse the FPI which is mounted in the accessory tray below the multi-leaf collimator. For each patient, a predefined number of imaging projections over a range of at least 200 degrees were acquired. The fast reconstruction of the 3 D-CBCT dataset was done with an implementation of the Feldkamp-David-Kress (FDK) algorithm. For the registration of the treatment planning CT with the acquired CBCT, an automatic mutual information matcher and manual matching was used. Results and discussion Bony landmarks were easily detected and the table shifts for correction of setup deviations could be automatically calculated in all cases. The image quality was sufficient for a visual comparison of the desired target point with the isocenter visible on the CBCT. Soft tissue contrast was problematic for the prostate of an obese patient, but good in the lung tumor case. The detected maximum setup deviation was 3 mm for patients fixated with the body frame, and 6 mm for patients positioned in the vacuum pillow. Using an action level of 2 mm translational error, a target point correction was carried out in 4 cases. The additional workload of the described workflow compared to a normal treatment fraction led to an extra time of about 10 – 12 minutes, which can be further reduced by streamlining the different steps. Conclusion The cone beam CT attached to a LINAC allows the acquisition of a CT scan of the patient in treatment position directly before treatment. Its image quality is sufficient for determining target point correction vectors. With the presented workflow, a target point correction within a clinically reasonable time frame is possible. This increases the treatment precision, and potentially the complex patient fixation techniques will become dispensable. </p...|$|E
