5|$|Frederick Benjamin <b>Carlin</b> {{was born}} on 27 July 1912 in Northam, Western Australia, {{a small town in}} the state's Wheatbelt. His mother, the former Charlotte Amelia Bramwell, died when he was four, and he was raised by his father, Frederick Cecil <b>Carlin,</b> who was an {{electrical}} engineer employed with the Western Australian Government Railways. At the age of ten, <b>Carlin</b> was sent to board at Guildford Grammar School in Perth. Leaving school in 1929, he enrolled at the School of Mines in Kalgoorlie, where he studied mining engineering. Once he had qualified as an engineer, he worked {{for a period of time}} in the surrounding Goldfields region. However, in 1939, he moved to Peking, China, to work for a British coal mining company.|$|E

5|$|As the 1880s progressed, Cope's and Marsh's men faced stiff {{competition}} {{from each other}} and from third parties interested in bones. Professor Alexander Emanuel Agassiz of Harvard sent his own representatives west, while <b>Carlin</b> and Frank Williston formed a bone company to sell fossils to the highest bidder. Reed left and became a sheep herder in 1884, and Marsh's Como quarries yielded little after his departure. Despite these setbacks, Marsh had more operational quarries than Cope at this point of time; Cope, who at the early 1880s had more bones than he could fit in a single house, had fallen behind in the race for dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Bird's feature race {{victory was}} his—and Russian Time's—second {{of the season}} and Coletti's sprint race win meant he became the first Monegasque driver to win on the streets of Monaco since Louis Chiron in 1931. The race results {{resulted}} in Coletti increasing his lead {{at the top of the}} Drivers' Championship to 24 points ahead of Felipe Nasr. Bird's feature race win meant he gained two positions to move into third while Leimer dropped to fourth. Rapax took over the lead of the Teams' Championship from <b>Carlin</b> and Russian Time's strong results enabled the company to take over third place. Racing Engineering rounded out the top four with seven rounds left in the season.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh {{used their}} {{personal}} wealth to fund expeditions each summer, then spent the winter publishing their discoveries. Small armies of fossil hunters in mule-drawn wagons or on trains were soon sending literally tons of fossils back east. The paleontological digs lasted fifteen years, from 1877 to 1892. The workers for both Cope and Marsh suffered hardships {{related to the}} weather, as well as sabotage and obstruction by the other scientist's workers. Reed was locked out of the Como train station by <b>Carlin,</b> {{and was forced to}} haul the bones down the bluff and crate the specimens on the train platform in the bitter cold. Cope directed <b>Carlin</b> to set up his own quarry in Como Bluff, while Marsh sent Reed to spy on his former friend. As Reed's Quarry #4 dried up, Marsh ordered Reed to clear out the bone fragments from the other quarries. Reed reported he had destroyed all the remaining bones to keep them away from Cope. Concerned that strangers were encroaching on Reed's quarries, Marsh sent Lakes to Como to assist in excavations, and in June 1879 visited Como himself. Cope likewise toured his own quarries in August. Although Marsh's men continued to open new quarries and discover more fossils, relations between Lakes and Reed soured, with each offering his resignation in August. Marsh attempted to placate the two by sending each to opposite ends of the quarries, but after being forced to abandon one bone quarry in a freezing blizzard, Lakes submitted his resignation and returned to teaching in 1880. The departure of Lakes did not ease tensions among Marsh's men; Lake's replacement, a railroad man named Kennedy, felt {{he did not have to}} report to Reed, and the fighting between the two caused Marsh's other workers to quit. Marsh tried separating Kennedy and Reed, and sent Williston's brother Frank to Como in an effort to keep the peace. Frank Williston ended up leaving Marsh's employ and taking up residence with <b>Carlin.</b> Cope's own digging in Como began faltering, and Carlin's replacements soon quit work altogether.|$|E

5|$|On Mardi Gras in New Orleans, {{the ferry}} Sen. Alvin T. Stumpf is {{carrying}} hundreds of U.S. Navy sailors {{and their families}} across the Mississippi River from their base to the city. Suddenly, the ferry explodes and sinks, killing 543 passengers and crew members. Special Agent Douglas <b>Carlin</b> (Denzel Washington) from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is sent to investigate and discovers evidence of a bomb planted by a domestic terrorist. Arriving at the scene he meets with local investigators and FBI Special Agent Paul Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), and informs them of his findings. He learns about and is invited to examine a partially burned body pulled from the river, identified as Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), which was reported to the authorities minutes before the explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the round meant Coletti {{increased}} his advantage at {{the lead of the}} Drivers' Championship on 120 points. Nasr remained in second place, 24 points behind Coletti, while Bird's feature race victory enabled him to move into third position. Because he did not score any points in the two races, Leimer fell to fourth and Calado gained three positions to rounded out the top five. Rapax took over the lead of the Teams' Championship and were a solitary point ahead of previous leaders <b>Carlin.</b> Russian Time's form enabled the company to move into third place on 80 points and were a further sixteen in front of fourth-placed Racing Engineering. Arden took over fifth place with seven rounds left in the season.|$|E
5|$|Argentine Sergio Rinland {{designed}} the team's final cars around Judd engines, except for 1991 when Yamaha powered the cars. In the 1992 season the cars (which were updated {{versions of the}} 1991 car) rarely qualified for races. Hill gave the team its final finish, at the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he crossed the finish line 11th and last, four laps behind the winner, Ayrton Senna. After {{the end of that}} race the team ran out of funds and collapsed. Middlebridge Group Limited had been unable to continue making repayments against the £6million ultimately provided by Landhurst Leasing, which went into administration. The Serious Fraud Office investigated the case. Landhurst's managing directors were found guilty of corruption and imprisoned, having accepted bribes for further loans to Middlebridge. It was one of four teams to leave Formula One that year. (cf March Engineering, Fondmetal and Andrea Moda Formula). Although there was talk of reviving the team for the following year, its assets passed to Landhurst Leasing and were auctioned by the company's receivers in 1993. Among these was the team's old factory in Chessington, which was acquired by Yamaha Motor Sports and used to house Activa Technology Limited, a company manufacturing composite components for race and road cars run by Herbie Blash. The factory was bought by the <b>Carlin</b> DPR GP2 motor racing team in 2006.|$|E

500|$|The couple began testing {{their craft}} in 1947, and {{experienced}} problems with carbon monoxide removal, with the vessel's enclosed structure potentially increasing {{the risks of}} carbon monoxide poisoning. The <b>Carlins</b> chose Montreal, Quebec, Canada, as the official starting point of their circumnavigation attempt. They set out from the city in late 1947 for New York City, where they were to launch Half-Safe for the first time, {{with the intention of}} crossing the Atlantic via the Azores. A trial run was made in early January 1948, watched by [...] "crowds of sceptical waterside workers". The couple's first attempt to complete the transatlantic crossing occurred on 16 June 1948, launching from New York Harbor. Cheered on by [...] "100 amazed wharf labourers", they were first washed up-river by a strong tide, but then made their way out into the Atlantic at a speed of five knots. The <b>Carlins</b> failed to maintain radio contact, prompting a search by the United States Coast Guard. The craft was eventually landed five days after its departure, [...] south of New York City near the Shark River inlet in New Jersey. The couple had experienced problems with the steering gear and rudder, which made the vessel unable to steer at sea unless the wheel was constantly manned. With Half-Safe sailed back to New York, the <b>Carlins</b> commenced their journey for a second time on 3 July, but were once again forced back to shore a few days later, this time after nearly being asphyxiated due to a cracked exhaust pipe.|$|R

The documentary was first shown at the AFI Film Festival on November 7, 2005, at ArcLight Hollywood in Hollywood.|$|R
5|$|Friday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session ran for 30-minutes. The drivers' fastest lap times {{determined the}} starting {{order for the}} first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. The session was held in cooler night-time weather conditions. Drivers used soft-compound tyres for their first timed laps before entering the pit lane for new tyres {{for the remainder of}} the session. Vandoorne set the pace in the early part of the session and improved to clinch his first pole position of the season, and his fifth consecutive in the series, with a time of 1:39.237. He was joined on the grid's front row by his teammate Matsushita who was three-tenths of a second slower than Vandoorne. Lynn was ninth after his first timed lap but recovered to qualify in third place. Pic, who was Vandoorne's closest contender in the session's opening segment, took fourth, ahead of Marciello who was stuck in second gear until his team corrected the issue. King was relegated to sixth by Marciello's fastest lap. Norman Nato and Rossi were seventh and eighth. Gasly made a mistake late in the session which restricted him to ninth and Sirotkin rounded out the top ten. Artem Markelov was the fastest driver to not qualify in the top-ten starting positions; his best lap time was seven-tenths of a second slower than Vandoorne. Haryanto ran strongly in the session's early period but took 12th after he was unable to improve on his second set of soft-compound tyres. He was ahead of Evans, Robert Visoiu, and Richie Stanaway. The two <b>Carlin</b> drivers qualified in 16th and 18th (with Julián Leal ahead of Marco Sørensen). They were separated by Sergio Canamasas in the faster of the two MP Motorsport cars. André Negrão, Daniël de Jong, Nathanaël Berthon, René Binder, Marlon Stöckinger, and Zoël Amberg were the last of the qualifiers.|$|E

Those on the lower border appear to be in raised cast brass lettering, those on the order borders appear to have been cut into the frame's timber.|$|R
50|$|A {{traditional}} wood deck would {{consist of}} planks laid fore and aft over beams and along <b>carlins,</b> the seams of which are caulked and paid with tar. A yacht or other fancy boat might then have the deck canvased, with the fabric laid down in {{a thick layer of}} paint or sealant, and additional coats painted over. The wash or apron boards form the joint between the deck planking and that of the topsides, and are caulked similarly.|$|R
50|$|Knee - A short L shaped {{piece of}} wood that joins or {{strengthens}} boat parts that meet at about 60 to 120 degrees. It may be a natural crook (e.g. apple, oak, pohutukawa) or sawn from a larger length of timber or laminated in a wooden vessel. Commonly seen on thwarts to join topsides or keelsons to join transoms. A hanging knee fits upside down e.g. underneath a thwart rather than on top. Hanging knees often support <b>carlins</b> where a full frame would be inconvenient.|$|R
