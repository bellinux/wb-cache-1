Some results are found in this research: (1) During 2005 – 2011, the energy consumption kept increasing, while the total CO 2 emissions fluctuated obviously in 2008 and 2011. The energy structure and the industrial structure have been optimized to a certain extent. (2) If the policies are completely implemented, the POL scenario is projected to save 21. 36 and 35. 37 % of the total energy consumption and CO 2 emissions than the BAU scenario during 2012 and 2030. (3) The POL scenario presents a more optimized energy structure compared with the BAU scenario, with the decrease of coal consumption and the increase of natural gas consumption. (4) The commerce and service sector and the energy <b>conversion</b> <b>sector</b> will become the largest contributor to energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, respectively. The transport sector and the industrial sector are the two most potential sectors in energy savings and carbon reduction.

40|$|As a {{physical}} {{assessment of the}} sustainability of the China society, {{presented in this paper}} is an exergy-based systems account for resources use and environmental emissions of the China society in 2006 as the most recent year with statistics availability. Exergy analysis is applied to elucidate the resources flows from the natural environment into the society, between other countries or regions and the society, between the sectors of the society, and the emissions outflows into the natural environment from different sectors. For the China society broken down into seven sectors (i. e., extraction, conversion, agriculture, industry, transportation, tertiary and households) {{as one of the most}} complicated cases, systems account of environmental emissions as greenhouse gases and "three wastes" is carried out for the first time, combined with an updated resources account. The total societal exergy consumption amounts to 101. 1 Â EJ, of which 93. 6 % is due to resources use accounted as 94. 6 Â EJ, of which 23. 2 % is by the industry sector, 22. 8 % by conversion, 20. 4 % by households, 12. 3 % by agriculture, 9. 0 % by tertiary, 6. 9 % by extraction and 5. 4 % by transport, and 6. 4 % due to environmental emissions accounted as 6481. 6 Â PJ, including greenhouse gas emissions of 5706. 1 Â PJ, with the highly remarkable fraction of 49. 05 % from CH 4 of the same importance as 50. 91 % from CO 2 and only 0. 04 % from N 2 O, and "three wastes" emissions of only 775. 5 Â PJ. The extraction sector is shown as the leading emitter with 32. 6 % of the total emissions, followed by the industry with 20. 0 %, agriculture with 17. 3 %, and <b>conversion</b> <b>sector</b> with 16. 8 %. To characterize the network performance in context of environmental resources from a systems ecological perspective, exergy-based ecological efficiency and resources conversion coefficient are found as 88. 8 % and 91. 3 % for the extraction sector, 29. 0 % and 30. 0 % for the <b>conversion</b> <b>sector,</b> 31. 5 % and 33. 5 % for the agriculture sector, 34. 8 % and 36. 1 % for the industry sector, 16. 3 % and 17. 3 % for the transportation sector, 38. 4 % and 38. 5 % for the tertiary sector, and only 1. 3 % and 1. 3 % for the households sector, respectively.

The methodologies employed in this second part include Exergy Analysis (EA) and Extended Exergy Analysis (EEA). Exergy inputs and outputs amounted to 17423. 9 and 11888. 7 Â PJ, respectively, with energy carries, mainly fossil fuels, being both the predominant inputs (15597. 1 Â PJ) and outputs (5147. 1 Â PJ). Exergy consumption and efficiency for various economic sectors and subsectors have been calculated with the residential and service sector showing the lowest exergy conversion efficiencies (11. 2 % and 12. 3 %, respectively) while certain industrial subsectors, such as the aluminium and iron/steel industries showed the highest exergy conversion factors (67. 0 and 62. 1 %).

40|$|Summary. This paper {{challenges}} the widespread view {{that there was}} a rental housing supply crisis in the late 1980 s in Ontario and shows that the increase in rental during that period was far greater than the number of new purpose-built rental units. Conversions and investor-owned condominiums made a major contribution. Contrary to conventional wisdom, conversions came from the relatively new stock and tenure switches unassociated with structural change were important. The importance of the conversion phenomenon is underlined by evidence that the <b>conversion</b> <b>sector</b> of the rental market was far looser in 1989 than in 1971. This suggests that the official rental vacancy rate, for large buildings, is misleading as an indicator of overall availability. The paper argues that the rise in the relative importance of conversions and investor-owned condominiums is no fluke, but rather is the consequence of the interaction of the income tax system and the high rates of inflation and capital gains of the 1970 s and 1980 s, as well as certain details of Ontario rent regulation. It argues that these forces have encouraged conversions of units from ownership to rental, additions of rental units in small buildings rather than in large, and non-corporate ownerships...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring the {{progress}} of the European Union and its Member States towards the EU’s energy efficiency target is a crucial part of the mandatory process as defined in the Energy Efficiency Directive 2012 / 27 /EU. In this paper, we conduct index decomposition analyses to show the effects of both policies and autonomous developments driving the changes of primary energy consumption for the European Union (EU 28) and its Member States for the time period of 2000 to 2014, with a comparative analysis of Germany and Poland. These analyses are based on the logarithmic mean Divisia index methodology and primarily on data compiled by Eurostat. They are carried out on two levels, i. e. on the level of total primary energy consumption {{as well as on the}} level of primary energy consumption related to electricity generation. The first level examines the influences of changes in final energy consumption and changes within the energy <b>conversion</b> <b>sector</b> on primary energy consumption. With the second level, we provide insights into the effects of changes in electricity consumption and production. According to our first-level analysis, the consumption of primary energy in the EU 28 is primarily influenced by an increased share of electrical energy and the counteracting effect of rising efficiency in electricity generation, induced by an increasing share of renewable energies. Furthermore, the reduction of final energy consumption had a significant decreasing influence on primary energy consumption in the European Union. The second level of our analysis regarding electricity generation shows that the increasing effect on primary energy consumption due to the rising consumption of electricity was mainly compensated by substituting nuclear and thermal power plants by renewable energy technologies...|$|E
40|$|Granular mixing has a {{significant}} influence on the resulting products {{in a variety of}} industries, such as pharmaceutical production, food processing, and energy generation. Most commonly, granular mixing processes seek a high degree of homogeneity, and in some particular instances, the purpose is to influence simultaneous processing, such as chemical reactions and heat and/or mass transfer rates. Granular mixing is a complex process because it exhibits multiple rheological differences, many times simultaneously within the same granular bed. A fundamental problem commonly encountered during the mixing of granular materials is the tendency for mixtures to segregate due to differences in particle size, shape, and/or density. While significant effort has been made to improve the granular mixing process, the vast majority of granular mixing research efforts have focused on relatively simple mixer geometries and idealized granular materials compared to what is actually used in industrial practice. For example, the renewable energy industry, or more specifically the biomass thermochemical <b>conversion</b> <b>sector,</b> relies on double screw pyrolyzers to convert cellulosic biomass into bio-oil. Currently, there is a large amount of research that relates the feedstocks being used to the bio-oil yields; however, minimal research efforts have been directed toward studying the granular mixing dynamics inside the double screw pyrolyzer due to the opaque nature of the reactor and the granular flow itself. The overall goal of this project is to thoroughly understand, characterize, and optimize the granular mixing of low density red oak chips and high density glass beads within a double screw mixer, which geometrically replicates screw pyrolyzers, under various operating conditions. Moreover, it aims to provide an improved understanding of the biomass and heat carrier media granular mixing dynamics inside the screw pyrolyzer. The increased mixing effectiveness and insight gained through this project will lead to increased heat transfer rates and could enhance product yield and/or quality; thereby improving the economic viability of a screw pyrolyzer. Throughout this project, a number of different visualization and quantification techniques have been developed and used to evaluate the mixing effectiveness of red oak chips and glass beads inside a screw mixer that was designed and constructed specifically for granular mixing studies. Four parameters were initially investigated: (i) screw rotation speed, (ii) dimensionless screw pitch, (iii) screw rotation orientation, and (iv) material injection configuration. After identifying the influence that these parameters had on the mixing effectiveness, the effect of the dimensionless mixing length was also investigated. Advanced optical visualization methods were first developed by capturing, and then spatially aligning and temporally syncing four independent projections of the screw mixer. Next, an improved granular sampling procedure which satisfies the two 2 ̆ 2 golden rules of sampling 2 ̆ 2 was developed. Composition analysis of the samples was then coupled to analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical methods to qualitatively assess the spatial heterogeneity of the granular mixing process. Together, the qualitative optical visualization and quantitative composition and statistical analysis lead to the optimization of the screw mixer 2 ̆ 7 s operating conditions. For the range of parameters that were studied, these conditions were determined to be a screw rotation speed of ω = 60 rpm, a dimensionless screw pitch of p/D = 1. 75, a counter-rotating down-pumping screw rotation orientation (CtrR DP), and a material injection configuration with the red oak chips and glass beads injected into port one and two (RO 1, GB 2), respectively. Studies which investigated the mixing effectiveness of the screw mixer {{as a function of the}} dimensionless mixing length also indicated that this operating condition lead to the most homogeneous mixture at each of the tested dimensionless mixing lengths. An improved cone-beam compensated back-projection algorithm enabling X-ray particle tracking velocimetry (XPTV) of the screw mixer was then developed to visualize and quantify the 3 D granular flow structures inside the screw mixer under various operating condition using 2 ̆ 2 modified 2 ̆ 2 red oak chip tracer particles. It was shown that these improved XPTV methods provided {{a significant}} reduction in error associated with the tracer particle 2 ̆ 7 s position. The influence of the aforementioned four factors on the granular flow structures inside the screw mixer were investigated using XPTV, and similar results in terms of the desired operating conditions to those from the previous studies were noted. Moreover, the counter-rotating down-pumping screw rotation orientation, which was found to be the most influential factor using the composition and statistical analysis methods, was also shown to increase the material residence time, resulting in a longer mixing time. A number of different methods were developed and used to characterize the granular mixing process inside the screw mixer. While each of the methods provided a different view on mixing behavior, the studies converged on a single double screw mixer operating condition, leading to a conclusive mixing effectiveness optimization...|$|E

40|$|In the “Policy Scenarios for Climate Protection VI” {{project the}} {{greenhouse}} gas emissions for Germany are assessed based on model analyses for detailed specific energy and climate policy instruments. In the Current Policy Scenario (CPS) all measures which have been implemented by 8 July 2011 (and those which entered into force {{for the first time}} or were changed after 1. 1. 2005) are taken into consideration. Compared to the reference year of 1990, a 34 % reduction of the emissions of greenhouse gases falling under the Kyoto Protocol 4 is achieved by 2020. By 2030 the emissions are reduced by 44 %. Over half f of the emission reductions originate from policies that target the energy <b>conversion</b> <b>sectors,</b> most notably from electricity production. In terms of the instrument-specific effects, the largest share of the reduction in {{greenhouse gas emissions}} stems from instruments geared to saving electricity (e. g. the emission trading scheme (ETS)) 5, building rehabilitation programs, the promotion of renewable energies in electricity and heat production, (European) efficiency standards for passenger cars and the use of bio fuels. Primary energy consumption in Germany decreases by 9 % by 2020 and by 19 % by 2030 compared to 20086. The contribution made by renewable energies to the primary energy supply approximately doubles by 2020; by 2030 the contribution increases by approx. a factor of 2. 5. Overall the share of renewable energies in the primary energy supply increases from approx. 9 % in 2008 to 19. 5 % in 2020 and to more than 27 % in 2030. Alongside the energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, substantial emission reductions in the Current Policy Scenario are achieved by measures and developments in industrial processes and waste management. In the Energy Transformation Scenario (ETS) additional measures which go beyond the ones described above are taken into account. These additional measures bring about an emission reduction of approx. 42 % by 2020 and of more than 58 % by 2030 (compared to 1990). More than half of the emission reductions achieved stem from the energy <b>conversion</b> <b>sectors</b> and, above all, electricity production. The largest emission reduction effects of the policy instruments analysed in this report arise from the more robust implementation of energy rehabilitation standards in the buildings sector, the measures geared to more efficient use of electricity in the tertiary and households sectors, including the effect of higher electricity prices {{as a consequence of the}} EU Emissions Trading Scheme, more ambitious efficiency standards for passenger cars and the increased use of renewable energies in the heat, transport and electricity production sectors. Primary energy consumption in Germany decreases in this scenario by approx. 16 % by 2020 and by approx. 32 % by 2030 compared to 2008. The share of renewable energies increases by a factor of 2. 2 by 2020 and by a factor of 2. 8 by 2030 compared to 2008; overall the share of renewable energies in the primary energy supply increases to approx. 23 % by 2020 and to approx. 36 % by 2030...|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of Shinkansen in 1964, a unique inter-city {{transport}} network in which high-speed railway and air transport developed simultaneously, emerged in Japan, and modal choice between them based on price and speed has been manifested. Looking ahead, the next generation high-speed transport, the Maglev, is on the horizon. In order to capture the full impacts of the Maglev technology, simulation analysis with a dynamic spatial nested logit model was conducted. From this, we identified a significant opportunity for the Maglev Super-express between Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka, but with net benefitsexceeding net costs only with an annual economic growth of approximately 2 % - 3 % achieved in the next 65 years in Japan. If such economic condition were realized, the total air transport market would also continue to grow despite strong competition from the Shinkansen/Maglev system. Another point of interest is Maglev’s impact on reducing global warming. CO 2 emission from Maglev is one-third of air transport. Introduction of Maglev Super-express in inter-city transport, however, also attracts passengers from Shinkansen that has five times lower CO 2 emission intensity. Indeed, our simulation analysis shows that total CO 2 emissions from high-speed inter-city transport increases when Maglev Super-express is introduced. Increase in total CO 2 emission from electricity users including Maglev Super-express could be mitigated by energy <b>conversion</b> <b>sector’s</b> effort to reduce CO 2 content of electric power supply, for instance, by increasing utilization of nuclear energy.

40|$|A nation-wide climate policy {{targeting}} the power sector {{might lead to}} dramatic changes to Indiana 2 ̆ 7 s electricity generation system. This is because Indiana relies heavily on coal as its primary source for electricity generation and coal is much more carbon-intensive than other fossil fuels. In the possible event that Indiana {{will have to take}} action on carbon mitigation, for example because of a national climate policy in the future, it is important for state policymakers to understand the costs and efficacy of alternative strategies. In addition, assessing the impacts of the policy alternatives on Indiana serves as guidance for the national policy design process regarding the subnational impacts. ^ A linear-programming optimization model was created based on the MARKAL energy system model framework to analyze the impact of a potential national climate policy on the state of Indiana. This model is named IN-MARKAL and is built based on comprehensive research into Indiana 2 ̆ 7 s energy-economic system, including primary resource supply, energy <b>conversion</b> <b>sectors</b> and end-use sectors. ^ Alternative scenarios explored in this study include a base case scenario and six renewable portfolio standard (RPS) scenarios, including two without trading in renewable energy credits (RECs) and four with REC trading at various costs. In addition, three carbon tax scenarios and two rate-based carbon cap scenarios are studied. The results of the model show that an RPS is a very cost effective option among the policy tools examined. An RPS can achieve substantial emissions reductions for the power sector of Indiana, but it may also lead to a less reliable generation mix. A carbon tax appears to be the least cost effective tool to reduce carbon emissions for Indiana based on the tax trajectories modeled. The emission cap is effective for realizing deep carbon reductions with moderate cost and leads to a diverse generation portfolio for Indiana, but the intermediate goal for Indiana specified in the current EPA proposal may not be achievable, resulting in a large increase in the marginal cost of electricity during the policy phase in, rather than the smooth electricity cost trajectory observed in some other scenarios. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} exergy and extended exergy analyses to large complex systems. The system to be analysed {{is assumed to be}} at steady state, and the input and output fluxes of matter and energy are expressed in units of exergy. Human societies of any reasonable extent are indeed Very Large Complex Systems and can be represented as interconnected networks of N elementary “components”, their Subsystems; the detail of the disaggregation depends on the type and quality of the available data. The structural connectivity of the “model” of the System must correctly describe the interactions of each mass or energy flow with each sector of the society: since it is seldom the case that all of these fluxes are available in detail, some preliminary mass- and energy balances must be completed and constitute in fact a part of the initial assumptions. Exergy accounting converts the total amount of resources inflow into their equivalent exergetic form {{with the help of a}} table of “raw exergy data” available in the literature. The quantification of each flow on a homogeneous exergetic basis paves the way to the evaluation of the efficiency of each energy and mass transfer between the N sectors and makes it possible to quantify the irreversible losses and identify their sources. The advantage of the EEA, compared to a classical exergy accounting, is the inclusion in the system balance of the exergetic equivalents of three additional “Production Factors”: human Labour, Capital and Environmental Remediation costs. EEA has an additional advantage: it allows for the calculation of the efficiency of the domestic sector (impossible to evaluate with any other energy- or exergy-based method) by considering the working hours as its product. As implied in the title, an application of the method was made to a model of the province of Siena (on a year 2000 database) : the results show that the sectors of this Province have values of efficiency close to the Italian average, with the exception of the commercial and energy <b>conversion</b> <b>sectors</b> that are more efficient, in agreement with the rather peculiar socio-economic situation of the Province. The largest inefficiency is found to be in the transportation sector, which has an efficiency lower then 30 % in EEA and lower than 10 % in classical exergy accounting...|$|R

A topology control algorithm K-DRNG based on multi-beam antenna in heterogeneous wireless Ad Hoc network is proposed. The algorithm is mainly composed of three phases. In the stage of information collection, each node collects information of neighborhood by adjusting the transmitting power and controlling <b>sector</b> <b>conversion.</b> In the stage of topology construction, each node constructs directed relative neighborhood graph according to link weighs. In the stage of topology optimization, each node constructs subgragh of initial topology and adds or deletes directional links with neighborhood to guarantee bi-directional connectivity of topology. The simulation results show the proposed algorithm can reduce the average energy consumption of nodes, increase the spatial reuse of radio resource, thus improve integral network performance...|$|R

In particular, the infrastructures to support the two most comparable modes of freight transportation - highway and intermodal rail - are examined as alternatives for public fund allocation. Indicators for public sector transportation infrastructure investment mix are established based on financial analysis of both private and social costs and benefits, {{as well as the}} propensity of freight shippers to utilize such infrastructures. The research results in recommendations for the aggregate allocation of public funds in the US based on these indicators. We find that approximately a quarter of truck freight could be handled at a 25 % lower cost if rail infrastructure to support it existed. Because an additional 80 % reduction in social costs could be achieved through this modal <b>conversion,</b> the public <b>sector</b> is a critical participant in creating a more efficient transportation infrastructure. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{important}} issue, {{for both}} central {{and local governments}} in the 2000 's is financial reconstruction and administrative reform. And, pursuing a policy of government decentralization has been regarded as an important issue in 1990 's, and since 1999 it has received much attention at the central government and local government levels. In 1999,the Government Decentralization Law was passed. As expected, {{that the relationship between}} the central and local government has changed drastically.

40|$|The doctorial {{thesis is}} focused on shadow pricing. The aim is to {{describe}} as complex and full description of the problem as possible. Briefly said, Shadow prices are prices of goods which would take {{a place on the}} efficient market, if such a market with the commodity existed. In the case of consumption benefits they in fact present monetary value of the utility increment resulted from additional consumption. They are basic information input into any socioeconomic evaluation. Research of shadow prices is underdeveloped in the Czech Republic. With respect to the fact the thesis contents description of basic theoretical concepts as well as list of attainable methods for shadow prices derivation. Main variables determining shadow prices (under condition of WTP, WTA and Social Opportunity Costs concepts) are the existed society welfare and social preferences. From this perspective if clear and evident that there would not be appropriate to use shadow prices conducted abroad for evaluation in the Czech economy. Each state has its own level of welfare as well as specific social and ethical values widespread among citizens and so specific shadow prices as well. Not just shadow prices them self are not simply applicable for evaluation in each country. Similar problem we have to face, if we try to use the same methods of deriving shadow prices in different areas. That is why the thesis also serves critical analysis of attainable methods and their assessment. Based on the assessment is stated, what methods are more or less appropriate and under which condition in the Czech area. In principal should shadow prices reflect Social Opportunity Costs of input usage for evaluated changes and Willingness to Pay of the society for the outputs of evaluated changes (or alternatively Willingness to Accept) with no respect to the fact if the good (or output or input) is market good or nonmarket good. Even though we differentiate in the methodological level between market and nonmarket good the theoretical and conceptual background is the same. The background is rooted in the neoclassical economics. For the practical reasons as a analyst time and budget constrain it is not too efficient in evaluation of marketed goods always perform deep empirical market analysis from primary data even though it would be theoretically ideal and correct. Fortunately we are usually not forced to do it. In majority of cases we can follow LMST methodology of shadow prices and derive so called Conversion Factors for transformation of market prices to shadow prices. The Conversion factors are usually derived for wider group of goods which is sold in the similar market. Such values we call <b>Sector</b> <b>Conversion</b> Factors. A Shadow price of an individual unique good we than receive by its market price multiplication by most appropriate <b>sector</b> <b>conversion</b> factor. With respect to current Czech evaluation practice situation, when <b>sector</b> <b>conversion</b> factor are very often used but their estimates are more less based on very poor quality of underlying theory and very often without sufficient data background, the quantification of SCF in the theses could be viewed as quite significant contribution. With respect to their specific characteristics nonmarket good as safety (VSL), time, noise, etc. should be valued separately. And the thesis is offering at least methodological contributive guidelines regarding theoretical validity and relevance as well as assessment of their applicability under Czech condition. For better imagination there is collected sample of results of selected externality values for foreign countries...|$|R
50|$|The {{different}} fan {{clubs and}} supporter groups are {{organized in the}} supporter union Fanverband RB Leipzig Fans. The supporter union was founded in 2013. It is an umbrella organization for official fan clubs, unofficial fan clubs and other supporter groups. 25 supporter groups are currently organized in the supporter union, as of 2016. Each supporter group in the supporter union is represented by two representatives. The representatives of the supporter groups meet every 4 to 6 weeks. The supporter union also holds a general meeting once per year. Even fans that are not members of a supporter group are welcome at the general meeting. The supporter union is represented by five to seven fan representatives, elected every second year. A maximum of five fan representatives are elected by {{the representatives of the}} supporter groups, two additional fan representatives are elected by the general assembly. A core function of the fan representatives is to serve as a direct link to the club. The fan representatives can hold talks with club officials, for example, to communicate requests, suggestions and criticism from the supporter base. In order to divide the work of the fan representatives, the supporter union has also created several working groups. The first general meeting was held in November 2014 and gathered 350 supporters. Present were also club officials, such as general manager Ulrich Wolter. Topics discussed at the first general meeting were a <b>conversion</b> of <b>sector</b> B into a standing area, open seating in sector B, the establishment of a family sector, the music volume at the stadium, club songs and catering, etc.|$|R
