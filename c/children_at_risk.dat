The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT).

25|$|Kindergarten {{has been}} shown to improve school {{readiness}} in <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> Children attending a kindergarten were less likely to have impaired speech or impaired motor development. Only 50% of children whose parents did not graduate from school are ready for school at age six. If such children were enrolled in a high-quality three-year Kindergarten programme, 87% were ready for school at age six. Thus Kindergarten helps to overcome unequal opportunities.|$|E

25|$|Articles 19 and 32-36 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child {{prohibits the}} {{exploitation}} of children in any form and in any context. Any child who is exposed to violence, exploitation or abuse {{can be considered a}} victim of crime and enjoys the correlated rights and entitlements, including access to assistance, protection and support, services for recovery and rehabilitation, access to justice, with due procedural safeguards in any related legal or administrative proceedings. <b>Children</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of exploitation have to be identified and recognised as being at risk. This implies that {{they have a right to}} assistance and support in order to prevent their exploitation or any other harm resulting from the risks. Considering the difficulties of identifying children who have been trafficked and the broad protection against all forms and contexts of exploitation afforded under the Convention, a child rights-based approach prioritises the identification of child victims of exploitation or other crime and <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> Whether or not exploitation takes place in a context of trafficking is of subordinate relevance for the child rights and protection context. It may interest primarily the law enforcement investigations and the prosecution.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimated}} cost-effectiveness of annually vaccinating <b>children</b> not <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> with inactivated {{influenza vaccine}} (IIV) {{to range from}} US $ 12, 000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved for children ages 6 - 23 months to $ 119, 000 per QALY saved for children ages 12 - 17 years. For <b>children</b> <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> (preexisting medical conditions) ages 6 - 35 months, vaccination with IIV was cost saving. For <b>children</b> <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> ages 3 - 17 years, vaccination cost $ 1, 000 -$ 10, 000 per QALY. Among <b>children</b> not <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> ages 5 - 17 years, live, attenuated influenza vaccine had a similar cost-effectiveness as IIV.

2500|$|Eye {{patching}} {{is used in}} the orthoptic {{management of}} <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of lazy eye (amblyopia), especially strabismic or anisometropic amblyopia. [...] These conditions can cause visual suppression of areas of the dissimilar images by the brain such as to avoid diplopia, resulting in a loss of visual acuity in the suppressed eye and in extreme cases in blindness in an otherwise functional eye. Patching the good eye forces the amblyopic eye to function, thereby causing vision in that eye to be retained. It is important to perform “near activities” (such as reading or handiwork) when patched, thereby exercising active, attentive vision.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Given the {{controversy}} of selecting a diagnostic and treatment approach for the febrile <b>child</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for occult bacteremia, {{the purpose of}} this study is to survey the diagnostic and treatment strategies chosen by pediatricians for a febrile <b>child</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for occult bacteremia seen in three different settings (private office, emergency department, their own child) to see if any differences exist. STUDY DESIGN: Survey of pediatricians given a case scenario of a febrile female child without a source of the fever presenting in three different clinical settings: 1) Office. 2) Emergency Department (E. D.). 3) Pediatrician's daughter. RESULTS: 138 pediatrician surveys were tabulated. Pediatricians ordered the most tests and empiric antibiotic treatments in the E. D., the fewest tests and empiric antibiotic treatments on their daughter, and intermediate frequency of tests and empiric antibiotic treatments in the office. Roughly half the pediatricians ordered the same level of tests in all three clinical settings, while the other half varied their test ordering in the different clinical settings. CONCLUSION: The clinical setting has an effect on the diagnostic and treatment strategies chosen when evaluating a febrile <b>child</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for occult bacteremia with patients seen in the E. D. receiving more laboratory tests and antibiotic treatment compared to office patients. Kinship also has an effect, with a child (daughter in this instance) of a pediatrician receiving the fewest laboratory tests and antibiotic treatment...|$|R
