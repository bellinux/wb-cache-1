40|$|We {{report on}} the {{experimental}} and analytical work on spin-transfer torque induced vortex dynamics in metallic nanopillars with in-plane magnetized layers. We study nanopillars with a diameter of 150 nm, containing two Fe layers with a thickness of 15 nm and 30 nm, respectively, separated by a 6 nm Ag spacer. The sample geometry is such that it allows {{for the formation of}} magnetic vortices in the Fe discs. As confirmed by micromagnetic simulations, we are able to prepare states where one magnetic layer is homogeneously magnetized while the other contains a vortex. We experimentally show that in this configuration spin-transfer torque can excite vortex dynamics and analyse their dependence on a magnetic field applied in the sample plane. The <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> is continuously dislocated from the disc centre, and the potential changes its shape with field strength. The latter is reflected in the field dependence of the excitation frequency. In the second part we propose a novel mechanism for the excitation of the gyrotropic mode in nanopillars with a perfectly homogeneously magnetized in-plane polarizing layer. We analytically show that in this configuration the vortex can absorb energy from the spin-polarized electric current if the angular spin-transfer efficiency function is asymmetric. This effect is supported by micromagnetic simulations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{reconsider the}} {{apparent}} conflict of conservation laws in cyclotron radiation discovered by Lieu et al (1983). We {{show that they}} did not correctly include the effects of radiation reaction in their calculation. When a ‘recoil ’ term, calculated using relativistic quantum theory, is included in the angular momentum of the particle the conflict disappears. We find that the guiding centre of the particle drifts outwards during cyclotron radiation. Recently several letters have been published on the subject of an apparent conflict of conservation laws in cyclotron emission (Lieu et a 1 1983, hereafter referred to as LLE; Lieu er a 1 1984, Lieu 1984), and on the resolution of this conflict (DasGupta 1984). The conflict arose in comparing two calculations of (d/dt) ri (here ri is the square of the distance of the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> of a particle orbit from the z axis of the coordinate system, with the magnetic field parallel to the z axis), using conservation of angular momentum and conservation of linear momentum respectively. In this letter we reconsider the calculation which uses the law of conservation of angular momentum. LLE use it to find the angular momentum of the electron by first calculating the angular momentum of the radiation field. Here we calculate the angular momentum of th...|$|E

5000|$|The electrogyration {{effect can}} be easy {{explained}} {{on the basis of}} Curie and Neumann symmetry principles. In the crystals that exhibit <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> symmetry, natural <b>gyration</b> can not exist, since, due to the Neumann principle, the point symmetry group of the medium should be a subgroup of the symmetry group that describes the phenomena, which are properties of this medium. As a result, the gyration tensor possessing a symmetry of second-rank axial tensor - [...] is not a subgroup of centrosymmetric media and so the natural optical activity cannot exist in such media. According to the Curie symmetry principle, external actions reduce the symmetry group of the medium down to the group defined by intersection of the symmetry groups of the action and the medium. When the electric field (with the symmetry of polar vector, [...] ) influences the crystal which possess the inversion centre, the symmetry group of the crystal should be lowered to the acentric one, thus permitting the appearance <b>of</b> <b>gyration.</b> However, in case of the quadratic electrogyration effect, the symmetry of the action should be considered as that of the dyad product [...] or, what is the same, the symmetry of a polar second-rank tensor (...) [...] Such a centrosymmetric action cannot lead to lowering of centrosymmetric symmetry of crystal to acentric states. This is the reason why the quadratic electrogyration exists only in the acentric crystals.|$|R

In contrast to other techniques typically used to study a-helices in isolation (such as nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism), small-angle X-ray scattering reports on the global structure of a molecule and, as such, provides complementary information to these other, more sequence-local measuring techniques.

The objectives of the study were specifically to outline a methodology for the correct estimation of the roll radius <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> <b>of</b> existing and new ships, to apply this methodology to a characteristic sample of existing Ro-Ro passenger ships, to review existing semi-empirical formulas for the determination of the roll radius <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> <b>of</b> Ro-Ro passenger ships, as suggested by IMO, and to conclude, finally, on the practical implications of the correct estimation and reproduction in model scale of the roll radius <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> to the validity of the Model Test results. The principal findings from the NTUA investigation were that existing, semiempirical formulas and approximations for the roll radius <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> do not account for the special features to typical Ro-Ro passenger ships designs and can lead to significantly erroneous results, that the radius <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> <b>of</b> modern Ro-Ro passenger ships is comparatively large, and that an underestimation of the actual roll radius <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> and its modeling according to Res. 14, SOLAS 95, will eventually lead to an increased tendency to capsize the ship model in the specified seastate conditions...|$|R

40|$|In {{mechanical}} dynamic problems, it {{is often}} necessary to know the radii <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> or equivalent mass moments of inertia of components and assemblies. Using the rotational pendulum technique described, one can easily measure the radii <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> about the polar and diametric axes of any rigid rotor without requiring a special fixture. The principals employed are also applicable to more complicated assemblies such as aircraft, boats, and cars, where the radius <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> and vehicle maneuverability are of interest. This description focuses on rotors. The relative values of polar and diametric radii <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> characterize some dynamic behavior and stability of spinning rotors. When the ratio of polar to diametric radii <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> approaches unity, the spinning rotor may exhibit undesirable dynamic behavior. Consequently, prior to high-speed spin testing the rotor or otherwise operating the assembly, it is desirable to have a simple and inexpensive procedure to directly measure the radii <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> <b>of</b> existing hardware. These data permit the technician to estimate the rotor dynamic behavior or identify potential problems prior to committing to operation. If sufficient part information is available, such as dimensions, geometry and material density, one can calculate the radii <b>of</b> <b>gyration.</b> For complicated parts, this can be time consuming. Often the technician does {{not have access to}} the rotor`s dimensional details to make the calculations. Hence, an inexpensive empirical technique such as the one described is valuable...|$|R
