5|$|After {{the conquest}} of the Pacific plain, the {{inhabitants}} paid tribute to the Spanish {{in the form of}} valuable products such as <b>cacao,</b> cotton, salt and vanilla, with an emphasis on <b>cacao.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alexander Shulgin says in {{his book}} PiHKAL, that he didn't observe any effects from 1600 mg phenethylamine alone. Also, Dr. Duke's Phyto{{chemical}} and Ethnobotanical Databases record on Theobroma <b>cacao</b> beans measure 5600 ppm (5.6 mg/g) phenylalanine, the chemical precursor to phenylethylamine. R. Gordon Wasson reports that <b>cacao</b> and magic mushroom is combined in traditional rituals used by Mexican shamans, including María Sabina.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj {{was one of}} {{a series}} of early sites on or near the Pacific coastal plain that were {{important}} commercial, ceremonial and political centres. It is apparent that it prospered from the production of <b>cacao</b> and from the trade routes that crossed the region. At the time of the Spanish Conquest in the 16th century the area was still important for its <b>cacao</b> production.|$|E
5|$|The highly {{specialised}} Manche production {{methods for}} annatto, <b>cacao</b> and vanilla were {{adopted by the}} incoming Q'eqchi' and are still applied on a small scale. Among the modern-day Q'eqchi', a tradition still exists that these orchards belong to their ancestors, the ch'olcuink spirits, who lack salt and swap <b>cacao</b> for it.|$|E
5|$|Pedro de Alvarado {{passed through}} Soconusco with a {{sizeable}} force in 1523, {{en route to}} conquer Guatemala. Alvarado's army included hardened veterans of the conquest of the Aztecs, and included cavalry and artillery; he {{was accompanied by a}} great many indigenous allies. Alvarado was received in peace in Soconusco, and the inhabitants swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown. They reported that neighbouring groups in Guatemala were attacking them because of their friendly outlook towards the Spanish. By 1524, Soconusco had been completely pacified by Alvarado and his forces. Due to the economic importance of <b>cacao</b> to the new colony, the Spanish were reluctant to move the indigenous inhabitants far from their established <b>cacao</b> orchards. As a result, the inhabitants of Soconusco {{were less likely to be}} rounded up into new reducción settlements than elsewhere in Chiapas, since the planting of a new <b>cacao</b> crop would have required five years to mature.|$|E
5|$|Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado {{passed through}} Soconusco with a {{sizeable}} force in 1523, {{en route to}} conquer Guatemala. Alvarado's army included hardened veterans of the conquest of the Aztecs, and included cavalry and artillery; there were also a great many indigenous allies from Cholula, Tenochtitlan, Tezcoco, Tlaxcala, and Xochimilco. Alvarado was received in peace in Soconusco, and the inhabitants swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown. They reported that neighbouring groups in Guatemala were attacking them because of their friendly outlook towards the Spanish. Alvarado's letter to Hernán Cortés describing his passage through Soconusco is lost, and knowledge of events there come from the account of Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who was not present, but related the report of Gonzalo de Alvarado. By 1524, Soconusco had been completely pacified by Alvarado and his forces. Over the next fifty years, native population levels collapsed catastrophically {{as a result of}} exposure to Old World diseases, with an estimated 90–95% drop. In spite of this, the colonial administration demanded twice as much tribute in <b>cacao</b> as had been paid to the Aztecs prior to the Spanish invasion, and <b>cacao</b> continued to be an important crop throughout the colonial period. Due to the economic importance of <b>cacao</b> to the new colony, the Spanish were reluctant to move the indigenous inhabitants far from their established <b>cacao</b> orchards. As a result, the inhabitants of Soconusco {{were less likely to be}} rounded up into new reducción settlements, where the planting of a new <b>cacao</b> crop would have required five years to mature.|$|E
5|$|The Motagua River flows {{down from}} the western Guatemalan highlands, and Quiriguá was ideally {{positioned}} to control the trade of uncut jade, the majority of which {{was found in the}} middle reaches of the Motagua Valley, as well as controlling the flow of other important commodities up and down the river such as <b>cacao,</b> which was produced as a local cash crop. Although <b>cacao</b> was produced for trade, maize remained the primary local crop due to its central role in the Maya diet. In addition, maize probably formed an important component in the site's tribute payments to its overlords at Copán, a city that was exhausting its own local resources. Although little jade has been recovered from the site, there is evidence for trade in obsidian originating from the Ixtepeque source situated near {{the upper reaches of the}} Motagua.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{staples of}} the Maya diet were maize, beans, and squashes. These were {{supplemented}} {{with a wide}} variety of other plants either cultivated in gardens or gathered in the forest. At Joya de Cerén, a volcanic eruption preserved a record of foodstuffs stored in Maya homes, among them were chilies and tomatoes. Cotton seeds were in the process of being ground, perhaps to produce cooking oil. In addition to basic foodstuffs, the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton, <b>cacao</b> and vanilla. <b>Cacao</b> was especially prized by the elite, who consumed chocolate beverages. Cotton was spun, dyed, and woven into valuable textiles in order to be traded.|$|E
5|$|The three {{principal}} kingdoms of Cuscatlan, Izalco, and Chaparrastique {{engaged in}} regular warfare, and smaller groups occasionally rebelled against their larger neighbours. There was flourishing trade, with <b>cacao</b> {{as the principal}} commodity, although maize, cotton, and balsam were also traded.|$|E
5|$|Common {{and often}} basic {{ingredients}} in many modern European cuisines like potatoes, kidney beans, <b>cacao,</b> vanilla, tomatoes, chili peppers and maize {{were not available}} to Europeans until after 1492, after European contact with the Americas, and even then it often took considerable time, sometimes several centuries, for the new foodstuffs {{to be accepted by}} society at large.|$|E
5|$|Soconusco was an {{important}} communication route between the central Mexican highlands and Central America. It had been subjugated by the Aztec Triple Alliance {{at the end of}} the 15th century, under the emperor Ahuizotl, and paid tribute in <b>cacao.</b> The highland K'iche' dominated the Pacific coastal plain of western Guatemala. The eastern portion of the Pacific plain was occupied by the non-Maya Pipil and Xinca.|$|E
5|$|The Manche Ch'ol {{lacked a}} complex {{political}} organisation, and possessed no large towns within their territory. Their largest settlement was Manche itself, with about one hundred multi-family houses. Manche {{was also the}} name of the principal lineage at Manche and this lineage was the origin of the populations of the other Manche Ch'ol towns. Nito was another principal settlement, and an important port for maritime trade that maintained strong links with places as far away as the province of Acalan in what is now southern Campeche in Mexico. Otherwise, the Manche Ch'ol lived in generally small settlements governed by one or more chieftains; they were less politically complex than their Lakandon and Itza neighbours, and were not ruled by a principal king or chieftain. They grew relatively little maize, rather concentrating their agricultural production upon the prestige crops of <b>cacao,</b> annatto and vanilla. All the main settlements, both on the coast and inland, were noted for their prodigious <b>cacao</b> and annatto plantations.|$|E
5|$|At least 120 drugs {{come from}} plant sources, {{many of them}} from the bark of trees. Quinine {{originates}} from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was for a long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria. Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma <b>cacao),</b> the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).|$|E
5|$|By 1539, the Spanish {{advances}} in El Salvador were sufficient that Cuscatlan was considered fully pacified. In {{the immediate aftermath}} of the Spanish conquest, the conquistadors sought wealth through slaving and mining, but both of these industries soon faltered, and the colonists instead turned to agriculture. In 1545, San Salvador was moved to its current location, and on 27 September 1546, it was elevated in status to a city. El Salvador originally formed three administrative divisions, those of Sonsonate (Izalcos), San Salvador (Cuscatlan), and San Miguel. Sonsonate was an alcaldía mayor, while San Salvador, San Miguel, and Choluteca (now in Honduras) formed the alcaldía mayor of San Salvador. From 1524, all of these fell within the jurisdiction of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala. In 1542, this jurisdiction was reorganised as the Real Audiencia de Guatemala, and later the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Ecclesiastically, all of El Salvador fell within the Roman Catholic diocese of Guatemala. The native inhabitants of the Izalco region of El Salvador, famed for its prodigious production of <b>cacao,</b> were among the most heavily exploited in the whole Spanish Empire. By the end of the 16th century, this had led to the collapse of <b>cacao</b> production in the province.|$|E
5|$|In 1699 a Spanish {{expedition}} {{under the}} command of sergeant Martín de Montoya was sent from the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza (formerly Nojpetén) to investigate Indian activity in the former Ch'ol and Mopan territories. He found evidence that there were still surviving Maya in all the lands he crossed, as evidenced by the carefully tended <b>cacao</b> and vanilla orchards. At this time there were said to be 400 relocated Maya from the same area living in Belén.|$|E
5|$|In the 1820s, Brazil {{exported}} 11,000tons of <b>cacao</b> and by 1880 {{this had}} increased to 73,500tons. Between 1821 and 1825, 41,174tons of sugar were exported, rising to 238,074tons between 1881 and 1885. Until 1850, rubber production was insignificant, but between 1881 and 1890, it had reached third place among Brazilian exports. This was about 81tons between 1827 and 1830 reaching 1,632tons in 1852. By 1900 {{the country was}} exporting 24,301,452tons of rubber. Brazil also exported around 3,377,000tons of coffee between 1821 and 1860 while between 1861 and 1889 this reached 6,804,000tons. Technological innovations {{also contributed to the}} growth of exports, in particular the adoption of steam navigation and railroads allowed for faster and more convenient cargo transportation.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} main trade routes {{used by the}} Manche Ch'ol; the first went north along the Mopan River to Chacchilan, then {{overland}} to Nojpetén. The second followed the Cancuén River to Yol, and there joined the Pasión River northwards, leaving the river when it turned west and continuing overland to Nojpetén. Xocmo, on the Sacapulas River, was a trading port where the Manche and Lakandon Ch'ols met to trade <b>cacao</b> and annatto. Xocmo had a major fair, still taking place as late as 1676, where traders arrived from various colonial and independent settlements; these included Nojpetén and the towns of Cobán, San Agustín Lanquín and Sacapulas in colonial Verapaz. The Chols traded <b>cacao</b> and annatto into the encomienda towns of Verapaz in exchange for metal tools (particularly axes and machetes) and salt. Other products traded to the Manche by the Q'eqchi' of colonial Verapaz included cotton textiles and quetzal feathers. The Q'eqchi' used this trade to supply products demanded by their Spanish overlords under the repartimiento system. The Manche produced a number of products for trade, manufactured from resources in the southern Maya Mountains of Belize; these included blowguns, bows and arrows, finely sculpted greenstone axes, hammocks, manos and metates, pottery, and cane, {{all of which were}} traded across the southern Maya region.|$|E
5|$|Trade routes {{not only}} {{supplied}} physical goods, they facilitated {{the movement of}} people and ideas throughout Mesoamerica. Shifts in trade routes occurred with {{the rise and fall}} of important cities in the Maya region, and have been identified in every major reorganization of the Maya civilization, such as the rise of Preclassic Maya civilization, the transition to the Classic, and the Terminal Classic collapse. Even the Spanish Conquest did not immediately terminate all Maya trading activity; for example, the Contact period Manche Ch'ol traded the prestige crops of <b>cacao,</b> annatto and vanilla into colonial Verapaz.|$|E
5|$|In 1678 the Manche Ch'ol {{population}} was devastated by disease; {{in the area}} around the town of San Lucas Tzalac it killed every child under six years old and almost all of those under the age of ten. Total deaths, including adults, numbered over 400 and the epidemic prompted all the Manche Ch'ol in the affected region to abandon the mission towns and flee into the forest. The Spanish made a number of further attempts to pacify the Manche Ch'ol, but these were ultimately unsuccessful, and the Manche Ch'ol rebelled in 1689. In that year many Manche Ch'ol were forcibly relocated to the Urrán Valley in the highlands, resulting in the abandonment of many of the Manche orchards; this eventually led to the collapse of the regional trade network that by then had been fully linked with colonial Guatemala and supplied it with unknown quantities of <b>cacao.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pedro II was acclaimed, crowned and consecrated on 18 July 1841. He {{wore a white}} robe {{that had}} belonged to his {{grandfather}} Francis II, an orange pallium made of feathers from the Guianan cock-of-the-rock (a homage to Brazil's birds and indigenous Brazilian chieftains) woven by Tiriyó Indians especially for the emperor and a green mantle emblazoned with branches of <b>cacao</b> and tobacco, both symbols of the Brazilian empire. After being anointed, he received the Imperial insignia (the Imperial Regalia of Brazil): the Sword (which had belonged to his father), the Scepter (of pure gold with a wyvern on its tip, symbol of the House of Braganza), the Imperial Crown (made especially for the coronation with jewels removed from Pedro I’s crown), the Globe, and the Hand of Justice.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises range across {{tropical}} and subtropical {{regions and}} {{are found in}} primary and secondary rainforests, as well as bamboo groves and mangrove forests. They prefer forests with high, dense canopies, although some species have also been found in disturbed habitats, such as <b>cacao</b> plantations and mixed-crop home gardens. Due largely to their nocturnal behavior and the subsequent difficulties in accurately quantifying abundance, data about the population size or distribution patterns of slow lorises is limited. In general, encounter rates are low; a combined analysis of several field studies involving transect surveys conducted in South and Southeast Asia determined encounter rates ranging from as high as 0.74lorises per kilometer for N.coucang to as low as 0.05lorises per kilometer for N.pygmaeus.|$|E
5|$|The Manche Ch'ol were {{integrated}} into a regional trade network that included their Itza and Lakandon Ch'ol neighbours, and involved the exchange of Manche produce such as <b>cacao,</b> annatto and vanilla for salt, the only Maya source of which was controlled by the Itza after the Spanish conquest of the province of Acalan. This trade monopoly was maintained by force {{on the part of}} the Itza, who vigorously ensured that the Manche Ch'ol remained subservient to them. After the Manche towns on the coast of Belize fell under Spanish control in the 16th century, they continued to have close links with the independent inland Manche settlements. Trade continued and intermarriage was common. The towns in the Cancuén River drainage traded via land and riverine routes with both the independent Itza (notably with Nojpetén) and with colonial Verapaz (principally with Cobán and Cahabón).|$|E
5|$|The central {{highlands}} {{were occupied}} {{by a number of}} Maya peoples, including the Tzotzil, who were divided into a number of provinces; the province of Chamula was said to have five small towns grouped closely together. The Tojolabal were another Maya people, with territory around Comitán. The Coxoh Maya held territory in {{the upper reaches of the}} Grijalva drainage, near the Guatemalan border, and were probably a subgroup of the Tojolabal. Soconusco was an important communication route between the central Mexican highlands and Central America. It had been subjugated by the Aztec Triple Alliance at the end of the 15th century, under the emperor Ahuizotl, and paid tribute in <b>cacao.</b> The Cholan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning eastern Chiapas and southwestern Petén in Guatemala. The Lakandon had a fierce reputation amongst the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|The first Catholic missionaries entered {{southern}} Petén in 1596 {{to convert}} the Manche Ch'ol and the Mopan. The Q'eqchi' of Verapaz long had close ties with the Manche Ch'ol. The colonial Maya towns of Cobán and Cahabón, in Alta Verapaz, traded quetzal feathers, copal, chile, cotton, salt and Spanish-produced iron tools with their lowland Lakandon and Manche Ch'ol neighbours, receiving <b>cacao</b> and achiote in exchange. Many Q'eqchi' from Verapaz fled Spanish control to settle among the Lakandón and Manche Ch'ol. These fugitives strengthened the existing ties between the independent Ch'ol and the Spanish-controlled Maya of Verapaz; the constant flow of Maya between colonial Verapaz and independent Petén led to religious syncretism that the Spanish religious authorities were unable to prevent. This relationship did not hinder the Spanish from using the Q'eqchi' to help conquer and reduce the Manche Ch'ol.|$|E
5|$|Commoners are {{estimated}} to have comprised over 90% of the population, but relatively {{little is known about}} them. Their houses were generally constructed from perishable materials, and their remains have left little trace in the archaeological record. Some commoner dwellings were raised on low platforms, and these can be identified, but an unknown quantity of commoner houses were not. Such low-status dwellings can only be detected by extensive remote-sensing surveys of apparently empty terrain. The range of commoners was broad; it consisted of everyone not of noble birth, and therefore included everyone from the poorest farmers to wealthy craftsmen and commoners appointed to bureaucratic positions. Commoners engaged in essential production activities, including that of products destined for use by the elite, such as cotton and <b>cacao,</b> as well as subsistence crops for their own use, and utilitarian items such as ceramics and stone tools. Commoners took part in warfare, and could advance socially by proving themselves as outstanding warriors. Commoners paid taxes to the elite in the form of staple goods such as maize flour and game. It is likely that hard-working commoners who displayed exceptional skills and initiative could become influential members of Maya society.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July 1502, {{during his}} fourth voyage, Christopher Columbus arrived at Guanaja, {{one of the}} Bay Islands {{off the coast of}} Honduras. He sent his brother Bartholomew to scout the island. As Bartholomew {{explored}} the island with two boats, a large canoe approached from the west, apparently en route to the island. The canoe was carved from one large tree trunk and was powered by twenty-five naked rowers. Curious as to the visitors, Bartholomew Columbus seized and boarded it. He found it was a Maya trading canoe from Yucatán, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo that included ceramics, cotton textiles, yellow stone axes, flint-studded war clubs, copper axes and bells, and <b>cacao.</b> Also among the cargo were a small number of women and children, probably destined to be sold as slaves, as were a number of the rowers. The Europeans looted whatever took their interest from amongst the cargo and seized the elderly Maya captain to serve as an interpreter; the canoe was then allowed to continue on its way. It is likely that news of the piratical strangers in the Caribbean passed along the Maya trade routes.|$|E
5|$|Some rodent {{species are}} serious {{agricultural}} pests, eating {{large quantities of}} food stored by humans. For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia {{was estimated to be}} enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by {{a relatively small number of}} species, chiefly rats and mice. In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, vegetables and <b>cacao.</b> In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers.|$|E
5|$|The game is turn-based. Each turn {{represents}} one week, and travelling between cities takes {{a number of}} turns depending on {{the proximity of the}} destination city. Many cities have a chocolate shop, where the player can sell his or her stock, and a market where ingredients can be purchased. Some specialty <b>cacao</b> beans can only be purchased from plantations in certain cities. Factories manufacturing chocolates produce a set amount of product every turn, as long as the required ingredients are in stock. During story mode, quests are given by non-player characters; these typically involve producing a particular volume and type of chocolate and delivering it to another non-player character, who is either traveling or can be found at a set location. Quest rewards {{take the form of a}} high price for the chocolates or a new recipe. Some encounters with characters give the player an opportunity to gamble a large amount of money on a dice roll. Market owners can be bartered with, though this carries the risk of them becoming irritated and raising prices rather than lowering them.|$|E
5|$|Trees are {{the source}} of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma <b>cacao)</b> are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than do other nuts. A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July 1502, {{during his}} fourth voyage, Christopher Columbus arrived at Guanaja, {{one of the}} Bay Islands {{off the coast of}} Honduras.

The Europeans looted whatever took their interest from amongst the cargo and seized the elderly Maya captain to serve as an interpreter; the canoe was then allowed to continue on its way. This was the first recorded contact between Europeans and the Maya. It is likely that news of the piratical strangers in the Caribbean passed along the Maya trade routes – the first prophecies of bearded invaders sent by Kukulkan, the northern Maya feathered serpent god, were probably recorded around this time, and in due course passed into the books of Chilam Balam.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cacao</b> trees grow in {{a limited}} {{geographical}} zone, of about 20° {{to the north and}} south of the Equator. Nearly 70% of the world crop today is grown in West Africa. The <b>cacao</b> plant was first given its botanical name by Swedish natural scientist Carl Linnaeus in his original classification of the plant kingdom, where he called it Theobroma ("food of the gods") <b>cacao.</b>|$|E
25|$|An early Classic-period (460–480 AD) Mayan tomb {{from the}} site in Rio Azul had vessels with the Maya glyph for <b>cacao</b> on them with residue of a {{chocolate}} drink, suggests the Maya were drinking chocolate around 400AD. Documents in Maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes, in addition to everyday life. The Maya grew <b>cacao</b> trees in their backyards, and used the <b>cacao</b> seeds the trees produced to make a frothy, bitter drink.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cacao</b> beans {{also have}} a {{potential}} {{to be used as}} a bedding material in farms for cows. Using <b>cacao</b> bean husks in bedding material for cows had beneficial effects on udder health (results in less bacterial growth) and ammonia levels (less ammonia levels on bedding).|$|E
25|$|The new craze for {{chocolate}} {{brought with it}} a thriving slave market, as between the early 1600s and late 1800s, the laborious and slow processing of the <b>cacao</b> bean was manual. <b>Cacao</b> plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, <b>cacao</b> production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate was {{introduced}} to Europe by the Spaniards, and became a popular beverage by the mid-17th century. Spaniards also introduced the <b>cacao</b> tree into the West Indies and the Philippines. It was also introduced {{into the rest of}} Asia and into West Africa by Europeans. In the Gold Coast, modern Ghana, <b>cacao</b> {{was introduced}} by a Ghanaian, Tetteh Quarshie.|$|E
25|$|Unsweetened {{chocolate}} is pure chocolate liquor, {{also known as}} bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, {{often referred to as}} raw <b>cacao,</b> is always dark and a minimum of 75% <b>cacao.</b>|$|E
