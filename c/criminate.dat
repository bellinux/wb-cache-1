500|$|Even if Tom wasn't {{armed with}} a revolver, Virgil Earp testified Tom {{attempted}} to grab a rifle from the scabbard on the horse {{in front of him}} before he was killed. Judge Spicer ruled afterward that [...] "if Thomas McLaury was one of a party who were thus armed and were making felonious resistance to an arrest, and in the melee that followed was shot, the fact of his being unarmed, if it be a fact, could not of itself <b>criminate</b> the defendants , if they were not otherwise criminated." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the court}} martial {{testimony}} was critical of Bligh's conduct—by {{the time of his}} return to England in August 1793, following his successful conveyance of breadfruit to the West Indies aboard Providence, professional and public opinion had turned against him. He was snubbed at the Admiralty when he went to present his report, and was left on half pay for 19 months before receiving his next appointment. In late 1794 the jurist Edward Christian, brother of Fletcher, published his Appendix to the court martial proceedings, which was said by the press to [...] "palliate the behaviour of Christian and the Mutineers, and to <b>criminate</b> Captain Bligh". Bligh's position was further undermined when the loyalist gunner Peckover confirmed that much of what was alleged in the Appendix was true.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after his}} release, Heywood {{had written to}} Edward Christian, Fletcher's older brother, that he would [...] "endeavour to prove that your brother was not that vile wretch, void of all {{gratitude}} ... but, on the contrary, a most worthy character ... beloved by all (except one, whose ill report is his greatest praise)". This statement, published immediately after Heywood's pardon in a local Whitehaven newspaper as {{an open letter to}} Edward Christian, contradicted the respect Heywood had accorded Bligh in the courtroom, and, in turn, it led to the publication in late 1794 of Edward Christian's Appendix to the court martial proceedings. Presented as an account of the [...] "real causes and circumstances of that Unhappy Transaction", the Appendix was said by the press to [...] "palliate the behaviour of Christian and the Mutineers, and to <b>criminate</b> Captain Bligh". In the controversy that followed, Bligh's rebuttals could not silence doubts as to his own conduct, and his position was further undermined when William Peckover, a Bligh loyalist, confirmed that the allegations in the Appendix were substantially accurate.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nay, if ye {{object to}} the {{question}} {{on the ground that}} a true ainswer will be <b>criminating</b> yoursel', ye'll be justified in so doing, by reason and propriety; but then ye'll consider well the consequences it may have on your own case, when that comes to be investigated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Mannion: I {{have got}} {{his letter to}} her. She is <b>criminated</b> by it, even past her father's contradiction--and he doesn't stick at a trifle! But I'll begin at the beginning, and tell you everything. Hang it, Basil, you look as if I'd brought you bad news instead of good!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Am I to <b>criminate</b> myself, sir?" [...] said Mr. Mollett, {{still in}} the humblest voice in the world, and hardly above his breath.|$|E
60|$|He stopped abruptly, for he {{felt that}} in {{whatever}} way he might attempt to clear himself, he would unavoidably <b>criminate,</b> by implication, his absent mate.|$|E
60|$|The cowed {{driver was}} {{beginning}} {{a long string}} of <b>criminating</b> explanations, when turning to Pierre, the policeman calmly desired him to re-enter the coach; he would see him safely at his destination; and then seating himself beside the driver on the box, commanded him to tell the number given him by the gentleman.|$|R
60|$|XX. It is mournful {{to think}} how many recent writers have <b>criminated</b> our Church in {{consequence}} of their ignorance and inadvertence in not knowing, or not noticing, the contradistinction here meant between power and authority. Rites and ceremonies the Church may ordain jure proprio: on matters of faith her judgment is to be received with reverence, and not gainsayed but after repeated inquiries, and on weighty grounds.|$|R
60|$|The {{fact that}} Lady Byron, under the severest temptations and the bitterest insults and injuries, {{withheld}} every word by which Lord Byron could be <b>criminated,</b> {{so long as}} he and his sister were living, is strong evidence, that, when she did speak, it was not under the influence of ill- will, but of pure conscientious convictions; and the fullest weight ought, therefore, to be given to her testimony.|$|R

60|$|To {{this the}} king {{replied that he}} had never {{intended}} to call them traitors; and that when they would recall their declarations and votes stigmatizing those who adhered to him as traitors, he would recall his proclamations. Thus messages passed back and forth two or three times, each party <b>criminating</b> the other, and neither willing to make the concessions which the other required. At last all hope of an accommodation was abandoned, and both sides prepared for war.|$|R
60|$|Mildred was silent. She {{could not}} vindicate her friend without <b>criminating</b> her father. As for Wycherly, {{he would have}} given a year's income to be at sea; yet he shrunk from {{wounding}} the poor daughter's feelings by letting her know he overheard the dialogue. This indecision made him the unwilling auditor of a conversation that he ought not to have heard--an occurrence which, had there been time for reflection, he would have taken means to prevent.|$|R
60|$|But supposing these {{witnesses}} {{to be good}} for anything, supposing it fit that the least attention should be paid them, the matter of their testimony may very possibly be true without <b>criminating</b> the Begum. It <b>criminates</b> Saadut Ali Khân, the brother of the Nabob; the word Begum is never mentioned in the crimination but in conjunction with his; and much the greater part of it <b>criminates</b> the Nabob himself. Now, my Lords, I will say, that the matter of these affidavits, forgetting who the deponents were, may possibly be true, as far as respects Saadut Ali Khân, but that it is utterly as improbable, which is the main point and the stress of the thing, with respect to the Begums, as it is impossible with respect to the Nabob. That Saadut Ali, being a military man, a man ambitious and aspiring to greatness, should take advantage of the abuses of the English government and of the discontent of the country, that he should, I say, raise a revolt against his brother is very possible; but it is scarcely within possibility that the mother of the Nabob should have joined with the illegitimate son against her legitimate son. I can only say that in human affairs there is the possibility of truth in this. It is possible she might wish to depose her legitimate son, her only legitimate son, and to depose him {{for the sake of a}} bastard son of her husband's,--to exalt him at the expense of the former, and to exalt, of course, the mother of that bastard at her own expense, and to her own wrong. But I say, that this, though possible, is grossly improbable. The reason why the Begum is implicated in this charge with Saadut Ali by the affidavits cannot escape your notice. Their own acquittal might be the only object of the deponents in their crimination of the latter; but the treasures of the former were the objects of their employers, and these treasures could not be come at but by the destruction of the Begums.|$|R

6000|$|You would {{naturally}} have imagined, that, in the House of Commons, where {{clouds of}} witnesses {{had been before}} produced by the friends and agents of Mr. Hastings, he would then have brought forward Sir John to contradict this reported offer; but not a word from Sir John D'Oyly. At last he is examined before the Committee of Managers. He refuses to answer. Why? Because his answers might <b>criminate</b> himself. My Lords, every answer {{that most of them}} have been required to make they are sensible they cannot make without danger of criminating themselves, being all involved in the crimes of the prisoner. He has corrupted and ruined the whole service; there {{is not one of them}} that dares appear and give a fair and full answer in any case, as you have seen in Mr. Middleton, and many others at your bar. [...] "I will not answer this question," [...] they say, [...] "because it tends to <b>criminate</b> myself." [...] How comes it that the Company's servants are not able to give evidence in the affairs of Mr. Hastings, without its tending to <b>criminate</b> themselves? ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a painful}} pause, {{which was at}} length broken by the {{innocent}} defendant.

6000|$|... "I {{believe as}} you do, my boy, and {{will send a}} man to the barn you speak of this very night, {{although}} so much time has now elapsed that I have no hope of finding anything <b>criminating.</b> However, regardless of what may happen, I believe we can show that the fakir was not the guilty party, and, to guard against a possible attack by your uncle, {{it will be necessary}} to know exactly where we can get bail in case you should be arrested." ...|$|R
60|$|I shall now {{proceed to}} state to your Lordships, that this Debi Sing, {{fortified}} by this protection, which was extended {{even to the}} lowest of his instruments, thought it high time to assume the superiority that belonged to a personage who had the Governor-General for his pensioner. No longer the sneaking tone of apology; no longer the modest allegations that the commissioner was misinformed;--he boldly accuses the representative of English government of forgery in order to destroy him; he <b>criminates</b> and recriminates, and lays about him without mercy.|$|R
60|$|The next {{subject for}} your Lordships' {{consideration}} {{is the principle}} of the prisoner's defence. And here we must observe, that, either by confession or conviction, we are possessed of the facts, and perfectly agreed upon the matter at issue between us. In taking a view of the laws by which you are to judge, I shall beg leave to state to you upon what principles of law the House of Commons has <b>criminated</b> him, and upon what principles of law, or pretended law, he justifies himself: for these are the matters at issue between us; the matters of fact, as I have just said, being determined either by confession on his part or by proof on ours.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{decline to}} give it," [...] said Mr. Boxer, with great relish. [...] "It ain’t likely I’m {{going to give}} myself away like that; besides, it’s agin the law {{for a man to}} <b>criminate</b> himself. You go on and start your bigamy case, and call old red-eyes as a witness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, my lad, don't say {{anything}} to <b>criminate</b> yourself," [...] he began; [...] "the less you talk, the better for you.

6000|$|Alexander {{seized a}} javelin to hurl at Clitus's head. The guests rose in confusion, and with many outcries pressed around him. Some seized Alexander's arm, some began to hurry Clitus {{out of the}} room, and some were engaged in loudly <b>criminating</b> and {{threatening}} each other. They got Clitus out of the apartment, {{but as soon as}} he was in the hall he broke away from them, returned by another door, and began to renew his insults to Alexander. The king hurled his javelin and struck Clitus down, saying, at the same time, [...] "Go, then, and join Philip and Parmenio." [...] The company rushed to the rescue of the unhappy man, but it was too late. He died almost immediately.|$|R
60|$|That {{every part}} of this transaction, from the {{monopoly}} with which it commenced, to the contraband dealing with which it concluded, <b>criminates</b> the said Warren Hastings with wilful disobedience of orders and a continued breach of trust; that every step taken in it was attended with heavy loss to the Company, and with a sacrifice of their interest to that of individuals; and that, if finally a profit had resulted to the Company from such a transaction, no profit attending it could compensate for the probable risk to which their trade in China was thereby exposed, or for the certain dishonor and consequent distrust which the East India Company must incur {{in the eyes of}} the Chinese government by being engaged in a low, clandestine traffic, prohibited by the laws of the country.|$|R
60|$|Having stated before {{whom the}} {{evidence}} collected in {{this body of}} affidavits was taken, I shall now state who the persons were that gave it. They were those very persons who were guilty of robbing and ruining the whole country: yes, my Lords, the very persons who {{had been accused of}} this in the mass by Mr. Hastings himself. They were nothing less than the whole body of those English officers who were usurping the office of farmers-general, and other lucrative offices in the Nabob's government, and whose pillage and peculations had raised a revolt of the whole kingdom against themselves. These persons are here brought in a mass to clear themselves of this charge by <b>criminating</b> other persons, and clandestinely imputing to them the effect of their own iniquity.|$|R
6000|$|...

60|$|The evening {{edition of}} the paper stated that the {{greatest}} excitement still continued in the Quartier St. Roch--that the premises in question had been carefully re-searched, and fresh examinations of witnesses instituted, but all to no purpose.

40|$|AbstractFor {{the purpose}} of an {{efficient}} retrieval of impressive scenes from lifelog videos, we propose an emotional scene detection method based on facial expression recognition. Most of conventional facial expression recognition methods focus on dis- <b>criminating</b> typical facial expressions such as happiness, sadness and surprise, while lifelog videos contain various facial expressions. In addition, many training examples, which are quite troublesome to prepare, are required to construct the facial expression recognition models. The proposed method tries to solve these problems by constructing a facial expression recogni- tion model using an unsupervised learning based on Gaussian mixture model. Since our model is unsupervised, {{there is no need}} for preparing learning examples and predefining the types of facial expressions. The detection performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency through several emotional scene detection experiments...|$|R
60|$|Let anyone {{imagine the}} frightful {{constraint}} and solitude implied in this sentence. Let anyone, too, think of its painful complications in life. The roots of a falsehood are far-reaching. Conduct {{that can only}} be explained by <b>criminating</b> another must often seem unreasonable and unaccountable; and the most truthful person, who feels bound to keep silence regarding a radical lie of another, must often be placed in positions most trying to conscientiousness. The great merit of 'Caleb Williams' as a novel consists in its philosophical analysis of the utter helplessness of an innocent person who agrees to keep the secret of a guilty one. One sees there how that necessity of silence produces all the effect of falsehood on his part, and deprives him of the confidence and sympathy of those with whom he would take refuge.|$|R
60|$|There followed, {{after this}} scene, {{a long and}} dreadful quarrel. Charles accused his wife of {{unreasonable}} and foolish jealousy, and of putting a public insult upon {{one of the ladies}} of his court, whom she was bound to treat with civility and respect, since he chose to have it so. She, on the other hand, declared that he was cruel and tyrannical in making such demands upon her, and that she would go back to Portugal rather than submit to such an intolerable indignity. She <b>criminated</b> Charles, and Charles recriminated and threatened her, and for one night the palace was filled with the noise and uproar of the quarrel. The ladies and gentlemen of the household were very glad, they said, that they were not in London, where there would have been so many more witnesses of the scene.|$|R
