25|$|The {{numbering}} in Frith Street {{seems to}} have altered more than once, but the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>address</b> from No. 15 to No. 20 appears to be chiefly due to the building of more houses {{on the site of}} Monmouth House after it was demolished in 1773.

25|$|If a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>address</b> causes an {{individual}} {{to move to another}} electorate (electoral division), they are legally obliged to notify the AEC within 8 weeks. The AEC monitors house and apartment sales and sends a reminder (and the forms) to new residents if they have moved to another electorate, making compliance with the law easier. The AEC conducts periodic door-to-door and postal campaigns to try to ensure that all eligible persons are registered in the correct electorate.|$|E

Residents are required by law to report any <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>address</b> to register within a short time after moving.

Most banks also enable a customer to download copies of bank statements, which can be printed at the customer's premises (some banks charge a fee for mailing hard copies of bank statements). Some banks also enable customers to download transactions directly into the customer's accounting software.

25|$|In 2001, {{potential}} ethics violations arose over {{use of a}} state {{cell phone}} and state vehicle for personal use. Soon after, a previously tabled bill in the legislature that would change Bunn’s office to an appointed position in lieu of an election was reintroduced. The legislation never made it into law. While an ethics investigation was pending, it came to light in 2001 that Bunn was delinquent on almost $15,000 in property taxes. The taxes were owed in two counties, some {{as far back as}} 1997, with one property facing foreclosure by the county. County records disclosed a pattern of late payments on property taxes dating to as early as 1992. Bunn paid all the back taxes, including interest, and apologized for the transgression, blaming it partly on a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>address</b> due to selling his law firm and on not having the money after leaving private legal practice.|$|E

The Act also specifies that Elections Canada may obtain information from other jurisdictions, such as from [...] provincial and territorial motor vehicle registrars, and provincial electoral agencies with permanent voters lists. Since 1999, Elections Canada [...] has convened the Advisory Committee of Electoral Partners annually (known as the National Register of Electors Advisory Committee until 2008), usually in November in Ottawa, to discuss the permanent elector databases, data sharing arrangements, and other related topics.|$|E

The website that posted it, Pitchfork Media, was ordered by the court to provide the interview's footage after they removed it three months prior. On December 31, 2012, Keef was issued a judicial summons for a new and unrelated alleged parole violation. Prosecutors claimed that he failed to notify his juvenile parole officer about a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>address.</b> A hearing was set for January 2, 2013.

2500|$|Even more {{important}} a driver of change was the need, for administrative purposes, {{to develop a}} system under which each individual had a [...] "stable" [...] name from birth to death. In the old days, people would be known by their name, patronymic and the farm they lived at. This last element would change if a person got a new job, bought a new farm, or otherwise came to live somewhere else. (This {{is part of the}} origin, {{in this part of the}} world, of the custom of women changing their names upon marriage. Originally it indicated, basically, a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>address,</b> and from older times, there are numerous examples of men doing the same thing). The many patronymic names may derive from the fact that people who moved from the country to the cities, also gave up the name of the farm they came from. As a worker, you passed by your father's name, and this name passed on to the next generation as a family name. Einar Gerhardsen, the Norwegian prime minister, used a true patronym, as his father was named Gerhard Olsen (Gerhard, the son of Ola). Gerhardsen passed his own patronym on to his children as a family name. This has been common in many working-class families. The tradition of keeping the farm name as a family name got stronger during the first half of the 20th century in Norway.|$|E
