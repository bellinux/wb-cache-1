40|$|This {{project is}} part of a {{collaborative}} MSc training programme between the Aviation Industries of China (AVIC) and Cranfield University, aiming at enhancing the competitiveness of AVIC in both international and domestic aviation market through applying <b>continuing</b> <b>airworthiness</b> policies in the whole aircraft development process. The arrangement of the research project is that all students start with a Group Design Project which is based on the Flying Crane Project provided by AVIC. Individual research projects will address some aspects of the Flying Crane Project during the Group Design Project, and then further developed during the period for individual projects. The aim of this research is to apply the airworthiness requirements and the methodology of the Maintenance Steering Group logic (MSG- 3) in the Flying Crane Project. This is because that maintenance {{is one of the key}} factors of <b>Continuing</b> <b>Airworthiness,</b> and MSG- 3 logic is the most accepted and approved method to develop scheduled maintenance for civil aircrafts. The main objectives of this project include: (1) To investigate current <b>Continuing</b> <b>Airworthiness</b> regulations, including European airworthiness requirements (as the main regulation to comply with) and Chinese airworthiness regulations (as an important reference and supplement to the research); (2) To investigate the main analysis methodology of reliability and maintainability, including Damage Tolerance and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA); (3) To analyse the data resulted from the Group Design Project using MSG- 3 logic to produce a set of <b>Continuing</b> <b>Airworthiness</b> instructions, for the operator and maintenance organisation of the aircraft, from the design organization’s perspective; (4) To develop <b>Continuing</b> <b>Airworthiness</b> instructions for airline operators to compose maintenance programmes for Flying Crane aircrafts, including maintenance tasks and intervals for the selected airframe systems and structural components; and (5) To identify applicable maintenance organisations in China for Flying Crane aircrafts in accordance with both European and Chinese airworthiness requirements.

40|$|All {{civil and}} private {{aircraft}} {{are required to}} comply with the airworthiness standards set by their national airworthiness authority and throughout their operational life must be in a condition of safe operation. Aviation accident data shows that over 20 % of all fatal accidents in aviation are due to airworthiness issues, specifically aircraft mechanical failures. Ultimately {{it is the responsibility of}} each registered operator to ensure that their aircraft remain in a condition of safe operation, and this is done through both effective <b>management</b> of <b>airworthiness</b> activities and the effective programme governance of safety outcomes. Typically, the projects within these <b>airworthiness</b> <b>management</b> programmes are focused on acquiring, modifying and maintaining the aircraft as a capability supporting the business. Programme governance provides the structure through which the goals and objectives of airworthiness programmes are set along with the means of attaining them. Whilst the principal causes of failures in many programmes can be traced to inadequate programme governance, many of the failures in large-scale projects can have their root causes in the organizational culture and more specifically in the organizational processes related to decision-making. This paper examines the primary theme of project and programme-based enterprises, and introduces a model for measuring organizational culture in <b>airworthiness</b> <b>management</b> programmes using measures drawn from 211 respondents in Australian airline programmes. The paper describes the theoretical perspectives applied to modifying an original model to specifically focus it on measuring the organizational culture of programmes for managing airworthiness; identifying the most important factors needed to explain the relationship between the measures collected, and providing a description of the nature of these factors.

40|$|Activities {{in civil}} {{aviation}} organizations {{are affected by}} the growing number of requirements both from organizations’ customers as well as from regulatory authorities. The organizations are therefore encouraged to introduce and maintain an effective management system that will ensure achieving of desired objectives. In the area of <b>continuing</b> <b>airworthiness</b> there is a traditional approach to management represented by developing and maintaining organisation exposition, which is organised in accordance with guidelines provided by regulatory authorities. The expositions are therefore focused mostly on describing duties and responsibilities of organization’s departments instead of identifying processes from their inputs to outputs.
