Systemic deletion of the gene encoding adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of triglyceride lipolysis, results in a phenotype characterized by severe steatotic cardiac dysfunction. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate a potential role of {{oxidative stress}} in <b>cardiac</b> ATGL <b>deficiency.</b> Hearts of mice with global ATGL knockout were compared to those of mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted overexpression of ATGL and to those of wildtype littermates. Our results demonstrate that oxidative stress, measured as lucigenin chemiluminescence, was increased ~ 6 -fold in ATGL-deficient hearts. In parallel, cytosolic NADPH oxidase subunits p 67 phox and p 47 phox were upregulated 4 – 5 -fold at the protein level. Moreover, a prominent upregulation of different inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor α, monocyte chemotactant protein- 1, interleukin 6, and galectin- 3) was observed in those hearts. Both the oxidative and inflammatory responses were abolished upon cardiomyocyte-restricted overexpression of ATGL. Investigating the effect of oxidative and inflammatory stress on nitric oxide/cGMP signal transduction we observed a ~ 2. 5 -fold upregulation of soluble guanylate cyclase activity and a ~ 2 -fold increase in cardiac tetrahydrobiopterin levels. Systemic treatment of ATGL-deficient mice with the superoxide dismutase mimetic Mn(III) tetrakis (4 -benzoic acid) porphyrin did not ameliorate but rather aggravated cardiac oxidative stress. Our data suggest that oxidative and inflammatory stress seems involved in lipotoxic heart disease.

40|$|Iron is an {{essential}} nutrient involved in numerous cellular functions and tightly regulated within cells. It is extremely important to maintain both systemic and intracellular iron homeostasis by orchestrating iron uptake, storage, utilization and export. Many human diseases are associated with disruption of iron homeostasis. Both iron overload and iron deficiency {{have been associated with}} cardiomyopathy and heart failure, but the molecular details of cardiac iron utilization are incompletely understood. Although it was known that transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr 1) is responsible for iron uptake in erythroid precursors, its role in other tissues, and other possible roles, have not been studied in detail. We hypothesized that Tfr 1 might play a role in cardiac iron uptake and used gene targeting to examine the role of Tfr 1 in the heart in vivo. Tfr 1 was deleted specifically in cardiomyocytes, and loss of Tfr 1 caused iron deficiency in the heart. Surprisingly, we found that decreased iron was associated with severe cardiac metabolic consequences. Mice lacking Tfr 1 in the heart died in the second week of life, with cardiomegaly, poor cardiac function, failure of mitochondrial respiration and ineffective mitophagy. The phenotype could only be rescued by aggressive and ongoing iron therapy, but it was ameliorated by either a mutant Tfr 1 allele that does not bind transferrin or administration of nicotinamide riboside, an NAD precursor. In summary, our study found that Tfr 1 plays a primary role in uptake of Tf-bound iron in the heart, and yet may have other iron-independent functions in autophagy. Our results showed that iron is critical for the normal cellular metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and mitophagy in the heart. Our findings underscore the importance of both Tfr 1 and iron in the heart and provide mechanistic evidence for iron therapy in heart failure patients.

40|$|AbstractSystemic {{deletion}} of {{the gene}} encoding for adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in mice leads to severe cardiac dysfunction due to massive accumulation of neutral lipids in cardiomyocytes. Recently, impaired peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) signaling has been described to substantially contribute to the observed cardiac phenotype. Disturbances of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) have been implicated in numerous cardiac diseases including cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the potential role of UPS in <b>cardiac</b> ATGL <b>deficiency.</b> Our results demonstrate prominent accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in hearts of ATGL-deficient mice, an effect that was abolished upon cardiomyocyte-directed overexpression of ATGL. In parallel, cardiac protein expression of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E 1 a, which catalyzes the first step of the ubiquitination cascade, was significantly upregulated in ATGL-deficient hearts. Dysfunction of the UPS was accompanied by activation of NF-κB signaling. Moreover, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -resident chaperon protein disulfide isomerase was significantly upregulated in ATGL-deficient hearts. Chronic treatment of ATGL-deficient mice with the PPARα agonist Wy 14, 643 improved proteasomal function, prevented NF-κB activation and decreased oxidative stress.

The cardioprotective property of theangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is primarily mediated via a kinin-releasingpathway, which may cause regression of the left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensivesituations. The ability of kallikrein gene delivery to produce a wide spectrum of beneficialeffects makes it a promising candidate in treating hypertension and cardiovascular andrenal diseases.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the activities of}} respiratory chain complexes and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity of the heart to gain insights into the pathological significance of mitochondrial dysfunction in chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCM). In a murine model of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, biochemical and histochemical analysis of the <b>cardiac</b> mitochondria revealed <b>deficiency</b> of the respiratory chain complexes (CI–CV) in infected mice; the inhibition of CI activity was more pronounced in the acute infection phase, CIII was constitutively repressed throughout the infection and disease phase, and the CV defects appeared in chronic phase only. A substantial decline in cardiac mtDNA content (54 – 60 %) and mitochondria-encoded transcripts (50 – 65 %) with disease development indicated that the alterations in mtDNA contribute to the quantitative deficiencies in respiratory chain activity in chagasic hearts. The observations of a selective inhibition of redox-sensitive CI and CIII complexes that are also the site of free radical generation in mitochondria, and the decline in cardiac mtDNA content in infected mice, all support the free radical hypothesis of mitochondria dysfunction in CCM. Consequently, OXPHOS-mediated ATP synthesis capacity of the cardiac mitochondria in infected mice was substantially reduced (37 – 50 %), suggesting an energy homeostasis in the affected tissue...|$|R

This scale evaluates measurable clinical features of PGM 1 -CDG. We {{examined the relationship between}} genotype, enzyme activity, and TPCRS score by using regression analysis.

Cardiac Progenitor Cells (CPCs) {{have been shown to}} be a potential cellular therapeutic approach to blunt tissue damage and facilitate reparative and regenerative processes after myocardial infarction (MI). Cardiac progenitor cells are important for maintenance of myocardial structure and function, but molecular mechanisms governing CPCs remain obscure and require elucidation to enhance regenerative therapeutic approaches. Normal CPCs engineered with fluorescent reporter protein constructs under control of the [alpha]MHC promoter show transgene protein expression, confirming activity of the promoter in CPCs. Cultured CPCs from both non-transgenic and cardiac-specific transgenic mice expressing survival kinases driven by the [alpha]MHC promoter were analyzed to characterize transgene expression following treatments to promote differentiation in culture. Green fluorescent protein under regulatory control of the endogenous Sca- 1 promoter is present in vascular structures in mature mice. However, lack of Sca- 1 does not result in a primary vascular defect. Instead, genetic deletion of Sca- 1 results in early-onset <b>cardiac</b> contractile <b>deficiency</b> as determined by echocardiography and hemodynamics. ScaKI mice show compromised capacity to survive myocardial infarction relative to normal control subjects. Resident cardiac progenitor cells in ScaKI mice do not respond to pathological damage in vivo, consistent with observations of impaired growth and survival of ScaKI cardiac progenitor cells in vitro. Genetic deletion of Sca - 1 causes primary cardiac defects in myocardial contractility and repair. These defects are likely due to impairment of resident cardiac progenitor cell proliferative capacity, possibly through altered Lef 1 transcription factor expression. Thus, disruption of cardiac progenitor cells results in a heart that is slightly impaired in normal function with greatly reduced capacity to repair itself after injury. CPCs have also been shown to respond to aging or general cardiomyopathy as damage. CPCs can be isolated and cultured from middle- aged hearts but they exhibit slightly impaired growth kinetics. The CPCs used for autologous cardiac progenitor cell therapy purposes would most likely benefit more from genetic engineering to increase proliferation and survival but they are still capable of supporting cardiac function in the context of aging and diseas...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—An R 120 G {{mutation}} in B-crystallin (CryABR 120 G) causes desmin-related myopathy (DRM). In mice with cardiomyocyte-specific {{expression of the}} mutation, CryABR 120 G-mediated DRM is characterized by CryAB and desmin accumulations within <b>cardiac</b> muscle, mitochondrial <b>deficiencies,</b> activation of apoptosis, and heart failure (HF). Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is often a hallmark of HF and treatment with antioxidants can sometimes prevent the progression of HF in terms of contractile dysfunction and cardiomyocyte survival. It is unknown whether blockade of ROS is beneficial for protein misfolding diseases such as DRM. We addressed this question by blocking the activity of xanthine oxidase (XO), a superoxide-generating enzyme that is upregulated in our model of DRM. The XO inhibitor oxypurinol was administered to CryABR 120 G mice {{for a period of}} 1 or 3 months. Mitochondrial function was dramatically improved in treated animals in terms of complex I activity and conservation of mitochondrial membrane potential. Oxypurinol also largely restored normal mitochondrial morphology. Surprisingly, however, cardiac contractile function and cardiac compliance were unimproved, indicating that the contractile deficit might be independent of mitochondrial dysfunction and the initiation of apoptosis. Using magnetic bead microrheology at the single cardiomyocyte level, we demonstrated that sarcomeric disarray and accumulation of the physical aggregates resulted in significant changes in the cytoskeletal mechanical properties in the CryABR 120 G cardiomyocytes. Our findings indicate that oxypurinol treatment largely prevented mitochondrial deficiency in DRM but that contractility wa...|$|R
40|$|Classic Timothy {{syndrome}} (TS) {{is a rare}} congenital arrhythmia disorder with dysfunction {{in multiple}} organ systems, clinically characterized by long QT syndrome and syndactyly. These unique features may be accompanied by congenital <b>cardiac</b> defects, immune <b>deficiency</b> and autism [12]. The first cases of TS were described in 1992 and 1995 as sporadic cases of long QT syndrome, congenital heart disease and syndactyly [4 – 6]. To date, only 25 cases of classic TS {{have been reported in}} the literature [11]. Classic TS is caused by a single missense mutation G 406 R of exon 8 A of the Ca v 1. 2 L-type calcium channel gene (CAC-NA 1 C) and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, although it usually is the result of a de novo mutation [11, 12]. This gain-of-function mutation results in an impaired open-state voltage-dependent inactivation of the L-type calcium channel, ultimately leading to a markedly prolonged myocardial action potential [12, 13]. A rare variant of TS with only two reported cases in the literature so far is caused by two different point mutations of exon 8 of the CACNA 1 C gene (G 406 R or G 402 S) and is clinically characterized by long QT syndrome in the absence of syndactyly [10]. As a result of prolonged QT-interval, patients with TS are prone to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias [10 – 12]. Besides cardiac arrhythmias, manifestations of TS include congenital heart defects lik...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: Research into right {{ventricular}} (RV) {{physiology and}} identification of pathomechanisms underlying RV failure have been neglected {{for many years}} because function of the RV is often considered to be less important for overall hemodynamics and maintenance of blood circulation. In view of this, the present study focuses on identifying specific adaptive mechanisms of {{the right and left}} ventricle (LV) during a state of chronic nitric oxide (NO) deficiency, one of the main causes of <b>cardiac</b> failure. NO <b>deficiency</b> was induced in rats by L-NAME feeding over a four weeks period. The cardiac remodeling was then characterized separately for the RV/LV using qRT-PCR, histology, and functional measurements. RESULTS: Only the RV underwent remodeling that corresponded morphologically and functionally with the pattern of dilated cardiomyopathy. Symptoms in the LV were subtle and consisted primarily of moderate hypertrophy. A massive increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) (+ 4. 5 +/- 0. 8 fold, vs. control) and a higher degree of oxidized tropomyosin (+ 46 +/- 4 % vs. control) and peroxynitrite (+ 32 +/- 2 % vs. control) could be identified as the cause of both RV fibrosis and contractile dysfunction. The expression of superoxide dismutase- 2 was specifically increased in the LV by 51 +/- 3 % and prevented the ROS increase and the corresponding structural and functional remodeling. INNOVATION: This study identified the inability of the RV to increase its antioxidant capacity as an important risk factor for developing RV failure. CONCLUSION: Unlike the LV, the RV did not display the necessary adaptive mechanisms to cope with increased oxidative stress during a state of chronic NO deficiency...|$|R

Methods and resultsHearts of knockout mice and their wild-type controls were collected for histochemistry or perfused according to Langendorff, and kidneys were removed to measure tissue Ang II. Ang II dose-dependently decreased coronary flow (CF) and left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), and these effects were absent in all genotypes deficient for AT 1 a, independently of AT 1 band AT 2. The deletion of Ang II receptors had an effect neither on the morphology of medium-sized vessels in the heart nor on the development of fibrosis. However, the lack of both AT 1 subtypes was associated with atrophic changes in the myocardium, a reduced CF and a reduced LVSP. AT 1 adeletion alone, independently of {{the presence or absence of}} AT 1 band/or AT 2, reduced renal Ang II by 50 despite a five-fold rise of plasma Ang II. AT 1 bdeletion, on top of AT 1 adeletion (but not alone), further decreased tissue Ang II, while increasing plasma Ang II. In mice deficient for all three Ang II receptors, renal Ang II was located only extracellularly. Conclusion The lack of both AT 1 subtypes led to a baseline reduction of CF and LVSP, and the effects of Ang II on CF and LVSP were found to be exclusively mediated via AT 1 a. The lack of AT 1 aor AT 1 bdoes not influence the development or maintenance of normal <b>cardiac</b> morphology, whereas <b>deficiency</b> for both receptors led to atrophic changes in the heart.

40|$|There is {{an intense}} {{interest}} in differentiating {{embryonic stem cells}} to engineer biological pacemakers {{as an alternative to}} electronic pacemakers for patients with <b>cardiac</b> pacemaker function <b>deficiency.</b> Embryonic stem cell-derived cardiocytes (ESCs), however, often exhibit dysrhythmic excitations. Using Ca 2 + imaging and patch-clamp techniques, we studied requirements for generation of spontaneous rhythmic action potentials (APs) in late-stage mouse ESCs. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of ESCs generates spontaneous, rhythmic, wavelet-like Local Ca 2 + Releases (LCRs) (inhibited by ryanodine, tetracaine, or thapsigargin). L-type Ca 2 +current (I CaL) induces a global Ca 2 + release (CICR), depleting the Ca 2 + content SR which resets the phases of LCR oscillators. Following a delay, SR then generates a highly synchronized spontaneous Ca 2 +release of multiple LCRs throughout the cell. The LCRs generate an inward Na +/Ca 2 +exchanger (NCX) current (absent in Na +-free solution) that ignites the next AP. Interfering with SR Ca 2 + cycling (ryanodine, caffeine, thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid, BAPTA-AM), NCX (Na +-free solution), or I CaL (nifedipine) results in dysrhythmic excitations or cessation of automaticity. Inhibition of cAMP/PKA signaling by a specific PKA inhibitor, PKI, decreases SR Ca 2 + loading, substantially reducing both spontaneous LCRs (number, size, and amplitude) and rhythmic AP firing. In contrast, enhancing PKA signaling by cAMP increases the LCRs (number, size, duration) and converts irregularly beating ESCs to rhythmic "pacemaker-like" cells. SR Ca 2 + loading and LCR activity could be also increased with a selective activation of SR Ca 2 + pumping by a phospholamban antibody. We conclude that SR Ca 2 + loading and spontaneous rhythmic LCRs are driven by inherent cAMP/PKA activity. I CaL synchronizes multiple LCR oscillators resulting in strong, partially synchronized diastolic Ca 2 + release and NCX current. Rhythmic ESC automaticity can be achieved by boosting "coupling" factors, such as cAMP/PKA signaling, that enhance interactions between SR and sarcolemma. © 2010. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar as freqüências cardíaca e respiratória, a pressão {{arterial}} média, a temperatura e a saturação periférica de oxigênio dos recém-nascidos pré-termo (RNPT) de baixo peso, antes e após a aplicação do MMC. MÉTODOS: Foram avaliados 22 RNPT de baixo peso, saudáveis, de ambos os sexos, não portadores de deficiências neurológicas, cardíacas e/ou respiratórias. A avaliação foi realizada após trinta minutos de permanência do RNPT em berço comum e após trinta minutos de aplicação do MMC, por 3 dias consecutivos. Para a avaliação, foram utilizados monitor cardíaco com dispositivo para medida da pressão arterial média de forma não invasiva e sensor para a oximetria de pulso, termômetro e cronômetro. RESULTADOS: Os resultados não mostraram alterações significativas quanto à pressão arterial média (p> 0, 05) e freqüência cardíaca (p> 0, 05) após a aplicação do MMC, mas, por outro lado, houve aumento significativo da temperatura axilar (p OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the heart and respiration rates, mean arterial pressure, temperature and peripheral oxygen saturation of low-weight preterm newborns, before and after the application of kangaroo mother care. METHOD: Twenty-two healthy low-weight preterm newborns of both sexes were studied. None of them had neurological, <b>cardiac</b> and/or respiratory <b>deficiencies.</b> Assessments were made after the newborn had been left in an ordinary cot for 30 minutes and after 30 minutes of kangaroo mother care, on three consecutive days. For these evaluations, a heart monitor with a device for non-invasively measuring mean arterial pressure, a sensor for pulse oximetry, a thermometer and a chronometer were utilized. RESULTS: There were no significant changes in mean arterial pressure (p> 0. 05) or heart rate (p> 0. 05) after applying kangaroo mother care. However, there were significant increases in axillary temperature (p< 0. 05) and peripheral oxygen saturation (p< 0. 05), and a significant decrease in respiration rate (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Kangaroo mother care promotes improvement in body temperature, increased peripheral oxygen saturation (thus improving tissue oxygenation), and decreased respiration rate (thus providing greater respiratory comfort for the newborns). This suggests that kangaroo mother care contributes towards beneficial alterations in the low-weight newborns' vital signs...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Pompe disease (PD) {{is a rare}} {{metabolic}} myopathy {{characterized by}} loss of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), the enzyme responsible for breaking down glycogen to glucose within the lysosomes. PD cells accumulate massive quantities of glycogen within their lysosomes, and as such, PD is classified as a “lysosomal storage disease” (LSD). GAA-deficient cells also exhibit accumulation of autophagic debris. Symptoms of severe infantile PD include extreme muscle weakness, hypotonia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, resulting in death before one year of age. Certain LSDs are currently being successfully treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which involves intravenous infusion of a recombinant enzyme to counteract the endogenous deficiency. ERT has been less successful in PD, however, due to ineffective delivery of the recombinant enzyme. Alternatively, specific genes deletion may reduce lysosomal glycogen load, and could thus be targeted in PD therapy development. Absence of malin (EPM 2 B) or laforin (EPM 2 A) has been proposed to impair autophagy, which could reduce lysosomal glycogen levels. Additionally, deficiency of Stbd 1 has been postulated to disable lysosomal glycogen import. Furthermore, Ptg deficiency was previously reported to abrogate Lafora body formation and correct neurological abnormalities in Lafora disease mouse models and could have similar effects on PD pathologies. The goal {{of this study was}} to characterize the effects of homozygous disruption of Epm 2 a, Epm 2 b, Stbd 1, and Ptg loci on total glycogen levels in PD mouse model heart tissue, as in severe infantile PD, it is accumulation of glycogen in the heart that results in fatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Gaa-/- mice were intercrossed with Epm 2 a-/-, Epm 2 b-/-, Stbd 1 -/-, and Ptg-/- mice to generate wildtype (WT), single knockout, and double knockout mice. The results indicated that Gaa-/- hearts accumulated up to 100 -fold more glycogen than the WT. These mice also displayed <b>cardiac</b> hypertrophy. However, <b>deficiency</b> of Epm 2 a, Epm 2 b, Stbd 1, or PTG in the Gaa-/- background did not reveal changes of statistical significance in either heart glycogen or cardiac hypertrophy. Nevertheless, since total glycogen was measured, these deficiencies should not be discarded in future discussions of PD therapy, as increasing sample sizes and/or distinguishing cytosolic from lysosomal glycogen content may yet reveal differences of greater significance...|$|R
40|$|Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is the {{radiographic}} {{evaluation of}} the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes after the administration of a radio-opaque medium through the cervical canal. The first HSG was performed in 1910 and {{was considered to be}} the first special radio¬logic procedure. A properly performed HSG can de¬tect the contour of the uterine cavity and the width of the cervical canal. Further contrast medium injection will outline the cornua isthmic and ampullary portions of the tubes, and will show the degree of spillage. If a properly performed HSG shows no uterine cavity abnormality, it is very unlikely that other modalities would do so. Although this procedure is considered diagnostic, there may also be a possible therapeutic benefit from the flushing effect. Indications and Contraindications HSG is used predominantly in the evaluation of in-fertility. Despite the arrival of newer imaging modalities, HSG still remains the best procedure to image the fallopi¬an tubes. Although evaluating feminine infertility, with or without the presence of repeated miscarriages, is the main indication for this method, it can also be used in other cas-es, such as pain in the pelvis tract, congenital or anatomic abnormalities, anomalies of the menstrual cycle, and ab-normal menses. Also, it is sometimes used as a preoper-ative control for women who are about to have uterine or tubal surgery. Soares and coworkers showed that HSG had a sensitivity of 58 % and a positive-predictive value of 28. 6 % for polypoid lesions, and a sensitivity of 0 % for endometrial hyperplasia. The same study showed HSG to have a sensitivity of 44. 4 % for uterine malformations, and a sensitivity of 75 % for the detection of intrauterine adhesions. The main contraindication of the examination is possible pregnancy. This contraindication can be avoid¬ed by performing the examination before the ovulation phase, between the 7 th to 10 th day of the menstrual cycle. Because of the scattering risk, the examination should be avoided when there is active intrapelvic inflammation. Another contraindication is vaginal or uterine bleeding because of the risk of unrestrained bleeding, which could lead to transfusion or surgical recovery procedures. Fi¬nally, the examination should not be performed in cases of severe <b>cardiac</b> or renal <b>deficiency,</b> or in cases of recent uterine or tubal surgery. Technique Patient Preparation The procedure is performed {{in the first half of}} the menstrual cycle following cessation of bleeding. The endometrium is thin during this proliferative phase, which facilitates better image interpretation and should also ensure that there is no pregnancy. The patient is asked to refrain from unprotected sexual intercourse from the date of her period until after the investigation to be certain there is no risk of pregnancy. Examination in the second half of the cycle is avoided because the thickened secretory-phase endometrium increases the risk of venous intravasation and may cause a false-pos¬itive diagnosis of cornual occlusion. Antibiotics might be required 1 day before and for a few days after the examination if previous inflamma¬tions are present in the patient’s clinical history. Antibiotics are required after the examination when the maneuvers are fairly sanguineous or if the fallopian tubes present a certain degree of dilation. The suggest¬ed antibiotic regimen is metronidazole 1 g rectally at the time of the procedure, plus doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days. Steroid (prednisolone) premed¬ication is prescribed in asthmatics when intravenous contrast is used; there-fore, it is reasonable to do the same for HSG because intravasation is also possible from this procedure. Catheterization Technique For the catheterization technique, the patient is placed on the fluoroscopic machine in a gynecologic examination position. After cleaning the external gen¬ital area with antiseptic solution, the vagina is dilated by a gynecologic dilator. The cervix is localized and cleansed with iodine solution. Afterward, the uterine cervix is straightened by one (at the 12 o’clock posi¬tion) or two (at the 9 and 3 o’clock positions) surgi¬cal forceps exercising a degree of pulling. Next, the outside uterine cervix ostium is catheterized. The catheterization can be performed in two ways. In the authors’ country, a salpinographer with a bell-shaped end (diameter depends on the case) is pushed through the vagina and fits in the external uterine cervix osti¬um. In the second technique, the salpingographer has a plastic cup-shaped end that is fitted to the external uterine cervix ostium, creating a void phenomenon. In both techniques, there is a syringe with iodinated hydrosoluble contrast medium at the other end of the salpingographer. The vagina dilator is taken off after catheterization of the external uteri cervix ostium and before administration of the contrast medium. Contrast Media In the past, oil-soluble contrast media were mainly used. Today, we use all available iodinated hydrosol¬uble contrast media. According to international liter¬ature, the use of oil-soluble contrast media increases the pregnancy rate and contributes to a decrease in conception time after the salpingography is performed. However, Spring and coworkers found that there is no evidence that the choice of the contrast material affects the rate of term pregnancy. Moreover, they reported that oil-soluble contrast media may promote granulo¬matous inflammation in the presence of obstructed or inflamed fallopian tubes. Radiological Views One conventional radiograph of the pelvis (on a 24 ¬ 30 cm radiologic film) is necessary before the contrast medium is administrated into the uterine cavity so that possible intrapyelic masses or calcifications will not complicate interpretation of the images. A metallic marker is placed over one side of the pelvis to indicate the right or left side of the patient. Next, the examina¬tion is performed under fluoroscopic control so that ra¬diographs can be taken during the filling of the uterine cavity (usually 2 - 3 cm of contrast medium is sufficient) and again during the filling of the fallopian tubes. Final¬ly, after the removal of the salpingographer, we radio¬graphically check the presence of contrast medium in the peritoneal cavity. The total amount of injected con¬trast medium should not exceed 10 mL. Additional spot radiographs are obtained to document any abnormality that is seen. Before the first radiograph, we also fluoro- scopically check the reflux of the contrast medium. Complications The two most common complications of HSG are pain and infection. These and other complications and side effects are summarized below. •	Uterine contractions and discomfort due to the introduction of contrast medium into the uterine cavi¬ty: The most common type of pain referenced is subab¬dominal colic caused by dilation of the uterine cavity. A more diffuse pain, caused by irritation of the peri¬toneum due to the contrast medium, has also been re¬ported. Pain can be minimized by slowly injecting the contrast medium and using isosmolar contrast agents. •	Postprocedural infection: Spreading and gener-alization of intrapyelic inflammation may happen in cases of chronic inflammation and hydrosalpinges, or after severe uterine injury caused by the examination maneuver. •	Vasovagal reaction: A possible reaction to ma-nipulation of the cervix or inflation of a conclusion balloon in the cervical canal. •	Traumatic elevation of endometrium by the in¬serted cannula: A complication which does not cause significant consequences. •	Uterine perforation and tubal rupture: These complications are very rare. •	Venous or lymphatic intravasation of contrast me-dia: With a water-based contrast medium there is no ad-verse effect on the patient, but it can make interpretation of the image difficult. It occurs more commonly in the presence of fibroids or tubal obstruction. Extravasation of the contrast medium could occur if the contrast me¬dium is administered too quickly, if the endometrium is injured during the catheterization, or if the examination is performed during menstruation. Extravasation is also possible when common or special inflammations of the endometrium are present due to the intercourse rate be-tween the uterine vein and the ovarian veins. •	Allergic reaction to contrast media: Such a reac¬tion is very uncommon with the use of the low-osmolar nonionic contrast agents currently available. •	Radiation exposure to the ovaries: Exposure is minimal and can be reduced if the proper technique is utilized. Normal Findings On face radiographs, the uterine cavity has a nor¬mal trigonal shape and the apex of the triangle corre¬sponds to the isthmus, which is nearly 3. 7 cm wide. The apex is pointed downwards and connected to the internal ostium of the cervix uteri, which is 2. 5 cm in total length. The base of triangular uterine cavity is the fundus, which can be concave, flattened, or slightly convex. On both sides of its base, in the area of the lateral horns, the two fallopian tubes are drowned. The fallopian tubes are separated into three segments: isth¬mus (attached to the uterus, not imaged in several cas¬es), ampullary (in the middle, the longest and widest segment), and bell-shaped (to the distal end). There are two ostiums: the internal or uterine, and the external or abdominal. From the abdominal ostium, the con¬trast medium disperses and diffuses into the peritone¬al cavity. Remaining contrast medium in the furrows of the peritoneum can be observed up to 3 hours after administration. Very often, the contrast medium in the rectouterine pouch of the peritoneum (Douglas’ space) can demonstrate the profile of the coordinate ovary. Congenital Uterus Anomalies Congenital uterus anomalies are caused by incom¬plete junction of the paramesonephric ducts (Muller ducts), or Extravasations of the contrast medium.
