5|$|The 'core' neuroacanthocytosis syndromes are chorea acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome. Acanthocytes {{are nearly}} always present in these {{conditions}} and they share common <b>clinical</b> <b>features.</b> Some of these features are also seen in the other neurological syndromes associated with neuroacanthocytosis.|$|E
5|$|The neuroacanthocytosis syndromes {{are caused}} by a range of genetic {{mutations}} and produce a variety of <b>clinical</b> <b>features</b> but primarily produce neurodegeneration of the brain, specifically the basal ganglia.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of endometrial cancers are carcinomas (usually adenocarcinomas), meaning that they originate from the single layer of epithelial cells that line the endometrium and form the endometrial glands. There are many microscopic subtypes of endometrial carcinoma, but they are broadly organized into two categories, Type I and Type II, based on <b>clinical</b> <b>features</b> and pathogenesis. The two subtypes are genetically distinct.|$|E

50|$|While {{the main}} {{classification}} in 1996 was the {{recovery from the}} attacks (this <b>clinical</b> <b>feature</b> separates RR from progressive), in the updated revision the main classification is the activity.|$|R
50|$|The {{hallmark}} <b>clinical</b> <b>feature</b> of polymyositis is proximal muscle weakness, {{with less}} important findings being muscle pain and dysphagia. Cardiac and pulmonary findings will {{be present in}} approximately 25% of cases of patients with polymyositis.|$|R
5|$|Syndromes {{in which}} causes are not clearly {{identified}} {{are difficult to}} match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy. Categorization for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily. The idiopathic (unknown cause) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general <b>clinical</b> <b>features</b> and/or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes {{are included in the}} unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic, for instance benign rolandic epilepsy. Others are included in symptomatic despite a presumed genetic cause (in at least in some cases), for instance Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature (e.g. Angelman syndrome) were categorized symptomatic but it was argued to include these within the category idiopathic. Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research.|$|E
5|$|The <b>clinical</b> <b>features</b> of latrodectism {{are similar}} for all species of Latrodectus spiders and is {{generally}} characterised by extreme pain. Initially, the bite may be painful, but sometimes only {{feels like a}} pin prick or mild burning sensation. Within an hour victims generally develop more severe local pain with local sweating and sometimes piloerection (goosebumps). Pain, swelling and redness spread proximally from the site. Less commonly, systemic envenoming is heralded by swollen or tender regional lymph nodes; associated features include malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, generalised sweating, headache, fever, hypertension and tremor. Rare complications include seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure or localised skin infection. The duration of effects can range from {{a few hours to}} days, with severe pain persisting for over 24 hours after being bitten in some cases.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1950s, the {{diagnosis}} of pituitary disease remained based on <b>clinical</b> <b>features</b> and visual field examination, sometimes aided by pneumoencephalography and X-ray tomography. Nevertheless, the field of pituitary surgery developed during this time. The major breakthrough in diagnosis came {{with the discovery of}} radioimmunoassay by Rosalyn Yalow and Solomon Berson in the late 1950s. This allowed the direct measurement of the hormones of the pituitary, which {{as a result of their}} low concentrations in blood had previously been hard to measure. Stimulation tests were developed in the 1960s, and in 1973 the triple bolus test was introduced, a test that combined stimulation testing with insulin, GnRH and TRH. Imaging of the pituitary, and therefore identification of tumors and other structural causes, improved radically with the introduction of computed tomography in the late 1970s and magnetic resonance imaging in the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|Osteogenesis Imperfecta is a {{heterogeneous}} genetical disorder and is inherited as an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive trait. The primary defect {{lies in the}} mutation of genes that encode type 1 collagen. Organs bearing connective tissue such as bone, sclera, inner ear, skin, ligaments, tendons, and fasciae are involved. With respect to clinical, biochemical and inheritance characteristics, this disorder is divided into 4 groups (OI I, OI II, OI III and OI IV). The <b>clinical</b> <b>feature</b> consists of mainly fragile bones with or without sclera and deafness. In report an 8 -year old boy is presented with a pedigree suggesting an autosomal recessive type of inheritance in whom with respect to <b>clinical</b> <b>feature,</b> Osteogenesis type IIB is diagnosed...|$|R
5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and routine analgesics. Hospital assessment is recommended if simple analgesia does not resolve local pain or <b>clinical</b> <b>features</b> of systemic envenoming occur. In more severe bites, Redback antivenom can be given. Redback antivenom can also cross-neutralise katipo venom, and it is used to treat envenoming from Latrodectus katipo in New Zealand. It is available from most major New Zealand hospitals. Antivenom will usually relieve symptoms of systemic envenoming and is indicated in anyone suffering symptoms consistent with Latrodectus envenoming. Unlike some other antivenoms, it is not limited to patients with signs of severe, systemic envenoming. Particular indications for using antivenom are local then generalised pain, sweating or hypertension. However, good evidence to support the effectiveness of widow spider antivenoms is lacking and studies have cast some doubt on antivenoms efficacy in latrodectism. Pain relief agents, such as parenteral opiates, or benzodiazepines may be required as adjunct agents.|$|E
25|$|The {{pediatric}} domains {{are classified}} first by age range {{and then by}} symptom pattern or area of symptom. Each domain contains several disorders, each with relatively specific <b>clinical</b> <b>features.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{almost all}} {{instances}} in which myoclonus is caused by central nervous system disease it is preceded by other symptoms; for instance, in CJD it is generally a late-stage <b>clinical</b> <b>feature</b> that appears after the patient has already started to exhibit gross neurological deficits.|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} or absence of ANCA cannot indicate {{presence or}} absence of disease and results are correlated with <b>clinical</b> <b>features.</b> The association of ANCA and disease activity remains controversial; however, the reappearance of ANCA after treatment can indicate a relapse.|$|E
25|$|The Baggio–Yoshinari {{syndrome}} (BYS), {{formerly known}} as the Brazilian Lyme-like disease and Brazilian human borreliosis, is a disease transmitted by the Amblyomma cajennense tick, but the organism that causes the infection is still unknown. <b>Clinical</b> <b>features</b> resemble those of Lyme disease (LD).|$|E
25|$|This {{leads to}} the <b>clinical</b> <b>features</b> of dRTA; In other words, the {{intercalated}} cells' apical H+/K+ antiporter is non-functional, resulting in proton retention and potassium excretion. Since calcium phosphate stones demonstrate a proclivity for deposition at higher pHs (alkaline), {{the substance of the}} kidney develops stones bilaterally; this does not occur in the other RTA types.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor, is an immunomodulating and {{anti-inflammatory}} {{drug that}} inhibits T-cell activation {{and production of}} cytokines. The elevated level of cytokines in morphea causes fibroblast proliferation and subsequent overproduction of collagen. Theoretically, tacrolimus could inhibit the pathophysiologic process of morphea. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether tacrolimus 0. 1 % ointment is an effective treatment for active plaque morphea in a double-blind, placebo (petroleum emollient) -controlled pilot study. METHODS: Ten patients with active plaque morphea were included. All patients were treated with tacrolimus 0. 1 % ointment and with an emollient (petrolatum) on two selected morphea plaques, applied twice daily for 12 weeks. Initial and final assessment included surface area measurements, photography, durometer scores, and <b>clinical</b> <b>feature</b> scores. Adverse reactions were recorded. RESULTS: The scleroderma plaques treated with topical tacrolimus 0. 1 % improved, resulting in {{a significant reduction in}} durometer and <b>clinical</b> <b>feature</b> scores. Overall, a significant difference could be found between topical tacrolimus and petrolatum with regard to durometer score (p < 0. 005) and the <b>clinical</b> <b>feature</b> score (p = 0. 019). CONCLUSION: In this first double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study comparing tacrolimus 0. 1 % ointment with petrolatum in active plaque morphea, tacrolimus 0. 1 % ointment was shown to be an effective treatment for this condition...|$|R

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of A-T is usually suspected by {{the combination of}} neurologic <b>clinical</b> <b>features</b> (ataxia, abnormal control of eye movement, and postural instability) with telangiectasia and sometimes increased infections, and confirmed by specific laboratory abnormalities (elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels, increased chromosomal breakage or cell death of white blood cells after exposure to X-rays, absence of ATM protein in white blood cells, or mutations {{in each of the}} person’s ATM genes).|$|E
25|$|Differentiation {{of these}} {{disorders}} is often possible with <b>clinical</b> <b>features</b> and selected laboratory tests. In {{cases where the}} distinction is unclear, clinical laboratories can identify genetic abnormalities of ATM, aprataxin and senataxin, and specialty centers can identify abnormality of the proteins of potentially responsible genes, such as ATM, MRE11, nibrin, TDP1, aprataxin and senataxin {{as well as other}} proteins important to ATM function such as ATR, DNA-PK, and RAD50.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} and distinctive <b>clinical</b> <b>features</b> of the disease is hypersensitivity to neuroleptic and antiemetic medications that affect dopaminergic and cholinergic systems. In the worst cases, a patient treated with these medications could become catatonic, lose cognitive function, or develop life-threatening muscle rigidity.
