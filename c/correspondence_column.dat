If the schoolmaster at large is grey and dull, shirking interesting topics and emphatic speech, what must he be like in the monotonous class-room? These may seem wanton charges to some, but I am not speaking without my book. Monthly I am brought into close contact with the pedagogic intelligence through the medium of three educational magazines. A certain morbid habit against which I struggle in vain makes me read everything I catch a schoolmaster writing. I am, indeed, one of the faithful band who read the Educational Supplement of the Times. In these papers schoolmasters write about their business, lectures upon the questions of their calling are reported at length, and a sort of invalid discussion moves with painful decorum through the <b>correspondence</b> <b>column.</b> The scholastic mind so displayed in action fascinates me. It is like watching a game of billiards with wooden cushes and beechwood balls.|$|E
60|$|Some years ago, when I was the Editor of a <b>Correspondence</b> <b>Column,</b> I used {{to receive}} heart-broken letters from young men asking for advice and sympathy. They found {{themselves}} {{the object of}} marked attentions from girls which they scarcely knew how to deal with. They {{did not wish to}} give pain or to seem indifferent to a love which they felt was as ardent as it was disinterested, and yet they felt that they could not bestow their hands where their hearts had not spoken. They wrote to me fully and frankly, and as one soul might write to another for relief. I accepted their confidences as under the pledge of a secrecy, never divulging their disclosures beyond the circulation of my newspapers, or giving any hint of their identity other than printing their names and addresses and their letters in full. But I may perhaps without dishonour reproduce one of these letters, and my answer to it, inasmuch as the date is now months ago, and the softening hand of Time has woven its roses--how shall I put it?--the mellow haze of reminiscences has--what I mean is that the young man has gone back to work and is all right again.|$|E

It is a farcical comedy about the suffragettes' {{campaign}} for votes {{for women in}} Britain. The play is a departure from Shaw's earlier Ibsenesque dramas on social issues. Shaw's own pro-feminist views are never articulated by characters in the play, but instead it ridicules the arguments of the anti-suffrage campaigners.|$|R

It {{is one of}} the most successful among the penny weeklies, and in addition to its sensational stories and moral essays, it gives advice gratis to all and sundry in its correspondence columns upon every conceivable subject that our common peccant or ignorant humanity can possibly inquire about. Now, Harry Pallant happened to be the particular person employed by the editor of this omniscient journal to supply the answers to the weekly shoals of anxious interrogators de omni scibili. His legal learning came in handy for the purpose, and being a practised London journalist as well, his knowledge of life stood him in good stead at this strange piece of literary craftsmanship. But the whole affair was [...] "in strict confidence," [...] as the Monitor announced. It was a point of honour between himself and the editor that the secret of the <b>correspondence</b> <b>column</b> should be jealously guarded from all and several; so Harry Pallant, accustomed, lawyer-like, to keeping secrets, had never mentioned his connection with the Monitor in this matter even to Louie. It came as part of his week's work at his chambers in the Temple, and it was duly finished and sent off to press, without note or comment, on the same day, in true business-like barrister fashion.|$|E

50|$|Psychosis: Psychological, Social and Integrative Approaches is a triannual peer-reviewed {{medical journal}} {{published}} by Routledge {{on behalf of}} the International Society for the Psychological Treatments of the Schizophrenias and other Psychoses. The main scope of the journal is research focused on the psychological treatments of psychosis (e.g. cognitive-behavior therapy, psychodynamic therapy, family therapy etc.) and the psycho-social causes of psychosis (e.g. poverty, drug abuse, child abuse and neglect, distressed families, urban living, discrimination, rape, war combat etc.). It contains original research, systematic reviews, commentaries on contentious articles, short reports, first-persons accounts, a book review section, and a <b>correspondence</b> <b>column</b> relating to the areas of psychiatry and psychology. The journal publishes papers on both quantitative research (e.g. rigorously designed outcome studies and epidemiological surveys) and qualitative research (e.g. case studies of therapy, first-person accounts of psychosis and experiences of people with psychosis in the mental health system), as well as papers focusing on conceptual and ethical issues.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{see whether}} some {{sections}} of the BMJ attract more comment than others, whether letters submitted in response to different {{sections of the}} journal are rejected at different rates, and whether the balance between letters that agree and disagree with articles in the published correspondence reflects that in submitted letters. DESIGN [...] Retrospective audit of letters submitted for publication in the correspondence columns of the BMJ in response to articles published between 1 January and 21 May 1989. SUBJECTS [...] A total of 1319 letters received by the journal, 974 submitted {{in response to the}} 1501 published articles and a further 345 raising new issues. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] The total numbers of letters submitted in response to the four main sections of the journal [...] editorials, news, papers, and middles [...] and the numbers published. Submitted and published letters were analysed according to whether they agreed or disagreed with articles. RESULTS [...] The overall rejection rate was 63 % (831 / 1319), but among letters relating to articles it was 56 % (543 / 974). Editorials and middles attracted proportionately more letters than papers, but letters relating to papers had a lower rejection rate (43 % v 57 % for editorials and 43 % v 66 % for middles). For all sections more letters disagreed than agreed, but a higher proportion of letters in response to editorials and middles disagreed than those submitted in response to papers (64 % and 72 % v 53 %). Among the published letters, however, broadly equal numbers of letters agreed and disagreed with articles, irrespective of section. CONCLUSION [...] Those sections of the journal that aim at stimulating debate succeeded in attracting the most comment. The relative importance of original scientific research papers was reflected by the priority given to letters submitted in response to papers, and the final <b>correspondence</b> <b>column</b> was a balanced platform of debate despite an unequal submitted response in terms of letters that agreed and disagreed with different sections of the journal...|$|E
40|$|As {{the editor}} of The Idler (1892 - 1898) and To-day (1893 - 1898) Jerome K. Jerome posed as both ‘idler’ and social commentator, {{alternately}} providing his readership with comfortably masculine humour and informed debate on topical issues. The monthly Idlers’ Club affirmed conservative values relieved by scathing irony on such topics as the New Woman and the questionable practices of literary reviewing. But as Anne Humpherys astutely observes, ‘Jerome’s Idler is implicitly positioned against a life of “working”’, for whom the shared humour of the club provides transient relief from labour. As he assured Theodore Watts-Dunton in October 1892, ‘I knew you had an idea that we were rather frivolous on the “Idler” … we are striking a more serious note which will continue to sound louder through succeeding numbers. ’ The focus of the weekly To-day is consciously London-centric. Like The Idler, it is implicitly {{based on the principle}} of a club, to which the readers gain membership (and from which they can even be expelled). Editorial control is exercised most obviously through the weekly editorials, but equally important was the <b>correspondence</b> <b>column</b> which became a key feature of To-Day. Jerome’s growing sense of the journal as a ‘club’ is most obvious in the title of this section, which begins as ‘Answers to Enquirers’ but becomes the more reciprocal ‘Correspondence’ after May 1895. In December 1896 he published a letter from a reader describing the journal as ‘our club’. In his last few months as editor he was developing a scheme to put lonely readers of the same sex in touch with each other, and grudgingly acknowledging the need for working London women to have clubs of their own. Male or female, many of Jerome’s readers would not have access {{to the world of the}} London club, but the editorial voice of the journal encourages them to see themselves as a community, assuming a shared knowledge of particular theatres and streets. In this formulation provincial and overseas readers metaphorically become ‘branch members’, emphasising both the influence of the journal and its global reach...|$|E

The idea of organizing domestic servants as workers was an anathema to many in both the labour and the women’s movements.

60|$|They met {{more often}} from that day, for Joan was frankly using her two columns in the Sunday Post to {{propagate}} his aims. Carleton, to her surprise, made no objection. Nor did he seek {{to learn the}} result of his ultimatum. It looked, they thought, as if he had assumed acceptance; and was willing for Phillips to choose his own occasion. Meanwhile replies to her articles reached Joan in weekly increasing numbers. There seemed to be a wind arising, blowing towards Protection. Farm labourers, especially, appeared to be enthusiastic for its coming. From their ill- spelt, smeared epistles, one gathered that, after years of doubt and hesitation, they had--however reluctantly--arrived at the conclusion that without it there could be no hope for them. Factory workers, miners, engineers--more fluent, less apologetic--wrote as strong supporters of Phillips's scheme; but saw clearly how upon Protection its success depended. Shopmen, clerks--only occasionally ungrammatical--felt sure that Robert Phillips, the tried friend of the poor, would insist upon the boon of Protection being no longer held back from the people. Wives and mothers claimed it as their children's birthright. Similar views got themselves at the same time, into the <b>correspondence</b> <b>columns</b> of Carleton's other numerous papers.
