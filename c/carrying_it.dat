5|$|According to Jesús Pastor Paloma, an Agustinian Recollect priest, the {{structure}} was also {{supposed to have}} a prefabricated retablo (reredos) altar, which was lost at sea when the ship <b>carrying</b> <b>it</b> from Belgium capsized in a storm; a wooden altar was made locally in its stead. Paloma also noted that the bottom part of the church was designed to resemble a ship's hull, so that it would sway during an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Also {{benefiting from}} the {{offensive}} line's strength was Tech quarterback Bryan Randall. Randall finished the regular season with 1,957passing yards and 12passing touchdowns, completing 140 of his 225passes during the process. He also was successful running the ball, <b>carrying</b> <b>it</b> for 527yards and three touchdowns during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear import {{depends on}} the importin binding its cargo in the {{cytoplasm}} and <b>carrying</b> <b>it</b> through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.|$|E

5|$|The plan {{to set up}} a {{shantytown}} in Washington, D.C., {{was carried}} out soon after the April 4 assassination. Criticism of King's plan was subdued {{in the wake of his}} death, and the SCLC received an unprecedented wave of donations for the purpose of <b>carrying</b> <b>it</b> out. The campaign officially began in Memphis, on May 2, at the hotel where King was murdered.|$|E
5|$|According to an anecdote, {{the idea}} arose after {{a group of}} Royal Navy {{officers}} saw a similar, but fictional, bomb depicted in the 1943 Walt Disney animated propaganda film Victory Through Air Power, and the name Disney was consequently given to the weapon. The Royal Navy developed the bomb even though the Fleet Air Arm operated no aircraft capable of <b>carrying</b> <b>it.</b> The navy was interested in a concrete-penetrating weapon due to the German navy's extensive use of fortified submarine pens to protect their U-boats and E-boats from air attack while docked.|$|E
5|$|As Strike Back is a {{military}} drama, the production crew used a vast catalogue of firearms, including side arms, assault and sniper rifles, as well as rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and other explosives. Cast members were first taught by carrying weights that mimicked {{the weight of the}} weapons so they could get used to <b>carrying</b> <b>it</b> during filming. Later, they were taught how to carry them professionally, including how to disassemble and re-assemble them, as well as how to fire and reload. Though the majority were actually rubber, duplicates were sometimes used for some of the background characters. Three ex-SAS soldiers gave the cast weapons and tactical training, and were also on hand to oversee how cast members carried the weapons during filming sessions.|$|E
50|$|Until 1993, many area {{cable systems}} {{chose not to}} <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> {{due to a lack}} of {{compelling}} programming, poor signal quality or inadequate viewership—most notably Marcus Cable (now part of Charter Communications), the largest cable provider in Milwaukee's outer suburbs. On the systems that did <b>carry</b> <b>it,</b> it was relegated to a lower-tier slot; it aired on channel 29 on Milwaukee's Time Warner Cable system, and on channel 48 in outlying areas.|$|R

5|$|Crickets are {{relatively}} defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are nocturnal {{and spend the}} day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in {{the cracks in the}} ground that develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the mandibles and then <b>carrying</b> <b>it</b> with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it with the head.|$|E
5|$|In July 1170, Becket and {{the king}} were {{reconciled}} {{and the king}} agreed that the archiepiscopal estates would be returned to Becket's control. But difficulties dragged on and Becket accused de Broc of stripping the estates of the recent harvest and storing {{it away from the}} archbishop's control. In November, John of Salisbury was sent by Becket to England to inspect the estates prior to Becket's return from exile. John claimed that although de Broc had originally returned custody of the estates to Becket's officials, shortly before John's arrival de Broc had regained control of the estates and expelled Becket's officials. De Broc was also accused of seizing a cargo of the archbishop's wine and destroying the ship <b>carrying</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 2015, a {{detailed}} {{article in the}} London Review of Books by journalist Seymour Hersh said that the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had kept bin Laden under house arrest at Abbottabad since 2006, and that Pakistani Army chief Pervez Kayani and ISI director Ahmad Shuja Pasha aided the U.S. mission to kill, not capture bin Laden. According to Hersh, Pakistani officials were always aware of bin Laden's location and were guarding the compound with their own soldiers. Pakistan decided to give up bin Laden's location to the U.S. because American aid was declining. Pakistani officials {{were aware of the}} raid, and assisted the U.S. in <b>carrying</b> <b>it</b> out. According to Hersh, bin Laden was basically an invalid.|$|E

These include Luke's home on Tatooine from A New Hope, the carbon-freezing chamber on Bespin from The Empire Strikes Back and the Emperor's throne {{room on the}} Death Star from Return of the Jedi. The capture the flag multiplayer mode has been altered since Dark Forces II. The player must now steal a ysalamir from the other team {{and return it to}} his or her own base.

5|$|While the Slaying of Goliath is a {{relatively}} simple composition with the two protagonists centrally placed and the only other figures being dimly seen observers, the Brazen Serpent picture is crowded with figures and separate incidents as the various individuals who have been attacked by snakes struggle and die or turn toward the icon that will save them. This is the most Mannerist of Michelangelo's earlier compositions at the Sistine Chapel, picking up the theme of human distress begun in the Great Flood scene and <b>carrying</b> <b>it</b> forward into the torment of lost souls in the Last Judgement, which was later painted below.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} in 1994, the AMIA bombing targeting a Buenos Aires Jewish center, that killed 85 people and wounded 300. The investigation remained open for years, and prosecutor Alberto Nisman {{was appointed to the}} case. He accused Iran of organizing the attack, and the Hezbollah group of <b>carrying</b> <b>it</b> out. He intended to prosecute five Iranian officials, including former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, but Argentina signed a memorandum of understanding with Iran for a joint investigation. Nisman accused the president of signing that memorandum for oil and trade benefits, according to hundreds of hours of wiretaps. On 19 January 2015 he was found dead at his home, a day before a congressional hearing to explain his accusation, which caused a great controversy. As of 2016, both the cases of the AMIA bombing and the death of Nisman remain unresolved, and the courts declined at the time to investigate his denunciation of Kirchner.|$|E

5|$|Eight {{additional}} Pendolinos {{were ordered}} {{at the end}} 1997 {{at the price of}} FIM 77 million per train (€13 million). They were delivered between 2000 and 2002. The main series trains differed in various ways from the prototypes. The new trains allowed Pendolino traffic to extend: they started running between Helsinki and Jyväskylä on 22 October 2001. In June 2002, the network was expanded further, and routes were continued from Tampere onwards to Oulu and from Jyväskylä to Kuopio. One of the main series trains (number 7x08) was damaged during maritime transport in October 2001. The badly secured train had come loose during a storm on the Atlantic, almost causing the loss of M/S Traden, the ship <b>carrying</b> <b>it.</b> Thanks to good actions of the ship's crew, it was able to reach Le Havre and the train was sent back to Italy to be repaired.|$|E
5|$|From {{this point}} northwestward to Rochester, NY96 passes through {{substantially}} more developed areas. The {{first of these}} is the nearby village of Victor, which NY96 enters by way of an overpass <b>carrying</b> <b>it</b> over the Ontario Central Railroad. In the village itself, the route meets the northern terminus of NY444, which travels north–south between Victor and Bloomfield. West of the village in the town of Victor, NY96 runs along the base of a valley separating it from the Thruway, where it intersects the eastern terminus of NY251. The route continues on a northwesterly track for another mile (1.6km) before curving to the north and widening from two to four lanes as it passes under the Thruway near exit45. I-490, which begins at Thruway exit45, is accessible from NY96 by way of exit29, the eastern-most exit on I-490.|$|E
5|$|In early 1944, Morotai {{became an}} area of {{importance}} to the Japanese military when it started developing the neighbouring larger island of Halmahera as {{a focal point for}} the defence of the southern approaches to the Philippines. In May 1944, the Imperial Japanese Army's 32nd Division arrived at Halmahera to defend the island and its nine airstrips. The division had suffered heavy losses when the convoy <b>carrying</b> <b>it</b> from China (the Take Ichi convoy) was attacked by US submarines. Two battalions from the 32nd Division's 211th Infantry Regiment were initially deployed to Morotai to develop an airstrip on the Doroeba Plain. Both battalions were withdrawn to Halmahera in mid-July, however, when the airstrip was abandoned because of drainage problems. Allied code breakers detected the Japanese build up at Halmahera and Morotai's weak defenses, and passed this information on to the relevant planning staff.|$|E

5|$|While Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) and a newly {{returned}} Kara Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) head to Galactica, {{the advancing}} Cylons destroy one ship and damage others, {{killing at least}} 600. After discovering their true identities, Cylons Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan), Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma), Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco), and Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) continue their jobs. Tigh is ordered to send every Viper to defend the fleet, but has a vision where he assassinates Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) before <b>carrying</b> <b>it</b> out. New Viper pilot Anders is sent out, worried a hidden Cylon program would activate and make him turn against the fleet. His guns are unresponsive while targeting a Raider. As Anders and the Raider come face-to-face, the Raider scans Anders, and in doing so, Anders' iris momentarily glows red. In response to this, the Raider flips direction and it, {{along with all the}} other Raiders, immediately stop the attack and retreat to their basestar and jump away, much to the surprise of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|The Horsa and Hamilcar gliders of {{the brigade}} landed at 21:00 on 6 June in a landing zone cleared of {{obstructions}} by the 5th Parachute Brigade. The primary tasks of the brigade were {{to bring in}} reinforcements and supplies, and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was {{to aid in the}} latter task, acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter-attack. The Tetrarchs of 'A' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed, but the squadron's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy. It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was <b>carrying</b> <b>it,</b> causing both to fall into the sea mid-flight. The squadron's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone, destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down, rendering it unusable, although the crew escaped without injury. The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions, forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches.|$|E
