40|$|The North East Dublin {{area has}} been {{identified}} {{for the development of}} a plan addressing health inequality and promoting a Healthy Community (WTO 2011) by the Northside Partnership (NSP), a local development company established in 1991 to address social exclusion, and the Dublin North Health Promotion Department. Poor health has been identified as an issue for people who live in areas affected by structural disadvantage and social exclusion in North East Dublin. A community survey in 2008 and a health needs assessment in 2003 both highlighted risk factors for high levels of chronic disease risks in the surveyed neighbourhoods and raised problems relating to mental health, income levels and environmental issues which all impact on health. Sustainable transport was identified as one of the key areas which could bring social, economic, environmental and health gains to the Pilot Area. Since 2013 DIT Environment & Planning have engaged with the NSP through the auspices of DIT Students Learning with Communities to support the Healthy <b>Communities</b> <b>Pilot</b> <b>Project.</b> DITs area of input is to study specifically transport and mobility within the pilot area As part of the area-wide cycling audit carried out in 2014, the Santry River Greenway Corridor was identified as a key potential resource for increasing mobility, health and long-term social inclusion within the Pilot Area. The greenway is identified as part of the Strategic Green Network in the National Transport Authority (NTA) Cycle Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA). Yet, of all the greenways, it alone has not commenced through the planning stages.

40|$|The {{well being}} of {{indigenous}} coastal communities is directly dependent upon the health of coral reef ecosystems. Coral reefs are vital providers of protein rich foods for island communities and provide needed income for fisheries and tourism resources. Unfortunately with the increasing development pressures and related negative human impacts, coral reefs are rapidly declining. Recent initiatives by the Department of Fisheries, non-governmental organizations, coastal communities and other stakeholders have focused on restoring coral reefs ecosystems. However, there are fewer integrated efforts towards controlling and or managing land based sources of waste entering the marine environment. Most industries located along coastal areas dispose liquid wastes directly into rivers or the sea without adequately treating it to a higher quality.

40|$|The authors {{call for}} a revised model for the {{regulation}} of industrial pollution. They think the traditional emphasis on appropriate instruments, while ultimately correct, is premature, because agencies in most developing countries have insufficient information and burdensome transaction costs to implement any instruments comprehensively. Once regulators have better information, more integrated information systems, more capacity for setting priorities, and a stronger public mandate, {{it will not be}} difficult for them to manage pollution more cost-effectively. Overhasty production of market-based instruments will not work and will probably discredit those regulatory tools. Rather, the new model of regulation should relegate regulators to their proper place in the scheme of things. The state should play a role in regulating pollution externalities, but should also recognize the role of the community and the market. In the authors'view, appropriate regulation in developing countries should incorporate five key features, namely, it should foster a climate of information intensity, encourage community environmental education, allow variations in regulations in different <b>communities,</b> initiate <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> and build larger programs later, and fashion adaptive regulatory instruments that both counter environmental degradation and minimize disruption for investors.

40|$|Background: In England {{over the}} last two decades, there has been a growing {{interest}} in the role of English schools in developing, facilitating and supporting young people's community participation. A number of policy initiatives have sought to build the capacity and opportunities for youth participation. Research suggests, however, that pupils and schools are often prohibited by significant barriers from becoming involved with community activities, particularly those that might occur beyond the school environment itself. In March 2010, the UK Labour government launched a Youth Community Action initiative for England, piloted across five local authorities, which aimed to involve young people of 14 – 16 years of age in community action. Following the UK general election in May 2010, the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government terminated these pilots but was quick to announce the launch and piloting of a National Citizen Service for 16 – 19 -year-olds in England. Purpose: Drawing on research conducted with participants in one Youth <b>Community</b> Action <b>pilot</b> <b>project,</b> the aim {{of this study was to}} explore the perceptions and understandings of young people regarding their involvement in community action activities and how this compared with the perceptions and understandings of the teachers responsible for co-ordinating such activities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a recent <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> aimed at obtaining optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates from a group of ancient irrigation dams in central India. The dams are all situated within an area of 750 km 2 around the wellknown Buddhist site of Sanchi, the latter established in c. third century B. C. and having a continuous constructional sequence up to the twelfth century A. D. They were documented during earlier seasons of the Sanchi Survey, initiated in 1998 in order to relate the site to its wider archaeological landscape. The <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> builds upon earlier hypotheses regarding the chronology and function of the Sanchi dams and their relationship to religious and political history in Central India. The principal suggestion is that the earliest phase of dam construction coincided with the rise of urbanization and the establishment of Buddhism in central India between c. third and second centuries B. C.; and that they were connected with wet-rice cultivation as opposed to wheat, the main agricultural staple today. Similarities with intersite patterns in Sri Lanka, where monastic landlordism is attested from c. second century B. C. onward, have also led to the working hypothesis that the Sanchi dams were central to the development of exchange systems between Buddhist monks and local agricultural <b>communities.</b> The <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> focused on two {{out of a total of}} 16 dam sites in the Sanchi area and involved scraping back dam sections created by modern road cuttings. This cast new light on aspects of dam construction and allowed for the collection of sediments and ceramics for OSL dating. The results confirmed the suitability of local sediments to OSL dating methods, as well as affirming our working hypothesis that the dams were constructed-along with the earliest Buddhist monuments in Central India-in the late centuries B. C. Sediment samples were also collected from cores hand drilled in the dried-up reservoir beds, for supplementary OSL dating and pollen analysis, which shed useful insights into land use.

40|$|A 'college without walls' {{is gaining}} {{strength}} in Zimbabwe and in June {{this year will}} begin to offer training in sustainable agriculture and <b>community</b> development. This <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> being established {{under the auspices of}} the PELUM (Participatory Ecological Land Use Management) Association is bringing together universities, national NGOs, community based organisations and government departments in a unique alliance to pool resources and offer training that might be beyond the scope of a single organisation. The PELUM College Zimbabwe draws on the resources of 15 organisations to fulfill its role in training NGO staff with an ultimate aim of tackling continuing problems such as land degradation, top-down extension, and ad hoc NGO activities. PELUM itself was officially launched in 1995 based on a four-year planning period by NGOs in Eastern and Southern Africa. It is optimistic about its long-term survival largely because it believes its roots are firmly in the region and it is evolving as a direct result of felt rather than perceived needs. There are currently around 60 members and a regional co-ordinating desk based in Harare. The association centres around the joint development of curricula by its members but it has also given itself the task of making existing training materials more easily available in the region. Other objectives include the provision of appropriate accreditation for its courses, the establishment of working groups and the development of an up-to-date inventory of resource peronnnel. A number of innovative approaches have developed and evolved over the last 30 years, say the organisation. These include, for example, participatory rural appraisal, holistic resource management, permaculture, training for transformation, the organisational workshop, low-external-input sustainable agriculture and the recognition of indigenous knowledge. Using practical activities the aim is to try to bridge the canyon that still remains between awareness raising and action on the ground; PELUM is taking up the challenge to adapt and link them using the experience of people already working in the region. This experience, they say, needs to be put in a form than can be widely shared to avoid it being lost and PELUM's networking approach will help the process.

Sixteen <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> conducted within the WINN innovation program in the Netherlands are analysed and three floodplain restoration <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> in the Rhine Basin are studied in-depth. These include the <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> on the floodplains of Beuningen (the Netherlands), in Polder Altenheim (Germany) and in Basel (Switzerland). Insights are developed regarding different types of <b>pilot</b> <b>projects,</b> different reasons actors have for initiating or participating in a <b>pilot</b> <b>project,</b> effects that <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> have on policy and practice, and factors that influence the diffusion process. By deepening understanding of <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> as instruments to practice changes and potentially change practices, this book contributes both to public policy theory and <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> practice.

40|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>projects</b> are favoured {{instruments}} for exploring and perhaps realising policy change. The challenges that coastal policy faces, {{the frequency with}} which <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> are implemented, and the criticisms regarding their efficacy make it interesting and relevant to study <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> in this policy field. This dissertation on ‘Narrative perspectives on the development of coastal pilot projects’ aims to deepen understanding of the development of <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> in their actor-networks. It utilises the concept of narratives both in the conceptualisation of the development of <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> and in the design of a research strategy, choosing to learn from the experiences of actors involved in coastal <b>pilot</b> <b>projects.</b> The Sand Engine in the Netherlands and Ystad’s sand nourishment project in Scania, Sweden, are the two coastal <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> from which empirical data are drawn. Retrospective biographies of the Sand Engine <b>pilot</b> <b>project,</b> and the narrative competitions active in both the Sand Engine and Ystad cases were identified using deductive and inductive narrative analysis methods. This thesis highlights that <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> function not only as learning {{instruments for}} understanding the (bio) physical system, but also as instruments where actor-based learning is storified and success can be claimed and institutionally anchored.
