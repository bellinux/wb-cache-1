40|$|We studied four {{patients}} with {{acute renal failure}} associated with nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis to evaluate the presence and progression of <b>calcium</b> <b>deposits</b> in damaged muscle tissue. Conventional and electron radiography and technetium- 99 m diphosphonate (TcDP) scans were done during the oliguric phase of acute renal failure and repeated after renal function returned to normal. Three patients showed <b>deposits</b> of <b>calcium</b> by conventional radiography and all by electron radiography and TcDP during the oliguric period. When the patients recovered renal function and muscle injuries healed, <b>calcium</b> <b>deposits</b> disappeared. The results show that <b>calcium</b> <b>deposits</b> in damaged muscle occur during the oliguric phase of acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis and the calcification disappears with recovery of renal failure; and TcDP scans are the most sensitive method of detecting <b>calcium</b> <b>deposits</b> in these patients. S E V E R E HYPOCALCEMIA is usually seen during the oli-guric phase of acute renal failure associated with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis, and hypercalcemia may occur in 20 % to 25 % of such patients during the diuretic phase (1 - 7). These disturbances in serum calcium concentration {{have been attributed to}} <b>calcium</b> <b>deposits</b> in damaged muscles during oliguria and remobilization of calcium from muscles to extracellular space during polyuria (1, 2).

In 2002, {{he was the}} first true freshman to start the season opener on Georgia's defensive line since Travis Stroud in 1994. [...] He was named Freshman All-America third-team and Freshman All-SEC first-team by The Sporting News. Golston played in all 14 games, starting three, and recorded 34 tackles (ten individual) with 2.5 stops for losses and a forced fumble. [...] During that season, the team won Georgia's first SEC Championship in 20 years, defeated Florida State University to win the 2003 Sugar Bowl and set a school record for most victories in a season (13). [...] After the season ended he had a steel rod removed from his leg, which had been inserted after the car accident in 2001. During the surgery, the doctors also found a <b>calcium</b> <b>deposit</b> nearly four inches long in his hip and removed it. [...] During his sophomore season, Golston suffered a broken shoulder blade during practice and was limited to eight games. As a junior, he was the recipient of the Coaches Leadership Award for defense, and earned All-SEC honorable mention. He posted 23 tackles (12 individual) with 2.5 stops for losses while starting every game. [...] Golston played in ten games as a senior, with nine starts after being hindered by an elbow injury. He recorded 21 tackles (13 individual), 1.5 sacks, and 28 quarterback pressures, which ranked second on the team.|$|E

One track from this - [...] "Ballroom Blitz" [...] - appeared as the B-side of I Just Can't Be Happy Today. Shortly after recording the classic Ace of Spades album in 1980, Taylor broke his neck after being lifted above the head of a friend in a test of strength, only to be dropped upon his head. Taylor continued to play in Motörhead {{with the aid of a}} neck brace, as is visible in the music video for [...] "Ace of Spades". As a result, Taylor had a prominent lump located on the back of his neck (affectionately referred to as his [...] "knob"), thought to be a <b>calcium</b> <b>deposit</b> caused by his previous spinal trauma. Tour-disrupting injuries were not unfamiliar to Taylor at the time, as he had previously broken his hand whilst punching a man outside his flat in London. In typical uncompromising Motörhead style, Taylor continued to drum by using gaffer tape to attach his drum stick into his hand until it had sufficiently healed. After a 'final' appearance on The Young Ones in 1984, Taylor left Motörhead. The following year, he made appearances with Waysted, and joined another ex-Motörhead man, Brian Robertson (from Thin Lizzy), to form the band Operator. In 1986, he was part of Frankie Miller's touring band.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{atherosclerotic}} calcification in plaque rupture remains controversial. In previous analyses using {{finite element}} model analysis, circumferential stress was reduced by {{the inclusion of a}} <b>calcium</b> <b>deposit</b> in a representative human anatomical configuration. However, a recent report, also using finite element analysis, suggests that microscopic calcium deposits increase plaque stress. We used mathematical models to predict the effects of rigid and liquid inclusions (modeling a <b>calcium</b> <b>deposit</b> and a lipid necrotic core, respectively) in a distensible material (artery wall) on mechanical failure under uniaxial and biaxial loading in a range of configurations. Without inclusions, stress levels were low and uniform. In the analytical model, peak stresses were elevated at the edges of a rigid inclusion. In the {{finite element model}}, peak stresses were elevated at the edges of both inclusions, with minimal sensitivity to the wall distensibility and {{the size and shape of}} the inclusion. Presence of both a rigid and a soft inclusion enlarged the region of increased wall stress compared with either alone. In some configurations, the rigid inclusion reduced peak stress at the edge of the soft inclusion but simultaneously increased peak stress at the edge of the rigid inclusion and increased the size of the region affected. These findings suggest that the presence of a <b>calcium</b> <b>deposit</b> creates local increases in failure stress, and, depending on relative position to any neighboring lipid pools, it may increase peak stress and the plaque area at risk of mechanical failure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCalcific {{aortic valve}} disease (CAVD) {{is a leading}} {{cardiovascular}} disorder in the elderly. While aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) are the main cells that express osteogenic mediators, the molecular mechanism that mediates AVIC osteogenic responses is incompletely understood. This study aims to identify pro-osteogenic factors in human AVICs affected by CAVD. Methods and resultsMicroarray analysis identified 11 up-regulated genes in AVICs of diseased valves. Among these genes, mRNA levels of neurotrophin 3 (NT 3) increased by 2 fold. Higher levels of NT 3 protein in diseased aortic valves and diseased AVICs were confirmed by immunofluorescent staining and immunoblotting, respectively. An exposure of AVICs of normal valves to recombinant human NT 3 (0. 025 – 0. 10 μg/mL) up-regulated the production of Runx 2, TGF-β 1 and BMP- 2 in a dose-dependent fashion. NT 3 also promotes <b>calcium</b> <b>deposit</b> formation. The pro-osteogenic effect of NT 3 was not affected by neutralization of Toll-like receptor 2 or 4. Interestingly, mRNA encoding neural growth factor receptors (TrkA, TrkB, TrkC and p 75 NTR) was detectable in human AVICs. Inhibition of Trk receptors markedly reduced the effects of NT 3 on Runx 2, TGF-β 1 and BMP- 2 production, <b>calcium</b> <b>deposit</b> formation and Akt phosphorylation. Further, inhibition of Akt also reduced the pro-osteogenic effects of NT 3. ConclusionsAVICs of diseased human aortic valves express higher levels of NT 3. NT 3 up-regulates the production of Runx 2, TGF-β 1 and BMP- 2, and promotes <b>calcium</b> <b>deposit</b> formation in human AVICs via the Trk–Akt pathway. Thus, NT 3 is a novel pro-osteogenic factor in aortic valves and {{may play a role}} in valvular calcification...|$|E

AimThe aim {{of the study was to}} investigate dose distribution perturbations due to the presence of stent struts, guide wire and <b>calcium</b> <b>deposits</b> during the irradiation. Both experimental and calculational techniques were applied to elucidate these influences. Materials/MethodsThe measurements were carried out with radiochromic foil in a phantom in the presence and absence of the stent and the guide wire. Due to the measurements being limited by the thickness of the detecting foil, the radial dose distribution with or without the metallic stent components were also performed using the MCNP Monte Carlo code. The same code was used to measure the influence of cholesterol plaques on dose distribution in the vessel walls. ResultsA large dose reduction in the area shielded by the guide wire was observed. The presence of the stent caused a 15 % dose reduction behind the struts. The dose reduction caused by <b>calcium</b> <b>deposits</b> ranged from 11 % to 32 %. ConclusionsThese facts may increase the probability of late restenosis after irradiation due to underdosage.

Pediatric kidney stones and urine were collected and both cultured and sequenced for bacteria. Bacterial adhesion to calcium oxalate was compared. Murine kidney <b>calcium</b> oxalate <b>deposits</b> were induced by intraperitoneal glyoxalate injection and kidneys were transurethrally inoculated with uropathogenic Escherichia coli to induce pyelonephritis. E. coli of the family Enterobacteriaceae was identified in patients by calcium oxalate stone culture. Additionally Enterobacteriaceae DNA was sequenced from multiple calcium oxalate kidney stones. E. coli selectively aggregated on and around calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals. Mice inoculated with glyoxalate and uropathogenic E. coli had higher bacterial burdens, increased kidney <b>calcium</b> oxalate <b>deposits</b> and an increased kidney innate immune response compared to mice with only <b>calcium</b> oxalate <b>deposits</b> or only pyelonephritis.
