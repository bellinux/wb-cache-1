40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{procedure}} is to prevent worker exposure to hazardous energy (such as from unexpected energization, start up, or release of stored energy). It <b>covers</b> <b>locking</b> out a machine, equipment, or system for which all the following conditions are met: 1. Has a single source of hazardous energy that can be readily identified, isolated, locked out; and that the single source controls all hazards, with no potential for stored energy 2. Involves only one department, group, craft, or employer, and does not involve a shift change 3. Contains no potential to release a hazardous material Lockouts that meet these conditions are considered simple. If any of these conditions are not met (for example, there are multiple energy sources or multiple groups), the lockout is considered complex and this procedure may not be used. Instead, an equipment-specific lockout procedure (ELP) or a group lockout procedure must be used (see Control of Hazardous Energy: General Requirements). This procedure applies to workers, supervisors, and equipment custodians...|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper is}} focused on {{analysing}} an integrated reconfigurable control and guidance approach for recovering a small fixed-wing UAV from different actuator faults, which <b>cover</b> <b>locked</b> in place (stuck) and loss of effectiveness. The model of the UAV Aerosonde is used to develop a reconfigurable control system based on the control allocation technique {{for a variety of}} faults, such as locked-in-place control surfaces. It is shown through simulation that the developed technique is successful to recover the aircraft from various faults but cannot guarantee success on the planned mission. For mission scenarios where performance degradation is such that the prescribed trajectory cannot be achieved, a reconfigurable guidance system is developed, which is capable of adapting parameters such as the minimum turning radius and the look-ahead distance for obstacle avoidance, to allow the vehicle to dynamically generate a path which guides the aircraft around the no-fly zones taking into account the post-fault reduced performance. Path following is performed by means of a non-linear lateral guidance law and a collision avoidance algorithm is implemented as well. Finally, the integration of control reconfiguration and guidance adaptation is carried out to maximise probabilities of post-failure success in the mission. A methodology is developed, using an error based control allocation parameter, as a measure of performance degradation, which links both reconfiguration and guidance systems. The developed method, although approximate, is proven to be an efficient way of allocating the required degree of reconfiguration in guidance commands when an accurate prediction of the actual performance is not available...|$|R

50|$|The risk of firemen {{tying down}} the safety valve remained.

50|$|In some cases, such as {{equipment}} used in schools, community centers, or other public places, {{the equipment is}} designed so that {{some or all of}} the switches are hidden behind a <b>locked</b> <b>cover.</b> Some public address systems are sold in tamper-resistant designs that make it harder for unauthorized members of the public to activate the system or change the settings. The switches are at the rear of the unit; only LED lights are on the front of the panel. When the unit is rack-mounted into a wall or rack unit, this means that only official personnel (who are able to access the back of the panel) can change the settings or use the unit. Another variant on this design is to cover the switches with a locked panel. In some cases, such as the sound system in a bar or club, the <b>locked</b> <b>cover</b> may be made from transparent plexiglass, so that the sound engineer can verify the sound system settings and switches (yet at the same time, the locked panel prevents mischief-minded club patrons from tampering or altering the amplifier or equalizer settings).|$|R
