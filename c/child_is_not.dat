A person who is told to do {{something}} by his/her mother for which his father does not like the result is not permitted to tell his/her father that his/her mother said to do that.

25|$|Both {{in common}} law and in civil law, a rebuttable {{presumption}} (in Latin, praesumptio iuris tantum) is an assumption {{made by a}} court, one that is taken to be true unless someone comes forward to contest it and prove otherwise. For example, a defendant {{in a criminal case}} is presumed innocent until proved guilty. According to law, in an International child abduction the left behind parent is legally the only victim, if the <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does not {{have anything to do with}} children’s rights or welfare only parental rights.|$|E
25|$|If a woman {{gives birth}} to a second son {{naturally}} when the first son was born by Caesarean section, that <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> redeemed either. Additionally, a first-born male does not require redemption if his birth was preceded by an earlier miscarriage by the mother that occurred after the third month of pregnancy. However, if the miscarriage occurred during the first 40 days of pregnancy, redemption is required. If the previous miscarriage occurred after forty days, but before the fetus developed distinguishing characteristics, redemption of the first-born is still required, but the blessing said by the father is omitted.|$|E

25|$|In Israel, Jewish {{circumcision}} {{is entirely}} legal, as is posthumous circumcision. In 1999, the Israeli Supreme Court overruled {{an attempt to}} have after-death circumcision outlawed. Though illegal, female circumcision is still practiced among the Negev Bedouin, and tribal secrecy among the Bedouin {{makes it difficult for}} authorities to enforce the ban. In 2013, Rabbinical court in Israel ordered a mother, Elinor Daniel, to circumcise her son or pay a fine of 500 Israeli Shekel for every day that the <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> circumcised. She appealed against the Rabbinical court ruling and the High Court ruled in her favour stating, among other considerations, the basic right of freedom from religion.|$|E
25|$|A {{child born}} within 12months of a woman's most recent meeting {{with her husband}} is presumed to be legitimate, since Jewish law {{believes}} that in rare cases a pregnancy can last that long (4:14). However, if more than 9months have elapsed and she {{is known to have}} been unfaithful then the presumption does not apply (Even haEzer Rama 4:14). Modern assisted reproductive technology has complicated the issue. Moshe Feinstein ruled that if a married woman is inseminated by sperm from another man the <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a mamzer, since it did not result from an act of adultery; Joel Teitelbaum (2005) disagreed, and ruled that since the child is known to be that of a man other than her husband it is a mamzer.|$|E
25|$|International child {{abduction}} occurs when one parent takes (or retains) a child before child custody ends at age 18, {{to a foreign}} country (example China, India and Japan) and keeps him or her there without the other parent’s permission. If that parent refuses to bring the child {{under the age of}} 16 back to the United States, it’s considered a federal crime in the United States. It does not matter if the child does not want to return to the United States, or if the courts in the other country (example China, India and Japan) allow the taking parent to keep the child in the other country (example China, India and Japan). The taking parent can face up to three years in United States Federal prison, even when the child is over the age of 18, does not want to ever see the left behind parent again and does not want the taking parent to face criminal charges or go to jail. According to law, the left behind parent is legally the only victim if the <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does not {{have anything to do with}} children’s rights or welfare only parental rights. This is because the courts in other country's (example China, Japan and India) do not enforce a US child custody order.|$|E

500|$|There are ethical {{concerns}} {{related to}} prenatal genetic testing or {{preimplantation genetic diagnosis}} to ensure a <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> born with a given disease.

As it is a dominant disease, there are difficulties in situations in which a parent {{does not want to}} know his or her own diagnosis.

500|$|Children are {{the supreme}} gift of {{marriage}} and contribute greatly to {{the good of the}} parents themselves.

(Gaudium et spes)." [...] It recognizes that responsible parenthood sometimes calls for reasonable spacing or limiting of births and considers natural family planning as morally acceptable, but rejects all methods of artificial contraception. The Church rejects all forms of artificial insemination and fertilization because the techniques divorce the sexual act from the creation of a child.

Toofer learns that he is a direct descendant of Tobias Spurlock, a black Confederate soldier. Tracy and Toofer are upset about the news until Tracy has a dream in which Thomas Jefferson (portrayed by Jack Donaghy) appears to him on The Maury Povich Show.

Æthelfrith himself appears to have been king of [...] "Northumbria"—both Deira and Bernicia—by no later than 604. During the reign of Æthelfrith, Edwin was an exile. The location of his early exile as a <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known, but late traditions, reported by Reginald of Durham and Geoffrey of Monmouth, place Edwin in the kingdom of Gwynedd, fostered by king Cadfan ap Iago, so allowing biblical parallels to be drawn from the struggle between Edwin and his supposed foster-brother Cadwallon.
