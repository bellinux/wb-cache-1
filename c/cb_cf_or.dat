We introduce a multiple input deep regression model to predict the CF latent embedding vectors of items based on their textual description and metadata. We showcase the effectiveness of the proposed model by predicting the CF vectors of movies and apps based on their textual descriptions. Finally, we show that the model can be further improved by incorporating metadata such as the movie release year and tags which contribute to a higher accuracy...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: Studies exploring carbon-based reinforcement in SMP composites for electrically conductive performance and Joule heating triggered shape recovery have been included, especially for the principle design, characterisation and shape recovery behaviour, making the article a comprehensive account of the systemic progress in SMP composite incorporating conductive carbon reinforcement. Findings: SMPs are fascinating materials and have attracted great academic and industrial attention owing to their significant macroscopic shape deformation {{in the presence of}} an appropriate stimulus. The working mechanisms, the physico requirements and the theoretical origins of the different types of carbon-based reinforcement SMP composites have been discussed. Current research and development on the fabrication strategies of carbon-based reinforcement SMP composites have been summarised. Research limitations/implications: A systematic review is to evaluate carbon-based reinforcements in SMPs for electrical actuation and discuss recent developments and future applications. Practical implications: Carbon-based reinforcements in SMPs can be used as smart deployable space structure in the broad field of aerospace technologies.

40|$|This is {{the second}} in a series on {{configurations}} in an abelian category A. Given a finite poset (I, ≼), an (I, ≼) -configuration (σ, ι, π) is a finite collection of objects σ(J) and morphisms ι(J, K) or π(J, K) : σ(J) → σ(K) in A satisfying some axioms, where J, K ⊆ I. Configurations describe how an object X in A decomposes into subobjects. The first paper defined configurations and developed their basic properties and studied moduli spaces of (I, ≼) -configurations in A, using the theory of Artin stacks. It showed well-behaved moduli stacks M(I, ≼) A exist when A is the abelian category coh(P) of coherent sheaves on a projective scheme P, or mod-KQ of representations of a quiver Q. Let F be a field, and write <b>CF</b> <b>or</b> LCF(M(I, ≼) A) F for the F-valued (locally) constructible functions on M(I, ≼) A. Then natural 1 -morphisms between moduli stacks M(I, ≼) A, M(J,�) A induce pushforward and pullback maps between CF(M(I, ≼) A) F, CF(M(J, �) A) F. Using these we define many multilinear algebraic operations on <b>CF</b> <b>or</b> LCF(M(I, ≼) A) F, satisfying identities under composition.

The extent of palivizumab use in the CF and immunocompromised populations is variable. Palivizumab appears to be safe and may be effective in infants and young children with CF and immunocompromise.

Methods The CFTR genes from individuals who carried {{at least one of}} these changes were extensively scanned by a well established DGGE assay followed by direct sequencing and familial segregation analysis of mutations and polymorphisms. Results Four CF patients (out of 1238) originally identified as carrying the p. I 148 T mutation in trans with a CF mutation had a second mutation (c. 3199 del 6 or a novel mutation c. 3395 insA) on the p. I 148 T allele. We demonstrate here that the deletion c. 3199 del 6 can also be associated with CF without p. I 148 T. Three CBAVD patients originally identified with the complex allele p. R 74 W-p. D 1270 N were also carrying p. V 201 M on this allele, by contrast with non <b>CF</b> <b>or</b> asymptomatic individuals including the mother of a CF child, who were carrying p. R 74 W-p.

Each slice was trimmed with a fine diamond bur to reduce the buccal, internal slope enamel of the cusps to a dumb-bell shape with a cross-sectional area at the neck of less than 0. 5 mm(2). The samples were randomly divided into 12 groups (n= 11). The control groups were not submitted to the bleaching regimen.
