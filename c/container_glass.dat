The group has ventured into cement and concrete products, <b>container</b> <b>glass,</b> general insurance, radiators, plastics, hotels, and real estate. It was formed by Seán Quinn in 1973, developing from a small quarrying operation in Derrylin into a large organization, employing over 8,000 people in various locations throughout Europe.|$|E

25|$|Soda-lime-silica glass, window glass: silica + {{sodium oxide}} (Na2O) + lime (CaO) + {{magnesia}} (MgO) + alumina (Al2O3). Is transparent, easily formed and {{most suitable for}} window glass (see flat glass). It has a high thermal expansion and poor resistance to heat (500–600°C). It is used for windows, some low-temperature incandescent light bulbs, and tableware. <b>Container</b> <b>glass</b> is a soda-lime glass that is a slight variation on flat glass, which uses more alumina and calcium, and less sodium and magnesium, which are more water-soluble. This makes it less susceptible to water erosion.|$|E
