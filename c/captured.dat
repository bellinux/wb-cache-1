5|$|Except for {{any move}} of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is <b>captured</b> (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces {{it on its}} square (en passant is the only exception).

Two DANA self-propelled howitzers of the Georgian army were destroyed in combat and two DANAs were <b>captured</b> in and near Gori. Further 20 artillery pieces, including 120 mm mortars, were left behind. Six 2S7 Pions were <b>captured</b> after the hostilities.

In our previous work of hydrodynamic cell <b>capture,</b> the laminar flow with abrupt expansion in a mircowell restricts the <b>capture</b> efficiency by diverting cells {{away from the}} <b>capture</b> site, which results in low <b>capture</b> rate. In this work, we used herringbone vortices to steer cells towards the <b>capture</b> site to facilitate cell <b>capture</b> efficiency. The proposed design achieves ~ 65 % <b>capture</b> efficiency when loading only 20, 40 and 60 MDA-MB- 321 (breast cancer) cells. Compared to the <b>capture</b> efficiency of ~ 35 % without the herringbone, the proposed cell-focusing <b>capture</b> scheme demonstrates the feasibility for small samples analysis...|$|R

Separate saccade and attend-only conditions contained a color target appearing either singly, with an onset or color distractor, or both. In singleton mode, onsets produced oculomotor and attentional <b>capture.</b> In feature mode, <b>capture</b> was absent or greatly reduced, providing evidence for top-down modulation of {{both types of}} <b>capture.</b> Although attentional <b>capture</b> by color abstractors was present throughout, oculomotor <b>capture</b> by color occurred only when accompanied by transient change, providing evidence for a dissociation between oculomotor and attentional <b>capture.</b> Oculomotor and attentional <b>capture</b> appear to be mediated by top-down attentional control settings, but transient change may be necessary for oculomotor <b>capture.</b> ((c) 2003 APA, all rights reserved) ...|$|R

By reducing technical and economic disincentives for first movers, partial <b>capture</b> can serve as an important near-term strategy to meet electrical demand while expediting widespread deployment of full <b>capture...</b>|$|R
