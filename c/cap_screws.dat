50|$|Compared to cork, <b>screw</b> <b>caps</b> {{reduce the}} wine faults of {{oxidation}} and of cork taint, {{although it is}} possible to find TCA contamination in a <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> bottle. <b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> are generally perceived as easier to open. <b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> have a much lower failure rate than cork, and in theory will allow a wine to reach the customer in perfect condition, with a minimum of bottle variation.

5000|$|ASME {{standard}} B18.2.1-1996 specifies Hex <b>Cap</b> <b>Screws</b> whose {{size range}} is 0.25 - 3 in in diameter. These fasteners {{are very similar}} to hex bolts.

Reasonably, these fasteners might be referred to as bolts, but based on the US government document Distinguishing Bolts from Screws, the US government might classify them as screws because of the tighter tolerance. In 1991 responding to an influx of counterfeit fasteners Congress passed PL 101-592 [...] "Fastener Quality Act" [...] This resulted in the rewriting of specifications by the ASME B18 committee.

50|$|Work {{hardening}} may {{be desirable}} or undesirable {{depending on the}} context. An example of undesirable work hardening is during machining when early passes of a cutter inadvertently work-harden the workpiece surface, causing damage to the cutter during the later passes. Certain alloys {{are more prone to}} this than others; superalloys such as Inconel require machining strategies that take it into account. An example of desirable work hardening is that which occurs in metalworking processes that intentionally induce plastic deformation to exact a shape change. These processes are known as cold working or cold forming processes. They are characterized by shaping the workpiece at a temperature below its recrystallization temperature, usually at ambient temperature. Cold forming techniques are usually classified into four major groups: squeezing, bending, drawing, and shearing. Applications include the heading of bolts and <b>cap</b> <b>screws</b> and the finishing of cold rolled steel. In cold forming, metal is formed at high speed and high pressure using tool steel or carbide dies. The cold working of the metal increasing the hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and evaluate methods of improving fastener and joint performance in wood-based composite case furniture. In general, several types of joints and fasteners were tested and evaluated. This study, accordingly, provides much of the information needed for the product engineering of case furniture constructed of particleboard and medium density fiberboard. In order to achieve the desired objective and to produce practical results, the boards chosen for the project were representative of the quality of the material usually used in the construction of case furniture. Results of the edge breaking strength tests indicated that breaking strength of the corner joints increased approximately in proportion to the square root of both IB and MOR properties. A clear relationship between edge breaking strength and MOE, MOR, and IB could not be found in either the tension or the compression tests. Edge pull-out test results indicated that edge distance and hole diameter have a significant effect on the edge pull-out strength of the particleboard and medium density fiberboard. Test results for withdrawal strength of screws indicate that both face and edge withdrawal strength of screws were close to what have been obtained in the previous studies done by Eckelman. Using adhesive with screw, withdrawal strength resistance was increased in both MDF and particleboard panels. It is clear that the performance of the joints is not related to the cost of the fasteners. In many cases, joints with low performance were the most expensive. <b>Cap</b> <b>screws,</b> for example, had the highest cost but low performance. On the other hand, sheet metal screws with glue were cheaper but higher in performance. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to show a simple and {{predictable}} technique to enhance both the vestibular/buccal (V/B) gingival thickness (GT) and keratinized tissue width (KTW) improving the soft-tissue profile after flapless implant placement. The technique proposed was named Modified Connective Tissue Punch (MCTP). Fourteen patients (6 men and 8 women) aged between 35 and 69 years (mean value 48. 07 ± 13. 023 years) were enrolled in this case series. Seventeen implant sites were submitted to flapless procedure. The connective punch (CP) was harvested with a motor-driven circular tissue punch and then a full-split dissection was executed, in order to create a deep pouch, beyond the mucogingival junction, on the V/B side. In this recipient site the CP was placed. The normal flapless surgical protocol was used; implants were inserted and covered with transgingival healing <b>cap</b> <b>screws.</b> GT and KTW were measured: both immediately before and after surgery; at the time of the prosthetic finalization (3 - 4 months, respectively, for mandible and maxilla); 1 year post surgery follow-up. GT was measured at 1 mm, 2 mm and 5 mm on the V/B side, from the outline of the punch. Both KTW and GT at 1 and 2 mm can be effectively increased, while no significant effects for GT at 5 mm can be expected from this technique. Furthermore, the mean values of KTW and GT at 1 mm and 2 mm show significant increases at 3 - 4 months post-operative, while no further significant increments are shown at 1 year post-operative follow-up. The Authors recommend the use of the MCTP technique to reduce the number of aesthetic complications and soft tissue defects in flapless implant surgery. Longer follow-ups are needed to evaluate the stability of peri-implant tissues over time...|$|E
40|$|In {{the wine}} closure {{industry}} cork remains the dominant bottle sealing technology with a {{market share of}} around 90 per cent. Our research analyses the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wine seal's development and original introduction within Australia in the 1970 s. It identifies the fundamental reasons for its initial commercial failure. The Australian wine industry {{played a leading role}} in recognizing the commercial potential of a French prototype <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal. Local piloting and testing occurred followed by a market launch. Unfortunately for <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> change agents, the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal was largely a failure. Rogers' (1995) innovation diffusion model identifies several underlying factors responsible for the customer's rejection of the new <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal. In particular, these were the failure to effectively demonstrate the relative advantage of the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> seal to consumers and to address the complexity and incompatibility of the seal with established user traditions. The industry was therefore unable to achieve a 'critical mass' of adoption. The additional application of Moore's (2001) adaptation of the technology adoption life cycle model reveals that the failure of the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> was also attributable to a lack of an effective industry marketing strategy that would overcome this identifiable consumer resistance.
