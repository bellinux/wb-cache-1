50|$|The {{lack of a}} {{locking bar}} on many Weaver-type {{accessories}} also lends to another alignment issue: Canting. Though this problem is not common {{it can be very}} problematic especially with scopes. Because scopes need to be mounted to a rifle in perfect parallel to the barrel and to ensure the cross hairs sit exactly where a bullet will go (POI), a small variation of even ¼ of one degree can cause massive problems at longer ranges. The locking bar holds the mount in a perfect 90 degree to the rail system where as a non-locking bar system can cant to the left or right. This canting (sometimes called jamming of surfaces) is caused by not matching the <b>clamping</b> <b>surface</b> perfectly to the rail. When tightened down, stress exerted on the base can cause the scope to be off from the POI by as much as several feet at 100-200 yards and gets progressively worse the farther out the range goes. Lower grade materials used in manufacturing of scope bases, inconsistent design tolerances from one manufacturer to another and other factors can cause twisting stress and cause the mount to move out of parallel with the rifle barrel. The locking bar system allows for even stress to be distributed and prevent canting of the scope mount.|$|E

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{stress state}} occurs during stamping in the flange of a blank, a characteristic feature {{of which is}} that one of the main stresses is compression, the other tension.

A system of equations of the hyperbolic type is obtained, which has two families of real characteristics, both of which coincide with the trajectories of the maxiumum tangential stresses and have the property of orthogonality. Using the method of characteristics, it is possible to construct the optimal contour of the blank which will ensure that there is no displacement along a contour of the die.

Early studies with the halogenated pyruvic acid derivatives demonstrated that central nervous system effects could be produced in doses of the same order of magnitude as those necessary to produce peripheral effects (Martin et al., 1957). It appeared that halo-genated pyruvic acids, unlike quaternary choline derivatives, could easily pass the blood brain barrier.

40|$|A single polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane {{fuel cell}} (PEMFC) {{is comprised of}} several sub-millimetre thick layers of varying porosity sandwiched together. The thickness of each layer, which typically ranges from 10 to 200 μm, is kept small {{in order to minimize}} the transport resistance of heat, mass, electrons, and protons, that limit reaction rate. However, the thickness of these materials presents a significant challenge to engineers characterizing the transport properties through them, which is of considerable importance to the development and optimization of fuel cells. The objective of this research is to address the challenges associated with measuring the heat conduction and gas diffusion transport properties of thin porous media used in PEMFCs. An improvement in the accuracy of the guarded heat flow technique for measuring thermal conductivity and the modified Loschmidt Cell technique for measuring gas diffusivity are presented for porous media with a sub-millimetre thickness. The improvement in accuracy is achieved by analyzing parameters in each apparatus that are sensitive to measurement error and have the largest contribution to measurement uncertainty, and then developing ways to minimize the error. The experimental apparatuses are used to investigate the transport properties of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and the microporous layer (MPL), while the methods would also be useful {{in the study of the}} catalyst layer (CL). Gas diffusion through porous media is critical for the high current density operation of a PEMFC, where the electrochemical reaction becomes rate-limited by the diffusive flux of reactants reaching reaction sites. However, geometric models that predict diffusivity of the GDL have been identified as inaccurate in current literature. Experimental results give a better estimate of diffusivity, but published works to date have been limited by high measurement uncertainty. In this thesis, the effective diffusivity of various GDLs are measured using a modified Loschmidt cell and the relative differences between GDLs are explained using scanning electron microscopy and the method of standard porosimetry. The experimental results from this study and others in current literature are used to develop a generalized correlation for predicting diffusivity as a function of porosity in the through-plane direction of a GDL. The thermal conductivity and contact resistance of porous media are important for accurate thermal analysis of a fuel cell, especially at high current densities where the heat flux becomes large. In this thesis, the effective through-plane thermal conductivity and contact resistance of the GDL and MPL are measured. GDL samples with and without a MPL and coated with 30 %-wt. PTFE are measured using the guarded steady-state heat flow technique described in the ASTM standard E 1225 - 04. Thermal contact resistance of the MPL with the iron <b>clamping</b> <b>surface</b> was found to be negligible, owing to the high surface contact area. Thermal conductivity and thickness of the MPL remained constant for compression pressures up to 15 bar at 0. 30 W/m°K and 55 μm, respectively. The thermal conductivity of the GDL substrate containing 30 %−wt. PTFE varied from 0. 30 to 0. 56 W/m°K as compression was increased from 4 to 15 bar. As a result, the GDL contain- ing MPL had a lower effective thermal conductivity at high compression than the GDL without MPL. At low compression, differences were negligible. The constant thickness of the MPL suggests that the porosity, as well as heat and mass transport properties, remain independent of the inhomogeneous compression by the bipolar plate. Despite the low effective thermal conductivity of the MPL, thermal performance of the GDL can be improved by exploiting the excellent surface contact resistance of the MPL while minimizing its thickness...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: DMA spectra {{were taken}} from tensile loaded neat and glass-fiber mat-reinforced {{polypropylene}} (GMT-PP) with different reinforcement fractions (Vf). Reliable data were achieved by using rectangular specimens of proper dimension, i. e., having a <b>clamped</b> <b>surface</b> of 60 x 15 mm 2. It was established that the &beta;- or Tg-transition of PP re-mains unaffected by adding GF mat. This was attributed {{to the fact that}} GF does not inter-fere with the crystallization. The &alpha;-transition, linked to the crystalline morphology, disap-peared by GF mat incorporation. It is reasonable that the GF mat, wetted by the matrix, overtakes the control in the rubbery region (between Tg and melting temperature, Tm) for the deformability from the matrix in the unreinforced state. The complex dynamic tensile modulus (E*) of the GMT-PP’s changed linearly with Vffor various temperatures, which allows a reliable estimation of the stiffness for different GMT-PP types.
