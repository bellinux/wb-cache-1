5|$|It {{appears that}} {{predation}} by invasive mammalian species including ship rats, cats, and mustelids was an additional {{factor in the}} decline in huia numbers – introduction of these animals by New Zealand acclimatisation societies peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly sharp decline in huia populations. Because it {{spent a lot of}} time on the ground, the huia would have been particularly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the <b>common</b> <b>myna.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{currently}} the largest banyan tree in Hawaii, {{and one of the}} largest banyan trees in the United States. The tree faces several threats, including soil compaction from foot and vehicle traffic due to tourism and special events in the park, drought, and the interruption of irrigation due to courthouse renovation. New restrictions were imposed in 2000 after the health of the tree began to decline. <b>common</b> <b>myna</b> birds (Acridotheres tristis) roost in the branches of the tree at sunset, causing a cacophony of bird cries as the evening approaches.|$|E
5|$|Several {{causes for}} the decline and sudden {{disappearance}} of the hoopoe starling have been proposed, all connected to the activities of humans on Réunion, who it survived alongside for two centuries. An oft-repeated suggestion is that {{the introduction of the}} <b>common</b> <b>myna</b> (Acridotheres tristis) led to competition between these two starling species. The myna was introduced to Réunion in 1759 to combat locusts, and became a pest itself. However, the hoopoe starling coexisted with the myna for nearly 100years and they may not have shared habitat. The black rat (Rattus rattus) arrived on Reunion in the 1670s, and the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in 1735, multiplying rapidly and threatening agriculture and native species. Like the hoopoe starling, the rats inhabited tree cavities and would have preyed on eggs, juveniles, and nesting birds. During the mid-19th century the Réunion slit-eared skink (Gongylomorphus borbonicus) became extinct due to predation by the introduced wolf snake (Lycodon aulicum), which may have deprived the bird of a significant food source. Hoopoe starlings may have contracted diseases from introduced birds, a factor known to have triggered declines and extinctions in endemic Hawaiian birds. According to ecologist Anthony S. Cheke, this was the chief cause of the hoopoe starling's extinction; the species had survived for generations despite other threats.|$|E
40|$|Invasive species present {{economic}} and ecological challenges worldwide. In many cases {{we are not}} aware of the full effect they have on the environment, the extent of any damage, or the factors contributing to their success. In this study we examined the foraging aggression of wild <b>Common</b> <b>Mynas</b> (Sturnus tristis) as a potential explanation for their invasive success, and quantified the effect of this behaviour on other birds. <b>Common</b> <b>Mynas</b> did not display significantly more aggression than other species, and displayed significantly less aggression than native Australian Magpies (Cracticus tibicen). Furthermore, the presence of <b>Common</b> <b>Mynas</b> at a feeding resource had no greater effect on the abundance of heterospecific individuals than the presence of any other species. Presence of each species was negatively correlated with the presence of other species, that is all species were less likely to approach the feeding station if any other species was present there. <b>Common</b> <b>Mynas</b> also did not displace other birds at feeding sites any more frequently than three of the other four species, and less frequently than two other native species. Overall, the findings suggest that <b>Common</b> <b>Mynas</b> do not display more food-related aggression than other species in suburban habitats, suggesting that competitive aggression over food {{is not likely to be}} one of the behavioural traits leading to the success of <b>Common</b> <b>Mynas</b> in suburban habitats...|$|R

40|$|Human {{activity}} can dramatically affect biodiversity, often by introducing non-native species, or {{by increasing the}} abundance of {{a small number of}} native species. Management strategies aimed at conserving biodiversity need to be informed by the actual impacts of highly abundant species, whether native or introduced. In this study we examined characteristics of two bird species, introduced <b>common</b> <b>mynas</b> and native noisy miners, both of which are highly abundant in urbanised areas along the East coast of Australia. Current managerial practices have a strong focus on eradication of <b>common</b> <b>mynas,</b> while noisy miners are largely ignored. However, in this study noisy miners were found in a broader range of habitats, and in greater abundance, than common mynas; displayed more aggressive behaviour; and were linked to a decline in the diversity and abundance of other species where <b>common</b> <b>mynas</b> were not. We suggest that the adaptability of a species and the variety of habitats it can colonise may be a better predictor of its potential impact, than whether it is native or introduced...|$|R
25|$|Sydney is home {{to dozens}} of bird species, which {{commonly}} include the Australian raven, Australian magpie, crested pigeon, noisy miner and the pied currawong, among others. Introduced bird species ubiquitously found in Sydney are the <b>common</b> <b>myna,</b> common starling, house sparrow and the spotted dove. Reptile species are also numerous and predominantly include skinks. Sydney has a few mammal and spider species, such as the grey-headed flying fox and the Sydney funnel-web, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to attribution of recent climate change, the City of Melbourne, in 2002, set a target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2020 and Moreland City Council established the Zero Moreland program, {{however not all}} metropolitan municipalities have followed, with the City of Glen Eira notably deciding in 2009 not to become carbon neutral. Melbourne {{has one of the}} largest urban footprints in the world due to its low density housing, resulting in a vast suburban sprawl, {{with a high level of}} car dependence and minimal public transport outside of inner areas. Much of the vegetation within the city are non-native species, most of European origin, and in many cases plays host to invasive species and noxious weeds. Significant introduced urban pests include the <b>common</b> <b>myna,</b> feral pigeon, brown rat, European wasp, common starling and red fox. Many outlying suburbs, particularly towards the Yarra Valley and the hills to the north-east and east, have gone for extended periods without regenerative fires leading to a lack of saplings and undergrowth in urbanised native bushland. The Department of Sustainability and Environment partially addresses this problem by regularly burning off. Several national parks have been designated around the urban area of Melbourne, including the Mornington Peninsula National Park, Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park and Point Nepean National Park in the south east, Organ Pipes National Park to the north and Dandenong Ranges National Park to the east. There are also a number of significant state parks just outside Melbourne. Responsibility for regulating pollution falls under the jurisdiction of the EPA Victoria and several local councils. Air pollution, by world standards, is classified as being good. Summer and autumn are the worst times of year for atmospheric haze in the urban area.|$|E

Fieldwork in the vicinity of Canberra found that vertebrates made up more of the diet in autumn and particularly winter. Although more invertebrates were eaten than vertebrates (even more so in autumn), they made up only 2.8% of the biomass consumed. Prey species were mainly mammals, predominantly the house mouse (Mus musculus), and also black rat (Rattus rattus), bush rat (R. fuscipes), and Gould's wattled bat (Chalinolobus gouldii), birds including common starling (Sturnus vulgaris), house sparrow, red-browed finch [...] (Neochmia temporalis), <b>common</b> <b>myna</b> (Acridotheres tristis), red-rumped parrot (Psephotus haematonotus), and white-browed babbler (Pomatostomus superciliosus), and invertebrates including grasshoppers, crickets, [...] beetles, cockroaches, moths, wolf spiders and huntsman spiders.

2500|$|Starlings {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} passerine {{birds in the}} family Sturnidae. The name [...] "Sturnidae" [...] comes from the Latin word for starling, sturnus. Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called mynas, and many African species are known as glossy starlings because of their iridescent plumage. Starlings are native to Europe, Asia and Africa, as well as northern Australia and the islands of the tropical Pacific. Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas as well as North America, Hawaii and New Zealand, where they generally compete for habitats with native birds and {{are considered to be}} invasive species. The starling species familiar to most people in Europe and North America is the common starling, and throughout much of Asia and the Pacific, the <b>common</b> <b>myna</b> is indeed common.|$|E
2500|$|A vocal animal, the chital, {{akin to the}} North American elk, {{gives out}} bellows and alarm barks. Its calls are, however, {{not as strong as}} those of elk or red deer; they are mainly coarse bellows or loud growls. [...] Bellowing coincides with rutting. Dominant males {{guarding}} females in oestrus make high-pitched growls at less powerful males. Males may moan during aggressive displays or while resting. The chital, mainly females and juveniles, will bark persistently when alarmed or if they encounter a predator. Fawns in search of their mother often squeal. The chital can respond to the alarm calls of several animals such as the <b>common</b> <b>myna</b> and langurs.Marking behaviour is pronounced in males. Males have well-developed preorbital glands (near the eyes). They stand on their hindlegs to reach tall branches and rub the open preorbital glands to deposit their scent there. This posture is also used while foraging. Urine-marking is also observed; the smell of urine is typically stronger than that of the deposited scent. Sparring between males begins with the larger male displaying his dominance before the other-this display consists of hissing heading away from the other male with the tail facing him, the nose pointing to the ground, the ears down, the antlers upright and the upper lip raised. The fur often bristles during the display. The male approaches the other in a slow gait. Males with velvet antlers may hunch over instead of standing erect as the males with hard antlers. The opponents then interlock their horns and push against each other, with the smaller male producing a sound at times which is louder than that produced by sambar deer {{but not as much as}} the barasinga's. The fight terminates with the males stepping backward, or simply leaving and foraging. Fights are not generally serious. Individuals may occasionally bite one another. <b>Common</b> <b>myna</b> are often attracted to the chital. An interesting relationship has been observed between herds of chital and troops of the northern plains gray langurs, a widespread South Asian monkey. Chital benefit from the langurs' eyesight and ability to post a lookout from trees, while the langur benefit from the chital's strong sense of smell-both of which help keep a check on potential danger. The chital also benefit from fruits dropped by langurs from trees such as Terminalia bellerica and Phyllanthus emblica. The chital has been observed foraging with sambar deer in the Western Ghats.|$|E
2500|$|The {{terrestrial}} aviary {{was opened}} in 1992, but was closed {{within a few}} years due to maintenance issues. It was renovated and reopened in 2010 as the Bio Centre.

40|$|Behavioural {{innovation}} {{is believed to}} be an important way in which animals devise solutions to new problems, yet the factors underpinning individual differences in innovation remain unclear.

To this aim, we measured experimentally the willingness of adult individuals to eat a new food (consumer innovation) and to develop a new foraging technique (motor innovation), as well as their degree of neophobia, exploration, shyness, motivation and activity levels. <b>Common</b> <b>mynas</b> showed some propensity for consumer and motor innovations, with 55 % and 22 % of individuals solving the respective tasks. Moreover, individuals that solved the task significantly decreased their latency to solve it subsequently, indicating that learning had occurred. Differences in problem-solving performance were not related to sex, and individuals that solved the consumer task did not solve the motor innovation task faster. The likelihood of solving the motor task increased with propensity of the individual to explore the test apparatus, suggesting that the task was solved by trial and error. Exploration increased with the motivation to feed and decreased with the degree of neophobia. Thus, while differences in innovation propensity between individuals may result from cognitive differences, our results highlight that they may also reflect particular motivational states or emotional responses of individuals to novel situations...|$|R
