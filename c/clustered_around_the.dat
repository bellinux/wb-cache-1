5|$|A nearby village, Niguili, {{was located}} {{near the mouth of}} Aliso Creek likely near the {{confluence}} of Aliso and Sulphur Creeks. Present-day Laguna Niguel takes its name from this settlement.

Following the Spanish arrival, most Juaneño <b>clustered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> mission in the south. Like many other once widespread Juaneño villages, Niguili was likely abandoned soon after, and there is no trace of it remaining.|$|E
5|$|Some of the city's {{earliest}} still-standing buildings {{date back}} to the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Although most are <b>clustered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Old Montreal area, such as the Sulpician Seminary adjacent to Notre Dame Basilica that dates back to 1687, and Château Ramezay, which was built in 1705, examples of early colonial architecture are dotted throughout the city. Situated in Lachine, the Le Ber-Le Moyne House is the oldest complete building in the city. In Point St. Charles visitors can see the Maison Saint-Gabriel, which can trace its history back to 1698. There are many historic buildings in Old Montreal in their original form: Notre Dame of Montreal Basilica, Bonsecours Market, and the 19th‑century headquarters of all major Canadian banks on St. James Street (French: Rue Saint Jacques). Montreal's earliest buildings are characterized by their uniquely French influence and grey stone construction.|$|E
5|$|There are 90 Grade I listed {{buildings}} in Mendip. Most are Norman- or medieval-era churches, {{many of which}} are included in the Somerset towers, a collection of distinctive, mostly spireless Gothic church towers. The greatest concentrations of Grade I listed buildings are in Wells and Glastonbury. In Wells these are <b>clustered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> 10th-century Cathedral Church of St Andrew, better known as Wells Cathedral, and the 13th-century Bishop's Palace. Glastonbury is the site of the Abbey, where construction started in the 7th century, and its associated buildings. The ruined St Michael's church, damaged in an earthquake of 1275, stands on Glastonbury Tor, where the site shows evidence of occupation from Neolithic times and the Dark Ages. The Chalice Well has been in use since Pre-Christian times. Glastonbury Abbey had a wider influence outside the town: tithe barns were built at Pilton and West Bradley to hold tithes, and a Fish House was built at Meare along with a summer residence for the Abbot (now Manor Farmhouse).|$|E
