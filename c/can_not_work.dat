25|$|Corporations {{set their}} place of {{production}} usually in areas with little to no labor regulations, {{and as a result}} low labor cost occurs. With the low labor regulations, this is where you start to see mistreatment of workers especially with women and children. Poor working conditions and sexual harassment {{are just some of the}} mistreatment faced by women in the textile supply chain. Marina Prieto-Carrón shows in her research in Central America that women in sweatshops are not even supplied with toilet paper in the bathroom everyday. The reason it costs corporations more is because people <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> to their full potential in poor conditions, affecting the global marketplace. Furthermore, when corporations decide to change manufacturing rates or locations in industries that employ more women, they are often left with no job nor assistance. This kind of sudden reduction or elimination in hours is seen in industries such as the textile industry and agriculture industry, both which employ a higher amount of women than men. One solution to mistreatment of women in the supply chain is more involvement from the corporation and trying to regulate the outsourcing of their product.|$|E

The gun boat Klas Horn headed for the Swedish coast, the gun boat Hämeenmaa headed for Vaasa and the torpedo boat S1 barely made it to Mäntyluoto outside Pori. She had only a few pieces of coal left when arriving there. S2 also tried to go to Pori, but the engines and the pumps could not function fully and the leaking worsened. It also seemed like rescue was too far away. Land was in sight and the radio operator of S2 was in contact with the radio station in Vaasa almost until the moment of disaster. The last message from the ship arrived at 1.23 pm, barely two minutes before she sank. The answer from the radio operator on S2 on the call from Vaasa was short: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> now".|$|E

It was what I thought when I stood before [...] "The Last Supper" [...] and heard men apostrophizing wonders, and beauties and perfections which had faded {{out of the picture}} and gone, a hundred years before they were born. We can imagine the beauty that was once in an aged face; we can imagine the forest if we see the stumps; but we can not absolutely see these things when they are not there. I am willing to believe that the eye of the practiced artist can rest upon the Last Supper and renew a lustre where only a hint of it is left, supply a tint that has faded away, restore an expression that is gone; patch, and color, and add, to the dull canvas until at last its figures shall stand before him aglow with the life, the feeling, the freshness, yea, with all the noble beauty that was theirs when first they came from the hand of the master.

6000|$|England {{may have}} seven {{different}} grades of productiveness in her [...] iron and coal supplies, of which her grades 1, 2, and 3 are [...] {{superior to the}} best grade of the United States, while grades 1, [...] 2, 3, and 4 in the United States may compare only with grades 4, [...] 5, 6, 7 of England. So long as England can supply herself and the [...] United States also with coal and iron from the three superior [...] grades, the United States <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> grade 1 at home. But if the [...] supply for England and the world requires grade 5 to be worked, [...] then the United States can begin the industry on her best grade, [...] although that is far inferior to the best grade in England. [...] Likewise, if the United States has three grades of wheat-land [...] superior to England’s best grade, the ability of England to grow [...] wheat depends on whether the United States can, or can not, supply [...] both herself and England from grades 1, 2, and 3. If we must [...] resort to grade 4, then England can begin to grow wheat as well as [...] we. In short, under a system of free exchange, as great a [...] diversity as under protection is probably possible, but only in [...] {{such a way that}} the best possible advantages in each particular [...] industry are employed. Smaller amounts in some branches, and [...] greater amounts in others, may be produced under a free than under [...] a restrictive system, but with all the greater gain which arises [...] from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade. The most poorly [...] endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up, but not [...] the whole industry itself. No class of persons feel the [...] competition of rivals more than English farmers since American [...] wheat has come into English markets, and yet it does not follow [...] that England can not grow a bushel of wheat. The fact is, merely, [...] that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation, and a [...] readjustment made, to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food. [...] So with us: we should not, by the free exchange, be forced to give [...] up the iron and coal industries entirely; for the best mines would [...] still keep that occupation in existence to “diversify” the others.|$|E
6000|$|These gifted Latin monks {{never do}} any thing by halves. If {{they were to}} show you the Brazen Serpent that was {{elevated}} in the wilderness, you could depend upon it that they had on hand the pole it was elevated on also, and even the hole it stood in. They have got the [...] "Grotto" [...] of the Annunciation here; and just as convenient to it as one's throat is to his mouth, they have also the Virgin's Kitchen, and even her sitting-room, where she and Joseph watched the infant Saviour play with Hebrew toys eighteen hundred years ago. All under one roof, and all clean, spacious, comfortable [...] "grottoes." [...] It seems curious that personages intimately connected with the Holy Family always lived in grottoes--in Nazareth, in Bethlehem, in imperial Ephesus--and yet nobody else in their day and generation thought of doing any thing of the kind. If they ever did, their grottoes are all gone, and I suppose we ought to wonder at the peculiar marvel of the preservation of these I speak of. When the Virgin fled from Herod's wrath, she hid in a grotto in Bethlehem, and the same is there to this day. The slaughter of the innocents in Bethlehem was done in a grotto; the Saviour was born in a grotto--both are shown to pilgrims yet. It is exceedingly strange that these tremendous events all happened in grottoes--and exceedingly fortunate, likewise, because the strongest houses must crumble to ruin in time, but a grotto in the living rock will last forever. It is an imposture--this grotto stuff--but it is one that all men ought to thank the Catholics for. Wherever they ferret out a lost locality made holy by some Scriptural event, they straightway build a massive--almost imperishable--church there, and preserve the memory of that locality for the gratification of future generations. If it had been left to Protestants to do this most worthy work, we would not even know where Jerusalem is to-day, and the man who could go and put his finger on Nazareth would be too wise for this world. The world owes the Catholics its good will even for the happy rascality of hewing out these bogus grottoes in the rock; for it is infinitely more satisfactory to look at a grotto, where people have faithfully believed for centuries that the Virgin once lived, than to have to imagine a dwelling-place for her somewhere, any where, nowhere, loose and at large all over this town of Nazareth. There is too large a scope of country. The imagination <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>work.</b> There is no one particular spot to chain your eye, rivet your interest, and make you think. The memory of the Pilgrims can not perish while Plymouth Rock remains to us. The old monks are wise. They know how to drive a stake through a pleasant tradition that will hold it to its place forever.|$|E
