500|$|Starting in 1894, Italian {{inventor}} Guglielmo Marconi began {{developing a}} wireless communication using the then newly discovered phenomenon of radio waves, showing by 1901 {{that they could}} be transmitted across the Atlantic Ocean. This was the start of wireless telegraphy by radio. Voice and music were demonstrated in 1900 and 1906, but had little success. World War I accelerated the development of radio for military communications. After the war, commercial radio [...] AM broadcasting began in the 1920s and became an important mass medium for entertainment and news. World War II again accelerated development of radio for the wartime purposes of aircraft and land communication, radio navigation and radar. Development of stereo FM broadcasting of radio took place from the 1930s on-wards in the United States and displaced AM as the dominant <b>commercial</b> <b>standard</b> by the 1960s, and by the 1970s in the United Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|As a result, O'Brien and Shelton's {{work was}} rejected. In 1958, the National Bureau of Standards invented a new sizing system, {{based on the}} {{hourglass}} figure and using only the bust size to create an arbitrary standard of sizes ranging from 8 to 38, with an indication for height (short, regular, and tall) and lower-body girth (plus or minus). The resulting <b>commercial</b> <b>standard</b> was not widely popular, and was declared voluntary in 1970 and withdrawn entirely in 1983. In 1995, ASTM International published its own voluntary standard, which has been revised since then [...] It has not been widely adopted.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{difficulty}} {{has arisen}} since {{the passing of}} the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act concerning the use of the Pharmacopoeia as a legal standard for the drugs and preparations contained in it. The Pharmacopoeia is defined in the preface as only [...] "intended to afford {{to the members of the}} medical profession and those engaged in the preparation of medicines throughout the British Empire one uniform standard and guide whereby the nature and composition of, substances to be used in medicine may be ascertained and determined". It is obvious that it cannot be an encyclopaedia of substances used in medicine, and can only be used as a standard for the substances and preparations contained in it, and for no others. It has been held in the Divisional Courts (Dickins v. Randerson) that the Pharmacopoeia is a standard for official preparations asked for under their pharmacopoeial name. But there are many substances in the Pharmacopoeia which are not only employed in medicine, but have other uses, such as sulphur, gum benzoin, tragacanth, gum arabic, ammonium carbonate, beeswax, oil of turpentine, linseed oil, and for these a <b>commercial</b> <b>standard</b> of purity as distinct from a medicinal one is needed, since the preparations used in medicine should be of the highest possible degree of purity obtainable, and this standard would be too high and too expensive for ordinary purposes. The use of trade synonyms in the Pharmacopoeia, such as saltpetre for purified potassium nitrate, and milk of sulphur for precipitated sulphur, is partly answerable for this difficulty, and has proved to be a mistake, since it affords ground for legal prosecution if a chemist sells a drug of ordinary commercial purity for trade purposes, instead of the purified preparation which is official in the Pharmacopoeia for medicinal use. This would not be the case if the trade synonym were omitted. For many drugs and chemicals not in the Pharmacopoeia there is no standard of purity that can be used under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act, and for these, as well as for the commercial quality of those drugs and essential oils which are also in the Pharmacopoeia, a legal standard of commercial purity is much needed. This subject formed the basis of discussion at several meetings of the Pharmaceutical Society, and the results have been embodied in a work called Suggested Standards for Foods and Drugs by C.G. Moor, which indicates the average degree of purity of many drugs and chemicals used in the arts, as well as the highest degree of purity obtainable in commerce of those used in medicine.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the United States Army's use of <b>commercial</b> <b>standards</b> {{in place of}} military standards (MIL-STDs) for the acquisition of Non Developmental Items (NDI). The recent acquisition of M 915 series trncks is examined. The use of <b>commercial</b> quality <b>standards</b> in place of military quality standards is discussed. In addition, the future <b>commercial</b> quality <b>standard,</b> the ISO 9000 family of standards, is looked at. The paper begins {{with a discussion of}} current and future <b>commercial</b> quality <b>standards.</b> Then the MIL-STDs used and the MIL-STDs replaced by <b>commercial</b> <b>standards</b> in the acquisition of M 915 series trucks are discussed. Benefits and concerns arising from the use of <b>commercial</b> <b>standards</b> are followed by the final chapter which contains the paper's conclusion that the use of <b>commercial</b> <b>standards</b> for Army NDI acquisitions makes sense, and recommends that the Army move toward mandating the ISO 9000 <b>commercial</b> <b>standards.</b> NANAU.
