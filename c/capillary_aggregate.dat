40|$|<b>Capillary</b> <b>aggregate</b> {{is one of}} the morphologies {{that appear}} in ternary {{mixtures}} of particles and two immiscible fluids. Capillary aggregates appear when two conditions are satisfied: the particles are fully-wetted by one of the two liquid phases, and furthermore, the wetting fluid has a volume fraction that is roughly equal to the particle volume fraction. Under these conditions, the wetting fluid creates highly compact particle aggregates called capillary aggregates. Recent research suggests that capillary aggregates can stick to one another to create a network in which capillary aggregates act as building blocks. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a macro-porous material from sintering <b>capillary</b> <b>aggregate</b> networks. In this study, morphologies of ternary mixtures in which the continuous phase is ethylene glycol, the wetting phase is light mineral oil and the solid phase is hydrophobic particles of low melting temperature polymer were studied. <b>Capillary</b> <b>aggregate</b> networks were prepared by suitable mixing methods, and then the mixtures were sintered to obtain macro-porous materials. Such macro-porous materials may be used as scaffolds for cells growth. iv This thesis reported the implementation of <b>capillary</b> <b>aggregate</b> networks and the procedures of sintering and washing process. The effects of composition of ternary mixtures on porosity, pore sizes and number of aggregates were studied. This study demonstrates that by sintering <b>capillary</b> <b>aggregate</b> networks, we can obtain high porosity materials with low particle loading, and obtain large pore sizes without using different size particles. Moreover, result shows that cells can grow well in the macro-porous materials...|$|E
40|$|Two {{patients}} with malignant histiocytosis {{were found to}} have <b>capillary</b> occlusion by <b>aggregates</b> of neoplastic histiocytes, in skeletal muscle in one, and in renal glomeruli in the other. One patient had clinical evidence of similar occlusions in the arterioles and capillaries of the ocular fundi. Occlusion of small vessels by tumour cells may explain the confusion of both patients...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a {{collection}} of experimental data, this paper analyses the interplay between dihedral angle, coordination and particle volume fraction in <b>aggregates</b> governed by <b>capillary</b> forces. Novel data are derived via a model describing the dependence of <b>capillary</b> energy on <b>aggregate</b> topological parameters. An increase in the dihedral angle above 60 degrees favours the formation of a skeleton with lower coordination. It is shown that dihedral angle also controls the conditions for the closure of pores.

40|$|The {{chloride}} {{diffusion coefficient}} {{is considered to}} be a key factor for evaluating the service life of ground-granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) blended concrete. The chloride diffusion coefficient relates to both the concrete mixing proportions and curing ages. Due to the continuous hydration of the binders, the capillary porosity of the concrete decreases and the chloride diffusion coefficient also decreases over time. To date, the dependence of chloride diffusivity on the binder hydration and curing ages of slag-blended concrete has not been considered in detail. To fill this gap, this study presents a numerical procedure to predict time-dependent chloride diffusion coefficients for slag-blended concrete. First, by using a blended cement hydration model, the degree of the binder reaction for hardening concrete can be calculated. The effects of the water to binder ratios and slag replacement ratios on the degree of the binder reaction are considered. Second, by using the degree of the binder reaction, the capillary porosity of the binder paste at different curing ages can be determined. Third, by using the <b>capillary</b> porosity and <b>aggregate</b> volume, the chloride diffusion coefficients of concrete can be calculated. The proposed numerical procedure has been verified using the experimental results of concrete with different water to binder ratios, slag replacement ratios, and curing ages...|$|R
40|$|Histological and ultrastructural {{alterations}} in capillary blood vessels were studied at various time intervals after im injection of 50 micrograms of Bothrops asper snake venom in mouse gastrocnemius muscle. Hemorrhage was observed {{as early as}} 5 min after envenomation, as abundant erythrocytes appeared in the interstitial space. Ultrastructural observations revealed two different patterns of pathological changes: {{in the majority of}} damaged capillaries, endothelial cells had blebs and cytoplasmic projections pinching off to the lumen. This phenomenon was observed together with a {{decrease in the number of}} pinocytotic vesicles, with endothelial cells becoming very thin. As an apparent consequence of this process, some endothelial cells had evident gaps in their continuity. In addition, basal laminae surrounding these capillaries were altered and discontinuous. Other endothelial cells underwent a morphologically different process of degeneration, characterized by swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum and of the cytosol. These cells had a diffuse appearance and their basal laminae were discontinuous or absent. No major changes in the intercellular junctions were noticed in damaged endothelial cells. Samples obtained 30 and 60 min after venom injection were devoid of normal capillaries in many areas, and only diffuse remnants of their structure were found. Many altered <b>capillaries</b> had platelet <b>aggregates</b> and fibrin, the latter also being observed in the interstitial space. It is concluded that B. asper venom induces rapid and drastic pathological effects on capillaries leading to hemorrhage per rhexis i. e., erythrocytes probably escape through gaps in damaged endothelial cells and not through widened intercellular junctions.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to provide}} realistic descriptions of two unique properties of the mammalian coronary microcirculation using our novel application of colored microspheres in myocardium. One important objective was to provide an innovative approach to investigate the controversial issue of whether individual coronary arteries communicate at the microvascular level, thus potentially giving rise to a zone of dual arterial supply. Simultaneous in vivo infusion of two distinctly colored microsphere suspensions into the left anterior descending (LAD; red spheres) and left circumflex (LCx; blue spheres) arteries identified a specific interface region of canine myocardium perfused by both arterial branches. Two distinct zones were delineated, and their widths measured. One region {{was defined as the}} Interface Transition Zone (ITZ). This region was formed by microvessels supplied by the individual parent arteries, and separated tissue containing only one or the other colored microspheres. The second region defined as the Boundary Watershed Zone (BWZ) was formed by <b>capillaries</b> containing sphere <b>aggregates</b> of both colors; it was located exclusively within the ITZ. In addition, the ITZ and BWZ were significantly wider in subepicardial than in subendocardial regions. Our subsequent study investigated the potential lability of the coronary watershed zones. As before, two differently colored microsphere suspensions were infused into the LAD (red spheres) and LCx (blue spheres) arteries of nine dogs. Subsequently, the LAD was ligated and a third set (green) of spheres was infused into the LCx. Capillaries perfused exclusively by the LAD before occlusion adjacent to the interface contained green microspheres as well as red/green aggregates, indicating lateral extension of the LCx perfusion territory. Results showed that occlusion caused a 24...|$|R
40|$|Ecosystems in alpine mountainous {{regions are}} {{vulnerable}} and easily disturbed by global environmental change. Alpine swamp meadow, a unique grassland {{type in the}} eastern Tibetan Plateau that provides important ecosystem services to the upstream and downstream regions of international rivers of Asia {{and other parts of}} the world, is undergoing severe degradation, which can dramatically alter soil hydraulic properties and water cycling processes. However, the effects of alpine swamp meadow degradation on soil hydraulic properties and the corresponding influencing mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, soil moisture content (SMC), field capacity (FC) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K s) together with several basic soil properties under lightly degraded (LD), moderately degraded (MD) and severely degraded (SD) alpine swamp meadow were investigated; the variations in SMC, FC and K s with alpine swamp meadow degradation and their dominant influencing factors were analysed. The results showed that SMC and FC decreased consistently from LD to SD, while K s decreased from LD to MD and then increased from MD to SD, following the order of LD [*]>[*] SD [*]>[*] MD. Significant differences in soil hydraulic properties between degradation degrees were found in the upper soil layers (0 – 20  cm), indicating that the influences of degradation were most pronounced in the topsoils. FC was positively correlated with <b>capillary</b> porosity, water-stable <b>aggregates,</b> soil organic carbon, and silt and clay content; K s was positively correlated with non-capillary porosity (NCP). Relative to other soil properties, soil porosity is the dominant factor influencing FC and K s. Capillary porosity explained 91. 1  % of total variance in FC, and NCP explained 97. 3  % of total variance in K s. The combined effect of disappearing root activities and increasing sand content was responsible for the inconsistent patterns of NCP and K s. Our findings suggest that alpine swamp meadow degradation would inevitably lead to reduced water holding capacity and rainfall infiltration. This study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the soil hydrological effects of vegetation degradation. Further hydrological modelling studies in the Tibetan Plateau and similar regions are recommended to understand the effects of degraded alpine swamp meadows on soil hydraulic properties...|$|R
