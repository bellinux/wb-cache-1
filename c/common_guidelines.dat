Each of the arrangement is different depending on the needs on the institution and the needs of each institution.

The authority for taping which law enforcement normatively has cannot be contrary to Human Rights, after all the restriction of Human Rights is matched by the nature of Criminal Law itself which to limit every individual freedom that allowed by the law. The Government and Legislatives should make an act as a <b>common</b> <b>guideline</b> which regulates tapping. So the House of Representatives and the President can outsmart and dig deeper into the importance of tapping made into an act, not into a Government Regulation. Everybody should distinguish intelligently and carefully to indicate tapping as a violation of Human Rights. The mechanism of tapping should be regulated as clearly, firmly, and directed as possible.
