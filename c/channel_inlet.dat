40|$|The {{conventional}} {{rotor spinning}} unit generates flow vortices in the transfer channel upstream region which affect the fiber configuration and consequently yarn properties. Geometry and spinning parameters such as transfer channel length, inlet width, rotor outlet pressure, opening roller speed, and diameter {{were found to}} be key parameters influencing airflow characteristics. To reduce the flow vortices in the upper stream region, modifications of the transfer channel were proposed, and their airflow fields were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. Three designs were studied: a round transfer <b>channel</b> <b>inlet,</b> a bypass channel for extra air supply, and one with both the bypass and the round inlet. Analysis of airflow revealed that the design with both round transfer <b>channel</b> <b>inlet</b> and a bypass proved to be very effective in properly directing the flow and minimizing vortices. The design was also characterized by smoother velocity streamlines and maximum mass flow across the transfer channel. A conventional rotor spinning unit was modified in which a round transfer <b>channel</b> <b>inlet</b> corner and a bypass channel were utilized to conduct the experimental tests. Three sets of yarn samples were produced using the conventional and modified rotor spinning units under different rotor speed conditions. Yarn properties were tested. Properties such as tenacity, CVm%, and thin and thick places of the spun yarns produced by the new design improved compared to that of the conventional yarn.

The effects of <b>channel</b> <b>inlet</b> port height (vertical height between <b>channel</b> <b>inlet</b> port and the block center), porosity, and block aspect ratio on the entropy generation rate due to fluid friction and heat transfer in the fluid are examined.

A uniform heat flux is considered in the block and natural convection is accommodated in the analysis. It is found that entropy generation rate due to fluid friction increases with increasing inlet port height, while this increase becomes gradual for entropy generation rate due to heat transfer for the inlet port height exceeding 0. 03 m.

40|$|AbstractMicrochannel {{heat sinks}} {{are widely used}} in {{dissipation}} of large amounts of heat from a small area. In this study, a three-dimensional numerical simulation is performed in order to investigate the flow dynamics and heat transfer characteristics in a microchannel heat sink. A unit cell containing a single microchannel of a width of 231 μm and a depth of 713 μm with surrounding solid is used for simulation. Water at 15 °C is used as the cooling liquid with Reynolds number ranging from 225 to 1450 and a constant heat flux is applied {{at the bottom of}} the heat sink. A commercial CFD code employing finite element method is used for the numerical simulation. Mesh independence test is performed for the accuracy of results. The pressure drop in the microchannel obtained from the simulation agrees well with experimental results. The highest temperature is found {{at the bottom of the}} heat sink immediately below the channel outlet and the lowest is at the <b>channel</b> <b>inlet.</b> The heat flux is high near the <b>channel</b> <b>inlet</b> due to thin thermal boundary layer in the developing region and varies around the channel periphery with lower values at the corners.
