50|$|On May 15, 1929, {{nitrocellulose}} x-ray films {{stored in}} the basement of the outpatient building ignited. An explosion sent a cloud of toxic oxides of nitrogen and carbon though the building. One hundred and twenty-three people lost their lives, including founder Dr. Phillips. A dozen investigating agencies were not able to determine what had caused the fire. <b>Cleveland</b> <b>Clinic's</b> own inquiry narrowed the possible causes down to spontaneous combustion caused by heat; a discarded cigarette or match; or contact with an extension cord light hung over a stack of films.|$|R
5|$|Favaloro became {{interested}} in developments in cardiovascular intervention, and developed an enthusiasm for thoracic surgery. During one visit to La Plata, he met Professor Mainetti, who pointed him {{in the direction of}} the <b>Cleveland</b> <b>Clinic.</b> Although in the beginning he had doubts about leaving his profession as a rural physician, he thought that he could make a greater contribution to the community on returning from the United States. With few resources and rudimentary English, he decided to travel to Cleveland. He first worked as a resident and later as a member of the surgical team, working with Donald B. Effler, head of cardiovascular surgery, F. Mason Sones, Jr., who was in charge of the Angiography Laboratory and William L. Proudfit, head of the Department of Cardiology.|$|E

50|$|Manufactured by Hansen Medical, Sensei X is a {{specialized}} robotic catheter {{system that is}} controlled by a physician and is designed for accurate positioning, manipulation and stable control of catheter and catheter-based technologies during cardiovascular procedures. The Sensei system obtained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in 2007, after which the <b>Cleveland</b> <b>Clinic's</b> electrophysiology program, then directed by Dr. Andrea Natale, received the first placement. The Sensei Robotic Catheter System and Artisan Extend Control Catheter allow physicians to navigate flexible catheters with greater stability and control during complex cardiac arrhythmia procedures. Hansen Medical has related co-development agreements with the following industry leaders: St. Jude Medical, GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthcare, and Philips Medical Systems.|$|R
50|$|Natale {{received}} his medical {{degree from the}} University of Florence Medical School, Florence, Italy and later attended the Catholic University School of Cardiology, Rome, Italy.

Prior to his appointment as Executive Medical Director of the Texas Cardiovascular Arrhythmia Institute at St. David’s Medical Center in Austin, Natale was faculty at Duke University, then Director of the Electrophysiology Section of the University of Kentucky in Lexington and Section Head for the Department of Cardiac Pacing and Electrophysiology and Medical Director for the <b>Cleveland</b> <b>Clinic’s</b> Center for Atrial Fibrillation.|$|R
50|$|The BioMEMS and Renal Nanotechnology Laboratories at the <b>Cleveland</b> <b>Clinic's</b> Lerner Research Institute {{have focused}} on {{advancing}} membrane technology to develop an implantable or wearable therapy for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Current dialysis cartridges are too large and require superphysiologic pressures for blood circulation, and pores in current polymer membranes have too broad of a size distribution and irregular features. Manufacturing a silicon, nanoporous membrane with narrow pore size distributions improves the membrane's ability to discriminate between filtered and retained molecules. It also increases hydraulic permeability by allowing the mean pore size to approach the desired cutoff of the membrane. Using a batch-fabrication process allows for strict control over pore size distribution and geometry.|$|R

[...] Dr. Bernick speculates that the cumulative damage over time from lesser blows may eventually prove an even more important topic of study than that of infrequent concussions.|$|R
