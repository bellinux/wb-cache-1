50|$|The {{city and}} its {{surroundings}} were gravely impacted by the 1991-95 Croatian War of Independence. The city {{was close to the}} front lines between the forces of Croatia and the rebel Serbs, but it managed to avoid the fate of nearby Vukovar, which was besieged in the infamous Battle of Vukovar. The eastern sections of the town were substantially damaged by shelling, and the nearby village of <b>Cerić</b> <b>was</b> almost completely destroyed. The most significant destruction in the town center were the town library, which burned down to the ground, the town court, the Catholic and Orthodox churches (the Church of Saints Eusebius and Polion and the Church of Pentecost, respectively), both of its hospitals, the town theatre, two cinemas, and a host of businesses and factories. The Church of Pentecost was dynamited by local Croatian forces as retaliation after rebel Serbs forces severely damaged the local Catholic rectory. In December 1995-96, the Vinkovci rail station served as a rail offloading base for the United States Army's 1st Armored Division en route to Županja to cross the Sava River into Bosnia during Operation Joint Endeavor.|$|R
2500|$|The Belousov–Zhabotinsky {{reaction}} is a spatio-temporal chemical oscillator {{that can be}} simulated {{by means of a}} cellular automaton. In the 1950s A. M.

Generally, I avoid trying to influence the readers as {{to the importance of}} the content of this publication as I rely on the intelligence and goodwill of the readers. In this issue, I am making an exception. Often I have heard friends in the USA and abroad complaining that so-called moderate Muslims do not publically condemn Islamist terrorism and do not provide alternative voices to the militants. From my extensive contacts with Muslims, I know this not to be true. What I did discover is that the authentic voice of the majority views of Muslims is often not afforded publicity in our media, press, and publications. In the writings of Dr. Mustafa Cerić, the Grand Mufti emeritus of Bosnia and Herzegovina, our readers will encounter a powerful voice directed both to Muslims and non-Muslims appealing for an effective coexistence and cooperation. The article, “Invitation: Declaration of European Muslims,” though originally written in 2006, seems as relevant in 2017 as it was when it was written and deserves wide dissemination. The article was recently published in an unusual multi-language book in Sarajevo which I also reviewed in this issue. My hope is that our readers around the world will read it carefully as <b>Cerić</b> <b>is</b> a prominent representative of a multitude of Muslim voices around the world who have not yet received due attention. In these tense times, it is important for those who believe in the possibility of forgiveness, reconciliation, and peaceful cooperation across various human barriers to respond to the former Grand Mufti of Bosnia, Dr. Mustafa Cerić and build good-will on this solid foundation.

40|$|All {{reactions}} are accelerated {{by an increase}} in temperature, but the magnitude of that effect on very slow reactions {{does not seem to have}} been fully appreciated. The hydrolysis of polysaccharides, for example, is accelerated 190, 000 -fold when the temperature is raised from 25 to 100 [*]°C, while the rate of hydrolysis of phosphate monoester dianions increases 10, 300, 000 -fold. Moreover, the slowest reactions tend to be the most heat-sensitive. These tendencies collapse, by as many as five orders of magnitude, the time that would have been required for early chemical evolution in a warm environment. We propose, further, that if the catalytic effect of a “proto-enzyme”—like that of modern enzymes—were mainly enthalpic, then the resulting rate enhancement would have increased automatically as the environment became cooler. Several powerful nonenzymatic catalysts of very slow biological reactions, notably pyridoxal phosphate and the <b>ceric</b> ion, <b>are</b> shown to meet that criterion. Taken together, these findings greatly reduce the time that would have been required for early chemical evolution, countering the view that not enough time has passed for life to have evolved to its present level of complexity...|$|R
