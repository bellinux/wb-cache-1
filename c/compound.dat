5|$|If the ionic <b>compound</b> is soluble in a solvent, {{it can be}} {{obtained}} as a solid <b>compound</b> by evaporating the solvent from this electrolyte solution. As the solvent is evaporated, the ions do not go into the vapour, but stay in the remaining solution, and when they become sufficiently concentrated, nucleation occurs, and they crystallize into an ionic <b>compound.</b> This process occurs widely in nature, and is the means of formation of the evaporite minerals.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} system of <b>compounding</b> attested in the {{earliest}} written Latvian texts of the 16 th and 17 th centuries. The philological analysis presented in this work is the first systematic attempt to extensively treat <b>compounds</b> in Old Latvian. The purpose of this thesis is to thoroughly describe {{the system of}} <b>compounding</b> of the earliest period of written Latvian. One of the main aims of the analysis provided in this work is {{to determine whether the}} Old Latvian <b>compounds</b> were distinguished in terms of their meaning and form. This is why another important aim {{of this study is to}} discern the most characteristic formal properties of each category of <b>compounds</b> in Old Latvian. This study also addresses the morphological variation of the components of <b>compounds</b> and seeks to explain why one finds different tendencies of <b>compounding</b> in the texts of this period.     Firstly, it is shown in this thesis that <b>compounds</b> in Old Latvian were clearly distinguished in terms of their meaning. The main semantic types of Old Latvian <b>compounds,</b> which were analyzed in this study, are the determinative <b>compounds,</b> the possessive <b>compounds,</b> the verbal governing <b>compounds,</b> and the copulative <b>compounds.</b> Secondly, it is argued that the aforementioned types of <b>compounds</b> were clearly differentiated in terms of the formal properties of their components. A large number of possessive <b>compounds</b> and verbal governing <b>compounds</b> had the compositional suffix -is (m.) /-e (f.). By contrast, only a handful of determinative <b>compounds</b> had this suffix. In view of the distribution of the suffix found in the Old Latvian <b>compounds,</b> it is suggested that the suffix was originally restricted to adjectival <b>compounds.</b> Furthermore, the different types of <b>compounds</b> in Old Latvian were also distinguished in terms of the first component. In the majority of cases, both the possessive <b>compounds</b> and the verbal governing <b>compounds</b> were coined without linking elements, while the determinative <b>compounds</b> had linking elements to a larger extent. Thirdly, it is proposed in this thesis that a part of linking elements used in the determinative <b>compounds</b> in Old Latvian originated from the original stem vowels of the first components. Thus, it is argued that stem <b>compounds</b> were still attested in the Old Latvian texts, although this Baltic model of coining <b>compounds</b> is no longer visible in Modern Latvian. Lastly, it is suggested that the tendencies of <b>compounding</b> found in the texts under discussion represent dialectal differences. Another contribution of this study is that the Old Latvian <b>compounds</b> are not treated in isolation, but analyzed in drawing parallels with <b>compounds</b> in the other Baltic languages, Lithuanian in particular. Hence, by analyzing common features and similarities between the <b>compounding</b> systems, the Old Latvian <b>compounds</b> are positioned within the context of the Baltic system of <b>compounding.</b> ...|$|R
