40|$|In {{this work}} {{the effect of}} a {{biological}} exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> on the emission of microorganisms and endotoxins was investigated. The exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> was originally developed to reduce ammonia- and odour emissions. It was a combination of a bioscrubber and a chemofilter. The washing water circulated within facility. In order to determine the effect of the exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> on the bioaerosol emission from the duck-fattening unit, the concentrations of dust, airborne aerobic bacteria, airborne aerobic gram-negative bacteria, inspirable endotoxin and moulds were measured before and after the washing process. Furthermore, the concentrations of bacteria, endotoxins and moulds in the washing water and the composition of gram-negative bacterial and mould flora in the air and the washing water were determined. In all 22 cases the investigated exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> decreased the emission of dust, airborne aerobic bacteria and endotoxins. In some cases the concentrations of airborne aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7 out of 22) and moulds (6 out of 22) were increased. In addition to this, the quality of the washing water had an influence on the air composition by forming a secondary aerosol. The predominant bacterial family in the air in front of the exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> were Enterobacteriaceae, whereas the <b>air</b> after the <b>washer</b> contained mainly Pseudomonadaceae. In order to express the quantitative effect of the exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> a reduction factor was applied. In average the dust concentration was reduced by a factor of 3. 0, the aerobic bacteria by a factor of 6. 1 and the endotoxin concentration by a factor of 12. 5. The airborne aerobic gram-negative bacteria were reduced in average by a factor of 1. 9, however, in 7 out of 22 cases it was increased by a factor of 14. 8 maximum. The concentrations of airborne moulds were decreased in average by a factor of 2. 3. In 6 out of 22 cases it increased by a factor of 3. 8 maximum. Future investigation should show whether another filter stage or a treatment of the washing water to minimize the germs (disinfection) can increase the purification efficiency of the exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer...</b>|$|R

40|$|In nylon {{finishing}} a final step is a thermal treatment to fix auxiliary chemicals to fibers, to remove volatile compounds and monomers and to relax the textile structure. For this purpose stenters with natural gas burners are applied. The hot exhaust air contains monomers, solvents, lubricants and specific textile auxiliary chemicals {{that have to}} be removed with large amounts of fresh or process water by exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washers.</b> To reduce water costs, process-integrated water treatment and recycling processes are demanded. Annular photoreactors with low and middle-pressure mercury arc lamps and a solar non concentrating tubular receiver reactor have been applied to examine the treatment of exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> liquor and its components in the laboratory and up to semi-technical scale. The application of sole UV radiation, the combination of UV radiation with oxidants, semiconductor photocatalysts and the light enhanced Fenton reaction were compared. The photo Fenton conditions were optimized in respect of throughput and hydrogen peroxide consumption. The degradation pathway of epsilon-caprolactam (the main constituent of the <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> liquor) was analyzed by ion chromatography and HPLC-MS. The overall degradation was controlled by total organic carbon analysis. Intermediates like epsilon-amino capronic acid, N-hydroxy-epsilon-caprolactam, epsilon-nitroso capronic acid have been confirmed as initial intermediates also like acetate, oxalate and formiate as intermediates before complete mineralization. In comparison to photolytic hydrogen peroxide oxidation, light enhanced Fenton turned out to be much faster and to consume lower amounts of hydrogen peroxide. It could be demonstrated that the iron catalyst can be recycled with minor activity losses with middle-pressure mercury arc lamps. Photochemically enhanced Fenton reaction has proved to be most effective with respect to the consumption of time, energy and chemicals for the application in exhaust air treatment of nylon finishing. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} etching {{methods to}} polish surfaces of cut glass have caused hereditary discharges into air (Fluorine), into waste water {{and due to}} sludge disposals {{as a result of}} the chemical sewage treatment process. The goal of this project was to find a new chemical polishing method (single bath method) for traditional glass cutting by reducing the environmental burdens. During the research work an etching method for crystal glass and for lead crystal glass was developed, tested and partially transferred into production. Furthermore the basis for a computer controlled process automation has been worked out. In addition to this a new process water treatment system has been conceived, which substantially reduces about 40 % burdens of the treated waste water (ready for discharge into the sewage systems). A pilot plant of 'crystal glass' is already working; the pilot plant for lead crystal glass is under construction and will be available in 6 months.

40|$|The avian lung has {{a highly}} {{sophisticated}} morphology with a complex vascular system. Extant data regarding avian pulmonary angioarchitecture {{are few and}} contradictory. We used corrosion casting techniques, light microscopy, as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy to study the development, topography, and distribution of the parabronchial vasculature in the chicken lung. The arterial system was divisible into three hierarchical generations, all formed external to the parabronchial capillary meshwork. These included the interparabronchial arteries (A 1) that ran parallel to the long axes of parabronchi and gave rise to orthogonal parabronchial arteries (A 2) that formed arterioles (A 3). The arterioles formed capillaries that participated {{in the formation of}} the parabronchial mantle. The venous system comprised six hierarchical generations originating from the luminal aspect of the parabronchi, where capillaries converged to form occasional tiny infundibular venules (V 6) around infundibulae, or septal venules (V 5) between conterminous atria. The confluence of the latter venules formed atrial veins (V 4), which gave rise to intraparabronchial veins (V 3) that traversed the capillary meshwork to join the interparabronchial veins (V 1) directly or via parabronchial veins (V 2). The primitive networks inaugurated through sprouting, migration, and fusion of vessels and the basic vascular pattern was already established by the 20 th embryonic day, with the arterial system preceding the venous system. Segregation and remodeling of the fine vascular entities occurred through intussusceptive angiogenesis, a process that probably progressed well into the posthatch period. Apposition of endothelial cells to the attenuating epithelial cells of the <b>air</b> <b>capillaries</b> resulted in establishment of the thin blood-gas barrier. Fusion of blood capillaries proceeded through apposition of the anastomosing sprouts, with subsequent thinning of the abutting boundaries and ultimate communication of the lumens.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the extreme {{thinness}} of the avian pulmonary blood-gas barrier (PBGB), it is remarkably strong. To understand {{the basis of the}} remarkable strength of the avian PBGB, network of collagen connective tissue that form the lung’s parabronchial fibrous framework and type-IV collagen, a principal component of the basement membrane was investigated in the BGB and in the epithelial-epithelial contacts between the <b>air</b> <b>capillaries</b> in the domestic fowl, Gallus gallus variant domesticus. Techniques of discriminatory staining, selective alkali digestion, vascular casting followed by alkali digestion and immunoelectron microscopy were used. Abundant collagen fibers of the interparabronchial septa, which form part of the tunica adventitia of the interparbronchial vessels, firmly interconnect adjacent parabronchi directly and indirectly (via intraparabronchial vessels). Peripherally, the intraparabronchial artery, with its tunic of collagen fibers, enters and penetrates the exchange tissue mantle. The collagen fibers around the vessel decrease in quantity as it divides into blood capillaries. From the luminal side, the projection of the parabronchial lumen into the exchange tissue mantle as the atria, the infundibulae and the <b>air</b> <b>capillaries,</b> in this order, carry collagen covering which reduces in quantity with each division. The three-dimensional interactions between blood capillaries from the peripheral part and <b>air</b> <b>capillaries</b> from the central lumen allow contact formation between blood <b>capillaries,</b> <b>air</b> <b>capillaries</b> and between air- and blood capillaries. Collagen fiber continuum starting from the interparabronchial septa runs through the exchange tissue by following the three contacts sites and terminates at the parabronchial lumen. At the periphery, the collagen fibers constitute a conspicuous bundle. Within the exchange tissue mantle, the collagen forms diffuse complex interconnections of thin fibers. Towards the parabronchial lumen and within interatrial septa, the thinner collagen fibers of the exchange tissue mantle aggregate to form thick bundles which bind to the connective tissues surrounding the parabronchial muscles. Based on the structural arrangements and function of the smooth muscle, the collagen- and the elastic tissue fibers, and structures like the interparabronchial septa and their associated blood vessels, it was envisaged that: dynamic- tension and compressive forces exist in a parabronchus to form a tensegrity (tension integrity) system. The tensegrity arrangement imparts rigidity to a parabronchus while strengthening the air and the blood capillaries. Mechanical interdependence between parabronchi and between air- and blood capillaries allows efficient transmission and redistribution of tension. The tortuous course of the collagen fiber continuum that follows the three-dimensional intertwining of the gas exchange units- from septa to the lumen- ensures that tension does not travel a straight course and as such, any extrinsic or intrinsic force applied to the structure is transmitted away from the point of origin. Graded exercise intensities and perfusion at different pressures on the integrity of the BGB were used to determine the condition under which the blood-gas barrier in the avian lungs fails. Number of red blood cells and protein concentration in the harvested lung lavage fluid were estimated in the exercised chickens. For histological analysis, numbers of epithelial-epithelial (E-E) breaks and blood-gas barrier (BGB) breaks were counted {{in each of the four}} vascular regions of the lung in both the exercised and the perfused lungs. Post exercise blood lactate analysis showed a 4 -fold increase between rest and maximal exercise (2. 95 m/s) while the numbers of red blood cells and protein concentration increased steadily with increasing exercise intensity, however, the degree of increments appeared to decrease at higher workloads. The two kinds of breaks occurred at all levels of exercise and in the resting birds but at any exercise intensity, there were more E-E breaks than BGB breaks. The numbers of breaks increased with increasing exercise intensity and the difference between the two types of breaks decreased with increasing exercise intensity. In resting birds, there were no breaks in the area of the lung supplied by the cranial branch of the PA. In the exercised birds, differences in number of blood-gas barrier breaks among the four vascular territories only occurred at 0. 66 m/s where the lowest and highest counts occurred in the cranial- and caudomedial regions respectively, whereas at all other levels of exercise, the numbers of breaks were comparable. Presence of red blood cells in the lungs of resting birds indicated that failure of the blood-gas barrier might be a common but inconsequential event in the avian lung. A positive linear relationship exists between the perfusion pressure and the numbers of both E-E and blood-gas barrier breaks. At all perfusion pressures, there are more E-E breaks than BGB breaks. The difference between the two types of breaks decreased with increasing pressure. At any perfusion pressure, more breaks occurred in the regions supplied by the accessory- and caudomedial branches of the PA than in the regions supplied by the cranial- and the caudomedial ones. This could be because the pressures in the two blood vessels may be higher since the caudomedial branch is the most direct continuation of the PA while the accessory branch is the narrowest and the first to originate from the PA. Because of the extreme thinness of the blood-gas barrier and unavoidable puncturing of air sac when the thorax is accessed to cannulate the pulmonary vessels, the exact pressure at which the BGB fails could not be ascertained since both types of failure occurred at all perfusion pressures. However, separation of the epithelial-epithelial contacts, caused by distension of the blood capillaries, started appearing at the perfusion pressure of 2. 89 kPa. This may represent the pressure at which the blood-gas barrier starts to fail...|$|R

40|$|As {{birds have}} tubular lungs {{that do not}} contain alveoli, avian {{surfactant}} predominantly functions to maintain airflow in tubes rather than to prevent alveolar collapse. Consequently, we have evaluated structural, biochemical, and functional parameters of avian surfactant {{as a model for}} airway surfactant in the mammalian lung. Surfactant was isolated from duck, chicken, and pig lung lavage fluid by differential centrifugation. Electron microscopy revealed a uniform surfactant layer within the <b>air</b> <b>capillaries</b> of the bird lungs, and there was no tubular myelin in purified avian surfactants. Phosphatidylcholine molecular species of the various surfactants were measured by HPLC. Compared with pig surfactant, both bird surfactants were enriched in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, the principle surface tension-lowering agent in surfactant, and depleted in palmitoylmyristoylphosphatidylcholine, the other disaturated phosphatidylcholine of mammalian surfactant. Surfactant protein (SP) -A was determined by immunoblot analysis, and SP-B and SP-C were determined by gel-filtration HPLC. Neither SP-A nor SP-C was detectable in either bird surfactant, but both preparations of surfactant contained SP-B. Surface tension function was determined using both the pulsating bubble surfactometer (PBS) and capillary surfactometer (CS). Under dynamic cycling conditions, where pig surfactant readily reached minimal surface tension values below 5 mN/m, neither avian surfactant reached values below 15 mN/m within 10 pulsations. However, maximal surface tension of avian surfactant was lower than that of porcine surfactant, and all surfactants were equally efficient in the CS. We conclude that a surfactant composed primarily of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and SP-B is adequate to maintain patency of the <b>air</b> <b>capillaries</b> of the bird lung...|$|R
40|$|Real-time demand {{response}} {{is an essential}} tool for handling the uncertainties associated with the increasing penetration of renewable generation. Traditionally, {{demand response}} {{has been focused on}} large industrial and commercial loads, however it is expected {{that a large number of}} small residential loads such as <b>air</b> conditioners, dish <b>washers,</b> and electric vehicles will also participate in the coming years. The electricity consumption of these smaller loads, which we call deferrable loads, can be shifted over time, and can thus be used (in aggregate) to compensate for the random fluctuations in renewable generation. In this paper, we propose a real-time distributed deferrable load control algorithm to reduce the variance of aggregate load (load minus renewable generation) by shifting the power consumption of deferrable loads to periods with high renewable generation. At every time step, the algorithm minimizes the expected aggregate load variance with updated predictions. We prove that the suboptimality of the algorithm vanishes quickly as time horizon expands. Further, we evaluate the algorithm via trace-based simulations...|$|R
40|$|A simple imaging setup {{based on}} the {{principle}} of coherence-based contrast X-ray imaging with unmonochromatized synchrotron radiation was used for studying mammographic phantom and human breast specimens. The use of unmonochromatized synchrotron radiation simplifies the instrumentation, decreases the cost and makes the procedure simpler and potentially more suitable for clinical applications. The imaging systems consisted of changeable silicon wafer attenuators, a tungsten slit system, a CdWO 4 scintillator screen, a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) camera coupled to optical magnification lenses, and a personal computer. In preliminary studies, a spatial resolution test pattern and glass <b>capillary</b> filled with <b>air</b> bubbles were imaged to evaluate the resOolution characteristics and coherence-based contrast enhancement. Both the spatial resolution and image quality of the proposed syste...|$|R
