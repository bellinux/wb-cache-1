Existing <b>charge</b> <b>drive</b> circuits cannot be directly applied to bimorph benders since they share a common electrode. In this article a new <b>charge</b> <b>drive</b> circuit and electrical configura-tion is implemented that allows commonly available piezoelec-tric bimorphs to be linearized. This circuit consists of four major components, including, a high voltage amplifier, a differential amplifier, a piezoelectric load and a PI feedback controller. An isolation amplifier was used to achieve a differential amplifier with a high common-mode rejection ratio. The <b>charge</b> <b>drive</b> was tested by driving a series poled, three layer bimorph bender. The experiment showed a significant improvement to the hysteresis of the bender when compared to a typical voltage drive. This work has identified an alternative Feedback method to improve the AC hysteresis performance of a piezoelectric bender by using a <b>charge</b> <b>drive.</b> I...|$|E

40|$|In the {{construction}} of high intensity accelerators, it is the utmost goal to minimize the beam loss by avoiding or minimizing contributions of various halo formation mechanisms. As a halo formation mechanism, space <b>charge</b> <b>driven</b> resonances are well known for circular accelerators. However, the recent finding showed that even in linear accelerators the space charge potential can excite the 4 σ= 360 ° fourth order resonance [D. Jeon et al., Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams 12, 054204 (2009) ]. This study increased the interests in space <b>charge</b> <b>driven</b> resonances of linear accelerators. Experimental studies of the space <b>charge</b> <b>driven</b> resonances of high intensity linear accelerators are rare {{as opposed to the}} multitude of simulation studies. This paper presents an experimental evidence of the space <b>charge</b> <b>driven</b> 4 σ= 360 ° resonance and the 2 σ_{x(y) }− 2 σ_{z}= 0 resonance of a high intensity linear accelerator through beam profile measurements from multiple wire-scanners.

The parallel plate actuator is first introduced as case study. Then, a one degree-of freedom model is obtained for microplate electromechanics. The parasitic capacitance arising from the non-uniform device deformation is evaluated. This practically leads to a reduced capacitance feedback with respect to parallel plate systems. Consequently, a limited stabilizing effect of <b>charge</b> <b>drive</b> can be obtained.

40|$|Abstract: Piezoelectric {{actuators}} {{are known}} to exhibit hysteresis when driven at relatively large voltages. In most situations this phenomenon is detrimental. Electric charge is known to naturally reduce the effects of hysteresis. The interaction of <b>charge</b> <b>driven</b> piezoceramics with flexible structures is analyzed and reveals that {{the dynamics of the}} system are different from the voltage driven case. A procedure for obtaining a <b>charge</b> <b>driven</b> plant model is documented, which can be used with standard control design tools. A multivariable LQG charge controller is designed to reject disturbance vibrations acting on a cantilever beam. Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of this method are included.

40|$|Due to {{hysteresis}} {{exhibited by}} piezoelectric actuators, positioning stages in scanning probe microscopes require sensor-based closed-loop control. Although closed-loop control is effective at eliminating non-linearity at scan speeds below 10 Hz, it also severely limits bandwidth and contributes sensor-induced noise. The need for high-gain feedback is reduced or eliminated if the piezoelectric actuators are driven with charge rather than voltage. Charge drives can reduce hysteresis {{to less than}} 1 % of the scan range. This results in a corresponding increase in bandwidth and reduction of sensor induced noise. In this work we review the design of charge drives and compare them to voltage amplifiers for driving lateral SPM scanners.

40|$|Due to {{hysteresis}} {{exhibited by}} piezoelectric actuators, positioning stages in scanning probe microscopes require sensor-based closed-loop control. Although closed-loop control is effective at eliminating non-linearity at low scan speeds, the bandwidth compared to open loop is severely reduced. In addition, sensor noise significantly degrades achievable resolution in closed loop. In this work, charge drives are evaluated {{as a simple}} positioning alternative when feedback control cannot be applied or provides inadequate performance. These situations arise in high-speed imaging, where position sensor noise can be large or where no feedback sensors are present. Charge drives can reduce the error caused by hysteresis to less than 1 % of the scan range.

40|$|Topological defects {{are crucial}} to the {{thermodynamics}} and structure of condensed matter systems. For instance, when incorporated into crystalline membranes like graphene, disclinations with positive and negative topological <b>charge</b> <b>drive</b> the elastic energy ground state shapes into conical- and saddle-like geometries, respectively. A recently uncovered mapping between the inter-element spacing in 2 D columnar structures and the metric properties of curved surfaces motivates basic questions about the interplay between defects in the cross section of a columnar bundle and its 3 D shape. Such questions are critical {{to the structure of}} a broad class of filamentous materials, from biological assemblies like protein fibers to nano- or micro-structured synthetic materials like carbon nanotube bundles. Here, we explore the shape response to elementary disclinations (5 - and 7 -fold defects) in hexagonal bundles using a combination of continuum elasticity theory and numerical simulation of discrete-filaments. We show that shape instabilities are controlled by a single material-dependent parameter that characterizes the ratio of inter-filament to intra-filament elastic energies. Along with a host of previously unknown shape equilibria [...] -the filamentous analogs to the conical and saddles shapes of defective membranes [...] -we find a profoundly asymmetric response to positive and negative topologically charged defects in the infinite length limit that is without parallel to the membrane analog. The highly non-linear dependence on the sign of the topological disclination charge is shown to have a purely geometric origin, stemming the from the distinct compatibility (incompatibility) of effectively positive- (negative-) curvature geometries with longitudinally constant filament spacing.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{describes}} the design, manufacture {{and testing of}} a small scale autonomous robot, as well as methods for driving piezoelectric benders {{that can be used}} in miniature robotics. This research creates a foundation for a new range of miniature robots that can be used across a wide range of applications, such as remote sensing in dangerous conditions, assembly or maintenance in larger machines or devices, in-vitro administration of medical aid, search and rescue and agricultural robots for pollination and pest control. Piezoelectric actuators have a high stiffness, resolution and fast response compared to other actuators, however they can generally only achieve very small strains. A bimorph bender is a type of piezoelectric actuator that features two piezoelectric elements joined together as a beam and when driven with a voltage will produce a bending motion. The idea of using piezoelectric benders in miniature robotics is a relatively new one and ways of improving the driving and operation of these benders are explored. A new method for driving a bimorph bender was developed that utilises both the polling, and coercive electric field strengths to provide a 38 % improvement in deflection over previous methods. A <b>charge</b> <b>drive</b> for a piezoelectric bimorph was also developed that reduced the hysteresis non-linearity by 92 %. An integral part of any miniature robot is the locomotion mechanism. A two degree of freedom miniature robotic leg that utilises piezoelectric bimorph actuators was designed and then tested. This leg measured approximately 15 mm x 15 mm x 15 mm and is intended to be used in a hexapod style robot driven at resonance. An analytical model was derived using three independent lumped mass models and superposition. This model can be used to tune the first two resonance modes such that they overlap by altering the size and shape of the flexure and end-effector. By driving the leg at this resonance an ambulatory motion is produced. This analytical model was then verified using FEA and experimentally...|$|E
