50|$|The Ecodesign Directive is a {{framework}} directive, {{meaning that it}} does not directly set minimum ecological requirements. These are adopted through specific implementing measures for each group of products in the scope of the Directive. The implementing measures are adopted through the so-called <b>comitology</b> <b>procedure.</b> Implementing measures are based on EU internal market rules governing which products may be placed on the market. Manufacturers who begin marketing an energy using product covered by an implementing measure in the EU area have to ensure that it conforms to the energy and environmental standards set out by the measure.|$|E
50|$|To {{ensure that}} the spatial data {{infrastructures}} of the member states are compatible and usable in a community and transboundary context, the INSPIRE Directive requires that additional legislation or common Implementing Rules (IR) are adopted {{for a number of}} specific areas (metadata, interoperability of spatial data sets and services, network services, data and service sharing and monitoring and reporting). These are published either as Commission Regulations or as Decisions. The Commission is assisted in the process of adopting such rules by a regulatory committee, INSPIRE Committee, composed of representatives of the member states and chaired by a representative of the Commission (this is known as the <b>Comitology</b> <b>procedure).</b>|$|E
30|$|However, the Commission {{plans to}} revise the annexes only and not the main text of the regulation. The Commission justifies this {{approach}} {{by being able to}} use the faster and lighter <b>comitology</b> <b>procedure</b> and by avoiding to re-open the general REACH discussion. This approach was supported by a majority of Member States, at least as a first step. In our view one reason for the Commission to choose the <b>comitology</b> <b>procedure</b> is that the Commission has a stronger position than during the ordinary legislative procedure.|$|E
40|$|The <b>comitology</b> <b>procedures</b> {{have been}} an {{integral}} part of the European Union legislative decision-making process. The negotiation of the legal framework of the <b>comitology</b> <b>procedures,</b> as well as the administrative practice of the European Commission in drafting implementing acts, is relevant to the legal research on the evolution of European integration. This article studies the dynamic relationship between the process of regulation and implementation of <b>comitology</b> <b>procedures,</b> and the process of parliamentarisation of the European Communities and later of the European Union. Two hypotheses are tested. The first hypothesis claims that there is a clear causal link between the use of newly acquired budgetary and legislative powers of the European Parliament, and the limitation of control by Member States on the Commission by the comitology committees. The second hypothesis claims that a weak system interaction exists between the notion of parliamentarisation and the reform of the comitology system...|$|R

40|$|The Lisbon Treaty reform {{provided}} an important {{innovation in the}} EU regulatory activity by differentiating between the legislative delegation (art. 290 TFEU) and the executive delegation (art. 291 TFEU). In so doing, {{the central role of}} the European Commission in the <b>Comitology</b> <b>procedures</b> as well as the power of the European Parliament and the Council to control its executive powers have been modified. The new 2011 Comitology Regulation aimed at creating a more intelligible and transparent committees' system where the EC is expected to act in a stricter framework. The paper argues that the new Regulation preserves the efficiency of the Comitology system; at the same time, however, it does not really improve the level of transparency and clarity {{in the way in which}} the committees' procedures works. Moreover, as the practice clearly shows, the EC continues to enjoy a broad discretion in the adoption of implementing acts...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{questions to be}} addressed by this subproject should contribute to a constructive solution to this important issue of the institutional balance by first establishing criteria for an operational demarcation between legislative and implementing measures, and secondly by assessing a large number of EC implementing acts to determine whether and in which cases implementing measures have in fact violated the prerogatives of the legislators Council and Parliament. The subproject therefore concentrates on the following questions, divided into a theoretical and an empirical approach: How can the line that separates implementing measures from those with legislative implications be drawn? How can that differentiation between legislative and implementing legal acts be made operational? How could an effective system of control be established that limits the implementing powers of the Commission and safeguards the prerogatives of the legislators, especially Parliament? Have the prerogatives of the legislative authorities been generally respected in implementing decisions {{in the course of the}} past years or have decisions with important legislative implications been decided upon according to <b>comitology</b> <b>procedures?</b> In which policy arenas has this primarily occurred? In what way have these possible "transgressions" affected the institutional balance...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{importance}} of comitology in the EU law-making process. The main reason for choosing this topic was the {{need to consider the}} importance of comitology in the EU decision-making process from a legal perspective. Until now the importance of comitology has been largely viewed through the lens of political science. Given that comitology is connected to the implementing phase of the EU law-making process, {{it was not possible to}} ignore the issue of implementing powers and, on the contrary, it was proper to study the comitology in this context. I addressed comitology as a multi-faceted phenomenon, with historical, institutional, substantive and procedural dimensions. I studied these elements also in their mutual interaction. Considering comitology as a complex issue was a necessary precondition to achieving objectives I set in the thesis. Given the absence of specialized literature capturing recent legal developments, I had to rely largely on primary sources. The main objective of my thesis was to clarify if and to what extent the current shape and functioning of comitology complies with the principle legal certainty and respects the limits of implementing powers. I also focused on the associated question of the judicial review of legal acts adopted by <b>comitology</b> <b>procedures</b> [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Some 300 {{legislative}} acts are adopted every {{year by the}} European Parliament and the Council, or by the Council alone. Based on these acts, the European Commission adopts around 3, 000 implementing acts each year, after consulting one of the 250 so-called ‘Comitology committees’ made up of representatives of the Member States. Only about 0. 2 % of these delegated acts are referred back to the Council because of non-agreement between the Commission and the Committee. Since the entry into force of the second Comitology decision in 1999, Parliament also has a right of scrutiny over such acts, but it has used this right in order to question the Commission’s proposals in only three cases. This paper asks whether this right of scrutiny is an appropriate way of controlling delegated rule-making. It starts with a short historical overview of Parliament’s role, before describing the current legal regulation of Parliament’s involvement in <b>comitology</b> <b>procedures.</b> It then looks in detail at the three cases in which Parliament has to date adopted a ‘Resolution’. Finally, a general assessment is made of parliamentarian control over implementing powers, {{with a view to}} contributing to the present discussion about an adequate system of delegated rule-making under the Constitutional Treaty...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the current Consumer Credit Directive 87 / 102 /EC in 1986, the EU consumer credit market has changed significantly in terms of size and structure. Although amendments were introduced in 1990 and 1999, the Directive no longer addresses the needs of the market. Cross-border lending in the EU has been estimated to be only 2 to 5 % of total EU lending, partly owing to variations in the applicable legislation across member states. The reason for the persistent legal differences is that the current regulatory model is based on a minimum harmonisation approach (together with the rules of Art. 5 of the Rome Convention) and national regulators have different views about consumer protection. To move towards greater consistency, the Commission sought to change the regulatory approach from minimum to total harmonisation in its proposed new Consumer Credit Directive. Yet this regulatory method presents several difficulties. The EU legislative process is too long and rigid for a fast-changing market. Further, member states do not wish to lose regulatory powers on issues that may need rapid adaptations to meet social or economic needs. This paper argues that one way forward is to draw from the experience of the strategies used to achieve integration of EU financial markets and adapt it to the field of consumer credit. A variation of the Lamfalussy approach, in which <b>comitology</b> <b>procedures</b> are used in the legislative process, would radically improve the regulatory process for consumer credit. By involving the member states to a greater extent and allowing for quick adaptations, such an approach would ultimately lead to a greater level of market integration...|$|R
40|$|From the Introduction]. Each EU {{member state}} {{has its own}} EU policy {{coordination}} system. This system is decisive for its European “viability” with regard to EU policies and decision-making procedures. This viability is its general capacity to properly fulfill all Member State obligations arising from acquis and adequately address all problems arising {{during the process of}} acquis formulation (i. e. during the negotiation phase of its formation in the Council or in the <b>comitology</b> <b>procedures</b> where relevant committees support the European Commission whenever it has delegated legislative powers). The Member State’s European viability can be considered in terms of four complementary to each other spheres which can be referred to as relational areas: (a) domestic EU law and policies implementation area, in which the adequate recognition of acquis by relevant national authorities and bodies as well as its complete and effective implementation on the national ground is at stake, (b) cooperation-negotiation area, where the identification of national interests in the EU decision-making process, their substantiation and ultimate recasting into balanced mandates and persuasive negotiation argumentation later presented at the EU level should occur, (c) legitimization area, where positions presented by national administration in various EU decision-making gremia are given necessary political support by adequately identified domestic groups of significant interests and/or key national authorities elected by a broad suffrage (i. e. the parliament and, usually, regional and local self-governmental bodies), (d) litigation area, in which proper protection of national interests within the EU judicial system (i. e. through the Court of Justice or the Court of First Instance) is at stake, irrespective of whether the state appears as a plaintiff or a defendant, or an intervenient, in a given case under these European courts’ scrutiny...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the reforms}} {{introduced}} by the Treaty of Lisbon was to simplify and make more transparent the system of Union legal sources {{and that of the}} decision-making procedures. This paper examines that how the system of Union legal sources and that of the previous legislative and decision-making procedures were modified and changed with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The study also deals with the question whether the European Union has progressed due to the new legal system or not, that is to say whether the objectives of making the legal system of the European Union more simple and more transparency as set out in the Laeken Declaration have been achieved or not.

5000|$|Comitology in the European Union {{refers to}} a process by which EU law is {{modified}} or adjusted and takes place within [...] "comitology committees" [...] chaired by the European Commission. The official term for the process is committee <b>procedure.</b> <b>Comitology</b> committees {{are part of the}} EU's broader system of committees that assist in the making, adoption, and implementation of EU laws. The comitology system was reconfigured by the Lisbon Treaty which introduced the current Articles 290 and 291 TFEU. Whereas Article 291 TFEU provides for a continuation of implementation of EU law through comitology, Article 290 TFEU introduced the delegated act which is now used to amend or supplement EU legislation, whereas beforehand this was also done through comitology.|$|R
40|$|European Governance is {{more than}} just a policy {{instrument}} without legal significance. Its regulatory sub-divisions, such as <b>Comitology,</b> the Lamfalussy <b>procedure,</b> and the growing number of European administrative agencies, have colonized substantive parts of the law-shaping and law-making processes. This contribution argues that European Governance is a distinct phenomenon that cannot be easily reconciled with traditional notions of legislation and administration, but needs to be theorized differently. Accordingly, its legal shape has to be adjusted to this new situation, too. Neither a - still only vaguely defined - concept of ‘accountability’, nor a non-binding policy concept of ‘good governance’ can fill this gap. A re-definition of European Governance - as an ‘integrating administration’ – has to take the new developments of a distinct European administrative governance sphere seriously. At the same time, it has to address the specific legitimatory problématique of the new governance structures in a sufficient manner. The specific character of these structures calls for an institutionalization of participatory patterns within the governance structures: by ensuring the involvement of civil society actors, stakeholders and the public in the arguing, bargaining, and reasoning processes of both European governance and European regulation, the odd position of European governance, which oscillates between legislative and administrative functions, can be targeted more adequately. accountability; comitology; multilevel governance; regulation; European law...|$|R
