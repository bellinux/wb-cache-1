As of December 31, 2010, the Company owned or operated a modern fleet of 111 vessels (aggregating 11.3 million deadweight tons and 864,800 cubic meters) of which 88 vessels operated in the international market and 23 operated in the U.S. Flag market. OSG’s newbuilding program of owned and chartered-in vessels totaled 11 International and U.S. Flag vessels, bringing the Company’s total owned, operated and newbuild fleet to 122 vessels. The Company’s vessel operations are organized into strategic business units and focused on market segments: crude oil, refined petroleum products, and U.S. Flag. The International Flag <b>Crude</b> <b>Tanker</b> unit manages International Flag {{ultra large crude carrier}} (ULCC), very large crude carrier (VLCC), Suezmax, Aframax, Panamax and Lightering tankers; the International Flag Product Carrier unit principally manages LR1 and MR product carriers and the U.S. unit manages most of the Company’s U.S. Flag vessels. Through joint venture partnerships, the Company operates four LNG carriers and two Floating Storage and Offloading (FSO) service vessels.During the year ended December 31, 2010, OSG took delivery of 11 vessels. During 2010, the Company sold three owned U.S. Flag vessels, the Overseas Philadelphia, Overseas Diligence and Overseas Galena Bay, and one chartered-in International Flag Aframax, the Sabine, a chartered-in lightering vessel.

40|$|The ship-demolition {{is one of}} {{the four}} main markets that form the {{shipping}} industry and plays an important role on the seaborne trade, as it mitigates imbalances between supply and demand for transportation services by adjusting the merchant fleet supply. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine whether the factors that determine the supply of vessels for demolition are capable of affecting materially the ship-demolition price formation. The availability of ships for demolition is primarily a function of the fleet’s age and the conditions on the freight and secondhand markets. The analysis is conducted on the <b>crude</b> <b>tanker</b> and the bulk carrier segments and the vector autoregressive model methodology is employed, whereby the effect of both the supply and the demand factors on the ship-demolition prices is examined. The results indicate that the supply side has limited effect on the price formation in the industry, which is driven by the demand for the steel-scrap commodity...|$|E

5|$|An oil tanker, {{also known}} as a {{petroleum}} tanker, is a merchant ship designed for the bulk transport of oil. There are two basic types of oil tankers: <b>crude</b> <b>tankers</b> and product <b>tankers.</b> <b>Crude</b> <b>tankers</b> move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries. For example, moving crude oil from oil wells in Nigeria to the refineries on the coast of the United States. Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets. For example, moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of {{consolidation}} strategies amongst crude carrier operators anxious to reduce costs and attract institutional capital. Could consolidation combat erratic tonnage demand, mounting regulatory pressure to provide quality service at reduced costs, rising costs of finance and unpredictable long-term returns that deter institutional capital? A questionnaire survey of capital providers' and charterers' attitudes towards consolidation found that long-term vessel employment concerned all potential capital providers, with perceptions of management experience and reputation critical to risk evaluation. Debt type providers were more supportive of consolidation practices, expecting more predictable repayment of principal and interest payments in larger companies, but equity type providers feared reduced opportunities to participate in speculative capital gains or asset play. Comparative interviews with two major crude carrier operators revealed contrasting strategies. One concentrated on pursuing short-term wealth maximisation through ensuring operational autonomy and asset flexibility and another on long-term wealth creation based on ballast minimisation and tactical capacity expansion. Long-term, a trend towards oligopoly is expected in <b>crude</b> <b>tanker</b> carriage, with competitive strategies likely to focus increasingly on differentiation as the potential for operational cost-reduction fades.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is “How did the oil price {{influence}} the freight rates for VLCC crude oil tankers between 2005 and 2015 ?” The oil price {{is important for the}} development of world economic activity, as oil is a primary energy source. Given that oil is mainly transported in tankers, the oil price has substantial influence on <b>crude</b> <b>tanker</b> freight rates. The period 2005 - 15 was eventful with large movements in both the oil price and freight rates. The analysis in this thesis is based on a basic supply and demand model, as well as a more specific model of the shipping market developed by the shipping economist, Martin Stopford. The correlation between the oil price and freight rates varies across time, and the oil market affects freight rates both directly and indirectly. The freight market is influenced by predictable factors such as economic activity and fleet growth, which develop gradually over time. However, “random shocks” is the most important variable in Stopford’s model. One such shock was the global financial crisis, when oil prices and freight rates dropped significantly. While oil prices recovered quickly, freight rates remained low for years. Another random shock was the American shale oil revolution, which led to substantial increases in oil production. Subsequently, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries sacrificed their objective to maintain stable and high oil prices and instead chose to protect their market share. Consequently, the oil prices dropped, while the freight rates started to increase following the growing demand for cheap oil. This thesis demonstrates how unpredictable elements, such as oil price movements, have influenced the tanker market, and thus the fortunes of tanker owners. Fluctuations have always been {{an important part of the}} shipping market, and make the shipping sector an interesting object of study...|$|E
