40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} polydioxanon absorbable suture for tracheal anastomoses, we performed an experimental study using dose. Eight adult mongrel dogs underwent sleeve resection of the mediastinal trachea. A length of ten to twelve cartilage rings was resected. An end-to-end anastomosis was performed using either interrupted or <b>continuous</b> <b>running</b> 4 - 0 polydioxanone (PDS) suture. There was no detectable difference bronchoscopically, microangiografically, or histologically, in tracheal anastomotic healing between interrupted suture and <b>continuous</b> <b>running</b> suture. The inflammatory tissue response was mild and disappeared 3 weeks after surgery. The breaking strength, however, was greater in dogs in which interrupted sutures were used than in those with a <b>continuous</b> <b>running</b> sutures. We conclude that PDS is a useful suture material for tracheal anastomoses and that interrupted sutures are stronger and possibly safer than a <b>continuous</b> <b>running</b> suture for end-to-end anastomosis following sleeve resection of the trachea...|$|R

Twelve college age men were divided into two groups, matched according to V 02 max (ml/kg-min). One group trained on a short distance (110 - 660 yards) interval program, while the other group trained on long, steady, continuous runs. Both groups were tested, trained, and re-examined. The testing periods consisted of one all out run to exhaustion and at least two submaximal runs, all on thetreadmill. Variables recorded were V 02 (ml/kg-min), V 02 (1 /min), VE, and heart rate. It was found that both training methods significantly increased the aerobic capacity in terms of V 02 max (ml/kg-min); however, neither method was superior. In addition, it was noted that both training methods reduced the cost of running in terms of V 02 (1 /min) and heart rate but neither method was more effective. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the effects of prolonged <b>continuous</b> <b>running</b> performed at the intensity corresponding to the onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA), on the peak torque of the knee extensors, analyzed in relation to different types of contraction and movement velocities in active individuals. METHOD: Eight men (23. 4 ± 2. 1 years; 75. 8 ± 8. 7 kg; 171. 1 ± 4. 5 cm) participated in this study. First, the subjects performed an incremental test until volitional exhaustion to determine the velocity corresponding to OBLA. Then, the subjects returned to the laboratory on two occasions, separated by at least seven days, to perform five maximal isokinetic contractions of the knee extensors at two angular velocities (60 and 180 º. s- 1) under eccentric and concentric conditions. Eccentric peak torque (EPT) and Concentric peak torque (CPT) were measured at each velocity. One session was performed after a standardized warm-up period (5 min at 50 % VO 2 max). The other session was performed after <b>continuous</b> <b>running</b> at OBLA until volitional exhaustion. These sessions were conducted in random order. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in CPT only at 60 º. s- 1 (259. 0 ± 46. 4 and 244. 0 ± 41. 4 N. m). However, the reduction in EPT was significant at 60 º. s- 1 (337. 3 ± 43. 2 and 321. 7 ± 60. 0 N. m) and 180 º. s- 1 (346. 1 ± 38. 0 and 319. 7 ± 43. 6 N. m). The relative strength losses after the running exercise were significant different between contraction types only at 180 º. s- 1. CONCLUSION: We can conclude that, in active individuals, the reduction in peak torque after prolonged <b>continuous</b> <b>running</b> at OBLA may be dependent on the type of contraction and angular velocity...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study we aimed to {{evaluate}} the qualitative aspects of training that elite middle distance runners employ throughout their yearly training season to improve performance. Additionally we examined how their training methods correspond with the relevant research. We collected information about the usage of interval training, <b>continuous</b> <b>running,</b> uphill running, and strength exercise during the week throughout the seasonal training phases. Ten Spanish coaches, chosen according to their athletes' performance in International Events, {{took part in the}} present investigation. Interval running at 75 - 85 % of (V) over dot O- 2 max and repeated running up to 85 % of (V) over dot O- 2 max are mostly used in the build-up phases and less in the pre-competitive and competitive phases, whereas interval running at 85 - 95 % of (V) over dot O- 2 max, repeated running above 85 % of (V) over dot O- 2 max, and interval sprinting were mainly used in the pre-competitive followed by the competitive phase. Fartlek training and low and moderate intensity <b>continuous</b> <b>running</b> proved to be the most popular methods of <b>continuous</b> <b>running</b> throughout all the training phases, while high and low-high intensity running were mainly used during the pre-competitive and competitive phases. Continuous and interval uphill running is mostly used in the special phase and in a lesser amount in the basic and pre-competitive phases. Circuit training and resistance exercise are used mainly in build-up phases. Plyometrics and resistance running are used in a very small amount in all training phases. The training methods that elite runners employ to improve performance are mostly in line with research findings. However, in some cases recent suggestions, although proven to be efficient by research, seem to have no practical implementation...|$|R
