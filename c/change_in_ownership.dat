5|$|JALways {{became a}} wholly owned {{subsidiary}} of Japan Airlines on March 9, 2001 through {{an exchange of}} shares. The <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>ownership</b> enabled JAL to consolidate and improve management and operational efficiency in the JAL Group's international passenger operations, part of the JAL Medium Term Corporate Plan 2000-2002. The airline introduced new uniforms for its cabin crew on April 1, 2005, and retired its last McDonnell Douglas DC-10 on October 31. JALways became an affiliate member of Oneworld on April 1, 2007, together with four of its sister airlines, in the alliance's biggest expansion in its young history.|$|E
5|$|The {{circulation}} {{rose from}} 64,000 in 1965 to 67,000 in 1967; the modest 5% increase was exceeded only by Analog {{among the other}} science-fiction magazines, and If won the Hugo Award for best professional SF magazine three years running during this period. However, in March 1969, Robert Guinn sold all four of his magazines, including Galaxy and If, to Arnold Abramson at Universal Publishing and Distribution Corporation (UPD). Pohl was in Rio de Janeiro {{when he heard the}} news, and decided to resign his position as editor rather than continue under the new management. He had been considering a return to a writing career for some time and the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>ownership</b> precipitated his decision to leave.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} built by the mining company Sydvaranger, who started {{construction}} in 1907 and inaugurated the railway in 1910. From 1912, the port network received electrification, as did the mainline in 1920. Originally, free passenger trains services were also offered. During the Second World War, the line was largely destroyed, but rebuilt afterwards and re-opened in 1952. Electric traction was abandoned in 1955 when two EMD G12 diesel locomotives were bought. The line closed in 1997, but was reopened in 2009, following a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>ownership</b> of the mine. There are proposals to connect the line to either {{one or both of}} the Finnish and Russian railway networks.|$|E

5|$|In early 2003, The Walt Disney Company and Square Enix {{confirmed}} {{the sequel to}} their commercially and critically acclaimed video game, Kingdom Hearts (2002). That July, the games creator Tetsuya Nomura aimed to have the game in stores by 2004, but several legal issues regarding the approval of characters and aesthetics from the Disney franchise obscured this, such as the Tarzan world being denied due to a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>ownership.</b> Regarding the games theme song, the producer only had Utada in mind as he felt {{she was part of}} the franchise's family, and believed her music could break both foreign and international markets. But scheduling time with Nomura proved to be impossible, as the singer started work on her debut English album in her hometown New York City; she had been signed to Island Def Jam the previous year as their headquarters discovered her success in Japan. Though her debut Western release Exodus was a success in Japan, its commercial appeal was lacking in North America; after promoting it, she moved back to Tokyo to start recording her record Ultra Blue (2006).|$|E
5|$|Kuntz was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} with the Marlins before spring training in 2002. The move {{was part of a}} mass firing of Marlins personnel in player development and scouting after the team's <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>ownership.</b> Kuntz, who was paid for the 2002 season in any case due to the terms of his contract, kept a job working on the grounds crew at the team's spring training site. He had performed ground crew duties at the site for several years in the offseasons. Late in the 2002 season, the Atlanta Braves hired Kuntz as a roving instructor. After the season, he was hired by the Pittsburgh Pirates as a first-base coach. In October 2005, the Pirates offered minor league positions to Kuntz and fellow coaches Gerald Perry and Alvaro Espinoza. He spent the next two seasons coaching between the Class AAA Indianapolis Indians and the major league club.|$|E
5|$|By 2008, {{the club}} was in a financially {{precarious}} position. Thaksin Shinawatra had taken control of the club a year before, but his political travails saw his assets frozen. Then, in August 2008, {{the club was}} purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid for £32.5million. Performances were not a huge improvement on the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over £100million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Kolo Touré, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez and Joleon Lescott. In December 2009, Mark Hughes – who had been hired shortly before the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>ownership</b> but was originally retained by the new board – was replaced as manager by Roberto Mancini. City finished the season in fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on {{a place in the}} Champions League, and competed in the UEFA Europa League in season 2010–11.|$|E

25|$|The {{locomotives}} gained {{their fourth}} owner in 1969 when the New Haven {{became part of}} Penn Central. With the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>ownership</b> came a new designation, E33 (following the old Pennsylvania Railroad nomenclature), a renumbering to 4600–4610, and a new assignment: protecting freight schedules between on the Northeast Corridor and the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line. No. 4600 was wrecked and never entered service. A fifth and final <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>ownership</b> came in 1976 when the bankrupt Penn Central became part of Conrail. Retained and repainted by Conrail, all 10 E33s were retired {{at the end of}} March 1981 when Conrail shut down its electric freight operations.|$|E

25|$|Since its {{founding}} in 1983, Maruti Udyog Limited has experienced problems with its labour force. The Indian labour it hired readily accepted Japanese work culture and the modern manufacturing process.

Shortly thereafter, conflict between the United Front Government and Suzuki started. In 2000, a major industrial relations issue began and employees of Maruti went on an indefinite strike, demanding among other things, major revisions to their wages, incentives and pensions.|$|E
25|$|Both {{consistent}} hashing and rendezvous hashing {{have the}} essential property that removal or addition of one node changes only {{the set of}} keys owned by the nodes with adjacent IDs, and leaves all other nodes unaffected. Contrast this with a traditional hash table in which addition or removal of one bucket causes nearly the entire keyspace to be remapped. Since any <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>ownership</b> typically corresponds to bandwidth-intensive movement of objects stored in the DHT from one node to another, minimizing such reorganization is required to efficiently support high rates of churn (node arrival and failure).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>ownership</b> and internationalization of the brokerage firms in Colombia {{as a result}} of the regional integration process of its stock exchange market through the Latin American Integrated Market (MILA).

In the case of Colombia, stock exchange integration through MILA has resulted into mergers between local brokerage firms, acquisitions from both national and international companies and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>ownership...</b>|$|R
