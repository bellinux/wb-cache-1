5000|$|On May 23, 1974, Aeroflot Flight N-166, a Yak-40 (CCCP-87579), crashed near Kiev due to {{possible}} <b>crew</b> <b>incapacitation,</b> killing all 29 on board.|$|E
50|$|Possible incapacitation of crew by carbon {{monoxide}} emanating from a faulty cabin heater was speculated upon based on recovery crew observations that crew bodies appeared 'discolored.' This theory was never proven, and the CAB report specifically states {{that there was}} no evidence to support <b>crew</b> <b>incapacitation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Semi-empirical {{models of}} hole {{diameter}} and tip-to-tip crack length for different multi-wall shielding systems currently under {{development for the}} International Space Station are presented. These equations were developed using light gas gun test data at impact velocities of 6. 5 km/s and inhibited shaped charge test data for an impact velocity of 11. 3 km/s. These models are incorporated into a survivability analysis using the manned spacecraft crew survivability computer code {{to determine whether or}} not module unzipping or <b>crew</b> <b>incapacitation</b> would occur under a specific set of impact conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} the various human factors issues and {{interactions}} that might affect crew safety is developed. The first step addressed systematically the central question: How is this space station different from all other spacecraft? A wide range of possible issue was identified and researched. Five major topics of human factors issues that interacted with crew safety resulted: Protocols, Critical Habitability, Work Related Issues, <b>Crew</b> <b>Incapacitation</b> and Personal Choice. Second, an interaction model was developed that would show some degree {{of cause and effect}} between objective environmental or operational conditions and the creation of potential safety hazards. The intermediary steps between these two extremes of causality were the effects on human performance and the results of degraded performance. The model contains three milestones: stressor, human performance (degraded) and safety hazard threshold. Between these milestones are two countermeasure intervention points. The first opportunity for intervention is the countermeasure against stress. If this countermeasure fails, performance degrades. The second opportunity for intervention is the countermeasure against error. If this second countermeasure fails, the threshold of a potential safety hazard may be crossed...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} is the Deliverable D 10. 1 - 3 titled “Concept of Operations” for ACROSS, a European Commission 7 th Framework co-funded project. The Emergency Aircraft Control System (EACS) {{to be developed}} in ACROSS WP 10 must deal with a full flight deck <b>crew</b> <b>incapacitation</b> (Configuration 4 of the ACROSS Definitions) and should enable a safe return and automatic landing of the aircraft to a suitable airport. A potential system {{for the detection of}} the incapacitation will be investigated in ACROSS WP 9. During the phase in which the EACS is active it may be in contact with a cooperative ground segment. As defined in D 10. 1 - 1 Candidate Solutions, two solutions ere brought forward to more detailed description in this concept of operations (ConOps) document. During the identification of the candidate solutions, the full spectrum of control over the aircraft systems was considered: From a fully automated Emergency Aircraft Control System (EACS) to fully ground controlled Remotely Piloted Aircraft System. None of these extreme ends of the spectrum will by themselves constitute a satisfying solution at all levels. Therefore, for the purpose of deriving a concept of operations, the two solutions for which ConOps are developed are called “Ground Centered” and “Aircraft Centered”. For the aircraft centered solution, the EACS will navigate, aviate and land autonomously. A ground station linked to the EACS {{will be able to make}} strategic decision such as diversions to alternate airports (for example in the event of runway closure) and uplink barometric altimeter settings. The ground centered solution will have the possibility of using the aircraft as remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) with direct commands to the primary control surfaces. The electronic standby pilot onboard the aircraft still has authority to override ground control (for example in case of a TCAS alert) ...|$|E
