The animals received an iron depletion diet for 21 days, {{followed by a}} repletion diet containing 12 mg·kg- 1 of iron for 14 days. The hemoglobin regeneration efficiency and the relative biological value did not differ between the light mixture and control group. The iron bioavailability of the light mixture of <b>cereals,</b> <b>seeds,</b> and grains and the control group were 99. 99 ± 27. 62 and 80. 02 ± 36. 63, respectively, while the regular and homemade mixtures of <b>cereals,</b> <b>seeds,</b> and grains showed lower iron bioavailability, 50. 12 ± 35. 53 and 66. 66 ± 15. 44, respectively; the iron content of the diet with light cereal mixture light was statistically {{similar to that of}} the control (ferrous sulfate 99. 99 ± 27. 62). The high content of tannin (202. 81 ± 19. 53 mg· 100 - 1) in the diet with the regular cereal mixture may have contributed to its low iron bioavailability. The higher intake of soluble fiber by the animals fed the light mixture (21. 15 ± 0. 92 g) was moderately correlated (r= 0. 5712, p= 0. 0018) with the concentration of propionate in the caecal bulk (65. 49 ± 11. 08 µmol/g). The short chain fatty acids produced by soluble fiber fermentation, associated with the low-content of tannin may have improved iron solubility and absorption in the light cereal mixture diet.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the political and}} economic processes governing Ethiopian <b>cereal</b> <b>seed</b> systems by analysing the overall policy context, as well as the main interests driving seed policy formulation and implementation and the roles and interaction of the different public and private actors. It also examines how these interests and interactions are related to the performance of the system on the ground. The nature of the Ethiopian agricultural sector, the historical evolution of the seed system and the seed specificities for each cereal crops has resulted {{in a wide range of}} actors with diverse linkages and policy processes. The analysis of these processes has identified a number of constraints faced by the Ethiopian <b>cereal</b> <b>seed</b> system. These constraints are a result of a economic and political drivers, including top-down state driven initiatives, agricultural liberalisation and the private sector and political-administrative decentralisation, all of which pull in different directions. While contrasting interests in federal and decentralised state level activities exist, ultimately it is the state-driven imperatives that define what private sector activity is possible. Centrallydirected, state-supported efforts, including numerous campaigns, special projects and programmes along with ad hoc crash programmes, create numerous blockages in the supply and distribution of seed. These ‘pull-push’ factors have brought about severe strains within the system. Thus, it is important that the technocrats, politicians, international donors and supporters understand these political economic drivers of change in the Ethiopian <b>cereal</b> <b>seed</b> system. By addressing these conflicts and contradictions, they may improve their chances of designing and implementing more technically effective and socially appropriate policies. This in turn will help establish a vibrant seed system which offers real choices for farmers in terms of seed type, quantity, and quality and delivery time at reasonable prices. DfI...|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of storage compounds {{is an important}} aspect of <b>cereal</b> <b>seed</b> metabolism. Due to the agronomical importance of the storage reserves of starch, protein, and oil, the understanding of storage metabolism is of scientific interest, with practical applications in agronomy and plant breeding. To get insight into storage patterning in developing <b>cereal</b> <b>seed</b> in response to environmental and genetic perturbation, a computational analysis of seed metabolism was performed. A metabolic network of primary metabolism in the developing endosperm of barley (Hordeum vulgare), a model plant for temperate cereals, was constructed that includes 257 biochemical and transport reactions across four different compartments. The model was subjected to flux balance analysis to study grain yield and metabolic flux distributions in response to oxygen depletion and enzyme deletion. In general, the simulation results were found to be in good agreement with the main biochemical properties of barley seed storage metabolism. The predicted growth rate and the active metabolic pathway patterns under anoxic, hypoxic, and aerobic conditions predicted by the model were in accordance with published experimental results. In addition, the model predictions gave insight into the potential role of inorganic pyrophosphate metabolism to maintain seed metabolism under oxygen deprivation...|$|E

40|$|An {{adequate}} carbohydrate supply {{contributes to}} the survival of seeds under conditions of limited oxygen availability. The amount of soluble, readily fermentable carbohydrates in dry <b>cereal</b> <b>seeds</b> is usually very limited, with starch representing the main storage compound. Starch breakdown during the germination of <b>cereal</b> <b>seeds</b> {{is the result of the}} action of hydrolytic enzymes and only through the concerted action of [alpha]-amylase (EC 3. 2. 1. 1), [beta]-amylase (EC 3. 2. 1. 2), debranching enzyme (EC 3. 2. 1. 41), and [alpha]-glucosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 20) can starch be hydrolyzed completely. We present here data concerning the complete set of starch-degrading enzymes in three cereals, rice (Oryza sativa L.), which is tolerant to anaerobiosis, and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), which are unable to germinate under anoxia. Among the <b>cereal</b> <b>seeds</b> tested under anoxia, only rice is able to degrade nonboiled, soluble starch, reflecting the ability to degrade the starch granules in vivo. This is explained by the presence of the complete set of enzymes needed to degrade starch completely either as the result of de novo synthesis ([alpha]-amylase, [beta]-amylase) or activation of preexisting, inactive forms of the enzyme (debranching enzyme, [alpha]-glucosidase).

40|$|Due to {{reductions}} in winter food resources, newly sown <b>cereal</b> <b>seeds</b> {{have become a}} key component of many bird species' diets, but these seeds are often treated with pesticides that may cause toxic effects. To complete an appropriate risk assessment, data on treated seed toxicity need to be combined with information about the risk of exposure of birds in the field and the factors that modulate such exposure. We studied the abundance of pesticide-treated seeds available for birds in the field, the pesticides and their concentrations in treated seeds, and the bird species observed in the field that were feeding on these pesticide-treated seeds. The exposure of red-legged partridge to treated winter <b>cereal</b> <b>seeds</b> was characterized through the analysis of crop and gizzard contents of hunted individuals (n =  189). Moreover, we measured the contribution of <b>cereal</b> <b>seeds</b> in the autumn–winter diet of partridges in order to assess the potential risk of exposure to pesticide-treated seeds. Density of treated seeds on the soil surface after sowing (11 · 3  ±  1 · 2  seeds m in the centre of field and 43 · 4  ±  5 · 5  seeds m in the headlands) was enough to provide, in an area between 6 and 50  m, doses of six active ingredients above those indicating acute (i. e. a dose capable of killing 50 % of individuals of a sensitive species) and / or chronic (no observed effect level) toxicity. Up to 30 bird species were observed consuming treated <b>cereal</b> <b>seeds</b> in recently sown fields. Corn bunting was identified as an appropriate focal passerine species for the risk assessment of pesticide-treated seeds. We found that treated seeds were an important route of pesticide ingestion for red-legged partridge; pesticide residues (six fungicides and two insecticides) were found in 32 · 3 % of crops and gizzards. <b>Cereal</b> <b>seeds</b> represented more than half (53 · 4  ±  4 · 3 %) of total biomass consumed by partridges from October to February. Synthesis and applications. The field exposure data combined with previous studies about the toxicity to partridges of using pesticide-treated seeds point to an unacceptable risk of this practice to farmland birds. Our results suggest that the prophylactic use of pesticide-coated seeds should be avoided, with the approval of this treatment considered on a case-by-case basis and accompanied with specific measures to minimize risks of adverse effects on avian communities.

Wheat screening is one of the these sources of feed which need to be considered. Determination of physicochemical content, metabolizable energy (ME) and protein digestibility may lead to elucidate the quality of this feed as well as arrangement in feed formulation of broiler ration. Physical content of two types of wheat screening (W.

40|$|The {{life cycle}} of <b>cereal</b> <b>seeds</b> {{can be divided into}} two phases, {{development}} and germination, separated by a quiescent period. Seed development and germination require the growth and differentiation of new tissues, but also the ordered disappearance of cells, which takes place by a process of programmed cell death (PCD). For this reason, <b>cereal</b> <b>seeds</b> have become excellent model systems for the study of developmental PCD in plants. At early stages of seed development, maternal tissues such as the nucellus, the pericarp and the nucellar projections undergo a progressive degeneration by PCD, which allows the remobilization of their cellular contents for nourishing new filial tissues such as the embryo and the endosperm. At a later stage, during seed maturation, the endosperm undergoes PCD, but these cells remain intact in the mature grain and their contents will not be remobilized until germination. Thus, the only tissues that remain alive when seed development is completed are the embryo axis, the scutellum and the aleurone layer. In germinating seeds, both the scutellum and the aleurone layer play essential roles in producing the hydrolytic enzymes for the mobilization of the storage compounds of the starchy endosperm, which serve to support early seedling growth. Once this function is completed, scutellum and aleurone cells undergo PCD; their contents being used to support the growth of the germinated embryo. PCD occurs with tightly controlled spatial-temporal patterns allowing coordinated fluxes of nutrients between the different seed tissues. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge of the tissues undergoing PCD in developing and germinating <b>cereal</b> <b>seeds,</b> focussing on the biochemical features of the process. The effect of hormones and redox regulation on PCD control will be discussed...|$|R
