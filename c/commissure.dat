5|$|As {{is typical}} for such small animals, {{there are no}} {{respiratory}} or circulatory organs. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one {{on either side of}} the pharynx, connected by a <b>commissure.</b> From these lead a pair of nerve cords which run along either side of the body beside the longitudinal muscle bands. The primary sensory organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface which function as mechanoreceptors. There are also ciliated pits on the head, simple ciliary photoreceptors and fleshy appendages which act as chemoreceptors.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoral}} hood {{projects at}} the front of the labia <b>commissure,</b> where the edges of the labia majora (outer lips) meet at the base of the pubic mound; it forms as part of the external folds of the labia minora (inner lips) and covers the glans and external shaft. There is considerable variation in how much of the glans protrudes from the hood and how much is covered by it, ranging from completely covered to fully exposed, and tissue of the labia minora also encircles the base of the glans.|$|E
5|$|The cephalic {{molluscs}} {{have two}} pairs of main nerve cords organized around a number of paired ganglia, the visceral cords serving the internal organs and the pedal ones serving the foot. Most pairs of corresponding ganglia {{on both sides of}} the body are linked by commissures (relatively large bundles of nerves). The ganglia above the gut are the cerebral, the pleural, and the visceral, which are located above the esophagus (gullet). The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are below the esophagus and their <b>commissure</b> and connectives to the cerebral and pleural ganglia surround the esophagus in a circumesophageal nerve ring or nerve collar.|$|E

PurposeThis {{study was conducted to}} determine the canine position in relation to <b>commissures</b> in different maxillomandibular relationships among Egyptian and Saudi populations. Material and methodsTwo hundred subjects participated in this study, 100 from each population. The location of the corners of the mouth for each subject was marked on the buccal surface of a screen previously constructed on the maxillary cast and transferred to the casts. The distances between the corners of the mouth and the caninesâ€™ distal aspect were measured on the casts. The measurements were subdivided according to their relation to the commissures: at <b>commissures,</b> medial to <b>commissures,</b> or distal to <b>commissures.</b> The data were then statistically analyzed. ResultsCoincidence between the canine distal aspects and <b>commissures</b> was recorded only within 8 % of both Egyptian and Saudi populations. Additionally, within the Egyptian population, coincidence was recorded only at Class-I ridge relationship.

25|$|In 1977, Dr. Clarren {{described}} a second infant whose {{mother was a}} binge drinker. The infant died ten days after birth. The autopsy showed severe hydrocephalus, abnormal neuronal migration, and a small corpus callosum (which connects the two brain hemispheres) and cerebellum.

25|$|As {{part of the}} {{embryonic}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} (eCSF), SCO-spondin is of the uttermost importance {{in the development of}} the neuronal system, being a key protein in the balancing of differentiation and proliferation of the neuroepithelium. It starts being secreted by the diencephalic floor plate in the first embryonic stages playing an important part in the development and differentiation of structures such as the pineal gland. In particular, the SCO-spondin appears to have a major role on the growth of the posterior <b>commissure</b> (PC), which was proved when mutants lacking SCO, and hence had no SCO-spondin, where unable to form a functional PC. On early stages of development the axonal growth is stimulated, being inhibited afterwards. A steep gradient of spondin expression in the neuroepithelium signals the need for different processes to take place, favoring the fasciculation on the cephalic region and the incorporation of new neurons on the caudal region. As such, the lower concentrations of SCO-spondin in the caudal region favor the axonal outgrowth and incorporation of new axons on the posterior <b>commissure</b> and the higher concentrations in the cephalic region promotes the interactions between the neighboring axons. In conjugation with the secretion of SCO-spondin, the midline positioning of the SCO assumes a great importance on the axon guidance process. This positioning facilitates the signaling of the turning points for the axons, through the spreading of spondin.|$|E

25|$|The pineal gland is {{the only}} midline brain {{structure}} that is unpaired (azygous). It {{takes its name from}} its pine-cone shape. The gland is reddish-gray and {{about the size of a}} grain of rice (5â€“8mm) in humans. The pineal gland, also called the pineal body, is part of the epithalamus, and lies between the laterally positioned thalamic bodies and behind the habenular <b>commissure.</b> It is located in the quadrigeminal cistern near to the corpora quadrigemina. It is also located behind the third ventricle and is bathed in cerebrospinal fluid supplied through a small pineal recess of the third ventricle which projects into the stalk of the gland.|$|E
25|$|On {{the lower}} {{abdominal}} skin, a slight skin slit {{was made to}} allow the future urethra to be passed through upon inversion of the neovaginal lining. A Foley catheter was inserted and the urethra was sutured onto the catheter, about 5cm distally from its passage through the skin. No skin suture {{was used in the}} urethral meatus, and some kind of scar contraction was always foreseen. Two sutures were bilaterally passed through the perianal skin and the levator ani muscles and served to tightly and firmly support an obstetric stent, placed in the neovagina to provide support for the inverted skin flap. A drain was left in the posterior <b>commissure</b> and, finally, excess scrotal skin was resected to obtain a good appearance of the major labia.|$|E
25|$|Thermal burns usually {{result from}} placing hot food or {{beverages}} in the mouth. This may occur {{in those who}} eat or drink before a local anesthetic has worn off. The normal painful sensation is absent and a burn may occur. Microwave ovens sometimes produce food which is cold externally and very hot internally, and {{this has led to}} a rise in the frequency of intra-oral thermal burns. Thermal food burns are usually on the palate or posterior buccal mucosa, and appear as zones of erythema and ulceration with necrotic epithelium peripherally. Electrical burns more commonly affect the oral <b>commissure</b> (corner of the mouth). The lesions are usually initially painless, charred and yellow with little bleeding. Swelling then develops and by the fourth day following the burn the area becomes necrotic and the epithelium sloughs off.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} peroxidasin pxn- 2 on axon regeneration in C. elegans. Peroxidasins comprise a gene family with homologues in C. elegans, Drosophila, and Homo sapiens. Peroxidasins are believed {{to contribute to the}} extracellular matrix, but the function(s) of peroxidasin proteins are currently unknown. We used RNA interference to display a mutant-like phenotype through pxn- 2 knockdown in wild type and unc- 70 worms. The unc- 70 worms carry a ÃŸ-spectrin mutation rendering their axons unable to withstand mechanical strain, and hence they break in response to natural tensile forces incurred during movement. The axons of DD Gaba-ergic motor neurons of both wild type and unc- 70 worm strains were tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), so the extent of regeneration in axonal <b>commissures</b> could be easily assessed. We found that the axon regeneration in the unc- 70 worms that exhibited pxn- 2 knockdown were significantly inhibited, with an average of 5. 5 complete <b>commissures</b> compared with the average of 9. 9 complete <b>commissures</b> found in the unc- 70 worms with normal pxn- 2 expression. With an average of 4. 75 incomplete <b>commissures</b> and 4. 23 missing <b>commissures,</b> the unc- 70 worms affected by pxn- 2 knockdown indicate that pxn- 2 {{plays an important role in}} axon regeneration...|$|R

25|$|Despite being a much conserved {{structure}} throughout evolution, {{there are}} some differences on the SCO from different mammals. It is the first secretory structure to differentiate and remains fully developed and functional during the life of almost every vertebrate, excluding bats, anthropoid apes and humans. More specifically, in humans, the SCO development has a regressive nature. It reaches its apex development in fetus from 3 to 5 month old, functioning as a fully active secretory structure of the brain during this time span, and extending from the pineal recess over the posterior <b>commissure</b> to the mesocoelic recess. It is composed by a characteristic high columnar epithelium, which is {{not found in the}} adult SCO. Following this maxed developed state, the SCO starts regressing and in children from 3 to 4 years old it already has a vestigial character, being reduced to islet like structures on the adult. Although the remaining cells can possess some secretory material the SCO is truly vestigial in both structure and secretory function, in adults.|$|E
500|$|The hippocampus, {{including}} the dentate gyrus, has {{the shape of}} a curved tube, which has been compared to a seahorse, and a ram's horn (Cornu Ammonis).

It can be distinguished as an area where the cortex narrows into a single layer of densely packed pyramidal neurons, which curl into a tight U shape. One edge of the [...] "U," [...] â€“ CA4, is embedded into the backward-facing, flexed dentate gyrus. The hippocampus is described as having an anterior and posterior part (in primates) or a ventral and dorsal part in other animals.

5000|$|Euthyneury is a plesiomorphic {{condition}} {{present in}} some gastropods {{which is a}} result of two evolutionary events.

2500|$|Peek {{was born}} in Salt Lake City, Utah with macrocephaly, damage to the cerebellum, and {{agenesis}} of the corpus callosum, {{a condition in which}} the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain is missing; in Peek's case, secondary connectors such as the anterior <b>commissure</b> were also missing. There is speculation that his neurons made unusual connections due to the absence of a corpus callosum, which resulted in an increased memory capacity. According to Peek's father, Fran (Francis) Peek, Kim was able to memorize things from the age of 16â€“20 months. He read books, memorized them, and then placed them upside down on the shelf to show that he had finished reading them, a practice he maintained all his life. He could speed through a book in about an hour and remember almost everything he had read, memorizing vast amounts of information in subjects ranging from history and literature, geography and numbers to sports, music and dates. Peek read by scanning the left page with his left eye, then the right page with his right eye.

2500|$|Afferent {{nociceptive}} fibers (those {{that send}} information to, {{rather than from}} the brain) travel back to the spinal cord where they form synapses in its dorsal horn. This nociceptive fiber (located in the periphery) is a first order neuron. The cells in the dorsal horn are divided into physiologically distinct layers called laminae. Different fiber types form synapses in different layers, and use either glutamate or substance P as the neurotransmitter. AÎ´ fibers form synapses in laminae I and V, C fibers connect with neurons in lamina II, AÎ² fibers connect with lamina I, III, & V. [...] After reaching the specific lamina within the spinal cord, the first order nociceptive project to second order neurons that cross the midline at the anterior white <b>commissure.</b> The second order neurons then send their information via two pathways to the thalamus: the dorsal column medial-lemniscal system and the anterolateral system. The first is reserved more for regular non-painful sensation, while the lateral is reserved for pain sensation. Upon reaching the thalamus, the information is processed in the ventral posterior nucleus and sent to the cerebral cortex in the brain via fibers in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. As there is an ascending pathway to the brain that initiates the conscious realization of pain, there also is a descending pathway which modulates pain sensation. The brain can request the release of specific hormones or chemicals that can have analgesic effects which can reduce or inhibit pain sensation. The area of the brain that stimulates the release of these hormones is the hypothalamus.|$|E
