40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Italy, herewith {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from BASF Italia Srl. to modify the existing MRLs for metaflumizone in various crops. In order to accommodate for the intended uses of metaflumizone in Europe, Italy proposed to raise the existing MRLs for all the crops under consideration, except for pepper, <b>head</b> <b>cabbage,</b> Brussels sprouts, <b>lettuce,</b> scarole, melon and watermelon as well as to raise MRLs for several animal commodities. According to EFSA, the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for all crops under consideration, except for melons, watermelons, herbs and salad plants (except lettuce). For peppers, Brussels sprouts and <b>head</b> <b>cabbage</b> no need to modify the existing MRL was identified [...] The new intended use on cotton seed will not affect the existing livestock dietary burden and thus the potential carry-over of metaflumizone residues into food of animal origin was not further investigated. According to risk assessment results, acute consumer intake concerns cannot be excluded for residues in scarole and lettuce from indoor use and in broccoli from SEU use. The less critical NEU use on broccoli and lettuce and intended uses of metaflumizone on other crops under consideration will not result in consumer intake concerns. However, in case residues of metaflumizone occur in lettuce, broccoli and Chinese cabbage at the derived MRL value, acute consumer intake concerns cannot be excluded. Risk managers should decide whether the safety margin of the exposure assessment based on the highest residue is sufficient, considering that in reality residues at the proposed MRL might occur...|$|R

Results of analyzed crops samples showed that generally, there was a reduction of dry matter yield of crops produced. Dry matter yield of <b>cabbage</b> and <b>lettuce</b> treated with 0. 05 mg L - 1 Cd concentration of irrigation water reduced by 56. 10 and 10. 65 %, respectively. At 0. 1 mg L - 1 Cd irrigation water concentration the reduction of <b>cabbage</b> and <b>lettuce</b> dry matter yield were 61. 17 and 16. 57 %, respectively, compared with values of controlled crops.

During the past decade (1991 to 2001), production of fresh <b>head</b> <b>cabbage</b> and sauerkraut in New York State increased 61 percent and 23 percent, respectively. During the same period, per capita consumption of fresh cabbage increased from 8. 2 pounds to 8. 8 pounds (an increase of 7. 3 percent), while consumption of sauerkraut stayed stable at around 1. 3 pounds (a decrease of between 2. 2 to 2. 3 pounds from the 1960 s to? 70 s levels (USDA, 2004). The consumption trends of fresh <b>head</b> <b>cabbage</b> and sauerkraut clearly reflect today?s consumers? food preferences, which are strongly determined by an increasing desire and interest in both fresher and more complex and exciting food products. The incorporation of fresh cabbage to bagged salads is thought to be a major contributing factor to the observed increase in consumption of fresh <b>head</b> <b>cabbage.</b> On the other hand, sauerkraut sold and consumed today in the U.
