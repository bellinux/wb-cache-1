5|$|Muskrats {{spend much}} of their time in the water and are well suited for their semiaquatic life. They can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less {{sensitive}} to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals. They can <b>close</b> <b>off</b> their ears to keep the water out. Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, their tails are their main means of propulsion.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks after}} {{the failure of the}} operation, a second attack was {{launched}} which proved more successful in sinking a blockship {{at the entrance to the}} canal but ultimately did not <b>close</b> <b>off</b> Bruges completely. Further plans to attack Ostend came to nothing during the summer of 1918, and the threat from Bruges would not be finally stopped until the last days of the war, when the town was liberated by Allied land forces.|$|E
5|$|Because the 1924 Rose Bowl {{and several}} later Rose Bowls had very high ticket sales, the Tournament of Roses Association decided to <b>close</b> <b>off</b> the {{southern}} end of the Rose Bowl stadium and expand the seating from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field. The 1924 game was the first in which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for ticket sales. The strategy has been used since, with only a small number of tickets allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{entering}} the war, the Navy had immediately established a blockade of Germany. The Navy's Northern Patrol <b>closed</b> <b>off</b> {{access to the}} North Sea, while the Dover Patrol <b>closed</b> <b>off</b> access to the English Channel. The Navy also mined the North Sea. As well as <b>closing</b> <b>off</b> the Imperial German Navy's access to the Atlantic, the blockade largely blocked neutral merchant shipping heading to or from Germany. The blockade was maintained during the {{eight months after the}} armistice was agreed to force Germany to end the war and sign the Treaty of Versailles.|$|R

5|$|Group D, finally, was {{tasked with}} {{advancing}} south from its landing point to <b>close</b> <b>off</b> an escape route that ran between {{the sea and}} an inland lagoon towards the city of Hué. Landing at 04:30, the group made quick progress through the beach and dunes, secured the small city of Thé Chi Dong and hit the north coast of the lagoon by 05:30, thereby sealing off that escape route with no enemy contact. The final act of sealing the noose was to move some of the French Navy vessels north to the Vietnamese villages of Ba-Lang and An-Hoi where any attempt by Regiment 95 to flee by sea would have taken place.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years, Bonds batted as the leadoff hitter. With Van Slyke {{also in the}} outfield, the Pirates had a venerable {{defensive}} tandem that worked together to cover {{a lot of ground}} on the field although they were not <b>close</b> <b>off</b> the field. The Pirates experienced a surge in fan enthusiasm with Bonds on the team and set the club attendance record of 52,119 in the 1987 home opener. That year, he hit 25home runs in his second season, along with 32stolen bases and 59RBIs.|$|E
5|$|Shinano was {{designed}} to load and fuel her aircraft on deck where it was safer for the ship; experiences in the Battles of Midway and the Coral Sea had demonstrated that the existing doctrine of fueling and arming their aircraft below decks was a real danger to the carriers if they were attacked while doing so. Much of Shinanos hangar was left open for better ventilation, although steel shutters could <b>close</b> <b>off</b> most of the hangar sides if necessary. This also allowed ordnance or burning aircraft to be jettisoned into the sea, something that the earlier carriers could not do with their enclosed hangars.|$|E
50|$|City Center Mall was a {{shopping}} mall located in downtown Grand Forks, North Dakota that was constructed by <b>closing</b> <b>off</b> a block of Third Street. Construction was done in 1978 by building a roof over the former street and walls, <b>closing</b> <b>off</b> the block. Fountains were built where the street was located.|$|R

5|$|There {{were some}} {{significant}} {{problems with the}} casemate guns early on, however. They were equipped with hinged plates that were designed to <b>close</b> <b>off</b> the casemate opening in heavy seas. The plates were easily washed away, though, and without them, water easily entered the ship and caused significant flooding. This problem was {{compounded by the fact}} that they had been mounted too low in the hull, which subjected them to heavier pounding from rough seas. The problem was eventually corrected by the addition of dwarf bulkheads in the gun houses and rubber seals to the hinged plates.|$|E

Roger (now missing his wigs until it's here) Picks up the wigs instead klaus that he still go to cowboy weddings, leaving him behind. Franice tell the family to take one at the time as the rope is too weak. Unfortunately, Jeff was too panicked to wait. He jumps on the rope witch ends up tearing it down, angering hayley.|$|E
5|$|The Hound Pits pub, {{which acts}} {{as a base for}} the player, was {{initially}} a larger structure. Filling out the interior of the pub required too many stairs and rooms, and the large amount of climbing made navigation confusing. The team found retaining the large exterior they wanted while creating and disguising a smaller interior that was easier to traverse challenging. The pub's exterior was shrunk to resemble an Edwardian building, but the interior remained labyrinthine so Colantonio required that a chain be placed outside Corvo's bedroom, allowing him to reach the roof quickly. In frustration, the designers decided to simply <b>close</b> <b>off</b> the third floor entirely. The art team continued to receive requests throughout development, requiring them to extend pre-production {{until the end of the}} development cycle. Each design was hand drawn.|$|E

5|$|Two {{years passed}} {{before the next}} attempt on the Ostend locks. The First Ostend Raid was {{conducted}} {{in tandem with the}} similar Zeebrugge Raid led by Acting Vice-Admiral Roger Keyes on 23 April 1918; a large scale operation to block the wider canal at Zeebrugge. Both attacks largely failed, but while at Zeebrugge the operation came so close to success that it took several months for the British authorities to realise that it had been unsuccessful, at Ostend the attack had ended catastrophically. Both blockships intended to <b>close</b> <b>off</b> the canal had grounded over half a mile from their intended location and been scuttled by their crews under heavy artillery and long-range small arms fire, which caused severe casualties. Thus while Zeebrugge seemed to be blocked entirely, Ostend was open wide, nullifying any success that might have been achieved at the other port.|$|E
5|$|White House Counsel Fred Fielding {{immediately}} {{prepared for}} a transfer of presidential powers under the 25th Amendment, and Chief of Staff James A. Baker and Counselor to the President Edwin Meese went to Reagan's hospital still believing {{that the president was}} unharmed. Within five minutes of the shooting, members of the Cabinet began gathering in the White House Situation Room. Haig, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and National Security Advisor Richard Allen discussed various issues, including the location of the nuclear football, the apparent presence of more than the usual number of Soviet submarines unusually <b>close</b> <b>off</b> the Atlantic coast, a possible Soviet invasion of Poland against the Solidarity movement, and the presidential line of succession. Although normally no tape recorders are allowed in the Situation Room these meetings were recorded with the participants' knowledge by Allen, and the tapes have since been made public.|$|E

25|$|An earlier campaign, {{launched}} in Burma in 1837 by the British army officer Captain McLeod, who had travelled up the Salween River {{along the border}} to Thailand was considered proof of British rivalry and ambition. Only the refusal of Chinese authorities to allow him passage through Chinese-controlled territories ended McLeod's mission. Although unsuccessful, the event spurred fears that the British were about to win the race and <b>close</b> <b>off</b> Chinese trade to the French.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013, the National Gallery of Art {{announced}} a $68.4 million renovation to the East Building. This included $38.4 million to refurbish the interior mechanical plant of the structure, and $30 million {{to create new}} exhibition space. Because the angular interior space of the East Building {{made it impossible to}} <b>close</b> <b>off</b> galleries, the renovation required all but the atrium and offices to close by December 2013. The structure remained closed for three years. The architectural firm of Hartman-Cox oversaw both aspects of the renovation.|$|E

On February 6, 2012, Toronto City Council voted to permanently close the street to car traffic, from O'Keefe Lane to Bond Street. The space was official renamed Ryerson Square. It features seating areas, potted plants and is used for a weekly farmers market, student group sign-up days and festivities associated with Ryerson’s week of welcome.|$|E
25|$|All colon surgery {{involves}} {{only three}} maneuvers that may vary in complexity {{depending on the}} region of the bowel {{and the nature of the}} disease. The maneuvers are the retraction of the colon, the division of the attachments to the colon and the dissection of the mesentery. After the resection of the colon, the surgeon normally divides the attachments to the liver and the small intestine. After the mesenteric vessels are dissected, the colon is divided with special surgical staplers that <b>close</b> <b>off</b> the bowel while cutting between the staple lines.|$|E
25|$|While Spain was at {{war with}} England, the rebels from the north, {{strengthened}} by refugees from the south, started a campaign to reclaim areas lost to Philip II's Spanish troops. They managed to conquer a considerable part of Brabant (the later Noord-Brabant of the Netherlands), and the south bank of the Scheldt estuary (Zeeuws-Vlaanderen), before being stopped by Spanish troops. The front line {{at the end of}} this war stabilized and became the current border between present-day Belgium and the Netherlands. The Dutch (as they later became known) had managed to reclaim enough of Spanish-controlled Flanders to <b>close</b> <b>off</b> the river Scheldt, effectively cutting Antwerp off from its trade routes.|$|E
