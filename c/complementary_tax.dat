50|$|The main {{taxes in}} Chile {{in terms of}} revenue {{collection}} are the value added tax (45.8% of total revenues in 2012) and the income tax (41.8% of total revenues in 2012). The value added tax is levied on sales {{of goods and services}} (including imports) at a rate of 19%, with a few exemptions. The income tax revenue comprises different taxes. While there is a corporate income tax of 20% over profits from companies (called First Category Tax), the system is ultimately designed to tax individuals. Therefore, corporate income taxes paid constitute a credit towards two personal income taxes: the Global <b>Complementary</b> <b>Tax</b> (in the case of residents) or the Additional Tax (in the case of non-residents). The Global <b>Complementary</b> <b>Tax</b> is payable by those that have different sources of income, while those receiving income solely from dependent work are subject to the Second Category Tax. Both taxes are equally progressive in statutory terms, with a top marginal rate of 40%. Income arising from corporate activity under the Global <b>Complementary</b> <b>Tax</b> only becomes payable when effectively distributed to the individual. There are also special sales taxes on alcohol and luxury goods, as well as specific taxes on tobacco and fuel. Other taxes include the inheritance tax and custom duties.|$|E

Before enacting this act, one - stage turnover tax was binding which allowed for usage of different tax rates. In general, the excise is a <b>complementary</b> <b>tax</b> to the indirect tax, namely the tax on goods and services. The basic law act shaping the excise are: act concerning the tax on goods and services issued on 8 of January 1993 and the act regulating marking goods witch banderoles issued on 2 of December 1993.

40|$|We {{explore the}} effect of income {{mobility}} and the persistence of redistributive tax policy {{on the level of}} redistribution in democratic societies. An infinite-horizon theoretical model is developed, and the properties of the equilibrium tax rate and the degree of after-tax inequality are characterized. Mobility and stickiness of tax policy are both negatively related to the equilibrium tax rate. However, neither is sufficient by itself. Social mobility has no effect on equilibrium taxes if tax policy is voted on in every period, and tax persistence has no effect in the absence of social mobility. The two forces are <b>complementary.</b> <b>Tax</b> persistence leads to higher levels of post-tax inequality, for any amount of mobility. The effect of mobility on inequality is less clear-cut and depends on the degree of tax persistence. A laboratory experiment is conducted to test the main comparative static predictions of the theory, and the results are generally supportive...|$|E

The aim {{of this paper is}} to understand to what extent and how these transfers affect local tax decisions. We develop a model with two provinces producing one mobile good. The good is taxed according to the destination principle. Final consumers decide to buy the good from the province where it is cheaper. The two provinces engage in tax competition. The introduction of scale economies into the shopping technology generates nonlinear tax reaction functions which make it possible to test the effect of a transfer equalizing local tax bases on tax competition in two <b>complementary</b> <b>tax</b> regimes. Used for this purpose are cigarette and gasoline tax data from Canada. In the case of cigarette tax it is found that nonlinearity in tax competition is almost entirely offset when equalization holds: tax competition in the two tax regimes become closer. The shopping technology for gasoline gives less scope for scale economies, so that equalization does not affect reaction functions. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper assesses {{selected}} revenue, efficiency, {{and equity}} aspects of Chile’s major taxes, i. e., the income tax, the value-added tax (VAT), and excises. Chile’s present overall tax burden, at about 20 percent of GDP, {{is in line}} with that in its neighboring countries. Whether any change from this level is desirable depends in a fundamental way on the public expenditure needs of the country without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability. Chile has a top personal income tax (PIT) rate (45 percent) that is at {{the high end of the}} international spectrum, and a corporate income tax (CIT) rate (15 percent) that is an outlier at the low end. The gap between these two rates (the income rate gap) of 30 percentage points could entail important revenue, efficiency, and equity costs that must be weighed carefully against any perceived or actual benefits. It may be worthwhile to undertake an assessment of the revenue and efficiency costs relative to the expected benefits of some aspects of the income tax system. Namely, saving incentives presently available, the cost effectiveness of the global <b>complementary</b> <b>tax</b> in achieving its revenue and equity objectives of taxing income on a global income basis, simpler ways of taxing capital and labor incomes, the introduction of royalties for the exploitation of natural resources. There are also a number of areas where existing policies could be reevaluated to enhance the efficiency and revenue potential of the VAT and excises. They include: (1) the special VAT credit to the construction sector; (2) the present exclusion of the excise revenue on many excisable goods [...] especially petroleum products [...] from the VAT base; (3) the role of the stamp duties and the VAT treatment of the financial sector; and (4) the appropriate excise burdens on motor vehicles and petroleum products for revenue and environmental reasons. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the year}} to December 2013, {{emissions}} from Australia's transport sector increased by 53. 5 % compared to 1990 levels. The domestic transport sector now accounts for over 70 % of liquid fuels consumed in this country, with passenger vehicles being the largest source of emission in this sector. Currently, the Australian Government has no fiscal instruments for mandatory fuel efficiency or carbon emission targets to reduce road transport emissions. Part 1 of the two-part series provided ex-post evidence that reforming vehicle purchase taxes/stamp duty differentiated {{on the basis of}} CO 2 emissions was an effective measure to significantly reduce road transport emissions. In 2009, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) recommended that vehicles purchase taxes be reformed on the basis of new vehicles' "environmental performance", and proposed the Australian Capital Territory's (ACT's) vehicle purchase tax/stamp duty as one model for this approach. However, the 2010 Henry Report rejected COAG's recommendation. This article revisits the COAG's recommendations and provides an analysis for Australia's policy makers on whether the tax design and price signal of ACT's vehicle purchase tax provides a model to be adopted by the rest of Australia, or whether an alternative instrument is recommended. The literature review suggests that to achieve significant reductions in average CO 2 emissions from new light vehicles will depend on the choice of tax design, a strong up front price signa 4 level of tax differential, public acceptance, and the interaction of other <b>complementary</b> <b>tax</b> policy measures. The article will assist policy makers in designing tax policy measures for the proposed Energy White Paper in 2015. In turn, this proposal will meet the objectives outlined in the Issues Paper that is, to encourage a behavioural change in buyers that could lead to their choosing fuel - efficient, low - carbon emitting new vehicles, as well as to help address the barriers and challenges to reforming vehicle purchase taxes/stamp duty.

This did not dissuade the thousands of protestors who had already gathered nearby the capital in the less affluent city of El Alto.|$|R
50|$|In close {{relation}} with the income-tax is the estate duty, with its adjuncts of legacy and succession duties. After Pitt's failure to carry the succession duty in 1796, no change was made until Gladstone's introduction in 1853 of a duty on land and settled property parallel to the legacy duty on free personality. Apart from certain minor alterations, the really vital change was the extension in 1894 of the old probate duty into a comprehensive impost applicable to all the possessions of a deceased person. This Inheritance Tax (to give it its scientific title) operates as a <b>complementary</b> property <b>tax,</b> and is thus an addition to the contribution from incomes derived from large properties.|$|R

40|$|Chile is {{currently}} evaluating {{a wide range}} of possible trade policies. Using a global computable general equilibrium model, the authors examine a range of trade policy and <b>complementary</b> <b>tax</b> policy options for Chile. They focus on Chile's principal preferential trade policy options: a free-trade area with MERCOSUR, a customs union with MERCOSUR, and a free trade area with NAFTA. They also examine such options as complementary tariff reduction with nonpartner countries in combination with implementing the free trade area options; unilateral or global trade liberalization; and the optimum unilateral tariff. Their principal policy conclusions: lowering Chile's tariffs preferentially or multilaterally leads to only small gains as Chile starts with a rather efficient external trade regime, uniform tariffs of 11 percent. Largely because of its efficient uniform tariff, preferential tariff reduction will reduce Chilean welfare through trade diversion, unless Chile can improve its access in the markets of partner countries. NAFTA offers enough access to benefit Chile; MERCOSUR does not, once the trade diversion costs of MERCOSUR are taken into account. Under their preferred-elasticity scenario, Chile can convert the MERCOSUR agreement from a loss to a gain if it lowers its external tariff to between 6 and 8 percent. Doing so will also increase the gains from a potential agreement with NAFTA. Chile's current value-added tax imposes distortionary costs because collection rates are nor uniform. Chile will gain if it can collect the VAT more uniformly. Tariff reductions from trade reform will require an increase in domestic taxes, so greater uniformity in domestic taxes (less distortion in replacement taxes) will maximize the benefits from trade reform. Welfare will be improved by moving toward unifromity in the VAT and lowering the Chilean tariff to between 6 and 8 percent. This model ignores dynamic gains from trade liberalization, the result of importing either a greater variety of products or more technologically advanced products.

It is found that commodity taxation has a lower marginal excess burden with tourists than without, although {{this may not be the}} case when tourist arrival is endogenised. We also found that taxing tourism has a positive equity effect because domestic demand for tourism products is mostly from richer household groups. Finally, since tourism products are <b>complementary</b> to leisure, <b>taxing</b> tourism has also a positive disincentive of work effect. Optimal taxation, tourism,...|$|R

This research addresses questions of what policy alternatives to water pricing might improve irrigation water allocation efficiency. An empirical framework is provided to compare irrigation policies for allocating scarce water to agricultural production in Egypt and Morocco. Partial equilibrium agricultural sector models specific to Egypt and Morocco were employed for policy tests. Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) was used to calibrate the models. Water pricing policy, water <b>complementary</b> input factor <b>tax</b> policy, and output tax policy are tested. Results suggest that effective policy depends on the social, economic, and environmental contexts of specific regions.

While due to political risk, economic and cultural concerns, government tends to reject that advice. This study addressed questions of what policy alternatives to water pricing {{could be used to}} improve irrigation water allocation efficiency. Approach: Three policy options include water pricing, water <b>complementary</b> input factor <b>taxes</b> and output taxes were examined. In order to minimize the problems of bias produced by fully aggregated models, sample farms were classified into homogeneous groups of farmers by means of clustering technique. The analysis carried out by means of Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP), utilizing quadratic cost functions. Results: Results showed that effects of alternative policies were strongly dependent on group of farmers and that would create widespread effects on policy goals across clusters. The results also indicated that water pricing policy worked well in reducing the irrigation water use when the water price level was high and will have, in most cases, higher effects than other policy scenarios. Conclusion: Low level of input taxation wasn't a good driver in decreasing irrigation water demand and keeping the welfare level. Water pricing and output tax policies were better suite...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether policies to encourage cattle ranching intensification in Brazil can abate global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by sparing land from deforestation. We use an economic model of global land use to investigate, from 2010 to 2030, the global agricultural outcomes, land use changes, and GHG abatement resulting from two potential Brazilian policies: {{a tax on}} cattle from conventional pasture and a subsidy for cattle from semi-intensive pasture. We find that under either policy, Brazil could achieve considerable sparing of forests and abatement of GHGs, in line with its national policy targets. The land spared, particularly under the tax, is far less than proportional to the productivity increased. However, the tax, despite prompting less adoption of semi-intensive ranching, delivers slightly more forest sparing and GHG abatement than the subsidy. This difference is explained by increased deforestation associated with increased beef consumption under the subsidy and reduced deforestation associated with reduced beef consumption under the <b>tax.</b> <b>Complementary</b> policies to directly limit deforestation could help limit these effects. GHG abatement from either the tax or subsidy appears inexpensive but, over time, the tax would become cheaper than the subsidy. A revenue-neutral combination of the policies could be an element of a sustainable development strategy for Brazil and other emerging economies seeking to balance agricultural development and forest protection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} two <b>complementary</b> {{measures of}} <b>tax</b> progressivity. Relative Share Adjustment (RSA) is {{the ratio of}} after-tax to before-tax shares of income for particular groups. RSAg, a global measure, is the log of RSA averaged over all groups, weighted by group population. It {{is equal to the}} absolute change in inequality resulting from the tax, as measured by Theil’s index of income inequality. Values for the indexes are computed through application of alternative tax functions to simulated lognormal income distributions. The results highlight the contrasts in the distributional effects of different tax structures of similar overall progressivity. This article analyzes two complementary measures of taxprogressivity: one yields multiple measures along the income distribution, and the other is a summary index. Relative share adjust-ment (RSA), introduced by Baum (1987), is the ratio of after-tax to before-tax shares of income for each group: where x, is the pretax income share of the ith group and y, is the group’s share of after-tax income. For example, if the lowest 20 % of the population has 4 % of total pretax income, but 5 % of after-tax income, RSA, =. 05 /. 04 = 1. 25. RSA, is greater than one for a group that benefits, in relative terms, from the tax. RSA, is equal to one if the group’s share of total after-tax income is equal to its share of pretax income and less than one if the group’s relative share is reduced by the tax.

Na Constituição Federal de 1988, a lei complementar ganhou maior destaque dentro do Sistema Tributário Nacional, lhe cabendo, fundamentalmente, duas atribuições, quais sejam: 1 ª) como lei nacional ela determinará regras que devem ser seguidas por todos os entes políticos, indicando, no caso, a resolução de conflitos de competência, a regulação as limitações constitucionais ao poder de tributar e, particularmente, as normas gerais em matéria tributária. A lei complementar nesta hipótese não tem a função instituidora de tributos; 2 ª) como lei federal, de acordo com as hipóteses determinadas no texto constitucional, instituirá os tributos da União. Fica patente, portanto, que a Constituição Federal em vigor, ao tratar da lei complementar em matéria tributária, determinou, de forma precisa, as hipóteses que demandam a sua edição.

Economists uniformly suggest water pricing to improve water use efficiency; however, governments tend to reject that advice due to political risk, and economic and cultural concerns. This dissertation addresses questions of what policy alternatives to water pricing {{could be used to}} improve irrigation water allocation efficiency. It provides an empirical framework with which to compare alternative irrigation polices for allocating limited water to agricultural production in Egypt and Morocco. The Agricultural Sector Model of Egypt (ASME) and the Agricultural Sector Model of Morocco (ASMM) were employed for policy tests. Both are partial equilibrium models in which consumer and producer surplus from agricultural based commodities is maximized subject to various resource, technical, and policy constraints. Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) was used for model calibration, which renders the models more suitable for doing policy analysis. Three policy options were tested: water pricing, water <b>complementary</b> input factor <b>taxes,</b> and output taxes. ^ The research results for Egypt are: (1) irrigation water demand in Egypt is inelastic; (2) N-fertilizer tax policy, energy tax policy, and output tax policy at certain rates can be alternatives to water pricing policy to decrease the planted area of water intensive and low market value crops; and (3) both input factor tax and output tax policy can be alternatives to water pricing to generate revenue for government. ^ The results for Morocco are: (1) water demand is responsive to water pricing policy; (2) output taxes can be an alternative to water pricing at the cost recovery level; (3) energy taxes may not be a good mechanism to reduce water demand until it is very high; and (4) both energy taxes and output taxes can generate comparable revenues to the revenue generated from water pricing at cost recovery level. ^ Policy implications based on key findings are summarized to provide policy makers a reference for their irrigation policy consideration. Limitations of the model are discussed and suggestions for future research are made. ...|$|R
40|$|The three essays of this {{dissertation}} present <b>complementary</b> {{evidence that}} <b>taxes</b> influence {{the structure of}} household financial portfolios. Because an investment can deliver different after-tax returns to different investors, taxes may importantly affect how households structure their financial portfolios. Unlike most previous authors, I rely on policy-driven shifts in the tax system which allow for estimates that more plausibly capture tax effects. Understanding such responses is important for evaluating and designing tax policy. In the first essay, I {{examine the impact of}} the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the 2003 tax act) on household portfolio dividend yields. The dividend clientele hypothesis predicts that the 2003 tax act, which reduced the tax-disadvantage of dividend income differentially across the income distribution, would cause high income households to shift their portfolios toward dividend paying stocks. I find that the relationship between taxes and the types of equities that households choose is consistent with the hypothesis and that responses to the 2003 tax act were large and significant. In the second essay, I estimate the effect of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the 2003 tax act on the allocation of household financial wealth across asset classes. Together, the tax acts increased the tax advantage of directly held equities relative to interest-bearing assets. I find that households shifted their portfolio holdings towards stocks in response to the the tax acts. In addition, changes to retirement account holdings are consistent with households using tax-deferred accounts to shelter their more heavily taxed assets. In the third essay, I consider whether equity portfolio responses to the 2003 tax act differed across households with different levels of financial sophistication. I construct a novel measure of financial sophistication based on the sources of financial advice that are used when making investment and borrowing decisions. I find little evidence of tax response heterogeneity by financial sophistication...|$|R

However, gaps in coverage are common and can only be met by out-of-pocket payments, general taxation, or private health insurance (PHI). This study provides an overview of PHI in different health care systems and discusses factors that affect its uptake and equity. Methods: A representative sample of countries was identified (United States, United Kingdom, The Netherlands, France, Australia, and Latvia) that illustrates the principal forms and roles of PHI. Literature describing each country&# 39;s health care system was used to summarize how PHI is utilized and the factors that affect its uptake and equity. Results: In the United States, PHI is a primary source of funding in conjunction with tax-based programs to support vulnerable groups; in the UK and Latvia, PHI is used in a supplementary role to universal tax-based systems; in France and Latvia, complementary PHI is utilized to cover gaps in public funding; in The Netherlands, PHI is supplementary to statutory private and social health insurance; in Australia, the government incentivizes the uptake of <b>complementary</b> PHI through <b>tax</b> rebates and penalties. The uptake of PHI is influenced by age, income, education, health care system typology, and the incentives or disincentives applied by governments. The effect on equity can either be positive or negative {{depending on the type of}} PHI adopted and its role within the wider health care system. Conclusion: PHI has many manifestations depending on the type of health care system used and its role within that system. This study has illustrated its common applications and the factors that affect its uptake and equity in different health care systems. The results are anticipated to be helpful in informing how developing countries may utilize PHI to meet the aim of achieving universal health care.
