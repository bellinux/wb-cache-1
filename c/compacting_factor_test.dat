Slump and <b>compacting</b> <b>factor</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out on the fresh concrete and compressive strength test on hardened concrete. The concrete cubes were tested at the ages of 3, 7, 28, 56 and 90 days. The results showed that SDA is a good pozzolan with combined SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 of 73. 07 %. The slump and <b>compacting</b> <b>factor</b> decreased as the SDA content increased indicating that concrete becomes less workable as the SDA content increased. The compressive strength decreased with increasing SDA replacement. The compressive strength of concrete with SDA was lower at early stages but improves significantly up to 90 days. An optimum value of 23. 26 N/mm 2 at 90 days was obtained for concrete with 5 % SDA replacement.

Different concrete mixes with different coarse aggregates (both type and size) were conducted. Moreover different shapes and sizes of Vane probes were investigated. Also the influence of using enhancing workability admixtures was studied. The results of the shear Vane test were statistically analyzed and compared with those for standard tests. The results reveal that the Vane shear test with modified blades can be simply executed to measure workability of concrete anywhere with a good efficiency. Useful equations with good correlation coefficients are established between the well known standard <b>tests</b> include <b>compacting</b> <b>factor,</b> slump, VeBe and flow tests and the Vane yield method.

The results of the Vane yield stress could clearly distinguish between not only mixes made up of different aggregate types but also the aggregate maximum nominal size. The results of the Vane shear test are clearly affected by using enhancing workability admixtures and its dosage.

Among {{many different types}} of natural resources, kenaf plants have been extensively exploited over the past few years. Therefore, this report presents an overview of the developments made in kenaf fiber reinforced concrete (KFRC), in terms of water-cement ratio and their physical properties. In this study, constant volumes of kenaf fiber are used and difference water-cement ratio (w/c) in concrete to be main focus. This study concentrated on the workability and compressive strength of KFRC compared to conventional concrete. Three tests were conducted for workability of fresh KFRC namely slump test, vebe test and <b>compacting</b> <b>factor</b> <b>test.</b> Meanwhile, cubes sample were subjected to compressive strength test. All of the specimens were cured in water for 7, 14 and 28 days.

Depletion of HP 1, SUV 39, SETDB 1 or BRCA 1 confer identical phenotypes. The repressive factors, like BRCA 1, are dispensable for the initiation of resection but promote the extension step causing diminished RPA or RAD 51 foci and HR in irradiated G 2 cells. Depletion of the <b>compacting</b> <b>factors</b> does not inhibit BRCA 1 recruitment but at 8 h post IR, BRCA 1 foci are smaller and aberrantly positioned compared to control cells.

On the other hand, Superplasticisers {{can be used to}} increase the workability of concrete. The main objectives of the project were to investigate the effects of Superplasticisers on structural concrete with the addition of short-fibres, which vary from the most commonly used steel fibres, to polypropylene and fibre mesh. The behaviours of Superplasticisers on plain and fibre-reinforced concrete are compared. Lastly, data for the fresh and harden properties of the concrete were collected and analysed. The scope of this project is based on the usage of Superplasticisers in steel short-fibres, fibre mesh and polypropylene short-fibres. To evaluate the effects of Superplasticisers on the workability of fresh short-fibre reinforced concrete, several tests were carried out. These tests consist of slump tests Vebe tests and compacting factor tests.

For any process industry to be sustainable, it should cater human needs as well as protect the environment from the ill effects of its products and by-products. The anthropogenic impact on the environment in the last century has proven to be very negative due to the rapid development of industries. Hence the preservation of global environment, waste management of sustainable development has attracted the attention of environmentalists. The link between the industry and the environment should be balanced. Production of cement concrete consumes enormous amounts of natural resources and both fine aggregates and coarse aggregates causing substantial environmental energy loses.

The POC mix as the control mix and POC mix with 10 % Micronised Silica (TIA 60) as the cement replacement material and superplasticizers (Rheobuild 1100) to produce the selfcompacting lightweight concrete. The test cubes are 100 mm x 100 mm x 100 mm size and wet-cured. Slump test and <b>compacting</b> <b>factor</b> <b>test</b> are carried out to measure the workability of the concrete. Durability of the concrete is determined by the water permeability test based on ISO/DIS 7031, while the compressive strength of the hardened concrete is measured based on BS 1881 : Part 2. Water permeability test and compressive strength test are conducted on the cubes of these two types of concrete mix at the age of 3, 7 and 28 days. This self-compacting lightweight concrete is exhibiting unique properties as low water / cement ratio below 0. 5 exhibits high workability up to 150 mm of slump. The self-compacting concrete requires minimal vibration to achieve high strength. The average coefficient of water permeability is in the order of 10 - 11 m/s, which can be classified as an average quality concrete.

A concrete with very less voids or spaces in it, which were fill with fine aggregates will increased the workability and reduces the quantity of cement required to produce a strong concrete. The increasing demands of the aggregates for the usage in construction, lead to the decreasing of natural aggregate. On the other hand, Malaysia was the largest producer of world palm oil and also creates tonnes of waste product, especially palm oil clinker (POC). POC were created in the boiler when the husk fiber and shell of palm oil are burned to generate energy for the refineries. The POC form was like a porous stones which is grey in colour. It's also were flaky, irregular shaped and the broken edge were rough and spiky. Meanwhile, the practise of abundantly available materials to replace normal aggregates in concrete for structural purposes would prove to be economical. Laterite is a ferruginous, vesicular, unstratified and porous material with yellow ochre's due to the presence of high iron content.

Nano-silica with 99. 8 % SiO 2 content and particles size of 5 to 20 nm used in concrete mixes as a replacement of silica fume content. The total percentage of silica fume and nano-silica was 20 % of weight of binder content. Nano-silica was added in seven percentages (0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 1. 5 %, 2 %, 2. 5 %, 3. 0 %, 3. 5 %) of weight of cementitious materials. The properties of ultra high strength concrete was investigated through twenty seven concrete mixes using nano-silica addition with three different binder content 450, 550, and 650 kg/m 3. Nanomaterials have a larger value of the ratio between surface area and volume than other similar particles in larger size, making the nanomaterials more reactive. Slump test, <b>Compacting</b> <b>factor</b> <b>test</b> and Ve-Be time test {{were used to determine}} the effect of nano-silica content on the workability of concrete, while compression test, indirect tensile strength test, flexural strength test, modulus of elasticity test and permeability test were carried out to determine the properties of hardened concrete.

The test result showed that the addition of nano-silica as cement replacement could improve the mechanical behavior of ultra high strength concrete. The results showed that the optimum dose of nano-scilica was 2. 5 % by weight of cementitious materials. Using 2. 5 % nano-silica can produce ultra-high strength concrete with high workability without segregation. The workability of concrete decreases with the increase in nano-silica content.

This investigation was carried out using several tests, which included workability test, compressive test, indirect tensile test, flexural test and modulus of elasticity test. A total of ten mix batches of concrete containing 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 5 % fibre volume dosage rate on 'wave cut' steel fibres, high performance polypropylene fibres and Fibremesh were tested to determine the enhancement of mechanical properties of concrete. The workability of concrete significantly reduced as the fibre dosage rate increases. This was assessed through standard slump test, <b>compacting</b> <b>factor</b> <b>test</b> and VEBE consistometer test. Results of compressive strength test indicated that the use of fibre in concrete might not efficiently increase in strength.
