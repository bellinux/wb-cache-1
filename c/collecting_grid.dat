A two-dimensional numerical model for a wire-to-grid EHD air blower is developed, validated against previous data, and used to investigate the influence of key design parameters on blower efficiency, including the emitter wire diameter, the blower height, the locations of the collecting surfaces and grid wires, and the <b>collecting</b> <b>grid</b> density. The optimal locations of both collectors from the corona wire are determined based on blower efficiency at a fixed operating power, resulting in improvements in the average outlet velocity between 9 % and 15 %, depending on blower thickness. The presence of the grid has a strong influence on the electric field distribution and increases the blower performance, with higher flow, lower operating voltage and reduced blower size.

40|$|Highly {{conductive}} screen printed metallic (silver) structures (current <b>collecting</b> <b>grids)</b> {{combined with}} poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) are a viable replacement for {{indium tin oxide}} (ITO) and inkjet printed silver as transparent electrode materials. To provide successful integration into organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, screen printed silver current <b>collecting</b> <b>grids</b> should be embedded into a substrate to avoid topology issues. In this study micron-thick conductive structures are embedded and integrated into OPV devices. The embedded structures are produced roll-to-roll with optimized process settings and materials. Topology measurements show that the embedded grids are well suited for integration into OPV devices since the surface is almost without spikes and has low surface roughness. JV measurements of OPV devices with embedded structures on a polyethylene terephthalate/silicon nitride (PET/SiN) substrate show an efficiency of 2. 15 %, which is significantly higher than identical flexible devices with ITO (1. 02 %) and inkjet printed silver (1. 48 %). The use of embedded screen printed silver instead of ITO and inkjet printed silver in OPV devices will allow for higher efficiency devices which can be produced with larger design and process freedom. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

SuperOverlays combine portable image formats, such as JPEG, PNG or TIFF, with geographical metadata tagging in KML files. This has the fortunate sideeffect that SuperOverlays can be easily served via standard web servers. Furthermore, it is relatively simple to programmatically access relevant parts of the SuperOverlay via their URI. This, then, allows the use of SuperOverlays in image processing, which can optionally be supported with a grid computing set-up.

40|$|Active {{materials}} and corrosion layers in positive plates of nonantimonial lead/acid batteries, {{at different stages}} of charge/discharge cycling, have been characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the initial stages of cycling, it has been found that the observed overcharging of cells is responsible for the formation of an underlayer of PbO in the grid corrosion layer, and this blocks the transfer of charge to the current <b>collecting</b> <b>grid,</b> causing rapid capacity loss. In the later stages of cycling at a ratio of capacities for charge and discharge (i. e., C/D) of close to unity, the grid corrosion layer does not possess an underlayer of PbO; however, the active material becomes progressively enriched with respect to insulating lead sulfate. It is suggested that initial overcharging is symbolic of grid corrosion as the rate of gassing side reactions is kept to a minimum by restricting the top-of-charge-voltage (TOCV) to 2. 55 V, while sulfation of active material occurring at CID values of about unity is probably attributable to stratification of the electrolyte and its concomitant effect on sulfation of active material...|$|E

The efficiency of a flexible device with an active area of 4 cm 2 with such a grid {{is much higher than}} a similar device based on ITO. Furthermore, as this composite anode is solution-processed, it is an important step forward towards low-cost large area processing. Moreover, initial experiments indicate that the stability of ITO-free devices is higher than the stability of standard devices based on ITO. This work will ultimately contribute toward fully printed devices, which will provide low-cost manufacturing and improved stability of organic photovoltaic modules...|$|E

In this device configuration, the ITO layer which usually serves as the hole contact {{is replaced by a}} transparent highly conductive poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer in combination with a silver grid deposited by aerosol jet printing. Since the cells are illuminated from the grid side, the optimisation of the grid design is a trade-off between area coverage and conductivity of the grid lines. These factors have been controlled by the printing parameters such as chuck temperature, printing speed and the number of printing passes. In this paper, we demonstrate that continuous, conductive grid lines with a minimum line width of 58 mu m can be processed {{on the top of the}} PEDOT:PSS layer. For single pass printing the area coverage varied from 5. 8 % to 11. 9 % with corresponding effective sheet resistances ranging from 8. 9 Omega to 1. 5 Omega. The ITO-free inverted devices with aerosol jet printed grid (an active area of 1. 1 cm(2)) show comparable performance to the cells with an evaporated gold grid. The effective sheet resistance can be further decreased by multiple printing passes without increasing the area coverage proportionally due to an improved aspect ratio. By increasing the conductivity and aspect ratio by multiple line printing, the cell length in the module structures can be significantly extended...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project {{concentrates on the}} design and control of a two-degrees-of freedom orientation system for the photovoltaic solar panels in sunny regions which are considered very rich in solar energy. A brief background on the sun path and behavior at Latitude 31 ° as an example is discussed {{to help in the}} calculations of the needed angle ranges. The orientation system calculations are based on astronomical data and the system is assumed to be valid for any region with small modifications. The system is designed to control the Altitude angle in the vertical plane as well as the Azimuth angle in the horizontal plane of the photovoltaic panel workspace. The mechanical design is a simplified one using rotary joints and DC motors. This orientation system is expected to save more than 40 % of the total energy of the panels by keeping the panel’s face perpendicular to the sun. This percentage is assumed to be lost energy in the fixed panels. The dynamics of the panel behave like a low-pass filter which facilitates the job of the controller that behaves as a good vibration isolator passing the orientation torques at low frequency and attenuating the high frequency disturbance signals coming from the surrounding environment. Point to point open-loop control is proposed in this mechanism to ensure intermittent motion when tracking the sun. To solve the problem of cloudy days, closed-loop control can be added to the system by using solar tracking sensors and feedback control loops. A special care should be taken to the design of the grid arrangement of panels in the collecting plant. The distance between two panels has to be twice the dimension of the panel to avoid the problem of shadow when the sun is inclined not only in the morning but also in the afternoon hours.

40|$|AbstractPolymer {{solar cells}} offer a {{promising}} low cost alternative in photovoltaics if the expensive ITO electrode can be omitted. Recently an alternative based on highly conductive PEDOT:PSS {{in combination with}} current <b>collecting</b> <b>grids</b> was developed. 1 Electrical modeling is carried out to optimize the grid pattern in these polymer solar cells. The basic inputs {{for this type of}} modeling are the resistivity of the materials, film thicknesses and the diode parameters of the solar cell. The diode parameters are often determined by fitting the experimental current-voltage measurements to a one-diode model. This gives the well-known dark saturation current density (J 0), diode ideality factor (n), photocurrent density (JL), shunt resistance and series resistance. However, the fitted parameters do not always correspond with the intrinsic solar cell parameters, i. e. those that correspond to an infinitesimally small diode, but they are actually lumped parameters containing information of the heterogeneity of the system. For this reason, two one-diode fits corresponding to two different systems (in size and geometry) can yield different intrinsic diode parameters. The reason for this {{can be found in the}} heterogeneity of the system. We show an approach to determine the so-called intrinsic diode parameters, by fitting the experimental IV curve against a simulated IV curve that is obtained from a model in which the experimental solar cells are explicitly modeled in 3 D. This model provides a simple basis to determine the intrinsic solar cell parameters that can be used for the optimization of grid patterns for polymer solar cells...|$|R
