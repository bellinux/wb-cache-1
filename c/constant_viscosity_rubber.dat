40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} <b>constant</b> <b>viscosity</b> natural <b>rubber</b> (CVNR) {{prepared}} with hydrazine dihydrochloride was studied, The {{results showed that}} the relation of dependence of tC 10 and tC 90 on temperature followed the rule below: CVNR> NR a;the sensitivity of tC 10 increment to tC 90 increment due to increasing of cure temperature followed the rule below: NR>CVNR; The relation of MH 0 were as follows: NR>CVNR. Introducation CVNR is prepared by the method of adding viscosity stabilizer into fresh NR latex. The CVNR with difference Mooney viscosity can be obtained through adding various viscosity stabilizers. For example[1] CVNR with low Money viscosity can be obtained through adding hydroxylamine hydrochloride or hydroxylammonium sulphate, CVNR with medium Money viscosity can be obtained through adding aniline or semicarbazide hydrochloride, CVNR with high Money viscosity can be obtained through adding aniline or hydrazine hydrate. CVNR is prepared with the same natural rubber latex and the same production method of coagulating and processing as that of NR, so the molecular structures of CVNB and NR are similar. The main difference between NR and CVNR is that CVNR contains hydroxylamine hydrochlorid...|$|R

30|$|In addition, some {{important}} {{progress has been}} made about free boundary value problems for multi-dimensional compressible viscous Navier-Stokes equations with <b>constant</b> <b>viscosity</b> coefficients for either barotropic or heat-conducive fluids by many authors; for example, in the case that across the free surface stress tensor is balanced by a constant exterior pressure and/or the surface tension, classical solutions with strictly positive densities in the fluid regions to FBVP for CNS (1.1) with <b>constant</b> <b>viscosity</b> coefficients are proved locally in time for either barotropic flows [23 – 25] or heat-conductive flows [26 – 28]. In the case that across the free surface the stress tensor is balanced by exterior pressure [25], surface tension [29], or both exterior pressure and surface tension [30], respectively, as the initial data is assumed to be near to a non-vacuum equilibrium state, the global existence of classical solutions with small amplitude and positive densities in fluid region to the FBVP for CNS (1.1) with <b>constant</b> <b>viscosity</b> coefficients is obtained. The global existence of classical solutions to FBVP for compressible viscous and heat-conductive fluids is also established with the stress tensor balanced by the exterior pressure and/or surface tension across the free surface; refer to [31, 32] and the references therein.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the existence of thermodynamic irreversibility due to laminar fluid flow with heat transfer under fully-developed conditions through a duct of circular cross-section. The evaluation of thermodynamic trade-offs caused by simultaneous heat transfer under a finite temperature-difference and fluid friction has been examined in terms of dimensionless entropy generation as a performance criterion. The temperature dependence of viscosity is taken into consideration in the analysis. Expressions involving relevant variables for entropy generation and pumping power for <b>constant</b> <b>viscosity</b> and temperature-dependent viscosity have been derived. The dimensionless entropy-generation defined on the basis of total heat-transfer rate attains a minimum along the duct length and the ratio of pumping power to total heat-transfer rate increases considerably along the duct length when the fluid is heated. The dimensionless entropy-generation increases as the dimensionless ratio of inlet wall to fluid temperatures ([alpha]) increases, but the pumping power ratio decreases as [alpha] increases. The results correspond to the <b>constant</b> <b>viscosity</b> assumption and temperature-dependent viscosity cases are compared and it was found that the <b>constant</b> <b>viscosity</b> assumption may yield a significant amount of deviation in entropy-generation and pumping power from those for the temperature-dependent viscosity case, especially for more viscous fluids. ...|$|R

Stability results for a piezo-viscous fluid are {{compared with those}} for a Newtonian fluid with <b>constant</b> <b>viscosity.</b> We show that piezo-viscous effects generally lead to stabilisation of a primary flow when the applied pressure gradient is increased. We also show that the flow becomes less stable as the pressure and therefore the fluid viscosity decrease downstream.

50|$|<b>Constant</b> <b>viscosity</b> elastic liquids, {{also known}} as Boger fluids are elastic fluids with <b>constant</b> <b>viscosity.</b> This creates an effect in the fluid where it flows like a liquid, yet behaves like an elastic solid when {{stretched}} out. Most elastic fluids exhibit shear thinning (viscosity decreases as shear strain is applied), because they are solutions containing polymers. But Boger fluids are exceptions since they are highly dilute solutions, so dilute that shear thinning caused by the polymers can be ignored. Boger fluids are made primarily by adding {{a small amount of}} polymer to a Newtonian fluid with a high viscosity, a typical solution being polyacrylamide mixed with corn syrup. It is a simple compound to synthesize but important to the study of rheology because elastic effects and shear effects can be clearly distinguished in experiments using Boger fluids. Without Boger fluids, it was difficult to determine if a non-Newtonian effect was caused by elasticity, shear thinning, or both; non-Newtonian flow caused by elasticity was rarely identifiable. Since Boger fluids can have <b>constant</b> <b>viscosity,</b> an experiment can be done where the results of the flow rates of a Boger liquid and a Newtonian liquid with the same viscosity can be compared, and the difference in the flow rates would show the change caused by the elasticity of the Boger liquid.|$|R
40|$|An {{incompressible}} {{fully developed}} laminar flow in a helical rectangular duct having finite pitch and curvature with temperature-dependent viscosity under heating condition is studied in this work. Both {{the cases of}} one wall heated and four walls heated are studied. The cross-sectional dimensions of the rectangular duct are 2 a and 2 b. The aspect ratio n= 2 b/ 2 a is 0. 5. Water is used as the fluid and Reynolds number (Re) is varied {{in the range of}} 100 to 400.
