500|$|The ninth track [...] "The Hook Up" [...] has a reggae {{feel and}} {{features}} Spears {{singing in a}} Jamaican Patois accent. The ballad [...] "Shadow" [...] talks about how reminders of a lover can still linger after he’s gone. [...] "Brave New Girl" [...] lyrics talk about a young woman finding her passion and losing inhibitions. Backed by choppy, electro-funk beats, she sings in a bouncy near-rap, [...] "She's gonna pack her bags, she's going to find her way, she's going to get right out of this/ She don't want New York, she don't want L.A., she's {{going to find that}} special kiss." [...] The song incorporates elements of the music of No Doubt, Blondie and Madonna. [...] "Everytime" [...] begins with a piano introduction accompanying Spears's breathy vocals, which build from soft to strong throughout the song. [...] "Everytime" [...] lyrics are a plea for forgiveness for inadvertently hurting a former lover. In the song, the singer explains she feels unable to continue in lines such as [...] "Everytime I try to fly I fall / Without my wings I feel so small". During an interview with MTV, Spears said about the song, [...] "It's about heartbreak, it's about your first love, your first true love. That's something all people can relate to, because you all have that first love that you think you're going to be with the rest of your life." [...] When asked if [...] "Everytime" [...] was about Timberlake, she responded [...] "I'll let the song speak for itself." [...] The Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] removes the original melody of the song and adds a clattering backbeat and Punjabi shouts. In [...] "The Answer", Spears sings that her lover is the answer to all her needs: [...] "Who can hold me tight, keep me warm through the night? / Who can wipe my tears when it's wrong, make it right? / Who <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> love till I'm satisfied? / Who's the one I need in my life?". In [...] "Don't Hang Up", she pleads on the phone for her lover to keep her satisfied long-distance.|$|E
500|$|Verne Gay of Newsday {{described}} it as [...] "another fine, fine Lost". [...] The San Diego Union-Tribunes Karla Peterson gave the episode an [...] "A", calling it [...] "one of those dense, chewy episodes in {{which a lot of}} stuff happened to a lot of people, and the foundation was laid for one hell of a season finale." [...] She praised Fox, Evangeline Lilly, Jorge Garcia, Elizabeth Mitchell and Jeremy Davies's work in [...] "Something Nice Back Home", while Tom Iacuzio of The Daytona Beach News-Journal deemed Jeremy Davies's performance deserving of an Emmy Award. [...] The Palm Beach Posts Kevin Thompson [...] "thought [...] Matthew [...] did a nice job conveying a wide range of emotions—scared, haunted, frustration, horny, jealousy, just to name a few." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] "was partly a transitional passage in the Lost saga, a busywork episode designed to put all the characters in position for the year's big finale" [...] and [...] " [...] appendicitis [...] the kind of hardcore castaway survival plotline we haven't really seen since season 1. [...] Combined with a strong character-driven flash story, it was very old school Lost." [...] Jensen also [...] "liked how the episode neatly neutralized one of [...] least favorite season 4 moments, the Jack-Juliet smooch". [...] TV Guides Michael Ausiello wrote that [...] "Fox quietly solidified his status as one of the tube's most reliable and unshowy stalwarts" [...] and deemed him deserving of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV gave the episode a positive review, saying that he was [...] "shocked and baffled" [...] and writing that [...] "Lost … <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> an exciting, well-done episode while making me fear where the series is going … [...] ghosts aren't my thing." [...] The Huffington Posts Jay Glatfelter decided that [...] "what made this episode great was the fact that it just contained so much story [...] Jack's flashforward [...] this one of his most interesting 'centric' episodes. … Not only was Jack's story interesting for a change, but the inclusion of [...] other characters … and giving them great story and character development [...]" [...] Daniel of TMZ graded [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] as a [...] "B". [...] In his recap, he wrote that [...] "if that's the last we ever see of Claire again, that would be BEYOND awesome." ...|$|E

I also {{have to have a}} doctor standing by should something give, but I'm going to tape it up, and I'm going to get out there." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Opera House {{was finally}} completed, and opened in 1973 by Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. The {{architect}} was {{not invited to}} the ceremony, nor was his name even mentioned during any of the speeches. He was, however, to be recognised later {{when he was asked}} to design updates to the interior of the opera house. The Utzon Room, overlooking Sydney Harbour, was officially dedicated in October 2004. In a statement at the time Utzon wrote: [...] "The fact that I'm mentioned in such a marvellous way, it gives me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction. I don't think you <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> more joy as the architect. It supersedes any medal of any kind that I could get and have got." [...] Furthermore, Frank Gehry, one of the Pritzker Prize judges, commented: [...] "Utzon made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology, and he persevered through extraordinarily malicious publicity and negative criticism to build a building that changed the image of an entire country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maria Pearson {{is often}} {{credited}} {{with being the}} earliest catalyst for the passage of NAGPRA legislation; she has been called [...] "the Founding Mother of modern Indian repatriation movement" [...] and the [...] "Rosa Parks of NAGPRA". In the early 1970s, Pearson was appalled that the skeletal remains of Native Americans were treated differently from white remains. Her husband, an engineer with the Iowa Department of Transportation, told her that both Native American and white remains were uncovered during road construction in Glenwood, Iowa. While the remains of 26 white burials were quickly reburied, {{the remains of a}} Native American mother and child were sent to a lab for study instead. Pearson protested to Governor Robert D. Ray, finally gaining an audience with him after sitting outside his office in traditional attire. [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> back my people's bones and you can quit digging them up", she responded when the governor asked what he could do for her. The ensuing controversy led to the passage of the Iowa Burials Protection Act of 1976, the first legislative act in the United States that specifically protected Native American remains.|$|E
2500|$|Aristarchus's [...] "hyper-criticism" [...] {{establishes}} a science for the mock heroic and follows {{up some of}} the ideas set forth by Pope in Peri Bathos in the Miscellanies, Volume the Third (1727). In this piece, the rules of heroic poetry could be inverted for the proper mock-heroic. The epic hero, Pope says, has wisdom, courage, and love. Therefore, the mock-hero should have [...] "Vanity, Impudence, and Debauchery." [...] As a wise man knows without being told, Pope says, so the vain man listens to no opinion but his own, and Pope quotes Cibber as saying, [...] "Let all the world impute to me what Folly or weakness they please; but till Wisdom <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> something that will make me more heartily happy, I am content to be Gazed at." [...] Courage becomes a hero, Pope says, and nothing is more perversely brave that summoning all one's courage just to the face, and he quotes Cibber's claim in the Apology that his face was almost the best known in England. Chivalric love is the mark of a hero, and Pope says that this is something easy for the young to have. A mock-hero could keep his lust going when old, could claim, as Cibber does, [...] "a man has his Whore" [...] at the age of 80. When the three qualities of wisdom, courage, and love are combined in an epic hero, the result is, according to Pope, magnanimity that induces admiration in the reader. On the other hand, when vanity, impudence, and debauchery are combined in the [...] "lesser epic" [...] hero (Pope uses the term [...] "lesser epic" [...] to refer to the satirical epic that would function like a satire play in the Classical theatre), the result is [...] "Buffoonry" [...] that induces laughter and disgust. Finally, Pope says that Cibber's offences are compounded by the outlandishness of his claims. Although he was [...] "a person never a hero even on the Stage," [...] he sets himself out as an admirable and imitable person who expects applause for his vices.|$|E

2500|$|Lord Northcliffe's {{role was}} critical, {{as was the}} use Lloyd George made of him, and of the press in general. Northcliffe's {{involvement}} also highlights the limitations of both Aitken's and Lloyd George's accounts of Asquith's fall. Both minimised Northcliffe's part in the events. In his War Memoirs, Lloyd George stated emphatically [...] "Lord Northcliffe was never, at any stage, brought into our consultations." [...] Aitken supported this; [...] "Lord Northcliffe was not in active co-operation with Lloyd George." [...] But these claims are contradicted by others. In their biography of Northcliffe, Pound and Harmsworth record Northcliffe's brother Rothermere writing contemporaneously; [...] "Alfred has been actively at work with Ll.G. {{with a view to}} bringing about a change." [...] Riddell wrote in his diary for 27 May 1916: [...] "LG never mentions directly that he sees Northcliffe but I am sure they are in daily contact." [...] Margot Asquith was also certain of Northcliffe's role, and of Lloyd George's involvement, although she obscured both of their names when writing in her diary; [...] "I only hope the man responsible for giving information to Lord N- will be heavily punished: God may forgive him; I never can." [...] They are also contradicted by events; Northcliffe met with Lloyd George on each of the three days just prior to Lloyd George's resignation, on 1, 2, and 3 December, including two meetings on 1 December, both before and after Lloyd George put his revised proposals for the War Council to Asquith. It seems improbable that ongoing events were not discussed and that the two men confined their conversations to negotiating article circulation rights for Lloyd George once he had resigned, as Pound and Harmsworth weakly suggest. The attempts made by others to use Northcliffe and the wider press also merit consideration. In this regard, some senior military officers were extremely active. Robertson, for example, wrote to Northcliffe in October 1916, [...] "The Boche gives me no trouble compared with what I meet in London. So any help you <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> will be of Imperial value." [...] Lastly, the actions of Northcliffe's newspapers must be considered—in particular The Times editorial on 4 December which led Asquith to reject Lloyd George's final War Council proposals. Thompson, Northcliffe's most recent biographer, concludes; [...] "From the evidence, it appears that Northcliffe and his newspapers should be given more credit than they have generally received for the demise of the Asquith government in December 1916." ...|$|E
