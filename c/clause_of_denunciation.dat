5000|$|There was {{the danger}} <b>of</b> <b>denunciation.</b> The Constitutio Carolina did not plan for denunciation.

In the case of innocence of the defendant the accuser would be punished. The other way to begin the proceedings was by the personal knowledge of the authorities. This degenerated into a system <b>of</b> <b>denunciation.</b> In some regions during witch trials a box <b>of</b> <b>denunciation</b> (a box hanging or standing at a public place), was used to enable everyone to make anonymous accusations by inserting {{a piece of paper}} without revealing their names, and thus assuming no risk.|$|R

25|$|From {{the point}} of view of style, the poet's work is marked by his simplicity, distant from the grandiloquence and the {{metrical}} structure of the neoclassic poets.
