The aim of the investigation was to establish the weediness’ dynamics of crops in a six-field crop rotation of an organic farming system. The field was certified as being organic. Crop rotation: 1. triticale/ rye (for green manure in spring), 2. oil radish (for green manure) / rye (for green manure in autumn), 3. potatoes, 4. oats, 5. vetch-oats mix (for green forage) with an undersown mixture of red clover and timothy, 6. red clover and timothy. Conventional soil tillage was done according to the requirements of the crops. The weeds were counted two times during the vegetation period of crops: at the early development stages of crops (for instance, at the tillering of cereals) and before the crop harvesting. The composition of weed flora comprised from 59 species in the crops’ stands. The annual dicotyledonus were dominating groups of the weed flora. The most abundant weeds were lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), quackgrass (Elytrigia repens (L.) Nevski), <b>common</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket</b> (Barbarea vulgaris R. Br. p. p.). The significantly smaller amount of weeds among crop rotation links was observed in the link rye/ oil radish/ rye – potatoes – oats. Much worse suppression of weeds was obtained in the crop rotation link red clover and timothy – triticale/ rye – oil radish/ rye. The number of weeds in the fields of crop rotation in the organic farming system is dependent on the cultivated crops, the succession of crops in the crop rotation links and crop cultivation technologies...|$|E

(Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), in cabbage, Brassica oleracea L. variety capitata, in 2003 and 2004. In 2003, {{the numbers of}} P. xylostella larvae found in field plots of cabbage alone were 5. 2 - 11. 3 times higher than those on cabbage plants in plots that included cabbage and several rows of <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket.</b> In an outdoor experiment in screenhouses, P. xylostella oviposition on cabbage was compared among six treatments that varied {{in the percentage of}} <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket</b> in relation to cabbage (0, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32 % of the plants were <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket).</b> Results indicated that the percentage of eggs laid on cabbage decreased as the percentage of <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket</b> in the treatment increased, but this decrease was not significant beyond 20 % of the plants being <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket.</b> In 2004, the numbers of P. xylostella larvae in field plots of cabbage alone were 1. 6 - 2. 4 and 1. 7 - 2. 8 times higher than numbers in treatments with 10 and 20 % trap crop, respectively.

40|$|Ovipositional {{preference}} and larval {{survival of the}} diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), were compared among cabbage, Brassica oleracea L. variety capitata; glossy collards, Brassica oleracea L. variety acephala; and <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket,</b> Barbarea vulgaris (R. Br.) variety arcuata in different treatments of planting density, host plant age, intercropping, and water stress in 2003 and 2004. P. xylostella laid nearly twice as many eggs per plant in the high planting densities of glossy collards and <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket</b> than in the standard planting densities. Ovipositional preference {{was positively correlated with}} plant age in cabbage, glossy collards, and <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket.</b> Larval survival on cabbage was 1. 9 times higher on 6 -wk than on 12 -wk-old plants, whereas larval survival on collards was 12. 1 times higher on the younger plants. No larvae survived on either 6 - or 12 -wk-old <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket</b> plants. Intercropping cabbage with either tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., or fava bean, Vicia fava L., did not reduce the number of eggs laid on cabbage. No significant differences in oviposition were found between water-stressed and well-irrigated host plants treatments. Yet, P. xylostella larval survival on water-stressed cabbage was 2. 1 times lower than on well-irrigated cabbage plants. Based on our findings, the effectiveness of trap crops of glossy collards and <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket</b> could be enhanced by integrating the use of higher planting densities in the trap crop than in the main crop and seeding of the trap crop earlier than the main cro...|$|R
