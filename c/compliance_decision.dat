The rate of voluntary compliance is found to have increased since the introduction of the International Standards Organization (ISO) scheme. Further, voluntary compliance is found to be negatively associated with rates of return and industry share, and positively associated with capital intensity and industry export intensity.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence of}} evasion {{in the context}} of a widely used commuter tax allowance, and explores evasion spillovers as a determinant of the individual <b>compliance</b> <b>decision.</b> For this purpose, we exploit discontinuities in the commuter allowance scheme and employ a research design resting on a large panel of individual tax returns. We find that around 30 percent of all allowance claims are overstated and, consistent with deliberate tax evasion, we observe sharp reactions of tax payers to thresholds where the allowance discretely jumps to a higher amount. Further, we use variation in job changes to uncover spillover effects from the work environment on the individual <b>compliance</b> <b>decision.</b> These effects appear to be asymmetric: job changers moving to companies with a higher fraction of cheaters increase their cheating. In contrast, movers to companies with a lower fraction of cheaters tend not to alter their reporting behaviour. We provide suggestive evidence that the spillover has more to do with an information environment, but can ultimately not reject other behavioural explanations such as asymmetric persistence of norms...|$|E
40|$|Our study {{examines}} whether combining experimental economics and economics psychology techniques {{can provide a}} better understanding of individuals’ tax <b>compliance</b> <b>decisions</b> in the laboratory. We find that considering individuals’ attitudinal, personality and intention measures in addition to economic based variables provides a richer understanding of individuals’ actual tax <b>compliance</b> <b>decisions</b> in the laboratory in the face of monetary incentives. We also find that hypothetical and actual <b>compliance</b> <b>decisions</b> in the laboratory are significantly different from each other. Specifically, we find that actual (hypothetical) <b>compliance</b> <b>decisions</b> are significantly influenced by their moral reasoning (anti-establishment) views. Finally, we find that individuals’ actual complianc decisions in the laboratory correlate more significantly with their admission of prior evasion than either their hypothetical <b>compliance</b> <b>decisions</b> or their responses to case scenarios. The latter result, coupled with the lack of appropriate field data on tax compliance, indicates that actual <b>compliance</b> <b>decisions</b> in the laboratory in the face of monetary incentives and with the use of tax terms in the instructions may be an ideal method of obtaining data on individuals’ tax compliance. ...|$|R

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} have been increasingly {{used to examine}} various issues in tax compliance. The use of laboratory experiments in economics {{began in the early}} 1960 s with the establishment of a well-defined framework for experimental work by Smith (1976, 1982), and laboratory methods are now widely accepted as a methodological approach in the analysis of theory and policy, especially of behavioral economics. For comprehensive surveys of experimental methods, see Davis and Holt (1993) and Kagel and Roth (1995). Tax compliance is an area that seems especially amenable to laboratory experiments, given limitations in empirical approaches based on field data. As discussed in more detail later, theoretical models are not able to incorporate fully, appropriately, or tractably many factors deemed relevant to the individual compliance decision; also, these modeling efforts can benefit from the behavioral insights obtained through laboratory investigations that illuminate many of the factors relevant to the individual <b>compliance</b> <b>decision.</b> Empirical studies of tax compliance using field data are plagued by the absence of reliable information on individual compliance decisions: it is difficult to measure—and measure accurately—something that by its very nature people want to conceal, {{and it is difficult to}} control in econometric work for the many unobservable factors that may affect the <b>compliance</b> <b>decision.</b> In contrast, laboratory methods allow many factors suggested by theory to be introduced in experimental settings.

This study investigates use-tax compliance using a three-step approach. The first step involved building a survey to determine potential salient beliefs that are pertinent to individuals when facing a use-tax <b>compliance</b> <b>decision.</b> Results of the initial survey reveal that the effort of complying with the use tax, potential revenue to the state if the individual complies, fairness of the use tax, monetary concerns of the individual, perceived knowledge of the use tax, and social influences were the most mentioned factors contributing to individuals when making a use tax compliance decisions. The second step in this study develops a model, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, incorporating these salient beliefs.

40|$|Since the {{standard}} model of income tax evasion (Allingham & Sandmo, 1972; Srinivasan, 1973) was published, much research has tested its four parameters (level of actual income, tax rate, audit probability, penalty rate) for empirical validity. Surveys, laboratory experiments and analysis of aggregate data revealed ambiguous evidence for the model’s behavioral implications. The present article reviews these studies and concludes that <b>compliance</b> <b>decisions</b> can only partly {{be explained by the}} rational choice approach. We suggest that depending on the climate in a society, compliance stems from two different factors. In a climate of distrust, high power of authorities is needed to enforce tax compliance and increasing fines and audit probabilities may be an effective tax policy. In a climate where taxpayers trust the authorities of their state, however, other variables gain in importance. Knowledge, attitudes, moral appeals, fairness and democracy may lead to voluntary compliance. In this case, draconian fines and intrusive audits can take unintentional effects and would corrupt tax morale. <b>compliance</b> <b>decisions,</b> tax evasion, audits, fines, trust...|$|R

Recent approaches have applied non-expected utility theory to the <b>compliance</b> <b>decision</b> and have addressed social interaction.

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} {{theoretical}} model to examine compliance incentives and market efficiency under three penalty types: the fixed penalty rate, {{which uses a}} constant marginal financial penalty; the make-good provision (quantity penalty), where each missing permit {{in the current period}} is to be offset with a ratio (restoration rate) in the following period; and a mixed penalty, which combines the two penalty types. Using a simple two-period model of firm‟s profit maximisation, we analyse <b>compliance</b> <b>decisions</b> and the efficient penalty level under each penalty type. Firms‟ compliance strategies are modelled as an irreversible investment in abatement measures and permit buying in the market. Our findings indicate that the penalty type does not affect <b>compliance</b> <b>decisions</b> provided that the efficient penalty level is applied. Market efficiency is retained regardless of penalty types. Nevertheless, the mixed penalty design provides the strongest compliance incentives. Hence this finding supports the practice in which this penalty design is widely used in the existing and the proposed trading schemes. Furthermore, we discuss the policy implications of the findings with regard to permit price discovery process and the Australian proposal of tying the penalty level to the permit price. ...|$|R

Previous bivariate approaches {{were unable}} to untangle the complex mix of factors that may influence fishers' <b>compliance</b> <b>decisions,</b> including enforcement, moral norms, perceived legitimacy of regulations and the behaviour of others. We compared seven multivariate behavioural models of fisher <b>compliance</b> <b>decisions</b> using structural equation modeling. An online survey of over 300 recreational fishers tested the ability of each model to best predict their compliance with two fishing regulations (daily and size limits). The best fitting model for both regulations was composed solely of psycho-social factors, with social norms having the greatest influence on fishers' compliance behaviour. Fishers' attitude also directly affected compliance with size limit, but to a lesser extent. On {{the basis of these}} findings, we suggest behavioural interventions to target social norms instead of increasing enforcement for the focal regulations in the recreational blue cod fishery in the Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand. These interventions could include articles in local newspapers and fishing magazines highlighting the extent of regulation compliance as well as using respected local fishers to emphasize the benefits of compliance through public meetings or letters to the editor.

40|$|The {{legitimacy}} of administrative proceduralisation, which describes {{the process of}} adoption of procedural tools of an administrative character in global governance, is contested in the literature. This thesis addresses this debate by proposing a new purposive legitimacy framework, which facilitates evaluation {{of the extent to}} which administrative procedures achieve desirable purposes in global regulatory bodies. Specifically, this framework examines the roles played by these procedures in: (1) constraining political influences on administrative decision making; and (2) promoting procedural regard for the interests of less powerful states. In this framework, a synthesis of insights from global administrative law, regulatory theory, international environmental law and third world approaches to international law informs the identification of concrete, institutional practices associated with each purpose, which provide tangible criteria for evaluating the desirability of administrative proceduralisation. By linking normative aspirations at a medium level of abstraction with specific procedural and decisional inputs, this framework offers a middle-level theoretical approach to evaluating legitimacy claims. As such, the purposive legitimacy approach departs from, yet complements, the conventional categories of normative and descriptive legitimacy in international law scholarship. The purposive legitimacy framework is applied to the compliance systems of the Kyoto Protocol, the Montreal Protocol and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora. This evaluative process demonstrates that administrative procedures play, at best, moderately legitimating roles in these settings. First, there is a clear trajectory towards greater administrative proceduralisation in these compliance systems. Secondly, a trend is evident in which administrative procedures constrain politics in some domains, yet frequently these gains are offset by the prevalence and re-assertion of political decision-making modes in other areas of <b>compliance</b> <b>decision</b> making with less stringent procedural safeguards. Thirdly, there is little evidence of administrative procedures being co-opted by powerful states. However, with the notable exception of the Montreal compliance system, the potential for these procedures to promote procedural regard for weaker states’ interests remains largely untapped. Thus, administrative procedures play positive, but not transformative, roles in shaping and constraining political influences on <b>compliance</b> <b>decision</b> making...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} issues of market design for emissions trading schemes by focusing on penalty designs and initial allocation mechanisms. Penalty design is {{defined in terms of}} penalty types and levels and the allocation mechanism compare free allocation with auctioning. The first essay employs a theoretical model to examine compliance incentives and market efficiency under three penalty types: the fixed-penalty rate (FPR), the make-good provision (MGP), and the mixed penalty design. Using a simple two-period model of firm&# 146;s profit maximisation, we analyse <b>compliance</b> <b>decisions</b> and the efficient penalty level under each penalty type. Our findings indicate that the penalty type does not affect <b>compliance</b> <b>decisions</b> provided that the efficient penalty level is applied. Market efficiency is retained regardless of penalty types. These findings are used as the hypotheses for the second essay. The behavioural implications of penalty designs on market performance are investigated in the second essay using an experimental method. Three penalty types and two penalty levels are enforced in a laboratory permit market with auctioning wherein subjects make <b>compliance</b> <b>decisions</b> by undertaking irreversible abatement investment decisions or by buying permits. In contrast to theory, we find that penalty levels serve as a focal point that indicates compliance costs and affects compliance strategies. The MGP penalty provides stronger compliance incentives than the other penalty types. Most importantly, a trade-off between investment incentives and efficiency is observed. Using a laboratory experiment, the third essay studies how the initial distribution of permits through free allocation or auctioning, may affect price discovery, allocative and static efficiency under the presence of three penalty designs. Price discovery is not influenced by the initial allocation mechanism. Permit prices remain above the efficient level due to the presence of irrational bidding and trading behaviour as well as risk aversion. Uncertainty regarding permit prices results in a modest allocative efficiency as over-investment prevails. Auctioning evidently generates higher static efficiency due to stronger price signals. This result supports the majority of literature which argues for auctioning. An appropriate auction design is crucial to avoid the risk of overbidding which will inflate the auction price and diminish efficiency...|$|R
