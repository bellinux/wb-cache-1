40|$|An {{important}} goal of chiller operation {{is to produce}} the refrigerated water as economically as possible. The coefficient of performance of <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> <b>systems</b> {{is closely related to}} the temperature lift. In many applications in building services engineering, a temperature lift of 10 – 20 K is in principle sufficient. However, the potential for high efficient systems is not fully exploited as standard chillers are designed for lifts of 30 – 60 K. Measurements have shown that even in state-of-the-art <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> <b>systems</b> considerable energy savings can be achieved by consistent use of small temperature lift. This paper presents practical guidelines for the planning and design of chillers for low temperature lifts. The implementation of these simple measures will lead to a considerable reduction of energy consumption and on-going operating costs. In order to demonstrate the potential for improvement in efficiency, a chiller for small internal temperature lifts was developed and tested. A detailed energetic and exergetic analysis has been performed. For an evaporation temperature of 15 °C, the COP increases with decreasing lift from approximately 4 at 40 K up to values around 11. 4 at 13 K. The Carnot efficiency is around 60 % at 30 K lift and is relatively constant over the relevant range of temperature lifts...|$|R

50|$|A chiller is a {{refrigeration}} unit designed to produce cool (chilled) water for space cooling purposes.The chilled water is then circulated {{to one or}} more cooling coils located in air handling units, fan-coils, or induction units. Chilled water distribution is not constrained by the 100 foot separation limit that applies to DX systems, thus chilled water-based cooling systems are typically used in larger buildings. Capacity control in a <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> <b>system</b> is usually achieved through modulation of water flow through the coils; thus, multiple coils may be served from a single chiller without compromising control of any individual unit.Chillers may operate on either the vapor compression principle or the absorption principle. Vapor compression chillers may utilize reciprocating, centrifugal, screw, or rotary compressor configurations. Reciprocating chillers are commonly used for capacities below 200 tons; centrifugal chillers are normally used to provide higher capacities; rotary and screw chillers are less commonly used, but are not rare. Heat rejection from a chiller may be by way of an air-cooled condenser or a cooling tower (both discussed below). Vapor compression chillers may be bundled with an air-cooled condenser to provide a packaged chiller, which would be installed outside of the building envelope. Vapor compression chillers may also be designed to be installed separate from the condensing unit; normally such a chiller would be installed in an enclosed central plant space. Absorption chillers are designed to be installed separate from the condensing unit.|$|E
40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The South African gold {{mining sector}} consumes 47 % of the mining industry’s electricity. On a deep level gold mine, 20 % {{of the energy}} is {{consumed}} by the refrigeration system. The refrigeration system cools 67 ˚C virgin rock temperatures underground. Underground cooling demand increases significantly with deeper mining activities. Various cooling systems are available for underground cooling. This study focuses on the electricity usage of an ice storage system versus a <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> <b>system</b> for underground cooling. An energy-savings approach was developed to determine possible power savings on the surface refrigeration system of Mine M. The savings approach involved converting an ice storage system to a <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> <b>system</b> and varying the water flow through the system. The water flow was varied by installing variable speed drives on the evaporator and condenser water pumps. The feasibility of the energy-efficiency approach was simulated with a verified simulation model. Simulation results indicated the feasibility of converting the thermal ice storage to a <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> <b>system</b> and implementing the energy-efficiency approach on Mine M. Simulated results indicated a 9 % electricity saving when using a <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> <b>system.</b> Various problems encountered by the mine were also a motivation to convert the thermal ice storage system. Converting an ice storage facility to a <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> <b>system</b> for energy efficiency on a deep level gold mine Energy management is achieved through the monitoring, controlling and reporting of the implemented savings approach. Converting the glycol plant and recommissioning the chilled water plant gave the mine an additional chiller as backup to sufficiently meet underground demand.

It is concluded that conversion of the thermal ice storage system on Mine M results in an energy- and cost saving. Master...|$|E

Whereas in the past, the relatively compact <b>Chilled</b> <b>Water</b> <b>system</b> could be tucked away where space was available, the higher demand for chilled water has resulted in a potentially exponential growth in size and weight of the components which make up this system; as a result, the design of the cooling systems must be considered earlier in the design process.

HaslerThis paper {{discusses}} {{the advantages of}} applying a utility centralized <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> <b>system</b> as the district cooling choice for facilities in the high-density urban areas of China {{and how it will}} influence China’s development in the next decades. Presently, the Chinese government is trying to contribute to the world’s energy-saving goals as well as determine its sustainable development framework. As air pollution {{has become one of the}} main problems in China, indoor air quality (IAQ) is likely to gain priority as a building design consideration in the future. Consistent with this fact, this paper proposes an optimum HVAC system for cooling purposes to the Chinese government. Compared to unitary HVAC systems, the centralized HVAC system has significant advantages in system efficiency, energy reduction and cost savings and can, therefore, be a better choice. Furthermore, the paper will focus on the centralized <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> <b>system</b> and demonstrate why they better match the development model in China. The application of the system in high-density urban areas will also be discussed. Due to a lack of understanding that the energy consumption of unitary systems, the first comparison presented is between unitary HVAC systems and centralized HVAC systems in individual buildings. The comparison presented will focus on the energy-saving benefits of the centralized HVAC system in individual buildings and its contribution to sustainable development. Consequently, prescribing a centralized <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> <b>system</b> as a utility district cooling system and applying a centralized <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> <b>system</b> to each individual building in the highdensity urban areas will be compared.

40|$|The {{extensive}} use of air conditioning for indoor cooling in offices and large commercial buildings in Kuwait represents {{a major part of}} the power and electricity consumption in that country. The main objective of this research was to investigate ice and <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> cool thermal storage technologies and operating strategies for air conditioning. This was motivated by the extreme climatic conditions in Kuwait and the necessity to reduce both maximum power demand and energy consumption whilst being economically feasible. This work represents the first such study undertaken. In Kuwait approximately 45 % of the total annual exported electrical energy is consumed solely by air conditioning systems as a result of the very high ambient temperatures occurring between March and October. Furthermore, it was estimated air conditioning systems represent about 62 % of the peak electrical load. To assess the potential of cool thermal storage, the air conditioning system for an existing clinic building, representing a typical medium size building in Kuwait, was designed with and without a cool thermal storage system. The results demonstrate that internal ice-on-coil and <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> storage <b>systems</b> are suitable storage technologies that can be implemented in Kuwait. The cooling demand of the clinic building was first estimated using the ESP-r building energy simulation program, following which the different components in the air conditioning systems were sized including chiller, storage tanks, pumps, air handling units for conventional, ice and <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> storage air conditioning systems operating with load levelling, 50 % demand limiting and full storage strategies. The heat gains by different auxiliary components in the air conditioning systems were estimated and the final cooling demand profiles were developed. For each air conditioning design, the power and energy consumption for the design day condition and over the whole year were calculated and analysed. Furthermore, the life cycle costs were determined based on the estimated capital, maintenance, operating costs and a financial analysis was carried out. For the Kuwaiti climate, the results demonstrate ice and <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> storage <b>systems</b> can reduced the maximum power consumption during the day time when the electricity demand is high and largest reduction in the maximum power achieved full storage strategy. However, the energy consumption of ice storage system operating with 50 % demand limiting and full strategies were found were found to be higher than the conventional air conditioning system. Nevertheless, the energy consumption in the ice storage system with a load levelling operating strategy was slightly lower. <b>Chilled</b> <b>water</b> storage <b>system</b> was found to be unlike ice storage system, the energy consumption in all operating strategies improved over the conventional system. Based on the estimated life cycle cost using the actual operating costs for both the government and user, it was established that for the government, ice storage operating with load levelling strategy and all other strategies of the <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> storage <b>systems</b> would be more economical than conventional systems. However, for the user, load levelling ice storage, load levelling <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> storage, and 50 % demand limiting <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> storage <b>systems</b> would be more cost effective. Out of all alternatives, <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> storage <b>system</b> with a load levelling strategy was found to be the most cost effective for the climate of Kuwait and for similar climates of Kuwait. Although, the outcome from this research work can not be generalised however, the method of sizing and energy and economic analysis, which was discussed in this thesis can be generalised and followed to evaluate the impact of cool thermal storage systems on energy performance and economy of the air conditioning systems.
