5|$|Originally, {{the rocks}} in which Carnotaurus was found were {{assigned}} to {{the upper part of the}} Gorro Frigio Formation, which was considered to be approximately 100 million years old (Albian or <b>Cenomanian</b> <b>stage).</b> Later they were realized to pertain to the much younger La Colonia Formation, dating 72 to 69.9 million years ago (Late Cretaceous, Lower Maastrichtian stage). Thus, Carnotaurus was the latest South American abelisaurid known. By the Late Cretaceous, South America was already isolated from both Africa and North America.|$|E
5|$|The stones used to {{backfill}} the quarry are those which underlie the Givetian limestone extracted in the Bellignies quarry. There is , a coarse shelly limestone, deep gray, yellowish when it outcrops, detrital ferruginous dated to the Lower Cenomanian epoch, {{a hundred million}} years ago. There is clay and very glauconitic marl of the Upper <b>Cenomanian</b> <b>stage,</b> enriched by a pebble conglomerate paléozoïc stones. These rocks contain Praeactinocamax plenus, Chlamys asper, Ostrea diluviana and radiated fossils: Janira quadricostata, Cyprina ligeriensis, Arca mailleana.

50|$|Mawsonia is an extinct genus {{of prehistoric}} {{coelacanth}} fish, {{and the largest}} of this group, up to several meters long. It lived during the Cretaceous period (Albian and <b>Cenomanian</b> <b>stages,</b> about 99 to 112 million years ago). Fossils {{have been found in}} Africa and South America.

50|$|Hamadasuchus is an extinct genus of sebecian crocodylomorph. Fossils {{have been}} found from the Kem Kem Formation {{outcropping}} in southeastern Morocco.

Diagnostic features of the genus include its lateromedially compressed and serrated teeth. It was deep-snouted and had a slightly heterodont dentition with three distinct tooth morphologies present from sections of the lower jaw.|$|R
5000|$|Sonorasaurus is a genus of brachiosaurid dinosaur {{from the}} middle Cretaceous (Albian to <b>Cenomanian</b> <b>stages,</b> around 112 to 93 million years ago). It was a herbivorous sauropod whose fossils {{have been found in}} {{southern}} Arizona in the United States. Its name, which means [...] "Sonora lizard", comes from the Sonoran Desert where its fossils were first found. It is estimated to have been about 15 meters long (49 ft) and 8.2 m tall, about one third of the size of Brachiosaurus.|$|R
5000|$|Aegyptosaurus [...] meaning 'Egypt’s lizard', for {{the country}} in which it was {{discovered}} (Greek sauros meaning 'lizard') is a genus of sauropod dinosaur believed to have lived in what is now Africa, around 95 million years ago, during the mid- and late-Cretaceous Period (Albian to <b>Cenomanian</b> <b>stages).</b> Like most sauropods, it had a long neck and a small skull. The animal's long tail probably acted as a counterweight to its body mass. Aegyptosaurus was a close relative of Argentinosaurus, a much larger dinosaur found in South America.|$|R

50|$|The Aoufous Formation {{was first}} {{reported}} by Dubar (1948) {{as part of}} the “Sillon Preafricain”. Dubar described it from a lithological point of view as consisting mainly of clay-sandstones and green marls with gypsum. Dubar dated the sediments to the Albian / <b>Cenomanian</b> <b>stages.</b> Later, Sereno et al. (1996) reported an informal division of the Kem Kem Beds: a lower red sandstone unit ("gres infrecenomanien") and an upper marley unit ("marne versicolores a gypse"). Because of the absence of hiatuses between and within the three formations, the represented time scale is of around 8 million years, covering the time from the Early Cenomanian to the Middle Turonian. The Aoufous Formation is exposed from the Anti-Atlas and High Atlas mountain ranges up to the Sahara craton, in the southeastern part of Morocco.|$|R
50|$|These fossil {{remains were}} {{discovered}} in the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation in the eastern portion of the U.S. state of Utah. This section of the formation is believed to represent the late Albian through early <b>Cenomanian</b> <b>stages</b> of the Late Cretaceous Period, or about 106 to 97 million years ago. At least 80 other vertebrate species are known from the Mussentuchit, including fish, frogs, lizards, snakes, crocodilians, dinosaurs, birds, and mammals, although not all are complete enough to name. Many dinosaur groups are represented by fossils from this member, including carnivorous theropods {{as well as several}} different herbivorous types, including the iguanodont Eolambia. The presence of aquatic animals like fish and frogs, as well as the mudstone in which their fossils are found, suggests that this was a floodplain environment.|$|R

5|$|Palynology (the {{study of}} pollen), {{as well as}} studies of fossil megaflora and invertebrates, had {{initially}} suggested that the uppermost Cedar Mountain Formation – including the Mussentuchit – dated to the Albian stage. A 1997 argon-argon dating of sanidine crystals recovered from a volcanic ash layer in the upper Cedar Mountain Formation by Cifelli and colleagues indicated an age of 97 ± 0.1 million years, which was then considered to be just after {{the boundary between the}} Albian and <b>Cenomanian</b> <b>stages.</b> This is similar to the early Cenomanian age reported for the overlying Dakota Formation. Subsequently, in 2007, James Garrison and colleagues dated the volcanic ash layer passing through the Cifelli #2 Quarry – which is likely the same layer dated previously by Cifelli and colleagues – to 96.7 ± 0.5 million years ago. At an approximate level, the Cifelli and Garrison estimates agree with each other, thus indicating a Cenomanian age for Eolambia. Garrison and colleagues also re-analyzed the pollen assemblage from localities throughout the Mussentuchit, concluding that the assemblage spans the Albian-Cenomanian boundary.|$|R

5000|$|The type specimens, cotypes GSM 109045-GSM 109058, {{were found}} in the Chalk Group, a {{formation}} itself dating to the Albian to <b>Cenomanian</b> <b>stages</b> around 100 million years ago.. The specimens consist of three teeth, a basicranium, a dorsal vertebra, spikes and scutes.In 1869 Harry Govier Seeley named several new species of the genus based on remains from the Cambridge Greensand: Acanthopholis macrocercus, based on specimens CAMSM B55570-55609; Acanthopholis platypus (CAMSM B55454-55461); [...] and Acanthopholis stereocercus (CAMSM B55558 55569). Later, Seeley split the material of Acanthopholis stereocercus and based a new species of Anoplosaurus on part of it: Anoplosaurus major. He also described a new species, Acanthopholis eucercus, on the basis of six caudal vertebrae (CAMSM 55552-55557). In 1902 however Franz Nopcsa changed it into another species of Acanthopholis: Acanthopholis major. Nopcsa at the same time renamed Anoplosaurus curtonotus into Acanthopholis curtonotus. In 1879 Seeley named the genus Syngonosaurus based on part of the type material of A. macrocercus. In 1956 Friedrich von Huene renamed A. platypus into Macrurosaurus platypus.|$|R
5000|$|The Winton Formation is a paralic to terrestrial/freshwater deposit [...] that is {{remnant of}} a vast network of river {{floodplains}} that drained northward into the Eromanga Sea in the late Albian to <b>Cenomanian</b> <b>stages</b> of the Cretaceous period. The deposit is up to 1.2 km thick in south west Queensland and becomes thinner as it extends north toward Winton due to both erosion and original distribution. The Winton Formation thins out just north of Winton due to regional dip and the semicircular outcrop pattern of the Eromanga Basin. Winton Formation overlies the older marine deposits of the Mackunda Formation. The Mackunda Formation represents {{the final phase of}} the inland sea that receded from the Winton area approximately 100-98 million years ago. The bones of [...] "Elliot" [...] and [...] "Wade" [...] were discovered 80 km north-east of Winton and were deposited very close to the shores of the retreating inland sea. The Winton Formation has produced the remains of more large dinosaurs than the rest of Australia combined making it the country’s most extensive and prolific dinosaur deposit.|$|R

50|$|The eroded {{sandstone}} {{landscape of}} this region was formed from depositions that accumulated {{on the bottom of}} the sea millions of years ago. Large rivers carried sand and other eroded debris into the Cretaceous sea. Rough quartz sand, clay and fine marl sank and became lithified layer by layer. A compact sandstone sequence developed, about 20 x 30 kilometres wide and up to 600 metres thick dating to the lower <b>Cenomanian</b> to Santonian <b>stages.</b> The tremendous variety of shapes in the sandstone landscape is a result of the subsequent chemical and physical erosion and biological processes acting on the rocks formed from those sands laid down during the Cretaceous Period.|$|R
