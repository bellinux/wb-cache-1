5|$|Charles Darwin {{mentioned}} evolutionary {{interactions between}} flowering plants and insects in On the Origin of Species (1859). The term <b>coevolution</b> was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964. The theoretical underpinnings of <b>coevolution</b> are now well-developed, and demonstrate that <b>coevolution</b> {{can play an}} important role in driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that <b>coevolution</b> influences the structure and function of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.|$|E
5|$|Each {{party in}} a coevolutionary {{relationship}} exerts selective pressures on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. <b>Coevolution</b> includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between species, as well as competition within or between species. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms race between the species involved. Pairwise or specific <b>coevolution,</b> between exactly two species, {{is not the only}} possibility; in guild or diffuse <b>coevolution,</b> several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another species, as has happened between the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.|$|E
5|$|Both {{intraspecific}} competition, {{with features}} such as sexual conflict and sexual selection, and interspecific competition, such as between predators, {{may be able to}} drive <b>coevolution.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Coevolution</b> is {{primarily}} a biological concept, but {{has been applied to}} other fields by analogy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Coevolution</b> is {{primarily}} a biological concept, but researchers have applied it by analogy to fields such as computer science, sociology, and astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Computer {{software}} and hardware {{can be considered as}} two separate components but tied intrinsically by <b>coevolution.</b> Similarly, operating systems and computer applications, web browsers and web applications.|$|E
5|$|In biology, <b>coevolution</b> {{occurs when}} {{two or more}} species {{reciprocally}} affect each other's evolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} <b>coevolution</b> listed {{so far have}} been {{described}} as if they operated pairwise (also called specific <b>coevolution),</b> in which traits of one species have evolved in direct response to traits of a second species, and vice versa. This is not always the case. Another evolutionary mode arises where evolution is still reciprocal, but is among a group of species rather than exactly two. This is called guild or diffuse <b>coevolution.</b> For instance, a trait in several species of flowering plant, such as offering its nectar {{at the end of a}} long tube, can coevolve with a trait in one or several species of pollinating insects, such as a long proboscis. More generally, flowering plants are pollinated by insects from different families including bees, flies, and beetles, all of which form a broad guild of pollinators which respond to the nectar or pollen produced by flowers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Co{{evolution}}</b> is {{the evolution}} {{of two or more}} species which reciprocally affect each other, sometimes creating a mutualistic relationship between the species. Such relationships can be of many different types.|$|E
5|$|<b>Coevolution</b> theory : Viruses {{may have}} evolved from complex {{molecules}} of protein and DNA {{at the same}} time as cells first appeared on earth and would have depended on cellular life for many millions of years.|$|E
5|$|Predators and prey {{interact}} and coevolve, the predator {{to catch the}} prey more effectively, the prey to escape. The <b>coevolution</b> of the two mutually imposes selective pressures. These often lead to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in antipredator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} his first {{detailed}} demonstration {{of the power of}} natural selection, and explained how complex ecological relationships resulted in the <b>coevolution</b> of orchids and insects. The view has been expressed that the book led directly or indirectly to all modern work on <b>coevolution</b> and the evolution of extreme specialisation. It influenced botanists, and revived interest in the neglected idea that insects played a part in pollinating flowers. It opened up the new study areas of pollination research and reproductive ecology, directly related to Darwin's ideas on evolution, and supported his view that natural selection led to a variety of forms through the important benefits achieved by cross-fertilisation. Although the general public showed less interest and sales of the book were low, it established Darwin as a leading botanist. Orchids was {{the first in a series}} of books on his innovative investigations into plants.|$|E
5|$|The remarkably {{successful}} Hymenoptera {{appeared as}} long as 146 million {{years ago in the}} Cretaceous period, but achieved their wide diversity more recently in the Cenozoic era, which began 66 million years ago. A number of highly successful insect groups evolved in conjunction with flowering plants, a powerful illustration of <b>coevolution.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{locations}} where both snake and salamander co-exist, the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they {{feed on the}} amphibians with impunity. <b>Coevolution</b> occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities {{at the same rate}} as the snake further develops its immunity. Some frogs and toads are toxic, the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back. These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms. Altogether, over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{were among}} the {{earliest}} terrestrial herbivores and acted as major selection agents on plants. Plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects, in turn, evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins. Many insects make use of these toxins {{to protect themselves from}} their predators. Such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors. This successful evolutionary pattern has also been used by mimics. Over time, this has led to complex groups of coevolved species. Conversely, some interactions between plants and insects, like pollination, are beneficial to both organisms. <b>Coevolution</b> has {{led to the development of}} very specific mutualisms in such systems.|$|E
5|$|Modern insect-pollinated (entomophilous) {{flowers are}} conspicuously coadapted with insects to ensure {{pollination}} {{and in return}} to reward the pollinators with nectar and pollen. The two groups have coevolved for over 100 million years, creating a complex network of interactions. Either they evolved together, or at some later stages they came together, likely with pre-adaptations, and became mutually adapted. The term <b>coevolution</b> was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964, to describe the evolutionary interactions of plants and butterflies.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago. No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms {{over the next}} few billion years. The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 billion years ago. The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent <b>coevolution,</b> with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms {{led to the formation of}} chloroplasts in algae and plants.|$|E
5|$|The parasite/host {{relationship}} probably {{drove the}} prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient asexual reproduction. It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual reproduction affords {{a better chance of}} developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction, which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite. <b>Coevolution</b> between host and parasite may accordingly be responsible for much of the genetic diversity seen in normal populations, including blood-plasma polymorphism, protein polymorphism, and histocompatibility systems.|$|E
5|$|Two {{comprehensive}} {{histories of}} Engelbart's laboratory and work are in What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry by John Markoff and A Heritage of Innovation: SRI's First Half Century by Donald Neilson. Other books on Engelbart and his laboratory include Bootstrapping: Douglas Engelbart, <b>Coevolution,</b> and the Origins of Personal Computing by Thierry Bardini and The Engelbart Hypothesis: Dialogs with Douglas Engelbart, by Valerie Landau and Eileen Clegg {{in conversation with}} Douglas Engelbart. All four of these books are {{based on interviews with}} Engelbart as well as other contributors in his laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} demonstrates close <b>coevolution</b> of {{host and}} parasite, {{for example in}} cuckoos. These birds do not make their own nests, but lay their eggs in nests of other species, ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong {{negative impact on the}} host's reproductive fitness. Their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts, implying that hosts can distinguish their own eggs from those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition. Cuckoos are counter-adapted to host defences with features such as thickened eggshells, shorter incubation (so their young hatch first), and flat backs adapted to lift eggs out of the nest.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{set out a}} {{detailed}} study of common descent with modifications by expanding {{on the theme of}} <b>coevolution</b> between local populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in On the Origin of Species. He examined numerous ways in which orchids vary, showing how they had diverged and developed specialised pollen-dispersal mechanisms. The intricate morphology and anatomy of each flower was carefully described. Apparently trivial details were examined in relation to natural selection to demonstrate how slight variations in similar structures of closely related flowers led to specialised modifications that provided various pollinators (insects) with different ways to cross-fertilise. The mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement, but the result is demanding to read.|$|E
5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of <b>coevolution</b> to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E
5|$|Interactions between organisms {{can produce}} both {{conflict}} and cooperation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, {{such as a}} pathogen and a host, or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called <b>coevolution.</b> An example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough-skinned newt {{and the evolution of}} tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the common garter snake. In this predator-prey pair, an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin resistance in the snake.|$|E
5|$|The {{two-fold}} cost of sex {{was first}} described by John Maynard Smith. The first cost {{is that in}} sexually dimorphic species {{only one of the}} two sexes can bear young. (This cost does not apply to hermaphroditic species, like most plants and many invertebrates.) The second cost is that any individual who reproduces sexually can only pass on 50% of its genes to any individual offspring, with even less passed on as each new generation passes. Yet sexual reproduction is the more common means of reproduction among eukaryotes and multicellular organisms. The Red Queen hypothesis has been used to explain the significance of sexual reproduction as a means to enable continual evolution and adaptation in response to <b>coevolution</b> with other species in an ever-changing environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} animal-pollinated {{flowers were}} shallow, cup-shaped blooms pollinated by insects such as beetles, so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established {{before the first}} appearance of bees. The novelty is that bees are specialized as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. In a process of <b>coevolution,</b> flowers developed floral rewards such as nectar and longer tubes, and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar. Bees also developed structures known as scopal hairs and pollen baskets to collect and carry pollen. The location and type differ among and between groups of bees. Most bees have scopal hairs located on their hind legs or {{on the underside of}} their abdomens, some bees in the family Apidae possess pollen baskets on their hind legs while very few species lack these entirely and instead collect pollen in their crops. This drove the adaptive radiation of the angiosperms, and, in turn, the bees themselves. Bees have not only coevolved with flowers but it is believed that some bees have coevolved with mites. Some bees provide tufts of hairs called acarinaria that appear to provide lodgings for mites; in return, it is believed that the mites eat fungi that attack pollen, so the relationship in this case may be mutualistc.|$|E
5|$|The natural diets {{of snakes}} in the {{widespread}} viper genus Echis are highly varied, and include arthropods, such as scorpions, {{as well as}} vertebrates. Various Echis species consume different quantities of arthropods in their diet. A study carried out in 2009 injected scorpions with the venom of various Echis species, and found a high correlation between the proportion of arthropods that the snakes consumed in their natural habitat, and the toxicity of their venom to scorpions. The researchers also found evidence that the evolution of venom more toxic to arthropods was related {{to an increase in}} the proportion of arthropods in the snakes' diet, and that diet and venom may have evolved by a process of <b>coevolution.</b> A phylogeny of the genus constructed using mitochondrial DNA showed that one instance of a change in venom composition in the species ancestral to all Echis snakes was correlated with a shift to an arthropod based diet, whereas another shift in a more recent lineage was correlated with a shift to a diet of vertebrates. Despite the higher toxicity of the venom of arthropod-consuming species, it was not found to incapacitate or kill prey any faster than that of species with fewer arthropods in their diet. Thus, the venom is thought to have evolved to minimize the volume required, as the production of venom carries a significant metabolic cost, thus providing a fitness benefit. This pattern is also found in other lineages. Similar results were obtained by a 2012 study which found that the venom of arthropod-consuming Echis species was more toxic to locusts than that of vertebrate-consuming species.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coevolution</b> is {{a process}} in which two or more species {{influence}} the evolution of each other. All organisms are influenced by life around them; however, in <b>coevolution</b> there is evidence that genetically determined traits in each species directly resulted from the interaction between the two organisms.|$|E

25|$|Gene–culture <b>coevolution</b> was {{developed}} to explain how human behavior {{is a product of}} two different and interacting evolutionary processes: genetic evolution and cultural evolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} ecologist Dr. Daniel Janzen {{began to}} explicate {{the idea of}} ecological fitting with a 1980 paper that observed that many instances of ecological interactions were inferred {{to be the result}} of <b>coevolution</b> when this was not necessarily the case, and encouraged ecologists to use the term <b>coevolution</b> more strictly. He observed that the existing defense traits of plants were likely produced by co-evolution with herbivores or parasites that no longer co-occurred with the plants, but that these traits were continuing to protect the plants against new attacks.|$|E
25|$|In 1981 after {{collaborating with}} Charles Lumsden, he {{published}} Genes, Mind and Culture, {{a theory of}} gene-culture <b>coevolution.</b> In 1990 he published The Ants, co-written with Bert Hölldobler, his second Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.|$|E
25|$|Another S. thermophilus {{experiment}} {{showed that}} phages can infect and replicate in hosts that {{have only one}} targeting spacer. Yet another showed that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres. The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (<b>co)evolution.</b>|$|E
25|$|Later studies support <b>coevolution</b> in that dogs can {{discriminate}} {{the emotional}} expressions of human faces, {{and that most}} people can tell from a bark whether a dog is alone, being approached by a stranger, playing, or being aggressive, and can tell from a growl how big the dog is.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coevolution</b> of a mutualistic {{system in}} New World tropics between species of Acacia (Mimosoideae; Leguminosae), v. gr., Acacia cornigera, and the ant Pseudomyrmex ferruginea (Formicidae). Acacia spp in the Neotropics are {{protected}} by ants against defoliation; for this, the ants are rewarded by means of special organs and physiology that Acacia has evolved.|$|E
25|$|The ritual/speech <b>coevolution</b> {{theory was}} {{originally}} {{proposed by the}} distinguished social anthropologist Roy Rappaport before being elaborated by anthropologists such as Chris Knight, Jerome Lewis, Nick Enfield, Camilla Power and Ian Watts. Cognitive scientist and robotics engineer Luc Steels is another prominent supporter of this general approach, as is biological anthropologist/neuroscientist Terrence Deacon.|$|E
25|$|Such <b>coevolution</b> {{does not}} imply that the ants and the tree choose to behave in an altruistic manner. Rather, across a {{population}} small genetic changes in both ant and tree benefited each. The benefit gave a slightly higher chance of the characteristic being passed on to the next generation. Over time, successive mutations created the relationship we observe today.|$|E
