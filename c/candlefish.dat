This falls rapidly apart as the <b>Candlefish</b> sinks, with one survivor [...] - [...] Jack Hardy [...] - [...] injured and washed overboard from the conning tower. As the story concludes, <b>Candlefish</b> risks being unleashed on an unsuspecting Japan in 1974.|$|E
50|$|The 1972 book Ghostboat {{was set in}} 1974, and {{revolved}} around the re-appearance of the Pacific Fleet class Submarine 284 USS <b>Candlefish,</b> thirty years after it disappeared in the Devil's Sea in the Pacific off the Kuriles, toward Japan. The <b>Candlefish</b> surfaces {{in the path of}} a Japanese freighter 600 miles northwest of Pearl Harbor. The characters and their names remain basically the same (e.g. Alan Cassidy is Walter Cassidy, Travis is Frank Crook) and the mission to re-trace {{the last days of the}} <b>Candlefish</b> has no undercurrent of intrigue.|$|E
50|$|The {{eulachon}} (Thaleichthys pacificus), also oolichan, hooligan, ooligan, or <b>candlefish,</b> {{is a small}} anadromous ocean fish, a smelt found {{along the}} Pacific coast of North America from northern California to Alaska.|$|E
50|$|In the {{original}} story <b>Candlefish</b> fell through a Geo-magnetic Anomaly (GMA), one of ten, {{five in the}} Northern Hemisphere, five in the Southern; and surfaced {{in the middle of}} another. The plot is concerned not so much with how the submarine came back, but why it came back.|$|E
50|$|Dungeness crab, {{clams and}} {{flatfish}} are abundant. In the past, strong salmon runs passed {{through on the}} way to the rivers on the mainland, but they have all but disappeared as have the once plentiful bait of <b>candlefish</b> and herring. Most of the fishing in southern end of Whidbey Island takes place on the western side, in Possession Sound, Mutiny Bay, or Double Bluff.|$|E
5000|$|The Nechako (/nəˈtʃækoʊ/) River {{was once}} the {{greatest}} tributary of the Fraser River, [...] and the watershed {{was used by the}} Carrier people. For centuries the Cheslatta T'en hunted, fished and trapped there and were part of an ancient trade network called the Grease Trail. The grease was actually eulachon oil. from the oolichan, or <b>candlefish,</b> a fatty Pacific coast smelt. The oil was a highly prized commodity grease trail and was carried in bentwood boxes that would often leak. It was named the Alexander Mackenzie Voyageur Route, then renamed the Nuxalk-Carrier Grease Trail to honour the guides. with the Nuxalk and Chilcotin.|$|E
5000|$|Originally, the Chilkat {{group of}} Tlingit {{controlled}} the trail, which they used for {{trade with the}} Athabascan people of the interior. They called the trail [...] "grease trail" [...] after the eulachon oil (extracted from the tiny <b>candlefish)</b> {{that was the most}} important item of trade on the Chilkoot side. Each Tlingit chief had an exclusive Athabascan trading partner. Tlingits took eulachon oil and returned with furs, hides and copper nuggets gathered by the Athabascans. Trading parties often lasted a month or more and often consisted of as many as 100 men, each of whom would carry a 45 kg (100 pound) load.|$|E
50|$|Consistently small {{stockpiles}} of foodstuffs at Fort Astoria created {{the need for}} frequent transactions with Chinookans for sustenance. Seasonal fish runs provided the major nutritional sources for the Columbian River based Natives. After ceremonial rituals during each major fish run, trade for caught fish would begin in earnest with the Astorians. A constant task for Hawaiians would be to perform fisherman duties. Major fish populations active in the Columbia included the <b>Candlefish</b> smelt, White sturgeon, Sockeye salmon and Chinook salmon. This dependence on fish made it a primary food source for the Astorians, which caused some discontent among employees desiring a more familiar diet.|$|E
50|$|The term panfish or pan-fish {{has been}} used to refer {{to a wide range of}} edible {{freshwater}} and saltwater fish species that are small enough to cook in a small pan. In American Food and Game Fishes. A Popular Account of All The Species Found In America North Of The Equator, With Keys For Ready Identification, Life Histories And Methods of Capture - Jordan and Evermann (1908) they identify all the following as panfish in some form or another: Yellow Perch, <b>Candlefish,</b> Balaos, Sand Launces, Rock Bass, Bullheads, Minnows, Rocky Mountain Whitefish, Sand Rollers, Crappie, Yellow Bass, White Bass, Croaker and of course most of the common small sunfishes such as bluegill and redear sunfish.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the Europeans, gifts {{included}} storable food (oolichan, or <b>candlefish,</b> oil or dried food), canoes, slaves, and ornamental [...] "coppers" [...] among aristocrats, but not resource-generating assets such as hunting, fishing and berrying territories. Coppers were sheets of beaten copper, shield-like in appearance; they were about two feet long, wider on top, cruciform frame and schematic face on the top half. None of the copper used was ever of indigenous metal. A copper was considered the equivalent of a slave. They were only ever owned by individual aristocrats, and never by numaym, hence could circulate between groups. Coppers began to be produced in large numbers after the colonization of Vancouver Island in 1849 when war and slavery were ended.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sablefish}} (Anoplopoma fimbria) {{is one of}} {{two members}} of the fish family Anoplopomatidae and the only species in the Anoplopoma genus. In English, common names for it include sable (USA), butterfish (USA), black cod (USA, UK, Canada), blue cod (UK), bluefish (UK), <b>candlefish</b> (UK), coal cod (UK), coalfish (Canada), beshow, and skil(fish) (Canada), although many of these names also refer to other, unrelated, species. In the USA, the FDA accepts only [...] "sablefish" [...] as the Acceptable Market Name; [...] "black cod" [...] is considered a vernacular (regional) name and should not be used as a Statement of Identity for this species. The sablefish is found in muddy sea beds in the North Pacific at depths of 300 to 2,700 m and is commercially important to Japan.|$|E
