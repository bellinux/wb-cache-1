40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the possibility of}} direct punishment by specialized enforcers into a model of <b>community</b> <b>enforcement.</b> Specialized enforcers need to be given incentives to carry out costly punishments. Our main result shows that, when the specialized enforcement technology is suf-ciently e¤ective, cooperation is best sustained by a single enforcer punishment equilibrium, where any deviation by a regular agent is punished only once, and only by enforcers. In con-trast, enforcers themselves are disciplined (at least in part) by <b>community</b> <b>enforcement.</b> The reason why there is no <b>community</b> <b>enforcement</b> following deviations by regular agent is that such actions, by reducing future cooperation, would decrease the amount of punishment that enforcers are willing to impose on deviators. Conversely, when the specialized enforcement tech-nology is ine¤ective, optimal equilibria do punish deviations by regular agents with <b>community</b> <b>enforcement.</b> The model thus predicts that societies with more advanced enforcement technolo-gies should rely on specialized enforcement, while less technologically advanced societies should rely on <b>community</b> <b>enforcement.</b> Our results hold both under perfect monitoring of actions and under various types of private monitoring...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a field experiment conducted among mollusk harvesters {{in a community}} on the Pacific Coast of Colombia. The experiment {{is based on a}} standard linear public good and consists of two stages. In the first stage we compare the ability of monetary and nonmonetary sanctions among community members to increase contributions to the public good. In the second stage we add a government regulation with either a high or low sanction for noncompliance to <b>community</b> <b>enforcement</b> efforts. The results for the first stage are consistent with other comparisons of monetary and nonmonetary sanctions within groups; both led to higher contributions. The results from the second stage reveal that government regulations always complemented <b>community</b> <b>enforcement</b> efforts. While the subjects tended to reduce their sanctioning efforts under the government regulations, contributions and earnings were significantly higher than without government interventions. In fact, the combination of <b>community</b> and government <b>enforcement</b> efforts generated near-perfect contributions to the public good.

30|$|Of {{particular}} {{relevance to}} the use of the enforcement approach is Almeida and Aterido (2008) which developed a proxy for locally varying enforcement, again based on the Enterprise Surveys. The main <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> used were the numbers of visits by labor or tax inspectors. In their empirical model, they include both their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> (visits by inspectors) and in one specification also its interaction with the country-level rigidity of labor regulations. Their results show that enforcement by itself has a negative effect on the probability of formal training but that its interaction with labor law rigidity has a positive and significant effect. Two possible shortcomings, however, would seem to be (1) that no allowance is given to a direct effect of labor law rigidity on training (or the firm’s perceived severity of these regulations as in the “obstacles approach) and (2) the possible endogeneity or selection bias in their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure.</b>|$|R

40|$|Cooperative Spectrum sharing can {{be thought}} of as a {{reorganization}} of rights between stakeholders [2]. The principal stakeholders are the Primary User (PU), who holds the spectrum license, and the Secondary User(s) who uses the spectrum temporarily. Any rights management system requires a set of strategies and technologies to enforce the rights [3]; the timing of the enforcement action (ex-ante and ex-post) also plays a significant role [4]. The cooperative spectrum sharing approaches that have been proposed by the NTIA emphasize ex-ante actions, which are designed to prevent a PU’s signal from harmful interference that could occur by the SU [1, 5]. A comprehensive enforcement framework would include protecting the rights of the SU in addition to having an ex post component that can efficiently and effectively adjudicate claims of interference. Determining the role of ex-post enforcement in a spectrum sharing scheme is of significant importance since cooperative spectrum sharing will without doubt result in interference events. To evaluate the role of the ex-post enforcement approach, a hypothetical scenario of using the recommended protection zones and the involved entities will be used to analyze the current <b>enforcement</b> timing <b>measures</b> and to evaluate the usage of ex-post-only <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures.</b> The hypothetical scenario concerns about the behaviors of the SUs, if SU-mobile devices transmitting near PU-base station or transmitting with high power signal within the protection zone. This behavior will cause harmful interference to the PU signal and data received by the PU will be lost. To guarantee SU behavior the suggested ex-ante and ex-post <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> will be explained and analyzed. Then, ex-post-only <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> will be applied to this scenario and analyzed. The purpose of analyzing the ex-post-only <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> is to evaluate how these measures might work, and what the limits are on their effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|Park {{officials}} at Carara National Park, Costa Rica, face considerable challenges. They believe poaching {{has become a}} significant threat to the park’s biodiversity and that their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures,</b> largely due to limited funds, are inadequate. Through family-level interviews in six communities surrounding Carara National Park, this study aims to understand the dynamics of poaching by identifying animals at risk of poaching and identifying communities to target future <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures.</b> Interviews inquired about interactions with wildlife, perceived populations of wildlife, sale of wildlife, opinions towards hunting, and observed hunting activities. Summary statistics, CART modeling and probit regressions are {{used to analyze the}} data. Results indicate hunting is not prevalent {{in terms of the number}} of families that hunt. However, these families can still have significant impacts on wildlife populations with poaching occurring for both subsistence and market-oriented reasons. Two potential community sets are identified as areas to target enforcement. Based on the number of reported families engaging in hunting, enforcement should be targeted in Bijagual and Tárcoles. However, exploring truthfulness through CART and probit regression analysis indicates enforcement should be targeted in El Sur and La Hacienda. Ultimately, future <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> will be determined by Carara officials. Although potential target communities are identified and management practices such as ecotourism and community-based management are potentially viable avenues for reducing poaching, the park faces considerable challenges for enforcement due to its limited financial capabilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine factors that influence the success of community based marine protected areas in North Sulawesi Indonesia. The research took place in North Sulawesi Province of Indonesia. A multi-methods approach was used including administration of a survey questionnaire to a random sample of household respondents, use of secondary data, key informant interviews and direct observations within the field sites. Results demonstrate that community-based management interventions and community responses are complex and varied. Progress in establishing community-based marine protected areas was related to community context and the amount and type of project interventions provided. The role of community organizers was also an influencing factor. Compliance with resource management and conservation rules was related to the distance of the reef area to a settlement. Effective <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> can be tailored to the type of violator and the type of rules. Local rules can be effectively enforced when the violator is from the <b>community.</b> <b>Enforcement</b> is more difficult when the violator is from outside the village.

Community development interventions {{play an important role in}} promoting successful conservation strategies. The dynamic nature of the human ecology of coastal communities defies any form of highly predictive cause and effect linkages assumed in most project logic models Since complexity is inherent in the human component of the ecosystem, the uncertainty of human responses to management interventions requires an adaptive and ecosystems-based management approach. ...|$|R
