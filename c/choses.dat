The signatories were concerned with guarding the king's honour {{and the rights of}} the Crown (garder son honeur et les dreits de sa Corounne). There was also a promise to address and correct both the things that had been done against that honour and those rights, as well as the past and present oppression of the people (les <b>choses</b> que sont feites avant ces houres countre soen honour et le droit de sa Coronne, et les oppressiouns que ount estre feit et uncore se fount de jour en jour a soen people). Nothing is said about what specifically these things were, but it must be assumed that the target was Gaveston. Bek was given the authority to excommunicate whoever broke the terms of the agreement.|$|E

25|$|The {{conception}} that {{an action}} for conversion lies only for tangible property {{capable of being}} identified and taken into actual possession {{is based on a}} fiction by which the action of trover was founded, namely, that the defendant had found the property of another, which was lost. This conception has become, in the progress of the law, something without meaning which has been discarded by most courts. Therefore, it has been generally accepted that an action for conversion lies for every species of personal property which is the subject of private ownership, whether animate or inanimate. Intangible property can be the subject of a conversion in the United States. There cannot be an action in conversion for <b>choses</b> in action or mere debt. Computer software can be the subject of a conversion.|$|E

25|$|Finally, after Deleuze, René Girard {{included}} {{his account}} of sado-masochism in Things Hidden Since the Foundation of The World, originally Des <b>choses</b> cachées depuis la fondation du monde, 1978, making the chapter on masochism a coherent part of his theory of mimetic desire. In this view of sado-masochism, {{the violence of the}} practices are an expression of a peripheral rivalry that has developed around the actual love-object. There is clearly a similarity to Deleuze, since both in the violence surrounding the memory of mimetic crisis and its avoidance, and in the resistance to affection that is focused on by Deleuze, there is an understanding {{of the value of the}} love object in terms of the processes of its valuation, acquisition and the test it imposes on the suitor.|$|E
25|$|She headlined the 1993 erotic thriller Sliver, {{based on}} the Ira Levin novel {{of the same name}} about the mysterious occurrences in a privately owned New York City {{high-rise}} apartment building. The film was heavily panned by critics and earned Stone a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress, but became a commercial success, grossing US$116.3 million at the international box office. She made a cameo appearance in the action film Last Action Hero (1993), starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. In 1994, she starred opposite Richard Gere and Lolita Davidovich in the drama Intersection, directed by Mark Rydell. The film, a remake of the French film Les <b>choses</b> de la vie (1970) by Claude Sautet, concerns an architect (played by Gere) who as his car hurtles into a collision at an intersection, flashes through key moments in his life, including his marriage to a beautiful but chilly heiress (Stone) and his subsequent affair with a travel writer (Davidovich). Intersection received negative reviews and flopped at the box office.|$|E

500|$|Scholars such as Catherine Rottenberg {{examine how}} Larsen’s {{characters}} struggle against {{race and gender}} norms of [...] "whiteness" [...] in the United States. Rottenberg shows how the main characters in the novel confront normative characteristics of white culture. Clare, who is of mixed race, <b>choses</b> {{to identify with the}} white culture. Irene, who identifies as an African American, <b>choses</b> to pass when she feels the need to blend into white culture. The essence of Rottenberg's scholarship shows how the novel's characters struggle against the desire for whiteness because of the positive stereotypes society has created around [...] "white" [...] identity. Clare's experience growing up with her white aunts, who treated her as a servant, directly impacts Clare's initial desire towards whiteness. Hence, she passes as a white woman, marries a white man, and forgets her African American culture. Even though as a society the white race is the desirable race, Rottenberg explains how there are limitations put into place so the inferior race can never fully be white. [...] For example, Clare has this desire to pass as a white woman because she believes that is the only way she will have a social power, but after reconnecting with her childhood friend Irene, she begins to struggle with her misplaced desire for whiteness and returns to her African American identification. Seeing Irene sparks a desire in Clare to get back in touch with her African American culture. Similarly, Irene identifies as black, but because she desires to feel safe and in control at all times in her life , she chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene's desire to be white comes from her wanting the middle-class lifestyle because it will give her the security she needs. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation, which in a way, makes her feel like her marriage and the life she knows at risk. Throughout Larsen's novel Rottenberg explains how Clare has evolved from wanting to achieve whiteness to reconnecting with the African American culture, while Irene still has a desire to achieve [...] "whiteness" [...] for the feel secure.|$|E
500|$|Ellie {{lost her}} mother at birth {{and grew up}} in an orphanage. She later attends a {{military}} boarding school in the Boston quarantine zone, where she befriends Riley Abel, a fellow rebel who protects her from bullies, as depicted in the comic book series [...] During the events of Left Behind, which take place several weeks before the beginning of The Last of Us, Riley returns to Ellie after a long absence and tells her that she has joined the Fireflies, a revolutionary militia group. While spending time together at an abandoned shopping mall near the quarantine zone, Riley reveals that she is about to be posted to another city, and Ellie hesitantly supports her decisions. Riley abandons her Firefly pendant when Ellie pleads for her to remain. In response, she impulsively kisses Riley who happily responds. Drawn by the noise of their activities, the Infected pursues Ellie and Riley. They attempt to escape, but are bitten. The pair considers suicide, but <b>choses</b> to spend their final hours together. However, Ellie survives the infection and seeks help from Marlene, the leader of the Fireflies. She agrees to escort Ellie as she tries to find a cure thanks to her immunity to the Infected. Marlene is later wounded, and early in The Last of Us, assigns Joel the task of escorting Ellie.|$|E
