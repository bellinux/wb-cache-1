Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current.

A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current.

40|$|We present {{new data}} on {{genotypic}} differences and biogeographic distribution of <b>coiling</b> <b>types</b> {{in the living}} planktonic foraminiferal morphospecies Neogloboquadrina pachyderma. The genetic evidence demonstrates that coiling direction in N. pachyderma is a genetic trait, heritable through time, {{and is not a}} morphological feature reflecting ecophenotypic variation. The two opposite coiling morphotypes appear to have diverged during the late Miocene, and they have distinctly different ecologies. In combination with fossil evidence, biogeography, and ecology the degree of genetic distinction between the two <b>coiling</b> <b>types</b> of N. pachyderma strongly implies that they should be considered different species. We propose the adoption of the widely recognized name N. incompta for the right coiling morphospecies. The genetic evidence also demonstrates a low level (< 3 %) of aberrant coiling associated with both morphotypes. The abundance of these aberrant specimens has no relationship with the environment. These findings have important consequences for the use of N. pachyderma and N. incompta as paleoceanographic signal carriers in polar and subpolar waters.

50|$|In either type, the stylus itself, usually of diamond, {{is mounted}} on a tiny metal strut called a cantilever, which is {{suspended}} using a collar of highly compliant plastic.

In either case, the movement of the stylus as it tracks the grooves of a record causes a fluctuating magnetic field which causes a small electric current to be induced in the coils. This current closely follows the sound waveform cut into the record, and may be transmitted by wires to an electronic amplifier where it is processed and amplified in order to drive a loudspeaker. Depending upon the amplifier design, a phono-preamplifier may be necessary.|$|E

40|$|Subthreshold {{continuous}} theta burst {{stimulation of}} the visual cortex {{has been reported to}} cause inhibitory effects on phosphene threshold. In contrast, we observed no inhibition in a former study applying higher stimulation intensities. The main discrepancies between our experiments and the former studies were stimulation intensity and <b>coil</b> <b>type.</b> We aimed at investigating the role of these factors on the modulatory effects of continuous theta burst stimulation applied to the visual cortex. In a between-group-design, we used either a figure-of-eight-coil or a round coil, respectively. We measured phosphene thresholds prior and after continuous theta burst stimulation applied at 80 % of individual phosphene threshold. With the figure-of-eight-coil, phosphene thresholds significantly decreased following stimulation. This is in line with the results of our former study but contrary to the increase observed in the other two studies. Using a round coil, no significant effect was observed. A correlation analysis revealed an inhibitory effect in subjects with higher phosphene thresholds only. Furthermore, the slope of the baseline phosphene threshold seems to predict the direction of modulation, independent from <b>coil</b> <b>type.</b> Thus, modulatory effects of continuous theta burst stimulation seem to depend on <b>coil</b> <b>type</b> and psychophysics parameters, probably due to different cortex volumes stimulated.
