5000|$|The {{system is}} {{significantly}} {{more complex than}} its previous Hot Pursuit incarnations. The {{manner in which the}} police handle a player is now determined by the [...] "heat level" [...] of the player's current <b>car.</b> <b>Heat</b> levels, which increase with the length of a police pursuit and the amount of damage caused by the player during the pursuit, add a twist to the pursuit. The higher the car's heat level, the more aggressive the police units are against the player, employing additional tactics and tools, such as roadblocks, spike strips, police helicopters and heavier and faster police cars such as police SUV's and Federal units.|$|E
5000|$|On the 33rd <b>car,</b> <b>heat</b> {{began to}} build up in an improperly-lubricated journal bearing {{on one of the}} wheels, one of the few still in use at that time as most had long since been {{replaced}} with roller bearings, resulting in the condition known among train workers as a [...] "hot box". Residents living beside the tracks reported smoke and sparks coming from the car, and those who were close to Mississauga thought the train was afire. The friction eventually burned through the axle and bearing, and as the train was passing the Burnhamthorpe Road level crossing, a wheelset (one axle and pair of wheels) fell off completely.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the first {{results of a}} research project dealing {{with the development of}} a reversible heat pump for a passenger <b>car.</b> <b>Heat</b> pump systems appear to be a more efficient alternative to electrical resistance heaters for the purpose of heating the car indoor environment. Heat pump systems could be easily implemented into cars by allowing the air-conditioning system to run in reverse. In order to check the technical feasibility of a reversible heat pump system, and to point out technical barriers, a prototype was built and tested. Experimental data was also used to calibrate and validate simulation models of components. A heat pump system model was finally built to investigate the operating conditions of the system. The first part of the paper describes the test rig (architecture, components, and measurement devices) and the experimental campaign. Performance of components (compressor, evaporator, condenser and heater core) is evaluated in terms of variation with the operating conditions. The second part of the paper presents the steady-state semi-empirical models of the components. Such lumped models retain and concentrate the main physical phenomena inherent to the components into successive elementary processes (pressure losses, heat transfers, etc.). They require a limited number of parameters that can be identified based on experimental data. The calibration and the validation of the proposed component models are detailed. Finally, an overall simulation model of the reversible heat pump system is proposed and used to evaluate the energy performance of the system as function of the operating conditions.

50|$|When steam {{locomotives}} {{began to}} be retired from passenger runs, Gold's company, {{now known as the}} Vapor <b>Car</b> <b>Heating</b> Company, developed a compact water-tube boiler that could be fitted into the rear of a diesel locomotive's engine room.

30|$|Since humans usually emit {{more heat}} than other objects like trees, background, or road artifacts, the thermal shape can be often {{successfully}} exploited for pedestrian detection. In such cases, pedestrians {{are in fact}} brighter than the background. Unfortunately, other road participants or artifacts emit <b>heat</b> as well (<b>cars,</b> <b>heated</b> buildings, etc.). Moreover, infrared images are blurred and have a poor resolution and the contrast is low compared with rich and colorful visible images.|$|R
25|$|The steam {{generated}} in the boiler not only propels the locomotive, but also energizes other devices such as whistles, brakes, pumps and passenger <b>car</b> <b>heating</b> systems. The constant demand for steam requires a continuous supply of water to the boiler, usually pumped in automatically. The source of this water is an unpressurised tank that is usually part of the locomotive's tender or is wrapped around the boiler {{in the case of}} a tank locomotive. Periodic stops are required to refill the water.|$|R

40|$|The {{pervasive}} {{integration of}} digital technology in traditionally physical {{products such as}} <b>cars,</b> <b>heat</b> pumps, and washing machines calls for revisiting the received innovation literature. To this end, this paper presents a competing logic framework for understanding digital technology in product innovation management. In doing this, we derive two idealized innovation regimes by distinguishing and assessing two broad streams of innovation research across the dimensions of organizing logic, market dynamics, and architectural design. Recognizing and elaborating inherent tensions between product innovation and IT innovation, the framework identifies a range of new challenges with implications for digital innovation management research and practice...|$|R
50|$|When diesel {{locomotives}} {{were introduced to}} passenger service, they were equipped with steam generators to provide steam for <b>car</b> <b>heating.</b> However, the use of axle generators and batteries persisted for many years. This started {{to change in the}} late 1950s, during which time the Chicago and North Western Railway removed the steam generators from their EMD F7 and E8 locomotives in commuter service and installed diesel generator sets (see Peninsula 400). This was a natural evolution, as their commuter trains were already receiving low-voltage, low-current power from the locomotives to assist axle generators in maintaining battery charge.|$|R

Compared to laminar flows turbulent ones have a higher skin-friction drag due to the Reynolds stresses. The aim of drag reduction techniques consists in inhibit turbulence and thus erase the effect of Reynold stresses. There are lots of drag reduction techniques either passive like riblets or active like peristalsis. Peristalsis consists in a travelling wall-deformation wave which has obtained drag reduction up 40 % on the simulations. The present work tries to verify experimentally the results obtained on the simulations concerning peristalsis technique...|$|R
50|$|The high {{capacity}} of the port and coal handling rate are achieved thanks to utilization of specialized equipment at each stage of the operation.

Efficient storage is ensured by specialized equipment, consisting of four reclaimers, two stackers, bulldozers and loaders.

50|$|During {{the winter}} months, {{electric}} heaters under the seats provided plenty of heat. P. Smith heaters were used on cars 2400-2599, and a Gold <b>Car</b> <b>Heating</b> {{model for the}} rest of the fleet. In warmer weather, vents in the roof accommodated the influx of fresh air from outside the car. Three different vent types were used on Standards: grill type (2000-2499), box type (2500-2599), and clerestory type (2600-2899, 4000-4049). In addition, riders could open the drop sash side windows for extra ventilation. Initially made from wood (2000-2599), on later cars they were brass (2600-2899, 4000-4049). After early complaints about the summer warmth of the cars, ceiling paddle fans were added during the 1919-1920 modifications. Later Standards came already equipped with fans.|$|R

50|$|Using {{standardized}} wheels {{with precision}} ball bearings, modern gravity-powered racers start at a ramp {{on top of}} a hill, attaining speeds of up to 35 miles per hour. Rally races and qualifying races in cities around the world use advanced timing systems that measure the time difference between the competing cars to the thousandth of a second to determine the winner of a heat. Each heat of a race lasts less than 30 seconds. Most races are double elimination races where a racer that loses a heat can work their way through the Challenger's Bracket in an attempt to win the overall race. The annual World Championship race in Akron, however, is a single elimination race which uses overhead photography, triggered by a timing system, to determine the winner of each heat.
