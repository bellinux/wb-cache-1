5|$|In February 1974, the British Prime Minister, Edward Heath, {{advised the}} Queen {{to call a}} general {{election}} {{in the middle of}} her tour of the Austronesian Pacific Rim, requiring her to fly back to Britain. The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.|$|E
5|$|At their 2007 meeting, the BCHL {{board of}} {{governors}} rejected moving the Williams Lake TimberWolves to Dawson Creek, but then voted to allow the move if the Burnaby Express (who was also seeking relocation) moved to Fort St. John. However, the Society {{was not able to}} recruit sufficient support in Fort St. John to form an ownership group and the Burnaby Express re-arranged its management and ownership so that it <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Burnaby. The Williams Lake TimberWolves, after one year of dormancy, relocated to Wenatchee, Washington. Efforts at relocating an Alberta Junior Hockey League team were also unsuccessful as no team expressed interest in moving at that time.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen people, {{including}} Taylor, {{were eventually}} indicted in {{the assassination of}} Governor Goebel. Three accepted immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony. Only five ever went to trial, two of those being acquitted. Convictions were handed down against Taylor's Secretary of State Caleb Powers, Henry Youtsey, and Jim Howard. The prosecution charged that Powers was the mastermind, having a political opponent killed so that his boss, Governor Taylor, <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> office. Youtsey was an alleged intermediary, and Howard, who {{was said to have}} been in Frankfort to seek a pardon from Taylor for the killing of a man in a family feud, was accused of being the actual assassin.|$|E

5|$|Originally, historians {{believed}} that Edward's decision to rebuild {{much of the}} castle {{was in response to}} the growing tensions with France; in this version of events, Hadleigh would have formed an importance coastal fortification along the Thames estuary, protecting it from French raids. Current historical opinion plays down this motivation, noting {{that at the time of}} the work on Hadleigh relations with France were unusually good. Instead, it is suspected that the increasing elderly Edward intended Hadleigh more as a personal retreat close to London, where he <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> privacy and considerable comfort. Whilst the entrance on the inland side remained relatively basic, the building work created a grander impression from the estuary – any visitors to London, English or French, would have passed by Queenborough Castle on the south bank and Hadleigh on the north, the combination communicating a strong sense of royal power.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} in Scotland continued {{as a civil}} war. Lord Moray was assassinated on 23 January 1570. The regent who succeeded him, the Earl of Lennox, was also a victim of violence. On 30 April 1571, the controller of Edinburgh Castle, Kirkcaldy of Grange, ordered all enemies of the Queen to leave the city. But for Knox, his former friend and fellow galley-slave, he made an exception. If Knox did not leave, he <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Edinburgh, but only if he remained captive in the castle. Knox chose to leave, and on 5 May he left for St Andrews. He continued to preach, spoke to students, and worked on his History. At the end of July 1572, after a truce was called, he returned to Edinburgh. Although by this time exceedingly feeble and his voice faint, he continued to preach at St Giles'.|$|E
5|$|The {{money that}} Callum won from the casino is missing, and Samantha finds it with Jenny {{and her husband}} Dean (Tom Pelphrey), after they stole it. Jenny and Dean are brought into {{question}}ing; however Jenny tells Megan that Callum was giving it to her, to go on an art course. Samantha talks to Frank again, but when they question him about Irina {{but he does not}} know her. They find out that Irina was Callum's nurse, for his arthritis and that Callum was going to help Irina get her son from Belgrade to the US. Irina confesses that she did cut up Callum, but did not kill him. Irina found Callum dead, so cut him up so that she could forge the last immigration document to get her son to her as Callum had not finished it. Irina tells Megan where the head is, and they find a fracture on his head. Megan and Samantha go back to Callum’s apartment, and Megan demonstrates why Irina couldn’t have killed Callum due to the mark on the wall being too high to be Irina. Megan traces metal to Callum's landlord, Mike Walsh (Kelly AuCoin). Samantha infers that because Cal was under rent control, Mike killed him so a paying client <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the apartment. Meanwhile, Lacey Fleming (Mary Mouser) asks if she can go to Megan's work, for a school project. Lacey arrives, and speaks with Dr. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), discussing her work. Lacey tries to get Kate to allow her to see the body, however she refuses. Lacey speaks to Ethan, Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) and later Megan, who shows her pictures of bodies, telling her about her job.|$|E

25|$|Before {{accession}} to the European Union, Croatia was categorised as an Annex II country, {{which meant that}} Croatian citizens <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the Schengen Area without a visa for up to 90 days in a 180-day period. Croatian citizens were also able to stay without a visa in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ireland and Romania for up to 90 days in each country, {{as well as in}} the United Kingdom for up to 6 months.|$|E
25|$|Many Sioux {{continued}} {{to cross the}} border to seek refuge. Sitting Bull did not arrive in Wood Mountain until May 1877 when he and his band of 135 lodges crossed into Canada. While camping in White Mud Creek, Sitting Bull and his party were met by North West Mounted Police officers commanded by Major James Morrow Walsh. They were told that they <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Canada as long as they abided the laws and did not cross the border to raid the United States.|$|E
25|$|Relations in {{the family}} Magnoliaceae have been puzzling taxonomists for a long time. Because the family is quite old and has survived many {{geological}} events (such as ice ages, mountain formation, and continental drift), its distribution has become scattered. Some species or groups of species have been isolated for a long time, while others <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> close contact. To create divisions {{in the family}} (or even within the genus Magnolia), solely based upon morphological characters, {{has proven to be}} a nearly impossible task.|$|E

25|$|When {{he was in}} his 60s, Eliot {{wrote that}} he was {{immature}} and timid at the time, and was probably in love with Emily Hale, a Bostonian he had had a relationship with in the United States. What he wanted from Haigh-Wood, he said, was a flirtation. But a meeting with the American poet Ezra Pound had persuaded him that the pursuit of poetry was possible, and marrying Haigh-Wood meant he <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> England and avoid Harvard. Eliot told a friend, Conrad Aiken, that he wanted to marry and lose his virginity.|$|E
25|$|The {{refugees}} {{were transferred to}} the cruise ship Neuralia, which had been taken into war service. The Czechs looked to smuggle Ant between the two ships by hiding him in a kit bag. This failed as the dog pushed {{his head out of}} the bag just as they were boarding – fortunately for Ant the new crew seemed happy to have a dog on-board and welcomed him. The facilities on Neuralia were much better than Northmoor, as the cabins remained fitted out as a cruise ship and Ant <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the cabin with the men. The remainder of the voyage went smoothly, until Bozděch was informed about the quarantine rules for dogs upon entering the United Kingdom. Having no money with which to pay for the quarantine fees, the Czechs sought once again to smuggle him – this time into the UK. They elected to hide Ant once again in a bag, this time mixed up in those being transferred as cargo by crane. They arrived at the docks in Liverpool on 12 July, where they successfully took Ant ashore. They were nearly found out by a pair of military police as they were at the train station nearby as {{they were on their way}} to Cholmondeley, Cheshire.|$|E

[...] On April 28, Giuliani held a news conference to announce that he did in fact have prostate cancer, but it was in an early stage. [...] He was unsure of which of several types of treatment he might undergo, and that decision would impact whether he <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the senate race or not. [...] Hanover was not present at the conference, but issued a note saying she would support him in his decision process.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Travis Fickett of IGN {{said this}} and other recent episodes are [...] "proving that the show has plenty of life in it and [...] The Office has still got it." [...] He said the funniest element of the show was the emerging [...] "bro-mance" [...] between Dwight and Andy. Will Leitch of New York magazine said, [...] "The Office kind of needed this sort of shake-up, even if it’s {{something as simple as}} another room to put all our characters in." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said he liked the plot aspects involve the new company, particularly the pancake breakfast and the first successful sales call: [...] "I know the series probably has to revert to something like the old status quo at some point, but I almost wish it <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> that dank little corner a little longer." [...] Phipps, who gave the episode a B+ grade, said the [...] "rundown" [...] subplot between Jim and Charles was a bit strained by the end. Steven Mullen of The Tuscaloosa News called the episode [...] "stellar" [...] and particularly praised the comedic chemistry between Andy and Dwight.|$|E
500|$|The Spitfire {{also served}} in the Pacific Theatre where the Spitfire met its match in the Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero. Lt.Gen. Claire Lee Chennault noted: [...] "The RAF pilots were trained in methods that were {{excellent}} against German and Italian equipment, but suicide against the acrobatic Japs." [...] Although not {{as fast as the}} Spitfire, the Zero could out-turn the Spitfire with ease, could sustain a climb at a very steep angle, and <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the air for three times as long. To counter the Zero, Spitfire pilots had to adopt a [...] "slash and run" [...] policy and use their superior speed and diving superiority to fight while avoiding classic dogfights. It also did not help that Southeast Asia was a lower-priority area which was allocated few Spitfires and other modern fighters compared to Europe, which allowed the Japanese to easily achieve air superiority by 1942. Over the Northern Territory of Australia, RAAF and RAF Spitfires helped defend the port town of Darwin against air attack by the Japanese Naval Air Force, suffering heavy losses largely due to the type's limited fuel capacity. Spitfire MKVIIIs took part in the last battle of World War II involving the Western allies, in Burma in the ground attack role, helping defeat a Japanese break-out attempt.|$|E
500|$|In early September 2001, ZANU–PF militants again {{attempted}} to force Smith off his farm. The former Prime Minister telephoned the provincial Governor, who promptly sent police {{to remove the}} invaders. According to Smith, the trespassers were shocked to hear the authorities were taking his side, and left before the police even arrived. Half a year later, Smith lost his Zimbabwean passport {{as a result of}} further tightening of the law regarding multiple citizenship. New legislation passed in 2001 required Zimbabwean citizens to disavow any claim to other nationalities, even if they did not hold foreign passports. Insisting that Mugabe's government had no right to strip him of Zimbabwean citizenship, Smith refused to renounce his right to British nationality, though he had not held a UK passport for years. Zimbabwean authorities duly refused to renew Smith's passport in March 2002. State press reported that he had [...] "automatically ceased to be a citizen of Zimbabwe" [...] on the passport's expiry, having failed to renounce British citizenship before a deadline on 8 January that year. Smith claimed that his Zimbabwean citizenship had been illegally revoked and that he was now stateless, an assertion disputed by the Minister of Home Affairs John Nkomo, who said that Smith <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the country, but would not receive a new Zimbabwean passport until he renounced his right to British nationality.|$|E

500|$|In the 1951–52 NBA season, the NBA {{decided to}} widen the foul lane under the basket from 6 feet to 12 feet. As players <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the lane for only three seconds at a time, it forced big men like Mikan to post-up from double the distance. A main proponent of this rule was New York Knicks coach Joe Lapchick, who {{regarded}} Mikan as his nemesis, and it was dubbed [...] "The Mikan Rule". While Mikan still scored an impressive 23.8 points per game, it was a serious reduction from his 27.4 points per game the previous season, and his field goal percentage sank from [...]428 to [...]385. He still pulled down 13.5 rebounds per game, asserting himself as a top rebounder, and logged 3.0 assists per game. Mikan also had a truly dominating game that season, in which he scored a personal-best 61 points in a double overtime victory against the Rochester Royals. At the time, it was the second-best performance in league history behind Joe Fulks' 63-point score in 1949, and Mikan's output more than doubled that of his teammates, whose output that game totaled 30 points. In the 1952 NBA All-Star Game, Mikan had a strong performance with 26 points and 15 rebounds in a West loss. Later that season, the Lakers reached the 1952 NBA Finals and were pitted against the New York Knicks. This qualified {{as one of the}} strangest Finals series in NBA history, as neither team could play on their home court in the first six games. The Lakers' Minneapolis Auditorium was already booked, and the Knicks' Madison Square Garden was occupied by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Instead, the Lakers played in St. Paul and the Knicks in the damp, dimly lit 69th Regiment Armory. Perpetually double-teamed by Knicks' Nat Clifton and Harry Gallatin, Mikan was unable to assert himself and it was more Vern Mikkelsen's credit that the first six games were split. In the only true home game, Game 7 in the Auditorium, the Lakers won 82–65 and edged the Knicks 4–3, winning the NBA title and earning themselves $7,500 to split among the team.|$|E
