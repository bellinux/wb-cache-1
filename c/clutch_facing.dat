40|$|Phenolic {{friction}} composite (PFC) of the non-woven type <b>clutch</b> <b>facing</b> {{was made}} from whole asbestos yam and zinc wire cored asbestos yarn, by dipping in rn-phenol based formaldehyde resin. The moulding was performed at a temperature of 140 'C and was post-cured for 2 h. The coefficient of friction of the PFC showed {{a decrease in the}} 3 rd to 4 th cycle when testing was performed at an interface temperature of 250 °C. Gravimetric analysis showed some loss in weight when the unpost-cured PFC was exposed to 300 °C. This was attributed to the presence of moisture and the volatile materials formed from the decomposed ingredients. Similar phenomenon was expected to occur when the coefficient of friction testing performed at higher temperatures. It was shown that the moisture increases the coefficient of friction, whereas, the volatiles decrease it and even prevents the effect of moisture. Extending the post-curing time to 4 h helps in elimination of this slippage behaviour and marginally improves many desirable properties.

40|$|The {{developers}} of innovative automotive active systems have recently stimulated new interest toward {{the analysis of}} the frictional behaviour of brake and clutch facings. This paper presents the experimental results acquired with a laboratory setup on brake and <b>clutch</b> <b>facing</b> samples in sliding motion for different operating conditions.

40|$|The {{tribological}} contact under sliding {{condition in}} the <b>clutch</b> <b>facing</b> surfaces during the engagement manoeuvre is strongly affected by heat transfer {{occurring in the}} system. The frictional forces acting on the contact surfaces produce mechanical energy losses which are converted in heat with ensuing temperature increase. Reports about the temperature rise after repeated clutch engagements prove the occurrence of interface temperature peaks as high as 300 °C. Unfortunately, only few papers address their focus towards experiments and their outcomes {{about the influence of}} temperature and the other operating parameters on the frictional behaviour of the <b>clutch</b> <b>facing</b> materials. In this paper, the Authors mainly explored the frictional behaviour modification for thermal level higher than 250 – 300 °C, whose effect is a sharp decline of the friction coefficient related to the decomposition of the phenol resin of the facings. Moreover, this phenomenon induces not expected transition from dry friction to mixed dry-lubricated friction which explains the reasons of the friction coefficient drop. The temperature affects also the cushion spring load-deflection characteristic and the ensuing transmitted clutch torque. Thus, an original frictional map has been implemented in a control algorithm to estimate the heat flux during vehicle launch and up-shift manoeuvres. The results of the longitudinal vehicle dynamics has been used in a FEA to predict the temperature field during repeated clutch engagement on the contact surfaces. The simulation results prove that during each engagement the interface temperature increases of 30 – 35 °C. This means that after only few repeated clutch engagements the temperature field could reach values near the critical point of 300 °C. In such a way, this paper aims at providing useful references to control engineers in order to improve the dry-clutch transmissions performances...|$|E
40|$|The {{tribological}} contact under sliding {{condition in}} <b>clutch</b> <b>facing</b> surfaces during engagement manoeuvres is strongly affected by heat transfer {{occurring in the}} system. The frictional forces acting on contact surfaces produce mechanical energy losses which are converted in heat with ensuing temperature increase. In this paper, in order to estimate the error due by neglecting the effective spatial distribution of heat flux the Authors explored the thermal generation in a dry clutch architecture during a vehicle launch manoeuvre. The results of the longitudinal vehicle dynamics {{have been used in}} a FEA to evaluate how the spatial distribution of heat flux influences the temperature field of contact surfaces. To this aim, simulations obtained by considering the same engagement manoeuvre but under different hypothesis, i. e. linearly dependable with disc radius and uniform heat flux have been compared. The results showed that the estimated thermal field in dry clutch components changes by varying hypothesis. In particular, in the first case the interface temperature is higher than the second one and the difference could grow with repeated engagements leading to underestimate the thermal stress of clutch components. In such a way, this paper aims at providing useful references to design and control engineers in order to improve the dry-clutch transmissions performances...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Non-asbestos organic {{composite}} friction {{materials are}} increasingly used in auto-motive brake disc pads and <b>clutch</b> <b>facing</b> applications. Loss in braking effectiveness at elevated temperatures (300400 C) because of reduction in friction coefficient () and {{the revival of}} the same at lower temperatures is referred to as fade and recovery, respectively. The present paper deals with the role of binary combination of volcanic rock fibers (either basalt or Lapinus) and organic fibers (either aramid or PAN) on the fade and recovery behavior of friction composites. The fade–recovery behavior of four composites was evaluated following ECE R- 90 regulation. The -performance, -fade, and -recovery were significantly influenced by the type of fiber combinations. It was observed that among the rock fibers, basalt was more effective to boost the performance than the Lapinus. In the case of organic fibers, aramid was more effective than the PAN in this aspect. The Lapinus fiber-based composites showed higher resistance to wear and friction-fade than the composites based on basalt fiber. The aramid and Lapinus fibers imparted higher resistance to fade and wear than the PAN and basalt fibers, whereas the overall recovery response of the PAN fiber-based composites was higher than the others. Worn surface analysis by SEM has proved to be useful in understanding the wear behavior of the composites. KEY WORDS: fade, recovery, friction material, nao brake-pad material...|$|E
