40|$|The diploma thesis {{suggests}} a producing {{plan of the}} <b>cover</b> <b>nut</b> using cold forming technology. The component will {{be made of the}} structural steel 11 320 5 R. Size of its assumed annual production is 800 000 pieces. The best option was chosen from four suggested production versions. A wire with a diameter of 13. 2 mm was designed as a semi-product. The component will be made in four forming operations. Roll forming machine TPM 8 (produced by Šmeral Brno) with a nominal force of 1000 kN was elected for the proposed manufacturing technology. Drawing documentation was elaborated, which includes drawing of the rolling tool assembly and drawing of tools for 3 rd operation (backward extrusion). The results of the economic evaluation shows that the production cost of one nut is 1 CZK...|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} shows {{results of a}} {{calculation}} of carbon footprint (CFP) resulting from the production of nuts added value products for a large consumer market. Nuts consumption is increasing {{in the world and}} so is the consumer awareness of the environmental impact of goods, hence the calculation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of food production is of growing importance for producers. Calculation of CO 2 eq emissions was performed for all stages of the production chain to the final retail point for flour, grains, paste, chocolate <b>covered</b> <b>nuts</b> and spreadable cream produced from almonds, pistachios and hazelnuts grown and transformed in Italy and for peanuts grown in Argentina and transformed in Italy. Data from literature was used to evaluate CFP of raw materials, emissions from transport and packing were calculated using existing models, while emissions deriving from transformation were calculated empirically by multiplying the power of production lines (electrical and/or thermal) by its productivity. All values were reported in kg of CO 2 equivalent for each kg of packed product (net weight). Resulting values ranged between 1. 2 g of CO 2 /kg for a 100 g bag of almond to 4. 8 g of CO 2 /kg for the 100 g bag of chocolate covered almond. The calculation procedure can be well used for similar cases of large consumer food productions...|$|R

40|$|Land cover {{identification}} from {{remote sensing}} images by using automatic methods has been essential for agricultural management and monitoring. In particular, accurate detection of lands <b>covered</b> with <b>nuts</b> orchards from VHR images {{is an ongoing}} challenge mainly due to varying statistics of orchards, such as crown sizes, overlapping crowns, distances between the orchards, existence of different tree species and surface structure. An innovative approach, becomingmore popular everyday to overcome similar problems, is to merge spectral and spatial information for utilizing their advantages. In this paper, we propose a self-organizing map that exploits these two information without additional computation of texture. Experimental results on detection of hazelnut orchards from Quickbird imagery show that the proposed method outperforms methods based only on spectral or on spatial information. JRC. DDG.

30|$|In 1999, {{the direct}} {{internal}} use of steel bracing system in concrete frame was studied in laboratory.

Results showed, depending upon various connectors’ component, the bracing system considerably increases the equivalent stiffness of the frame and notably changes its behavior. When the bracing system’s connector is implanted inside concrete, the performance of frame gets even better and further energy is absorbed. Generally, experiments demonstrated that the bracing system tolerates {{a major part of}} lateral load in reinforced concrete frame (Tasnimi and Masoumi 1999).|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{focused on}} {{fabrication}} of areca fiber extraction machine. This is basically removing fiber from areca husk. The areca husk is outer <b>cover</b> of areca <b>nut</b> {{which consists of}} fiber. These fibers are being extracted manually. This has several problems such has time consuming, low production rate, human error, low quality fiber, more workers and skilled labours. This paper aims {{to overcome these problems}} by fabricating areca fiber extraction machine which automates the fiber extraction process. This machine consists of 3 phase ac motor which is directly coupled to driven shaft. The driven shaft is enclosed in a casing which is designed {{in such a way that}} only dust is removed and fiber comes out of rectangular duct at lower side of casing. The driven shaft is supported by two bearings and has blades which are designed by modifying the blade design of coconut husk decorticating machine. Thus this machine will be helpful for rural entrepreneurs and farmers. Keywords—Areca fiber, Blade, Extraction machine. I...|$|R

5000|$|When {{pressed steel}} wheels became common by the 1940s, these were often painted {{the same color}} as the car body. Hubcaps {{expanded}} in size to <b>cover</b> the lug <b>nuts</b> that were used to mount these steel wheels. An option on some cars was a chrome-plated trim ring that clipped onto the outer rim of the wheel, in addition to the center hubcap. The full wheel cover became popular that covered the entire wheel. These became increasingly decorative in styles and were typically made from chrome-plated or stainless steel. Basic automobiles came standard with simple, unadorned, and inexpensive hubcaps were called [...] "poverty caps" [...] or [...] "dog dish caps" [...] due to their size and shape. Various optional full wheel covers of various designs were optional or were standard equipment on higher trim models. Metal hubcaps not only help protect lug nuts (that hold the wheel on) from corrosion, but also offer an audible warning should a wheel nut work their way off. During the 1960s and 1970s, automakers also offered stainless steel spoke full wheel covers that simulated the look of traditional, and more costly, wire spoke wheels.|$|R

Results showed that minimum threshold temperatures for <b>covered</b> larvae in <b>nut</b> to 50 % pupation, bare larvae to 50 % pupation and larvae within nut and 50 % pupation to 50 % adult emergence according to X-intercept method were 7. 69 °C, 7. 78 °C, 9. 52 °C and 11. 14 °C, respectively. In the case of least coefficient of variation method, the values were 7. 92 °C, 7. 59 °C, 9. 81 °C and 11. 99 °C. Thermal constant for occurrence of 50 % adult emergence and 50 % pupation from overwintering larvae and from 50 % pupation to 50 % adult emergence and 5 % adult emergence to 50 % adult emergence with minimum threshold temperatures of 9. 5 °C, 8 °C, 11 °C and 11 °C under laboratory conditions were 783 ± 17. 03, 609 ± 1. 7, 215. 3 ± 19. 05 and 107, respectively, which, except for the last case, they were far different from the thermal constant under field conditions.
