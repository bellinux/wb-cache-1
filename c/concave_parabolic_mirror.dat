25|$|Scallops have a {{large number}} (10–100) of small (about 1mm) eyes {{arranged}} {{along the edge of}} their mantle. These eyes represent a particular innovation among molluscs, relying on a <b>concave,</b> <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> of guanine crystals to focus and retro-reflect light instead of a lens as found in many other eye types. Additionally, their eyes possess a double-layered retina, the outer retina responding most strongly to light and the inner to abrupt darkness. While these eyes are unable to resolve shapes with high fidelity, the combined sensitivity of both retinas to light entering the eye and light retro-reflected from the mirror grants scallops exceptional contrast definition as well as the ability to detect changing patterns of light and motion. Scallops primarily rely on their eyes as an 'early-warning' threat detection system, scanning around them for movement and shadows which could potentially indicate predators. Additionally, some scallops alter their swimming or feeding behavior based on the turbidity or clarity of the water, by detecting the movement of particulate matter in the water column.|$|E

40|$|Automated imaging systems {{offer the}} {{potential}} to inspect the quality and safety {{of fruits and vegetables}} consumed by the public. Current automated inspection systems allow fruits such as apples to be sorted for quality attributes such as weight, color, and size based on imaging a portion of the surface of each fruit. However, to ensure the inspected fruits are free of defects and contamination, the whole surface of each fruit must be imaged. The goal of this project was to develop an economical module capable of providing whole surface imaging of apples using mirrors and a single camera. Different configurations of flat and concave mirrors were examined and their ability to approach 100 % of an apple's surface were characterized and compared.

50|$|It {{makes use}} of the special {{properties}} of parabolic and hyperbolic reflectors. A <b>concave</b> <b>parabolic</b> reflector will reflect all incoming light rays parallel to its axis of symmetry to a single point, the focus. A convex hyperbolic reflector has two foci and will reflect all light rays directed at one of its two foci towards its other focus. The mirrors {{in this type of}} telescope are designed and positioned so that they share one focus and so that the second focus of the hyperbolic mirror will be at the same point at which the image is to be observed, usually just outside the eyepiece. The <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> reflects parallel light rays entering the telescope to its focus, which is also the focus of the hyperbolic mirror. The hyperbolic mirror then reflects those light rays to its other focus, where the image is observed.|$|R

Conversely, a point source at {{the focus of a}} <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> will produce a beam of collimated light creating a Collimator. Since the source needs to be small, such an optical system cannot produce much optical power. Spherical mirrors are easier to make than <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors</b> and they are often used to produce approximately collimated light. Many types of lenses can also produce collimated light from point-like sources.|$|R

40|$|Focusing with a 4 π <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> {{allows for}} concentrating light from nearly the {{complete}} solid angle, whereas focusing {{with a single}} microscope objective limits the angle cone used for focusing to half solid angle at maximum. Increasing the solid angle by using deep <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors</b> comes {{at the cost of}} adding more complexity to the mirror's fabrication process and might introduce errors that reduce the focusing quality. To determine these errors, we experimentally examine the focusing properties of a 4 π <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> that was produced by single-point diamond turning. The properties are characterized with a single ^ 174 Yb^+ ion as a mobile point scatterer. The ion is trapped in a vacuum environment with a movable high optical access Paul trap. We demonstrate an effective focal spot size of 209 nm in lateral and 551 nm in axial direction. Such tight focusing allows us to build an efficient light-matter interface. Our findings agree with numerical simulations incorporating a finite ion temperature and interferometrically measured wavefront aberrations induced by the <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror.</b> We point at further technological improvements and discuss the general scope of applications of a 4 π <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror...</b>|$|R

40|$|A gated {{spectrometer}} {{has been}} designed for real-time, pulsed infrared (IR) studies at the National Synchrotron Light ource at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. A pair of 90 -degree, off-axis <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors</b> are used to relay the light from an entrance slit to an output IR recording camera. With an initial wavelength range of 1500 – 4500 nm required, gratings {{could not be used}} in the spectrometer because grating orders would overlap. A magnesium oxide prism, placed between these <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors,</b> serves as the dispersion element. The spectrometer is doubly telecentric. With proper choice of the air spacing between the prism and the second <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror,</b> any spectral region of interest within the InSb camera array’s sensitivity region can be recorded. The wavelengths leaving the second <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> are collimated, thereby relaxing the camera positioning tolerance. To set up the instrument, two different wavelength (visible) lasers are introduced at the entrance slit and made collinear with the optical axis via flip mirrors. After dispersion by the prism, these two laser beams are directed to tick marks located on the outside housing of the gated IR camera. This provides first-order wavelength calibration for the instrument. Light that is reflected off the front prism face is coupled into a high-speed detector to verify steady radiance during the gated spectral imaging. Alignment features include tick marks on the prism and <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors.</b> This instrument was designed to complement singlepoint pyrometry, which provides continuous time histories of a small collection of spots from shock-heated targets...|$|R
40|$|Thermal imaging is an important, though challenging, {{diagnostic}} for shockwave experiments. Shock-compressed materials undergo {{transient temperature}} changes that cannot be recorded with standard (greater than ms response time) infrared detectors. A further complication arises when optical elements near the experiment are destroyed. We have designed a thermal-imaging system for studying shock temperatures produced inside a gas gun at Sandia National Laboratories. Inexpensive, diamond-turned, <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors</b> relay {{an image of}} the shocked target to the exterior of the gas gun chamber through a sapphire vacuum port. The 3000 – 5000 -nm portion of this image is directed to an infrared camera which acquires a snapshot of the target with a minimum exposure time of 150 ns. A special mask is inserted at the last intermediate image plane, to provide dynamic thermal background recording during the event. Other wavelength bands of this image are split into high-speed detectors operating at 900 – 1700 nm, and at 1700 – 3000 nm for timeresolved pyrometry measurements. This system incorporates 90 -degree, off-axis <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors,</b> which can collect low f/# light over a broad spectral range, for high-speed imaging. Matched mirror pairs must be used so that aberrations cancel. To eliminate image plane tilt, proper tip-to-tip orientation of the <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors</b> is required.
