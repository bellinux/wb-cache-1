40|$|At {{the end of}} the 18 th {{century and}} the {{beginning}} of the 19 th century, in the context of penetration of capitalist relations and the territorial losses associated with the annexation of Bessarabia and Bukovina, the Carpathian transhumance phenomenon develops new peculiarities. Namely, the analysis of documentary sources indicates the existence in this period of two types of transhumance. The first type, which we can call conventionally “traditional”, had a seasonal character determined by the annual climate change. The second type, which we can call conventionally “entrepreneurial”, targeted the bringing of <b>cattle</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and subsequent shepherding directly to markets, for sale. While the traditional transhumance practically ceased in Bessarabia after the lands in the southern regions were distributed for colonization, the entrepreneurial transhumance developed throughout the whole period, being carried especially by Armenians and Jews of Habsburg subjection. In this second type of transhumance, the shepherds were substituted by entrepreneurs, who bought lambs, calves and foals from different owners and then drove them “to pasture and wintering” in Bessarabia, where they rented uninhabited lands and hired workers. Then the mature herds were shepherded outside Bessarabia for sale at various fairs of Galicia and Bukovina, and even Moravia. The Russian customs agencies on the Prut recorded the seasonal migration of livestock in figures and names, routes and duration. The tsarist authorities did not completely prohibit this phenomenon, despite the complaints of local entrepreneurs. On the contrary, aiming to increase the accumulations resulting from customs duties and various taxes on livestock, they stimulated it, allowing free entry into the territory of Bessarabia for foreign subjects dealing with cattle trade. ...|$|E

In 1981, about 71 percent of the beef production was accounted for by dairy beef of which more than half was derived from dairy bull <b>cattle</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> In order to increase the beef production, {{it is very important}} tot stabilize the profitability of dairy bull cattle feeding farms. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify the structural characteristics and the factors contributing to profitability of dairy bull cattle feeding management in Fukuoka Prefecture. This study is based on data derived from farm records of the Survey on Production Costs of Dairy Bull <b>Cattle</b> <b>for</b> <b>Fattening</b> in Fukuoka Pref., which was conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan(MAFFJ) in 1980. The results of this study can be summarized as follows: 1. Average herb size of the cattle feeding operations was 47 heads in 1982. About 10 percent of the cattle on feed was fattened by dairy farmers. 2. Almost 75 percent of the cattle and 13 percent from rice. Average fattening period was 11. 8 monthsand daily gain was 1. 0 kg. 3. Feeder cattle, commercial feed, and family labor accounted for 39 percent, 41 percent, and 10 percent of the total production cost per head, respectively. Cattle feeders recorded a high profitability untile 1980, but they suffered from a large loss in 1981. This loss resulted from price fluctuations of feeder cattle and fed cattle. 4. The total production cost per fed cattle decreased only slightly as the herd size increased because most of the itemsused in cattle feeding, except labor and litter, fell into the category of variable costs. But scale economy in labor input contributed largely to increasing labor return per day and labor productivity. 5. It was found that extending the fattening period lowered the daily gain and increased the total production cost per unit of live weight. But fed cattle price per unit of live weight tended to increase with an increase in length of the fattening period. This fact appeared to encourage the cattle feeders to extend the fattening period. But the ratio of fed cattle price to total production cost and the labor return per day didn 2 ̆ 7 t always increase as the fattening period extended. 6. Labor return per day increased with the increasing price of dressed carcasses, but the rate of increase was found to be less in the case of small scale cattle feeders than in the large. Because of this, it seems that the small scale cattle feeders make efforts to increase profitability by extending the fattening period and by using too much commercial feed and labor. But this may cause the instability in profitability. 7. The break-even point of the cattle feeding was found to be located at a high level, 92 percent of the gross income. To increase profits, cattle feeders must lower the position of the break-even point. 日本における牛肉生産の大きな特徴の 1 つは，牛肉生産と酪農が強く結びついていることである． 1981 年現在，乳用種は牛肉生産量の 71 ％，牛肉供給量の 53 ％を占め，その半分以上が乳雄牛肥経営の収益性は必ずしも安定的とはいいがたく，牛肉の安定的供給のためにも乳雄牛肥育経営の安定的生産体制の確立が要請されている．本稿では以上のような認識に基づき，福岡県を中心として乳雄牛肥育経営の構造的特徴と収益性影響要因の解明を試みた．資料は 1980 年の農林水産省「乳用おす肥育牛生産費個表」福岡県分である．分析結果は以下のように要約できる．（ 1 ）福岡県の乳雄牛飼養頭数は 1982 年現在約 25 千頭と九州の 18 ％を占める． 1 戸当たり飼養規模は 47 頭であり，九州及び全国より 2 倍以上大きい．同県における肉用牛に占める乳雄牛の頭数割合は 79 ％と九州（ 17 ％）及び全国（ 36 ％）よりはるかに大きい．酪農家による乳雄牛の哺育育成及び肥育は，戸数で 5 分の 1 ，頭数で 10 分の 1 を占めるが，中でも哺育育成の割合が大きい．（ 2 ）ほとんどの乳雄牛肥育経営は水田との複合経営を営んでいるが，農業総収入に占める割合は肥育牛 75 ％，米 13 ％と肥育専門経営が多い． 1980 年現在福岡県の肥育期間は 11. 8 か月， 1 日当たり増体量は 1. 0 ㎏， 1 頭当たり労働時間は 52. 8 時間である．肥育素牛の供給は県内生産より北海道を中心とする県外導入が多く，これらの流通の大部分を農協が担っている．（ 3 ） 1980 年現在乳雄肥育牛 1 頭当たりの第 2 次生産費は 466 千円であり，そのうち素牛費と流通飼料費がそれぞれ 4 割ずつ，労働費が 1 割を占める．また，所得は 85 千円， 1 日当たり家族労働報酬は 11 千円である．この 1 日当たり家族労働報酬は素牛費の上昇と販売価格の下落に強く影響を受け， 1981 年にはマイナス 6 千円以下と急減する．稲ワラは粗飼料用としても不足し 3 分の 2 を購入に依存している．敷料はほぼ全部がおが屑である．（ 4 ）飼養規模の拡大とともに労働時間と敷料費は大きく低減したが，これらの生産費全体に占める割合が小さいため第 2 次生産費における規模の経済性はそれほど大きく現れなかった．しかし， 1 日当たり家族労働報酬は省力化のため規模拡大とともに大きく逓増した．一方，規模拡大により資本生産性はやや低下するものの，資本装備率が大きく増大し労働生産性が高くなる．規模拡大と資本装備率の高度化は収益性向上のため重要であるが，借入金による過度な資本投資は経営不安定の要因になろう．（ 5 ）肥育期間の延長は 1 日当たり増体量の減少と生産費の逓増をもたらした．しかし，同時に肥育期間の延長とともに単位当たり販売価格の上昇傾向もみられた． 1980 年福岡県の場合価格・生産費比率は肥育期間が長くなるにつれて大きくなり，収益性の逓増をもたらした．このような傾向は小規模経営を中心とする高級肉づくり指向の誘因になっていると思われる．しかし，この傾向は年と地域によってかなり差がある．（ 6 ）枝肉単為の上昇による 1 日当たり家族労働報酬の増加率は小規模経営ほど小さい．そのため，一定の収益性をあげるため小規模経営は大規模経営に比べてより単価の高い牛肉を生産しなければならない．しかし，経営基盤の弱い小規模経営の過度な肥育期間延長，濃厚飼料多給及び労働多投による高級肉づくりは，生産費の逓増や肥育効率の低下をもたらし，要素価格及び枝肉価格の変動や格付成績のいかんによって収益不安定に陥るおそれがある．（ 7 ）福岡県の乳雄牛肥育経営の損益分岐点は 1980 年現在 467 千円であり，粗収益の 92 ％に位置する．これは同年全国の 81 ％よりかなり高い．損益分岐点を低くし利潤をあげるためには一定費の節減を図らねばならない．すなわち，素牛費と労働費の節減が重要である．しかし，近年素牛価格は上昇傾向にあり収益不安定の大きな原因になっている． 1981 年の収益性悪化の最も大きな要因は枝肉価格の急落である．再生産を確保できるような価格安定制度の工夫が強く要請される．肥育素牛の安価かつ安定的供給と，粗飼料利用による肥育の効率性増大も今後の重要な課題であろう...|$|E

In this study, special attention has been focused on, (1) production costs and profitability, (2) factors contributing to profitability, and (3) estimation of production functions for beef production. The data used in this study were farm records of the Survey on Production Costs for Japanese Black <b>Cattle</b> <b>for</b> <b>Fattening</b> (fattening of castrated young cattle) in Kagoshima Pref., which was conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (MAFFJ) in 1980. The results of this study can be summarized as follows: 1. Average herd size for cattle feeding operations was 6. 5 heads in 1982. Over two-thirds of the perators managed only one or two heads, and, less than 7. 7 percent of the operators had herds of 20 or more. 2. In 1980, the average fattening period was 15. 8 months and the daily gain was 0. 65 kg. Feed conversion tended to increase as herd size increased, and average feed conversion was 8. 5. 3. Cattle feeding operators in this area tended to use more feed per unit of live weight than the national average level, including both commercial mixed feed and self-supplied roughage. This feeding system resulted in low profitability in this area. 4. It was found that extending the fattening period did not always increase profitability. Profitability was found to be largely influenced by price fluctuations in feeder cattle and dressed carcasses. 5. High labor returns per day were accounted for by high values of the ratio of fed cattle price to total production cost, and vice versa. In order to increase profitability, cattle feeding operators in this area must decrease production costs by substituting roughage for concentrate. 6. The estimated elasticities for feeder cattle, feed, labor hour, and replacement reserve, estimated using tha Cobb-Douglas production function, were 0. 5959, 0. 2278, 0. 1324, and 0. 0576, respectively. The marginal productiviry of feeder cattle indicated that increaseing feeder cattle investment by one thousand yen increased gross income by 1, 409 yen. This suggests that selecting good feeder cattle is very important for increasing profitability in Japanese Black Cattle feeding management. 本稿では,和牛肥育経営の経済性を明らかにするために,全国最大の和牛産地である鹿児島県を中心として, (1) 生産費の構造と収益性, (2) 収益性影響要因,(3) 生産関数の計測に焦点をあてながら分析してきた. 資料は 1980 年の農林水産省｢肥育牛(黒毛和種の去勢若齢肥育) 生産費個表｣鹿児島県分である. 分析結果は以下のとおりである.

The study involved survey to assess cattle fattening and marketing practices, and action research to evaluate the effect of homemade concentrate from locally available feed resources on fattening performance and economic return of indigenous cattle. The survey part involved interviewing 120 households purposively selected from six kebeles in three agro ecologies. Focus group discussions and key informants have been employed to enrich the data. The feeding trial was conducted in Danible Ottora Kebele,with 18 (9 castrate and 9 non – castrate) indigenous cattle for 70 days excluding adaptation period of 15 days. Treatments included farmer’s practices alone (T 1); T 1 + concentrate supplementation at 1 % of body weight (T 2); and T 1 + concentrate supplementation at 1. 5 % of body weight (T 3). Maize stover and stubble grazing was provided as a basic ration which was the farmers feeding practice. Experimental animals were blocked by farms/households and randomly assigned to three feeding treatments separately. Heart girth and body condition score were recorded while body weight was estimated from heart girth using regression equation developed for zebu cattle. The data were analyzed using the General Linear Model Procedure of statistical package for Social Science (SPSS 16). The result showed that the most dominant cattle breed used for fattening in the study area was indigenous. The major source of <b>cattle</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> was through purchasing from market (69. 1 %) followed by raising at home (24. 2 %). Almost all fatteners in highland (95 %) and mid-altitude (100 %) were engaged in fattening castrate. Concerning physiological stage of the fattening animals, most of the producers (83 %) use matured & old oxen. In highland, majority of the farmers fatten cattle once within a year (60 %), while it was three times per year for mid-altitude (42. 5 %) and two times per year for lowland (70 %) agro-ecologies. The majority (90 %) {{of the respondents indicated that}} the most common criteria used to decide fattening period was body condition of the animals. Majority of the respondents in the highland, mid altitude and lowland fatten cattle for six months, three months and five months, respectively. The major types of feed resources for the fattening animal were natural pasture, crop residues, stubble grazing, grass hay and feed supplements. The major criteria used while purchasing fattening cattle included frame size, heath, body condition, coat color and price of animals. The experience in cattle fattening, large cattle population, diverse & suitable agroecology, availability of crop residues, high irrigation potential, initiation of the introduction of improved forage species and cheap labor force reveals the potential of the area for improved cattle fattening. However, feed shortage, shortage of land, prevalence of disease, poor access for credit service and marketing information, and underdeveloped cattle marketing were the major constraints that hinder the performance of cattle fattening. The feeding trial showed that average daily gain were highest (p< 0. 05) for animals supplemented with T 3 followed by T 2 and T 1. Similarly, the net return was higher (P< 0. 05) for the supplemented group (T 2 & T 3) compared to non-supplemented group kept under farmers management (T 1). Among the supplemented groups, marginal rate of return was higher for animals supplemented with T 2 compared to T 3. Thus, it can be concluded that when resources are not meager smallholders producers could use supplementation at 1. 5 % of body weight for higher return. However, when resources are limited producers are advised to supplement at 1 % of body weight for higher marginal rate of return. Detail research work on availability, nutrient composition and digestibility of the major feed resource are recommended for further work. Global Affairs Canad...|$|E
40|$|Sheep-and-wool {{production}} and beef-cattle production are combined on many grazing {{properties in the}} Western District of Victoria. In the past beef cattle have generally been regarded as less profitable than sheep as a sole enterprise on a per-acre basis. In previous surveys {{it has been found}} that graziers believe that sheep and beef-cattle complement one another in a variety of circumstances because of the different effects of the two types of animal on pasture. It has also been found that sheep and beef cattle on grazing properties are frequently supplementary with respect to labour. The thesis has two main objectives. First it investigates whether the currently available analytical models based on static economic theory are adequate to solve problems of resource allocation between sheep and beef cattle grazing the same pasture. Second, it investigates whether many graziers carry beef cattle partly or solely to satisfy goals other than profit maximisation. The method of achieving the first objective was to compare the static economic theory relating to enterprise combination, and published work dealing with the problem of selecting the optimum combination of two enterprises, with the real situation existing on grazing properties carrying both sheep and beef cattle. The second objective was investigated by means or an interview survey of graziers running both sheep and beef cattle in six Western District parishes. A considerable amount of technical information about beef-cattle production in the Western District was collected {{in the course of the}} survey, and the more important points are summarised in the thesis. Of particular interest are the findings that very few graziers purchased <b>cattle</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> purposes, and that beef cattle were relatively more important on large properties than on small properties. It was concluded that static economic theory does not provide an adequate basis for the description of the situation where sheep and cattle graze the same pasture, or for the determination of the optimum allocation of resources between sheep arid beef cattle grazing together. Sheep and cattle graze pasture differently, and therefore different pastures result as the sheep-cattle ratio is altered. In this situation, the postulates on which the iso-resource function is based, that the shared input or inputs should remain homogeneous and constant in quantity as the outputs of the products change, are violated. Thus strictly speaking it is not possible to derive a valid iso-resource function relating the sheep and beef-cattle enterprises with respect to pasture when the sheep and the cattle graze the same pasture. However, if the changes in the pasture are disregarded, it is possible to design experiments to produce practical approximations of iso-resource curves relating sheep and beef cattle. Information obtained from graziers in this and other surveys, and the results of experiments, strongly suggest that for practical purposes it is reasonable to think of an iso-resource curve for sheep and cattle with respect to pasture as being concave towards the origin, that is, the sacrifice rate of sheep for cattle increases as more cattle are added on a sheep property. Farmer estimates and experimental evidence suggests that the marginal sacrifice rate on most properties may be lower than is generally assumed (nutritional standards imply a linear rate of eight merino whethers per 1, 000 lb. steer). Almost all the survey graziers believed that the overall relationship between their sheep and their beef cattle with respect to their total feed supply over the whole year was a competitive one. Most estimated that their sheep and their cattle were complementary or supplementary with respect to pasture over a part of the year, including the Spring, and that their sheep and their cattle competed for scarce pasture at some time in the autumn and winter. The survey results showed that the most important reason for the presence of beef cattle on the survey properties was the value of cattle in controlling and utilising pasture and weed growth. However the value 0 f cattle for that purpose appeared to decline as the sheep stocking rate increased. It appeared that on many properties the importance of beef cattle in pasture control was a consequence of a desire on the part of the grazier to maximise profits within the restrictions imposed by limitations on sheep numbers including the grazier's desire to limit his personal effort. Beef cattle were also frequently carried for the reason that they provided a means of stabilising income from year to year. Although the survey results tended to confirm previous findings that sheep and beef cattle are supplementary with respect to labour at certain times during the year, and that beef cattle generally require less labour per unit of return than sheep, few graziers said that they carried beef cattle for those reasons. It was concluded that substantial minority of the survey graziers did carry beef cattle partly or solely to satisfy goals other than profit maximisation. The most important of these goals was the minimisation of personal effort, which was shown not by giving labour as a reason for carrying beef cattle, but indirectly in the affirmation of the value of cattle (rather than additional sheep) in pasture control. A few graziers were motivated by a personal preference for beef cattle. In the situation where the available economic theory is inadequate to solve problems of resource allocation between sheep and beef cattle, and where a substantial proportion of graziers carry beef cattle partly or solely for reasons other than profit maximisation, there is little scope for sophisticated economic procedures. Given additional experimental data to provide indicators of probable "substitution rates", it seems that the allocation of resources between sheep and beef cattle on properties such as those in the survey can best be improved by budgeting possible adjustments.

40|$|A {{family farm}} model {{was used in}} order to study the {{economic}} importance of pasture utilization in sheep breeding and cattle fattening during the summer period. The model was based on real technological, organizational and economic conditions of a farm in the hill and mountain regions of eastern Serbia. The economic competitiveness of different ways of pasture utilization was studied based on the processing price of green feed obtained from pastures. Under the given economic conditions, a higher processing price of feed may be expected in cattle fattening. Thus, from the economic standpoint farms involved in cattle fattening would have a justifiable production. However, due to the changing market conditions {{it was necessary to}} determine the processing prices at different price levels of <b>fattened</b> <b>cattle,</b> animals <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and the production value per breeding ewe. A special diagram was constructed enabling a rapid and easy determination of the processing price of feed in practice taking into account different market conditions of sheep breeding and cattle fattening.

Analytical techniques able to detect trace amounts of the parent drugs and their metabolites are mandatory for the control of abuse.

The difference between the structure of Stan and the ether steroids (a pyrazole ring fused to the androstane ring system) is probably the cause of this phenomenon. In the multi-laboratory study described here, veal calves were treated with intramuscular doses of Stan. In the excreta of these calves the presence, absence and/or concentration of Stan and of its major metabolites 16 β-hydroxystanozolol and 3 '-hydroxystanozolol were determined. For the determination of these analytes the different laboratories used different extraction and clean-up procedures and also evaluated different analytical techniques such as GC-MS (negative chemical ionization) and LC-MS-MS.
