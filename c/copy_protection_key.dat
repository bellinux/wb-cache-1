In 2005, it produced CopyMinder (software-based <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> {{that uses the}} Internet where possible to provide an 'intelligent' <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> system). More recently, it has expanded its security products by producing SmartSign, a multi-factor authentication system that supports using mobile devices to control access to web pages.|$|R
50|$|A {{hardware-based}} <b>protection</b> <b>key,</b> or dongle, is {{best suited}} to software publishers concerned about the security of their product as it offers {{the highest level of}} <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> and IP <b>protection.</b> Although a <b>key</b> must be physically connected in order to access or run an application, end users are not required to install any device drivers on their machines. A software-based <b>protection</b> <b>key</b> is ideal for software publishers who require flexible license delivery. The virtual nature of software keys eliminates the need to ship a physical product, thus enabling end users to quickly install and use an application with minimal fuss. Cloud-based licensing, on the other hand, provides automatic and immediate license enablement, so users can access software from any device including virtual machines and mobile devices.|$|R

Because the graduate student had frequent <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> discussions with Apple’s <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> engineer, Apple developed a <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> system which made use of this technique.Henry Roberts then wrote a competitive program to Locksmith, Back It UP.

Hence, while carefully developing our motivations, some light is shed on the very peculiar problems raised by the enforcement of <b>copy</b> <b>protection.</b> It gives then an overview of the global SmartRight system and some technical details on its main innovative features. I. Introduction: Context and birth of the SmartRight <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> system This section presents the context of <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> dealing with legal and socio-economic aspects.

5000|$|In 2005, Sony BMG Music Entertainment was criticised when a <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> {{mechanism}} {{known as}} Extended <b>Copy</b> <b>Protection</b> (XCP) used {{on some of}} their audio CDs automatically and surreptitiously installed copy-prevention software on computers (see 2005 Sony BMG CD <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> scandal). Such discs are not legally allowed to be called CDs or Compact Discs because they break the Red Book standard governing CDs, and Amazon.com for example describes them as [...] "copy protected discs" [...] rather than [...] "compact discs" [...] or [...] "CDs".|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze how {{digitalization}} affects pricing and private <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> in contents industries. Digitalization enables content providers and online retailers to implement <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> at different stages of creation and distribution of contents. We construct a model of vertical relationship where an upstream [a downstream] firm is considered as a content provider [a retailer]. Three different business models are proposed according to the ownership structure of <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> determined the right to implement by a vertically-integrated entity, an upstream firm, and a downstream firm. In this setup we show that the results are dependent upon the degree of opportunistic behavior responding to increasing rival (piracy) costs under the different <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> ownership. In addition, to address the change in demand side with digitalization we consider two different types of piracy differentiated by distribution channels (e. g., non-digital versus digital). We show that the effect of piracy on price and private <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> depend critically on the nature of distribution channels and the dimension of differentiation between originals and pirated contents. In particular, strengthening IPR protection results in a price hike for the both cases, while we have opposite changes in quantities and the level of <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> depending on different types of piracy...|$|R
