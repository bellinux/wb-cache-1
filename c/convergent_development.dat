50|$|There may be {{different}} answers given {{to the question of}} which elements of Itelmen are original and which have been brought about by contact with other languages. To take the second hypothesis, Itelmen was at the very beginning an agglutinative language, with word structure (m) + R + (m) (where R is a root and (m) one of several word-changing morphemes), it was nominal, compounds were prohibited; it preserves all of these elements into the present. A difference in reported material origin with Chukotko-Koryak languages in declensional and conjugational paradigms is the result of <b>convergent</b> <b>development</b> under conditions of a Chukotko-Kamchatkan Sprachbund. Incorporation goes against word structure (not more than one root morpheme), thus Itelmen did not take it on. Reduplication of a root, inherent to all the languages of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan group, was able to develop in Itelmen apart from the influence of contact.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare the {{regional}} network relationships {{of small and}} medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the mechanical engineering and related metal manufacturing industries in Japan and Germany. We show that the structure of network relationships is still largely determined by traditional forms of the organization of production, despite <b>convergent</b> <b>developments.</b> The network relationships of SMEs in Japan are thus very largely determined by a hierarchically organized system of production. By contrast, the German SMEs almost always have far more scope for strategic action than their Japanese counterparts because they are less dependent on large companies and have their own distinctive images in the final markets. In both countries, cooperative network relationships are on the increase. However, reregionalization as postulated in the flexible specialization hypothesis {{does not appear to be}} a dominant trend in either Japan or Germany. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{provides}} {{a comparison of}} two varieties of the Votic language. Based on fi eld materials collected between 2001 and 2012 from the last speakers of Votic, we {{compiled a list of}} the most important phonetic and grammatical features that distinguish between Jõgõperä and Luuditsa varieties. The ten features are: the degree of apocope, the initial h, merging of allative and adessive cases, secondary geminates, illative singular forms, genitive and partitive plural markers, imperfect forms, the active participle marker, conditional markers, and negative pronominal forms. The analysis has shown that many differences {{can be explained by the}} infl uence of the neighbour-ing Ingrian language. There are more contact induced changes in the Luuditsa variety, which is probably the result of more intensive contacts with the Ingrian population in this village.

The article brings into focus the genetic and functional status of American English and states its main distinctive features as a language variant of the English language. The article adopts a historical approach to the development of morphological divergences of North American English usage. The article provides historical evidence supported by illustrations taken from Shakespeare’s works to a peculiar character of the North American usage of adverbs without the adverbial suffix -ly and their counterparts with the adverbial suffix. The article also touches upon the problem of American English and British English interrelationship in the contemporary sociolinguistic contexts, on the process of divergent and <b>convergent</b> <b>developments</b> of the transplanted variety and its mainland source. The article points out three possible forms of North American influences on British English: introduction of new forms, reintroduction of old forms and a supporting effect on the process underway. The article states that the North American English distinctive features seen in the usage of adverbs without the adverbial suffix -ly in literary oral and written types of discourse are not innovations but factually optional realizations revealed in usage. They show regional language variation determined by common linguistic and different sociolinguistic factors of the evolution of the same language system...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of {{the compound}} eyes of 13 amphipod species has been investigated. An amphipod type of compound eye can be characterized by the constellation and consistency {{of a number of}} morphological features, most of which are also found in other compound eyes. The amphipod eye falls into four sub-categories (types). The ampeliscid type has a tripartite aberrant lens eye; the lysianassid type has a reduced or no dioptric apparatus and a hypertrophied rhabdom; the hyperid type possesses a large number of ommatidial units with long crystalline cones and dark instead of reflecting accessory pigment; and finally, the gammarid type can be interpreted as a generalized amphipod type. The lysianassid type is adapted to low light intensities and demonstrates <b>convergent</b> <b>development</b> with the compound eyes of other deep-sea crustaceans.

40|$|The {{constraints}} {{of an active}} life in a pelagic habitat led to numerous convergent morphological and physiological adaptations that enable cephalopod molluscs and teleost fishes to compete for similar resources. Here, we show {{for the first time}} that such <b>convergent</b> <b>developments</b> are also found in the ontogenetic progression of ion regulatory tissues; as in teleost fish, epidermal ionocytes scattered on skin and yolk sac of cephalopod embryos appear to be responsible for ionic and acid-base regulation before gill epithelia become functional. Ion and acid-base regulation is crucial in cephalopod embryos, as they are surrounded by a hypercapnic egg fluid with a Pco 2 between 0. 2 and 0. 4 kPa. Epidermal ionocytes were characterized via immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and vital dye-staining techniques. We found one group of cells that is recognized by concavalin A and MitoTracker, which also expresses Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE 3) and Na+-K+-ATPase. Similar to findings obtained in teleosts, these NHE 3 -rich cells take up sodium in exchange for protons, illustrating the energetic superiority of NHE-based proton excretion in marine systems. In vivo electrophysiological techniques demonstrated that acid equivalents are secreted by the yolk and skin integument. Intriguingly, epidermal ionocytes of cephalopod embryos are ciliated as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy, suggesting a dual function of epithelial cells in water convection and ion regulation. These findings add significant knowledge to our mechanistic understanding of hypercapnia tolerance in marine organisms, as it demonstrates that marine taxa, which were identified as powerful acid-base regulators during hypercapnic challenges, already exhibit strong acid-base regulatory abilities during embryogenesis...|$|R

It is argued that in several genera and sections, as previously recognized, too much stress {{was placed on the}} several floral characters which form part of a pollination syndrome which is shown up by <b>convergent</b> <b>developments</b> of these flower types. The different types of seedling morphology recognized are considered in relation to the morphology of adult plants and their affinities at specific and sectional level.

A cytological review stresses the different basic chromosome numbers (8, 7) and their structural differences for the delimitation of the subgenera. Problems in determining the original basic number and the high percentage of polyploidy with various rainfall conditions are evaluated. Subsequently the characteristics and affinities of Crassula and its subgeneric taxa are briefly discussed. The key to the species, subspecies and varieties is divided into twelve groups which are similar to sections or groups of sections recognized.

40|$|The paper {{begins with}} an {{analysis}} of the growth of surface transport systems. We analyze ex post the <b>convergent</b> <b>development</b> of rail and road transport reaching divergent densities in different countries. This then serves as an illustrative case to investigate further the diffusion of the automobile, and to derive a global scenario for future automobile fleets. Based on our conclusions with respect to the future evolution of transport system structure and scenario of forthcoming global saturation in automobile diffusion, we then discuss the long-term development possibilities for more productive surface transport systems such as maglev trains. Ultimately, further increases in mobility would require the introduction of new and more productive and environmentally clean transport modes. This hypothesis will be used to determine what the possible effects would be if barriers to mobility are removed. Alternatives include examples of both the development of new physical infrastructures (e. g., a high-speed rail network) and the reduction of institutional and political obstacles (e. g., the former iron curtain). Imposition on new institutional and political barriers would have the opposite effect of reducing mobility and decoupling previous functional unities into separate entities...|$|E

There {{has been some}} retrenchment in eldercare evident in falling coverage and stronger targeting of people {{with higher levels of}} need. This development has led to the informalization of care for some groups of older people. In disability care, there has been a considerable expansion of services, perhaps most notably in the introduction of a personal assistance scheme for people with severe disabilities. These divergent trends in services for older people and people with disabilities have coincided with a <b>convergent</b> <b>development</b> across both care fields: the marketization of services and the emergence of large, corporate, for-profit providers.

Prickles and spines were characterised by their size, orientation and the maximum force measured at failure in mechanical tests performed with traction forces applied at different angles. In Rosa arvensis and Rosa arvensis 'Splendens' three types of prickles differing largely in geometrical and mechanical properties are identified (prickles of the wild species and two types of prickles in the cultivar). In prickles of Rosa arvensis no particular orientation of the prickle tip is found whereas in the cultivar Rosa arvensis 'Splendens' prickles gradually gain a downward-orientation due to differential growth in the first weeks of their development. Differences in mechanical properties and modes of failure are correlated to geometrical parameters. In Asparagus falcatus and Asparagus setaceus spines are composed of leaf tissue, stem tissue and tissue of the axillary bud. Between species spines differ in size, orientation, distribution along the stem, tissue contributions and mechanical properties. The prickles of Rosa arvensis and its cultivar and the spines of the studied Asparagus species have several traits in common: (1) a gradual change of cell size and cell wall thickness, with larger cells in the centre and smaller thick-walled cells at {{the periphery of the}} hooks, (2) occurrence of a diversity of shape and geometry within one individual, (3) failure of single hooks when submitted to moderate mechanical stresses (Fmax/basal area < 35 N/mm²) and (4) failure of the hooks without severe stem damage (at least in the tested wild species) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{collected}} essays comprised in {{this work}} {{are the result of}} the first years of research by the scientists who make up the DynCoopNet work team. In the framework of the EUROCORES Programme as part of the TECT call – The Evolution of Cooperation and Trading – of the European Science Foundation, this was one of five projects approved by this ambitious, interdisciplinary scientific programme. The aim of this programme has been the study of the emergence of and evolutionary processes of exchange and cooperation that occur in nature, including human societies. This programme was based on a series of common ideas. The phenomenon of cooperation essentially has, at various organisational levels, the same roots and raison d’être in all evolutionary processes whether genetic or historic-cultural. Scientists know that these processes emerge in various social contexts or ecosystems, where bacteria or human societies in multinational alliances have been elements involved. However, in most cases, Science is still unable to determine and define cooperation and why it takes place. Despite a relative lack of research, the study of cooperation has had numerous, <b>convergent</b> <b>developments</b> in various fields, such as Economics, Biology and Sociology. It can be said, in practice, that there is a common theory which explains biological and cultural evolution. This theory highlights features of interactions between agents or entities, which have developed even more in relation to economic behaviour than Social and Human Sciences. In this case, our project has been greatly enriched by an excellent bibliographical base. Generally speaking, theories relating to the emergence of cooperation mechanisms have been applied in various fields, from Neuroscience (especially with regards to Cognitive Theory) to Economic History (Game Theory). Within this broad research framework, “Dynamic Cooperation Networks” is an interdisciplinary project with historians, mathematicians, cartographers and GIS engineers from the USA, Portugal, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, India, Sweden, Mozambique and other countries.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} basic {{revision}} of the understanding of teleology in biological sciences. Since Kant, it has become customary to view purposiveness in organisms as a bias added by the observer; the recent notion of teleonomy expresses well this “as-if ” character of natural purposes. In recent developments in science, however, notions such as selforganization (or complex systems) and the autopoiesis viewpoint, have displaced emergence and circular self-production as central features of life. Contrary to an often superficial reading, Kant gives a multi-faceted account of the living, and anticipates this modern reading of the organism, even introducing the term “self-organization ” for the first time. Our re-reading of Kant in this light is strengthened {{by a group of}} philosophers of biology, with Hans Jonas as the central figure, who put back on center stage an organism-centered view of the living, an autonomous center of concern capable of providing an interior perspective. Thus, what is present in nuce in Kant, finds a <b>convergent</b> <b>development</b> from this current of philosophy of biology and the scientific ideas around autopoeisis, two independent but parallel developments culminating in the 1970 s. Instead of viewing meaning or value as artifacts or illusions, both agree on a new understanding of a form of immanent teleology as truly biological features, inevitably intertwined with the self-establishment of an identity which is the living process. A clash of doctrines is not a disaster, it is an opportunity. A. N. Whitehead 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{descriptions}} of fossil Triassic marine pla- codonts as durophagous reptiles are revised through comparisons with the sirenia and basal proboscidean mammal and palaeoenvironment analyses. The jaws of placodonts are conver- gent {{with those of}} Halitherium/Dugong or Mo- eritherium in their general function. Whereas Halitherium possessed a horny oral pad and counterpart and a special rasp-like tongue to grind seagrass, as does the modern Dugong, placodonts had large teeth that covered their jaws to form a similar grinding pad. The sirenia also lost their anterior teeth during many Millions of years and built a horny pad instead and specialized tongue to fed mainly on seagrass, whereas placodonts had only macroalgae availa- ble. Indirect evidence for Triassic macroalgae is provided by benthic palaeocommunities from different layers and extended European regions in the Germanic Basin. Studies of tooth wear stages for Placodus indicate that anterior teeth {{may have been used}} in a similar manner to the procumbent front teeth of modern Dugong. Paraplacodus and Placodus seem to have used these teeth as spatulas to dig out seaplants. Cyamodus and other placodonts such as Placochelys had smaller or reduced anterior teeth. The scarcity of highly worn palatine or maxillary and lower jaw dentary Placodus or Cyamodus teeth (less then 0. 5 %) suggests that they had a relatively soft diet. The seaplants would only have been squeezed in a similar feeding strategy to that of modern Dugong feeding on seagrass without jaw rotation and grinding. The phylogenetic trend in tooth reduction within the placodonts Paraplacodus, Placodus, especially in Cyamodus but also Placochelys, and Henodus within 11 My {{appears to have been a}} result of this plant-feeding adaptation and may even explain the origin or at least close relationship of the earliest Upper Triassic turtles as toothless algae and jellyfish feeders, in terms of the long-term <b>convergent</b> <b>development</b> with the sirens...|$|E
40|$|The {{striking}} {{similarities between}} Old English (OE) and its neighbour Old Frisian (OFris) —including aspects of phonology, morphology, and alliterative phrases—have long been cause for comment, and often for controversy. The {{question of whether}} the resemblance was caused by an immediate common ancestor (Anglo-Frisian) or by neighboring positions in a dialect continuum/Sprachkreis has been hotly disputed using phonological and toponymic evidence, but not in recent years. Consensus in the nineties fell in favour of the dialect continuum, and there the issue has largely rested. However, recent finds in archaeology, history, and genetics argue that the case requires a second look. Developments in grammaticalization theory and contact linguistics give us new tools with which to investigate. Are the similarities between OE and OFris due to an exclusive shared ancestor, or are those languages merely part of a dialect continuum, with no closer relationship than that shared with the other early West Germanic dialects? And are there any reliable criteria to separate out inheritance-based similarities from those that are spread by contact? Shared developments seem, primo facie, to be evidence of shared inheritance, but there are other possible explanations. Parallel drift after separation, <b>convergent</b> <b>development,</b> or coincidence might be the cause of any shared feature. In this paper, I discuss recently proposed methods of distinguishing inheritance from drift and contact, focusing on how morphosyntax can help explore the shared history of OE and OFris. While grammaticalization processes often lead to cross-linguistic similarities, the fact that OE and OFris display a cluster of grammaticalizations not found in other early West Germanic dialects may be significant. The exclusive developments under investigation include aga(n) ‘have’ > ‘have to’ and the present participle as verbal complement. By comparing the forms, meanings, and distribution of these grammaticalized forms in the OFris corpus to that of their cognate forms in OE, I show that the two languages probably diverged from one another substantially later than they diverged from Old Saxon and Old Low Franconian...|$|E
40|$|As roads become busier and {{automotive}} technology improves, {{there is}} considerable potential for driver assistance systems to improve the safety of road users. Longitudinal collision warning and collision avoidance systems are starting to appear on production cars to assist drivers when required to stop in an emergency. Many luxury cars are also equipped with stability augmentation systems that prevent the car from {{spinning out of control}} during aggressive lateral manoeuvres. Combining these concepts, there is a natural progression to systems that could assist in aiding or performing lateral collision avoidance manoeuvres. A successful automatic lateral collision avoidance system would require <b>convergent</b> <b>development</b> of many fields of technology, from sensors and instrumentation to aid environmental awareness through to improvements in driver vehicle interfaces so that a degree of control can be smoothly and safely transferred between the driver and vehicle computer. A fundamental requirement of any collision avoidance system is determination of a feasible path that avoids obstacles and a means of causing the vehicle to follow that trajectory. This research focuses on feasible trajectory generation and development of an automatic obstacle avoidance controller that integrates steering and braking action. A controller is developed to cause a specially modified car (a Mercedes `S' class with steer-by-wire and brake-by-wire capability) to perform an ISO 3888 - 2 emergency obstacle avoidance manoeuvre. A nonlinear two-track vehicle model is developed and used to derive optimal controller parameters using a series of simulations. Feedforward and feedback control is used to track a feasible reference trajectory. The feedforward control loops use inverse models of the vehicle dynamics. The feedback control loops are implemented as linear proportional controllers with a force allocation matrix used to apportion braking effort between redundant actuators. Two trajectory generation routines are developed: a geometric method, for steering a vehicle at its physical limits; and an optimal method, which integrates steering and braking action to make full use of available traction. The optimal trajectory is obtained using a multi-stage convex optimisation procedure. The overall controller performance is validated by simulation using a complex proprietary model of the vehicle that is reported to have been validated and calibrated against experimental data over several years of use in an industrial environment...|$|E
40|$|Caudalization, {{which is}} {{proposed}} {{to be one}} of two functions of the amphibian organizer, initiates posterior pathways of neural development in the dorsalized ectoderm. In the absence of caudalization, dorsalized ectoderm only expresses the most anterior (archen-cephalic) differentiation. In the presence of caudaliza-tion, dorsalized ectoderm develops various levels of posterior neural tissues, depending on the extent of cau-dalization. A series of induction experiments have shown that caudalization is mediated by convergent extension: cell motility that is based on directed cell intercalation, and is essential for the morphogenesis of posterior axial tissues. During amphibian <b>development,</b> <b>convergent</b> extension is first expressed all-over the mesoderm and, after mesoder...|$|R

In the event, rather than the 'two extremes of social union versus a completely deregulated free-for-all', a multi-level system is emerging which is simultaneously prompting both <b>convergent</b> and divergent <b>developments,</b> reflecting the different intensity of pressures for change at sector and company levels.

The idea defended here is that the different C 4 D paradigms (Persuasive vs Participatory) are not contradictory but rather complementary. We present a two-dimensional grid that integrates the Social Marketing along with other persuasive and participatory communicative approaches for Development and Social Change, depending on their : "Communication Mode" and "Object of Change".
