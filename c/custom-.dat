6000|$|Since my {{departure}} from the coast, French naval officers, travellers and traders, have not been idle. The Marquis de Compiègne, who returned to France in 1874, suffering from ulcerated legs, had travelled up the Fernão Vaz, and its tributary the highly irregular Ogobai, Ogowaï, or Ogowé (Ogobe); yet, curious to remark, all his discoveries arc omitted by Herr Kiepert. His furthest point was 213 kilometres east of [...] "San Quita" [...] (Sankwita), a village sixty-one kilometres north (??) of Pointe Fétiche, near Cape Lopez; but wars and receding waters prevented his reaching the confluence where the Ivindo fork enters the north bank of the Ogobe. He made observations amongst the [...] "Kamma" [...] tribe, which differs from the Bakele and other neighbours. M. Guirold, commanding a cruiser, was also sent to the estuary of the Rembo or Fernão Vaz, into which the Mpungule (N'poulounay of M. du Chaillu?), ascended only by M. Aymès, discharges. The explorers found many shoals and shifting sands before entering the estuary; in the evening they stopped at the Ogobe confluence, where a French seaman was employed in <b>custom-</b> house duties. M. de Compiègne, after attending many palavers, was duly upset when returning to the ship.|$|E
6000|$|In those {{walks of}} ours I {{believe he did}} most of the talking, and from his talk then and at other times there remains to me an {{impression}} of his growing conservatism. I had in fact come into his life when it had spent its impulse towards positive reform, and I was to be witness of its increasing tendency towards the negative sort. He was quite past the storm and stress of his anti-slavery age; with the close of the war which had broken for him all his ideals of inviolable peace, he had reached the age of misgiving. I do not mean that I ever heard him express doubt of what he had helped to do, or regret for what he had done; but I know that he viewed with critical anxiety what other men were doing with the accomplished facts. His anxiety gave a cast of what one may call reluctance from the political situation, and turned him back towards those civic and social defences which he had once seemed willing to abandon. I do not mean that he lost faith in democracy; this faith he constantly then and signally afterwards affirmed; but he certainly had no longer any faith in insubordination as a means of grace. He preached a quite Socratic reverence for law, as law, and I remember that once when I had got back from Canada in the usual disgust for the American <b>custom-</b> house, and spoke lightly of smuggling as not an evil in itself, and perhaps even a right under our vexatious tariff, he would not have it, but held that the illegality of the act made it a moral of fence. This was not the logic that would have justified the attitude of the anti- slavery men towards the fugitive slave act; but it was in accord with Lowell's feeling about John Brown, whom he honored while always condemning his violation of law; and it was in the line of all his later thinking. In this, he wished you to agree with him, or at least he wished to make you; but he did not wish you to be more of his mind than he was himself. In one of those squalid Irish neighborhoods I confessed a grudge (a mean and cruel grudge, I now think it) for the increasing presence of that race among us, but this did not please him; and I am sure that whatever misgiving he had as to the future of America, he would not have had it less than it had been the refuge and opportunity of the poor of any race or color. Yet he would not have had it this alone. There was a line in his poem on Agassiz which he left out of the printed version, at the fervent entreaty of his friends, as saying too bitterly his disappointment with his country. Writing at the distance of Europe, and with America in the perspective which the alien environment clouded, he spoke of her as [...] "The Land of Broken Promise." [...] It was a splendid reproach, but perhaps too dramatic to bear the full test of analysis, and yet it had the truth in it, and might, I think, have usefully stood, to the end of making people think. Undoubtedly it expressed his sense of the case, and in the same measure it would now express that of many who love their country most among us. It is well to hold one's country to her promises, and if there are any who think she is forgetting them it is their duty to say so, {{even to the point of}} bitter accusation. I do not suppose it was the [...] "common man" [...] of Lincoln's dream that Lowell thought America was unfaithful to, though as I have suggested he could be tender of the common man's hopes in her; but he was impeaching in that blotted line her sincerity with the uncommon man: the man who had expected of her a constancy to the ideals of her youth end to the high martyr-moods of the war which had given an unguarded and bewildering freedom to a race of slaves. He was thinking of the shame of our municipal corruptions, the debased quality of our national statesmanship, the decadence of our whole civic tone, rather than of the increasing disabilities of the hard- working poor, though his heart when he thought of them was with them, too, as it was in [...] "the time when the slave would not let him sleep." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} {{technique}} for robust human–robot interaction {{taking into consideration}} uncertainty in input and task execution costs incurred by the robot. Specifically, this research aims to quantitatively model confirmation feedback, as required by a robot while communicating with a human operator to perform a particular task. Our goal is to model human–robot interaction {{from the perspective of}} risk mini-mization, taking into account errors in communication, “risk” involved in performing the required task, and task execution costs. Given an input modality with non–trivial uncertainty, we calculate the cost associated with performing the task specified by the user, and if deemed necessary, ask the user for confirmation. The estimated task cost and the uncertainty measure are given as input to a Decision Function, the output of which is then used to decide whether to execute the task, or request clarification from the user. We test our system through human–interface experiments, based on a framework <b>custom–</b> designed for our family of amphibious robots, and demonstrate the utility of the framework in the presence of large task costs and uncertainties.

40|$|Foot orthoses {{have long}} been {{prescribed}} by health care professionals for the prevention and treatment of lower limb musculoskeletal overuse conditions. A systematic {{review of the literature}} and meta-analysis of pooled data, where appropriate, was conducted to establish the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of foot orthoses in the management of overuse conditions. A highly sensitive search strategy identified 23 studies (from 22 publications) that met the criteria for inclusion. Ratings of methodological quality on a Modified PEDro Scale ranged from two to 11 out of 14 (mean = 5. 8), which were not significantly correlated with effect size. Evidence from the meta-analysis supports the use of foot orthoses in asymptomatic individuals to prevent lower limb overuse conditions. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of foot orthoses in the treatment of patients with symptoms. Pooled evidence shows that there is no difference in outcome between <b>custom-</b> or pre-fabricated foot orthoses. The pooled evidence paralleled data from individual studies for which data pooling was not possible. In order to progress the evidence base for foot orthoses, future research should focus on issues such as consistent use of outcome measures across studies, longer time frame of the trials, specific definitions of the orthoses and the use of adequate control comparators.

As a novel approach, we simultaneously examined the influence of a <b>custom-</b> made elastic thigh bandage on cutaneous and subcutaneous venous blood oxygenation (SO 2), postcapillary venous filling pressures (rHb) and blood flow (flow) using the non-invasive laser- Doppler spectrophotometry system "Oxygen-to-see(O 2 C) ". Parameters were obtained in 20 healthy volunteers in 2 mm and 8 mm tissue depth during rest, 5 and 10 minutes of moderate bicycle exercise following a 10 -minute recovery period. Without the bandage, results matched the known physiological changes indicating higher blood backflow from superficial and deep veins. Underneath the elastic bandage, we observed lower post-capillary filling pressures during exercise. However, after the bandage was removed in the post-exercise period, all obtained parameters of microcirculation remained increased, indicating a higher amount of local venous blood volume in this area. Our observations might be the result of external compression, thermoregulatory and exercise-dependent vascular mechanisms. With the O 2 C device, a promising new non- invasive technique of measuring local microcirculation in soft tissue exists.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{framework}} for allowing spinal cord injured patients {{to control a}} powered wheelchair through signals derived from the patients’ residual mobility. The main novelty of this approach lies in substituting the typical joystick controllers of powered wheelchairs with a sensor shirt. This allows the whole upper body of the patient to operate as an adaptive joystick. Learning how to navigagte the wheelchair using movements of the upper body requires the disabled person to remap his control-space representation. Our goal is to facilitate this remapping by using the degrees of freedom that patients are most capable to coordinate. This leads to a design that is both <b>custom-</b> oriented and time-varying. With the exception perhaps of the most severe cases- mobility lost to spinal injury can be partially recoverd by remapping the redundant degrees of freedom that remain available to the patients. Considerations about risks, particularly for the spinal cord injured popula- tion, have lead us to develop a safe testing environment in 3 D Virtual Reality. Personal Augmented Reality Immersive System (PARIS) allows us to analyse learning skills and give patients an adequate training to control a simulated wheelchair through the signals generated by body motions in a safe environment.

As each screen is unique, we provide guidelines for determining screening parameters and maintaining sufficient coverage. To validate candidate genes identified by the screen, we further describe strategies for confirming the screening phenotype, as well as genetic perturbation, through analysis of indel rate and transcriptional activation. Beginning with library design, a genome-scale screen can be completed in 9 - 15 weeks, followed by 4 - 5 weeks of validation. Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans (New York, N. Y.)

40|$|Background. The {{number of}} {{patients}} undergoing hip arthroplasty revision is constantly growing. Especially, complex problem is extensive loss of bone stock and pelvic discontinuity that requires reconstruction. Case report. The paper presented a 50 -year old patient, who ten years ago underwent a total cement artrhroplasty of the left hip. A year after the primary operation the patient had difficulties in walking without crutches. Problems intensified {{in the last five}} years, the patient had severe pain, totally limited movement in the left hip and could not walk at all. Radiographically, we found loose femoral component, massive loss of bone stock of proximal femur, acetabular protrusion and a consequent pelvic discontinuity. Clinically, a completely disfunctional left hip joint was registered (Harris hip score - 7. 1). We performed total rearthroplasty by a <b>custom-</b> made Waldemar Link total hip prosthesis with acetabular antiprotrusio cage and compensation of bone defects with a graft from the bone bank. A year after the operation, we found clinically an extreme improvement in Harris hip score - 87. 8. Radiographically, we found stability of implanted components, a complete graft integration and bone bridging across the site of pelvic discontinuity. Conclusion. Pelvic discontinuity and massive loss of proximal femoral bone stock is a challenging and complex entity. Conventional prostheses cannot provide an adequate fixation and stability of the hip. Application of custom-made prosthesis (measured specifically for a patient) and additional alografting bone defects is a good method in revision surgery after unsuccessful hip arthroplasty with extensive bone defects...|$|E

Data on priorities for usability and footwear use (in h/day) were obtained from patient reports. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess determinants of usability and use. Median (interquartile range) score for overall appreciation was 8. 3 (7. 1 - 9. 1). Scores ranged from 6. 5 (4. 5 - 8. 6) for weight to 9. 6 (6. 3 - 9. 9) for donning/doffing. Footwear comfort was listed most often (33. 3 %) as the highest priority. Footwear use was < 60 % of daytime (where daytime was defined as 16 h out of bed) in 58 % of patients. The only significant determinant of footwear use was the perceived benefit of the footwear (p[*]=[*] 0. 045). Perceived usability of footwear was mostly positive, although individual scores and priorities varied considerably. Footwear use was low to moderate and dependent only on the perceived benefit of the footwear. Therefore, practitioners should focus on enhancing the patient's ap-preciation of the therapeutic benefit of custom-made footwea...|$|E
