This study was to evaluate the techniques and outcomes of transanal <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> placement following urgent colonoscopy in management of acute left-sided colorectal obstruction. Methods: From January 2000 to December 2009, 69 consecutive patients (36 males, age 38 to 94, mean = 71) were hospitalized be-cause of acute left-sided colorectal obstruction. Urgent colonosco-py was performed within 12 hours of entry for diagnosis and treat-ment (mean time, 6. 5 hours). Endoscopic decompression using a transanal <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> was attempted. Clinical success, methods used, and complications were retrospectively evaluated. Results: The cause of obstruction was colorectal carcinoma in 66 patients (96 %). The site of obstruction was sigmoid colon in 37 (54 %), rectum in 20 (29 %), and descending colon in 12 (17 %). Out of 69 patients, endoscopic decompression using the transanal <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> was successful in 66 (96 %).

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the stability in {{position of the}} Baerveldt glaucoma <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> over time and to study movement of the <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> in the anterior chamber (AC) under varying light conditions. Methods: This prospective study included 70 eyes with implantation of a Baerveldt glaucoma <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> in the anterior chamber. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images were made preoperatively to quantify AC depth. AS-OCT images were made twice under photopic and twice under scotopic conditions, in the angle parallel to the Baerveldt <b>tube</b> to quantify <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> position, at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Tube-corneal (T-C) and tube-iris (T-I) distances were measured. Additionally, the central AC depth and the peripheral angle opening (AOD 500) were determined. Two subgroups were distinguished according to tube position: free in the AC (group 1, n = 48) and transiridal (group 2, n = 22). Results: After 24 months of follow-up, the <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> was found to move statistically significantly closer (0. 12 mm) to the corneal endothelium in group 1 (p < 0. 01). There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in T-C distance over time in group 2. The T-C distance did not differ under photopic versus scotopic circumstances (p = 0. 32). In both groups, the T-I distance was larger under scotopic conditions, a result of pupil dilation. Conclusions: The Baerveldt glaucoma <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> remained in a stable position when a transiridal implantation was performed, whereas the tube moved closer to the endothelium when placed free into the AC.

40|$|Background and aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the clinical usefulness of the placement of a transanal <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> to prevent anastomotic leakage in colorectal anastomoses. Material and methods: This single-center retrospective trial included all patients treated with surgery for benign or malign colorectal disease between January 2009 and December 2012. The transanal <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> was immediately placed after colorectal anastomosis until day five and was routinely used since 2010. Patients treated with a transanal <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> were compared with the control group. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact or Chi-square tests for group comparison and a linear regression model for multivariate analysis. Results: This study included 242 patients (46 % female; median age 63 years; range 18 – 93); 34 % of the patients underwent a laparoscopic procedure, and 57 % of the patients received a placement of a transanal <b>drainage</b> <b>tube.</b> Anastomotic leakage occurred in 19 patients (7. 9 %). Univariate analysis showed a higher rate of anastomotic leakage in patients with an ASA score 4 (p =  0. 02) and a lower rate in patients with transanal drainage placement (3. 6 % vs. 13. 6 %; p =  0. 007). The grading of the complication of anastomotic leakage was reduced with transanal drainage (e. g., Dindo ≧  3 b: 20. 0 % vs. 92. 9 %; p =  0. 006), and the hospital stay was shortened (17. 6  ±  12. 5 vs. 22. 1  ±  17. 6 days; p =  0. 02).

40|$|Pressure {{transduction}} to {{the wound}} bed in negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) {{is crucial in}} stimulating the biological effects ultimately resulting in wound healing. In clinical practice, either foam or gauze is used as wound filler. Furthermore, two different drainage techniques are frequently employed. One involves the connection of a non-perforated <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> {{to the top of}} the dressing, while the other involves the insertion of perforated drains into the dressing. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of these two different wound fillers and drainage systems on pressure transduction to the wound bed in a challenging wound (the sternotomy wound). Six pigs underwent median sternotomy. The wound was sealed for NPWT using different wound fillers (foam or gauze) and drainage techniques (see earlier). Pressures between 0 and - 175 mmHg were applied and the pressure in the wound was measured using saline-filled catheters sutured to the bottom of the wound (over the anterior surface of the heart) and to the side of the wound (on the thoracic wall). The negative pressure on the wound bed increased linearly with the negative pressure delivered by the vacuum source. In a dry wound, the pressure transduction was similar when using the different wound fillers (foam and gauze) and drainage techniques. In a wet wound, pressure transduction was better when using a perforated <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> inserted into the wound filler than a non-perforated <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> connected {{to the top of the}} dressing (- 116 +/- 1 versus - 73 +/- 4 mmHg in the wound at a delivered pressure of - 125 mmHg for foam, P < 0. 01), regardless of the type of wound filler.

We {{evaluated}} {{the suitability of}} indicator dye placement in the upper digestive tract of anesthetized patients combined with fiberoptical tracing to investigate the fluid seal of SGA. Methods: Patients swallowed a capsule of indigo carmine green (ICG) prior to induction of anaesthesia. After induction of anesthesia, one of two different SGA (either an i-Gel™ or an LMA-Supreme ™ (LMA-S)) was inserted after randomization. Methylene blue stained normal saline was injected through the proximal opening of <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> during mechanical ventilation as well as spontaneous breathing. We monitored regurgitation of ICG with a flexible fiberscope (FO) inserted through the <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> and checked for the appearance of methylene blue in the mask bowl with the FO inserted through the airway tube. Results: In thirty-six patients with an i-Gel ™ and 37 with a LMA-S no regurgitation of ICG was observed {{at the level of}} the upper oeso-phageal sphincter (UES).

40|$|Objective 　To {{explore a}} {{rational}} method of placing appropriate pancreatic drainage after pancreaticoduodenectomy, and evaluate its safety and feasibility. Methods 　Classic Bernoulli's flowing mechanics energy equation (Bernoulli's equation) {{was used to}} calculate the dynamics of pancreatic juice flowing inside of the <b>drainage</b> <b>tube.</b> With given constant flowing velocity and density of pancreatic juice, four related factors on ΔP(pressure difference between entrance and exit planes of <b>drainage</b> <b>tube)</b> were investigated viarehearsing the formula. Effects on draining velocity by diameter and length of the tube were further verified by use of self-made pancreas drainage simulator, as well as the impact of liquid level difference on ΔP. Results 　Data obtained from calculation elucidated that the rank of 4 related factors was as follows: inner diameter﹥liquid level difference﹥liquid viscosity﹥tube length. The experiment also verified that the influence of draining velocity depended more on diameter rather than length. Liquid level difference was identified as major independent impact factor on ΔP. Conclusions 　Tube calibre ranging 1. 5 - 2. 0 mm to allow a continuity of liquid flow is an essential factor to promise a fluent drainage.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe use of {{surgical}} drains in abdominal surgery still remains controversial. While accepting {{their role in}} certain circumstances, their systematic use advocated by other schools, is not fully accepted. The case is presented of a caecal perforation secondary to a <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> in the perineum following an abdominal-perineal amputation of the rectum in a cancer patient that required surgical repair. Clinical caseThis is a patient who underwent abdominal-perineal resection for rectal neoplasia. It was decided to leave a silicone-type drain tube in the perineum, and in late postoperative he presented with a caecal perforation due to traumatic introduction of the <b>drainage</b> <b>tube,</b> which required further surgery to repair it. DiscussionThere {{is a tendency to}} use less and less drains in abdominal surgery, although there are certain occasions when it becomes unavoidable. On the other hand, the morbidity associated with its use significantly complicates and delays the recovery of the patient. It is accepted that is not useful to prevent the occurrence of fistulas, although it contributes to its early detection. ConclusionsCaecal perforation due to a <b>drainage</b> <b>tube</b> is a rare complication, which must always be taken into account, and that perhaps could be avoided by using soft and less rigid drains...|$|R
