5|$|<b>Crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{gathered}} in New York {{to witness the}} historic arrival, {{with tens of thousands}} of people crowding Battery Park in Manhattan to have a good view of the Statue of Liberty, where the aircraft was scheduled to touch down. Rumors circulated that L'Oiseau Blanc had been sighted along its route, in Newfoundland, or over Long Island. In France, some newspapers even reported that Nungesser and Coli had arrived safely in New York, evoking a wave of French patriotism. L'Oiseau Blanc had been carrying a sizable load of fuel, , which would have given them approximately 42 hours of flight time. After this time had passed, with no word as to the aircraft's fate, it was realized that the aircraft had been lost. In France, the public was scandalized by the newspapers such as La Presse which had printed false reports about the aircraft's arrival, and outrage was generated against the companies involved, with demonstrations in the streets.|$|E
5|$|The hasty {{departure}} from Manchester degenerated into chaos. Mechanical failures {{and a lack}} of space to turn the locomotives meant that the seven trains on the northern track were unable {{to get out of the}} station. Only three carriages—the Duke's among them—managed to leave successfully. At around 6.30pm the Duke arrived in Roby, and went to spend the night at the Marquess of Salisbury's house at Childwall Hall. Meanwhile, the remaining 24 passenger carriages were eventually lashed together with rope and fastened to the three locomotives which remained usable, which hauled this single long train, carrying around 600 passengers, out of Manchester at a speed of around 5mph (8km/h), further slowed by <b>crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> standing on the tracks and by grit and mud settling on the rails.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{discussion}} of tulip mania {{began with the}} book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, published in 1841 by the Scottish journalist Charles Mackay; he proposed that <b>crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> often behave irrationally, and tulip mania was, along with the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Company scheme, one of his primary examples. His account was largely sourced from a 1797 work by Johann Beckmann titled A History of Inventions, Discoveries, and Origins. In fact, Beckmann's account, and thus Mackay's by derivation, was primarily sourced to three anonymous pamphlets published in 1637 with an anti-speculative agenda. Mackay's vivid book was popular among generations of economists and stock market participants. His popular but flawed description of tulip mania as a speculative bubble remains prominent, even though since the 1980s economists have debunked many aspects of his account.|$|E
5|$|Antonio Ezequiel {{was killed}} by the Mexican Navy at around 6:00p.m. in {{downtown}} Matamoros on 5 November 2010, but the roadblocks set by organized crime continued {{throughout the rest of}} the day. The drug lord had reportedly called for backup when he was surrounded by the Navy, but when he was killed, his reinforcements from Reynosa, Tamaulipas (which consisted of over 80 SUVs filled with gunmen) dispersed. The international bridges in Matamoros were reopened by 7:00p.m. after <b>crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> had waited all afternoon. In Reynosa at around 9:15p.m., a grenade exploded inside a vehicle parked outside Plaza Real, the busiest shopping center in the city and just four miles away from the Hidalgo–Reynosa International Bridge. Reynosa also reported several shootings between the Mexican Army and organized crime on the highway that connects the city with the border town of Matamoros. In the municipalities of San Fernando, Río Bravo, Jaumave, Díaz Ordaz, Nuevo Laredo, Ciudad Mier, Guerrero, Miguel Alemán, Valle Hermoso, and Ciudad Victoria, most of the daily city activities were cancelled throughout the whole day. Organized crime gunmen and risk situations were reported in these areas, too.|$|E

25|$|It {{was into}} this {{environment}} and social milieu that trade union leader James Larkin (a Liverpool-born Irish Catholic) arrived in January 1907.

Addressing <b>crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> on the steps of Belfast's Custom House, he vociferously articulated the grievances of the working classes. Due to his charismatic personality and considerable oratorial skill, Larkin succeeded in unionising the unskilled Protestant and Catholic workers.|$|E

During the second verse, Eve is shown sitting on bleachers within another <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> while a basketball game goes on.

25|$|On 5 May 1945, Denmark {{was officially}} free of German control. Citizens {{all over the}} country took black shades used to cover their window during bombing raids, and burned them in the streets. Allied troops (mostly Soviet soldiers) were {{released}} from prisons {{all over the country}} and paraded down streets in Copenhagen, Aarhus, and other cities. In Aarhus, young girls known to have had relationships with German soldiers were dragged into streets by citizens in front of <b>crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> and had most of the hair on their heads cut off. They would then be forced to march down streets to be humiliated.|$|E
25|$|The first donuts popular {{until the}} 16th century {{were made of}} the same dough as bread, filled with pork and fried on smalec. Only later they were made sweet. Every respectful cake shop makes pączki {{the night before the}} Poles hit the shops to buy them. Polish pączki are made of yeast, flour and eggs, and fried in oil or smalec only briefly, until they rise up, so that the fat would not soak inside. Some people fill a few of them with almond or nut instead of marmalade; a chance {{encounter}} is supposed to bring good luck. Even though during Easter many housewives make pączki and faworki at home, one can see <b>crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> at confectioneries buying this Fat Thursday’s specialty.|$|E
25|$|Since {{its heyday}} {{at the turn}} of the 19th and 20th centuries, many of the large homes built here have been replaced, {{modified}} or abandoned with many lots subdivided. One reason that the colonia declined was the building of Line 2 of the Metro along Ribera de San Cosme Avenue, making this street a main corridor for the city. This bought in <b>crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> which then led to the construction of stores, hotels and nightclubs, which was often unregulated. This, in turn, caused many of the area’s wealthier residents to move out. The Circuito Interior was constructed in 1973. The 1985 Mexico City earthquake did significant damage here, and buildings since then have fallen due to structural damage related to the quake.|$|E
