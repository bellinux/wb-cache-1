5000|$|A <b>contribution</b> <b>claim</b> is a claim {{brought by}} one or more {{defendants}} to a lawsuit for money damages brought by a plaintiff. A <b>contribution</b> <b>claim</b> asserts the party (usually a defendant) is entitled to [...] "contribution" [...] from a third party for any money damages awarded to the plaintiff.|$|E
50|$|In {{some state}} court systems, a <b>contribution</b> <b>claim</b> must be opened {{as a new}} case, and thus the {{defendant}} must pay for a filing fee, docket number, or index number. In other states, however, no additional fee is required.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, {{contribution}} {{claims are}} brought like the original lawsuit itself. The claim must be personally {{served on the}} new, third party defendant, by the third party plaintiff (the defendant bringing the claim for contribution relief). In contrast, a counter-claim asserts that the party (usually a defendant) is entitled to offset the damages awarded to plaintiff by the proportionate share of any responsibility, liability, or fault assigned to the plaintiff by the jury. Finally, a cross-claim {{is the same as}} a counter-claim or <b>contribution</b> <b>claim,</b> except that it is asserted by a defendant against other defendants. Counter-claims and cross claims do not require personal service because no new parties are being added to the lawsuit.|$|E

40|$|The phrase 'religion and politics' conjures unsettling {{images of}} fiery-eyed zealots, in Protestant America or the Muslim Middle-East. Such religiously-inspired {{political}} activity is usually {{assumed to be}} a feature of societies where religion is prominent in national and cultural life. The presumed antidote, particularly from a European point of view, has been secularization: surely, if people in general cared less about religion, religious politics would fade from public life and its threatened disruptions would disappear. This view rests too much on historical specificities. Very secular societies can foster their own varieties of religious extremism, entering the public square in ways which are covert rather than overt, but no less unsettling for that. Very secular societies also pose searching questions for those wishing to develop theologically-based contributions to such societies' public debate. What legitimacy can a theologically-based <b>contribution</b> <b>claim</b> where Christianity commands no automatic attention? How should theologically-grounded voices pitch themselves in order to be heard, without succumbing to either (a) nostalgia for a time when Christian/Christendom assumptions could enter the public sphere uncontested or (b) covert hegemonic aspirations? Recent Australian politics provides a case study of both pitfalls and prospects. 19 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Environmental Protection Agency {{may enter}} into an {{agreement}} either {{to finance the}} cleanup of hazardous waste sites or to limit the liability of certain parties that {{may be responsible for}} the damage at the site in question. These agreements, referred to as consent decrees, generally contain provisions that protect the signing polluters from contribution claims brought by non-settling parties. This Case Note addresses whether non-settling parties should be able to move to intervene in a consent decree under a statutory right of contribution. On this issue, the courts are split. One line of reasoning holds that a non-settling party may not intervene because such an action would interfere with congressional intent. The converse line of reasoning holds that a non-settling party may intervene to protect its claim of contribution. The Case Note examines United States v. Union Electric, a leading case recently decided by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that a party may intervene to protect a <b>contribution</b> <b>claim.</b> United States v. Alcan Aluminum, Inc., a leading case from the Third Circuit holding to the contrary, is also discussed. The author concludes that the ruling of Union Electric has a more logical analysis and that the denial of intervention to non-settling parties is an incorrect interpretation of the present law...|$|E

In 1920 Parliament did found a central control board, the Film Inspection Board, to monitor films to protect children's sensibilities. However, in contrast to many other western countries there was no obligatory censorship involved. The Belgian government did only intervene exceptionally in public to control certain newsreels. Although Belgium did not have a tradition of film censorship and newsreels even enjoyed additional protection, this <b>contribution</b> <b>claims</b> that reality was more complex. Several mechanisms were created that enabled the government and the Film Inspection Board to control and even censor newsreels and topical documentaries during the interwar period...|$|R
40|$|After {{several decades}} of {{official}} disinterest, contemporary history became a popular topic of Portuguese historiography {{in the late}} 1970 s. However, attention was often directed towards socio-political aspects, with legal and constitutional aspects barely being examined at all. Although the situation has not changed dramatically, the area benefits indirectly from the interest that is being shown in the period. The following text brings together a group of works which deal, more or less directly, with the legal and institutional framework of 19 th-century Portuguese history. The lack of any systematic treatment of the subject makes a synthesis or a critical bibliography far too hazardous a task, so that this <b>contribution</b> <b>claims</b> to {{be little more than}} an organized list of titles, with some brief comments...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on Industrial Marketing {{scholarship}} and academe. This paper examines the neglected study of academic contribution. We review the discourse on what contributes a contribution and propose a framework that brings together disparate discussion of four main types of contribution which we refer to as, incremental, revelatory, replicatory and consolidatory. Nine sub-categories of contribution strategy are offered within these four main areas and are then forward to conduct a systematic review of industrial marketing scholarship. As an aid to better scholarship, these categories form the parameters of a review of the rhetorical acts of authors in framing <b>contribution</b> <b>claims.</b> Through this approach the paper offers conclusions as to the blend of contribution strategies by scholars within Industrial Marketing scholarship. We find that while incremental gap-spotting strategies are dominant, a healthy box-breaking mentality exists in the IM community...|$|R

This <b>contribution</b> <b>claims</b> that, for {{the leaders of the}} neoliberal global market and finance, the searched political solution for its crisis is how to change everything without changing anything. The construction of Europe appears a de facto laboratory for experiments aimed at this objective. For the European Union is using in different fields forms of democracy whose specificity is to imply participants (peoples, actors, organizations, national political elites) in a game in which they control neither the rules, nor the data, the agendas, or the outcomes. The contribution reviews a series of these forms; which describe passages to a-democracy in the current crisis. " (author's abstract...|$|R
40|$|Several <b>contributions</b> <b>claim</b> {{that the}} {{manufacturing}} and logistics performance measurement system (PMS) {{should be designed}} according to a principle of alignment between the com-petitive strategy and the operations strategy. This paper aims at verifying whether PMS of manufacturing plants are actually designed and used {{as stated in the}} academic literature. After a review of the most influential literature on this topic, we discuss the empirical findings of a qualitative study conducted through a case-based methodology. The findings highlight that, although operations managers of the observed plants state that they are committed to the improvement of the manufacturing and logistics performances more relevant in the client’s perspective, there is a misalignment between the improvement priorities and the functional PMS of the plants observed in this study. Such phenomenon depends on two factors: a perception of operations managers about their responsibility on specific performances; the availability of technologies, managerial tools and practices suitable for improving specific performances...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe CK theory {{developed}} by Hatchuel, Weil and Le Masson has raised interest and controversies {{in the academic}} and practitioners' communities. This paper is participating to this debate. After presenting the scope, focus, and the <b>contributions</b> <b>claimed</b> by its creators; the authors analyse the interest of considering also other concepts and models usually integrated in traditional design knowledge and practices. Indeed, it can be noticed that important concepts such as the concepts of function and structure for example seems to remain outside the perimeter of CK even if {{some of them are}} integrated in the research programs of the authors. This is not a central limitation if the real scope of the theory will be minimized, compared with the initial ambition of the CK's creators. It is nevertheless a fruitful contribution which explicitly creates a distinction between knowledge, concepts and notes the importance of expanding partition. The present contribution proposes to enrich the initial scope of CK by integrating theoretical contributions made by other authors and by considering concepts widely used and accepted in engineering design...|$|R
40|$|URL] audienceThe CK {{theory of}} design created by Hatchuel and Weil has raised {{interest}} and controversies {{both in the}} academic community and among practitioners. After presenting the scope and focus of CK theory, and the <b>contributions</b> <b>claimed</b> for it by its creators, we compare it to concepts and models more commonly used in traditional design approaches. It can be noticed that important concepts are ignored by CK theory, even if {{some of them are}} integrated into the research programs of Hatchuel, Weil, and Le Masson. This initial analysis demonstrates that even in its scope, CK theory appears incomplete for engineering design and does not consider important dimensions of the validity of the research program as claimed. Then we analyze the foundations and hypotheses of CK theory from a critical viewpoint. Some suggestions for its improvement are made. Additionally, the ability of CK theory both to effectively assist and direct the creative process and, moreover, to organize the complete design and innovation processes is questioned. Finally, we draw conclusions about the ambitious program and results claimed by the creators of CK theory...|$|R
40|$|Rational choice {{approaches}} to {{customary international law}} have gained in prominence in recent years. Although becoming increasingly sophisticated, they {{are not able to}} explain all phenomena of customary international law. This <b>contribution</b> <b>claims</b> that there are two different types of unwritten law in the international order. On the one hand, we have the traditional customary norms, which are identified by observing patterns of state conduct and a related opinio iuris. These norms may very well be described by rational choice approaches, which primarily observe under which conditions we may find stable patterns of behavior. However, there is, on the other hand, a different category of norms that functions in a different manner. These norms concern either human rights or public goods and can be considered as the principles of the international legal order. Their function is not to stabilize already existing behavioral equilibria, but to shape international relations in a positive way. They are not past-oriented, but future-directed. Therefore, it is the thesis of this contribution that a deliberative approach is more suitable to explain the role of these principles in the international community. -...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} the early modern Catholic {{missions}} to Asia provides an excellent vantage point to asses the relation between evangelization and colonialism. If the European expansion was an essential pre-condition {{for the creation of}} substantial Catholic communities in that continent, nonetheless the neophytes did not coincide for most of the time with colonial subjects and conversions usually did not take place in a context of coercion or moral pressure. However, native agency played a major role even in regions were Christianity was indeed enforced by a European imperial presence. The most conspicuous case is the one of the Portuguese Estado da Índia. Contrary to common assumptions, this <b>contribution</b> <b>claims</b> that the Portuguese established in Goa and in similar areas a “dominance without hegemony” and that Christianity endowed the Goan local elites with tools to play strategically and cunningly with the colonial power. Furthermore, the case of the Brahman cleric Mateus de Castro Mahalo is presented here as a striking example of a native Christian able to move through transcontinental spaces and live in a polycentric world thanks to his location in a “preter-colonial” space. On the basis of similar instances, further researches on the history of Christianity in Asia, stressing the role of native agency even in the early modern age, are particularly necessary...|$|R
