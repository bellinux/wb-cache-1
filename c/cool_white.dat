5|$|Most {{observed}} white dwarfs {{have relatively}} high surface temperatures, between 8,000K and 40,000K. A white dwarf, though, spends {{more of its}} lifetime at cooler temperatures than at hotter temperatures, so we should expect {{that there are more}} <b>cool</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs than hot white dwarfs. Once we adjust for the selection effect that hotter, more luminous white dwarfs are easier to observe, we do find that decreasing the temperature range examined results in finding more white dwarfs. This trend stops when we reach extremely <b>cool</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4,000K, and one of the coolest so far observed, WD 0346+246, has a surface temperature of approximately 3,900K. The {{reason for this is that}} the Universe's age is finite; there has not been enough time for white dwarfs to cool below this temperature. The white dwarf luminosity function can therefore be used to find the time when stars started to form in a region; an estimate for the age of our Galactic disk found in this way is 8 billion years. A white dwarf will eventually, in many trillions of years, cool and become a non-radiating black dwarf in approximate thermal equilibrium with its surroundings and with the cosmic background radiation. No black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.|$|E

25|$|Two former {{employees}} of Toyō Itō, Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa formed a collaborative partnership in 1995 called SANAA. They {{are known for}} creating lightweight, transparent spaces that expose the fluidity and movement of their occupants. Their Dior store in Shibuya, Tōkyō, in 2001 was reminiscent of Itō's Mediatheque, with <b>cool</b> <b>white</b> acrylic sheets on the external facade that filter the light and partially reveal the store's contents. Their dynamic of fluidity is demonstrated by the Rolex Learning Centre at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, completed in 2010. This building has an undulating floor plane set under a continuous concrete shell roof that was poured in one go over two days. The plan is like a biological cell punctuated with tables and courtyards alike. In 2009 they designed the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion in London that comprised a reflective, floating aluminium roof supported by slender columns.|$|E

50|$|WD 0346+246 is a {{white dwarf}} in the {{ecliptic}} constellation of Taurus.

40|$|Extending the {{population}} synthesis method to isolated young <b>cooling</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs {{we are able}} to confront our model assumptions with observations made in ROSAT All-Sky Survey (Fleming et al., 1996). This allows us to check model parameters such as evolution of spectra and separation of heavy elements in DA WD envelopes. It seems like X-ray spectrum temperature of these objects is given by the formula T_X-ray = min(T_eff, T_max). We have obtained DA WD's birth rate and upper limit of the X-ray spectrum temperature: DA birth rate = 0. 61 × 10 ^- 12 in cubic parsec per year and T_max = 41000 K. These values are in good correspondence with values obtained by other authors (Liebert et al., 2004; Wolff et al., 1996). From this fact we also conclude that our population synthesis method is applicable to {{the population}} of close-by isolated <b>cooling</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs {{as well as to the}} population of the isolated cooling neutron stars.

50|$|A {{black dwarf}} is a {{theoretical}} stellar remnant, specifically a white dwarf that has cooled sufficiently that {{it no longer}} emits significant heat or light. Because the time required for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (13.8 billion years), no black dwarfs are expected to exist in the universe yet, and the temperature of the <b>coolest</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs is one observational limit on the age of the universe.|$|R

25|$|Since the {{universe}} {{must be at}} least as old as the oldest thing in it, {{there are a number of}} observations which put a lower limit on the age of {{the universe}}; these include the temperature of the <b>coolest</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs, which gradually cool as they age, and the dimmest turnoff point of main sequence stars in clusters (lower-mass stars spend a greater amount of time on the main sequence, so the lowest-mass stars that have evolved off of the main sequence set a minimum age).|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} brief summary of what is {{currently}} known about white dwarf stars, {{with an emphasis on}} their evolutionary and internal properties. As is well known, white dwarfs represent the end products of stellar evolution {{for the vast majority of}} stars and, as such, bear the signatures of past events (such as mass loss, mixing phases, loss and redistribution of angular momentum, and thermonuclear burning) that are of essential importance in the evolution of stars in general. In addition, white dwarf stars represent ideal testbeds for our understanding of matter under extreme conditions, and work on their constitutive physics (neutrino production rates, conductive and radiative opacities, interior liquid/solid equations of state, partially ionized and partially degenerate envelope equations of state, diffusion coefficients, line broadening mechanisms) is still being actively pursued. Given a set of constitutive physics, <b>cooling</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs can be used advantageously as cosmochronometers. Moreover, the field has been blessed by the existence of four distinct families of pulsating white dwarfs, each mapping a different evolutionary phase, and this allows the application of the asteroseismological method to probe and test their internal structure and evolutionary state. We set the stage for the reviews that follow on <b>cooling</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs as cosmochronometers and physics laboratories, as well as on the properties of pulsating white dwarfs and the asteroseismological results that can be inferred...|$|R

50|$|The Urca {{process is}} {{especially}} important in the <b>cooling</b> of <b>white</b> dwarfs, where a lepton (usually an electron) is absorbed by the nucleus of an ion and then convectively carried away from {{the core of a}} star.
