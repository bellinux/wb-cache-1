Increasing amounts of an industrial product made by thermal lysis of yeast cell walls were added to two red wines: the effects on phenolic and coloring fraction were studied, in relation to bottle storage. The effects on wine color and astringency, showed strongly dependence to {{the characteristics of the}} wine and to the dosage; they were limited to short times of conservation. In fact, a loss in the positive effects on color intensity was observed during the bottle storage, probably {{as a result of the}} modifications in the <b>colloidal</b> <b>equilibrium</b> during conservation.

40|$|The present {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the modification of a 160 / 220 bituminous binder with clay and polymer/clay nanocomposites. Bitumen/polymer/clay ternary blends were prepared using styrene–butadiene–styrene, ethylene vinyl acetate and ethylene methylacrylate copolymers mixed with an organomodified montmorillonite. Dynamic mechanical analyses were performed in the extended domain of stress, temperature and frequency to analyse the thermorheological behaviour of the blends. The time–temperature superposition principle was applied to shift the experimental data recorded at different temperatures and generate master curves of the linear viscoelastic functions. For all blends, the mechanical response of the system {{was found to be}} strongly and intimately influenced by the nanocomposite modification. In some cases, a solid-like behaviour appears and delays the Newtonian transition. Morphological analyses performed with fluorescence microscopy allowed to associate the binder properties with the presence of clay silicates, which alter the <b>colloidal</b> <b>equilibrium</b> of the bitumen and enhances the compatibility between bitumen and polymers. Based on the morphological and rheological results, a structural model of the prepared blends is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Polymer {{modified}} asphalts (PMA) {{and warm}} mix asphalts (WMA) are technologies widely {{adopted in the}} paving industry. The first one is well established, while the second one is relatively new, but rapidly growing since it guarantees economic and environmental advantages. Until now PMA and WMA have been used disjointedly, {{but it would be}} useful to combine them to keep the advantages of both. One of the adopted solutions to obtain a warm effect is the addition of waxes to the asphaltic binder. Therefore, a ‘‘warm mix polymer modified asphalt’’ may be potentially obtained with a ternary asphalt/polymer/wax system. However, the final warm effect and performances of the binder will depend on the interactions between the three components. A preliminary investigation was done by mixing asphalt, styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer and a wax chosen among the following three categories: paraffinic, partially oxidized and maleic anhydride functionalized. The morphological and calorimetric analyses and solubility tests allowed identifying different behaviors depending on the wax type, which may preferentially interact either with the asphalt or with the polymer, thus influencing the whole binder structure. With regard to the ternary mixes, it was found that: (i) the paraffinic wax preferentially resides in the polymer- rich phase, and slightly enhances the asphalt-polymer compatibility; (ii) the partially oxidized wax prefers the asphaltene-rich phase and reduces the compatibility; (iii) it is not clear where the functionalized wax is located, but it has a considerable compatibilizing effect and strongly alters the <b>colloidal</b> <b>equilibrium</b> of the asphalt-polymer blend.

40|$|A simple {{manner to}} {{describe}} the diffusive relaxation of a colloidal fluid adsorbed in a porous medium is to model the porous medium {{as a set of}} spherical particles fixed in space at random positions with prescribed statistical structural properties. Within this model one may describe the relaxation of concentration fluctuations of the adsorbed fluid by simply setting to zero the short-time mobility of one species (the porous matrix) in a theory of the dynamics of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>colloidal</b> mixtures, or by extending such dynamic theory to explicitly consider the porous matrix as a random external field.

40|$|International audienceLiving active matter {{systems such}} as {{bacterial}} colonies, schools of fish and human crowds, display a wealth of emerging collective and dynamic behaviours {{as a result of}} far-from-equilibrium interactions. The dynamics of these systems are better understood and controlled considering their interaction with the environment, which for realistic systems is often highly heterogeneous and disordered. Here, we demonstrate that the presence of spatial disorder can alter the long-term dynamics in a colloidal active matter system, making it switch between gathering and dispersal of individuals. At <b>equilibrium,</b> <b>colloidal</b> particles always gather at the bottom of any attractive potential; however, under non-equilibrium driving forces in a bacterial bath, the colloids disperse if disorder is added to the potential. The depth of the local roughness in the environment regulates the transition between gathering and dispersal of individuals in the active matter system, thus inspiring novel routes for controlling emerging behaviours far from equilibrium...|$|R

At <b>equilibrium,</b> all the observables are stationary while in the out-of-equilibrium glassy state they have an explicit dependence on the age of the system. We find that the transport coefficients scale with the aging-time as a power-law, a signature of the slow relaxation. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals that the glassy system has thermalized at a constant temperature independent of the age and larger than the bath, reflecting the structural rearrangements of cage-dynamics. Furthermore, a universal scaling law is found to describe the global and local fluctuations of the observables. Comment: 33 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

40|$|In <b>equilibrium,</b> <b>colloidal</b> {{suspensions}} {{governed by}} short-range attractive and long-range repulsive interactions form thermodynamically stable clusters. Using Brownian dynamics computer simulations, we investigate how this equilibrium clustering is affected when such particles are self-propelled. We {{find that the}} clustering process is stable under self-propulsion. For the range of interaction parameters studied and at low particle density, the cluster size increases {{with the speed of}} self-propulsion (activity) and for higher activity the cluster size decreases, showing a non-monotonic variation of cluster size with activity. This clustering behaviour is distinct from the pure kinetic (or motility-induced) clustering of self-propelling particles which is observed at significantly higher activities and densities. We present an equilibrium model incorporating the effect of activity as activity-induced attraction and repulsion by imposing that the strength of these interactions depend on activity superlinearly. The model explains the cluster size dependence of activity obtained from simulations semi-quantitatively. Our predictions are verifiable in experiments on interacting synthetic colloidal microswimmersComment: 8 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} we used tunable particle-particle and particle-substrate {{attraction to}} achieve reversible two-dimensional crystallization of colloids on homogeneous and patterned substrates. Total internal reflection and video microscopy techniques {{were used to}} quantify the interparticle and particle-substrate interactions in these <b>colloidal</b> systems. <b>Equilibrium</b> and dynamic simulations were then utilized to link these colloidal interactions to the experimental colloidal phase behaviour. The importance {{of the nature of}} the attractive interaction in successfully crystallizing colloids has also been documented. The first set of experiments demonstrates the use of temperature and specific ion effects to reversibly control the net particle-substrate van der Waals (vdW) attraction. Colloidal stabilization was achieved via the use of adsorbed polymer brush layers. By using evanescent wave microscopy, we directly and precisely measured how temperature and specific ion effects control the dimensions of adsorbed polymer layers and hence the net van der Waals attraction in between the colloids and the substrate. However, the magnitude of the van der Waals attraction decays very rapidly with increasing surface separation and is therefore not conducive to the self assembly of colloidal crystals. We successfully used thermoresponsive polymer nanoparticles to control the depletion attraction between micron sized silica particles and thereby induced reversible crystallization of the micron sized silica colloids on homogeneous substrates. Video and evanescent wave microscopy techniques were used to measure the nanoparticle-induced attractive interaction as a function of temperature. The experimentally observed phase behaviour was verified via simulations that utilized knowledge of the measured colloidal depletion interactions. Finally, patterned surface topologies were used to position attractive colloidal crystals. Simulations were used to link the measured colloidal interactions to experimental phase behaviour as well as substrate topology. An extension of the concepts developed in this dissertation might suggest a general strategy to assemble colloidal particles into robust and annealable crystals contributing to the fabrication of photonic bandgap materials...|$|R
40|$|The phase {{behavior}} of colloids that interact via competing interactions - short-range attraction and long-range repulsion - is studied by computer simulation. In particular, for a fixed strength {{and range of}} repulsion, {{the effect of the}} strength of an attractive interaction (epsilon) on the phase behavior is investigated at various colloid densities (rho). A thermodynamically stable <b>equilibrium</b> <b>colloidal</b> cluster phase, consisting of compact crystalline clusters, is found below the fluid-solid coexistence line in the epsilon-rho parameter space. The mean cluster size is found to linearly increase with the colloid density. At large epsilon and low densities, and at small epsilon and high densities, a non-equilibrium cluster phase, consisting of elongated Bernal spiral-like clusters, is observed. Although gelation can be induced either by increasing epsilon at constant density or vice versa, the gelation mechanism is different in either route. While in the rho route gelation occurs via a glass transition of compact clusters, gelation in the epsilon route is characterized by percolation of elongated clusters. This study both provides the location of equilibrium and non-equilibrium cluster phases with respect to the fluid-solid coexistence, and reveals the dependencies of the gelation mechanism on the preparation route...|$|R
40|$|The Kibble-Zurek {{mechanism}} {{describes the}} evolution of topological defect structures like domain walls, strings, and monopoles when a system is driven through a second order phase transition. The model is used on very different scales like the Higgs field {{in the early universe}} or quantum fluids in condensed matter systems. A defect structure naturally arises during cooling if separated regions are too far apart to `communicate' (e. g. about their orientation or phase) due to finite signal velocity. This results in separated domains with different (degenerated) locally broken symmetry. Within this picture we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics in a condensed matter analogue, a two-dimensional ensemble of <b>colloidal</b> particles. In <b>equilibrium</b> it obeys the so called Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) melting scenario with continuous (second-order like) phase transitions. The ensemble is exposed to a set of finite cooling rates covering roughly three orders of magnitude. Along this process, we analyze the defect and domain structure quantitatively via video microscopy and determine the scaling of the corresponding length scales {{as a function of the}} cooling rate. We indeed observe the scaling predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for the KTHNY universality class. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a series of}} experiments and computer simulations on vibrated granular media in a geometry chosen to eliminate gravitationally induced settling. The system consists {{of a collection of}} identical spherical particles on a horizontal plate vibrating vertically, with or without a confining lid. Previously reported results are reviewed, including the observation of homogeneous, disordered liquid-like states, an instability to a `collapse' of motionless spheres on a perfect hexagonal lattice, and a fluctuating, hexagonally ordered state. In the presence of a confining lid we see a variety of solid phases at high densities and relatively high vibration amplitudes, several of which are reported {{for the first time in}} this article. The phase behavior of the system is closely related to that observed in confined hard-sphere <b>colloidal</b> suspensions in <b>equilibrium,</b> but with modifications due to the effects of the forcing and dissipation. We also review measurements of velocity distributions, which range from Maxwellian to strongly non-Maxwellian depending on the experimental parameter values. We describe measurements of spatial velocity correlations that show a clear dependence on the mechanism of energy injection. We also report new measurements of the velocity autocorrelation function in the granular layer and show that increased inelasticity leads to enhanced particle self-diffusion.

40|$|Spatial {{confinement}} of a near-critical medium {{changes its}} fluctuation spectrum and modifies the corresponding order parameter distribution. These effects result in effective, so-called critical Casimir forces (CCFs) {{acting on the}} confining surfaces. These forces are attractive for like boundary conditions of the order parameter at the opposing surfaces of the confinement. For colloidal particles dissolved in a binary liquid mixture acting as a solvent close to its critical point of demixing, one thus expects the emergence of phase segregation into <b>equilibrium</b> <b>colloidal</b> liquid and gas phases. We analyze how such phenomena occur asymmetrically in the whole thermodynamic neighborhood of the consolute point of the binary solvent. By applying field-theoretical methods within mean-field approximation and the semi-empirical de Gennes-Fisher functional, we study the CCFs acting between planar parallel walls {{as well as between}} two spherical colloids and their dependence on temperature and on the composition of the near-critical binary mixture. We find that for compositions slightly poor in the molecules preferentially adsorbed at the surfaces, the CCFs are significantly stronger than at the critical composition, thus leading to pronounced colloidal segregation. The segregation phase diagram of the colloid solution following from the calculated effective pair potential between the colloids agrees surprisingly well with experiments and simulations...|$|R
40|$|Underdamped {{stochastic}} thermodynamics {{provides a}} handy tool {{to study a}} large class of stochastic processes operating out of <b>equilibrium.</b> <b>Colloidal</b> particles in a laser trap, molecular motors and feedback processes {{are some of the}} prominent examples. In the present work we give a mathematical framework {{for the study of the}} thermodynamic properties of these phenomena. We focus on Markovian stochastic processes in continuous time and space, and show how the techniques of equivalent measures combined with stochastic solutions of partial differential equations, obtained through Feynman-Kac formula, can be used to derive exact relations between forward and backward diffusion processes. We prove a theorem which allows us to derive the time evolution of an arbitrary path quantity in a simple and systematic way. We further consider a fairly general underdamped stochastic model, and study its nonequilibrium thermodynamic properties at both single trajectory and average levels. For this model, we establish several integral and detailed fluctuation theorems for thermodynamic quantities such as work and entropy production, amongst others. Some of these theorems directly parallel those already obtained in the context of overdamped and master equations, while others are novel. We also discuss some special cases of our model which are directly related to physical systems such as active Brownian particles, feedback processes and isoenergetic stochastic processes.

40|$|Chemically and {{physically}} patterned surfaces {{can be used}} as templates to guide nano- and micro- scale particle assembly, but the design is often limited by an inability to sufficiently characterize how pattern features influence local particle-surface interactions on the order of thermal energy, kT. The research outlined in this dissertation describes comprehensive optical microscopy (i. e. evanescent wave, video) measurements and analyses of many-body and multi-dimensional interactions, dynamics and structure in inhomogeneous colloidal fluid systems. In particular, I demonstrate how non-intrusive observation of an ensemble of particles diffusing past each other and over a physically patterned surface topography can be used to obtain sensitive images of energy landscape features. I also link diffusing colloidal probe dynamics to energy landscape features, which is important for understanding the temporal imaging process and self-assembly kinetics. A complementary effort in this dissertation investigated the use of external AC electric fields to reversibly tune colloidal interactions to produce metastable ordered configurations. In addition, the electrical impedance spectra associated with colloidal assemblies formed between interfacial microelectrode gaps was measured and consistently modelled using representative equivalent circuits. Significant results from this dissertation include the synergistic use of the very same colloids as both imaging probes and building blocks in feedback controlled selfassembly on patterns. Cycling the AC field frequencies was found to be an effective way to anneal <b>equilibrium</b> <b>colloidal</b> configurations. Quantitative predictions of dominant transport mechanisms as a function of AC electric field amplitude and frequency were able to consistently explain the steady-state colloidal microstructures formed within electrode gaps observed using video microscopy. A functional electrical switch using gold nanoparticles was realized by reversibly forming and breaking colloidal wires between electrode gaps.

40|$|In this {{research}} we illustrate how particle-particle and particle-substrate interactions affect structure in interfacial colloidal systems. A number of tools {{are used to}} quantify characteristics of deposited structures. These results help understand the effects of colloidal system interactions and deposition kinetics {{on the degree of}} ordering in interfacial colloidal structures. The first set of experiments involve 2. 34 ?m silica colloids interacting with silica substrates in 0 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, and 100 mM NaCl solutions. Only the 100 mM NaCl solution resulted in rapid deposition driven by van der Waals attraction, while residual electrostatic repulsion produced levitation at lower ionic strengths. This allowed direct observation of the effects of varying magnitudes of attractive interactions on interfacial colloidal structures. Rapid deposition of positively charged 1 ?m latex colloids on negatively charged silica substrates driven by Coulombic and van der Waals attraction produced surface structures similar to those obtained with only van der Waals attraction. Experiments on 2. 34 ?m silica colloids interacting with silica substrates in 10 mM NaCl/pH 5. 5 and 10 mM NaCl/pH 10 conditions resulted in slower deposition rates. It was also found that slower deposition rates produced more compact structures displaying a higher degree of order. Another set of experiments was aimed at understanding interactions and structures formed in systems of polymerically levitated particles. Total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM) experiments revealed the influence of underlying substrate chemistry on interaction profiles in these systems. Basic experiments were also performed on the effects of varying amounts of specific ions on the dispersion stability in these systems. At conditions producing instability in polymeric systems, a similar degree of order was observed in comparison to experiments involving rapid deposition via salt addition in electrostatically stabilized systems. The results of {{this research}} clearly indicate that particle-particle and particle-substrate interactions are critical in determining structure formation by deposition. While the principal focus of this research is to study structures formed in various kinetic regimes, it also provides a basis for future studies aimed at tuning attractive interactions to produce <b>equilibrium</b> <b>colloidal</b> crystals on substrates...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of concentrated temperature-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAM) microgel suspensions {{has been investigated}} employing rheology and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). A previously described model expression for the particle form factor Pinho(q) is extended by a model hard sphere structure factor S(q), and the average radial density profiles f(r) are calculated from the amplitude of the form factor A(q) and the structure factor S(q). By this procedure, a direct real space description of the spatial ordering {{in the neighborhood of}} a single particle is obtained. The overall particle size and the correlation length ¿ of the concentration fluctuations of the internal polymer network decrease with concentration, revealing the increasing compression of the spheres. Thus, the particle form factor Pinho(q) of the swollen PNiPAM microgels depends on concentration. The particle-particle interaction potential does not change significantly between 25 and 32 °C. Even approximately 1 K below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), the experimental scattering intensity distributions I(q) /c are described very well by the hard sphere structure factor when an equivalent hard sphere particle size RHS and volume fraction ¿HS are used. Microgels with different degrees of cross-linking and particle size resemble true hard sphere behavior up to effective volume fractions of feff 0. 35 strong deviations from true hard spheres are observed. Interpenetration of the outer, less cross-linked regions of the soft spheres as well as particle compression occurred at higher concentrations. In agreement with this, the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>colloidal</b> phase behavior and rheology also has some features of soft sphere systems. At temperatures well above the LCST, the interaction potential becomes strongly attractive and the collapsed microgel spheres form aggregates consisting of flocculated particles without significant long-range order. Hence, an attractive interaction potential in concentrated suspensions of PNiPAM microgels leads to distinctively different structures as compared to attractive hard sphere colloids. When the peculiar structural properties of the PNiPAM microgels are considered, they can be used as model systems in colloidal science...|$|R
40|$|A {{colloidal}} suspension {{is a small}} constituent of insoluble solid particles suspended in a liquid medium. Control over the wetting, evaporation, and deposition patterns left by {{colloidal suspension}}s is valuable in many biological, medical, industrial, and agricultural applications. Understanding the governing principles of wetting and evaporative phenomena of these colloidal suspensions may lead to greater control over resultant deposition patterns. Perhaps the most familiar pattern forms when an initially heterogeneous colloidal suspension leaves a dark ring pattern {{at the edge of}} a drop. This pattern is referred to as a coffee-stain and it can be seen from dried droplets of spilled coffee. This coffee-stain effect was first investigated by Deegan et. al. who discovered that these patterns occur when outward radial flows driven by evaporation at the triple contact line dominate over other effects. While the presence of coffee-stain patterns is undesirable in many printing and medical diagnostic processes, it can also be advantageous in the production of low cost transparent conductive films, the deposition of metal vapor, and the manipulation of biological structures. Controlling the interactions between the substrate, liquid, vapor, and particles can lead to control over the size and morphology of evaporative deposition patterns left by aqueous colloidal suspensions. Several methods have been developed to control the evaporation of colloidal suspensions to either suppress or enhance the coffee stain effect. Electrowetting on Dielectric (EWOD) is one promising method that has been used to control colloidal depositions by applying either an AC or DC electric field. EWOD actuation has the potential to dynamically control colloidal deposition left by desiccated droplets to either suppress or enhance the coffee stain effect. It may also allow for independent control of the fluidic interface and deposition of particles via electrowetting and electrokinetic forces. Implementation of this technique requires that the colloidal droplet be separated from the active electrode by a dielectric layer to prevent electrolysis. A variety of polymer layers have been used in EWOD devices for a variety of applications. In applications that involve desiccation of colloidal suspensions, the material for this layer should be chosen carefully as it can play an important role in the resulting deposition pattern. An experimental method to monitor the transient evolution of the shape of an evaporating colloidal droplet and optically quantify the resultant deposition pattern is presented. Unactuated colloidal suspensions will be desiccated on a variety of substrates commonly used in EWOD applications. Transient image profiles and particle deposition patterns are examined for droplets containing fluorescent micro-particles. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of these results will be used to compare multiple different cases in an effort to provide insight into the effects of polymer selection on the drying dynamics and resultant deposition patterns of desiccated colloidal materials. It was found that the equilibrium and receding contact angles between the surface and the droplet play a key role in the evaporation dynamics and the resulting deposition patterns left by a desiccated <b>colloidal</b> suspension. The <b>equilibrium</b> contact angle controls the initial contact diameter for a droplet of a given volume. As a droplet on a surface evaporates, the evolution of the interface shape and the contact diameter can generally be described by three different regimes. The Constant Contact Radius (CCR) regime occurs when the contact line is pinned while the contact angle decreases. The Constant Contact Angle (CCA) regime occurs when the contact line recedes while the contact angle remains constant. The Mixed regime occurs when the contact radius and angle both reduce over time. The presence of the CCA regime allows the contact line to recede creating a more uniform deposition. However, not all droplets move into the CCA regime. Some remain in the CCR regime creating a coffee-stain pattern. In order to transition into the CCA regime, the dynamic contact angle of the droplet must be reduced to an angle close to the receding contact angle. Transient interface shapes and deposition patterns were examined on four surfaces: (i) Glass, (ii) Kapton HN polyimide tape, (iii) SU- 8 3005, and (iv) Teflon AF. Glass has a low equilibrium contact angle and a very low receding contact angle resulting in a large uniform coffee-stain deposition. Kapton HN and SU- 8 3005 have similar equilibrium contact angles that result in similar initial contact diameters. However, Kapton HN pins at that initial diameter due to a low receding contact angle producing a smaller more intense coffee-stain. SU- 8 3005 has a large receding contact angle that allows for the transition into the CCA regime which results in a smaller, more uniform, and more intense spot. Teflon AF has the largest equilibrium and receding contact angle producing the smallest, most uniform, and most intense spot. Results presented here suggest that a lower receding contact angle is beneficial in areas where the coffee-stain effect needs to be enhanced while a larger receding contact angle is beneficial in areas where the coffee-stain needs to be suppressed. Preliminary results are also presented examining droplets actuated via AC electrowetting to examine the effect of electrode geometry and applied voltage on electrowetting behavior and colloidal depositions in these cases. It was found that the Young-Lippmann equation needs to be modified to satisfy the modified capacitance per unit area of a system with different electrode geometries...|$|R
