60|$|Lawford <b>clutched</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> as a {{blind man}} in sudden peril might clutch {{the hand of a}} child. He saw nothing clearly; spoke almost without {{understanding}} his words.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>clutched</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{to detain}} her. [...] "How are you, Watson?" [...] said he, cordially. [...] "I {{should never have}} known you under that moustache, and I dare say {{you would not be}} {{prepared}} to swear to me. This I presume is your celebrated friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Presently Albinia heard {{a strange}} sound as of {{tightened}} breath, {{and looking up}} saw Sophy deathly pale, with her {{eyes fixed on the}} window. In terror she flew to her side, but Sophy spoke not, she only <b>clutched</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> with fingers cold and tight as iron, and gazed with dilated eyes. Albinia looked-- ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>clutched</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> almost roughly {{and raised}} {{them to his}} lips.|$|R
60|$|He shivered. Nevertheless, he <b>clutched</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> {{and drew}} <b>her</b> closer to him.|$|R
60|$|David {{suddenly}} <b>clutched</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> He {{was a man}} again. He {{threw away}} his doubts. He accepted Paradise.|$|R
6000|$|He {{postponed}} departure {{as long as}} possible, and it was {{not until}} the end of April that he left for England. She came alone to see him off. It was drizzling, but her tall, slight figure in the golf cape looked impervious to cold and rain amongst the shivering natives. Desperately he <b>clutched</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> warm through the wet glove; her smile seemed heartless in its brilliancy. He whispered [...] "You will write?" ...|$|E
60|$|With roar and rumble, through {{daylight}} and dark, swaying and lurching between the dawns, soaring into the winter snows and sinking to summer valleys, skirting depths, leaping chasms, piercing mountains, Jees Uck and her boy were hurled south. But {{she had no}} fear of the iron stallion; nor was she stunned by this masterful civilization of Neil Bonner's people. It seemed, rather, that she saw with greater clearness the wonder that a man of such godlike race had held her in his arms. The screaming medley of San Francisco, with its restless shipping, belching factories, and thundering traffic, did not confuse her; instead, she comprehended swiftly the pitiful sordidness of Twenty Mile and the skin- lodged Toyaat village. And {{she looked down at}} the boy that <b>clutched</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and wondered that she had borne him by such a man.|$|E
6000|$|He {{rose from}} his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent over it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold as ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as he led her across the dusky room. On the faded green {{tapestry}} were broidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with their tiny hands waved to her to go back. [...] "Go back! little Virginia," [...] they cried, [...] "go back!" [...] but the ghost <b>clutched</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> more tightly, and {{she shut her eyes}} against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails and goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and murmured, [...] "Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again," [...] but the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When they {{reached the end of the}} room he stopped, and muttered some words she could not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly fading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A bitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her dress. [...] "Quick, quick," [...] cried the Ghost, [...] "or it will be too late," [...] and in a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry Chamber was empty.|$|E
60|$|Frona {{turned to}} St. Vincent {{as the last}} of the crowd filed out. He <b>clutched</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> spasmodically, like a {{drowning}} man.|$|R
6000|$|MURRAY (with a groan--protesting half-aloud in a strangled voice). No! No! It can't be----! My God! (He <b>clutches</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> {{and hides}} {{his face in}} them.) ...|$|R
60|$|Annabel <b>clutched</b> <b>her</b> sister's <b>hands.</b> The {{tears were}} {{streaming}} down her face, her voice was thick with sobs.|$|R
60|$|He {{rose from}} his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent over it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold as ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as he led her across the dusky room. On the faded green {{tapestry}} were broidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with their tiny hands waved to her to go back. 'Go back! little Virginia,' they cried, 'go back!' but the Ghost <b>clutched</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> more tightly, and {{she shut her eyes}} against them.

60|$|Her grasp {{interrupted}} him, and he {{felt the}} tightening <b>clutch</b> of <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> upon his arm in the gloom.|$|R
6000|$|Lanfear shouted. The madman flung Gerald to the ground, {{and fled}} shrieking. Miss Gerald had leaped from her seat, and {{followed}} Lanfear {{as he ran}} forward to the prostrate form. She {{did not look at}} it, but within a few paces she <b>clutched</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> in <b>her</b> hair, and screamed out: [...] "Oh, my mother is killed!" [...] and sank, as if sinking down into the earth, in a swoon.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Brown {{instantly}} {{directed the}} <b>clutch</b> of <b>her</b> right <b>hand</b> at his hair, and the <b>clutch</b> of <b>her</b> left <b>hand</b> at his throat, {{and held on}} to the object of her fond affection with such extraordinary fury, that his face began to blacken in a moment.|$|R
60|$|Birkin, {{white and}} strangely ghostly, {{went over to}} the carved figure of the negro woman in labour. Her nude, protuberant body {{crouched}} in a strange, <b>clutching</b> posture, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> gripping the ends of the band, above her breast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Seize her!" [...] {{suddenly}} {{shouted the}} King, and General Guph sprang forward to obey. Polychrome stood quite still, yet when Guph attempted to <b>clutch</b> <b>her</b> his <b>hands</b> met in air, {{and now the}} Rainbow's Daughter was {{in another part of}} the room, as smiling and composed as before.|$|R
60|$|Lady Carey disembarked, a {{complete}} wreck, {{leaning on the}} arm of her maid, and with a bottle of smelling salts <b>clutched</b> in <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> She slept all the way in the train, and only woke up when they were nearing Paris. She looked at Lucille in astonishment.|$|R
5000|$|Her sharp finger {{is said to}} be her {{forefinger}} on <b>her</b> right <b>hand.</b> The sharp finger {{resembled a}} spear or obsidian knife, which she used to cut her victims. Her mouth was stained with blood from the livers she ate. Often she <b>clutched</b> <b>her</b> right <b>hand</b> tightly, because <b>her</b> hidden heart and only weak spot was in her right palm.|$|R
60|$|He {{kissed her}} passionately. She yielded to his embrace, but almost {{immediately}} drew herself away. He <b>clutched</b> at <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> but she eluded him. With swift footsteps {{she crossed the}} lawn. Just as she reached the terrace, the windows opened once more and some one called her name.|$|R
60|$|Reassured {{as to the}} mouse, Maude {{approached}} with <b>her</b> saucepan still <b>clutched</b> in <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> There could be no doubt either as to the woman or the sleep. She lay in an untidy heap, her head under the table, and her figure sprawling. She {{appeared to be a}} very large woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is the money--so--and so--and so--that is correct. Please {{count it}} once more!--" [...] Alvina counted it {{and kept it}} <b>clutched</b> in <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] "And there are your rings, and your chain, and your locket--see--all--everything--! But not the brooch. Where is the brooch? Here! Shall I give it back, hein?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "Eavesdropping is {{listening}} through a key-hole, or around a corner. This is very different. Besides, it's Oliver, and he's {{been talking about}} ME. Hark!" [...] She <b>clutches</b> <b>her</b> friend's <b>hand,</b> where they have crouched upon the floor together, and pulls her forward to the register. [...] "Oh, dear, how hot it is! I wish they would cut off the heat down below." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{what is this}} prize {{that the}} {{trembling}} Venetia holds almost convulsively in her grasp, apparently without daring even to examine it? Is this the serene and light-hearted girl, whose face was like the cloudless splendour of a sunny day? Why is she so pallid and perturbed? What strong impulse fills <b>her</b> frame? She <b>clutches</b> in <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> a key! ...|$|R
50|$|Dom {{visits the}} grave of his wife Katherine and apologises. He turns and sees his {{grandson}} Jawara sitting next to him. He walks Jawara out of the cemetery and takes him back to Evelyn. He asks if he can walk with them in silence, but she says they have to hurry home. She says Dom can take Jawara to school on Monday if he doesn't get drunk on Sunday night. As they walk away, Jawara waves to Dom, who waves back. He walks {{in the opposite direction}} and sees Paolina enter a restaurant with an older man. He enters the restaurant and grips Paolina's hand. He whispers threats and continues to <b>clutch</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> before leaving he kisses her. As he leaves the restaurant, he smiles as it is revealed that he has stolen Paolina's diamond ring.|$|R
60|$|At {{sight of}} it she {{recalled}} the rifle and ammunition {{that the man had}} thrust upon her at the last moment. Until now she had forgotten them entirely. Still <b>clutched</b> in <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> was the revolver she had snatched from Rokoff's belt, but that could contain at most not over six cartridges--not enough to furnish her with food and protection both on the long journey to the sea.|$|R
60|$|At what {{particular}} moment the strange doubt first crept into Marguerite's mind, {{she could not}} herself have said. With the ring tightly <b>clutched</b> in <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> she {{had run out of}} the room, down the stairs, and out into the garden, where, in complete seclusion, alone with the flowers, and the river and the birds, she could look again at the ring, and study that device more closely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] she cried, <b>clutching</b> {{forward with}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and {{grasping}} his sleeve, [...] "you frighten me. You terrify me. I have never harmed you. Why should {{you wish to}} hurt an unfortunate woman? Oh, speak to me; for God's sake, speak!" ...|$|R
60|$|He began devising absurd {{plans for}} escaping. He might {{suddenly}} jump up, Pretending {{he had seen}} a burglar--Stop thief, stop thief!--and dash off into the night in pursuit. Or should he say that he felt faint, a heart attack? or that he had seen, a ghost--Emily's ghost--in the garden? Absorbed in his childish plotting, he had ceased to pay any attention to Miss Spence's words. The spasmodic <b>clutching</b> of <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> recalled his thoughts.|$|R
60|$|Then she paused, {{some five}} {{steps away from}} Déroulède, holding out towards him the {{crumpled}} paper, which up to now she had <b>clutched</b> determinedly in <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Déroulède {{was about to take}} it from her, and just before he had turned to do so, his eyes lighted on Juliette.|$|R
60|$|And it was made. They {{were married}} in the great salon, the dining- room, {{immediately}} after breakfast. Madame Bauche {{was dressed in a}} new puce silk dress, and looked very magnificent on the occasion. She simpered and smiled, and looked gay even in spite of her spectacles; and as the ceremony was being performed, she held fast <b>clutched</b> in <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> the gold watch and chain which were intended for Marie as soon as ever the marriage should be completed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw her here," [...] she said, {{pointing}} down to {{the spot}} on which she was standing; and appealing piteously to Grosse. [...] "I see her now--and I don't know where she is! She is so near, I {{feel as if she}} touched my eyes--and yet" [...] (she advanced another step, and <b>clutched</b> with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> at the empty air)--"and yet, I can't get near enough to take hold of her. Oh! what does it mean? what does it mean?" ...|$|R
60|$|Bo's scream rang in her ears; {{she felt}} the wet grass under her face and then the strong <b>hands</b> that lifted <b>her.</b> Dale loomed over her, bending down to look into her face; Bo was <b>clutching</b> <b>her</b> with frantic <b>hands.</b> And Helen could only gasp. Her breast seemed caved in. The need to breathe was torture.|$|R
6000|$|Even {{while she}} was vigorously {{representing}} to herself that he was preposterous, she was uneasily aware that Phil was masculine. His talons were strong; she could feel their <b>clutch</b> on <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> [...] "He's a rat. And I do wish he wouldn't--spit!" [...] she shuddered. But under her scorn was a surge of emotion.... A man, {{not much of a}} man, yet a man, had wanted the contact of <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> been eager to be with her. Sensations vast as night or the ocean whirled in her small, white room. Desire, and curiosity even more, made her restless as a wave.|$|R
40|$|Full-length shot of {{an actress}} {{kneeling}} {{as if in}} prayer {{in front of a}} religious painting of a woman accompanied by angels. She is <b>clutching</b> <b>her</b> left <b>hand</b> upon <b>her</b> heart, looking up at the painting. Vela (Avgusta) Nigrinova (1862, Ljubljana – 1908, Belgrade) was the daughter of a Czechoslovakian father and a Slovenian mother. She was married to Davorin Jenko, a Slovenian composer {{and the author of the}} Serbian national anthem 'Bože pravde'. Vela is considered a superb early Serbian actress. For the major part of her acting career she lived in Belgrade and played at the Royal Serbian National Theatre...|$|R
