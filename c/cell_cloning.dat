40|$|In {{contrast}} to the many reports of IL- 2 dependent proliferating, helper or killer <b>cell</b> <b>clones,</b> {{there is only a}} single report of an IL- 2 dependent suppressor <b>cell</b> <b>clone,</b> in the mouse. However by the same cloning procedures used to generate human helper <b>cells,</b> suppressor <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> to influenza virus could not be generated, and so another strategy was used. Jerne's network hypothesis proposes that immune regulation results from lymphoid cell receptors recognizing determinants on other lymphoid cell receptors. If this is the case {{it should be possible to}} generate regulatory T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> against other T cells and we report here the generation of an autologous suppressor <b>cell</b> <b>clone</b> which recognizes and inhibits the function of a human helper T <b>cell</b> <b>clone.</b> Such an autologous suppressor <b>cell</b> <b>clone</b> provides a new approach to understanding the pathways and molecular events involved in immune regulation.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that a high percentage of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) -infected lymphocytes in peripheral blood of patients with chronic, active EBV infection (CAEBV) is of T cell origin. Although T cells are expanded oligoclonally in CAEBV, {{it is not clear whether}} the restricted diversity of T cells arise from immune reaction against EBV-related antigens or from proliferation of EBV-infected cells. We experienced a patient with CAEBV who had biclonal expansion of peripheral blood T cells. We identified clonotypes of these two T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> in detail and purified the T <b>cell</b> <b>clones.</b> EBV infected mainly the two T <b>cell</b> <b>clones,</b> whereas the viral loads in peripheral blood cells other than these T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> were low or undetectable. The EBV strains infecting the two T <b>cells</b> <b>clones</b> were indistinguishable from each other by a series of genotype analyses of the virus.

40|$|BACKGROUND—T cell {{responses}} to normal intestinal bacteria or their products {{may be important}} in the immunopathogenesis of chronic enterocolitis.  AIMS—To investigate the T cell specificity and cross reactivity towards intestinal bacteria.  PATIENTS/METHODS—T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> were isolated with phytohaemagglutinin from peripheral blood and biopsy specimens of inflamed and non-inflamed colon from five patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and two controls. T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> were restimulated with anaerobic Bacteroides and Bifidobacteria species, enterobacteria, and direct isolates of aerobic intestinal flora. T cell phenotype was analysed by single-cell immunocyte assay.  RESULTS—Analysis of 96  T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> isolated from peripheral blood and biopsy specimens from two patients with IBD showed that both Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides species specifically stimulate proliferation of CD 4 +TCRαβ+ T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> from both sites and that cross reactivity exists between these anaerobic bacteria and different enterobacteria. Analysis of 210  T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> isolated from three patients with IBD and two controls showed that indigenous aerobic flora specifically stimulate T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> from peripheral blood and biopsy specimens from a foreign subject. Some of these flora specific T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> were cross reactive with defined enterobacteria. In addition, T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> stimulated by their own indigenous aerobic flora were identified in patients with IBD.  CONCLUSION—Immune {{responses to}} antigens from the intestinal microflora involve a complex network of T cell specificities.    Keywords: inflammatory bowel disease; T cells; intestinal flora; mucosal immunit...|$|R

The HLA restriction molecules for this epitope were all identified as HLA DRB 4 0101. The common essential amino acids of this epitope for these T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> were E, D, and K at positions 170, 172, and 173, respectively; other crucial amino acids for this epitope differed in each T <b>cell</b> <b>clone.</b> In addition, the alanine-substituted peptides at positions 170 and 173, but not 172, inhibited the proliferation of all T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> induced by the original peptide of human PDC~E 2 163 - 176, indicating that amino acid D at position 172 is a critical MHC~binding site for all T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> tested.

40|$|Several T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> {{have been}} derived by {{limiting}} dilution of secondary mixed leukocyte culture cells stimulated by H- 2 - and M locus (Mls) -disparate spleen cells. When examined for {{the expression of}} cytolytic activity and the ability to proliferate, these <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> can be classified into two major categories. One type of cell is noncytolytic; when cultured with irradiated spleen <b>cells,</b> such <b>clones</b> proliferate in response to Mls determinants.

The other type of cell is cytolytic; these clones do not proliferate when cultured with irradiated allogeneic spleen cells unless supernatant fluid (SF) is added. These cytolytic clones express Lyt- 2 alloantigens. Some cytolytic clones are specific for H- 2 Kd and others for H- 2 Dd alloantigens. Still other cytolytic <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> exhibit cross-reactive lysis of different H- 2 -bearing tumor and Con A blast target cells. Noncytolytic T <b>cell</b> <b>clones,</b> when stimulated by Mls antigens, were examined for their ability to promote proliferation of cytolytic T <b>cell</b> <b>clones.</b> All of the noncytolytic <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> tested were able to promote proliferation of cytolytic <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> with the concomitant expression of cytolytic activity directed toward the original stimulating alloantigen (H- 2 d). Amplification of cytolytic activity was dependent upon stimulation of the noncytolytic amplifier T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> by Mls antigens.

50|$|T cells must {{reproduce}} {{after arriving}} at the tumor site to further increase their numbers, survive the TME's hostile elements and migrate through the stroma to the cancer cells. The TME obstructs all three activities. The draining lymph nodes are the likely location for T cell clonal reproduction, although this also occurs within the tumor. Preclinical models suggest that the TME is the major site of cancer-specific T <b>cell</b> <b>cloning</b> and that the CD8+ T cell replicative response there is orchestrated by the CD103+, Baft3-dependent DC, which can efficiently cross-present cancer cell antigens, suggesting that therapeutic interventions that enhance CD103+ contribute to tumor control. Among such strategies are antibodies to the interleukin-10 receptor (IL10R). In a mammary carcinoma mouse model it neutralized the effects of TAM-produced IL10, relieved the suppression of IL12 production by intratumoral DCs and improved the CD8+ T cell-dependent antitumor effects of chemotherapy. A similar outcome was achieved by neutralizing macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1, which impaired the intratumoral accumulation of TAMs. Another strategy is the administration of antibody-interferon-β (IFN-β) complexes that activate intratumoral DCs to cross-present antigen to CD8+ T cells. They are targeted against oncogenic receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} growth of T cells {{obtained}} from localized anatomic sites of pathology may offer {{a new approach}} to the investigation of certain human autoimmune diseases. However, if interleukin- 2 -dependent T <b>cell</b> <b>cloning</b> is to be useful in helping to elucidate putative pathogenetic antigens in these diseases, the expansion of the small number of T cells obtainable from localized anatomic sites of pathology will often have to be accomplished in the absence of these, as yet undetermined, antigens. At present, it is a generally held belief that antigen-responsive, interleukin- 2 -dependent T cell lines and clones will lose antigen responsiveness if propagated in the absence of specific antigen. Thus, the use of T <b>cell</b> <b>cloning</b> might be viewed as being of limited usefulness in the investigation of certain human autoimmune diseases. In this report we demonstrate that, when propagated in the absence of antigen, human tetanus toxoid-specific, interleukin- 2 -dependent T cell lines will indeed lose antigen reactivity. However, if propagated in the absence of antigen but in the presence of antigen-presenting cells, the tetanus toxoid reactivity of a subset of such lines can be maintained. Moreover, the propagation with OKT 3 antibody, in addition to antigen-presenting cells, may be even more effective in maintaining antigen reactivity.

The T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> isolated in IL- 4 produced, in general, more IL- 4 and less IL- 2 than the clones isolated and cultured in IL- 2.

Histopathology reveals perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, demyelination, and remyelination. These studies demonstrate the utility of T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> for analyzing the association between class II major histocompatibility complex molecules and disease susceptibility...|$|R
40|$|Informed con-sent was obtained, and {{procedures}} {{approved by the}} Committee on Human Research at the University of Vermont and other POG institutions were followed. 10. Peripheral blood was separated and the mononuclear cell fraction was obtained for the T <b>cell</b> <b>cloning</b> assay within 12 to 24 hours of its collection. The T <b>cell</b> <b>cloning</b> assay and analysis have been described [see B. A. Finette et al., Mutat. Res. 308, 223 (1994) ]. 11. B. A. Finette et al., Mutat. Res. 308, 223 (1994). 12. Mutant frequencies in subjects at diagnoses, remis-sion, and relapse were compared with normal con-trols by the nonparametric KruskalÐWallis test. Pair-wise differences between groups were assessed by MannÐWhitney tests, with a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. Linear regression {{analysis was used to}} examine the relationship between the logarithm of Mf (lnMf) and months since diagnosis...|$|E

Clones were identified using the technique of schizodeme analysis. The phenomenon observed is clearly relevant to studies of parasite isolation, leishmanial metabolism, cross-immunity and chemotherapy...|$|E

Embryos also can be produced in the laboratory via techniques such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or somatic <b>cell</b> <b>cloning.</b> But the actual transfer of an embryo is only one step in a serie...|$|E
40|$|The {{adenovirus}} type 12 (Ad 12) early region 1 (E 1) gene {{was introduced}} into KB cells {{by using a}} dominant selection vector, pSV 2 -gpt, and over 80 Gpt+ KB <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> were established. Three types of recombinant DNAs (gAE 1 A, gARC, and gABA) were constructed. They contained the AccI-H, EcoRI-C, and BamHI-A fragments, respectively, of Ad 12 DNA in pSV 2 -gpt. Five of 50 (10 %) gABA-transformed <b>cell</b> <b>clones,</b> 12 of 18 (67 %) gAE 1 A-transformed <b>cell</b> <b>clones,</b> and 10 of 18 (56 %) gARC-transformed <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> complemented the growth of Ad 5 dl 312 (deletion in E 1 A) and were designated as Gpt+ Ad+ <b>cell</b> <b>clones.</b> In these <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> at their early passages, recombinant genome sequences were detected in cellular DNA and were expressed. T antigen g (the E 1 A gene product) was detected by immunofluorescence. The Gpt+ Ad+ <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> supported the growth of Ad 5 deletion mutants in parallel with the expression of Ad 12 E 1 A or E 1 A plus E 1 B genes. After infection of Gpt+ Ad+ <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> with Ad 5 dl 312, the early genes of dl 312 were efficiently transcribed, indicating {{the expression of the}} pre-early function of the Ad 12 E 1 A gene. Two clones each from gAE 1 A-,gARC-, and gABA-transformed cells were subcultured for a long period to determine the stability of the transfecting DNAs. Subculture in a nonselective medium resulted in cells which lost the transfecting DNAs. Subculture in a selective medium resulted in the selection of cells which maintained the gpt gene expression but lost the Ad 12 gene expression. These results indicate that the transfecting DNA is present in an unstable state in KB cells...|$|R
40|$|Human T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> were {{prepared}} from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} from a vaccinated human donor {{and kept in}} culture in the presence of rabies virus antigen and growth factors. Phenotypic analysis of the T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> revealed expression of the CD 3 and CD 4 cell surface markers, but not of CD 8, consistent with a phenotype of helper/inducer T cells. The rabies virus specificity of the T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> was established by virus-spccific proliferation in response to the rabies virus Pitman-Moore strain (PM) produced in three different <b>cell</b> substrates. The <b>clones</b> also responded to the rabies virus strains Evclyn-Rokitnicki-Abelseth (ERA) and challenge virus standard (CVS), but not to the rabies virus-related Mokola and Duvenhage- 6 virus strains. Proliferative responses of T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> required rabies virus antigen to be presented by autologous antigen-presenting cells in association with HLA class II molecules. When cultured with rabies virus antigen, but in the absence of growth factors, some of the T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> provided help for an antibody response of rabies virus immune B lymphocytes. Analysis of culture supernatant fluids showed that at least a part of this antibody response was directed against neutralizing antibody-inducing determinants of the viral glycoprotein...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolation}} and characterisation of T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> or lines specific to retinal antigens are valuable tools {{to clarify the}} underlying mechanisms of autoimmunity to retinal antigens as a contributing factor in ocular inflammation. Patients with Behçet's disease {{have been reported to}} be sensitised to S-antigen (S-Ag). In the present study, four T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> established from the peripheral blood of a patient with Behçet's disease were analysed. A CD 4 + T <b>cell</b> <b>clone</b> (clone 2) and a CD 8 + T <b>cell</b> <b>clone</b> (clone 10) proliferated specifically to bovine S-Ag. Although these S-Ag specific T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> proliferated vigorously to the intact antigen, their responses to S-Ag derived synthetic peptides M and G were weak, suggesting that the sites of human T cell recognition of S-Ag may be different from those established in the experimental model. The proliferative responses of both clones (2 and 10) were inhibited by anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody but not by anti-HLA-class 1 monoclonal antibody. The other two clones studied, clones 6 and 30, were CD 3 +, CD 4 -, CD 8 -, and they did not proliferate specifically to S-Ag. Clone 6 expressed gamma delta T cell receptors (TCR) and showed non-specific cytotoxic activity toward K 562 and Daudi <b>cell</b> lines. <b>Clone</b> 30 expressed alpha beta TCR, and was devoid of cytotoxic activity. Human T <b>cell</b> lines and <b>clones</b> specific to retinal antigens will provide the framework necessary to examine the events that lead to ocular inflammation...|$|R
