50|$|FN Herstal was {{the first}} small arms {{manufacturer}} to respond to NATOs requirement; FN started by developing a shoulder-fired personal defense weapon, the FN P90, along with a small caliber, high velocity 5.7×28mm <b>cartridge</b> <b>type.</b> The original 5.7×28mm cartridge, called the SS90, went into production with the P90 in 1990. This <b>cartridge</b> <b>type</b> was discontinued in 1993, and replaced with the 5.7×28mm SS190, which used a heavier and slightly shorter projectile weighing 2.0 g (31 grains). The reduced length of the SS190 projectile allowed it to be used more conveniently in the Five-seven, which was under development at that time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:Two {{types of}} factory marked Sintox® {{ammunition}} were investigated from {{the composition of}} gunshot residue particles (GSR) and occurrence of marking substance points of view. The experiments were carried out with two cartridges of caliber 9 mm Luger (9 × 19 Parabellum) of two producers (Ruag Ammotec, Switzerland and Men, Germany). The first <b>cartridge</b> (<b>type</b> Action 4, Ruag Ammotec) contains gadolinium as a marking element, while the other <b>cartridge</b> (<b>type</b> PEP II, Men) is marked with gallium in gunpowder. Scanning electron microscopy equipped with EDAX analyzer (SEM/EDX) was used to detect and analyze the GSR particles in samples collected from the cartridges, barrels and shooter’s hands. Besides those, particles from the hit clothes placed at different shooting distances were collected and analyzed. The spreading of GSR cloud from the gun was observed using the high-speed camera. Results obtained clearly revealed that the way of ammunition production/construction and type of marking of ammunition can significantly influence the presence and detection reliability of marking elements in GSR. The detectability is affected also by the shooting distance...|$|R

30|$|Materials such as wax, occlusal {{registration}} paper, and {{pressure-sensitive paper}} {{are used to}} examine occlusal contact. The present study utilized an examination method using silicone [11, 12, 16]. The Blue Silicone {{used in the present}} study is a <b>cartridge</b> <b>type,</b> which allows a nearly constant mixing ratio to be maintained, it has low viscosity and thus flows well, and it shows little dimensional change over time.

50|$|The Five-seven pistol was {{developed}} {{in conjunction with the}} FN P90 personal defense weapon and the FN 5.7×28mm cartridge. The P90 was introduced in 1990, and the Five-seven was introduced in 1998 as a pistol using the same 5.7×28mm ammunition. Developed as a companion pistol to the P90, the Five-seven shares many of its design features: it is a lightweight polymer-based weapon with a large magazine capacity, ambidextrous controls, low recoil, and the ability to penetrate body armor when using certain <b>cartridge</b> <b>types.</b>|$|R

To accommodate the turbodiesel's extra power, these models featured a larger clutch (270 versus 240 mm) and larger oil cooler (five rows versus three) than the {{naturally aspirated}} version.|$|R

40|$|A new {{technique}} for the deposition of standard solutions on particulate aerosol samples using pico-droplets for elemental determinations with total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (TXRF) is described. It enables short analysis times without influencing the sample structure and avoids time consuming scanning {{of the sample}} with the exciting beam in SR-TXRF analysis. Droplets of picoliter volume (not, vert, similar 5 – 130 pL) were generated with commercially available and slightly modified inkjet printers operated with popular image processing software. The size of the dried droplets on surfaces of different polarity namely silicone coated and untreated quartz reflectors, was determined for five different printer types and ten different <b>cartridge</b> <b>types.</b> The results show that droplets generated by inkjet printers are between 50 and 200 μm in diameter (corresponding to volumes of 5 to 130 pL) depending on the <b>cartridge</b> <b>type,</b> which is smaller than {{the width of the}} synchrotron beam used in the experiments (< 1 mm at an energy of 17 keV at the beamline L at HASYLAB, Hamburg). The precision of the printing of a certain amount of a single element standard solution was found to be comparable to aliquoting with micropipettes in TXRF, where for 2. 5 ng of cobalt relative standard deviations of 12 % are found. However, it could be shown that the printing of simple patterns is possible, which is important when structured samples have to be analysed...|$|R
50|$|As African hunting safaris {{became more}} popular from the 1990s onward {{there has been}} a renewed {{interest}} in the cartridge.
