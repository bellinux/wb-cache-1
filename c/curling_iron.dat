While responding negatively to {{a majority of}} Speak, John Murphy of MusicOMH cited [...] "Over" [...] as being [...] "actually rather good" [...] and noted similarities between the song and the works of Michelle Branch. Nicholas Fonseca from Entertainment Weekly considered the track a [...] "tween-slumber-party-friendly" [...] which [...] "is perfect for singing into your <b>curling</b> <b>iron</b> {{in front of the}} mirror". Sputnikmusic called [...] "Over" [...] "awesomely catchy", and complimented its guitar tone.|$|E
500|$|Vala started {{wearing the}} normal SG team uniform in [...] "Origin", the third episode of season 9. Claudia Black was later {{included}} in the design process and was given full control over her wardrobe for scenes that required civilian clothes. As such, Black chose Vala's underwear for the seduction scene in [...] "The Ties That Bind" [...] and her shopping tour outfit in [...] "Family Ties". The latter episode also showed Vala with seven distinctly different hairstyles and outfits in total. Fearing the lack of seriousness, the producers opposed the make-up department's decision of having Vala wear curlers, but the scene could not be reshot. Similarly, a scene showing Vala unpacking her hair dryer and <b>curling</b> <b>iron</b> during an offworld mission in [...] "The Quest" [...] was deemed too silly and was trimmed to the basics; {{it would have been}} cut if the footage had allowed it. Due to Black's pregnancy during the filming of the films, the costume department needed to hide Black's bump with appropriate dressing.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Curling</b> <b>irons,</b> {{also known}} as curling tongs, create waves or curls in hair {{using a variety of}} {{different}} methods. There are many different types of modern <b>curling</b> <b>irons,</b> which can vary by diameter, material, and shape of barrel and the type of handle. The barrel's diameter can be anywhere from [...]5 in to 2 in. Smaller barrels typically create spiral curls or ringlets, and larger barrels are used to give shape and volume to a hairstyle.|$|R

50|$|A hairbrush is a stick {{brush with}} rigid or soft {{bristles}} used in hair care for smoothing, styling, and detangling human hair, or for grooming an animal's fur. It {{can also be}} used for styling with a <b>curling</b> <b>iron</b> or blowdryer.|$|E

50|$|A hair iron or hair tong {{is a tool}} used {{to change}} the {{structure}} of the hair using heat. There are three general kinds: <b>curling</b> <b>irons,</b> used to make the hair curly, straightening irons, commonly called straighteners or flat irons, used to straighten the hair, and crimping irons, used to create crimps of the desired size in the hair.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence.

50|$|This {{style is}} usually {{achieved}} {{by the use of}} moustache wax, although hair gel, a <b>curling</b> <b>iron,</b> or natural curling can suffice. Generally, the greater the curl of the extremities, the more dramatic the appearance achieved. When worn without wax or grooming, the moustache style may more closely resemble a walrus moustache.|$|E
50|$|The <b>curling</b> <b>iron</b> {{can also}} have either a spring-loaded, Marcel, or {{clipless}} handle. Spring-loaded handles {{are the most popular}} and use a spring to work the barrel's clamp. When using a Marcel handle, one applies his or her own pressure to the clamp. Clipless wands have no clamp, and the user simply wraps hair around a rod. Most clipless curling irons come with a Kevlar glove to avoid burns.|$|E
5000|$|A ringlet {{is a type}} of hairstyle. Ringlets {{are often}} also known as tube curls or {{corkscrew}} curls. It is achieved by wrapping a lock of hair around the length of a thin <b>curling</b> <b>iron</b> or can be sported naturally by people with sufficiently tightly curled hair. The curls can also be achieved by hair rollers. Loose ringlets can be created just by twisting wet hair as well.|$|E
50|$|Synthetic wigs {{are usually}} {{made from a}} fine fiber that mimics human hair. This fiber {{can be made in}} almost any color and hairstyle, and is often glossier than human hair.

50|$|In ancient civilizations, women's {{hair was}} often elaborately and {{carefully}} dressed in special ways.

50|$|Parisian Francois Marcel Grateau {{is said to}} have {{revolutionized}} hair styling when {{he invented}} and introduced heated irons to curl and wave his customers' hair in France in 1872. His Marcel Wave remained fashionable for many decades. Britain's Science and Society Library credits L. Pelleray of Paris with manufacturing the heated irons in the 1870s. An example of an 1890s version of Pelleray's <b>curling</b> <b>iron</b> is housed at the Chudnow Museum in Milwaukee.|$|E
50|$|The calamistrum was {{the name}} for the Roman <b>curling</b> <b>iron.</b> It {{consisted}} of a hollow metal outer cylinder and a smaller solid cylinder inside it. The hair would be wrapped around the solid cylinder and inserted into the metal outer. The metal outer would be heated in a fire, making the hair curly. It {{has been reported that}} because of the frequency and temperature that hair was curled at, thinning and damaged hair was common amongst women.|$|E

5000|$|Mary Babnik Brown (November 22, 1907 - April 14, 1991) was an American {{who became}} known for having donated her hair to the United States {{military}} during World War II.

50|$|Mesopotamian men of Semitic origin (Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians and Chaldeans) devoted {{great care}} to oiling and {{dressing}} their beards, using tongs and <b>curling</b> <b>irons</b> to create elaborate ringlets and tiered patterns. Unlike them, the non-Semitic Sumerian men tended to shave off their facial hair (which is especially notable, for example, in the numerous statues of Gudea, a ruler of Lagash, {{as opposed to}} the depiction of the roughly contemporaneous Semitic ruler of Akkad, Naram-Sin, on his victory stele).|$|R
