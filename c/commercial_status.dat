2500|$|Austrian {{authorities}} associated enlightened Jews as such {{with the}} free city of Brody. The governor of Galicia aptly noted that in Galicia there are Orthodox, Hasidim and Karaites, but enlightened Jews can be found only in Brody. Brody was the second largest city (after Lemberg) in East Galicia with the largest proportion of the Jewish population among perhaps of all the district cities in Europe ever (88%). Brody stands out as Jewish cultural and economic center in the area, a [...] "symbol". Brody was tax free city during early Austrian rule, that fact which promoted its <b>commercial</b> <b>status</b> to the central commercial hub of Eastern Galicia (linking it with the major European trade centers such as Leipzig).

There were not many cities Europe with nearly exclusively Jewish population, except Brody, and {{to a certain degree}} Berdychiv in Russian Ukraine and Thessaloniki in Greece. In 1827, out of total number 11,718 Jewish merchants and shopkeepers in the whole of Galicia, 1,134 (about 10%) were in Brody. The same year, Brody was home to 36 Jewish brokers and 9 Jewish bankers.
