Obama attended the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which drafted the non-binding <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Accord</b> as a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. The deal provided for the monitoring of carbon emissions among developing countries, but it did not include Obama's proposal to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2050. In 2014, Obama reached an agreement with China in which China pledged to reach peak carbon emission levels by 2030, while the US pledged to cut its emissions by 26-28 percent compared to its 2005 levels. The deal provided momentum for a potential multilateral global warming agreement among the world's largest carbon emitters. Many Republicans criticized Obama's climate goals as a potential drain on the economy. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, nearly {{every country in the world}} agreed to a landmark climate deal in which each nation committed lowering their greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement created a universal accounting system for emissions, required each country to monitor its emissions, and required each country to create a plan to reduce its emissions. Several climate negotiators noted that the US-China climate deal and the EPA's emission limits helped make the deal possible. In 2016, the international community agreed to the Kigali accord, an amendment to the Montreal Protocol which sought to reduce the use of HFCs, organic compounds that contribute to global warming.|$|E

[...] Martin Khor blamed Denmark for convening a meeting of only 26 nations in the final two days of the conference. He says that it undermined the UN's multilateral and democratic process of climate negotiations. It was in these meetings that China vetoed long-term emission-reduction goals for global emissions to decrease by 50%, and developed countries emissions to fall by 80% by 2050 compared to 1990. Khor states that this is when other countries began to blame the failures on China. If China had accepted this, by 2050 their emissions per capita would have had to be around one half to one fifth per capita of those of the United States.|$|E

The current emissions trajectory would rapidly and significantly alter many ecosystems and the associated services on which humans heavily depend. A reduced emissions scenario—consistent with the <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Accord’s</b> goal of a global temperature increase of less than 2 °C—is much more favorable to the ocean but still substantially alters important marine ecosystems and associated goods and services.

40|$|Abstract: More {{than two}} decades of climate change {{negotiations}} have produced a series of global climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Accords,</b> but have nevertheless made very limited progress in curbing global emissions of greenhouse gases. This paper considers whether negotiations can succeed in reaching an agreement that effectively addresses the climate change problem. To be effective, a climate agreement must cause substantial emissions reductions either directly (in the agreement's own lifetime) or indirectly (by {{paving the way for}} a future agreement that causes substantial emissions reductions directly). To reduce global emissions substantially, an agreement must satisfy three conditions. Firstly, participation must be both comprehensive and stable. Secondly, participating countries must accept deep commitments. Finally, the agreement must obtain high compliance rates. We argue that three types of enforcement will be crucial to fulfilling these three conditions: (1) incentives for countries to ratify with deep commitments, (2) incentives for countries that have ratified with deep commitments to abstain from withdrawal, and (3) incentives for countries having ratified with deep commitments to comply with them. Based on assessing the constraints that characterize the climate change negotiations, we contend that adopting such three-fold poten...|$|R
40|$|The Copenhagen {{interpretation}} is {{an interpretation of}} quantum mechanics formulated mainly by Niels Bohr and also Werner Heisenberg while collaborating in <b>Copenhagen.</b> <b>According</b> to a poll in 1997, the Copenhagen {{interpretation is}} the most widely-accepted interpretation of quantum mechanics [1] {{and it was the}} first general attempt to understand the world of atoms. Since Copenhagen Interpretation was developed by a number of scientists and philosophers in different times there is not very clear statement of the Copenhagen Interpretation. In fact Bohr and Heisenberg never completely agreed on the details of the interpretation of quantum mechanic, and none of them ever used the term “the Copenhagen interpretation ” as a joint name for their ideas [2]. However it is possible to summarize some of the main principles of this interpretation based mainly on Bohr’s statements. Nowadays, the Copenhagen interpretation is mainly famous for indeterminism, Bohr's correspondence principle as well as his complementarity interpretation and Born's probability rule [2]. It is useful to mention a statement by E. T. Jaynes about the role of Bohr in quantum mechanic [3]: “Our present quantum mechanical formalism is a peculiar mixture describing in par...|$|R
