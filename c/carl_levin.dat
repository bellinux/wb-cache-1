Their woes were heard in a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing which was chaired by Senator Levin, who said that he intends to keep the spotlight on credit card companies and that legislative action may be necessary to purge the industry.

25|$|On July 22, 2014, Simons {{was subject}} to {{bipartisan}} condemnation by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations {{for the use of}} complex barrier options to shield day-to-day trading (usually subject to higher ordinary income tax rates) as long-term capital gains. “Renaissance Technologies was able to avoid paying more than $6 billion in taxes by disguising its day-to-day stock trades as long term investments,” said Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), the committee’s ranking Republican, in his opening statement. “Two banks and a handful of hedge funds developed a complex financial structure to engage in highly profitable trades while claiming an unjustified lower tax rate and avoiding limits on trading with borrowed money,” said Sen. <b>Carl</b> <b>Levin</b> (D., Mich.) in his prepared remarks.|$|E
500|$|This {{subcommittee}} {{would be}} the scene of some of McCarthy's most publicized exploits.

500|$|The Michigan State Highway Commission {{canceled}} the northern {{section of the}} highway, originally planned to continue northward from Novi to a point near Davisburg and Clarkston, on January 26, 1977, after it spent $1.6 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) the year before purchasing land for the roadway. This northern section was not planned as an Interstate Highway at that time, bearing the designation M-275 instead. Opposition to construction came from various citizens' groups and different levels of local government. Additionally, both The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press opposed the project. The Detroit City Council, led by then-Chairman <b>Carl</b> <b>Levin,</b> opposed the plan. Levin said at the time, [...] "At last I think people are {{waking up to the}} dangers of more and more expressways. At some point we've got to say enough. And I think we've reached it." [...] The US Department of the Interior reviewed the state's environmental impact study of the project and stated that the project, [...] "will cause irreparable damages on recreation lands, wetlands, surface waters and wildlife habitat."

500|$|While {{control of}} the House of Representatives {{went over to the}} Republicans in the 112th Congress, the Senate stayed Democratic and McCain {{continued}} to be the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. As the Arab Spring took center stage, McCain urged that the embattled Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, step down and thought the U.S. should push for democratic reforms in the region despite the associated risks of religious extremists gaining power. McCain was an especially vocal supporter of the 2011 military intervention in Libya. In April of that year he visited the Anti-Gaddafi forces and National Transitional Council in Benghazi, the highest-ranking American to do so, and said that the rebel forces were [...] "my heroes". In June, he joined with Senator Kerry in offering a resolution that would have authorized the military intervention, and said: [...] "The administration's disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive." [...] In August, McCain voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011 that resolved the U.S. debt ceiling crisis. In November, McCain and Senator <b>Carl</b> <b>Levin</b> were leaders in efforts to codify in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 that terrorism suspects, no matter where captured, could be detained by the U.S. military and its tribunal system; following objections by civil libertarians, some Democrats, and the White House, McCain and Levin agreed to language making it clear that the bill would not pertain to U.S. citizens.|$|E

Other freeway projects cancelled during the 1970s included an extension of the US131 freeway northward to Petoskey, an extension of the US23 freeway from Standish to Alpena, and a freeway running across the southern Lower Peninsula toward Chicago. These ventures, along with the I-275 extension, were dropped over concerns related to rising construction costs, the environment and the Arab Oil Embargo. Even with these cancelled highways, several proposals were left to be completed.|$|E

2500|$|Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer of California {{drafted a}} similar {{amendment}} on September 20. The text condemned the Petraeus ad {{as well as}} a 2002 ad attacking then-Senator Max Cleland of Georgia during the 2002 midterm elections and the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth ads attacking John Kerry during the 2004 Presidential election. Democratic Senator <b>Carl</b> <b>Levin</b> of Michigan said, [...] "They're all disgraceful ads and we ought to treat them the same way".
