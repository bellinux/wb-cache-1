50|$|Most {{prevalent}} work {{principle for}} CSH is <b>Bell</b> <b>Crank</b> Mechanism. The <b>Bell</b> <b>crank</b> lever rotates around the Fulcrum point. One {{end of the}} <b>Bell</b> <b>crank</b> lever {{is connected to the}} pipe ‘P’, the other end is connected to the spring by the tie rod. Thus when the pipe moves down from cold to hot condition, the point P moves down, and as it moves down the <b>Bell</b> <b>crank</b> lever will rotate in the anti clock wise direction & tie rod connected to the spring will be pulled in, by which the spring gets further compressed. When the pipe moves up the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> lever will rotate (in the clock wise direction) & the tie rod connected to spring will be pushed out thus allowing the spring to expand or relax.|$|R
50|$|The {{short drive}} shaft {{operated}} a screw sleeve, which extended {{to work a}} <b>bell</b> <b>crank.</b> The <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> turned a transverse shaft fitted with an eccentric cam, which would push or pull the pivot clamp, thus moving the rocket forward or aftward along its centreline.|$|R
25|$|On Novelty, the {{cylinders}} were mounted vertically towards {{the rear of}} the engine (to the right {{of the men in the}} illustration). Directly below were <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> which changed the drive to horizontal. Connecting rods linked the <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> to the crank axle (the axle on the left in the illustration).|$|R

40|$|An Automatic jack can {{be easily}} {{operated}} by using of pneumatic cylinder which is operated by compressed air cylinder. The jack assembly will be mounted on both the sides of chassis according to the weight distributions of the car. Similarly it will be installed {{on the other side}} of the car. The system operates on pneumatic drive which consists of following main parts: Pneumatic cylinder, compressed air cylinder, <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> liver to lift the vehicle. The <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> liver actuate separately for either side of car as per the condition. The car gets lifted and load gets distributed on pivot of <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> liver they guide by c-sec case. The cylinder pushes the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> liver under guide of c-section. This jack will be very useful for all the senior citizens and especially for females (ladies) who find it extremely difficult to operate the jack manually in any breakdown condition. As the hydraulic oil is incompressible so the lifting capacity is more in comparison with the pneumatic system which operates on air which is compressible...|$|R
50|$|L&MR No.32 Experiment {{was built}} in 1833 with {{vertical}} cylinders mounted just behind the chimney, driving the wheels via a <b>bell</b> <b>crank.</b> The locomotive also had piston valves. These valves were probably {{the reason that the}} design was not a success, rather than the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> transmission, which was used successfully in other locomotives. Another reason that the locomotive was not successful was steam leakage from the cylinders. Experiment was withdrawn after a few months.|$|R

50|$|Speeds {{increased}} due to {{more powerful}} engines, {{and the quality}} of ride had to be improved. In the 1930s, the Christie suspension was developed, which allowed the use of coil springs inside a vehicle's armored hull, by changing the direction of force deforming the spring, using a <b>bell</b> <b>crank.</b> The T-34's suspension was directly descended from Christie designs. Horstmann suspension was a variation which used a combination of <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> and exterior coil springs, in use from the 1930s to the 1990s. The bogie, but nonetheless independent, suspension of the M3 Lee/Grant and the M4 Sherman was similar to the Hortsmann type, with the suspension contained within the track oval.|$|R

30|$|The <b>Bell</b> <b>Crank</b> {{system is}} the one {{with a pair of}} wheels on a <b>bell</b> <b>crank,</b> each bogie {{connected}} by a short arm and lever to a central spring running the tank length [9]. This system had too much interconnection but decent travel length and tended to make the tank sway back and forth a lot in motion. The single and double Torsion Bar system is a common modern-type tank suspension and can be found today on many fast track layers. The original structure and concept appeared on the German tiger tanks [10]. A steel bar runs under the bottom of the tank and twists with a short trailing arm connected to it and carrying a wheel. As the wheels hit bumps, the bar twists to absorb the impact. This system is compact, light, simple to manufacture and can provide decent travel length.|$|R
50|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the Type 95 tank was its simple suspension system. Two bogie wheels were suspended on a single <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> with two <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> per side. The tracks were driven through the front sprockets. There were two return wheels. The suspension had troubles early on, with a tendency to pitch so badly on rough ground that the crew sometimes {{found it impossible to}} drive at any speed, and so it was modified with a brace to connect the pairs of bogies. Despite this, the tank continued to give its users a rough ride across any uneven ground. It was provided with an interior layer of asbestos padding separated from the hull with an air gap, to isolate the crew from the sun-heated armor plates, and to protect the crew from injury when the tank moved across rough terrain.|$|R

50|$|By 1932, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was {{producing}} an air-cooled diesel engine that was suitable for tanks. It was placed experimentally into a Type 89. This later {{became known as}} the Type 89-B medium tank. Subsequently, Major Tomio Hara designed the basis of many of the suspensions of future Japanese tanks, the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> scissors which had paired bogie wheels connected by a coil spring mounted horizontally outside the hull.|$|R
50|$|Primary {{flight control}} is {{achieved}} by use of dual control wheels and rudder pedals. The control wheels operate the elevator and ailerons mechanically through a system of cables, pulleys, push-pull tubes and <b>bell</b> <b>cranks.</b> Trim functions, microphone keying, autopilot override and steering system switches {{are located in the}} control wheels. The rudder pedals mechanically operate the rudder for directional yaw control. Nose wheel steering is electrically controlled via the rudder pedals.|$|R

50|$|The Type 87 Chi-I had {{a complex}} {{parallelogram}} suspension system with {{two pairs of}} road bogie wheels per leaf spring arrangement.

This car utilized the same engine, differential, and rear chassis subframe configurations as the 1998 and 1999 cars. However, a new rear upright and half shaft designs were implemented to eliminate cv joint failure and to reduce overall weight.
