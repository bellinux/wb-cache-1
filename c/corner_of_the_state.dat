5|$|The {{infusions of}} {{tropical}} moisture from Arizona-bound tropical cyclones {{can be a}} significant portion of the rainfall in the region. In years when hurricanes approach Arizona, eastern and northern portions of the state receive on average 6–8% of the monsoon-season precipitation from tropical systems and their remnants. This percentage rises towards the southwestern <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> which can receive up to a quarter of its monsoon-season rainfall from tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{built the}} Willow Run Expressway to carry workers from Detroit {{to the defense}} plants at Willow Run Airport. This {{expressway}} was numbered {{as a part of}} US112 initially. During the 1950s, additional highways were converted to freeways before the coming of the Interstate Highway System in 1957. The first highway renumbered as an Interstate was US24A in the southeastern <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> which became part of Interstate 75 (I-75) in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Dating back to {{the early}} days of the state highway system, M-50 was first signed in the southeastern <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> in 1919. During the 1920s, the highway was {{extended}} to the Grand Rapids area and beyond to Lake Michigan, making it a trans-peninsular route connecting that Great Lake with Lake Erie. A rerouting of highways including M-50 through Grand Rapids in the 1950s created Business M-50 (Bus. M-50), a business loop through that city that lasted for eight years. Additional changes made during the 1960s rerouted M-50 to replace its business loop until the highway was shortened to its present western terminus south of Lowell. A pair of truncations in Monroe in 1996 and 2006 are responsible for the present-day eastern terminus.|$|E

5|$|Jacob Loucks Devers {{was born}} on 8 September 1887, in York, Pennsylvania, a small {{industrial}} town in the southeastern <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> His parents were Philip Devers, a watchmaker and partner in a jewelry store, and Ella Kate Loucks Devers, a homemaker.

The Devers, of Irish and German-Alsatian ancestry, were strict, hardworking and religious. The family belonged to the Evangelical Lutheran Church, which did not believe in smoking or drinking. While providing a comfortable middle-class life for their children, the couple taught them to value dependability, integrity and industriousness.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota {{is a state}} {{located in}} the north-central United States. It is usually {{considered}} {{to be in the}} Midwestern region of the country. The state can generally be divided into three geographic regions: eastern South Dakota, western South Dakota, and the Black Hills. Eastern South Dakota is lower in elevation and higher in precipitation than {{the western part of the}} state, and the Black Hills are a low, isolated mountain group in the southwestern <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> Smaller sub-regions in the state include the Coteau des Prairies, Coteau du Missouri, James River Valley, the Dissected Till Plains, and the Badlands. Geologic formations in South Dakota range in age from two billion-year-old Precambrian granite in the Black Hills to glacial till deposited over the last few million years. South Dakota is the 17th-largest state in the country.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1929, MSHD started {{updating}} the route that US23 followed through the Lower Peninsula. Late that year, the routing {{was moved to}} {{the east side of the}} Saginaw River, and M-47 was extended along the former course on the west side of the river. During 1930, a set of changes realigned the highway's route through the southeast <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> Near Ida, US23 was rerouted along M-50 to Dundee and north through Milan to Ann Arbor, bypassing Maybee and Whittaker. US23 was moved from its inland routing between Omer and Tawas City via Whittemore to follow a shoreline alignment by way of Au Gres along Saginaw Bay around 1932; the former route through Twining and Whittemore became an extension of M-65 and the section from Whittemore east to Tawas City was added to M-55 as a part of these changes.|$|E

5|$|Uttar Pradesh has a humid {{subtropical}} climate and experiences four seasons.

Summers are extreme with temperatures fluctuating anywhere between 0°C and 50°C {{in parts of the}} state. The Gangetic plain varies from semiarid to sub-humid. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 650mm in the southwest <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> to 1000mm in the eastern and southeastern parts of the state. Primarily a summer phenomenon, the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian monsoon is the major bearer of rain in most parts of state. It is the south-west monsoon which brings most of the rain here, although rain due to the western disturbances and north-east monsoon also contribute small quantities towards the overall precipitation of the state.|$|E
5|$|Sioux Falls is {{the largest}} city in South Dakota, with an {{estimated}} 2007 population of 151,505, and a metropolitan area population of 227,171. The city {{is located in the}} southeast <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> and was founded in 1856. The economy of Sioux Falls, originally focused on agri-business and quarrying, has recently become largely centered on retail and financial services. Rapid City, with a 2007 estimated population of 63,997, and a metropolitan area population of 120,279, is the second-largest city in the state. It is located on {{the eastern edge of the}} Black Hills in western South Dakota, and was founded in 1876. Rapid City's economy is largely based on tourism and defense spending, due to the close proximity of tourist attractions in the Black Hills and Ellsworth Air Force Base. The next eight largest cities in the state, in order of descending 2007 population, are Aberdeen (24,410), Watertown (20,530), Brookings (19,463), Mitchell (14,832), Pierre (14,032), Yankton (13,643), Huron (10,902), and Vermillion (10,251). Pierre is the state capital, and Brookings and Vermillion are the locations of the state's two largest universities. Of the ten largest cities in the state, Rapid City is the only one located west of the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|On 20 November 1992, a {{major fire}} {{occurred}} at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread {{damage to the}} Upper Ward. The Private Chapel in the north-east <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Apartments was being renovated {{as part of a}} long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms, and severely damaged more than 100 others. Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection. The fire spread through the roof voids and efforts continued through the night to contain the blaze, at great risk to the 200 fire-fighters involved. It was not until late afternoon that the blaze began to come under control, although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning. Along with the fire and smoke damage, one of the unintended effects of the fire-fighting was the considerable water damage to the castle; more than 1.5 million gallons of water were used to extinguish it, which in many ways caused more complex restoration problems than the fire.|$|E

Stomach contents of two otters were mostly crayfish; newts and fish also were present...|$|R
