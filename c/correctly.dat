5|$|Watson took a {{commanding}} lead in Double Jeopardy!, <b>correctly</b> responding to both Daily Doubles. Watson {{responded to the}} second Daily Double <b>correctly</b> with a 32% confidence score.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the idea}} is simple, {{implementing}} binary search <b>correctly</b> requires attention to some subtleties about its exit conditions and midpoint calculation.|$|E
5|$|Each {{contestant}} had {{the same}} decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt {{to answer the question}} or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered <b>correctly,</b> the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered <b>correctly,</b> that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and <b>correctly</b> answered their question {{at the end of the}} tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.|$|E
5|$|If {{the images}} on the Tullstorp Runestone are <b>correctly</b> {{identified}} as depicting Ragnarök, then Fenrir is shown above the ship Naglfar.|$|E
5|$|In {{the cold}} open, Kevin struggles to <b>correctly</b> {{transfer}} phone calls, {{after having been}} moved to reception by Charles.|$|E
5|$|Intuitively, the {{algorithm}} follows all chains of inference after making {{each of its}} choices. This either leads to a contradiction and a backtracking step, or, if no contradiction is derived, {{it follows that the}} choice was a correct one that leads to a satisfying assignment. Therefore, {{the algorithm}} either <b>correctly</b> finds a satisfying assignment or it <b>correctly</b> determines that the input is unsatisfiable.|$|E
5|$|King safety: It is {{critical}} to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities. A <b>correctly</b> timed castling can often enhance this.|$|E
5|$|On the {{syndicated}} version's first season, two contestants <b>correctly</b> answered all 15 questions {{and won the}} top prize of $1,000,000: Kevin Smith on February 18, 2003, and Nancy Christy on May 8 of the same year. During the Million Dollar Tournament of Ten which aired in November 2009, Sam Murray, who had previously supplied correct responses for eleven questions, risked his winnings on a special $1,000,000 question; {{he was the only}} contestant to answer his question <b>correctly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Patients visit {{an average}} of five {{physicians}} over 2.75 years before being <b>correctly</b> diagnosed with rumination syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Some {{national}} standards {{require that the}} cylinder valve includes a bursting disk, a pressure relief device that will release the gas before the cylinder fails {{in the event of}} overpressurization. If a bursting disk ruptures during a dive the entire contents of the cylinder will be lost in a very short time. The risk of this happening to a <b>correctly</b> rated disc, in good condition, on a <b>correctly</b> filled cylinder is very low.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Parachute Brigade (Brigadier James Hill) {{began to}} land {{at the same time}} as the main {{elements}} of 5th Parachute Brigade, and suffered from the same problems. All of its constituent units were scattered throughout the area due to poor navigation, heavy cloud cover, and several of the drop-zones either not being marked <b>correctly</b> or marked <b>correctly</b> but incorrectly positioned due to pathfinder error.|$|E
5|$|The {{half-life}} of the 240Cm α-decay was <b>correctly</b> determined as 26.7 days.|$|E
5|$|Though {{cats and}} dogs are often {{characterized}} as natural enemies, they can live together if <b>correctly</b> socialized.|$|E
5|$|Thus, to <b>correctly</b> {{simplify the}} first {{statement}} in SQL {{requires that we}} return all rows in which x is not null.|$|E
5|$|A {{theodolite}} can {{be considerably}} more accurate if used <b>correctly,</b> {{but it is}} also considerably more difficult to use <b>correctly.</b> There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be calibrated using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun. Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a clinometer.|$|E
5|$|Before {{radioactive}} sources can {{be delivered}} to the tumour site, the applicators have to be inserted and <b>correctly</b> positioned {{in line with the}} initial planning.|$|E
5|$|Cytotoxic drugs {{inhibit the}} immune {{response}} by killing dividing cells such as activated T cells. However, the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected, which causes toxic side effects. Immunosuppressive {{drugs such as}} cyclosporin prevent T cells from responding to signals <b>correctly</b> by inhibiting signal transduction pathways.|$|E
5|$|Disturbances {{of human}} pigmentation, either loss or reduction, {{may be related}} to loss of melanocytes or the {{inability}} of melanocytes to produce melanin or transport melanosomes <b>correctly.</b>|$|E
5|$|During formal occasions, {{four people}} are {{required}} to properly fold the flag, where each person holds one of the sides. A <b>correctly</b> folded flag must be a square limiting the national shield. However, the order by which the different folding steps are performed to achieve this result is not legislated.|$|E
5|$|Glyphs are {{inscribed in}} a {{vertical}} orientation, {{even if the}} object depicted (e.g. fish, Orion’s belt) is usually seen horizontally. This serves the purposes of economy and aesthetic effect. The 'vertical rule' is important for interpreting the glyphs <b>correctly,</b> so it may have assisted in secrecy as well.|$|E
5|$|Homing pigeons use {{magnetic}} field information with other navigational cues. Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing pigeons could not orient themselves <b>correctly</b> {{on a clear}} sunny day, but could do so on an overcast day, suggesting that the birds prefer {{to rely on the}} direction of the sun, but switch to using a {{magnetic field}} cue when the sun is not visible. This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the pigeons could not orient <b>correctly</b> on an overcast day when the magnetic field was disrupted.|$|E
5|$|However, even if UTC is used internally, {{the systems}} still require {{external}} leap second updates and time zone information to <b>correctly</b> calculate local time as needed. Many systems {{in use today}} base their date/time calculations from data derived from the IANA time zone database also known as zoneinfo.|$|E
5|$|If {{the rider}} on horseback {{on the image}} on the Böksta Runestone has been <b>correctly</b> {{identified}} as Odin, then Geri and Freki are shown taking part in hunting an elk or moose.|$|E
5|$|Illegality {{is one of}} {{the three}} broad {{headings}} of judicial review of administrative action in Singapore, the others being irrationality and procedural impropriety. To avoid acting illegally, an administrative body or public authority must <b>correctly</b> understand the law regulating its power to act and to make decisions, and give effect to it.|$|E
5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question <b>correctly.</b> If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered <b>correctly</b> and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} build their vocabularies, infants must learn about the {{meanings}} that words carry. The mapping problem asks how infants <b>correctly</b> learn to attach words to referents. Constraints theories, domain-general views, social-pragmatic accounts, and an emergentist coalition model have been proposed {{to account for the}} mapping problem...|$|E
5|$|In this bonus round, {{each member}} of the winning team plays the same {{question}} individually. While the first contestant is asked the question, the second is isolated offstage so that they cannot see or hear the question. The two teammates have a total of 40 seconds to answer (in seasons 1 and 2, the time limit was 30 seconds); the clock stops when the first contestant submits an answer, and resumes when the second contestant first sees the question. If one team member answers the question <b>correctly,</b> they receive an additional $1,000; if both answer <b>correctly,</b> their winnings are augmented to $10,000.|$|E
5|$|Judicial {{independence}} is essential. It would be futile {{for people to}} approach the courts for adjudication of their disputes if the courts do not apply the law independently. Moreover, people can only be guided by the law if judges apply it <b>correctly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Matejko based the {{painting}} in part on {{a description of the}} battle in Długosz' chronicles, which accounts for several historical inaccuracies. At the same time, he was meticulous about <b>correctly</b> depicting the terrain of the battle, having visited the site of the conflict in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Natural justice must be adhered to. For {{the law to}} {{be applied}} <b>correctly,</b> {{requirements}} such as an open and fair hearing and an absence of bias are essential.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of July 2, Meade <b>correctly</b> {{predicted}} at a council of war that Lee would attack {{the center of his}} lines the following morning.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{stressed}} serpin fold is high-energy, mutations {{can cause}} them to incorrectly change into their lower-energy conformations (e.g. relaxed or latent) before they have <b>correctly</b> performed their inhibitory role.|$|E
5|$|The 1989 International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC) {{included}} an entry by Brian Westley. Westley's computer {{program can be}} encoded in ROT13 or reversed and still compiles <b>correctly.</b> Its operation, when executed, is either to perform ROT13 encoding on, or to reverse its input.|$|E
5|$|The PIATs' {{ammunition}} {{used the}} Hollow charge principle, which, if the often unreliable round design delivered it <b>correctly</b> to the target, allowed the warhead to penetrate almost all enemy armour types at close range.|$|E
5|$|The breathings (rough {{and smooth}} breathing) and accents (see e.g. Greek diacritics) are given fully and usually <b>correctly.</b> The breathings are {{indicated}} by sigla ⊢ and ⊣, {{often used in}} codices from the 9th and 10th century. In some cases breathings are given incorrectly (e.g. Matthew 9,7.16).|$|E
5|$|The first protein to be sequenced was insulin, by Frederick Sanger, in 1949. Sanger <b>correctly</b> {{determined}} the {{amino acid sequence}} of insulin, thus conclusively demonstrating that proteins consisted of linear polymers of amino acids rather than branched chains, colloids, or cyclols. He won the Nobel Prize for this achievement in 1958.|$|E
