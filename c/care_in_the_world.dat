BBC News has described Dot and Ethel as an [...] "incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious". Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: [...] "Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting on the step of the Vic, waiting for me mother. I {{caught a glimpse of}} her through the door. Sitting on top of the piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out [...] "Roll Out the Barrel". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a <b>care</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel." [...] Critic for The Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith, discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas: [...] "There was always one pretty and pert , and always one in glasses [...]" [...] Banks-Smith adds that theirs was [...] "a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship." ...|$|E
