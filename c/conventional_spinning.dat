40|$|We {{calculate}} the spin Hall conductivity driven by Rashba spin-orbit interaction in p-type two-dimensional semiconductors {{in the presence}} of a perpendicular magnetic field. For a highly confined quantum well, the system is described by a k-cubic Rashba term for two-dimensional heavy holes. The eigenstates of the system can be described by Landau spinor states. First we consider the <b>conventional</b> <b>spin</b> Hall conductivity. The contribution of the interband transitions to the Kubo-Greenwood formula gives the density dependent intrinsic spin Hall conductivity, which approaches its universal value σ^z_xy= 9 e/ 8 π for weak spin-orbit coupling and low Fermi energies, in agreement with previous work. However two intraband contribution terms cancel this effect leading to zero <b>conventional</b> <b>spin</b> Hall conductivity. Adding the torque dipole contribution to the definition of spin current, we also study the effective spin conductivity. This is shown to be proportional to the total magnetization plus surface terms which exactly cancel it for small spin-orbit coupling. If in low magnetic field the intraband transitions evolve to vertex corrections, the fact that both effective and <b>conventional</b> <b>spin</b> Hall conductivities vanish is unexpected. This suggests that the zero magnetic field limit of the model is singular. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures. will appear in PRB 7...|$|R

50|$|Ring laser {{gyroscopes}} {{can be used}} as {{the stable}} elements (for one degree of freedom each) in an inertial reference system. The advantage of using an RLG is that there are no moving parts (apart from the dither motor assembly, see further description below and laser-lock), compared to the <b>conventional</b> <b>spinning</b> gyroscope. This means there is no friction, which in turn means there will be no inherent drift terms. Additionally, the entire unit is compact, lightweight and virtually indestructible, making it suitable for use in aircraft.

40|$|Several {{thousand}} independent {{processes are}} required to produce a single semicon-doctor chip. This thesis focuses on one: the process of coating a silicon wafer with photoresist. The <b>conventional</b> <b>spin</b> coating method produces uniform photoresist coating of the desired thickness. However, <b>conventional</b> <b>spin</b> coating wastes 95 % of the photoresist applied for every batch process. As photoresist is not recyclable, spin coating method is very inefficient. Moreover, an imminent increase in cost of photoresist has raised the demand for new coating technologies. Various methods for improving coating efficiency have been investigated. Based upon a comprehensive literature search and theoretical analysis, dramatic increases in efficiency and reductions in costs proved to be possible with the optimization of the dispense stage in spin coating. In the novel dispense process developed in this thesis, extrusion-spin coating replaces the conventional dispense stage. A major advantage of this method is its compatability with current spin coating method: little modification of existing spin coaters is required for this new technology...|$|R

30|$|DRCS {{is a type}} of <b>conventional</b> <b>spinning</b> process; therefore, it {{has many}} of the same {{advantages}} as <b>conventional</b> <b>spinning.</b> For example, rollers apply pressure to the local section of a workpiece, which produces local plastic deformation. Therefore, less force is needed than that in conventional pressure processing. Thus, the forming load capacity and equipment cost of DRCS is significantly reduced. In addition, DRCS can produce the products with high mechanical strength and good surface quality. It is worth mentioning that DRCS has some advantages that <b>conventional</b> <b>spinning</b> lacks.|$|E

30|$|<b>Conventional</b> <b>{{spinning}}</b> is a single-roller spinning process. Because {{only one}} roller is used, {{one side of}} the sheet metal bears severe asymmetrical spinning force, which can easily cause wrinkling. And point contact between the single roller and sheet metal causes very small plastic deformation after each spinning pass, which leads to more spinning passes and low production efficiency. Furthermore, conventional single-roller spinning requires the use of different sizes of rollers for different materials, shapes, and sizes of spun parts. These rollers have complex surface profiles, terrible stress conditions, low life cycled, and high manufacturing costs. In contrast, the new DRCS process uses two cylinder rollers with simple shapes and low costs to symmetrically clamp the sheet metal which bears compressive stress. Because there is sufficient pressure in the thickness direction, {{it is not easy to}} cause sheet wrinkling, and the spun parts have high dimensional accuracy. In contrast with <b>conventional</b> <b>spinning,</b> the DRCS process involves line contact between the rollers and sheet metal. Thus, the loading action area is larger than that in <b>conventional</b> <b>spinning,</b> and the plastic deformation in each spinning pass is larger. Consequently spinning efficiency is higher. In addition, in the DRCS process, the shape of the final parts is determined by the roller path, not by the profile of the mandrel, which is different from <b>conventional</b> <b>spinning</b> processes. That is, DRCS is a dieless, flexible spinning process that can be used to produce a variety of shapes of flanges, including rectangular flanges.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{hairiness}} of Solospun yarns with <b>conventional</b> ring <b>spun</b> worsted yams {{of the same}} specifications. A 24 -spindles worsted ring spinning frame is used to spin the Solospun and <b>conventional</b> ring <b>spun</b> yarns at the same time, and yarn hairiness is measured. The total hairiness number (Tp), the number of hairs longer {{than or equal to}} 3 mm (S 3), the percentage of longer hairs in total hairs (100 S 3 /Tp), and the total hair length per unit yarn length (K 2 ̆ 7) are used to compare the hairiness of these yams. The results indicate that the Solospun yarn exhibits less hairiness in each of the hair length groups and has lower variations in yarn hairiness. The hair-length distribution of the Solospun yarn follows an exponential law just like <b>conventional</b> ring <b>spun</b> yams. There is a statistically significant difference between the Solospun and <b>conventional</b> ring <b>spun</b> yams for T p, S 3, and K 2 ̆ 7, but the difference in 1 00 S 3 /Tp is not statistically significant for these yams.

Roy et al. [23] constructed a novel industrial-scale apparatus and carried out spinning process experiments for a common aluminum automotive casting alloy (A 356) at elevated temperatures. In addition, they established a coupled thermomechanical FE model with the various thermal and mechanical processing steps, and simulated the spinning process.

40|$|<b>Conventional</b> <b>spinning</b> is {{a widely}} used metal forming process to {{manufacture}} rotationally axis-symmetric and asymmetric products. Considerable efforts {{have been made to}} investigate the forming quality of spun parts using the process in recent years. However, inherent uncertainty properties involved in the spinning process are rarely considered in previous studies. In this paper, an uncertainty analysis and process optimisation procedure have been developed and implemented on <b>conventional</b> <b>spinning</b> with 3 D Finite Element Method (FEM). Three process variables are randomized by Gaussian distribution to study the probabilistic characteristics of two process responses. Linear and quadratic approximate representations are constructed by Monte Carlo based Response Surface Method (RSM) with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). The Most Probable Point (MPP) method, which has been widely used to estimate the failure probability in other applications, is further developed in this paper to obtain the probability distribution of the system responses. Following an evaluation of the system responses conducted by the MPP method, a control variable method is used to reduce the variance of spun part wall thickness and total roller force to satisfy the 3 σ quality requirement. This uncertainty analysis and process optimisation procedure can be easily implemented in other metal spinning processes. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E

The present study deals with the dynamic FEM code, LS-DYNA, to simulate the <b>conventional</b> <b>spinning</b> processes based on the updated Lagrangian formulation. The applications of the mass scaling technique and contact algorithm between the roller and sheet are modeled. The modeling also considers the elasto-plastic material and Coulomb friction conditions. With the differences being variations in the rotation speed of the mandrel, the feed rate of the roller, and the material density. The predicted load-deformation relationships, the strain energy distributions, the full history of deformation states, and the influence and usage of the mass scaling factor are assessed. Some defects in the simulations are observed, and proper solution models are suggested. Besides, some results of the dieless spinning process using a cylindrical mandrel are compared with the <b>conventional</b> <b>spinning</b> process. The proposed models and techniques are helpful for the analysis of the spinning process, and will be a good approach for industrial metal forming simulation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{new insights}} into gaps in the knowledge of <b>conventional</b> <b>spinning</b> and single point incremental forming (SPIF) processes through numerical modelling of their deformation mechanics. The deformation mechanics of <b>conventional</b> <b>spinning</b> is investigated by constructing finite element (FE) models of a cylindrical cup using both single and dual roller passes. A design of experiments (DOE) technique is used to generate an experimental plan based on all the relevant process parameters, followed by {{an analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) approach which is then used to determine the most critical parameters. The results indicated that the area in which most of the plastic deformation is taking place changes during the subsequent passes. The deformation mechanics of SPIF is investigated by constructing a novel dual-level finite element model of the forming of a truncated cone. The first-level FE model is validated against experimental data and the second level FE model is used to investigate the deformation modes through the sheet thickness. DOE and ANOVA techniques are used to investigate the influence of the different process parameters on the predicted through-thickness shear. Simple strategies are applied to reduce the geometrical errors without affecting the process flexibility. The results of the second-level FE model indicated that through-thickness shear is an important component in the deformation mechanism in SPIF.
