40|$|In this work, we {{consider}} the detection of manoeuvring small objects with radars. Such objects induce {{low signal to noise}} ratio (SNR) reflections in the received signal. We consider both <b>co-located</b> <b>and</b> <b>separated</b> transmitter/receiver pairs, i. e., mono-static and bi-static configurations, respectively, as well as multi-static settings involving both types. We propose a detection approach which is capable of coherently integrating these reflections within a coherent processing interval (CPI) in all these configurations and continuing integration for an arbitrarily long time across consecutive CPIs. We estimate the complex value of the reflection coefficients for integration while simultaneously estimating the object trajectory. Compounded with this is the estimation of the unknown time reference shift of the separated transmitters necessary for coherent processing. Detection is made by using the resulting integration value in a Neyman-Pearson test against a constant false alarm rate threshold. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a simulation example with a very low SNR object which cannot be detected with conventional techniques.

40|$|Better-ear glimpsing is an {{auditory}} {{process that}} {{takes advantage of}} short-term interaural level differences (ILDs) to improve the understanding of speech in spatial fluctuating noise. Since ILDs are mainly present at high frequencies, where most hearing-impaired (HI) listeners have the strongest hearing loss, HI individuals cannot fully utilize ILDs for better-ear glimpsing, which may lead to poorer understanding of speech in noise. This problem may be alleviated by hearing aids that artificially generate ILDs at low frequencies where hearing is typically less impaired. The present study therefore investigated the spatial benefit in speech intelligibility that is provided by better-ear glimpsing with low-frequency extended ILDs in a symmetric two-distractor speech background. Speech reception thresholds were measured in a spatially <b>co-located</b> <b>and</b> <b>separated</b> condition {{as a function of}} frequency region in ten normal-hearing (NH) and ten mild-to-moderate sensorineural HI subjects. In both groups the extended ILDs provided a substantial spatial advantage on top of the advantage already provided by natural ILDs. Moreover, the spatial advantage was largely independent of frequency region, suggesting that both NH and HI subjects can utilize low-frequency ILDs for improving speech understanding in noise. Overall performance as well as spatial advantage was reduced in the HI group. 14 page(s...|$|E
30|$|An {{exploration}} {{is performed}} in [34] {{of the concept}} of self-recharging of sensor nodes in a network system powered by an IPS. The study exploited a full-duplex mode of communication in a co-located energy transmitter and information receiver architecture that transmits/receives over an in-band frequency such that the energy transmitter as well as the information receiver carries out their communications over a single-frequency band in a simultaneous fashion. The employed communication mode may be advantageous in improving the spectral efficiency of the operating frequency; however, it suffers from interference problems as the energy transmitter that co-locates with the information receiver causes a complex co-channel interference issue. Since full-duplex communication allows simultaneous communications, the sensor nodes in the full-duplex system in [34] performs data transmission and energy reception concurrently. The network sensor nodes also perform self-recharging as they transfer their independent information. These processes make the system complex as the network sensor nodes are faced with a strong self-interference that causes corruption of data transmissions. Interference cancelation techniques are employed; however, it is difficult to achieve perfect cancelation of self-interference in a wireless channel. The interference issues in turn affect the system’s overall performance in terms of energy efficiency and achievable throughput rate. The complexity associated to the work in [34] is circumvented in this paper by exploring a half-duplex communication mode in both <b>co-located</b> <b>and</b> <b>separated</b> energy transmitter and information receiver architectures operating in separate time-slots over a single-frequency band. The employed technique in this paper is cost-effective and alleviates the problem of interference faced by the full-duplex approach operating in in-band. The application of both co-located and separate energy transmitter and information receiver architectures employed in this paper tackles the practical doubly-near-far issue faced by the co-located architecture adopted by [34].|$|E

40|$|Most {{bilateral}} {{cochlear implant}} (CI) users have horizontal sound-source localisation and speech perception in noise that {{is better than}} that of unilateral CI users and worse than that of normal-hearing listeners. The discrepancy between bilateral CI users and normal-hearing people is thought to partly represent technical limitations in current CI signal processing, which hinders the use of interaural time and level differences. One such limitation is the independent and unsynchronised signal processing in the two CIs. The Digisonic® SP Binaural (DSPB) CI aims to improve binaural hearing by providing synchronised processing of the acoustical inputs, using a single speech processor and two microphones. Two further studies have been published since the commencement of this research project on the spatial hearing ability of DSPB users. Although both these studies concluded that both horizontal sound-source localisation and speech perception in noise can be accessible though the DSPB CIs, consistently with what is provided by conventional bilateral CIs, these studies have some limitations that may have influenced their conclusions. For example, the way the localisation data of their subjects were analysed does not help to determine whether DSPB CI subjects can localise sounds at better than expected from guessing and whether their localisation ability is based on interaural cues or monaural cues introduced by the head shadow. Spatial benefits for speech perception were also not fully reported by the previous studies. The aim of the studies reported in this thesis was to address {{the limitations of the}} previous studies and explore in more depth the spatial benefits of the DSPB CIs. The spatial benefits experienced by eight DSPB CI subjects were assessed in horizontal sound-source localisation, speech perception in noise and self-reported measures. Their ability was also compared to eight unilateral CI subjects, who were chosen as likely to be representative of the better unilateral CI performers. Results showed {{that the majority of the}} postlingually deaf DSPB subjects could localise sounds at a better than chance range, defined by unbiased and biased guessing, which seems similar to previous results with conventional bilateral CI adults. Although the results for unilateral CI subjects indicate that monaural cues may provide some useful information for localisation, such cues were found to provide lower localisation accuracy than binaural cues provided by DSPB implants. Speech perception thresholds were also assessed with the speech and noise spatially <b>co-located</b> <b>and</b> <b>separated.</b> Results showed that, as with unilateral CI subjects, the DSPB subjects were not able to take advantage of separating speech from noise for speech perception. Results from the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale indicated better self-reported spatial hearing ability for the DSPB than unilateral CIs groups, although it was not statistically significant. It is concluded that the DSPB CIs seem to provide advantages for horizontal localisation over unilateral CIs for the majority of postlingually deaf DSPB adults. There is, however, no evidence that the way the processing is synchronised in the DSPB CIs can offer any advantages over conventional bilateral CIs for localisation...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about doing test runs at an LTE base station at Telenor at Fornebu. The tests are {{performed}} {{to find out}} how good the systems work, and specifically for this thesis to explore the possibilities of spectral bandwidth gain exploiting multiple antenna and spatial multiplexing. All tests were done by vehicle at Oksen&# 248;ya outside Oslo. The tests were done at approximately between 20 and 40 kph. The main tests resulted in 16 test-files with combinations of 4 different physical antenna configurations and 4 different transmission modes, driving theroute in both directions. Since Telenor's equipment at the moment only supports 2 x 2 MIMO, therewas no testing of higher channel ranks than 2. The antenna configurations was combinations of co-polarity <b>and</b> cross-polarity <b>and</b> <b>co-located</b> <b>and</b> distance <b>separated</b> antennas. The interesting aspect of this thesis is to fin if it is possible to use co-located antennasonly for 2 x 2 MIMO, 4 x 2 MIMO and 4 x 4 MIMO, which may result in large outcome savings when deploying LTE for commercial use. It was not expected to perform as good as a distance separated antenna configuration. The results was not concluding, but gave an indication to that the MIMO performance will suffer dramatically from this setup, and leaves the question of what will be the best solution.

40|$|The current {{experiment}} investigated whether better-ear glimpsing {{can explain}} the spatial release achieved by normal-hearing adults when situations are high in informational masking. Both modeling and behavioral methods were used. The speech reception thresholds of 38 young adults were measured for <b>co-located,</b> spatially <b>separated</b> <b>and</b> two better-ear glimpsed conditions. In the better-ear glimpsed conditions the binaural signals were processed so that in each time-frequency segment, the signal with the better SNR (left or right ear) was presented diotically. To investigate the effect of widening auditory filters on better-ear glimpsing, adjacent frequency bands were combined {{in one of the}} better-ear glimpsing conditions. Twenty-two participants were tested with maskers high in informational masking, while 16 participants were tested with maskers lower in informational masking. The mean speech reception thresholds achieved in the glimpsed conditions were significantly worse than in the spatially separated condition. This suggests that better-ear glimpsing can explain some but not all of the observed spatial release from masking. The difference between performance in the spatially <b>separated</b> <b>and</b> glimpsed conditions was largest when informational masking was high, suggesting better-ear glimpsing may release energetic rather than informational masking. Reducing the number of frequency bands sampled had a small effect on performance. 9 page(s...|$|R

However, the comparative effectiveness of <b>co-located</b> <b>and</b> distributed AARs is unknown. Thus, {{the objective of the}} present study was to investigate the comparative effectiveness of <b>co-located</b> <b>and</b> distributed AARs. The present study examined the AAR?s effect on performance, declarative knowledge, team-efficacy, team voice, team cohesion, and team-level reactions. Data were obtained from 492 undergraduate students (47. 66 % female) assigned to 123 4 -person teams who participated in a team training protocol using a 3 (type of AAR review: non-AAR versus subjective AAR versus objective AAR) x 2 (geographic dispersion: <b>co-located</b> <b>and</b> distributed training environments) x 3 (sessions) repeated measures design. The results indicate that AAR teams had significantly higher performance scores than the non-AAR teams. In addition, the AAR teams had higher perceptions of team-efficacy and higher levels of team cohesion than the non-AAR teams. With the exception of team-level reactions, there were no other significant differences between the distributed AAR <b>and</b> <b>co-located</b> AAR conditions. Similarly, there were no significant differences across any of the outcome variables between the objective and subjective AAR conditions, indicating that the type of AAR did not impact the results of the training. The findings of the present study highlight several practical and scientific implications that should be considered regarding AAR training. Primarily, regardless of the training environment or type of AAR, AAR training remains an effective intervention at increasing performance and attitudinal-based outcomes. In addition, the results suggest that the use of distributed AARs does not engender the proposed process losses that were hypothesized. Thus, the use of this training to reduce administrative costs may be a viable option for geographically dispersed organizations. Finally, practitioners should evaluate the extent to which increasing the amount of technology to allow for a more objective performance review, is providing the intended benefit to the trainees. The empirical research has consistently demonstrated that the use of objective review systems provides little to no benefit to the trainees. Future research is needed to determine the generalizability of these findings to other tasks, domains, team types, and levels of expertise...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collection}} of seven papers reporting a research effort that started in January 1999. The theme of the thesis is interaction support for mobile CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work). The interest in this theme is motivated by the trend towards a networked and nomadic society, the technical trends towards embedded, ubiquitous, and mobile technology, and the emergence of mobile CSCW settings. It is also motivated by current trends within the area of CSCW to focus on actual work practices, invisible and ubiquitous computer support, and mobile work settings where interaction with others is critical to get the work done. For some time now mobile technology has been widely used to support dispersed mobile interaction, and recently the importance of co-located ”mobile meetings” to get the work done, has been recognized in the area of CSCW. However, current technology is not well suited when it comes to support interaction in mobile work settings across <b>co-located</b> <b>and</b> dispersed settings. Here, this problem is approached from an informatics perspective. Informatics can be described as a theory and design oriented study of information technology use. The scope of this thesis can be defined as understanding transformations of work practice through the use of mobile technology, and how it might be supported. The overall research question is: What are the specific needs of interaction support related to mobile meetings and dispersed interaction, how might these be supported, and what are the implications for current interaction models and support within CSCW? To answer this question several activities have been undertaken. This thesis contains empirical studies of mobile work among service technicians at Telia Nära, models of mobility and mobile meetings, and design and evaluations of a prototype system called RoamWare. The overall conclusions related to the question stated in this thesis are that mobile interaction can be described as ongoing across mobile meetings, including both <b>co-located</b> face-to-face <b>and</b> dispersed interaction. Further, the interaction is maintained by the mobile workers through their efforts of re-establishing different threads of interaction across <b>co-located</b> <b>and</b> dispersed settings. Overall: There is a need to bridge <b>co-located</b> <b>and</b> dispersed meetings with sustained interaction support. Concerning {{the second part of the}} overall research question one conclusion is that sustained interaction across <b>co-located</b> <b>and</b> dispersed settings can be supported with mobile physical/virtual meetings support systems through the use of personal and public interaction histories. To illustrate and test this idea a prototype system called RoamWare was developed. However, evaluations of RoamWare revealed that synchronous support for sustained interaction divides users’ attention between <b>co-located</b> <b>and</b> dispersed interaction. As a consequence a second version of RoamWare was developed as an unobtrusive support for sustained interaction in between mobile meetings through seamless reestablishment of different threads of interaction, by offering support for converting interaction histories into project contexts. Finally, and according to the last part of the question stated above, this thesis concludes that current session management models need to be extended to handle sustained and dynamic sessions of interaction across <b>co-located</b> <b>and</b> dispersed mobile meetings and that, techniques for addressing groups need to be extended to enable dynamic addressing of participants in co-located mobile meeting. Finally, the exploration of how to support sustained interaction in between mobile meetings reveals important aspects to consider when trying to automatically frame spontaneous interaction with mobile technology. Directions for future work include questions of how to design filters to support: maintenance, participation in, and negotiation about participation in between, different mobile meetings. Further, more work is needed related to how to capture spontaneous face-to-face interaction technically. Finally, new methods are needed to enable good evaluations of the impact of IT in mobile work settings...|$|R
