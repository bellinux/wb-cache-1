5|$|Panellus stipticus uses a heterothallic, tetrapolar mating system: each {{basidiospore}} develops into a self-sterile mycelium which, when grown alone, remains homokaryotic (i.e., {{with all}} cells genetically identical) indefinitely. Researchers have paired <b>collections</b> of P.stipticus from Japan and Eastern North America, and later, <b>collections</b> from New Zealand and Russia. Although the separated allopatric populations differ in bioluminescence and taste, {{the results revealed}} a universal intercompatibility group over these geographical regions. In a 2001 study, Jin and colleagues also paired geographically representative <b>collections</b> of the fungus, but observed a reduced ability to cross between Northern Hemisphere and Oceanian <b>collections,</b> {{as well as between}} and within Oceanian <b>collections.</b>|$|E

5|$|Additional <b>collections,</b> then still {{believed}} to be T.toomansis, were made from South Australia in 1952, again on dead cones of unspecified Banksia, and also in 1956 on dead cones of Banksia marginata. In 1957 and 1958, R. W. G. Dennis redescribed the species, and after consultation with Canadian mycologist James Walton Groves, who had earlier completed a monograph on the genus Tympanis, transferred the taxon to the genus Encoelia (family Sclerotiniaceae). Encoelia species are small, tough, brownish discomycetes that typically grow in clusters on hardwood or woody substrates.
