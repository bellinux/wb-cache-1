If, as the one variable increases, the other decreases, the rank correlation coefficients will be negative. It is common to regard these rank correlation coefficients as alternatives to Pearson's <b>coefficient,</b> used either {{to reduce the amount}} of calculation or to make the <b>coefficient</b> less sensitive to non-normality in distributions. However, this view has little mathematical basis, as rank correlation coefficients measure a different type of relationship than the Pearson product-moment correlation <b>coefficient,</b> and are best seen as measures of a different type of association, rather than as alternative measure of the population correlation <b>coefficient.</b>|$|E

This hypothesis is tested by computing the coefficient's t-statistic, as {{the ratio of the}} <b>coefficient</b> estimate to its standard error.
