40|$|Typical {{display screens}} are rigid and static, and they display the entire {{content in the}} same {{diffused}} manner. Furthermore, a screen’s material can’t be changed dynamically. However, in the real world, objects consist of dif-ferent materials, with most materials having a distinguishing reflectance. It would be useful if a screen could reproduce a material’s reflectance. We aim to achieve this by changing the screen’s optical state. When digital content is shown on a static surface, {{a significant amount of}} information is lost, including information regarding color, shape, depth, texture, and material. An object’s appearance is determined mainly by its con-stituent materials ’ reflectance. If we could control this reflectance on the screen, we would no lon-ger need to simulate certain ma-terials by adjusting the bright-ness. In a previous study, we used ultrasonic phased arrays to control the reflectance of a <b>colloidal</b> <b>display</b> made of soap film. 1 We’ve extended that research by determining how to reproduce a material’s reflectance and evaluating the reproduced appearances. By alternating the soap film’s reflectance at high speed through time division multiplexing, we can simulate different materials ’ reflectance, making the display more realistic.

The crystals have potential for magnetic separation of paramagnetic chemical or biochemical entities (e. g., proteins) by providing local magnetic fields at the interstitial sites to promote magnetic retention of the entities of interest. Structural characterizations by transmission electron microscopy and small angle x-ray scattering using a synchrotron source indicate a hcp arrangement of the nanoparticles in the colloidal crystals.

The silicon-based NPs exhibit bright photoluminescence (PL) with a quantum yield of 3. 8 % and peaking at 2. 0 eV, which lies within the transmission window that {{is useful for}} biological imaging.

In this study, we investigate the mechanical response of binary Lennard-Jones glasses to athermal, quasistatic pure shear {{as a function}} of the cooling rate used to prepare them. We find several key results concerning the connection between strain-induced particle rearrangements and mechanical response. We show that more rapidly cooled glasses undergo more frequent and larger particle rearrangements than slowly cooled glasses. We find that the ratio of the shear to bulk moduli decreases with increasing cooling rate, which suggests that more rapidly cooled glasses are more ductile than slowly cooled samples. In addition, we characterized the degree of reversibility of particle motion during cyclic shear. We find that irreversible particle motion occurs even in the putative linear regime of stress versus strain. However, slowly cooled glasses, which undergo smaller rearrangements, are more reversible under cyclic shear than rapidly cooled glasses. Thus, we show that more ductile glasses are also less reversible. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

When interpreted {{within the framework of}} a theoretical phase diagram obtained for <b>colloidal</b> particles <b>displaying</b> short-range attractive interactions, the results show that the formation of aggregates can be interpreted theoretically in terms of a gas-liquid phase separation for aggregates that are amorphous or gel-like. A notable additional feature is the existence of a second aggregation line observed for both ovalbumin and ribonuclease A in ammonium sulfate, interpreted theoretically as the spinodal. Further investigation of ovalbumin and lysozyme reveals that the formation of aggregates can be interpreted, in light of theoretical results from mode-coupling theory, as a kinetically trapped state or a gel phase that occurs through the intermediate of a gas-liquid phase separation. Despite the limitations of simple theoretical models of short-range attractive interactions, such as their inability to reproduce the effect of temperature, they provide a framework useful to describe the main features of protein phase behavior...|$|R

We map the distribution of these transporters with immunolabeling in histological sections of the optic nerve using confocal and electronic transmission microscopy.

We improve the quantitative analysis of confocal micrographs of dense colloidal systems, which allows us to show that methods from simulations of granular materials are useful (but not sufficient) in analysing colloidal systems, in particular colloidal glasses and sediments. Collections of spheres are fascinating in their own right, but also make convincing models for real systems. Colloidal systems undergo an entropy-driven fluid-solid transition for hard spheres and a liquid-gas transition for suitable inter-particle attraction. Furthermore, experimental <b>colloidal</b> systems <b>display</b> a so far not well-understood glass transition at high densities, so that the equilibrium state is not achieved. This may be due to limited experimental timescales, but experiments under reduced gravity (both using the Space Shuttle and densitymatching solvents) suggest that it is not. Most colloidal studies have used scattering (i. e. non-microscopical) techniques, which provide no local information. Microscopy (particularly confocal) allows individual particles and their motion to be followed. However, quantitative microscopy of densely-packed, solidlyfluorescent particles, such as colloidal glasses, is challenging. We report, to our knowledge for the first time, a quantitative measure of confidence in individual particle locations and use this measure in an iterative best-fit procedure. This method was crucial for the investigation of the colloidal samples reported in this thesis. One of the disadvantages of microscopy is that it requires particles too large to be truly colloidal; gravity is no longer negligible. The particles used here rapidly sediment to form solid ”plugs”, which are supposedly ”random close packed” (RCP). At least in some cases, this is not the case, since some particles remain free to move. This observation, as well as some literature results, suggest that gravity has some influence on the structure of the sediment. In this document we consider some ideas from literature not normally considered in colloidal studies. Firstly, we discuss the RCP state, and the preferred Maximally Random Jammed state. Secondly, we borrow a technique designed to identify structures known as bridges in simulations of granular materials. Finding bridges, i. e. structures stable against gravity, in colloidal samples is the primary aim of this thesis. Gravity is important in colloidal sphere packings both in sediments and in glasses; its effect is not known but the best available candidate is bridging. The basic results of this analysis, the bridge size distributions, are close to those for granular systems, but differ little for samples of different volume fractions. We identify important stages of the analysis which require more investigation. Whilst questioning the usefulness of the bridge properties, we identify some related packing properties which show interesting trends. No theoretical predictions exist for these quantities. We investigated initially a non-density-matched system, but compare our results with a nearly density-matched system. The results from both systems are similar, despite the particles apparently acquiring a charge in the latter case. This thesis shows that reliable confocal microscopy of very dense systems of solidly-fluorescent particles is possible, and provides a range of unreported properties of dense sedimenting and sedimented nearly-Brownian sphere packings. It provides several suggestions for further analysis of these experimental systems, as well as some to be performed by those who simulate granular matter.

40|$|Elastin is a self-assembling protein of the {{extracellular}} matrix that provides tissues with elastic extensibility and recoil. The monomeric precursor, tropoelastin, is highly hydrophobic yet remains substantially disordered and flexible in solution, {{due in large}} part to a high combined threshold of proline and glycine residues within hydrophobic sequences. In fact, proline-poor elastin-like sequences are known to form amyloid-like fibrils, rich in β-structure, from solution. On this basis, it is clear that hydrophobic elastin sequences are in general optimized to avoid an amyloid fate. However, a small number of hydrophobic domains near the C terminus of tropoelastin are substantially depleted of proline residues. Here we investigated the specific contribution of proline number and spacing to the structure and self-assembly propensities of elastin-like polypeptides. Increasing the spacing between proline residues significantly decreased the ability of polypeptides to reversibly self-associate. Real-time imaging of the assembly process revealed the presence of smaller <b>colloidal</b> droplets that <b>displayed</b> enhanced propensity to cluster into dense networks.

This article presents a deployment strategy of multiple droplets of different colloidal composition and utilizes the inherent capillary flow driven self assembly of nanoparticles to construct stacks of multiple materials {{on a given}} glass substrate. Here we used aqueous nano-crystalline titania and nano-amorphous silica solutions as the two materials. Initially, a pure nanotitania (nanosilica) droplet is deployed and allowed to dry partially. Subsequently, a second droplet of pure nanosilica (nanotitania) is deployed co-axially on the partially dried precipitate. The proposed deployment strategy allowed significant morphological differences when the deployment order of nanosilica and nanotitania were interchanged. Compositional analysis performed using EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) showed preferential deposition of nanosilica and nanotitania along the radial {{as well as the}} axial plane of the final deposit pattern. The underlying mechanism for such a phenomenon could be attributed to the contact line dynamics of a sessile double droplet.

Stable dispersions of nanoscale colloids find applications in drug delivery, biodiagnostics, photonic and electronic devices, and polymer nanocomposites. Most nanoparticles are unstable in dispersions and polymeric surfactants are added generally to improve dispersability and control self-assembly. However, the effect of polymeric modifiers on nanocolloid properties is poorly understood and design of modifiers is guided usually by empirical approaches. Monte Carlo simulations are used to gain a fundamental molecular-level understanding of the effect of modifiers properties on the thermodynamics and interaction forces of nanoscale colloidal particles. A novel method based on the expanded ensemble Monte Carlo technique has been developed for calculation of the chemical potential of colloidal particles in colloid-polymer mixtures (CPM). Using this method, the effect of molecular parameters like colloid diameter, polymer chain length, colloid-polymer interaction strength, and colloid and polymer concentrations, on the colloid chemical potential is investigated for both hard-sphere and attractive Lennard-Jones CPM. The presence of short-chain polymeric modifiers reduces the colloid chemical potential in attractive as well as athermal systems. In attractive CPM, there is a strong correlation between polymer adsorption and colloid chemical potential, as both show a similar dependence on the polymer molecular weight. Based on the simulation results, simple scaling relationships are proposed that capture the functional dependence of the thermodynamic properties on the molecular parameters. The polymer-induced interaction forces between the nanoparticles have been calculated {{as a function of the}} above parameters for freely-adsorbing and end-grafted homopolymer modifiers. The polymer-induced force profiles are used to identify design criteria for effective modifiers. Adsorbing modifiers give rise to attractive interactions between the nanoparticles over the whole parameter range explored in this study. Grafted surface modifiers lead to attraction or repulsion based on the polymer chain length and grafting density. The polymer-induced attraction in both adsorbing and grafted modifiers is attributed primarily to polymer intersegmental interactions and bridging. The location of the thermodynamic minimum corresponding to the equilibrium particle spacing in nanoparticle-polymer mixtures can be controlled by tuning the modifier properties. Ph. D.

This phenomenon {{is still not}} completely understood and in particular, {{little is known about}} the connection between the flow history, as a determinant of the initial state of the system, and the subsequent aging dynamics. Using a stress controlled rheometer, we perform stress jump experiments to observe the elastic component of the flow stress that remains on cessation of flow or flow quenching. We investigate the connection between the dynamics of these residual stresses and the rate of physical aging upon quenching from different points on the steady state flow curve. Quenching from high rates produces a fluid state, G">G', with small, fast relaxing residual stresses and rapid, sigmoidal aging of the complex modulus. Conversely, quenching from lower shear rates produces increasingly jammed states featuring slowly relaxing stresses and a slow increase of the complex modulus with system age. Flow cessation from a fixed shear rate with varying quench durations shows that slower quenches produce smaller residual stresses at short times which relax at long times by smaller extents, by comparison with faster quenches. These smaller stresses are correlated with a higher modulus but slower physical aging of the system. The characteristic time for the residual stress relaxation scales inversely with the quench rate. This implies a frustrated approach to any ideal stress-free state that succinctly reflects the frustrated nature of these glassy systems.

Following heavy rainfall, very high peaks in pesticide concentration are often observed in shallow UK aquifers. These concentrations might be well explained by colloidal transport of pesticides. We have sampled a Chalk groundwater beneath a deep (30 m) unsaturated zone known to be contaminated with the pesticide diuron. Using a tangential flow filtration technique we have produced colloidal fractions from 0. 45 µm to 1 kDa. In addition, we have applied agricultural grade diuron to a typical chalk soil and created a soil water suspension which was also subsequently fractionated using the same filtration system. The deep groundwater sample showed no evidence of association between colloidal material and pesticide concentration. In comparison, despite some evidence of particle trapping or sorption to the filters, the soil water clearly showed an association between the < 0. 45 µm and < 0. 1 µm <b>colloidal</b> fractions which <b>displayed</b> higher pesticide concentrations. Degradation products were also observed and found to behave in a similar manner to the parent compound. Although colloids can be generated in the Chalk soil zone, it appears transport to depth in a colloidal-bound form does not occur. Comparison with other field and monitoring studies suggests that rapid by-pass flow is less likely to occur beneath 5 m. Therefore, shallow groundwaters are most at risk from rapid transport of high concentrations of pesticide-colloidal complexes. The presence of a deep unsaturated zone will mean that most of the colloidal-complexes will be filtered by the narrow chalk pores and the majority of pesticide transport will occur in a ‘dissolved’ form through the more gradual ‘piston-flow’ route. ...|$|R
40|$|Colloidal gels have {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} promising new class of materials for regenerative medicine by employing micro- and nanospheres as building blocks to assemble into integral scaffolds. To this end, physically crosslinked particulate networks are formed that are injectable yet cohesive. By varying the physicochemical properties of different particle populations, the suitability of colloidal gels for programmed delivery of multiple therapeutic proteins is superior over conventional monolithic gels that lack this strong capacity for controlled drug release. Colloidal gels made of biodegradable polymer micro-or nanospheres have been widely investigated {{over the past few}} years, but a direct comparison between micro- vs. nanostructured colloidal gels has not been made yet. Therefore, the current study has compared the viscoelastic properties and capacity for drug release of colloidal gels made of oppositely charged gelatin microspheres vs. nanospheres. Viscoelastic properties of the colloidal gelatin gels were characterized by rheology and simple injectability tests, and in vitro release of two selected osteogenic proteins (i. e. bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) from the colloidal gelatin gels was evaluated using radiolabeled BMP- 2 and ALP. Nanostructured <b>colloidal</b> gelatin gels <b>displayed</b> superior viscoelastic properties over microsphere-based gels in terms of elasticity, injectability, structural integrity, and self-healing behavior upon severe network destruction. In contrast, microstructured colloidal gelatin gels exhibited poor gel strength and integrity, unfavorable injectability, and did not recover after shearing, resulting from the poor gel cohesion due to insufficiently strong interparticle forces. Regarding the capacity for drug delivery, sustained growth factor (BMP- 2) release was obtained for both micro- and nanosphere-based gels, the kinetics of which were mainly depending on the particle size of gelatin spheres with the same crosslinking density. Therefore, the optimal gelatin carrier for drug delivery in terms of particle size and crosslinking density still needs to be established for specific clinical indications that require either short-term or long-term release. It can be concluded that nanostructured colloidal gelatin gels show great potential for sustained delivery of therapeutic proteins, whereas microstructured colloidal gelatin gels are not sufficiently cohesive as injectables for biomedical applications.
