40|$|This study {{examines}} whether nonhomothetic preferences underlie the "missing trade" problem associated with factor content of trade models. We first find that {{per capita income}} {{goes a long way}} in explaining differences in goods consumption across countries. We then find a striking correlation between the factor content of consumption and per capita income, and show that accounting for this is a key part of resolving the case of the missing trade. However, nonhomothetic preferences over broad <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> play only a small role in this phenomenon. Rather, we find that as income grows, spending is directed towards the relatively capital-intensive version of a given good. Since recent research shows that capital intensity is correlated with quality (Schott, 2004), our results suggest that within-product quality differences are likely important for explaining the factor content of trade, whereas nonhomothetic preferences over broad <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> are much less so.

40|$|This paper {{continues}} {{the study of}} optimal fiscal policy in a growing economy by exploring {{a case in which}} the government simultaneously provides three main <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> with distortionary tax finance: public production services, public consumption services, and state-contingent redistributive transfers. The paper shows that in a general equilibrium model with given exogenous fiscal policy, a nonlinear relation exists between the suboptimal longrun growth rate in a competitive economy and distortionary tax rates. When fiscal policy is endogenously chosen at a social optimum, the relation between the rate of growth and tax rates is always negative. These two conclusions suggest that the interaction between fiscal policy and growth may be complicated enough that it cannot be captured in a simple linear model using an aggregate measure of fiscal policy. The sources of nonlinearity include expectation and coordination of fiscal policy, impluse response of government policies, and the presence of positive externality due to government spending.
