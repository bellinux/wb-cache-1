50|$|Aluminium {{conductor}} steel-reinforced cable (ACSR) {{is a type}} of high-capacity, high-strength {{stranded conductor}} typically used in overhead power lines. The outer strands are high-purity aluminium, chosen for its excellent conductivity, low weight and low cost. The <b>center</b> <b>strand</b> is steel for additional strength to help support the weight of the conductor. Steel is higher strength than aluminium which allows for increased mechanical tension to be applied on the conductor. Steel also has lower elastic and inelastic deformation (permanent elongation) due to mechanical loading (e.g. wind and ice) as well as a lower coefficient of thermal expansion under current loading. These properties allow ACSR to sag significantly less than all-aluminium conductors. Per the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and The CSA Group (formerly the Canadian Standards Association or CSA) naming convention, ACSR is designated A1/S1A.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Transmission {{lines are}} used for {{transportation}} of energy {{from the point of}} generation to the point of usage. A transmission line may be single-core conductor or stranded conductor. Stranding reduces line reactance, skin effect and the tendency of occurrence of corona effect. Transmission line parameters such as inductance and capacitance depend on the geometric mean radius (GMR) of the line. GMR is essential for Voltage and Voltage-Drop analysis which is necessary to ensure save operation of power system. Arithmetic and logical models of triangular, hexagonal, circular and sector shaped stranded conductors are presented. The models which accurately predict the Cartesian coordinates of <b>centers</b> of <b>strands</b> are coded into computer programs which facilitate both the accurate graphical drawing and accurate computation of GMR of stranded conductors...|$|R

These polymers are retained within the cell of synthesis where they cause a toxic gain of function. The serpinopathies are exemplified by inclusions that form with the common severe Z mutant of alpha(1) -antitrypsin that are associated with liver cirrhosis. There is considerable controversy as to the pathway of serpin polymerization and the structure of pathogenic polymers that cause disease. We have used synthetic peptides, limited proteolysis, monoclonal antibodies, and ion mobility-mass spectrometry to characterize the polymerogenic intermediate and pathological polymers formed by Z alpha(1) -antitrypsin. Our data are best explained by a model in which polymers form through a single intermediate and with a reactive center loop-beta-sheet A linkage.

40|$|DNA bulges are biologically {{consequential}} defects {{that can}} arise from template-primer misalignments during replication and pose {{challenges to the}} cellular DNA repair machinery. Calorimetric and spectroscopic characterizations of defect-containing duplexes reveal systematic patterns of sequence-context dependent bulge-induced destabilizations. These distinguishing energetic signatures are manifest in three coupled characteristics, namely: {{the magnitude of the}} bulge-induced duplex destabilization (Î”Î”GBulge); the thermodynamic origins of Î”Î”GBulge (i. e. enthalpic versus entropic); and, the cooperativity of the duplex melting transition (i. e. two-state versus non-two state). We find moderately destabilized duplexes undergo two-state dissociation and exhibit Î”Î”GBulge values consistent with localized, nearest neighbor perturbations arising from unfavorable entropic contributions. Conversely, strongly destabilized duplexes melt in a non-two-state manner and exhibit Î”Î”GBulge values consistent with perturbations exceeding nearest-neighbor expectations that are enthalpic in origin. Significantly, our data reveal an intriguing correlation in which the energetic impact of a single bulge base <b>centered</b> in one <b>strand</b> portends the impact of the corresponding complementary bulge base embedded in the opposite strand.

The pulling was a skilled process, and canes were reportedly drawn to lengths up to 200 ft long. The drawn tube was then chopped, producing individual drawn beads from its slices. The resulting beads were cooked or rolled in hot sand to round the edges without melting the holes closed; were sieved into sizes; and, usually, strung onto hanks for sale.|$|R
40|$|Background: DNA is {{a carrier}} of {{biological}} information. The hybridization process, {{the formation of}} the DNA double-helix from single-strands with complementary sequences, is important for all living cells. DNA microarrays, among other biotechnologies such as PCR, rely on DNA hybridization. However, to date the thermodynamics of hybridization is only partly understood. Here we address, experimentally and theoretically, the hybridization of oligonucleotide strands of unequal lengths, which form a bulged loop upon hybridization. For our study we use in-house synthesized DNA microarrays. Results: We synthesize a microarray with additional thymine bases in the probe sequence motifs so that bulged loops occur upon target hybridization. We observe a monotonic decrease of the fluorescence signal of the hybridized strands with increasing length of the bulged loop. This corresponds to a decrease in duplex binding affinity within the considered loop lengths of one to thirteen bases. By varying the position of the bulged loop along the DNA duplex, we observe a symmetric signal variation with respect to the <b>center</b> of the <b>strand.</b> We reproduce the experimental results well using a molecular zipper model at thermal equilibrium. However, binding states between both strands, which emerge through duplex opening at the position of the bulged loop, need to be taken into account...|$|R
