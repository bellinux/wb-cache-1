In the first trial varying feeding periods with crude <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> naturally rich in fructans (primarily inulin) were tested whereas crude <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> were compared with dried <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> and purified inulin in the second trial. In both trials pigs were infected with 3000 O. dentatum L 3 -larvae while fed a traditional standard diet. When the infections were well established and patent, experimental diets were introduced and the faecal egg counts monitored. Two weeks before the pigs were slaughtered all animals were infected with 3000 O. dentatum L 3 -larvae and 2000 A. suum eggs. In trial 1, substitution of 25 % of the daily energy intake with crude <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> initially decreased the excretion of O. dentatum eggs but slowly increased again over the 9 week feeding period. In trial 2, similar results were seen during a 6 week feeding period while dried <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> almost completely eliminated egg excretion.

40|$|Field {{observations}} in central Belgium indicate a significant soil degradation process which has hitherto not been considered in assessments of soil erosion rates: i. e., soil losses due to root crop harvesting (SLRH). The objectives {{of this study}} were: (1) to assess SLRH for two commonly grown root crops in Belgium, i. e. <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> and sugar beet, (2) to investigate some factors controlling the spatial and temporal variation of SLRH, and (3) to evaluate the contribution of this sail degradation process to overall soil loss in the study area. Soil losses due to harvesting of witloof <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> were assessed by measuring dirt tare from 43 root samples whereas SLRH for inuline <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> and sugar beet were calculated from dirt tare data provided by factories processing these roots. Mean soil loss was 11. 8 ton ha(- 1) harvest(- 1) for witloof <b>chicory</b> <b>roots,</b> 8. 1 ton ha(- 1) harvest(- 1) for inuline <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> and 9. 1 ton ha(- 1) harvest(- 1) for sugar beet. Assuming that root crops are grown once in 2 years in the study area, mean annual SLRH equals 5. 0 ton ha(- 1) year(- 1) (0. 33 mm/year). Since these root crops have been grown {{over a period of}} at least 200 years in Belgium, this implies a mean sail profile truncation of 66 mm. However, important spatial and temporal variability in SLRH data was observed, depending on soil texture, soil moisture at harvest time and harvesting technique. Given the importance of SLRH, it needs to be incorporated into future assessments of soil degradation processes and sediment budgets. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Background: Cichorium intybus L. {{commonly}} known as chicory {{is one of the}} important medicinal plants commonly used in Ayurvedic system of medicine. It is commonly used for the treatment of diseases involving a khapa and pitta doshas. Traditionally, C. intybus is used for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, but there are only few in vitro studies reporting the anti-inflammatory activity of <b>roots</b> of <b>chicory.</b> Objective: Evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity of <b>roots</b> of <b>chicory</b> and mechanisms involved in it using in vivo models of inflammation. Materials and Methods: Albino Wistar rats of either sex weighing 150 - 200 g were used. Ethanolic and aqueous extracts of <b>roots</b> of <b>chicory</b> were prepared with the help of Soxhlet′s apparatus. The anti-inflammatory activity was studied using carrageenan-induced paw edema method and cotton pellet granuloma method. Levels of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL- 6), and IL- 1 and activity of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were estimated. Results: <b>Chicory</b> <b>roots</b> demonstrated significant dose-dependent decrease in paw edema in carrageenan-induced paw edema method. <b>Chicory</b> <b>roots</b> diminished the serum TNF-α, IL- 6, and IL- 1 levels. They also significantly attenuated the malonylaldehyde levels and increased the activities of CAT and GPx in paw tissue. Similarly, <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> demonstrated a significant decrease in granuloma formation in cotton pellet induced granuloma method. Conclusion: <b>Chicory</b> <b>roots</b> possess anti-inflammatory activity, and this might be due to the inhibition of various cytokines, antioxidant effects, and their free radical scavenging activity...|$|R

40|$|Boar taint is an {{off-flavour}} of pork caused {{primarily by}} a microbial breakdown product, skatole and a testicular steroid, androstenone.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of inulin-rich <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> (Cichorium intybus L.) on boar taint. In the first of three trials individually penned, entire males and females were given an organic concentrate in which 0 · 25 of the daily energy intake was replaced with crude <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> for 9 or 4 weeks prior to slaughter. In the second trial, entire male pigs were given diets that included, either crude <b>chicory</b> <b>roots,</b> dried <b>chicory</b> <b>roots,</b> or inulin (extracted from <b>chicory</b> <b>roots)</b> for 6 weeks pre-slaughter. In the third trial, intact male pigs were given the dried chicory diet for either 2 or 1 week before slaughter. In all trials the chicory diets were offered on a scale at 0 · 95 of the Danish recommendation for energy intake, and pig performance was compared with a control group given the organic concentrate at 0 · 95 of recommended energy intake plus silage ad libitum. In trial 1 an additional control group was offered the organic concentrate at a daily energy intake level of 1 · 0 of Danish recommendations. The pigs in trials 1, 2, and 3 were slaughtered at an average live weight of 118, 124, and 110 kg, respectively, in order to ensure that they had achieved sexual maturity. Overall, skatole concentrations in blood plasma and backfat at slaughter were reduced to almost zero levels by including crude or dried chicory or inulin in the diet. This occurred irrespective of sex and length of feeding period (1 to 9 weeks). In trial 3 a significant effect on blood plasma concentration was observed after 3 days of feeding a diet containing dried chicory. The only significant reduction in plasma androstenone levels was detected in pigs given the crude chicory for a 9 week duration in trial 1. The production and proportion of lean was generally not affected by the addition of either form of chicory to the diets in trials 1 and 2. Therefore, dried chicory may be the most suitable form for commercial use because it: had no initial adverse effects on food intake, consistently reduced skatole without reducing performance, was easy to handle throughout the entire year and is relatively inexpensive. ...|$|R

Adipose tissue was analyzed for the concentration of androstenone, skatole and indole, while the liver tissue was analyzed for mRNA and protein expressions of 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 β-HSD), sulfotransferase 2 A 1 and heat-shock protein 70 (HSP 70). The results showed that the androstenone concentrations in the adipose tissue of chicory fed pigs were significantly (p < 0. 05) lower and indole concentrations were higher (p < 0. 05) compared to control fed pigs.

Three main underlying mechanisms behind this effect have been proposed in the literature: (i) a high content of fermentable fiber in the hindgut increases the microbial activity, resulting in more tryptophan incorporated as bacterial biomass and thereby leaving less substrate for skatole production (Jensen et al. 1995; Xu et al. 2002); (ii) an increased butyrate production, due to inulin-type fructans in the diet (Falony et al. 2006), reduces sloughing of enterocytes, whereby less endogenous tryptophan from cell debris is available for skatole production (Claus et al. 2003). Both of these mechanisms result in a reduced level of tryptophan as substrate for skatole production. Therefore, (iii) an altered gut microbiota characterized by a lower abundance of skatole-producing bacteria could be expected when adding high levels of dietary fermentable fiber. However, the present study demonstrated that the skatole-reducing effect of <b>chicory</b> <b>root</b> amended-diets is apparently not by inhibiting the growth of skatole-producing bacteria in the pig hindgut.
