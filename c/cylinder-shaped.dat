25|$|Traditionally {{throughout}} Mesoamerica from pre-Columbian times {{into the}} mid-20th century, the masa was prepared by women using a mano (a <b>cylinder-shaped</b> stone like a rolling pin) and metate (a stone base {{with a slightly}} concave top for holding the corn). This method is still used in some places in Mexico.|$|E
25|$|As with DeathSpank, the {{gameplay}} {{world of}} DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue is <b>cylinder-shaped</b> and is rendered without load screens as the player explores its unique goings-on. Gameplay {{is similar to}} Diablo, featuring hundreds of pieces of armor and weapons. Advanced dialog options, similar to LucasArts' Monkey Island series, also play a large part in unfolding the game's story.|$|E
25|$|Injeolmi is {{an example}} of pounded tteok. The {{traditional}} preparation for pounded tteok is made by pounding rice or glutinous rice with utensils called jeolgu and jeolgutgongi or tteokme and anban. Injeolmi (tteok coated with bean powder), garaetteok (가래떡 <b>cylinder-shaped</b> white tteok), jeolpyeon (절편 patterned tteok) and danja (단자 glutinous tteok ball coated with bean paste)” are commonly eaten pounded tteok.|$|E
25|$|The scapula is {{relatively}} straight and about {{six to seven}} times longer than wide; its upper end is missing. Its lower end is connected to a semicircular coracoid. The furcula is broad and more or less U-shaped with its two branches angled at 125°. The forelimb is rather long; its length is equal to 48% of the body length {{in front of the}} pelvis. Especially the hand is elongated as is typical for compsognathids; for a member of that group Scipionyx has a relatively short hand, however. The humerus is straight with a moderately developed deltopectoral crest. The ulna is slender and <b>cylinder-shaped</b> with a length of 70% of that of the humerus. The wrist consists of two elements only: a radial bone capping {{the lower end of the}} radius and a disc-shaped bone below it; this is either the enlarged first lower carpal or a perfect seamless fusion of the first and second lower carpal. The metacarpus is compact and moderately elongated. Its three elements mirror the shape of the fingers they bear: the first is the shortest en thickest; the second the longest; and the third is intermediate in length and thickness. The third finger is exceptionally long for a comspognathid, with 123% of thumb length. As the lower joint of the first metacarpal is bevelled, the thumb diverges medially. Its claw is no larger than that of the second finger. The hand claws are moderately curved.|$|E
500|$|Smaller cacti may be {{described}} as columnar. They consist of erect, <b>cylinder-shaped</b> stems, {{which may or may}} not branch, without a very clear division into trunk and branches. The boundary between columnar forms and tree-like or shrubby forms is difficult to define. Smaller and younger specimens of Cephalocereus senilis, for example, are columnar, whereas older and larger specimens may become tree-like. In some cases, the [...] "columns" [...] may be horizontal rather than vertical. Thus, Stenocereus eruca has stems growing along the ground, rooting at intervals.|$|E
500|$|The {{main idea}} behind the video is the rise, fall, and revival of Spears herself. The video begins when a {{meteoroid}} heads for Earth, and lights up a city when it finally lands, symbolizing Spears' entrance to fame and her skyrocketing career in the late 1990s as she became a household name. After this, black-and-white interspersed scenes of Spears getting ready in a soundstage are shown, while the words [...] "Britney Spears" [...] and [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] appear in Def Leppard-inspired multicolored letters. Spears is then seen wearing shorts and showing her midriff in the soundstage, while her dancers in white are getting dressed around her. They are surrounded by cameras and lights, symbolizing her constantly being under the microscope and hounded by the media. As the first chorus begins, Spears appears wearing a white wedding dress inside a <b>cylinder-shaped</b> metal room with wires. The futuristic set and flowing dress are reminiscent of Madonna's music video for [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] (1995). She is seen rising up the <b>cylinder-shaped</b> metal room and her past music videos surround her, symbolizing her ever growing career {{in the music industry}} (and possibly referring to the carousel of Logan's Run). When the second verse begins, Spears sings, wearing sparkly red skull-shaped shoulder pads, with microphones around her.|$|E
500|$|In the wild, {{the species}} of Schlumbergera grow either on trees (epiphytic) or on rocks (epilithic) and can form {{sizeable}} shrubs with woody bases; {{a height of}} up to [...] has been reported for one species (S. opuntioides). They are leafless, the green stems acting as photosynthetic organs. The stems are composed of segments, which take one of two forms. In most species the segments are strongly flattened (cladodes), being {{made up of a}} central core with two (or more rarely three) [...] "wings". Special structures characteristic of cacti, called [...] "areoles", then occur at the ends of the segments of the stem. In two species the stems are less flattened, more <b>cylinder-shaped,</b> and the areoles are arranged in a more or less spiral pattern all over the segments. In both cases, the areoles, which may have wool and bristles, are where the flower buds appear.|$|E
500|$|NME {{reported}} that the tour would comprise 250 travelling workers, 69 guitars, 12 trampolines and 100 pairs of kneepads. The stage's layout {{was similar to the}} Confessions Tour stage. It had two giant textile panels that defined the proscenium arch, supporting two giant M-shaped structures, lit from within. The lighting beams and structures were rigged from the ceiling. There were four different clusters of loudspeakers {{in the back of the}} stage, providing sound to the rear tiers. The main stage was accompanied by a catwalk which was shorter than the Confessions Tour one, and a satellite stage at the end of the runway. There was a set of screens on the main stage – which moved and changed shape and layout, from the shape of a cube at the beginning of the show. Also present were two semi-transparent, <b>cylinder-shaped</b> screens, above the satellite stage. Other structures included a number of smaller platforms, ramps, and conveyor belts, which usually were kept beneath the main stage, but were brought out during some of the performances. The catwalks were shaped as a ramp at the very beginning but was transformed into a flat runway eventually. The tour was the first to use a pair of DiGiCo SD7 digital mixing consoles at the sound production's core audio. Tim Colvard, who previously presided as the sound consultant of the 2006 Confessions Tour, decided to use the SD7 technology after researching it. Madonna and her background vocalists used Sennheiser SKM 5200 wireless microphones with the highly directional ME 5005 super-cardioid heads, and Sennheiser in-ear monitors. Monitor engineer Matt Napier commented that he chose [...] "the Evolution systems for backline, as their RF is rock-solid, the transmitter units are small and reliable and they are very competitively priced. [...] And I couldn't imagine giving Madonna another monitor system, she has become so accustomed and comfortable with the IEM G2." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{top of a}} keycap may be {{described}} as <b>cylinder-shaped</b> (curving to the sides as if a fat cylinder was resting on it), flat or spherical (curving to the top, bottom and sides as if a large sphere was resting on it). The modern preference is for <b>cylinder-shaped</b> keycaps rather than spherical ones, but laptop keys are often flat.|$|E
