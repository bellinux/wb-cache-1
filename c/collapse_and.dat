40|$|A {{mechanically}} bistable single-walled {{carbon nanotube}} {{can act as a}} variable-shaped capacitor with a voltage-controlled transition between <b>collapsed</b> <b>and</b> inflated states. This external control parameter provides a means to tune the system so that <b>collapsed</b> <b>and</b> inflated states are degenerate, at which point the tube's susceptibility to diverse external stimuli [...] temperature, voltage, trapped atoms [...] diverges following a universal curve, yielding an exceptionally sensitive sensor or actuator that is characterized by a vanishing energy scale. For example, the boundary between <b>collapsed</b> <b>and</b> inflated states can shift hundreds of Angstroms in response to {{the presence or absence of}} a single gas atom in the core of the tube. Several potential nano-electromechanical devices can be based on this electrically tuned crossover between near-degenerate <b>collapsed</b> <b>and</b> inflated configurations...|$|R

5|$|Through {{ecological}} {{modeling and}} retrospective studies, {{research has shown}} a link between bee colony <b>collapse</b> <b>and</b> climate change. Although the shifting weather conditions themselves negatively affect bees, the link between colony <b>collapse</b> <b>and</b> climate change is also {{closely tied to the}} interaction between bees’ climatic niches and food-plant reductions. Climate change affects the floral environment by stunting flower development and nectar production, which in turn directly impacts colonies’ abilities to collect pollen and sustain themselves.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that Emanuel Swedenborg first proposed parts of the nebular hypothesis in 1734. Immanuel Kant, familiar with Swedenborg's work, developed the theory further in 1755, publishing his own Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, wherein he argued that gaseous clouds (nebulae) slowly rotate, gradually <b>collapse</b> <b>and</b> flatten due to gravity, eventually forming stars and planets.|$|E

5|$|As {{the battles}} at P'ohang-dong raged to the south, the ROK 3rd Division faced {{increasing}} {{pressure from the}} NK 5th Division. North Korean officers from the division continued to attack the ROK unit hoping it would <b>collapse,</b> <b>and</b> the North Korean troops were able to slowly erode at the South Korean division′s defenses, forcing it into a smaller and smaller pocket.

5|$|Charles {{suffered}} a sudden apoplectic {{fit on the}} morning of 2 February 1685, and died aged 54 at 11:45am four days later at Whitehall Palace. The suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison in the minds of many, including one of the royal doctors; however, a more modern medical analysis has held that the symptoms of his final illness {{are similar to those of}} uraemia (a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction). In the days between his <b>collapse</b> <b>and</b> his death, Charles endured a variety of torturous treatments including bloodletting, purging and cupping in hopes of effecting a recovery.|$|E
5|$|England reached 3/106 by stumps on {{the fourth}} day, but the final day started poorly when Compton edged the second ball of the day—bowled by Johnston—to a diving Miller at second slip; he knocked the ball upwards before falling {{on his back and}} {{completing}} the catch as the ball went down. Just as in the first innings, Compton’s dismissal precipitated a <b>collapse,</b> <b>and</b> Australia dismissed England for 186 to complete victory by 409 runs.|$|E
