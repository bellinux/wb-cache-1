40|$|AbstractThe {{tryptophan}} metabolite, quinolinic (2, 3 -pyridinedicarboxylic) acid, {{is known}} as an endogenous neurotoxin. Quinolinic acid can form coordination complexes with iron or copper. The effects of quinolinic acid on reactive oxygen species production {{in the presence of}} iron or copper were explored by a combination of <b>chemical</b> <b>assays,</b> classical site-specific and ascorbic acid-free variants of the deoxyribose degradation assay, and mass spectrometry (ESI–MS). Quinolinic acid showed evident antioxidant activity in <b>chemical</b> <b>assays,</b> but the effect was more pronounced in the presence of copper as transition metal catalyst than in presence of iron. Nano-ESI–MS confirmed the ability of quinolinic acid to form coordination complexes with iron(II) or copper(II) and quinolinic acid stability against oxidative attack by hydroxyl radicals. The results illustrate a highly milieu-dependent quinolinic acid chemistry when it enters reactions as competitive ligand...|$|R

50|$|The {{formalin}} assay is {{the most}} popular <b>chemical</b> <b>assay</b> of nociception. It entails the injection of a dilute solution of formalin into the surface of the rodent's hindpaw, followed by the scoring of stereotypical behaviors such as flinching, licking, and biting of the affected hindpaw. The behaviors last for approximately 1 hour, with the early or acute stage (directly after injection) reflecting direct activation of nociceptors and the late or tonic phase (15 to 20 minutes after the injection) reflecting inflammation. Typically, the formalin assay is used on rats; however, formalin concentrations and scoring methods can be modified as to suit mice. One major advantage of the formalin assay over other models of inflammatory pain is the limited duration (approximately 1 hour) of the response. Additionally, as described before, this assay produces a response in two discrete stages, allowing researchers to model both acute and tonic pain using a single noxious chemical.|$|E

Anthocyanins are naturally occurring antioxidants, that may prevent or reverse such damage.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a quantitative and sensitive <b>chemical</b> <b>assay</b> for cereulide, the heat-stable emetic toxin produced by Bacillus cereus. The methods previously available for measuring cereulide are bioassays that give a toxicity titer, {{but not an}} accurate concentration. The dose of cereulide causing illness in humans is therefore not known, and thus safety limits for cereulide cannot be indicated. We developed a quantitative and sensitive <b>chemical</b> <b>assay</b> for cereulide based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) connected to ion trap mass spectrometry. This <b>chemical</b> <b>assay</b> and a bioassay based on boar sperm motility inhibition were calibrated with purified cereulide and with valinomycin, a structurally similar cyclic depsipeptide. The boar spermatozoan motility assay and <b>chemical</b> <b>assay</b> gave uniform results {{over a wide range}} of cereulide concentrations, ranging from 0. 02 to 230 μg ml− 1. The detection limit for cereulide and valinomycin by HPLC-mass spectrometry was 10 pg per injection. The combined chemical and biological assays were used to define conditions and concentrations of cereulide formation by B. cereus strains F 4810 / 72, NC 7401, and F 5881. Cereulide production commenced at the end of logarithmic growth, but was independent of sporulation. Production of cereulide was enhanced by incubation with shaking compared to static conditions. The three emetic B. cereus strains accumulated 80 to 166 μg of cereulide g− 1 (wet weight) when grown on solid medium. Strain NC 7401 accumulated up to 25 μg of cereulide ml− 1 in liquid medium at room temperature (21 ± 1 °C) in 1 to 3 days, during the stationary growth phase when cell density was 2 × 108 to 6 × 108 CFU ml− 1.
