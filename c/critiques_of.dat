40|$|In {{this article}} it is {{reasoned}} that the classical Marxist <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> religion cannot be regarded as <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> religion per se.

As a sub­ section <b>of</b> his societal <b>critique</b> an evaluation <b>of</b> Marx's <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> religion should above all focus on his arguments which centre on the functional relationship between church and state. It is only in this way that one can account for Marx's <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> religion not being in the first place an atheist onslaught on religion, b u t can see it functioning fundamentally as a critique on the politico-theological arena; thus as a critique for the sake of man and on those aspects/links which deter him in his effort to attain full self-realisation...|$|R

5|$|Fort Lauderdale's {{first major}} {{development}} {{began in the}} 1920s, during the Florida land boom of the 1920s.

In July 1935, an African-American man named Rubin Stacy was accused of robbing a white woman at knife point. He was arrested and being transported to a Miami jail when police were run off the road by a mob. A group of 100 white men proceeded to hang Stacy from a tree near the scene of his alleged robbery. His body was riddled with some twenty bullets. The murder was subsequently used by the press in Nazi Germany to discredit US <b>critiques</b> <b>of</b> its own persecution of Jews, Communists, and Catholics.|$|E
5|$|From the 17th century onward, the Enlightenment {{questioned}} {{the power and}} influence of the Catholic Church over Western society. In the 18th century, writers such as Voltaire and the Encyclopédistes wrote biting <b>critiques</b> <b>of</b> both religion and the Catholic Church. One target of their criticism was the 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes by King Louis XIV of France, which ended a century-long policy of religious toleration of Protestant Huguenots. The French Revolution of 1789 brought about a shifting of powers from the Church to the State, destruction of churches {{and the establishment of}} a Cult of Reason. In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte's General Louis Alexandre Berthier invaded Italy, imprisoning Pope Pius VI, who died in captivity. Napoleon later re-established the Catholic Church in France through the Concordat of 1801. The end of the Napoleonic Wars brought Catholic revival and the return of the Papal States.|$|E

By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with Newsweek science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project.

5|$|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an antisemitic canard, {{originally}} published in Russian in 1903, alleging a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination. The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a cabal of Jewish masterminds, which has co-opted Freemasonry and is plotting to rule the world {{on behalf of all}} Jews because they believe themselves to be the chosen people of God. The Protocols incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the Robison and Barruel attacks on the Freemasons, and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti-Tsarist movements in Russia. The Protocols reflect themes similar to more general <b>critiques</b> <b>of</b> Enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats who support monarchies and state religions. The interpretation intended by the publication of The Protocols is that if one peels away the layers of the Masonic conspiracy, past the Illuminati, one finds the rotten Jewish core.|$|E
5|$|Throughout this period, but {{particularly}} {{in the middle of}} the 18th century, the Bastille was used by the police to suppress the trade in illegal and seditious books in France. In the 1750s, 40% of those sent to the Bastille were arrested for their role in manufacturing or dealing in banned material; in the 1760s, the equivalent figure was 35%. Seditious writers were also often held in the Bastille, although many of the more famous writers held in the Bastille during the period were formally imprisoned for more anti-social, rather than strictly political, offences. In particular, many of those writers detained under Louis XVI were imprisoned for their role in producing illegal pornography, rather than political <b>critiques</b> <b>of</b> the regime. The writer Laurent Angliviel de la Beaumelle, the philosopher André Morellet and the historian Jean-François Marmontel, for example, were formally detained not for their more obviously political writings, but for libellous remarks or for personal insults against leading members of Parisian society.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Critique</b> <b>of</b> Practical Reason (Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, KpV) is {{the second}} of Immanuel Kant's three critiques, first {{published}} in 1788. It follows on from Kant's <b>Critique</b> <b>of</b> Pure Reason and deals with his moral philosophy.|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} Adorno’s conviction that a <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> concepts inevitably entails a <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> society. Some commentators, notably Cook, read Adorno’s {{idea of the}} seamless transition from conceptual to social critique as dependent {{on the use of}} normative concepts. According to this ‘Marxist’ reading, a <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> unfaithful concepts provokes a persuasive and constructive <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> society for failing to fulfil concepts. This line of argument creates problems. Adorno’s inquiries into society’s resistance to decipherment imply that the progression from conceptual to social critique via normative concepts leads to advocating misguided, potentially dangerous social standards. In response to this dilemma, the article proposes an alternative interpretation of the transition from conceptual to social critique. The focus shifts from normative concepts to Adorno’s examinations of society as a condition of false consciousness and suffering. From this perspective, conceptual critique entails a convincing — albeit no longer constructive — <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> society...|$|R
