The result {{of this type of}} test represents a fundamental input data for the software used for structural analysis and the determination of the stress distribution in the structure.The biaxial behaviour at breaking load is an important open issue that has not been investigated thoroughly until now. Previous researches demonstrate the difficulties concerning the rupture of a biaxial sample, it has been noted that generally the maximum biaxial tensile strength is lower than the corresponding ultimate tensile strength obtained by means of a monoaxial test.

40|$|The figure {{depicts a}} {{miniature}} cantilever-type anemometer {{that has been}} developed as a prototype of compact, relatively nonintrusive anemometers that can function at temperatures up to 600 C {{and that can be}} expected to be commercially mass-producible at low cost. The design of this anemometer, and especially the packaging aspect of the design, is intended to enable measurement of turbulence in the high-temperature, high-vibration environment of a turbine engine or in any similar environment. The main structural components of the anemometer include a single-crystal SiC cantilever and two polycrystalline SiC <b>clamping</b> <b>plates,</b> all made from chemical-vapor-deposited silicon carbide. Fabrication of these components from the same basic material eliminates thermal-expansion mismatch, which has introduced spurious thermomechanical stresses in cantilever-type anemometers of prior design. The <b>clamping</b> <b>plates</b> are heavily oxidized to improve electrical insulation at high temperature. A cavity that serves as a receptacle for the clamped end of the cantilever is etched into one end of one clamping plate. Trenches that collectively constitute a socket for a multipin electrical plug (for connection to external electronic circuitry) are etched into the opposite end of this clamping plate. Metal strips for electrical contact are deposited on one face of the other clamping plate. Piezoresistive single-crystal SiC thin-film strain gauges are etched in the n-type SiC epilayer in a Wheatstone-bridge configuration. Metal contact pads on the cantilever that extend into the clamping-receptacle area, are obtained by deposition and patterning using standard semiconductor photolithography and etching methods. The cantilever and the two <b>clamping</b> <b>plates</b> are assembled into a sandwich structure that is then clamped in a stainless-steel housing. The Wheatstone- bridge carrying SiC cantilever with the metal contact pads on the piezoresistors is slid into the receptacle in the bottom clamping plate. The top clamping plate is brought into contact with the bottom plate so that the narrow section of the metal strips on the top clamp plate aligns with the metal contact pads on the cantilever. When the parts are clamped together, the metal strips provide electrical connections between the Wheatstone-bridge contact points and the sides the trenches that constitute the socket for the multipin electrical plug. Hence, to connect the Wheatstone bridge to external circuitry for processing of the anemometer readout, one need only insert the plug in the socket. In operation, the cantilever end of the stainless-steel housing is mounted flush with an engine wall and the unclamped portion of the cantilever is exposed into the flow. The cantilever is deflected in direct proportion to the force induced by component of flow parallel to the engine wall and perpendicular to the broad exposed face of the cantilever. The maximum strain on the cantilever occurs at the clamped edge and is measured by the piezoresistors, which are located there. The corresponding changes in resistance manifest themselves in the output of the Wheatstone bridge...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} universal inequalities for eigenvalues of a <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem on a bounded domain in an n-dimensional hyper-bolic space. It {{is well known}} that, for a bounded domain in the n-dimensional Euclidean space, Payne, Pólya and Weinberger (1955), Hook (1990) and Chen and Qian (1990) studied universal inequalities for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem. Recently, Cheng and Yang (2006) have derived the Yang-type universal inequality for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem on a bounded domain in the n-dimensional Euclidean space, which is sharper than the other ones. For a domain in a unit sphere, Wang and Xia (2007) have also given a universal inequality for eigenvalues. For a bounded domain in the n-dimensional hyperbolic space, although many mathematicians want to obtain a universal inequality for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem, there are no results on universal inequalities for eigenvalues. The main reason that one could not derive a universal inequality is that one cannot find appropriate trial functions. In this paper, by constructing “nice ” trial functions, we obtain a universal inequality for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem on a bounded domain in the hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we can prove that if the first eigenvalue of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem tends to (n− 1) 4 16 when the domain tends to the hyperbolic space, then all of the eigenvalues tend t...|$|R

The {{effectiveness}} of four different carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) hybridized methods to retrofit the high strength concrete columns with shear capacity deficiency {{for improving the}} shear behavior is described in this paper.

30|$|The {{connecting}} element {{is the key}} part to make steel supports yieldable. The steel support should maintain certain resistance force when it retracts, which can not only accommodate some rock deformation, but also restrain too large rock deformation to keep roadways stable. To meet the requirements mentioned above, the mechanical performance of the {{connecting element}} is very important. Any connecting element contains a lock unit and a friction unit. The lock unit binds the overlapping part of two segments in the support and offers compressive force. When the steel support overcomes the frictions between two segments of U-shaped steel and the connecting element, it will retract. According to the locking units, the connecting elements {{can be divided into}} bolt and wedge types. Bolt connecting elements can be subdivided into three types: a U-shaped bolt with clamping plate, double U-shaped <b>clamping</b> <b>plates,</b> and pushing bolt. Wedge connecting elements can also be subdivided into three types: wedge block (single-wedge or two-wedges), ear-shaped wedge, and buckled wedge.|$|E
40|$|Thin spray-on liners (TSLs) {{have been}} {{attracting}} increasing attention {{as an alternative}} to steel mesh in underground roadway support. In order to investigate the shear strength of glass fibre reinforced TSLs, an improved punch test was developed: the steel ring is replaced by TSL plates and four screws are used to tighten the TSL sample between the <b>clamping</b> <b>plates</b> to ensure stable and symmetrical loading. Four different glass fibre contents were tested to evaluate the effect of glass fibre reinforcement on the shear strength of TSLs. The effect of loading rate was studied. The results suggest that the steel punch can shear through the polymer sheet well and the failure mode can be easily identified. The results are consistent and easily calculated. The shear strength increases with glass fibre content. The TSL material samples showed good linear behaviour prior to reaching ultimate load and ductile behaviour that reflects the fibre reinforcement of failed resin during the yielding stage of the sample, which is beneficial to support in underground mines. Although there may be some impact of the shearing rate on the shear strength, the effect is negligible for the loading rates used...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Forming {{tools for}} a press are usually {{machined}} with {{computer numerical control}} (CNC) machine tools. This could be quite time consuming—calculating tool tracks, selecting cutting tools, cutting blanks, design fixation and finally machining—especially for a small batch of parts. One alternative method is to cut a die and draw punch tools from a blank sheet and join the plates together. <b>Clamping</b> <b>plates</b> together is fast and easy to implement by using, for example, threaded rods and guide bars with a certain tolerance to ensure alignment. A laser, a waterjet or a plasma cutter {{can be used for}} cutting plates. The laser and the fine beam plasma cutting in particular are precise methods that give a fine surface quality even without a need for fine-tuning [4]. The method saves material compared with machining because a die and a punch could be cut at the same time from a blank sheet as a compatible pair; in addition, the required number of plates could be estimated depending of the length of a pressed product. The University of Oulu, Oulu Southern Institute and the Future Manufacturing Technology group has manufactured several forming tools within this technique and found it suitable for easily experimenting with different solutions and options. Furthermore, the method is likely to help especially small and medium enterprise (SMEs) in research and development phase by lowering production costs in an efficient way...|$|E

For such <b>clamped</b> <b>plates,</b> the preference of the aspect ratio is 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 for higher enhancement of fundamental frequency. It is evident from the above figures that for the same aspect ratio, the value of ϖ in case of simply supported boundary conditions is much less than that of the same number of stiffeners placed on the <b>clamped</b> <b>plates.</b> Hence, the <b>clamped</b> <b>plates</b> are preferred over the simply supported plates with/without placing any number of stiffeners with any type of orientation. Comparing the aspect ratios, it is observed that the square plates with aspect ratio 1 are more efficient than the rectangular plates having aspect ratios 1.5 and 2.0. Hence, the non-dimensional fundamental frequencies (ϖ) decrease with the increase in aspect ratios.|$|R

Currently, the Biology Department at California State University, Sacramento is {{involved}} with the manufacturing of Water Pasteurization Indicators (WAPIs). These indicators are use to aid developing countries with their water cleaning process. The current manufacturing process has some disadvantages that make the manufacturing inefficient and unsafe. For example, the current devise used to manufacture the WAPIs {{is very difficult to}} use because it requires lots of strength to press the ends of the tubes. This devise also gets extremely hot and is very delicate to adjust the temperature to the required range. If temperature is too low, the polycarbonate tube would break. If temperature is too high, the polycarbonate tubes would melt and stick to the <b>clamping</b> <b>plates.</b> In addition, the heating system is design with parts that are not reliable. The current design is unsafe because part of the heating coil is exposed. Having the heating coil expose might also reduce its life expectancy.

To solve the old device issues, the clamping and heating mechanism was redesign to a more reliable, economical, user-friendly and safer design.
