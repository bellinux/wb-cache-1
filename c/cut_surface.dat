5|$|The thicker {{end of the}} log, the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance. In Montenegro {{it is called the}} head of the badnjak; the main log is laid on the fire with its head {{pointing}} east. In central Serbia the badnjak is laid with its thicker end sticking out from the ognjište. The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs in the coming year. In Gruža it is coated with honey which is then licked by children. At the side of ognjište where the thicker end is situated, the family may place a plowshare, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The <b>cut</b> <b>surface</b> of the thicker end is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak is laid on the fire.|$|E

40|$|Todays {{market of}} {{machined}} products {{is characterized by}} an ever increasing demand in high-quality products, which can be assured by low levels of variability of process conditions. This mostly concerns precise and ultraprecise machining operations, but also more traditional operations are interested, which are far to be completely optimized in terms of obtainable quality of <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The paper presents a system developed in order to monitor in-line the quality of <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> in interrupted machining operations, in particular devoted to sawing of metal tubes. The presence of burrs above an acceptable limit at the <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> entrance and exit is an index {{of the fact that}} the blade teeth have reached unacceptable levels of wear and therefore have to be changed to still guarantee high quality products. The automatic recognition of unacceptable presence of burrs can provide the machine controller with feedback about the need of blade change without the operators aid and, moreover, can reliably predict the residual tool life. In the paper, first the problem will be outlined, then the concept of the system presented together with the software developed for the <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> geometry acquisition; later on, the control chart developed for reliable and automatic monitoring of the process is proposed and main results presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the automatic segmentation of so-called organo-groups (groups of organic objects of similar types). It {{focuses on a}} similarly hard problem, namely the segmentation of wood <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The segmentation of multiple objects on an unknown background in single images is a challenging task. Existing approaches so far are rather special, and are designed for specific objects like tomatoes, apples or fish. Additionally, there is no robust and automatic approach for the segmentation of wood <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> and also none of them is general enough for organo-groups. The segmentation of organo-groups sets the ground for automatic measurement, inspection or sorting. Based {{on the problem of}} wood <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> three concepts have been developed and quantitatively evaluated. The concepts build upon each other and allow the binary segmentation of sawn wood and multi-object-segmentation of wood <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> in images on an unknown background. Based on the three concepts a more general solution has been developed and evaluated using the examples of fish, potatoes and apples. Good to very good results are achieved in the evaluations of the concepts. These results are integrated into a practical measuring system for woodpiles. An evaluation of the system has shown that the concepts are practically applicable under certain frame conditions...|$|R

500|$|The {{thin section}} {{technique}} was superseded by the now-common liquid-peel technique in 1928. In this technique, peels are obtained by cutting {{the surface of}} a coal ball with a diamond saw, grinding the <b>cut</b> <b>surface</b> on a glass plate with silicon carbide to a smooth finish, and etching the cut and the surface with hydrochloric acid. The acid dissolves the mineral matter from the coal ball, leaving a projecting layer of plant cells. After applying acetone, a piece of cellulose acetate is placed on the coal ball. This embeds the cells preserved in the coal ball into the cellulose acetate. Upon drying, the cellulose acetate can be removed from the coal ball with a razor and the obtained peel can be stained with a low-acidity stain and observed under a microscope. Up to 50peels can be extracted from [...] of coal ball with this method.|$|E

40|$|This study {{emanated from}} the {{revision}} of South African mechanistic-empirical pavement design method. At the CSIR road pavement laboratory, the bulk relative density (BRD) of compacted hot-mix asphalt (HMA) mixes is determined on cores and beams with different number of cut/cored surfaces. Significant variations in voids were observed in the HMA core and beam samples from the same compacted slabs. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present the findings of the effect of specimen geometry and <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> on BRD, and the calculated air voids of five South African HMA mixes using the conventional saturated surface dry and the vacuum sealing methods. The BRD results obtained from the two methods showed that the number of <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> significantly affects the BRD of the compacted samples used for this study. However, the BRDs/air voids were comparable regardless of the sample geometry.

2500|$|Gems {{were mostly}} cut by using {{abrasive}} powder from harder stones {{in conjunction with}} a hand-drill, probably often set in a lathe. Emery has been mined for abrasive powder on Naxos since antiquity. [...] Some early types of seal were cut by hand, rather than a drill, which does not allow fine detail. There is no evidence that magnifying lenses were used by gem cutters in antiquity. A medieval guide to gem-carving techniques survives from Theophilus Presbyter. Byzantine cutters used a flat-edged wheel on a drill for intaglio work, while Carolingian ones used round-tipped drills; it is unclear where they learnt this technique from. In intaglio gems at least, the recessed <b>cut</b> <b>surface</b> is usually very well preserved, and microscopic examination is revealing of the technique used. The colour of several gemstones can be enhanced by a number of artificial methods, using heat, sugar and dyes. Many of these can be shown to have been used since antiquity – since the 7th millennium BC in the case of heating.|$|E
40|$|Single-section {{techniques}} are attractive in enamel de- and remineralization investigations because they allow longitudinal {{studies in which}} mineral changes can be assessed by microradiography (TMR), Nail Varnish (NV) is in general applied to coat the cut thin-section sides, The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate: (1) NV penetration depth in <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> of demineralized enamel, (2) the influence of NV on <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> of demineralized enamel on TMR, (3) the influence of NV penetration on a following remineralization, <b>Cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> of thin sections of demineralized enamel were NV coated; the NV was peeled off and the penetration depth assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The NV penetration was 18 +/- 5 mu m (mean+/-SD) in demineralized enamel. To evaluate the possible influence of NV on TMR, <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> of thin sections of demineralized enamel were coated (twice) and microradiographed before and after nail varnishing. The NV effect (total effect of penetrated and surface NV) on the main parameters of TMR, Ld and Delta Z, was less than 5 % of the mean values. In the remineralization experiment (remineralization with 1. 5 mM Ca 2 +, 0. 9 mM phosphate, pH 7, 1 ppm F for 1 and 2 weeks), lesions in bulk samples, lesions in thin sections with NV-coated <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> and lesions in thin sections in a PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) holder were compared. (1) The remineralization of bulk samples and of NV-coated thin sections is different in one aspect. The amounts of mineral deposited in the lesions expressed as Delta Z are comparable after 1 week. But because the NV penetrates part of the lesion outside, there was an Ld difference. The lesion depth difference between bulk lesions and NV-coated lesions in thin sections was statistically significant and was about 19 % less in NV-coated lesions after 1 week; after 2 weeks of remineralization {{there was no difference in}} Ld between bulk- and NV-coated lesions any more.

60|$|Although in {{the case}} of uninjured flower-stems and leaves the {{carbonate}} seems to be absorbed only by the glands, yet it enters a <b>cut</b> <b>surface</b> much more quickly than a gland. Strips of the rind of a flower-stem were torn off, and the cells of the pedicels were seen to contain only colourless transparent fluid; those of the glands including as usual some granular matter. These strips were then immersed in the same solution as before (one part of the carbonate to 109 of water), and in a few minutes granular matter appeared in the lowercells of all the pedicels. The action invariably commenced (for I tried the experiment repeatedly) in the lowest cells, and therefore close to the torn surface, and then gradually travelled up the hairs until it reached the glands, in a reversed direction to what occurs in uninjured specimens. The glands then became discoloured, and the previously contained granular matter was aggregated into larger masses. Two short bits of a flower-stem were also left for 2 hrs. 40 m. in a weaker solution of one part of the carbonate to 218 of water; and in both specimens the pedicels of the hairs near the cut ends now contained much granular matter; and the glands were completely discoloured.|$|E

What this mound, which may perhaps have covered half an acre of ground, was, nobody had any idea. Some learned folk write it down a Saxon tumulus, a presumption to which its ancient name, [...] "Dead Man's Mount," [...] seemed to give colour. Other folk, however, yet more learned, declared it to be an ancient British dwelling, and pointed triumphantly to a hollow at the top, wherein the ancient Britishers were supposed to have moved, lived, and had their being--which must, urged the opposing party, have been a very damp one. Thereon the late Mrs. Massey, who was a British dwellingite, proceeded to show with much triumph /how/ they had lived in the hole by building a huge mushroom-shaped roof over it, and thereby turning it into a summer- house, which, owing to unexpected difficulties {{in the construction of the}} roof, cost a great deal of money. But as the roof was slated, and as it was found necessary to pave the hollow with tiles and <b>cut</b> <b>surface</b> drains in it, the result did not clearly prove its use as a dwelling place before the Roman conquest.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel virtual node {{algorithm}} (VNA) for changing tetrahedron mesh topology to represent arbitrary cutting triangulated surfaces. Our approach addresses {{a number of}} shortcomings in the original VNA of [MBF 04].

The original algorithm did not make sense for these cases and required often ambiguous perturbation of the cutting surface to avoid them. Second, we develop an adaptive approach {{to the definition of}} embedded material used for element duplication. The original algorithm could only handle a limited number of configurations which restricted <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> to have curvature at the scale of the tetrahedron elements. Our adaptive approach allows for <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> with curvatures independent of the embedding tetrahedron mesh resolution.

50|$|The name carbide saw {{came from}} the tool, a {{circular}} saw blade, with silver soldered carbide tips. It competed with and just about replaced, solid or segmental HSS blades, because carbide is much harder than HSS. Before HSS saws were developed, abrasive, friction or hot saws were used and are still manufactured for certain applications. These processes create heat and are therefore called hot saws. However, HSS blades use coolant and the <b>cut</b> <b>surfaces</b> don’t get hot, thus called cold saws. With the unique geometry of the teeth of carbide circular saws, the heat, developed by the cutting process is transferred into the chips and carried away with the chips.
