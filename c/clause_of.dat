5|$|Petit {{jury and}} venue provisionsboth {{traceable}} to enumerated complaints in the Declaration of Independenceare included in Article Three of the United States Constitution. More criminal procedure provisions {{are contained in}} the United States Bill of Rights, specifically the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments. With {{the exception of the}} Grand Jury <b>Clause</b> <b>of</b> the Fifth Amendment, the Vicinage <b>Clause</b> <b>of</b> the Sixth Amendment, and (maybe) the Excessive Bail <b>Clause</b> <b>of</b> the Eighth Amendment, all of the criminal procedure provisions of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated to apply to the state governments.|$|E
5|$|The Due Process <b>Clause</b> <b>of</b> the Fourteenth Amendment {{applies only}} against the states, {{but it is}} {{otherwise}} textually identical to the Due Process <b>Clause</b> <b>of</b> the Fifth Amendment, which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of procedural due process and substantive due process. Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government. The Due Process <b>Clause</b> <b>of</b> the Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights, which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.|$|E
5|$|The Vicinage clause has {{its roots}} in medieval English {{criminal}} procedure, the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period and Anti-federalist objections to the United States Constitution. The clause {{is one of the few}} constitutional criminal procedure provisions that has not been incorporated to apply to proceedings in state courts, along with the Grand Jury <b>Clause</b> <b>of</b> the Fifth Amendment and (possibly) the Excessive Bail <b>Clause</b> <b>of</b> the Eighth Amendment.|$|E

40|$|To know a {{language}} does not only mean to know its vocabulary, {{but how to}} link the words, the word order in a clause {{as well as the}} order <b>of</b> <b>clauses</b> in a sentence, their role and their relations to each other. The relationship <b>of</b> the <b>clauses</b> in a sentence is especially important concerning complex sentences, in which the <b>clauses</b> are not <b>of</b> the same level but show a dependency. So, precisely the adverbial <b>clauses</b> <b>of</b> time {{are the ones that are}} highly complicated and create confusion. For this reason, most of the people try to avoid them, and use simple clauses instead, nevertheless, this somehow loses the meaning and originality of the idea. This means that although complex, adverbial <b>clauses</b> <b>of</b> time are crucial in explaining our ideas and thoughts. Based on the great number <b>of</b> the adverbial <b>clauses</b> <b>of</b> time, on the meanings that they convey as well as on the manner how the meaning is expressed, this paper will concentrate on mistakes that students of English Language make when using adverbial <b>clauses</b> <b>of</b> time.

Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate <b>clause</b> <b>of</b> the auxiliary verb.
