25|$|Ideally, the <b>computational</b> <b>method</b> {{will be able}} {{to predict}} {{affinity}} before a compound is synthesized and hence in theory only one compound needs to be synthesized, saving enormous time and cost. The reality is that present computational methods are imperfect and provide, at best, only qualitatively accurate estimates of affinity. In practice it still takes several iterations of design, synthesis, and testing before an optimal drug is discovered. Computational methods have accelerated discovery by reducing the number of iterations required and have often provided novel structures.|$|E
25|$|To {{calculate}} the kinetics of gait patterns, most labs have floor-mounted load transducers, {{also known as}} force platforms, which measure the ground reaction forces and moments, including the magnitude, direction and location (called the center of pressure). The spatial distribution of forces can be measured with pedobarography equipment. Adding this to the known dynamics of each body segment enables the solution of equations based on the Newton–Euler equations of motion permitting computations of the net forces and the net moments of force about each joint at every stage of the gait cycle. The <b>computational</b> <b>method</b> for {{this is known as}} inverse dynamics.|$|E
25|$|With any <b>computational</b> <b>method,</b> it is {{typically}} necessary to constrain the investigated parameter ranges. The parameter ranges should if possible be defined based on known {{properties of the}} studied system, but may for practical applications necessitate an educated guess. However, theoretical results regarding objective priors are available, which may for example {{be based on the}} principle of indifference or the principle of maximum entropy. On the other hand, automated or semi-automated methods for choosing a prior distribution often yield improper densities. As most ABC procedures require generating samples from the prior, improper priors are not directly applicable to ABC.|$|E

2500|$|ABC {{can be used}} {{to infer}} {{problems}} in high-dimensional parameter spaces, although one should account for the possibility of overfitting (e.g., see the model selection methods in [...] and [...] ). However, the probability of accepting the simulated values for the parameters under a given tolerance with the ABC rejection algorithm typically decreases exponentially with increasing dimensionality of the parameter space (due to the global acceptance criterion). Although no <b>computational</b> <b>method</b> (based on ABC or not) seems to be able to break the curse-of-dimensionality, methods have recently been developed to handle high-dimensional parameter spaces under certain assumptions (e.g., based on polynomial approximation on sparse grids, which could potentially heavily reduce the simulation times for ABC). However, the applicability of such methods is problem dependent, and the difficulty of exploring parameter spaces should in general not be underestimated. For example, the introduction of deterministic global parameter estimation led to reports that the global optima obtained in several previous studies of low-dimensional problems were incorrect. For certain problems, it might therefore be difficult to know whether the model is incorrect or, as discussed above, whether the explored region of the parameter space is inappropriate. A more pragmatic approach is to cut the scope of the problem through model reduction.|$|E
