40|$|Pendred {{syndrome}} is the autosomal recessively transmitted asso-ciation of familial goiter and congenital deafness. There is no specific biochemical marker of this disease, and the diagnosis {{depends upon the}} demonstration of the triad of congenital sensorineural hearing loss, goiter, and abnormal perchlorate discharge test. Pendred syn-drome is caused by mutations within the putative ion transporter gene (PDS gene), located on chromosome 7 q. A wide variation in the clinical presentation of this condition, and its well documented phe-notypic overlap with other thyroid disorders (such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis), can lead to diagnostic difficulties. The potential for mis-diagnosis increases when these disorders occur coincidentally in the same family.

African states have laws and constitutional order and in parallel are ruled by patrimonial logic in which political authority is based on clientelism and office holders constantly appropriate public resources for their own benefit.
