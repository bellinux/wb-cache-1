50|$|The above {{chemical}} name ("3-dimethylheptyl-11-hydroxyhexahydrocannabinol") and common ("canbisol") or trade names ("nabidrox") {{are not the}} same chemical as HU-243. They identify <b>Canbisol,</b> of which HU-243 is a methylene homologue.|$|E
50|$|HU-243 (AM-4056) is a {{synthetic}} cannabinoid drug {{that is a}} single enantiomer of the hydrogenated derivative of the commonly used reference agonist HU-210. It is a methylene homologue of <b>canbisol.</b> It is a potent agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, with a binding affinity of 0.041 nM at the CB1 receptor, making it marginally more potent than HU-210, which had an affinity of 0.061 nM in the same assay.|$|E
50|$|<b>Canbisol</b> (Nabidrox), is a {{synthetic}} cannabinoid derivative {{that is the}} dimethylheptyl homologue of 9-nor-9β-hydroxyhexahydrocannabinol (HHC). It is a potent agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, with a binding affinity of 0.1nM at CB1 and 0.2nM at CB2. It is mainly used in scientific research, in receptor binding studies to determine the structure and function of the cannabinoid receptors, but has been made illegal in some countries due to its possible abuse potential as a cannabinomimetic drug.|$|E
5000|$|Effective January 1, 2016, HU-243 is {{probably}} (a little doubt arises due to apparent mistaken naming) a regulated drug in Vermont {{designated as a}} [...] "Hallucinogenic Drug." [...] “Hallucinogenic Drug” means those specified in Section 7 of this rule including stramonium, mescaline or peyote, lysergic acid diethylamide, and psilocybin, and all synthetic equivalents of chemicals contained in resinous extractives of Cannabis sativa, or any salts or derivatives or compounds of any preparations or mixtures thereof, and any other substance having a hallucinogenic effect in the regulations adopted by the Board of Health under 18 V.S.A.§ 4202....• Cannabimimetic Agents means, collectively, any chemical that is a cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) or cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) agonist, or any salts, isomers, derivatives, or analogs of these chemicals. Structural classes include {{but are not limited}} to:(a) 2-(3-hydroxycyclohexyl)phenol with substitution at the 5-position of the phenolic ring by alkyl or alkenyl, whether or not substituted on the cyclohexyl ring to any extent. (b) 3-(1-naphthoyl)indole or 3-(1-naphthyl)indole with substitution at the nitrogen atom of the indole ring, whether or not further substituted on the indole ring to any extent, whether or not substituted on the naphthoyl or naphthyl ring to any extent. (c) 3-(1-naphthoyl)pyrrole with substitution at the nitrogen atom of the pyrrole ring, whether or not further substituted in the pyrrole ring to any extent, whether or not substituted on the naphthoyl ring to any extent. (d) 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)indene with substitution of the 3-position of the indene ring, whether or not further substituted in the indene ring to any extent, whether or not substituted on the naphthyl ring to any extent. (e) 3-phenylacetylindole or 3-benzoylindole with substitution at the nitrogen atom of the indole ring, whether or not further substituted in the indole ring to any extent, whether or not substituted on the phenyl ring to any extent. (f) indole- (2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropyl)methanone, with substitution at the nitrogen atom of the indole ring, whether or not further substituted in the indole ring to any extent, whether or not substituted on the phenyl ring to any extent. (g) N- adamantyl-indole-3-carboxamide, with substitution at the nitrogen atom of the indole ring, whether or not further substituted in the indole ring to any extent, whether or not substituted on the phenyl ring to any extent. (h) (1,3-thiazol-2- ylidine)-2,2,3,3- tetramethylcyclopropane-1-carboxamide, with substitution to any extent at any position of the thiazolylidine ring.... • HU-243; 3-dimethylheptyl-11-hydroxyhexahydrocannabinol; <b>canbisol,</b> nabidrox ...|$|E
40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} {{effects of}} two new cannabinoids, nabilone and <b>canbisol,</b> have been compared to 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (9 -THC) and chlordiazepoxide. Unanesthetized rabbits, dogs, hypertensive rats and rhesus monkeys have been studied. In rabbits, modest falls in blood pressure and heart rate were produced by 0. 05 mg/kg of i 9 -THC, 0. 064 mg/kg of nabilone and 0. 001 mg/kg of <b>canbisol,</b> all i. v. Chlordiazepoxide had no effect up to 0. 50 mg/kg. In dogs, Lv. 9 -THC caused no cardiovascular changes up to 0. 25 mg/kg, and chlordiazepox-ide had no effect up to 1 0 mg/kg. Nabilone caused a modest delayed increase in blood pressure at 0. 064 mg/kg and can-bisol a modest hypotension at 0. 004 mg/kg, an effect not intensified at hyperdoses. Repeated daily oral administration of <b>canbisol,</b> 0. 1 6 mg/kg, to hypertensive rats led to a fall of 30 mm Hg that was as large after the sixth dose as-after the first...|$|E
