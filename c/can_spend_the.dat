5|$|Mr. Finch's successes have aroused media {{attention}}— in particular, {{the attention}} of investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith. While at first the Doctor feigns ignorance (but is barely able to restrain his pleasure at seeing her again), when Sarah Jane discovers the TARDIS during the night, he reveals his identity to her. Sarah Jane meets Rose and Mickey, with an immediate rivalry sparking between the two women. As the group searches the school, they find thirteen bat-like creatures asleep in Finch's office. Returning to Sarah Jane's car, the journalist reveals a battered, inactive K9 Mark III, who—once repaired—identifies the chip oil as Krillitane oil. Rose, unaware that the Doctor had even had past companions, confronts him; he replies sadly that, while she <b>can</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of her life}} with him, he cannot {{spend the rest of his}} life with her, so he must remain aloof.|$|E
5|$|The player builds their {{character}} by spending acquired points {{to increase their}} ratings in the three areas. The points spent on Attributes and Abilities combine to determine a player's success or effectiveness in performing tasks such as using firearms, brawling, and lock-picking; for example, determining how accurate or how far the player can shoot, or if they can hack a computer. Attributes are represented by physical (strength, dexterity, and stamina), social (charisma, manipulation, and appearance), and mental (perception, intelligence, and wits). Abilities are talents (such as brawling and dodging), skills (such as firearms and melee) and knowledges (such as computers and investigation). The player is initially assigned points to spend in the three areas, with the amount they can spend determined by clan; for example, the Brujah <b>can</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> most points on physical and skill attributes. During character creation, each upgrade costs one point. The upgrade cost increases as the game progresses. Each ability can be raised from zero to five, and {{it is impossible to}} accrue enough experience points to complete every skill (allowing the player to specialize or balance {{their character}}). Experience points are gained by completing quests, finding items or unlocking secret paths, rather than killing enemies, and are used to increase or unlock the character's statistics and abilities. The game features a main story, and optional side quests that can be completed at any time; the player is able to move between the available areas at will to revisit locations, characters, or merchants.|$|E

This service is especially attractive to tourists who <b>can</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> night on the train as it covers the stretch between Cairo and Luxor. A luxury express train also links Cairo with Marsa Matruh towards the Libyan border.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} each chapter, {{the player}} is taken to a vendor, where they <b>can</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> in-game currency, silver pennies. Items {{available}} for purchase include stones, healing potions, antidotes, skeleton keys, temporary invincibility potions, additional health points, and the ability to increase the maximum number of stones and health potions which Bilbo can carry.|$|E
25|$|Protection {{and attack}} - simulates attack and {{distributes}} forces evenly. In this case, one player becomes the protector, {{while the other}} becomes the attacker, you can specify a maximum duration of the battle. Objectives: players are different, the attacker must defeat the enemy and stay within a specified time, and defender - hold on and not give himself into the enemys hands. First, before the battle, {{you can get more}} gold, but the defender <b>can</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> points of construction to strengthen its position: to cut down trees, to build a low wall, oil traps, or Trebuchet.|$|E
25|$|The {{garrison}} in Stirling Castle was {{in danger}} of succumbing to a lack of provisions, if not to Marebelle de Gordon’s siege, and with a sense of urgency Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, commander of the British-Hanoverian forces, departed with his army towards Linlithgow on 31 January 1746 and many of his troops took up their quarters in Linlithgow Palace. On hearing of the Duke’s arrival, Prince Charles sent his Secretary of State, Sir John Murray of Broughton to Lord George Murrray at Falkirk to prepare a battle plan. However Charles had recently received a letter from Lord George Murray explaining how his army had been weakened by desertion, was in no state to meet the enemy, and that it must retreat to the Highlands where it <b>can</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> winter reducing government forts and recruiting itself to a strength of 10,000 men to operate a new campaign in the spring. As a result, the heavy guns on Gowan Hill were spiked and before day break on 1 February 1746 the Jacobite forces at Stirling and Falkirk withdrew making their way towards their rendezvous at St Ninians, abandoning the siege of Stirling Castle.|$|E

25|$|There are a {{large number}} of fair trade and ethical {{marketing}} organizations employing different marketing strategies. Most fair trade marketers believe it is necessary to sell the products through supermarkets to get a sufficient volume of trade to affect the developing world. The Fairtrade brand is by far the biggest of the fair trade coffee brands. Packers in developed countries pay a fee to The Fairtrade Foundation for the right to use the brand and logo, and nearly all the fee goes to marketing. Packers and retailers can charge as much as they want for the coffee. The coffee has to come from a certified fair trade cooperative, and there is a minimum price when the world market is oversupplied. Additionally, the cooperatives are paid an additional 10c per lb premium by buyers for community development projects. The cooperatives can, on average, sell only a third of their output as fair trade, because of lack of demand, and sell the rest at world prices. The exporting cooperative <b>can</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> money in several ways. Some go to meeting the costs of conformity and certification: as they have to meet fair trade standards on all their produce, they have to recover the costs from a small part of their turnover, sometimes as little as 8%, and may not make any profit. Some meet other costs. Some is spent on social projects such as building schools, health clinics and baseball pitches. Sometimes there is money left over for the farmers. The cooperatives sometimes pay farmers a higher price than farmers do, sometimes less, but there is no evidence on which is more common.|$|E
500|$|A year passes, and {{the city}} of Rubacava has grown. Manny now runs his own nightclub off a {{converted}} automat {{near the edge of the}} Forest. Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda that Don has been [...] "sprouted" [...] for letting the scandal be known and that Meche was recently seen with Domino leaving the port. Manny gives chase and a year later tracks them to a coral mining plant on the Edge of the World. Domino has been holding Meche there as a trap to lure Manny. All of Domino's clients who had their tickets stolen are also being held there and used as slave labor, both to make a profit with the coral mining and as a way to keep Hector's scandal quiet. Domino tries to convince Manny to take over his position in the plant seeing as he has no alternative and <b>can</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> rest of eternity with Meche but he refuses. After rescuing Meche, Manny defeats Domino by causing him to fall into a rock crusher.
