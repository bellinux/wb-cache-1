40|$|A <b>confined</b> <b>eddy</b> is a circularly {{symmetric}} flow with vorticity of compact {{support and}} zero net circulation. Confined eddies with disjoint supports can be superimposed to generate stationary weak solutions of the two-dimensional incompressible inviscid Euler equations. In this work, {{we consider the}} unique weak solution of the twodimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations having a disjoint superposition of very singular confined eddies as the initial datum. We prove the convergence of these weak solutions back to the initial configuration, as the Reynolds number goes to infinity. This implies that the stationary superposition of confined eddies with disjoint supports is the unique physically correct weak solution of the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations.

40|$|The FLIP (Fluid-Implicit-Particle) method uses fully Lagrangian {{particles}} {{to eliminate}} convective transport, the largest sourceof computational diffusion in calculations of fluid flow. FLIP is an adaptation to fluids of the implicit moment method for simulating plasmas, in which particles carry everything necessary {{to describe the}} fluid. Using the particle data, Lagrangian moment equations are solved on a grid. The solutions are then used to advance the particle variables from time step to time step. An adaptive grid and implicit time differencing extend the method to multiple time and space scale flows. Aspects of FLIP’s properties are illustrated by modeling of a <b>confined</b> <b>eddy,</b> a Rayleigh-Taylor, an unstable subsonic stream, and a supersonic jet. The results demonstrate FLIP’s instability applicability to hydrodynamic stability problems where low dissipation is crucial to correct modeling. 1.

50|$|The {{effect of}} {{laminations}} is to <b>confine</b> <b>eddy</b> currents to highly elliptical paths that enclose little flux, and so reduce their magnitude.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{results from}} from a one year simulation in the Oslofjord area, produced by an 800 - and 300 - meter {{versions of the}} ROMS model. The two versions differ only in resolution and grid orientation. Our objective is to evaluate {{similarities and differences between}} the two version. To this end we study current patterns, kinetic energy levels and last, but not least, particle trajectories. By doing this we quantify the effect of an increased grid resolution, enabling us to assess what size resolution is required for simulations of the fjord dynamics. We find that a higher skill regarding the representation of bathymetry and coastal geometry in the model grid enables resolution of smaller, stronger and more <b>confined</b> <b>eddies,</b> causing the higher resolution model to be more energetic. Moreover, simulations in areas where the two model grids display diverging coastal geometry and bathymetry produce diverging particle trajectories. In contrast simulations in more open regions where the relative difference in bathymetry is smaller yield more similar trajectories. This conclusion is reached by decomposing the kinetic energy into a mean and eddy part, and inspecting the eddy patterns of the two. We find a correlation between the spatial location of the eddies and the trajectories taken. We conclude, {{that it is not the}} effect of resolution itself that is of major importance in the fjord, but rather the implications it brings in the form of enhanced bathymetry and coastal geometry. Some other more obvious findings are that a more natural coastal geometry preclude/permit certain trajectories. Moreover, the inclusion of islands in the model domain obstructs eddy generation, and possibly cause island wakes...|$|R

50|$|Solid or tubular {{conductors}} may be silver-plated to {{take advantage}} of silver's higher conductivity. This technique is particularly used at VHF to microwave frequencies where the small skin depth requires only a very thin layer of silver, making the improvement in conductivity very cost effective. Silver plating is similarly used on the surface of waveguides used for transmission of microwaves. This reduces attenuation of the propagating wave due to resistive losses affecting the accompanying eddy currents; the skin effect <b>confines</b> such <b>eddy</b> currents to a very thin surface layer of the waveguide structure. The skin effect itself isn't actually combatted in these cases, but the distribution of currents near the conductor's surface makes the use of precious metals (having a lower resistivity) practical. Although it has a lower conductivity than copper and silver, gold plating is also used, because unlike copper and silver, it does not corrode. A thin oxidized layer of copper or silver would have a low conductivity, and so would cause large power losses as the majority of the current would still flow through this layer.|$|R
40|$|Active matter embraces {{systems that}} self-organize at {{different}} length and time scales, often exhibiting turbulent flows. Here, {{we use a}} quasi-two-dimensional nematically ordered layer of a protein-based active gel to experimentally demonstrate that the geometry of active flows, which we have characterized {{by means of the}} statistical distribution of eddy sizes, can be reversibly modified. To this purpose, the active material is prepared in contact with a thermotropic liquid crystal, whose lamellar smectic-A phase tiles the water/oil interface with a lattice of anisotropic domains that feature circular easy-flow directions. The active flow, which arises from the motion of parabolic folds within the filamentous active material, becomes effectively <b>confined</b> into circulating <b>eddies</b> that are in registry with the underlying smectic-A domains. Based on topological arguments applied to the circular confinement, together with well-known properties of the active material, we show that the structure of the active flow is determined by a single intrinsic length scale. The role of this length scale thus reemerges from setting the decay length in the exponential eddy size distribution of the free turbulent regime, to determining the minimum size of circulating eddies featuring a scale-free power law. Our results demonstrate that soft-confinement provides with an invaluable tool to probe the intrinsic length and time scales of active materials, and pave the way for further exploration looking for similarities and differences between active and passive two-dimensional turbulence.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} the stability of elliptical vortex in rotating stratified flows is completed in the present study. Firstly, we analyze the stability of a Lagrangian unsteady non-uniform vortices with a shorter wavelength WKB type formalism. It appears that the mechanism of destabilization of these eddies {{is the same as}} the one destabilizinga elliptical uniform vortex. This result shows that the elliptical instability is a universal 3 D mechanism of destabilization 2 D vortex. In a second time, is theoretically and experimentally studied the stability of elliptical <b>eddies</b> <b>confined</b> in a stratified fluid in rotation. The experimental device allowing the study consists of a rotating cylinder (filled with a stratified fluid in density following the vertical), elliptical distorted by two rolls fixed, all united by a panel also rotating. By varying the parameters of our experience (the frequency of Brunt-Väisälä Nb and the absolute vorticity Ta, the two quantities are non dimensional by the relative rate of rotation of fluid particles), we observed that the rotation and the stratification have antagonist contribution to the stability of elliptical vortices. Thus, if the stratification is sufficiently strong (Nb > 1), we observe that only anticyclones (such as |Ta| 1), nous observons que seuls les anticyclones (tels que |Ta| < 1) sont instables. Les cyclones étant toujours stables. Par ailleurs si la stratification est faible (Nb < 1), les zones d'instabilité s'inversent.

Firstly, one year-long (2014) real-time web monitoring of nonvelocity-based diagnostic parameters is conducted in order to infer both radar site status and HF radar system performance. Signal-to-noise ratio at the monopole exhibited a consistent monthly evolution although some abrupt decreases (below 10 dB), occasionally detected in June for one of the radar sites, impacted negatively on the spatiotemporal coverage of total current vectors. It seemed to be a sporadic episode since radar site overall performance was found to be robust during 2014. Secondly, a validation of HF radar data with independent in situ observations from a moored current meter was attempted for May–October 2014.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{temperature}} and freshwater fluxes by individual eddies in the North Atlantic between 40 degrees- 55 degrees N and 60 degrees- 10 degrees W for the period January 1993 to April 2014. Focus is on a zonal section along 47 degrees N, roughly at {{the boundary between the}} subpolar and the subtropical gyres. The main question is to what extent eddies are responsible for the variability and mixing in the region and how the anomalies of temperature and freshwater carried by eddies contribute to the overall fluxes across 47 degrees N. Almost 37000 eddies with a lifetime longer than one week are detected from surface geostrophic velocity fields derived from satellite-altimetry. First, only surface temperature fluxes based on collocating detected eddies with sea surface temperature observations from satellites are analyzed. The results are compared to two model simulations spanning the period from 2002 to 2013 with different horizontal resolution (1 / 4 degree and 1 / 12 degree), allowing {{to assess the impact of}} different resolution on the results. The analysis is then extended to three dimensional temperature and freshwater fluxes. The temperature and salinity fields used for the calculation of the fluxes stem from a new product that was derived from dynamic height using the Gravest Empirical Mode (GEM) technique. Using this new product allows for the first time to relate every detected eddy to profiles of temperature and freshwater and to analyze the respective fluxes across 47 degrees N. Since the 1 / 12 degree model configuration shows the more realistic results for the surface temperature fluxes, the comparison of the observed temperature and freshwater fluxes is confined to this configuration. The highest number of eddies is found along the pathway of the North Atlantic Current (NAC), roughly following the 4000 m isobath, and on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The typical vertical extent is around 1400 m, with anti-cyclonic eddies on average 200 m deeper than cyclonic eddies. Relating the observed eddies to the top-to-bottom velocity distribution from ship observations shows that the highest fluxes are linked to the fastest and most pronounced current branches in the western Newfoundland Basin. The time series of surface temperature fluxes by eddies crossing 47 degrees N reveal that single isolated eddies with large SST signatures contribute about 25 % to the surface temperature flux. Similarly, about 15 - 35 % of the three dimensional temperature and freshwater fluxes across 47 degrees N stem from eddies with large temperature and freshwater anomalies. The largest contribution to the flux by individual eddies stems from cold and fresh eddies originating from the Western Boundary Current moving northward with the NAC. While the fluxes by individual eddies are very small compared to the basin-wide integrated total fluxes, eddies induce a large part of the variability of the total flux. The effect of fluxes by individual <b>eddies</b> is regionally <b>confined,</b> but <b>eddies</b> contribute to the cooling of the NAC in the region around the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, to the local recirculation in the Newfoundland Basin, and in part to the interior southward pathway of subpolar water...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} and results from a new numerical model of Jupiter's atmosphere. The model is an adaptation of a general circulation model (GCM) of the Earth's atmosphere. It is a high resolution, limited-area model of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere of Jupiter, with realistic stratification and simple parametrizations of appropriate physical processes. We have used the model to study two areas of jovian atmospheric dynamics: firstly, mid-latitude vortices (exemplified by the Great Red Spot) and their interaction with baroclinic and barotropic jetstreams, and secondly, the properties of equatorial waves and their effect in driving a superrotating equatorial jet. Before describing the main GCM, we present a time-independent model of a balanced axisymmetric vortex. The model performs a potential vorticity inversion, predicting the vertical variation of winds and temperatures required for balance, given a specified PV anomaly. We show that both shallow <b>eddies</b> (<b>confined</b> above about 20 bars) and deep ones (extending barotropically below 100 bars) could theoretically exist. The two types would be almost indistinguishable if observed only above the cloud-tops, i. e. at pressures p â¤ 300 mb. We then describe the primitive-equation GCM, concentrating on the modifications necessary to represent Jupiter. In order to run the GCM, basic-state temperature and zonal wind profiles must be chosen, for these are not adequately constrained by observations. Numerical solution of the vertical structure equation allows the calculation of the eigenmodes of any atmosphere, thus predicting the approximate vertical structure of Rossby waves. This simplified 1 D analysis gives an insight into suitable initial profiles {{and the results of}} the full model. The first GCM experiments examine midlatitude vortices {{in the absence of a}} background flow. Anticyclonic vortices migrate equatorward, while shrinking and intensifying by a process akin to frontogenesis. After intensifying, some eddies become unstable and disintegrate, generating daughter eddies. All eddies seem to adjust their vertical structure toward the first baroclinic normal mode. When eddies are placed in an enviroment of latitudinally alternating zonal jetstreams, meridional migration is blocked by the jets. However, most eddies intensify until they overcome the barrier presented by the jet. Mixed baroclinic/barotropic instability in the jets can generate eddies of either shallow or deep structure, echoing the results of the PV inversion model. Moving on to equatorial dynamics, we analyse the properties of equatorial waves on Jupiter, and their interaction with the zonal mean flow. We find that mean-flow acceleration by dissipation of upward propagating Kelvin waves can (in principle) quantitatively account for the observed superrotating equatorial jet. By considering the effect of a range of possible wave sources below the clouds, we find that the troposphere filters waves primarily by their phase speed, suggesting that the speed and shape of the jet may be less sensitive to the source than to the basic atmospheric stratification. We propose a mechanism of Kelvin-wave forcing, plus weak zonally symmetric solar heating to account for the observed velocity and meridional structure of the equatorial jet. The vertical structure is less realistic, with an underlying easterly jet, but this may be because our sources are insufficiently deep in the atmosphere. </p...|$|R
