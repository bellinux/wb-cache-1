40|$|Maintenance is the {{combination}} of all technical and associated administrative actions intended to retain an item in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform its required function. Companies are seeking to gain competitive advantage with respect to cost, quality, service and on time deliveries. The effect of maintenance on these variables has prompted increased attention to the maintenance areas {{as an integral part}} of productivity improvement. Due to numerous advantages of maintenance, manufacturing companies are trying to adopt maintenance strategies to support their businesses. The purpose of this study is to analyze maintenance strategies found in local manufacturing companies. In this paper we report on our findings on how maintenance strategy has improved company operations and performance. The paper is based on maintenance strategy theoretical overview and multiple case studies in which six companies were studied. The paper evaluates their views on the strategic impact of production maintenance. From literature two important elements of maintenance strategy that were focused on are structural and infrastructure decisions. A benchmarking process was also done on maintenance performance factors. A questionnaire that incorporated structural, infrastructural and maintenance performance factors was circulated in the studied companies. The research established that most employees now understand maintenance policies and concepts. An increase in in-house maintenance was observed, with improved overall equipment effectiveness. Improved spares availability was also noticed. The study noticed that equipment modifications was still lacking in most companies. Most maintenance personnel had no access to the <b>computerized</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems,</b> impacting negatively on their maintenance planning and control.

Globally, maintenance is a very important activity in the manufacturing sector to prolong the life span of equipment and machinery; it is also applicable to all household items. It is obvious and well known that apart from giving long life to equipment, it reduces the substantial financial losses for repairs and save the production downtime. In some cases, appropriate maintenance of plant equipment and machinery reduces the tendencies of injuries to personnel in the job floor. But before the maintenance process can be carried out, proper and effective work order planning and scheduling must be in place in other to achieve the set goals and objectives of a maintenance shop.

Waste elimination, in particular the reduction of work in process and overproduction, required by Lean Manufacturing methodology that has spread across industries, highlights and also increases the impact of failures or malfunctions of equipment on productivity. Managing maintenance involves several activities such as: planning of preventive maintenance actions; scheduling of activities considering available resources and planned production; management of spare parts; analysis of data to reduce the occurrence of failures and to improve performance of the maintenance function. To support this function, companies adopt information <b>systems</b> designated by <b>computerized</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> (CMMS) to provide timely and accurate information.
