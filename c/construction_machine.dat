50|$|The {{cause of}} the leak {{has not yet been}} ascertained. After the explosion, signs of damage by a <b>construction</b> <b>machine</b> were {{discovered}} on the exploded part of the pipeline and the adjacent parts.

50|$|The ASSCM is a {{civilian}} unmanned ground vehicle developed in Yuzuncu Yil University by scientific project granted by TUBITAK (Project code 110M396). The vehicle {{is a low}} cost small scale <b>construction</b> <b>machine</b> which can grade soft soil. The machine is capable of autonomously grading the earth within a polygon once {{the border of the}} polygon is defined. The machine determines its position by CP-DGPS and direction by consecutive position measurements. Currently the machine can autonomously grade simple polygons. The autonomous grading algorithm and control system of the machine is developed.|$|E

Eventually, in 2006, thirteen episodes were released straight to DVD as a collection called On Site with Thomas.|$|E
50|$|The project officially got {{underway}} in August 2015. With {{the help of}} a New Track <b>Construction</b> <b>machine,</b> workers officially laid the second track between Ronkonkoma and Central Islip within a year, with some work still to be done. There were a few weekends with no service, and in addition, a few grade crossings were closed for two days to add the second track to the crossings. A design-build contract for phase 2 was awarded in June 2016. In August 2016, workers started to clear brush and make space for Phase 2 east of Deer Park near Wyandanch.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, Oconomowoc {{acquired}} Pabst Farms {{from the}} Town of Summit. Pabst Farms, which {{had previously been}} owned by the Pabst family, is being developed as a mixture of commercial and residential property.

50|$|In {{the time}} from 1957 to 1958, a special {{department}} for industrial and <b>construction</b> <b>machines</b> was set up.

50|$|In 1845, Justus Christian Braun {{founded a}} foundry in Nuremberg that {{merged with the}} Ansbach vehicle factory in 1918. The Fahrzeugfabriken Ansbach und Nürnberg {{factories}} of Ansbach and Nuremberg, in short Faun, were formed in this way. In 1986, the owners at the time, the Schmidt family, sold the company to the <b>construction</b> <b>machine</b> manufacturer Orenstein & Koppel. The municipal vehicle department was detached and continued as a company of the Kirchhoff Group with the plant in Osterholz-Scharmbeck running {{under the name of}} Faun Umwelttechnik environment technology. In 1990 the remaining part of the company was acquired by Japanese mobile crane manufacturer Tadano Ltd. Since then, the Faun GmbH has represented the manufacturing company and the Tadano Faun GmbH the sales company. In 2012, both companies merged to form the single company of Tadano Faun GmbH.|$|E
5000|$|A grader, also {{commonly}} referred to as a road grader or a motor grader, is a <b>construction</b> <b>machine</b> with a long blade used to create a flat surface during the grading process. Typical models have three axles, with the engine and cab situated above the rear axles {{at one end of the}} vehicle and a third axle at the front end of the vehicle, with the blade in between. In certain countries, for example in Finland, almost every grader is equipped with a second blade that is placed in front of the front axle. Some construction personnel refer to the entire machine as [...] "the blade". Capacities range from a blade width of 2.50 to 7.30 m and engines from 93-373 kW (125-500 hp). Certain graders can operate multiple attachments, or be used for separate tasks like underground mining.|$|E
50|$|The PLA {{contributed to}} {{economic}} development in two additional ways. First, in November 1984 the government decided to transfer some military facilities to civilian control or joint military-civilian use. These facilities included airfields, ports, docks, railroads, depots and warehouses, and recreational areas. The devolution of these facilities to civilian control helped to alleviate problems that plagued the civilian economy. Second, {{beginning in the late}} 1970s, the PLA operated a large-scale program of dual-use training, whereby PLA personnel learned skills useful to the growing economy. Under this program, officers and soldiers received military training and training in specialized skills, such as livestock breeding, cultivation, processing, <b>construction,</b> <b>machine</b> maintenance, repair of domestic appliances, motor vehicle repair, and driving. In 1986 the PLA trained more than 650,000 soldiers in 25,000 training courses at over 6,000 training centers. In early 1987 surveys indicated that over 70 percent of demobilized PLA personnel left the armed forces with skills they could use as civilians.|$|E

50|$|Continuous tracks such {{as those}} used on {{military}} tanks or <b>construction</b> <b>machines</b> (i.e. caterpillar tracks) have metal track segments which may be rubber-coated. They usually do not feature tread patterns, because these would offer little additional grip given {{the weight of the}} tracked vehicle. Traction is usually provided by grousers instead.|$|R
