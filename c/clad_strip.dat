40|$|Purpose: Of {{this paper}} is to realize the casting of the <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> by only one process. Therefore, the {{investigation}} of the ability of the casting of the <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> by a vertical type twin roll caster was operated. The aim of the use of the twin roll caster to make <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> was in the reduction of the production-energy of the <b>clad</b> <b>strip.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Used {{in the present study was}} a vertical type twin roll caster with the scriber. The scriber was used to prevent the mixture of the two kinds of the melts. The scriber was set at roll-bite, and the scriber contacted to the one of solidification layer. The melt was stopped by the scriber and the only the solidification layer was dragged by the roll. Findings: The <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> with the clear interface could be by the vertical type twin roll caster with the scriber. The scriber was useful to drag only the solid and semisolid layer. The two kinds of strips were connected strictly at the interface of the <b>clad</b> <b>strip.</b> The <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> was not broken at the interface by the continuous bending. Research limitations/implications: Are that 100 mm width-strip was cast in the present study. Ability of the <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> that is wider than 100 mm was not clear.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to show the {{characteristics}} of two kinds of roll casters for three-layer <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> of aluminium alloys. Moreover, the characteristics of these twin roll casters were compeered with the early type of roll casters for <b>clad</b> <b>strip.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Design was tried to attain the fabrication of the roll casters to cast the three-layers-clad-strip. One caster was an unequal diameter roll caster equipped with a scraper. The scraper was adopted to prevent the mixture of different kinds of melts of the alloys. The scraper was used to cast the <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> with clear interfaces between each strip. The other caster was a tandem type roll caster assembled from two vertical type twin roll casters. A vertical type of twin roll was mounted on the other vertical type of a twin roll caster. Findings: Three layers of clad strips could be cast by two kinds of the roll casters developed in the present study. The casting speed was 20 m/min. This speed was much higher at the conventional twin roll caster for the aluminium alloys. Each strip of three layers <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> was connected strictly. The element of <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> did not peel at the interface by continuous bending. The as-cast <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> could be cold-rolled. The element of alloys did not mix at the connecting interface of the strips. The casting conditions which affected the connecting of the strips and condition of interface were investigated and shown in this paper. Research limitations/implications: The width of the strip was from 30 mm to 50 mm. The casting of the wide strip was not investigated. The alloy used in the present study was only aluminium alloys. The length of the cast strip was 3 m. The thickness of element strip was from 0. 8 mm to 1. 5 mm. The difference of the melting temperature of the alloys was within 50 °C. The number of the layers was less than three layers. Practical implications: The roll caster invented in the present study can be used for the fabrication of the <b>clad</b> <b>strip.</b> The <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> is, for example, used for the brazing sheet of the radiator for the automotive industry. Originality/value: There was not a report concerning the roll caster for three layers <b>clad</b> <b>strip.</b> The roll casters for clad strips shown in this paper were of an original process.

40|$|Purpose: of this paper: Twin roll casters {{that can}} cast two layers and three layers <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> of {{aluminium}} alloys were invented. One {{of the purposes of}} this paper is to report that the two layers and three layers <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> could be cast by the twin roll caster of this study. The investigation of the characters of these casters and the clad strips was purpose of this paper, too. The connecting at the interface between the strips was most important in the casting of the <b>clad</b> <b>strip.</b> Therefore, the attention was paid on the conditions of the interface. Design/methodology/approach: A vertical type tandem twin roll caster and a twin roll caster equipped with a scraper were designed, assembled and tested. Castings of the two layers <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> and the three layers <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> directly from molten metal were tried using these twin roll casters. The connecting strength between strips was investigated by the continuous bending test and the cold rolling. The diffusion and re-melting at the interface was investigated by the SEM-EPMA. Findings: The twin roll casters invented in this study could cast the two layers and three layers clad strips directly from molten metal. These clad strips had clear interface between the strips. This means that the mixing of the two alloys did not occur at the interface. The diffusion of elements of the each strip into another strip did not occur at the interface. The connecting strength was enough to endure the peeling at the interface by continuous bending. The clad ratio could be controlled by the solidification length up to 10 : 1. Two layers <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> assembled from Al-Mg alloy strip and another aluminium alloy strip could be cast without defect by the effect of the scraper. The three layers <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> which base strip had lower melting point than that of the overlay strip could be cast. Practical implications: The three layers <b>clad</b> <b>strip,</b> which base strip is 3003 aluminium alloy and overlay strips are 4045 aluminium alloy, can be used for the brazing sheet of the radiator of the automobile. The twin roll caster of this paper could cast this type of <b>clad</b> <b>strip.</b> The process saving and the energy saving can be attain by the twin roll caster of this paper.

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is to show the {{development}} of a twin roll caster for aluminium alloy. One of the developments was the increase of the roll speed. The increase of the roll speed was essential to improve the low productivity of the twin roll caster. Limitation of the alloys, which can be cast into the strip, could be enlarged by the method to increase the roll speed. The method to increase the roll speed was useful to increase the cooling rate of the cast strip. The devices to increase the roll speed were shown in this paper. Other development was invention of the twin roll caster to cast <b>clad</b> <b>strip.</b> The twin roll casters to cast two layers <b>clad</b> <b>strip,</b> three layers <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> and five layers <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> were invented. Design/methodology/approach: Increase of roll speed was attained by the use of a copper roll and a nozzle, operation of the low temperature casting and non-use of parting material. A scraper was adopted to the twin roll caster for <b>clad</b> <b>strip</b> to prevent the mixture of the molten metals and to control the surface condition. The devices to increase the roll speed were useful for the roll caster to cast <b>clad</b> <b>strip.</b> Findings: The aluminium alloy strip could be cast at the speeds up to 90 m/min. The aluminium alloy which has wide freezing zone like Al- 25 %Si could be cast into the strip. Two layers, three layers and five layers of clad strips could be cast. Research limitations/implications: The roll casters were laboratory size. Therefore, it was not clear of the ability of the casting of the long size and wide size strips. Practical implications: The productivity of aluminium alloy strip is increased. The property of the aluminium alloy strip is improved. The aluminium alloy, which was too brittle to be formed into the plate, will be cast into strip directly from melt. The process and energy to make the brazing sheet will be saved by the roll caster of the present study. Originality/value: The invented roll casters, devices for casting and properties of the cast strips are original...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} the technical development {{for a patent}} disclosure of a double-clad process for the continuous casting of thin-strip carbon steel. The fundamental idea of the disclosure is to form a product strip by depositing molten steel between two, cooled, clad strips of the same material. The claimed benefits include: (a) the conservation of energy in steel making through the elimination of soaking pits and reheat cycles, and (b) an improved surface {{on both sides of}} the as-cast product such that it will be suitable for direct feed to a cold-reduction mill. However, the process as conceived is not necessarily limited to the casting of carbon steel, but may be also applied to other metals and alloys. The work is described under three headings as follows. Preliminary Considerations and Scoping Analysis presents the basic idea of the double-clad, thin-strip casting process; the energy conservation potential; scoping heat transfer calculations for the casting process; and independent review of this work. Thermal Analysis for Roller Configuration of Double-Clad Process, presents the development, results, and independent review of a finite-element thermal analysis for the casting process as originally conceived (using only chilled rollers in direct contact with the clad material of the product strip).

40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to present and to {{demonstrate}} a novel approach for the fabrication of micro-structured fiber Bragg gratings (MSFBGs) to be employed as technological platform for advanced optochemical sensors.

While its spectral features for sensing and communication applications have been widely described and commented elsewhere, here a simple fabrication procedure is presented as suitable technological assessment enabling cost effective and simple MSFBG production. It relies on a two steps technique based on arcdischarge procedure as fiber pre-treatment and mask-less wet chemical etching to locally sensitize the FBG to external refractive index.

40|$|This {{work has}} been devoted to present and {{demonstrate}} a novel approach for the fabrication of micro-structured fiber Bragg gratings (MSFBGs) with enhanced control of the geometric features and thus of the spectral properties of the final device. The investigated structure relies on the localized <b>stripping</b> of the <b>cladding</b> layer in a well defined region {{in the middle of the}} grating structure leading to the formation of a defect state in the spectral response. In order to fully explore the versatility of MSFBGs for sensing and communications applications, a technological assessment of the fabrication process aimed to provide high control of the geometrical features is required. To this aim, here, we demonstrate that the optimization of this device is possible by adopting a fabrication process based on polymeric coatings patterned by high resolution UV laser micromachining tools. The function of the polymeric coating is to act as mask for the HF based chemical etching process responsible for the <b>cladding</b> <b>stripping.</b> Whereas, UV laser micromachining provides a valuable method to accurately pattern the polymeric coating and thus obtain a selective stripping along the grating structure. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the potentiality of the proposed approach to realize reliable and cost efficient MSFBGs enabling the prototyping of advanced photonics devices based on this technology...|$|R
40|$|Asymmetrical {{and lower}} heat {{transport}} {{caused by the}} <b>cladding</b> <b>strip</b> during twin-roll casting (TRC) of clad sheet makes the process window narrow compared with traditional TRC. The effect of pouring temperature on process stability is more remarkable when it is relatively high under high casting speed and casting speed becomes a leading factor when its value is low. The inter-diffusion zone width at the Al/Fe interface depends on the solid/semi-solid contacting time. The longer the time is, the wider the inter-diffusion zone. A widest zone of 3. 8 μm is attained under condition of casting speed of 1. 25 m/min and pouring temperature of 720 °C. Bonding strength of clad sheet by TRC depends on inter-diffusion zone width and rolling reduction. Proper combinations of inter-diffusion zone width and rolling reduction can result in same high bonding strength. The highest bonding strength of 16 N/mm is attained under a combination of rolling reduction of 29 % and inter-diffusion zone of 3. 7 μm. The wetting of aluminum melt on steel surface is uneven and insufficient {{as a result of}} short contacting time in TRC. As a result, same rolling reduction in TRC induces lower bonding strength than in roll bonding process. Bonding strength of clad sheet by TRC decreases when the surface of the steel strip is brushed, as a result of decrement of actual contacting area...|$|R

An optional rear lift glass (first introduced with the 1995 Orvis edition where production tailgates manufactured after January 3, 1995 have both provisions for both fixed and lift glass) for the Laredo and Limited were added to the options list (the fixed glass came standard). The base SE model was dropped for 1996, in favor of new features being added to the Laredo (now base) model. The Grand Cherokee now offered standard power windows, power door locks, rear door child locks, cool blasting, keyless entry, A/M-F/M radio with cassette player and compact disc player and four standard speakers, cloth seating surfaces, and more. The manual transmission was no longer offered after the 1994 model year Grand Cherokee sold in North America but remained as the base transmission for European ZJs (ZG) sold in Europe with the diesel motor. New front door designs got new side body <b>cladding</b> <b>strips,</b> and the 'Laredo' subtext on the Laredo model was moved down to the cladding. The 'Grand Cherokee' badge was relocated to the front lower doors, and was now larger (using a font style similar to other Chrysler products), replacing the 1974-era American Motors font style used on Jeep vehicles. On V8-equipped Grand Cherokees, there was a new V8 badge on the rear liftgate. The 4X4 badge, on four-wheel-drive-equipped Grand Cherokees, was also changed to raised metal letters instead of the 4X4 decals offered before. A combination cassette player and CD player was available for the first time as an option, and the vehicle featured an OBD II diagnostics port under the dashboard on the driver's side, required for all 1996 model year and newer vehicles, a digital odometer and trip odometer, a 120 miles per hour speedometer rating on some models, and the vehicle now included some user-programmable features such as if the headlamps and tail lamps flashed when a button was pressed on the keyless entry remote, how many miles until service intervals, whether the horn sounded when a button was pressed on the keyless entry remote, and more. The overhead console was somewhat redesigned for the 1996 model year to improve storage space and feature availability. In addition to the cigarette lighter port, a 12-volt power port was added for cellular telephones, coolers, computers, and other devices. The ashtray was also removed from the rear doors, replaced by a solid area. The Limited model and Orvis Edition model both got chrome interior door handles.|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} analysis of an in-fiber photonic device based on multidefect micro-structured fiber Bragg gratings (MSFBGs) as in fiber refractometer. The investigated structure consists in a fiber Bragg grating where the <b>cladding</b> layer is <b>stripped</b> in different and well defined regions along the grating length. The presence of the thinned regions induces more defect states inside the spectral band-gap of the original device. The mechanism is ruled by multiple interactions of the spectra reflected by the unperturbed grating regions modulated by the phase shifts introduced by the thinned regions. The key feature of the proposed structure is the strong dependence of the defect states on the surrounding refractive indices (SRIs) in the thinned regions, leading to the possibility to realize attractive passive and active photonics devices. Here, the attention {{has been focused on}} the feasibility to use a dual defect MSFBG for multiple refractive index measurements. Numerical results reveal that by a proper choice of the thinned regions lengths, it is possible to perform multipoint measurements by a single device. © 2006 Optical Society of America...|$|R
40|$|Commissioned by {{a unique}} {{partnership}} between Leeds Metropolitan University and Yorkshire County Cricket Club, Alsop Architects, of which I was Principal, was challenged to deliver an innovative design providing world-class media and players' facilities, and hospitality and teaching facilities, all {{under one roof}} {{in the creation of}} a building that would operate as a university teaching facility during the academic year. It is at one and the same time a university faculty and professional sports facility. The project posed particular challenges concerning its urban site, technical performance requirements, and environmental needs, each of which were resolved through research-led development and design. On the north and west façade, the rainscreen cladding, with its varied perforations, pitches and tones, visually breaks down the mass of the building, reflecting the light from a variety of angles. The naturalistic green cladding intentionally merges with the soft landscaping in front of the Pavilion as well as the existing mature trees along Kirkstall Lane and the surrounding neighbourhood. The three-dimensional rainscreen façade is formed from discrete flat panels <b>clad</b> with regular <b>strips</b> of perforated, powder-coated aluminium, supported on a triangular metal subframe, spanning from floor slab to floor slab. It is itself punctuated by an irregular pattern of triangular windows. Co-occupation of the building – with over 70...|$|R
50|$|The open {{living room}} is planned around a {{rectilinear}} structural grid whose dimensions are adjusted to suit the disposition of rooms above. This {{is in contrast to}} the conventional Modernist practice exemplified by the work of Le Corbusier by comparison with the sophisticated spatial composition of the ground floor. Aalto varies the dimensions of the structural grid in both directions, and the circular steel columns are randomly placed; in one case, they are tripped <b>clad</b> with wooden <b>strips</b> or bound with rattan, and in the library, one of the three columns in arbitrarily changed to concrete (early sketches also show it as free-form in plan). Aalto is at such pains to subvert any clear geometric reading of the structural and spatial organization that it comes as something of a discovery that the whole plan is in fact regulated by a series of squares. This is in contrast to Mies van der Rohe, by whom the structural grid was conceived as a regular counterpoint to the independent spatial disposition of the ‘free plan’.Although this geometry contributes to the formal discipline which underpins the episodic spatial composition, and is emblematic of an ‘ideal’ house, {{it is only in the}} dining room that one can directly sense the underlying order.|$|R
40|$|AISI 316 L {{stainless}} steel was surface-modified with NiTi using three different methods: (1) laser surface alloying using NiTi powder (LSA-NiTi-powder), (2) laser <b>cladding</b> using NiTi <b>strips</b> (LC-NiTi-strip), and (3) microwave-assisted brazing using NiTi plates (MB-NiTi-plate). These methods {{are capable of}} bringing significant improvement in the cavitation erosion resistance as reported elsewhere. The present work aims at studying the corrosion behaviors of these surface-modified {{stainless steel}} samples in 3. 5 % NaCl solution. Cyclic polarization tests reveal that the pitting potentials of the laser-treated samples are {{comparable to that of}} the AISI 316 L substrate, but the protection potentials and the corrosion potentials are somewhat lower. On the other hand, the corrosion behavior of the brazed sample {{is similar to that of}} as-received NiTi, which does not show pitting up to potentials exceeding 1500 mV. Galvanic tests of couples with AISI 316 L as one member and the surface-modified sample as the other member show only a small galvanic current density in all the three cases. The ratio of the average galvanic current density to the corrosion current density of the uncoupled anodic member is small (not exceeding 4 in all cases), indicating good compatibility when these techniques are used in local surface modification of AISI 316 L substrate. © 2005 Elsevier B.

H 577 P EIE 2016 Tsangx, 109 pages :color illustrationsThe thesis {{entitled}} "Design and Analysis of High Power Laser Systems", aims {{to study}} how to design, develop and analysis compact, reliable, efficient, and cost-effective high power fiber lasers. Different from other kinds of laser, fiber lasers can provide a very small beam spot and the beam diameter can be only a few several microns. Therefore, these fiber lasers {{can be used in}} different areas especially in industrial applications such as telecommunication, laser marking, laser cutting, optical sensing, etc. In telecommunication industry, new optical fiber networks such as CATV systems with passive optical network (PON) are commonly deployed. As a result, single mode fibers carrying several watts of optical power is used instead of multimode fibers. High power lasers can be achieved by using high power EDFAs. New technologies including double cladded fibers (DCFs), and pump combiner are used. Besides passive components, practical skills such as cladding pumping, and <b>cladding</b> mode <b>stripping</b> will be discussed. We will consider both continuous wave (CW) as well as pulse lasers. Pulse lasers by using waveguide ring resonators in passive mode-locking would also be analyzed. Use of ring resonator is a modern technology to build ultrashort pulse lasers. The pulse lasers can be used in high fiber laser systems as seed laser. The thesis is divided into three parts. Chapter 1 introduces the laser mechanism. Studies of the structures and characteristics of lasers including single frequency operation, narrow linewidth, and measurement of laser noise are also included. A narrow linewidth 1064 nm fiber laser which can work in spectroscopy is introduced. In Chapter 2, we discussed high power fiber amplifiers, including the designs, constructions, operations, and limitations of high power fiber amplifiers. Wideband fiber amplifier in 1 m range is report. The amplifier can work with the fiber laser mentioned in Chapter 1 in order to provide a high output power. Also, demonstration in LiDAR sensing application is given. Chapter 3 discussed pulse lasers, including advanced passive mode-locking by using waveguide ring resonators. Stabilizing of mode-locked laser is demonstrated. Also, 2 m range mode-locked laser by using mircoring resonator is reported. The progress as well as further development is given on Chapter 4.

40|$|Hypermonotectic AlPb and AlBi alloys are {{considered}} as exceptionally qualified bearing materials being required for advanced car engines. But {{based on the}} considerable differences in {{the density of the}} decomposed fluid phases at high temperatures and the high velocity of the gravity forced phase separation, such alloys could not, to date, be manufactured under terrestrial conditions. The results of microgravity experiments for the manufacturing of suitable sample material with a fine dispersion of the monotectic phases were, however, quite surprising and at least disappointing. The reasons of rapid phase separation and local enrichment under microgravity conditions became clear by intensive experimental and theoretical research elucidating the effect of the Marangoni convection. These results of the space experiments are now utilized in a terrestrial casting process, whereby a comparatively high Marangoni convection is superposed in the opposite direction to the sedimentation action of gravity, thereby partially compensating the effects of gravity. Thus cast strips of AlSiPb and AlSiBi alloys could be manufactured, the Pb and Bi phases being present in a characteristic fine dispersion over the length of the cast strip. In addition, the processing of these new materials by rolling and <b>cladding</b> with steel <b>strip</b> has been established, in order to produce bearing. Results of tribological tests of these alloys give an indication of their superior behavior under the most critical conditions of mixed lubrication e. g. embeddability, running-in characteristics and wear resistance.

5000|$|Third {{generation}} {{models were}} sold as the Plymouth Voyager, Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country. The Caravan and Voyager {{were available in}} either 3 or 4 door configurations on either a standard model or an extended wheelbase model known as the Grand Voyager and Grand Caravan, respectively. The Town & Country was only available in a long wheelbase configuration, with either 3 or 4 doors. Caravan trim levels were largely carried over from the previous generation, offered in Base, SE, and {{top of the line}} ES models, while a Sport package was available on short wheelbase SE models. Caravan ES models came with more options than before, featuring a standard Infinity sound system, a power driver's seat, dual-zone climate control, deluxe cloth seating (leather was optional) and alloy wheels, among other features. As part of Chrysler's new corporate strategy to better focus the Plymouth brand on entry-level vehicles, Voyagers and were only available in base trim and better-equipped SE models, although a high end LE trim which was largely a clone of the Caravan ES was available in Canada. A Rallye option package continued to be available on SE model, being the de facto top of the line Voyager. It was renamed [...] "Expresso" [...] for 1998. The Town & Country was now available in two different trims, the LX and LXi. On the Voyager and Caravan, the trims were easily distinguished by their body-side moldings. Base models used a narrow accent color strip and SE models used a wide accent color strip, with Voyager SEs with the Rallye package receiving [...] "Rallye" [...] badges on the front doors. Caravan ES and Voyager LEs used the base model's narrow accent color molding combined with a full accent color effect on the lower portion of the doors. The vinyl woodgrain-appearance side paneling was no longer available, as the new side sheetmetal was no longer flat. Early Plymouth Voyagers had a Pentastar front logo and rear badges using the same font as the Caravan, which was changed to Plymouth's new [...] "sailboat" [...] logo and script font on the badges by calendar year 1996. Voyagers and Caravans were only differentiated by their grilles, and some wheel options, while The Town & Country received plastic lower side <b>cladding</b> with chrome <b>strips,</b> unique wheels and a chrome waterfall grille with the Chrysler brand's new ribbon logo. Unique features for the Town & Country included as pre-programmed driver's seat and mirror, standard leather interior, 8-way power adjustable front seats, Infinity sound system with cassette/CD player. As with previous generations, the NS minivan was exported as the Chrysler Voyager, which was a Dodge Caravan modified to meet European safety and lighting standards, while for the 2000 model year it received the Plymouth Voyager's front fascia.In 1997, the Town & Country received standard dual sliding doors and a short wheelbase SX model (not available in Canada), and in 1998 it received a new front fascia, headlamps and wheels. Also in 1998, the Caravan SE dropped, replaced with a new [...] "Sport" [...] model that came with a completely color keyed body, rear spoiler and new wheels, and the Plymouth Voyager Rallye was renamed Expresso, while all models got grocery bag hooks installed on the rear seats. In 1999, the Caravan received standard dual sliding doors, as well as new front fascias, the ES model received revised trim, the [...] "AutoStick" [...] transmission and 17 inch wheels. With the discontinuation of the Plymouth brand, Voyagers produced late in the 2000 model year became Chrysler Voyagers, though they didn't receive any of the trim or options of the European export model.|$|R
