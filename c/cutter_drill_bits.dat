50|$|Most {{rolling cutter}} and fixed <b>cutter</b> <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> have {{internal}} passages to direct drilling fluid, conveyed by the drill pipe from surface pumps, through hydraulic nozzles {{directed at the}} bottom of the wellbore to produce high velocity fluid jets that assist in cleaning the old cuttings off the bottom before the next tooth contacts the rock. Placement of the nozzles, particularly in rolling cutter bits, is also often done to assist in keeping the cutting elements free of cuttings build-up in certain kinds of clay and shale formations.|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the investigation of the}} feasibility of rapid drilling in ice sheets and glaciers to depths of up to 600 m, with cuttings and cores continually transported by air reverse circulation. The method employs dual wall drill rods. The inner tubes provide a continuous pathway for the chips and cores from the drill bit face to the surface. To modify air reverse circulation drilling technology according to the conditions of a specific glacier, original <b>cutter</b> <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> and air processing devices (air-cooled aftercoolers, air receivers, coalescing filters, desiccant dryers) should be used. The airflow velocity for conveying a 60 -mm diameter and 200 -mm long ice core should not be lower than 22. 5 m/s, and the minimal airflow rate for continual chip and cores transport is 6. 8 m 3 /min at 2. 3 – 2. 6 MPa. Drilling of a 600 -m deep hole can be accomplished within 1. 5 days in the case of 24 h drilling operations. However, to avoid sticking while drilling through ice, the drilling depth should to be limited to 540 m at a temperature of − 20 °C and to 418 m at a temperature of − 10 °C. この論文では、氷床や氷河の深度 600 mまでの氷コア掘削について、空気を循環して送ることで氷の切削と氷コアの輸送を連続的に行う高速掘削の実行可能性について述べている。この方法は、二重のチューブにしたドリルロッドを使うことで可能である。二重ドリルロッドの内側チューブは、ドリルの切削面から地上までの切削チップおよび氷コアの輸送経路となる。様々な氷河の状況によって空気循環掘削技術を適応するために、それに対応するドリルロッドのカッターと空気処理装置（乾燥した冷たい空気を送るための、空冷クーラー、空気貯留タンク、空気乾燥機など）を使用する必要がある。直径 60 mm、長さ 200 mmの氷コアを運ぶための空気速度は 22. 5 m/s以上でなければならず、連続的な切削チップおよび氷コア輸送のための最小空気流量は 2. 3 〜 2. 6 MPaの時に 6. 8 m 3 /分になる。 24 時間の掘削作業の場合には、 600 mの深さの孔を 1. 5 日以内に掘削することが可能である。しかし、氷河や氷床の掘削中にスタックするのを避けるためには、掘削深度を− 20 ℃の氷温では 540 mに、− 10 ℃の氷温では 418 mに制限する必要がある...|$|E

40|$|The work {{reported}} herein is {{a continuation}} of the program initiated under DOE contract E(10 - 1) - 1546 * entitled "Program to Design and Experimentally Test an Improved Geothermal Bit"; the program is now DOE Contract EG- 76 -C- 1546 *. The objective of the program has been to accelerate the commercial availability of a tolling <b>cutter</b> <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> for geothermal applications. Data and experimental tests needed to develop a bit suited to the harsh thermal, abrasive, and chemical environment of the more problematic geothermal wells, including those drilled with air, have been obtained. Efforts were directed at the improvement of both the sealed (lubricated) and unsealed types of bits. The unsealed bit effort included determination of the rationale for materials selection, the selection of steels for the bit body, cutters, and bearings, the selection of tungsten carbide alloys for the friction bearing, and preliminary investigation of optimized tungsten carbide <b>drilling</b> inserts. <b>Bits</b> build** with the new materials were tested under stimulated wellbore conditions. The sealed bit effort provided for the evaluation of candidate high temperature seals and lubricants, utilizing two specially developed test apparatus which simulate the conditions found in a sealed bit operating in a geothermal wellbore. Phase I of the program was devoted largely to (1) the study of the geothermal environment and the failure mechanisms of existing geothermal <b>drill</b> <b>bits,</b> (2) the design and construction of separate facilities for testing both drill-bit seals and full-scale <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> under simulated geothermal drilling conditions, and (3) fabrication of the MK-I research <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> from high-temperature steels, and testing in the geothermal drill-bit test facility. The work accomplished in Phase I is reported in References 1 through 9. In Phase II, the first generation experimental bits were tested in the geothermal drill-bit test facility. Test results indicated that hardness retention at temperature, but not at the expense of fracture toughness, was a primary requirement for geothermal bit bearings. Materials selections for the MK-II bit were made based on these results. Also in Phase II, effort was directed at the screening of elastomers for use as a high-temperature seal for sealed bits. References 10 though 13 report the work performed in Phase II. This report summarizes the work on Phase III, encompassing the period from May 18, 1977, to May 19, 1978. There were two major tasks in Phase III which consisted of material selection, fabrication and testing of MK-III bits and Seal and lubricant evaluation. [DJE - 2005...|$|R
40|$|The {{manufacture}} of thermally stable diamond (TSP) <b>cutters</b> for <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> used in petroleum drilling requires the brazing of two dissimilar materials [...] TSP diamond and tungsten carbide. The ENDURUS{trademark} thermally stable diamond cutter developed by Technology International, Inc. exhibits (1) high attachment (shear) strength, exceeding 345 MPa (50, 000 psi), (2) TSP diamond impact strength increased by 36 %, (3) prevents TSP fracture when drilling hard rock, and (4) maintains a sharp edge when drilling hard and abrasive rock. A novel microwave brazing (MWB) method for joining dissimilar materials has been developed. A conventional {{braze filler metal}} is combined with microwave heating which minimizes thermal residual stress between materials with dissimilar coefficients of thermal expansion. The process results in preferential heating of the lower thermal expansion diamond material, thus providing the ability to match the thermal expansion of the dissimilar material pair. Methods for brazing with both conventional and exothermic braze filler metals have been developed. Finite element modeling (FEM) assisted in the fabrication of TSP cutters controllable thermal residual stress and high shear attachment strength. Further, a unique cutter design for absorbing shock, the densification of otherwise porous TSP diamond for increased mechanical strength, and diamond ion implantation for increased diamond fracture resistance resulted in successful <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> tests...|$|R
40|$|Boeing South Carolina {{builds the}} Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the world's first composite-skinned {{wide-body}} jet. This new manufacturing facility is evolving {{to meet the}} demands of building this complex aircraft. One of the challenges faced by this site is providing the manufacturing workforce with the best tools for the job in an efficient manner. Two different research streams investigate this high-level problem. First is a technical investigation into the selection of a <b>cutter</b> (<b>drill</b> <b>bit)</b> for use in drilling Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) and titanium stacks found in the door surrounds of the aircraft. It was found that a double margin tungsten carbide (WC) cutter with a 1350 point angle and double margin design had superior cost and quality performance as compared to a 1180 point angle polycrystalline diamond (PCD) cutter with a single margin design that was previously used. For this specific application, changing to the proposed WC cutter resulted in savings of approximately 66 % per airplane in tool costs alone and a 62 % reduction in defects. Second is an investigation into the use of tool kits as a means of providing the manufacturing workforce with commonly needed tools. It was found that kits were not as effective as anticipated in reducing the wasted time from retrieving tools at a central location known as a Tool Crib. To ameliorate this, a series of investigations were conducted, creating analytical tools for identifying shortcomings in the tool kitting distribution system. A team was formed to execute improvements based on the analytical tools developed and achieved a 45 % reduction in tools retrieved from outside mechanics' work areas over a 12 -week period. by Jeffrey N.

The focus was on drag-bit cutters that incorporated ultrahard PDC (Polycrystalline Diamond Compact) overlays (i. e., diamond tables) on tungsten carbide substrates. Parameter variations selected for the test cutters included changes in cutter geometry, material composition, and processing conditions. Geometric variables were the diamond-table thickness, the chamfer design for the cutter edge, and the diamond-table/substrate interface configuration. Material and processing variables for the diamond table were, respectively, the nominal diamond particle size and the pressure that was applied during cutter production.
