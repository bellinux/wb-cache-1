50|$|The Apple User Group Connection (AUGC) was {{established}} in 1985 by Apple and led by Apple employee Ellen Leanse. AUGC was formed in response to concerns from users in <b>community</b> <b>user</b> groups that, with release of the Macintosh, development for existing Apple II and Apple III computers was compromised. The idea was for Apple to share information with its user community directly, rather than through the more traditional support and distribution channels. The organization successfully encouraged Apple to pursue early internet technology such as bulletin board systems and ARPANET.|$|E

The content of messages sent via Lone Signal could be syndicated to the Twitter and Facebook accounts of beaming community members as desired.
