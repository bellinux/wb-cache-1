5|$|The {{human brain}} has many {{properties}} that are <b>common</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> vertebrate brains, and shares many features <b>common</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> mammalian brains, most notably a six-layered cerebral cortex {{and a set}} of associated structures, including the hippocampus and amygdala. The cortex is proportionally larger in greater mammals and humans than many other animals. Humans have more association cortex, sensory and motor parts than other mammals such as the rat and the cat.|$|E

5|$|Although much of Thoughts {{is devoted}} to platitudes and advice <b>common</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> conduct books for women, a few {{passages}} anticipate Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), such as her poignant description of the suffering single woman. However, several critics suggested that such passages only seem to have radical undertones in light of Wollstonecraft's later works.|$|E
5|$|Another {{widespread}} trait among modern birds is {{parental care}} for young after hatching. Jack Horner's 1978 {{discovery of a}} Maiasaura ("good mother lizard") nesting ground in Montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among ornithopods, suggesting this behavior might also have been <b>common</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> dinosaurs. There is evidence that other non-theropod dinosaurs, like Patagonian titanosaurian sauropods, also nested in large groups. A specimen of the Mongolian oviraptorid Citipati osmolskae was discovered in a chicken-like brooding position in 1993, which may indicate that they had begun using an insulating layer of feathers to keep the eggs warm. Parental care being a trait <b>common</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> dinosaurs is supported by other finds. For example, a dinosaur embryo (pertaining to the prosauropod Massospondylus) was found without teeth, indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaurs. Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the Isle of Skye in northwestern Scotland. Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that all dinosaurs cared for their young to some extent either before or shortly after hatching.|$|E

5|$|Clear cell {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes up}} less than 5% of diagnosed endometrial cancer.

5|$|Although strenuous and {{requiring}} physical fitness, {{none of the}} conventional routes require specialist mountaineering skills or technical rock climbing.

In serious cases, it can lead to high-altitude pulmonary edema and cerebral edema, which can lead to difficulties with breathing, paralysis, and death. Climbers are advised to begin their ascent at or before 6 a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes. Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, the orator, ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the U.S. government.|$|E
