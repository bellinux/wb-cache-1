5|$|Meanwhile, Kondo ordered Abe's Vanguard {{force to}} race ahead {{to try to}} {{intercept}} and engage the U.S. warships. Kondo also brought his own Advanced force forward at maximum speed so that Junyōs aircraft <b>could</b> <b>join</b> in {{the attacks on the}} U.S. ships. At 08:10, Shōkaku launched a second wave of strike aircraft, consisting of 19 dive bombers and eight Zeros, and Zuikaku launched 16 torpedo bombers at 08:40. Thus, by 09:10 the Japanese had 110 aircraft on the way to attack the U.S. carriers.|$|E

5|$|Monmouth {{learned of}} the {{approach}} of royalist reinforcements and departed, but instead of marching to London, he headed north with his force towards the county of Somerset. On 15 June he fought with the militia at Axminster, taking the town before the militias <b>could</b> <b>join</b> up. More recruits joined his disorganised force, which was now around 6,000, consisting mostly of nonconformists, artisans, and farm workers armed with farm tools (such as pitchforks). One famous supporter was the young Daniel Defoe.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Jamal Al-Durrah (born 1988) was {{in fifth}} grade, but his school was closed on 30 September 2000; the Palestinian Authority {{had called for}} a general strike and day of {{mourning}} following violence in Jerusalem the day before. His mother {{said he had been}} watching the rioting on television and asked if he <b>could</b> <b>join</b> in. Father and son decided instead to go to a car auction. Jamal had just sold his 1974 Fiat, Motro wrote, and Muhammad loved cars, so they went to the auction together.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish {{commander}} Sulzbach made {{a tactical}} error in not attacking either Schack or Eberstein before they <b>could</b> <b>join</b> up, {{even though his}} generals urged him to do so. Instead, he chose to withdraw to Nyborg. The Swedish king was not pleased and immediately sent Gustaf Otto Stenbock to relieve Sulzback of his command. When Stenbock arrived he found the city's defenses wanting and sent a note to the king {{that he could not}} guarantee that he would hold the city.|$|E

On October 11, 2017, the BSA announced that girls would be allowed to become Cub Scouts, starting in 2018, and that in 2019, a separate program for older girls will be available, enabling girls to earn the rank of Eagle Scout.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} {{twenty-three years}} male peasants were drafted {{to serve in the}} military, where they were {{assigned}} to infantry, cavalry, or navy service. After one year of training, they went on to perform a year of actual military service in frontier garrisons or as guards in the capital city. They remained liable to perform this year of service until the age of fifty-six. This was also the age when they were dismissed from their local militias, which they <b>could</b> <b>join</b> once they had finished their year of conscripted service. These non-professional conscripted soldiers comprised the Southern Army (Nanjun 南軍), while the Northern Army (Beijun 北軍) was a standing army composed of paid career soldiers.|$|E
5|$|In December 1928 Crowley met the Nicaraguan Maria Teresa Sanchez. Crowley was {{deported}} from France by the authorities, who disliked {{his reputation}} and feared {{that he was}} a German agent. So that she <b>could</b> <b>join</b> him in Britain, Crowley married Sanchez in August 1929. Now based in London, Mandrake Press agreed to publish his autobiography in a limited edition six-volume set, also publishing his novel Moonchild and book of short stories The Stratagem. Mandrake went into liquidation in November 1930, before the entirety of Crowley's Confessions could be published. Mandrake's owner P.R. Stephenson meanwhile wrote The Legend of Aleister Crowley, an analysis of the media coverage surrounding him.|$|E

5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important to bury the dead in the right way so that he <b>could</b> <b>join</b> the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.|$|E
5|$|Kanhopatra {{was trained}} in dance and song from early {{childhood}} {{so that she}} <b>could</b> <b>join</b> her mother's profession. She became a talented dancer and singer. Her beauty was compared to the apsara (heavenly nymph) Menaka. Shama suggested that Kanhopatra should visit the Badshah (Muslim king), who will adore her beauty and gift her money and jewelry, but Kanhopatra flatly refused. Traditional tales narrate that Shama wanted Kanhopatra to marry, but Kanhopatra longed to marry {{a man who was}} more beautiful than her. Scholar Tara Bhavalkar states that Kanhopatra's marriage was forbidden, as it was not socially acceptable for a daughter of a courtesan to marry.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Rhodesia Regiment {{was soon}} posted back to Cape Town, {{where many of}} the troopers voiced their dissatisfaction at the lack of {{fighting}} in South-West Africa, and requested discharge so they <b>could</b> <b>join</b> the war in Europe. Superiors assured the men that they would see action in East Africa if they stayed, but failed to convince most of them; the 1st Rhodesia Regiment promptly disbanded {{due to a lack of}} personnel. The majority of the South-West Africa veterans boarded ship for England to enlist in the British Army, while others mustered into South African units already billed for European service.|$|E

5|$|Wanting to {{participate}} in the Olympics again, Anderson did what he could to play at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. He negotiated a clause with his team, the Toronto Maple Leafs, to grant him the right to play for Team Canada. This was not enough as Anderson also had to obtain permission from the league. The league had instituted a policy that only players with less than one year of National Hockey League experience <b>could</b> <b>join</b> and therefore turned down his request. The league's decision caused an outrage in Canada. Canada won silver as they lost the gold medal game to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|By this time, with France {{preparing}} {{to withdraw from}} Indochina, senior French officers had begun to undermine Diệm's leadership and his attempts to stabilise South Vietnam. The VNA later implicated the French in the organisation of weapons air drops to Ba Cụt, prompting a protest from Diệm's government. Diệm complained to a French general, alleging that Ba Cụt's men were using French equipment that was of higher quality than that given to the VNA. The Hòa Hảo accused Diệm of treachery in his negotiations with various groups. They charged the prime minister with integrating Thế's forces into the VNA in return for them being allowed to attack Ba Cụt {{with the aid of}} the VNA, and that this part of the deal had been kept secret. They warned that other Hòa Hảo leaders who had stopped fighting <b>could</b> <b>join</b> Ba Cụt, and appealed to Diệm's U.S. sponsors. In response, Ba Cụt ambushed a VNA unit in Long Mỹ, killing three officers and injuring some thirty men.|$|E
5|$|Gromyko and Harriman debated how states {{not universally}} {{recognized}} (e.g., East Germany and China) <b>could</b> <b>join</b> the agreement. The US proposed asserting that accession {{to the treaty}} would not indicate international recognition. This {{was rejected by the}} Soviet Union. Eventually, with Kennedy's approval, US envoys Fisher and McNaughton devised a system whereby multiple government would serve as depositaries for the treaty, allowing individual states to sign only the agreement held by the government of their choice in association with other like-minded states. This solution, which overcame one of the more challenging roadblocks in the negotiations, also served to allay mounting concerns from Macmillan, which were relayed to Washington, that an agreement would once again be derailed. Finally, in an original Soviet draft, the signature of France would have been required for the treaty to come into effect. At Harriman's insistence, this requirement was removed.|$|E

5|$|In August 1943, {{recruiting}} {{policies were}} changed to permit SPARS to marry {{men of the}} USCG without having to resign. The USCG would continue to accept applicants who were married to men in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps, but would not accept {{a woman who was}} already married to an enlisted man or an officer serving in the USCG. However, women <b>could</b> <b>join</b> the SPARS if their husbands were enrolled as temporary members of the reserve. In November 1943, the marriage policy with respect to recruits was changed further to permit women who were wives of cadets, warrant officers, or enlisted men of the USCG to enlist or be commissioned in the SPARs. The ban remained on women whose husbands were commissioned officers in the USCG with the rank of ensign or above.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1937 Colorado was the {{training}} ship for NROTC students from the University of Washington and University of California, Berkeley. She embarked the University of Washington students in Puget Sound on 15 June, and the University of California students four days later in San Francisco Bay. The ship arrived in Hilo, Hawaii, on 26 June and sailed two days later for Lahaina Roads, where the students practiced firing the 5"/51 caliber guns in whose casemates they were berthed in hammocks. Liberty in Honolulu began on 1 July, but was interrupted the following day so Colorado <b>could</b> <b>join</b> the search for Amelia Earhart. She rendezvoused with the Coast Guard cutter Itasca on 7 July; and launched seaplanes to search the Phoenix Islands. After holding a line-crossing ceremony on 9 July, she returned the NROTC students to their schools on the west coast.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 24 June 1801 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars. A British ship of the line, HMS Swiftsure under Captain Benjamin Hallowell was passing westwards through the Southern Mediterranean near Cape Derna when it encountered a much larger French squadron under Contre-Amiral Honoré Ganteaume that was also returning westwards after a failed attempt to reinforce the besieged French garrison in Egypt. Although Hallowell immediately recognised the danger his vessel was in and turned to flee, the French ships were much faster and soon closed with his ship. At 14:00, three French vessels were within long gunshot and Hallowell decided that his only hope of escape lay in disabling the three ships {{before the rest of}} the French squadron <b>could</b> <b>join</b> the engagement. Turning towards the enemy, Hallowell found that his sluggish ship was unable to respond rapidly to French manoeuvres and within two hours Swiftsure was surrounded. Threatened with complete destruction and unable to escape, the British captain surrendered.|$|E
