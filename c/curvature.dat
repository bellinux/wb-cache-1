5|$|For {{surfaces}} in higher dimensions, {{there is more}} than one definition of <b>curvature,</b> including extrinsic (embedding-dependent) measures such as the mean <b>curvature</b> and intrinsic measures such as the Gaussian <b>curvature</b> and Ricci <b>curvature.</b> Correspondingly, there are several ways of defining geometric flows based on <b>curvature,</b> including the mean <b>curvature</b> flow (in which the normal speed of an embedded surface is its mean <b>curvature),</b> the Ricci flow (an intrinsic flow on the metric of a space based on its Ricci <b>curvature)</b> and the Willmore flow (the gradient flow for an energy functional combining the mean <b>curvature</b> and Gaussian <b>curvature).</b> The curve-shortening flow is a special case of the mean <b>curvature</b> flow for one-dimensional curves.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic <b>curvature</b> to some other <b>curvature.</b> Intrinsic <b>curvature</b> is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic <b>curvature</b> is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic <b>curvature</b> it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} this is that the {{pressure}} difference across a fluid interface is proportional to the mean <b>curvature,</b> as seen in the Young–Laplace equation. For an open soap film, the pressure difference is zero, hence the mean <b>curvature</b> is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean <b>curvature.</b>|$|E

5|$|A deeper analogy relates tidal {{forces with}} a {{property}} of surfaces called <b>curvature.</b> For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of tidal forces determines {{whether or not}} the influence of gravity can be eliminated by choosing a freely falling reference frame. Similarly, the absence or presence of <b>curvature</b> determines whether or not a surface is equivalent to a plane. In the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein searched for a geometric formulation of gravity.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{resampled}} {{convolution method}} that they describe for computing a numerical approximation of the curve-shortening flow, they call their method the resampled <b>curvature</b> scale space. They observe that this scale space is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the given shape, and assert that it uniquely determines {{the shape and}} is robust against small variations in the shape. They compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes, and find that the resampled <b>curvature</b> scale space is less computationally intensive, more robust against nonuniform noise, and less strongly influenced by small-scale shape differences.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{distinctive}} feature of Deinonychus, the shape and <b>curvature</b> of the sickle claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker <b>curvature,</b> more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws on the remaining toes. Ostrom suggested that this difference in {{the size and shape}} of the sickle claws could be due to individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted he could not be sure.|$|E

5|$|In mathematics, the curve-shortening flow is {{a process}} that modifies a smooth curve in the Euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to the curve at a speed {{proportional}} to the <b>curvature.</b> The curve-shortening flow {{is an example of a}} geometric flow, and is the one-dimensional case of the mean <b>curvature</b> flow. Other names for the same process include the Euclidean shortening flow, geometric heat flow, and arc length evolution.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} the flow to be well defined, the given curve must be {{sufficiently}} smooth {{that it has a}} continuous <b>curvature.</b> However, once the flow starts, the curve becomes analytic, and remains so until reaching a singularity at which the <b>curvature</b> blows up. For a smooth curve without crossings, the only possible singularity happens when the curve collapses to a point, but immersed curves can have other types of singularity.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} this scheme to be accurate, the time step must {{be large enough}} to cause the curve to move by at least one pixel even at points of low <b>curvature,</b> but small enough to cause the radius of {{blurring}} to be less than the minimum radius of <b>curvature.</b> Therefore, the size of a pixel must be , small enough to allow a suitable intermediate time step to be chosen.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{invariant}} properties of <b>curvatures</b> effected by the Matsumoto's $C$ or $L$-process. We find equivalent conditions on <b>curvatures</b> by comparing {{the difference between the}} corresponding <b>curvatures</b> of closely related connections. As an application, Matsumoto's $L$-process on Randers manifold is studied. Shen connection can not be obtained by using Matsumoto's processes from other well-known connections. This leads us to two new processes which we call Shen's $C$ and $L$-processes. We study the invariant properties of <b>curvatures</b> under the Shen's processes. Comment: 15 page...|$|R

It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when R=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when k does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero <b>curvature</b> but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both.

The practical <b>curvatures</b> were determined on the basis of results of geodetic measurements conducted on observation points situated in form of line. Values of theoretical <b>curvatures</b> were determined by the usage of EDN – OPN computer program, applying the Budryk – Knothe theory assuming the typical values of its parameters (a =  0. 8; tgβ =  2. 0; B =  0. 32 r). Then calculated an unreliability of forecast of curvatures' final values. The regression relation between the observed and theoretical final values of <b>curvatures</b> was determinate assuming the probability of 50 % that the measured value will not exceed the predicted value. The values of standard deviation are between 22. 84 [m− 1   10 − 6], when all final values of measured and theoretical <b>curvatures</b> are simultaneously taken into account in an linear regression analysis, and 25. 32 [m− 1   10 − 6], when a linear regression is carried out for the <b>curvatures</b> measured after the exploitation of the third longwall.
