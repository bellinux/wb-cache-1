Among the essential components (such as ground formation, casing, and cementing) of a geothermal well, the thermal and mechanical stability of the <b>cementing</b> <b>component</b> was discussed based {{on a series of}} parametric studies with consideration of the thermal conductivity and Young’s modulus of the <b>cementing</b> <b>component.</b> With increasing number of casing layers, the <b>cementing</b> <b>component</b> experiences less stress concentration. In addition, the lower thermal conductivity of the cementing material is advantageous for effectively controlling radial displacement. Consequently, it should be noted in geothermal well cementing construction that long-term strength degradation of the cementing might cause the severe structural instability of an entire geothermal well...|$|E

In this study, we compared the clinical and RSA results of these uncemented implants with those of cemented implants. Patients and methods - 41 patients (47 knees) aged 60 years underwent TKR. 22 patients (26 knees) received an uncemented monoblock cruciate-retaining (CR) tibial component (TM) and 19 patients (21 knees) received a cemented NexGen Option CR tibial component. Follow-up examination was done at 10 years, and 16 patients (19 knees) with TM tibial components and 17 patients (18 knees) with <b>cemented</b> tibial <b>components</b> remained for analysis.

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{reactivity}} of cement combination, this paper investigated the Ca(OH) 2 consumption of cement combination pastes containing Portland cement, fly ash, silica fume and metakaolin. Pozzolanic reaction {{is slow and}} it would {{take a long time to}} complete. Due to the disparity in their fineness, silica fume is more reactive than metakaolin and metakaolin is more reactive than fly ash. The Ca(OH) 2 consumption per unit percentage of the cement additions reduced with increasing content with silica fume consuming more than metakaolin and metakaolin consuming more than fly ash. The Ca(OH) 2 consumption of the cement additions, increased with increasing age and increasing fly ash content up to 35 %. Hence, for optimum performance, fly ash as a binary cement should be limited to 35 % content. Where higher reactivity up to 28 days is required, silica fume or metakaolin as binary <b>cement</b> <b>components</b> would perform better at 5 % content than at 10 % content. However, beyond 28 days, either 5 % or 10 % content could be used as there was no difference in the quantity of Ca(OH) 2 consumed at both levels. The Ca(OH) 2 consumption and reactivity of the ternary cement pastes is higher than that of the binary cement pastes. Also, the quantity of Ca(OH) 2 consumed per unit content of the ternary cements increased with increasing content up to 10 %. 15 % would be more than the optimum content of metakaolin as both binary or ternary <b>cement</b> <b>component...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} reasons for {{revision}} of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) are loosening and pain. Cementless components {{may reduce the}} revision rate. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the fixation and clinical outcome of cementless and cemented Oxford UKAs. A total of 43 patients were randomised to receive either a cemented or a cementless Oxford UKA and were followed for two years with radiostereometric analysis (RSA), radiographs aligned with the bone-implant interfaces and clinical scores. The femoral components migrated significantly during the first year (mean 0. 2 mm) but not during the second. There was no significant difference in the extent of migration between cemented and cementless femoral components in either the first or the second year. In the first year the cementless tibial components subsided significantly more than the <b>cemented</b> <b>components</b> (mean 0. 28 mm (sd 0. 17) vs. 0. 09 mm (sd 0. 19 mm)). In the second year, although there was a small amount of subsidence (mean 0. 05 mm) there was no significant difference (p = 0. 92) between cemented and cementless tibial components. There were no femoral radiolucencies. Tibial radiolucencies were narrow (< 1 mm) and were significantly (p = 0. 02) less common with cementless (6 of 21) than cemented (13 of 21) components at two years. There were no complete radiolucencies with cementless components, whereas five of 21 (24 %) <b>cemented</b> <b>components</b> had complete radiolucencies.

40|$|The Oxford Unicompartmental Knee Replacement (UKR) is a {{commonly}} performed procedure, {{with a good}} clinical outcome at 15 years, however, radiolucent lines are commonly found beneath the tibial tray. With the projected increase in knee arthroplasty, particularly in younger patients, implant longevity is of paramount importance. The aim of this thesis is to understand how fixation is achieved with the Oxford UKR {{and how it can}} be improved. A histological study demonstrated that {{in the presence of a}} radiolucent line the tibial bone-cement interface is made up of a combination of direct bony contact, fibrocartilage and fibrous tissue. The radiolucency is more marked when there is more soft tissue. However in all cases there is some direct bony contact. Cemented and cementless fixation was compared in a randomised controlled study using radiostereometric analysis and fluoroscopic imaging of the interfaces. In the first year the cementless tibial component subsided on average 0. 28 mm and had an increased posterior slope of 0. 40 °, whereas the <b>cemented</b> <b>component</b> only subsided 0. 09 mm, with a 0. 10 ° increase in slope. In the second year both components had very little further subsidence (mean Two designs of lateral UKR were also compared. These had a flat tibial component that predominantly transmits compressive loading, and a domed component that also transmits shear. There was a lower prevalence of radiolucency in the domed tibia (13 % v 60 %), even though there was a similar amount of migration as the <b>cemented</b> medial tibial <b>component.</b> In conclusion radiolucent lines, both partial and complete, are common with <b>cemented</b> <b>components,</b> and may, in part, be a result of compressive loading. They are associated with good long-term results and direct bone cement contact indicating satisfactory fixation. However, they are also associated with increased migration and soft tissue at the interface suggesting that the fixation, although satisfactory, is suboptimal. The cementless components had no complete radiolucencies and low levels of migration in the second year. This suggests that bone ingrowth and secure fixation occurs reliably, and therefore that cementless fixation may be better than cemented for the Oxford UKR.
