It is therefore convenient for a user to print out a <b>reference</b> <b>card.</b> While <b>reference</b> <b>cards</b> can be printed on card stock, {{it is common to}} print them on ordinary printer paper. With the advent of portable electronic devices that can display documents, digital <b>reference</b> <b>cards</b> stored in PDF or HTML formats have become more common.

40|$|When {{identifying}} and elaborating compliance requirements, analysts {{need to follow}} the <b>cross</b> <b>references</b> in legal texts and consider the additional information in the cited provisions. Enabling easier navigation and handling of <b>cross</b> <b>references</b> requires automated support {{for the detection of}} the natural language expressions used in <b>cross</b> <b>references,</b> the interpretation of <b>cross</b> <b>references</b> in their context, and the linkage of <b>cross</b> <b>references</b> to the targeted provisions. In this article, we propose an approach and tool sup- port for automated detection and resolution of <b>cross</b> <b>references.</b> The approach leverages the structure of legal texts, formalized into a schema, and a set of natural language patterns for legal <b>cross</b> <b>reference</b> expressions. These patterns were developed based on an investigation of Luxembourg’s legislation, written in French. To build confidence about their applicability beyond the context where they were observed, these patterns were validated against the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) by the Government of Ontario, Canada, written in both French and English. We report on an empirical evaluation where we assess the accuracy and scalability of our framework over several Luxembourgish legislative texts as well as PHIPA...|$|R

Background: Healthcare professionals who service those with a severe mental illness (SMI) diagnosis face many unique challenges. One particular challenge is medical assessment of patients with a SMI diagnosis. Often CMs do not have a background or work experience differentiating medical concerns from psychiatric signs and symptoms. Methods: <b>Reference</b> <b>cards</b> were developed {{at the request of the}} IMPACT team. Feedback was elicited through a one-time focus group session conducted by an independent party on the use of the <b>reference</b> <b>cards</b> as an educational tool. Anonymity was maintained. The responses were evaluated for themes. The moderator asked questions regarding the <b>reference</b> <b>cards</b> in each of the following areas: usability when answering questions about hypo- and hyperglycemia, stroke and heat stroke, understanding key points, recommendations for enhancement, and presentation of information. Results: Of the 8 CMs on the IMPACT team, 5 participated. Identified themes were quick reference and easily identifiable information. The use of pictures to illustrate the concepts was helpful. The language was appropriate for the cards and readily understandable. Suggestions for changes to the existing cards included use of a larger font, lighter background color, and moving medication information to the same side of the card. The limited availability of the heat stroke card in the summer was an identified limitation. Conclusions: The use of <b>reference</b> <b>cards</b> as an educational tool for CMs has not been extensively reviewed. Although data are limited from this pilot project, the CMs are enthusiastic about this resource and requested cards on additional topics...|$|R
