5000|$|While plain slides are {{the most}} common, there are several {{specialized}} types. A concavity slide or cavity slide has one or more shallow depressions ("wells"), designed to hold slightly thicker objects, and certain samples such as liquids and tissue cultures. [...] Slides may have rounded corners for increased safety or robustness, or a <b>cut-off</b> <b>corner</b> for use with a slide clamp or cross-table, where the slide is secured by a spring-loaded curved arm contacting one corner, forcing the opposing corner of the slide against a right angled arm which does not move. If this system were used with a slide which did not incorporate these cut-off corners, the corners would chip and the slide could shatter.|$|E
50|$|The Levin House is {{designed}} in the Historicist style with influence from Italian Renaissance architecture and consists of two stories with Mansard roof over a high cellar. The original villa consisted of four bays facing Havnegade and two bays facing Tordenskjoldsgade. The extension which integrated it in the block structure added three bays facing the water and two bays on Tordenskjoldsgade where a gate separates the property from the neighboring, five-story apartment building. The diagonally <b>cut-off</b> <b>corner</b> features a canted bay window topped by a balcony and with Corinthian order pilasters flanking the windows on the second floor. There are rustication on the high cellar and at the corners. The interior of the building originally featured decorations on walls and ceilings by Georg Hilker {{but they have been}} lost.|$|E
40|$|International audienceModal {{observations}} of a piano soundboard are compared with results predicted by a model consisting of weakly coupled homogeneous sub-structures. The model is entirely {{determined by the}} coarse geometry of the soundboard (main plate, ribs, bridges, <b>cut-off</b> <b>corners)</b> and by the elastic parameters of the wood species. It {{can also be used}} to predict the point-mobility at the bridge (where strings are attached) or far from it. The agreement between observations and model predictions is excellent, both in the low- and high-frequency regimes (respectively below and above approximately 1 kHz). Applications include a comparison between the characteristics of different pianos as well as the influence of the wood properties on the point-mobility. Some consequences in terms of acoustical radiation will also be presented...|$|R
5000|$|Paper roll tickets {{carry the}} Rail Settlement Plan form number RSP 3594: {{the same as}} on post-privatisation SPORTIS tickets, as SPORTIS used the same blank stock. Gatwick Express has {{frequently}} used dedicated stock, RSP 3594/GA, with a red colour scheme and security background (RSP 3594 is orange with a pale green background). Three types of card stock have been used: two versions with the form number RSP 3599, and one (used most often as of 2007) numbered RSP 9299. On {{the first version of}} RSP 3599, each ticket had diagonally <b>cut-off</b> <b>corners,</b> but this later changed to rounded corners as is standard on most other ticket issuing systems. Both of these types had pre-printed headings such as [...] "Class" [...] and [...] "Ticket Type". With the move to [...] "Common Stock" [...] ticketing, where all information is printed by the machine, RSP 9299 stock with no pre-printed headings was introduced. These tickets have always had rounded corners.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This {{paper is}} focused on the problem of {{transient}} and notching recognition. Especially, a problem of frequency characteristic of real impulses are considered. Aim of the paper is to determine a minimum covered frequency bandwidth, when dealing with this kind of disturbances. Parameters of the selected transient and notching disturbances are determined, after extracting disturbances by pass-band filters with various <b>corner</b> (<b>cut-off)</b> frequencies. Finally, some remarks regarding these disturbances measurements are presented. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the six-vertex model in an L-shaped {{domain of the}} square lattice, with domain wall boundary conditions. For free-fermion vertex weights the partition function can be {{expressed in terms of}} some Hankel determinant, or equivalently as a Coulomb gas with discrete measure and a non-polynomial potential with two hard walls. We use Coulomb gas methods to study the partition function in the thermodynamic limit. We obtain the free energy of the six-vertex model {{as a function of the}} parameters describing the geometry of the scaled L-shaped domain. Under variations of these parameters the system undergoes a third-order phase transition. The result can also be considered in the context of dimer models, for the perfect matchings of the Aztec diamond graph with a <b>cut-off</b> <b>corner.</b> Comment: 28 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the domino tilings of an Aztec diamond with a <b>cut-off</b> <b>corner</b> of macroscopic square shape and given size, {{and address the}} bulk properties of tilings as the size is varied. We observe that the free energy exhibits a third-order phase transition when the cut-off square, increasing in size, reaches the arctic ellipse [...] -the phase separation curve of the original (unmodified) Aztec diamond. We obtain this result by studying the thermodynamic limit of certain nonlocal correlation function of the underlying six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions, the so-called emptiness formation probability (EFP). We consider EFP in two different representations: as a tau-function for Toda chains and as a random matrix model integral. The latter has a discrete measure and a linear potential with hard walls; the observed phase transition shares properties with both Gross-Witten-Wadia and Douglas-Kazakov phase transitions.

International audienceIn string musical instruments, the sound is radiated by the soundboard, subject to the strings excitation. This vibration of this rather complex structure is described here with models which need {{only a small number}} of parameters. Predictions of the models are compared with results of experiments that have been presented in Ege et al. [Vibroacoustics of the piano soundboard: (Non) linearity and modal properties in the low- and mid- frequency ranges, Journal of Sound and Vibration 332 (5) (2013) 1288 - 1305]. The apparent modal density of the soundboard of an upright piano in playing condition, as seen from various points of the structure, exhibits two well-separated regimes, below and above a frequency flim that is determined by the wood characteristics and by the distance between ribs. Above flim, most modes appear to be localised, presumably due to the irregularity of the spacing and height of the ribs. The low-frequency regime is predicted by a model which consists of coupled sub-structures: the two ribbed areas split by the main bridge and, in most cases, one or two so-called <b>cut-off</b> <b>corners.</b> In order to assess the dynamical properties of each of the subplates (considered here as homogeneous plates), we propose a derivation of the (low-frequency) modal density of an orthotropic homogeneous plate which accounts for the boundary conditions on an arbitrary geometry. Above flim, the soundboard, as seen from a given excitation point, is modelled as a set of three structural wave-guides, namely the three inter-rib spacings surrounding the excitation point. Based on these low- and high-frequency models, computations of the point-mobility and of the apparent modal densities seen at several excitation points match published measurements. The dispersion curve of the wave-guide model displays an acoustical radiation scheme which differs significantly from that of a thin homogeneous plate. It appears that piano dimensioning is such that the subsonic regime of acoustical radiation extends over a much wider frequency range than it would be for a homogeneous plate with the same low-frequency vibration. One problem in piano manufacturing is examined in relationship with the possible radiation schemes induced by the models...|$|R

40|$|Volcanic {{activity}} of Mount Talang – West Sumatera {{is very interesting}} to be studied and to be learned, because its activity was influenced by geological structures {{in the vicinity of}} Mount Talang which is a depression zone of Sumatera Fault. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of volcanic earthquakes at Mount Talang in the period of January to March 2013 based on the spectral analysis and hypocenter analysis. In addition, the velocity estimation was carried out to determine the value of the corresponding seismic wave velocity in the vicinity of Mount Talang. Volcanic earthquake signals obtained from four seismic stations Gabuo,Ketah, Puncak and Kopi. The seismic signals are selected first and then grouped by the type of the earthquake. Spectral analysis is performed to determine the value of the dominant frequency and the <b>cut-off</b> frequency (<b>corner</b> frequency) of volcanic earthquakes. Hipocenter analysis aims to determine the hipocenter depth of vulcanic earthquake. Based on the spectral analysis, the frequency content of volcanic earthquakes ranged from 3. 12 to 17. 87 Hz. The high frequency content can be correlated with geological structures in the vicinity of Mount Talang which {{is in the form of}} cracks / faults as a manifestation of the Great Sumatera Fault zone. Based on a formula which is known before, it can be seen that the estimation of rupture length is ranged between 67 to 142 m. The hypocenter distribution of volcanic earthquakes ranged from 2 to 9 km below the summit of Mount Talang. Based on the results of seismic wave velocity estimation that fits around Mount Talang is at the velocity between 2. 5 to 2. 8 km / s. Where the condition of the surrounding medium is still relatively compact...|$|R
