40|$|A brief {{review is}} given of the properties, occurrence, {{and public health}} {{significance}} of chlamydiae in man and animals and of the diagnosis and control of <b>chlamydial</b> <b>infections.</b> Chlamydiae occur naturally in {{a large number of}} avian and mammalian species. Man is the primary host of chlamydiae causing trachoma, inclusion conjunctivitis, genito-urinary tract infection, and lymphogranuloma venereum. In animals <b>chlamydial</b> <b>infections</b> have been recognized as a cause of pneumonia, encephalitis, abortion, arthritis, diarrhoea, and conjunctivitis. <b>Chlamydial</b> <b>infections</b> have been recognized {{in a wide range of}} avian hosts. Sporadic psittacosis/ornithosis in man is associated with close exposure to birds and may occur as an occupational disease. Transmission studies suggest that mammalian chlamydial strains are not very host-specific and that diseases and even chains of infection may develop in secondary hosts. There are a few well-documented cases of human infection with chlamydiae of mammalian origin. Although various chlamydial isolates have specific antigenic components, no routine test for identifying different serotypes has been generally accepted. Further investigation of the host range of chlamydiae and of their antigenic properties is essential for a more accurate assessment of the potential danger of chlamydia-infected animals to human health. The frequent occurrence of inapparent or latent infections makes it imperative to establish adequate laboratory facilities for the effective surveillance and control of <b>chlamydial</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R

We estimated the separate contributions of the direct and indirect effects of screening on PID cases prevented per 100, 000 women.

In the present study, we evaluated the role of caspase- 1 in <b>chlamydial</b> <b>infection</b> and pathogenesis. Although <b>chlamydial</b> <b>infection</b> induced caspase- 1 activation and processing of IL- 1 β, mice competent and mice deficient in caspase- 1 experienced similar courses of <b>chlamydial</b> <b>infection</b> in their urogenital tracts, suggesting that Chlamydia-activated caspase- 1 did not {{play a significant role}} in resolution of <b>chlamydial</b> <b>infection.</b> However, when genital tract tissue pathologies were examined, the caspase- 1 -deficient mice displayed much reduced inflammatory damage.
