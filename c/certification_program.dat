However, while <b>certification</b> <b>programs</b> have become more widespread in recent years, little is known about persons who have become certified, their employers (whether private, government, or non-profit) or the position titles they hold. This paper investigates GIS <b>certification</b> <b>programs</b> in the U. S. and abroad using data from certification registries. The analysis reveals the broad appeal of the Geographic Information System Professional (GISP) certification, even among persons certified by other organizations such as the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS). Along with providing a comparison of <b>certification</b> <b>programs,</b> the role of higher education is discussed in the context of efforts to move from portfolio-based procedures for evaluating certification applicants to competency-based systems that utilize an examination component...|$|R
