5|$|York's first {{match in}} the Football League was against Wigan Borough at Springfield Park on 31 August 1929 and {{finished}} with a 2–0 victory for the visitors. Reg Stockill, the scorer of the first goal, became the youngest player to represent the club in a competitive match {{at the age of}} 15 years and 281 days. The 1929–30 season brought two meetings with First Division team Newcastle United in the FA Cup third round, and a sixth-place finish in York's debut Football League season. Collier resigned as manager in May 1930 and George Sherrington took over for the following three years, combining this with his role as club secretary. Sherrington's first season in charge saw York rank 12th in the league, and they again faced First Division opposition in the FA Cup third round, taking Sheffield United to a replay. Despite an improved league position of ninth in 1931–32, York were eliminated from the FA Cup in the first round. This, combined with disappointing average home crowds, resulted in a deficit of £1,539 over the season. In August 1932, York moved to a new ground at Bootham Crescent, which was closer than Fulfordgate to the club's <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and the railway station. The ground was officially opened for a match with Stockport County on 31 August 1932; it ended a 2–2 draw, and the first goalscorer at the ground was Tom Mitchell. York's worst performance in the Football League to date came in 1932–33, finishing in 20th place. The club only avoided having to seek re-election after winning the last match of the season.|$|E
2500|$|The end of {{the debate}} was {{something}} of an anti-climax, with Banda proclaiming that, [...] "This is not a cabinet crisis at all...". However, as all members of parliament were required to speak, they had to declare for or against the motion of confidence. Few spoke in favour of the ex-ministers, even their family members. After the debate, Jones suggested that Banda should meet the ex-ministers. Banda was unwilling to meet them {{as long as they}} insisted on an all or nothing reinstatement, but he was willing to consider re-instating Chokani and Bwanausi, and possibly Chirwa, but not Chipembere or Chiume. Jones' efforts to enable the reinstatement some of the ministers between September 16 and 18 failed, as did his lat-ditch attempt at compromise on September 26, when a meeting planned by Chipembere in Blantyre on that day and the next was banned, ostensibly because he had not obtained police permission. As clashes between supporters of the ex-ministers and Banda began, any hope of reconciliation faded. Over the next few weeks a number of senior civil servants and associates of the former ministers left Malawi as the conflict spread. Zomba became a <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the ex-ministers, when civil servants clashed with MCP supporters on 28 September, and two newly appointed ministers were attacked. By 30 September, Chipembere's supporters controlled the town until troops and police moved in to restore calm.|$|E

The BNP had respectable results in the area in a series of council by-elections in 1990.

50|$|After the Norman Conquest, William Rufus made Robert Fitzhamon {{the first}} baron or {{overlord}} of Gloucester. Fitzhamon had {{a military base}} at Cardiff Castle, and for the succeeding years the history of Gloucester was closely linked to that of Cardiff. During the Anarchy, Gloucester was a <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the Empress Matilda who was supported in her claim to the throne by her half-brother, Fitzhamon's grandson, Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (also known as Robert of Gloucester). After this period of strife ended with the marriage of Matilda to Henry I of England, Henry granted Robert possession of Cardiff Castle, and it later passed to Mathilda's son Robert Curthose and his son, William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester. The story of the Anarchy is vividly told {{in a series of}} nineteenth-century paintings by William Burges at the Castle.|$|E
50|$|However, Airdrie {{really came}} to {{prominence}} through its weaving industry. Airdrie Weavers Society {{was founded in}} 1781 and flax was being grown in sixteen farms {{in and around the}} burgh. In {{the last decade of the}} eighteenth century, coal mining was in progress and around thirty colliers were employed. Weaving continued to flourish making up a substantial part of the population of over 2,500 around the turn of the 19th century. Given its large number of weavers, its geographic location, and a large number of unemployed soldiers following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Airdrie became a major <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the Radical War of 1820. The rapid pace of population growth continued and by 1821 there were 4,862 inhabitants. At this time the number of houses being built increased dramatically and in 1821, by a private Act of Parliament, Airdrie became a free and independent Burgh of Barony. Due to the fact it was 'independent', it had all the powers of a Royal Burgh.|$|E

5000|$|Lanchester {{began to}} study {{aeronautics}} seriously in 1892, eleven years before the first successful powered flight. Whilst crossing the Atlantic on a voyage to the United States, Lanchester studied the flight of herring gulls, seeing how {{they were able to}} use motionless wings to catch up-currents of air. He measured various birds to see how the centre of gravity compared with the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> As a result of his deliberations, Lanchester, eventually formulated his circulation theory of flight. This is the basis of aerodynamics and the foundation of modern aerofoil theory. In 1894 he tested his theory on a number of models. In 1897 he presented a paper entitled [...] "The soaring of birds and the possibilities of mechanical flight" [...] to the Physical Society, but it was rejected, being too advanced for its time. Lanchester realised that powered flight required an engine with a much greater power-to-weight ratio than any existing engine. He proposed to design and build such an engine, but was advised that no one would take him seriously.|$|E
5000|$|However, Waterford's Roman Catholic {{population}} became deeply {{alienated from}} the English Protestant state in Ireland in the following 40 years. After the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Waterford was a <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the Confederate Catholics of Ireland - a de facto independent Irish state formed to fight for Irish Catholic interests in the Irish Confederate Wars. Within the Confederation, Waterford was known for its militant Catholic politics - rejecting an alliance signed between the Confederates and Charles I that would have sent Irish troops {{to fight for the}} King in the English Civil War. Waterford was visited by the Papal Nuncio to Ireland, Giovanni Battista Rinuccini in 1648. The latter, in his [...] "Report on the Affairs of Ireland" [...] sent to Pope Innocent X, described Waterford as being [...] "one of the only two Irish cities he would place in the front rank for reverence to the Holy See." [...] In 1649 during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, the city was unsuccessfully besieged by Oliver Cromwell, but was forced to surrender to his Deputy, Henry Ireton, after a prolonged siege in the summer of the following year.|$|E

40|$|Magister Educationis - MEdThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the nature of support services offered to Extended Curriculum Programme students in a South African university. The primary goals of support services in higher education are to support students holistically and reduce barriers to learning in the teaching and learning environment. One of the faculties in a South African university established a support unit to assist with the low throughput level. The academic support unit is housed in the Academic Development Department (ADD) in a faculty. The unit attempts to address the needs of underachieving students in the Extended Curriculum Programme (ECP). The thesis first identifies the challenges the ECP students are experiencing. Then, support services in the university and in the support unit are described. Thereafter, the challenges experienced by the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> services in the university and the support unit are illuminated. Qualitative data was gathered through individual interviews with senior management. Then, a focus group discussion with tutors who volunteer in a support unit was facilitated and lastly the staff members employed in the support unit were also interviewed individually. The thesis was able to identify the intrinsic and extrinsic barriers to learning the ECP students are experiencing. It became evident that the support services available in the university and the support unit are not sufficient to address the needs of the students. The challenges the support service centre of the university and the support unit are experiencing are twofold. The first is a lack of organisational resources that hinders service delivery, the second is a lack of skills and expertise in attain structures that limits the provision of support services...|$|E
40|$|Ten reinforced-concrete {{continuous}} deep beams {{with openings}} were tested to failure. The main variables investi-gated were the shear span-to-overall depth ratio, {{and the size}} and location of openings. Two failure modes influenced by the size and location of web openings regardless of the shear span-to-overall depth ratio were observed. The normalised load capacity of beams having a web opening area ratio of 0. 025 within exterior shear spans was approximately {{similar to that of}} their companion solid beams. Continuous deep beams having web openings within interior shear spans exhibited a higher load capacity reduction with the increase of the opening size, similar to simply supported deep beams with web openings. Formulae based on the upper bound analysis of the plasticity theory were proposed to predict the load capacity of continuous deep beams with web openings. Comparisons between the measured and predicted load capacities showed a good agreement.
