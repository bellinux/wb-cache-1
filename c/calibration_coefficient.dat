40|$|A log-derived <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficient</b> is {{introduced}} to calibrate conventional water saturation models in tight shaly sandstone reservoirs in the Rocky Mountains, western United States, in this study. It is implemented for calibration of eight traditional saturation models in this giant gas field to prove its validity. The {{application of this}} <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficient</b> indicates {{that it is a}} simple and strong tool for improving of water saturation estimation in tight shaly sandstones, particularly for zones with high GR and/or low true resistivity. The proposed <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficient</b> is based upon an expression which depends on true resistivity log, neutron and density logs to take total porosity and gamma ray log. It has a significant advantage i. e. independency from electrical rock properties (Archie's parameters) : m (cementation factor), n (saturation exponent) and a (tortuosity factor). It means that the variety of them cannot affect the operation of the introduced <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficient.</b> In this study, the calibration results of the eight traditional water saturation models are compared with core results for 2579 data points that are taken from fourteen wells (39 different zones) from Mesaverde in five western USA basins.

40|$|In this study, Cross {{calibration}} {{was conducted}} at the Libya 4 PICS site on 2015 using Landsat- 8 and KOMPSAT- 3 A. Ideally a cross calibration should be calculated for each individual scene pair because on any given date the TOA spectral profile is influenced by sun and satellite view geometry and the atmospheric conditions. However, using the near-simultaneous images minimizes this effect because the sensors are viewing the same atmosphere. For the cross calibration, the <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficient</b> was calculated by comparing the at sensor spectral radiance for the same location calculated using the Landsat- 8 calibration parameters in metadata and the DN of KOMPSAT- 3 A for the regions of interest (ROI). Cross calibration can be conducted because the satellite sensors used for overpass have a similar bandwidth. However, not all satellites have the same color filter transmittance and sensor reactivity, even though {{the purpose is to}} observe the visible bands. Therefore, the differences in the RSR should be corrected.

40|$|AREVA Mines and the Nuclear Measurement Laboratory of CEA Cadarache are collaborating {{to improve}} the {{sensitivity}} and precision of uranium concentration measurement by means of gamma ray logging. The determination of uranium concentration in boreholes is performed with the Natural Gamma Ray Sonde (NGRS) based on a NaI(Tl) scintillation detector. The total gamma count rate is converted into uranium concentration using a <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficient</b> measured in concrete blocks with known uranium concentration in the AREVA Mines calibration facility located in Bessines, France. Until now, {{to take into account}} gamma attenuation in a variety of boreholes diameters, tubing materials, diameters and thicknesses, filling fluid densities and compositions, a semi-empirical formula was used to correct the <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficient</b> measured in Bessines facility. In this work, we propose to use Monte Carlo simulations to improve gamma attenuation corrections. To this purpose, the NGRS probe and the calibration measurements in the standard concrete blocks have been modeled with MCNP computer code. The <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficient</b> determined by simulation, 5. 3 s- 1. ppmU- 1 ± 10 %, is in good agreement with the one measured in Bessines, 5. 2 s- 1. ppmU- 1. Based on the validated MCNP model, several parametric studies have been performed. For instance, the rock density and chemical composition proved to have a limited impact on the <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficient.</b> However, gamma self-absorption in uranium leads to a nonlinear relationship between count rate and uranium concentration beyond approximately 1 % of uranium weight fraction, the underestimation of the uranium content reaching more than a factor 2. 5 for a 50 % uranium weight fraction.

40|$|AbstractGlobal solar {{irradiance}} measurement {{is used for}} applications such as verifying satellite measurements, studying the distribution and variation of the received radiation or estimating the energy yield of solar plants. This measurement is directly influenced by the reference <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the field pyranometer used. The radiometer calibration laboratory of CENER is accredited by ENAC (Spanish National Accreditation Body) since 2010 according to ISO 9847 : 1992 for the calibration of field pyranometers via comparison to a reference pyranometer. The accreditation's scope covers calibrations “type Ia” (outdoor horizontal calibrations for meteorological and resource measurements, part 5. 2. 2, annex B. 2). For the outdoor calibration, the methodology takes different sky conditions into account: stable cloudless sky conditions, unstable sky conditions with some clouds or cloudy sky conditions. The classification criteria described by the standard have been enhanced by CENER for an easier application, establishing additional radiometric conditions, especially for unstable sky conditions with some clouds. Detailed criteria are based on CENER's experience in solar collector testing and on the experimental CENER BSRN station (Baseline Surface Radiation Network) measurements and total sky camera images. During laboratory activity, several <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficient</b> results have been analyzed in order to validate the three methodologies regarding the before mentioned sky conditions. The <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficient</b> can be slightly different depending on the sky conditions and the calibration methodology; therefore global solar irradiation measurements can differ too.

40|$|The air kerma area product PKA is an {{important}} quantity used by hospital physicists in quality assurance and optimization processes in diagnostic radiology and is recommended by national authorities for setting of diagnostic reference levels. PKA can be measured using a transmission ionization chamber (kerma area product (KAP) meter) mounted on the collimator housing. Its signal QKAP must be calibrated to give values of PKA. The objective of this thesis is to analyze the factors influencing {{the accuracy of the}} <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficients</b> k= PKA/QKAP and of reported PKA-values. Due to attenuation and scatter in the KAP-meter and presence of extra-focal radiation, values of PKA depend on the choice of integration area A and the distance of the reference plane from the focal spot yielding values of PKA that may differ by as much as 23 % depending on this choice. The two extremes correspond to (1) PKA=PKA,o integrated over the exit surface of the KAP-meter resulting in geometry independent <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficients</b> and (2) PKA=PKA,Anom integrated over the nominal beam area in the patient entrance plane resulting in geometry dependent <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Three <b>calibration</b> methods are analysed. Method 1 aims at determine PKA,Anom, for clinical use at the patient entrance plane. At standard laboratories, the method is used to calibrate with respect to radiation incident on the KAP-meter. Problems with extra-focal and scattered radiation are then avoided resulting in <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficients</b> with low standard uncertainty (± 1. 5 %, coverage factor 2). Method 2 was designed in this work to approach determination of PKA,o using thermoluminescent detectors to monitor contributions from extra-focal radiation and account for the heel effect. The uncertainty in derived <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficients</b> was ± 3 % (coverage factor 2). Method 3 uses a Master KAP-meter calibrated at a standard laboratory for incident radiation to calibrate clinical KAP-meters. It has potential to become the standard method in the future replacing the tedious method 2 for calibrations aiming at determination of PKA,o. Commercially available KAP-meters use conducting layers of indium oxide causing a strong energy dependence of their <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficients.</b> This dependence is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations and measurements. It may introduce substantial uncertainties in reported PKA– values since <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficients</b> as obtained from standard laboratories are often available only at one filtration (2. 5 mm Al) as function of tube voltage or HVL. This is not sufficient since higher filtrations are commonly used in practice, including filters of Cu. In extreme cases, <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the same value of HVL but using different tube voltages and filtrations can deviate by as much as 30 %. If standardised calibration methods are not used and choice of <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficients</b> not carefully chosen with respect to beam quality, the total uncertainty in reported PKA–values may be as large as 40 - 45 %. Conversion of PKA-values to risk related quantities is briefly discussed. The large energy dependence of the conversion coefficients, ε/PKA, for determination of energy imparted,ε, to the patient reduces to a lower energy dependence of <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficients</b> CQ,ε = ε/QKAP for determination of ε from the KAP-meter signal...|$|R
40|$|DIMITRI is a {{tool that}} has been {{developed}} for monitoring the radiometric performance of optical instruments onboard Earth observation satellites. It includes a reflectance model through which a <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficient</b> is computed which is used for performance monitoring. In this thesis, the uncertainty {{that is associated with}} this coefficient is researched and a classification in random and systematic uncertainty components is attempted. Throughout this research it became clear that such a classification is somewhat ambiguous and can be misleading because systematic uncertainties are not always constant. In order to identify such uncertainties, the entire modelling / measurement process with respect to the input variables of the reflectance model, and the algorithm of the reflectance model itself, have been researched for potential uncertainty sources. What became clear is that input variable uncertainties are of both nature; random and systematic. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted to assess how the <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficient</b> depends on changes in the input variables. Out of these, the Chlorophyll variable causes the highest deviations due to the large uncertainties associated with this parameter. This research has been able to identify uncertainty sources but {{has not been able to}} assign any value to those sources. Any subsequent research could use the identified uncertainty sources described here and attempt to quantify their value to yield a total uncertainty that can be associated to the <b>calibration</b> <b>coefficient.</b> This will increase the usability of this performance monitoring coefficient which means that the user will obtain more information regarding the accuracy of the performance degradation of the optical instrument onboard Earth observation satellites.

However, conductance volume measurements are also affected by parallel conductance, which may confound cali-bration coefficient estimation. This study was un-dertaken to examine the variation in α using a physical model of the left ventricle without parallel conductance. Calibration coefficients were calculated as the conductance-volume quotient (αV(t)) or the stroke conductance-stroke volume quotient (αSV). Both calibration coefficients varied as a non-linear function of the ventricular volume. Conductance volume measurements calibrated with αV(t) estimated ventricular volume to within 2. 0 ± 6. 9 %.
