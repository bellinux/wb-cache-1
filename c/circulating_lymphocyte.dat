RESULTS [...] Seven hours after the first dose of prednisolone {{there was a significant}} fall in absolute numbers of lymphocytes, T cells, CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells, and B cells. The percentage of T cells fell significantly, due to a fall in percentage of CD 4 + cells. In contrast to the seven hour findings, at 72 hours there was a significant rise in absolute numbers of lymphocytes, T cells, CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and B cells. This trend was already apparent by 24 hours. The percentage of CD 4 + cells was significantly raised at 72 hours, while that of CD 8 + cells had fallen significantly. The percentage of natural killer cells had fallen at 72 hours; that of B cells remained increased at 72 hours.

40|$|The current {{studies were}} {{undertaken}} {{to explore the}} relationship between enhanced sympathetic nervous activity and lymphocyte subset distribution in three settings: congestive heart failure, dynamic exercise, and beta-adrenergic agonist treatment. We compared the number and subset distribution of <b>circulating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in 36 patients with congestive heart failure and 31 age-matched control subjects. The number of <b>circulating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was lower in heart failure than in control. This was due {{to a reduction in}} Tsuppressor/cytotoxic and natural killer cells without significant alteration of Thelper cells. The extent of the alteration was similar in patients with idiopathic and ischemic heart failure, but the reduction was more pronounced in patients with New York Heart Association class III-IV than in class I-II. The plasma catecholamine elevation in heart failure was also independent of etiology but more pronounced in the more severely ill patients. We also assessed lymphocyte subsets after acute stimulation of sympathetic activity by dynamic exercise and after treatment with the beta-adrenergic agonist terbutaline. Dynamic exercise until exhaustion increased the number of <b>circulating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in healthy controls and heart failure patients in a subset-selective manner. By contrast, a 7 -d treatment with terbutaline caused a reduction in the <b>circulating</b> number of <b>lymphocytes</b> in some subsets that was identical to that seen in heart failure patients.

40|$|Sepsis is a {{systemic}} inflammatory response syndrome due to infection. The incidence rate {{is estimated to}} be up to 19 million cases worldwide per year and the number of cases is rising.

Furthermore, the involvement of effector immune system cells also impairs the host response to the infective agents and tissue damage.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to determine what, if any, differential effect various commonly used corticosteroid preparations had on the numbers and specific functions of lymphocyte subpopulations when these agents were administered in equivalent pharmacological dosages. Normal volunteers received a single dose of either 320 mg of hydrocortisone intravenously, 80 mg of prednisone orally, or 12 mg of dexamethasone orally. There was a marked lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia maximal 4 - 6 hr following administration of all three corticosteroid preparations with almost identical kinetics and degree of fall in total cell numbers as well as proportions of thymus-derived and bone marrow-derived lymphocytes. Hydrocortisone and prednisone caused only a slight suppression of phytohaemagglutiinin (PHA) induced lymphocyte blastogensis which could be reversed at supra-optimal concentrations of PHA. On the contrary, dexamethasone administration casued a marked suppression of PHA responses which was not reversed by supra-optimal PHA stimulation. In addition, hydrocortisone and prednisone administration did not suppress non-specific PHA-induced cellular cytotoxcity, while dexamethasone caused a marked suppression (P less than 0. 001) of cytotoxicity. These studies show that although equivalent anti-inflammatory doses of these three corticosteroid preparations cause almost identical suppression of the numbers of <b>circulating</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> populations, they have a differential effect of the numbers of <b>circulating</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> populations, they have a differential effect on a certain in vitro functional correlates of cell-mediated immunity...|$|E

It has been shown that tobacco smoking enhances telomere shortening in <b>circulating</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> The present study investigated whether this effect was further amplified in smokers who develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Telomere length was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridisation in <b>circulating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> harvested from 26 never-smokers, 24 smokers with normal lung function and 26 smokers with moderate-to-severe airflow obstruction (forced expiratory flow in one second 48 ¡ 4 % predicted).

There was also a dose–effect relationship between the cumulative long-life exposure to tobacco smoking (pack-yrs) and telomere length.

OBJECTIVE: The mycobacterial antigen heparin-binding-hemagglutinin (HBHA) induces strong interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responses by <b>circulating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from Mycobacterium tuberculosis latently infected subjects, and low responses associated with CD 4 (+) regulatory T (Treg) cells in TB patients. Here, we investigated HBHA-specific IFN-gamma responses {{at the site of the}} TB disease. METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavages, pleural fluids and blood were prospectively collected from 61 patients with a possible diagnosis of pulmonary and/or pleural TB. HBHA-specific IFN-gamma production was analyzed by flow cytometry and ELISA. The suppressive effect of pleural Treg cells was investigated by depletion experiments. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The percentages of HBHA-induced IFN-gamma(+) alveolar and pleural lymphocytes were higher for pulmonary (P< 0. 0001) and for pleural (P< 0. 01) TB than for non-TB controls. Local CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells produced the HBHA-specific IFN-gamma. This local secretion was not suppressed by Treg lymphocytes, contrasting with previously reported data on <b>circulating</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> CONCLUSION: TB patients display differential effector and regulatory T cell responses to HBHA in local and <b>circulating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> with a predominant effector CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) response locally, compared to a predominant Treg response among <b>circulating</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> These findings may be helpful for the design of new vaccines against TB, and the detection of HBHA-specific T cells at the site of the infection may be a promising tool for the rapid diagnosis of active TB.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{determined}} {{whether the}} decrease in lymphocytes after surgery is related to apoptosis. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Surgery induces a profound but transient depletion of <b>circulating</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unclear. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 18 patients before and after elective surgery and studied for morphologic and biochemical markers of apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, and Fas expression. RESULTS: The DNA staining of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} obtained after surgery, which had been cultured for 24 hours in vitro, showed chromatin condensation and fragmentation of cells into collapsed spheres. Moreover, DNA isolated from these peripheral blood mononuclear cells formed a ladder of oligonucleosomal fragments. However, peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained before surgery showed neither of these changes. The observation that none of these apoptotic cells ingested latex suggested that they were of lymphocytic origin. Fas-positive lymphocytes increased significantly 2 hours after the start of surgery and returned to preoperative levels by postoperative day 7. Anti-Fas antibody augmented apoptosis, whereas ZB 4, a Fas antagonist, inhibited apoptosis in lymphocytes after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that <b>circulating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in the early perioperative period are susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis, which may cause depletion of <b>circulating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> after surgery...|$|R
