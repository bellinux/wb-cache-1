30|$|The {{realization}} of prognostic lays {{foundation of the}} extraction of effective features. However, the fault information in one-channel vibration signal is incomplete. The effective way to obtain accurate failure information is to make fusion of multi-channel vibration signals for extracting appropriate features (Safizadeh and Latifi 2014). As a novel spectrum analysis algorithm proposed recently, composite spectrum (CS) is able to realize information fusion of various signals by calculating <b>correlative</b> <b>index</b> and mutual power spectrum of neighboring signals (Elbhbah and Sinha 2013). It can effectively restrain noises, and obtain sensitive feature information of signals simultaneously (Akilu et al. 2014). Considering the structural characters of hydraulic pumps, some modification is made on the CS algorithm in this paper to improve feature sensitivity.|$|E
40|$|This letter {{presents}} a novel spatial feature called object <b>correlative</b> <b>index</b> (OCI) {{to enhance the}} classification of very high resolution images. This novel method considers the property of an image object based on spectral similarity to construct a useful OCI to describe the spatial information objectively. Compared with the generic features widely used in image classification, the classification approach based on the OCI spatial feature results in higher classification accuracy than those approaches that only consider spectral features or pixelwise spatial features, such as the pixel shape index and mathematical morphology profiles. Experiments are conducted on QuickBird satellite image and aerial photo data, and results confirm that the proposed method is feasible and effective.

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} new {{comprehensive}} evaluation method with principal component reduction and catastrophe progression method, considering the complexity, hierarchy, contradiction, and {{relevance of the}} factors in sortie generation of carrier aircrafts. First of all, the index system of sortie generation capacity is ascertained, which contains <b>correlative</b> <b>indexes.</b> The principal component reduction method is applied to transform the <b>correlative</b> <b>indexes</b> into independent indexes. This method eliminates the effect of correlativity among indexes. The principal components are determined with their contributions. Then the reduced principal components are evaluated in catastrophe progression method. This method is easy to realize without weights, which is more objective. In fact, catastrophe progression method is a multidimensional fuzzy membership function, which is suitable for the incompatible multiobjective evaluation. Thus, a two-level evaluation method for sortie generation capacity of carrier aircrafts is realized with principal component reduction and catastrophe progression method. Finally, the Surge operation of aircraft carrier “Nimitz” is taken as an example to evaluate the sortie generation capacity. The results of the proposed method are {{compared with those of}} Analytic Hierarchy Process, which verify the usefulness and reliability of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|Axillary {{meristem}} {{production and}} activity {{contribute to the}} high plasticity of plant development which allows plants to respond to environmental changes. Branches arise from axillary buds that form in the leaf axil. These buds may remain dormant, or may grow out to form branches immediately. Alternatively, the axillary buds may also persist in a dormant state for an indefinite period of time until appropriate signals permit outgrowth to commence. Branching is regulated by phytohormones, including auxin acting via the polar auxin transport stream, and locally within the bud {{by the action of}} branching integrators like BRC 1 and MAX 2. Branchingis also regulated by environmental factors such as competition signals (low Red light: Far-Red light [R: FR]) that inhibit bud outgrowth. Our recent studies indicate that ABA acts within the bud tosuppress outgrowth. NCED 3 is a key enzyme in the ABA biosynthesis pathway, and ABA 2 is another importantABA biosynthesisgene. ABA accumulatedtosignificantly higher levels in lower, more dormantbudscompared to less dormant buds at higher rosette positions. Additionally, bud ABA content and the <b>correlative</b> inhibition <b>index,</b> whichis a measure of systemic branching suppression, were increased in plants grown under low R:FR compared to those grown under high R:FR. Under low R:FR the NCED 3 deficient mutantnced 3 - 2 and the ABA 2 deficient mutant aba 2 - 1 had significantly more branches and lower <b>correlative</b> inhibition <b>index</b> thanWT. The results indicate that the suppression of branching by low R:FR may be mediated, at least in part, by elevated levels of ABA in the buds...|$|R
40|$|There is {{conflicting}} evidence regarding whether calcium-permeable receptors are removed during group I mGluR-mediated synaptic depression. In {{support of this}} hypothesis, AMPAR rectification, a <b>correlative</b> <b>index</b> of the synaptic expression of GluA 2 -lacking calcium–permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs), is known to decrease after the induction of several types of group I mGluR-mediated long-term depression (LTD), suggesting that {{a significant proportion of}} synaptic CP-AMPARs is removed during synaptic depression. We have previously demonstrated that fear conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation in the lateral amygdala is reversed by group 1 mGluR-mediated depotentiation. Here, we examined whether CP-AMPARs are removed by mGluR 1 -mediated depotentiation of fear conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation. The synaptic expression of CP-AMPARs was negligible before, increased significantly 12 hrs after, and returned to baseline 48 hrs after fear conditioning, as evidenced by the changes in the sensitivity of lateral amygdala synaptic responses to NASPM. Importantly, the sensitivity to NASPM was not altered after induction of depotentiation. Our findings, together with previous results, suggest that the removal of CP-AMPARs is not required for the depotentiation of fear conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation at lateral amygdala synapses...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Mental {{health is}} an {{important}} part of individual, social and occupational life. World Health Organization defines mental health as absolute ability of performing social, physical and mental roles. Inattention to mental health is one of the important factors that lowers efficacy, uses up human powers, causes physical and mental complications and job exhaustion, especially in professional services. As health personnel is major part of health services and their high job incentive is a necessity for their health insurance, this research was implemented to assess their mental health quality. Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional, correlative study which is conducted on 190 health personnel. The questionnaire consisted of two parts: Demographic characteristics and Goldenberg general health questionnaire- 28 data analysis was performed by using SPSS and statistical methods were independent samples t-test, chi-square, one-way ANOVA and Pearson <b>correlative</b> <b>index.</b> Results: Two-third of cases were female, mean age was 32. 22. 76. 3 % were married, 49. 5 % had no child, and most of the others had one child. 32. 2 % of cases had mental disorders (score > 23). Conclusion: Mean score of cases was 21, this score comparing with the general population of Iran is high. Mental health of health personnel for many reasons is at risk. According to these findings, great stressors of such jobs are: Facing with unexpected situations, work turns, especially night turns, organizational and individual factors...|$|E
40|$|Land cover {{classification}} using {{very high}} spatial resolution (VHSR) imaging plays {{a very important}} role in remote sensing applications. However, image noise usually reduces the classification accuracy of VHSR images. Image spatial filters have been recently adopted to improve VHSR image land cover classification. In this study, a new object-based image filter using topology and feature constraints is proposed, where an object is considered as a central object and has irregular shapes and various numbers of neighbors depending {{on the nature of the}} surroundings. First, multi-scale segmentation is used to generate a homogeneous image object and extract the corresponding vectors. Then, topology and feature constraints are proposed to select the adjacent objects, which present similar materials to the central object. Third, the feature of the central object is smoothed by the average of the selected objects’ feature. This proposed approach is validated on three VHSR images, ranging from a fixed-wing aerial image to UAV images. The performance of the proposed approach is compared to a standard object-based approach (OO), object <b>correlative</b> <b>index</b> (OCI) spatial feature based method, a recursive filter (RF), and a rolling guided filter (RGF), and has shown a 6 %– 18 % improvement in overall accuracy.

Uma alternativa à radiologia para caracterização da densidade mineral óssea pode ser através de índices correlativos, como o Osteorisk, de fácil acesso e baixo custo, que auxilia o médico na solicitação da Densitometria Óssea. Por considerarmos que a osteoporose pode interferir na evolução e no tratamento da EIA fomos motivados a realizar este estudo. Nosso objetivo foi avaliar subjetivamente a densidade mineral óssea através do índice Osteorisk em pacientes portadores de EIA. MÉTODOS: Foram avaliados pacientes saudáveis, (grupo controle, n= 30) e pacientes com EIA (n= 30), dos quais obtivemos idade, peso e altura, sendo estabelecido o Osteorisk.

40|$|Global marine fish catch {{has been}} stable {{over the past}} decade but the clupeoid {{contribution}} has declined from one-half to one-third of the marine fish catch. This decline appears to be caused by changes in recruitment success during heavy fishing pressure. Theoretical population approaches and <b>correlative</b> environmental <b>indices</b> are not yet sufficient for setting catch limits. For some time the direct measurement of current biomass appears to be necessary for setting clupeoid quotas. Precision and cost studies on the estimation of biomass with current methods indicate that a standard error of estimate less than 25 % cannot be justified based on the increased long-term yield of the stock. Assembly of a prospective life-table for the central subpopulation of the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) allows the discussion of intra-population and environmental controls on growth of the population. Using reasonable values for survival and growth in the embryonic, larval, and juvenile stages {{in the context of a}} life-table allows one to evaluate the stages where recruitment is controlled. From this manipulation it appears that significant decreases in recruitment could originate at any stage but marked increases in recruitment are only likely to arise from lower mortality rates in the embryonic and larval stages. The late larval stage of the anchovy could exhibit remarkable control on the level of recruitment through plasticity of the inter-action between growth rate and survival. Maximum cohort biomass of the anchovy occurs late in the firs...|$|R
40|$|The {{plumpness}} is {{an important}} index of crop seed. However, traditional measurements are time-consuming and labor intensive. The computer vision technology, which may offer more efficient and non-destructive methods for measurement, has recently appeared. But {{it is very difficult}} to accurately estimate the plumpness of single seed by the ratio between area and perimeter because of the diversity of rapeseed seed’s size. This paper focused on rapeseed seed plumpness recognition and quantification, based on computer vision. A new method, the coefficient of variation of radius (CVR), was used to estimate seed plumpness. The recognition and quantification model for plumpness in single seed were established by using the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering and fuzzy math method. The plumpness of the seed is full if plumpness is greater than or equal to 0. 6. Some <b>correlative</b> <b>index</b> are calculated and analyzed to verify the validity of this method. The tests show that there is no correlation between plumpness or plumpness ratio, and 1000 -seed weight or equivalence diameter. But there are significantly partial correlation between plumpness or plumpness ratio, 1000 -seed weight and equivalence diameter. Finally, plumpness ratio index is significantly different among the 12 varieties rapeseed was determined. With the mean value of plumpness ratio of rapeseed variety, the plumpness degree was plotted 10 grades. The results show that the application of computer vision technology is significantly valid for quantitative determination of plumpness in rapeseed seed. </span...|$|E

Totally 218 color samples were evaluated by 70 subjects based on 12 basic descriptive variables including "warm - cool," "weak-strong," and "dynamic-passive. " By using factor analysis, these 12 variables were split into two orthogonal factors (activity index and potency <b>index)</b> and one <b>correlative</b> factor (definition <b>index),</b> which {{may be used for}} description of color emotion. Based on these three indexes, a color emotion map in CIELCH color space was obtained by cluster analysis. A well-regulated distribution of human's emotion was observed in CIE L*C* plane with a neutral feeling region around the Point of chroma C*= 30. 5 and lightness L*= 53. 3. Colors scattered at opposite direction of this neutral region possess the opposite feelings. The detailed relationship between color emotion indexes and color perception attributes, i. e., hue, lightness, and chroma, were further studied by correlation analysis and graphical representation. The results indicated that the activity index was dependent on chroma, the potency index was dependent on lightness, and the definition index was dependent on both chroma and lightness. It was also observed that the influence of hue on emotional response was not as significant as those in previous studies even for the variable "warm - cool.
