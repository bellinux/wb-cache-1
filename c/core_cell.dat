40|$|Apoptosis is an {{essential}} step in cavitation during embryonic epithelial morphogenesis, but its mechanisms are largely unknown. In this paper, we used embryonic stem cell-differentiated embryoid bodies (EBs) as a model and found that Bnip 3 (Bcl- 2 /adenovirus E 1 B 19 -kD interacting protein), a BH 3 -only proapoptotic protein, was highly up-regulated during cavitation in a hypoxia-dependent manner. Short hairpin RNA silencing of Bnip 3 inhibited apoptosis of the <b>core</b> <b>cells</b> and delayed cavitation. We show that the Bnip 3 up-regulation was mediated mainly by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - 2. Ablation of HIF- 2 α or HIF- 1 β, the common β subunit of HIF- 1 and - 2, suppressed Bnip 3 up-regulation and inhibited apoptosis and cavitation. We further show that apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) cooperated with Bnip 3 to promote lumen clearance. Bnip 3 silencing in AIF-null EBs nearly blocked apoptosis and cavitation. Moreover, AIF also regulated Bnip 3 expression through mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species and consequent HIF- 2 α stabilization. These results uncover a mechanism of cavitation through hypoxia-induced apoptosis of the <b>core</b> <b>cells</b> mediated by HIFs, Bnip 3, and AIF. status: publishe...|$|R

S. ] - Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringThe {{compressive}} {{residual strength}} {{and behavior of}} impact damaged sandwich panels are governed {{by the amount of}} non-visible core damage underneath the facesheets. The failure modes under in-plane compressive loading are either due to crack precipitation from the damage zone or unstable dimple propagation across the width. In both cases, the local bending of facesheet (dimple) triggers the final failure sequence. Thus, containment of this local bending by reinforcing the <b>core</b> <b>cell(s)</b> in the damage region will mitigate the failure initiation and thus increase residual properties. A repair technique involving the containment of local bending of sandwich facesheet by strategically filling honeycomb <b>core</b> <b>cells</b> has been explored to improve the damage tolerance of impact damaged sandwich panels. The experimental results indicate that filling honeycomb cells {{at the center of the}} damage region in addition to those at the edge of the damage region produces the maximum benefit.

Of 14 thus far analyzed, three were cellular genetic mosaics with substantial contributions of tumor-derived cells in many developmentally unrelated tissues, including some never seen in the solid tumors that form in transplant hosts. The tissues functioned normally and synthesized their specific products (e. g., immunoglobulins, adult hemoglobin, liver proteins) coded for by strain-type alleles at known loci. In addition, a tumor-contributed color gene, steel, not previously known to be present in the carcinoma cells, was detected from the coat phenotype. Cells derived from the carcinoma, which is of X/Y sex chromosome constitution, also contributed to the germ line and formed reproductively functional sperms, some of which transmitted the steel gene to the progeny. Thus, after almost 200 transplant generations as a highly malignant tumor, embryoid body <b>core</b> <b>cells</b> appear to be developmentally totipotent and able to express, in an orderly sequence in differentiation of somatic and germ-line tissues, many genes hitherto silent in the tumor of origin.

40|$|AbstractGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is {{the most}} {{frequent}} and most aggressive brain tumor in adults. The dismal prognosis is due to postsurgery recurrences arising from escaped invasive tumor cells. The signaling pathways activated in invasive cells are under investigation, and models are currently designed in search for therapeutic targets. We developed here an in vivo model of human invasive GBM in mouse brain from a GBM cell line with moderate tumorigenicity that allowed simultaneous primary tumor growth and dispersal of tumor cells in the brain parenchyma. This strategy allowed {{for the first time}} the isolation and characterization of matched sets of tumor mass (Core) and invasive (Inv) cells. Both cell populations, but more markedly Inv cells, acquired stem cell markers, neurosphere renewal ability, and resistance to rapamycin-induced apoptosis relative to parental cells. The comparative phenotypic analysis between Inv and <b>Core</b> <b>cells</b> showed significantly increased tumorigenicity in vivo and increased invasion with decreased proliferation in vitro for Inv cells. Examination of a large array of signaling pathways revealed extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) down-modulation and Akt activation in Inv cells and an opposite profile in <b>Core</b> <b>cells.</b> Akt activation correlated with the increased tumorigenicity, stemness, and invasiveness, whereas Erk activation correlated with the proliferation of the cells.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the frog}} embryo, a {{sub-population}} of trunk neural crest (NC) cells undergoes a dorsal route of migration {{to contribute to}} the mesenchyme in the core of the dorsal fin. Here we show that a second population of cells, originally located in the dorsomedial region of the somite, also contributes to the fin mesenchyme. We find that the frog orthologue of Wnt 11 (Wnt 11 -R) is expressed in both the NC and somite cell populations that migrate into the fin matrix. Wnt 11 -R is expressed prior to migration and persists in the mesenchymal cells after they have distributed throughout the fin. Loss of function studies demonstrate that Wnt 11 -R activity is required for an epithelial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT) event that precedes migration of cells into the fin matrix. In Wnt 11 -R depleted embryos, the absence of fin <b>core</b> <b>cells</b> leads to defective dorsal fin development and to collapse of the fin structure. Experiments using small molecule inhibitors indicate that dorsal migration of fin <b>core</b> <b>cells</b> depends on calcium signaling through calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). In Wnt 11 -R depleted embryos, normal migration of NC cells and dorsal somite cells into the fin and normal fin development can be rescued by stimulation of calcium release. These studies are consistent with a model in which Wnt 11 -R signaling, via a downstream calcium pathway, regulates fin cell migration and, more generally, indicates a role for non-canonical Wnt signaling in regulation of EMT...|$|R
