Once a conflict is over, {{the criminal justice system}} of the affected country should ideally hold accountable those responsible for <b>core</b> international <b>crimes.</b> Often, the number of crimes is so high that the criminal justice system simply cannot address all of them through regular criminal procedure. This results in a backlog of such cases within the system. This thesis examines the prospect for introduction of an abbreviated criminal procedure for <b>core</b> international <b>crimes</b> and arrives at a set of components and principles under which such procedure may be developed.

40|$|This thesis {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that a gap exists between the universal consensus among all States regarding the criminalisation of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes on the one hand, and the prevalence of impunity on the other. It then puts forward the hypothesis that this gap {{may be explained by}} the unsuitability of the approach taken by the international community {{to address the issue of}} responsibility for <b>core</b> international <b>crimes.</b> In order to test this hypothesis, this thesis critically examines the different forms of responsibility for <b>core</b> international <b>crimes</b> available in International Law. One of the important characteristics that distinguish <b>core</b> international <b>crimes</b> from other international crimes or ordinary crimes is that they are often committed with the simultaneous participation of several actors, including individual perpetrators, the State and, in some instances, non-state actors. Addressing the impunity for the commission of <b>core</b> international <b>crimes</b> cannot, therefore, be limited to the lack of consequences for individual perpetrators. This thesis challenges the focus of International Criminal Justice on individual criminal responsibility and argues for a comprehensive approach to responsibility for international crimes, including State and collective responsibility, in order to convey the collective and political features of these crimes. The issue of responsibility for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes has been widely discussed in the scholarly literature, in particular with the development of International Criminal Law. One can observe, however, an imbalance between the amount of research dedicated to the issue of individual criminal responsibility for <b>core</b> international <b>crimes</b> and the issue of State responsibility for international crimes. This imbalance is partly due to the fact that the notion of State criminal responsibility was rejected by a large majority of States, and discussions on these issues were abandoned. The originality of this thesis comes from the broad approach it adopts to examine the issue of responsibility for <b>core</b> international <b>crimes</b> with the aim of bridging the gap between the distinct academic perspectives. It weaves together different approaches to responsibility, from individual responsibility to State responsibility, in order to identify the weaknesses of the current forms of responsibility and to highlight the complementary aspects of the main questions discussed in these different fields of law. The thesis goes beyond highlighting the complementary aspects of the different forms of responsibility for <b>core</b> international <b>crimes</b> and puts forward a concrete proposal to develop a comprehensive normative framework, based on the model of the Responsibility to Protect concept, to implement a comprehensive approach to responsibility. This framework relies on the emergence of a duty to end impunity that lies with the territorial State as well as the international community. The purpose of this comprehensive normative framework is to promote the cooperation and interactions between the different mechanisms available in International Law and designed to deal with issues of responsibility for <b>core</b> international <b>crimes.</b> The proposal is based on the assumption that including the different norms and measures which aim to end impunity within one framework would optimise their synergy to respond to <b>core</b> international <b>crimes</b> and protect the interests of humanity as a whole...|$|R

To this effect, it analyses the regime determined under treaty law, customary law and {{general principles of law}} for the prosecution of <b>core</b> <b>crimes.</b> It examines whether the prohibition to commit <b>core</b> <b>crimes</b> embodies jus cogens and, if so, what consequences derive therefrom for the duty to prosecute perpetrators. Further, considering that the ICC was established in order to fill in lacunae of accountability derived from States’ unwillingness or inability to prosecute, the thesis scrutinizes the jurisdictional framework established by the Statute, in particular the principle of complementarity. On the basis of the study undertaken, it is argued that complementarity as determined in the Rome Statute is a specific materialization of a broader concept of complementarity. The thesis concludes that <b>core</b> <b>crimes</b> law has been motioned forth by the principle of substantive complementarity, which binds the custodial State to prosecute, where extradition is not feasible and international jurisdiction cannot step in, if necessary on grounds of universal jurisdiction. Finally, taking into account that the Statute of Rome articulates the mandate of the Court with the authority of the SC to maintain international peace and security, the thesis proposes a model of coordination of the competences of States, the ICC and the UN political organ, in accordance with the law of the Charter, the Rome Statute and peremptory norms of the international community. Against this backdrop, a systematic framework of the duty to prosecute <b>core</b> <b>crimes</b> is submitted, such that sovereignty and the principle mandating the fight against impunity are operatively reconciled...|$|E

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMOn 17 July 1998, a {{total of}} 120 States, {{including}} Malawi, voted for {{the adoption of the}} Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The ermanent ICC became operational on 1 July 2002. The ICC has jurisdiction over the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.

The ICC operates under the principle of complementarity, which entails that the ICC will only assume jurisdiction over these <b>core</b> <b>crimes</b> in the event that a State Party is unwilling and unable genuinely to carry out the investigation and prosecution.

Given {{that there}} is already {{quite a lot of}} {{literature}} on UJ, it is important to focus the research on the issue of fragmentation and/or unity rather than {{to deal with the issue}} of UJ more generally. I will focus on this topic in sections 1 and 2, explaining some cursory remarks to these issues in my analysis on fragmentation. In the introduction, I will briefly introduce UJ as a controversial form of jurisdiction, but still necessary given that territorial jurisdiction does not always function well in the case of international crime. I will demonstrate that many state parties to the International Criminal Court (ICC) Statute have vested or reconfirmed UJ for the <b>core</b> <b>crimes</b> when implementing the ICC Statute. The leading question of my research is whether this practice has led or has the potential to lead to unity or rather to fragmentation within ICL. In the research I will approach this question from different perspectives. In section 1 I will examine how State parties have may actually enacted universal jurisdiction for the <b>core</b> <b>crimes,</b> with a view to determining whether there is indeed some unity on this front or whether the practice on this matter is actually rather diverse (or fragmented). Subsequently, I will analyse which conditions States have formulated for the exercise of UJ, and whether this practice is consistent (unity) or again rather diverse (fragmentation). It might also be interesting to see whether States have different conditions for UJ over <b>core</b> <b>crimes</b> than over other international or transnational crimes, which would be a sign of real fragmentation between modern ICL (the <b>core</b> <b>crimes)</b> and transnational ICL (crimes such as terrorism, piracy, money counterfeiting, etc.). In section 2, on the basis of a few selected case studies, I will ask whether the exercise of UJ has the tendency to lead to fragmented jurisprudence on substantive ICL. I will try to answer: Do States in their implementation of legislation and subsequently the national courts use the same crime definitions as the ICC, or are they generally different and tailored to domestic circumstances? And those questions arise even more strongly for modes of liability? If the latter is the case, to what extent is the jurisprudence fragmented – is it on minor points, or do we see great divergences in case law on crime definitions? Finally, I will make some final observations on the utility of UJ and whether in general it will lead to further fragmentation within ICL, with my personal interpretation of ideal UJ...|$|E
40|$|Armed {{conflicts}} with many <b>core</b> international <b>crimes</b> committed entail many suspects. There are nearly 2000 opened war crimes cases, including almost 10, 000 suspects in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) {{as a result}} of the war which lasted from 1992 to 1995. Since the ICTY was created to try only those who are the most responsible, the majority of cases were left to the BiH national authorities. In order to systematically and responsibly address this issue, the National War Crimes Strategy was adopted in 2008, with the aim to prevent the impunity and prosecute all or at least most of the perpetrators in 15 years from the adoption of the Strategy. It incorporates the case selection and prioritization criteria which should be used when deciding on the case complexity thereby helping prosecutors and judges to find an appropriate forum for trying a specific case and giving the priority to a certain case if its complexity so requires. The essence of the criteria later became part of the Criminal Procedure Code of BiH and allowed for their direct application in criminal proceedings.

40|$|The {{relatively}} young, albeit dynamic, {{field of}} international criminal law, spawned by {{the proliferation of}} international criminal courts and tribunals {{over the last two}} decades, has yet to consolidate its theoretical contours, in particular with respect to the clarification of major substantive law concepts. The doctrine of mens rea is among the fundamental concepts that ought to be clearly defined and construed for <b>core</b> international <b>crimes</b> such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. With no general definition of mens rea in either the Charter of the International Military Tribunal (known as the Nuremberg Charter), the Statutes of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), or the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), only the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) introduced a comprehensive legal provision on the mental element of a crime. The judges of the Court breathed life in Article 30 of the Statute in its early jurisprudence. In broad terms, mens rea is a state of guilty mind that a person entertains while committing a crime. It is the one of the most fundamental doctrines in criminal law, be it national or international, since the absence of mens rea {{on the part of a}} perpetrator while committing a crime precludes the attribution of criminal responsibility. Although the law on mens rea in international criminal law takes inspiration from the laws and jurisprudence of common and continental law jurisdictions, the gravity, magnitude, and complexity of <b>core</b> international <b>crimes</b> impose an obligation to carefully consider how various mens rea standards are applied and construed in the international law context...|$|R
40|$|The present {{analysis}} {{deals with}} the question of whether and to what extent mental attitudes that, at the level of cognition, do not attain the factual threshold of awareness of the criminal outcome as a practical certainty can lead to the establishment of criminal responsibility for the so-called <b>core</b> <b>crimes,</b> i. e. genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The answer to this issue depends on whether and how far a given system of criminal law views the mental element applicable to the offences in question as encompassing forms of risk-taking. Seeking to comprehensively investigate the current legal situation, the present study examines the types of mental element applicable under two domestic legislations on <b>core</b> <b>crimes,</b> namely the German Völkerstrafgesetzbuch and the U. S. Federal Criminal Code, on the one hand, and in customary international law and under the ICC Statute, on the other hand. The survey turns then to whether in any of the legal systems at stake a standard of mental element has been consolidated such that it would be generally applicable unless otherwise provided. It also explores the extent to which mental attitudes departing from the threshold of awareness of the criminal outcome as a practical certainty may establish criminal responsibility for specific crimes and modes of liability. The rules thereby identified are applied to model cases describing various situations where an individual accomplishes an act of relevance to the criminal law but does not clearly perceive the consequence that will ensue from her behaviour. From the present study it emerges that there appear to exist more divergences than commonalities in the current legal landscape, regarding whether and to what extent the sphere of criminal responsibility for <b>core</b> <b>crimes</b> may be linked to attitudes of risk-taking. This outcome seems to derive first and foremost from the differing definitions of intent as they have developed in the regulatory frameworks analysed in this work. The conscious adoption of a behaviour that might lead to the realisation of an offence that is not aimed at, can under certain conditions be covered by the notion of intent found in German criminal law and in the jurisprudence of the ICTY and ICTR applying customary international law. On the other hand, it is excluded from the definition of the intent in U. S. federal criminal law and in the ICC Statute. Furthermore, in all the legal systems considered in the present study, there exist significant exceptions to the application of intent, both widening and narrowing the scope of criminal responsibility. Considering that in a decentralized system of international justice the intervention of the ICC should be an extrema ratio, the present analysis suggests establishing a regulation to be applied by the International Criminal Court on the mental element, which reflects the gravity of cases this tribunal is called upon to adjudicate. At the same time lesser degrees of mens rea would remain applicable under national laws on <b>core</b> <b>crimes.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The African {{continent}} {{has been}} consistent in placing its concerns regarding {{the manner in}} which international criminal justice is administered on the international platform. For the past decade, the continent has minced no words about its misgivings concerning the use of universal jurisdiction (UJ) by both foreign States and the International Criminal Court (ICC). The African Union (AU) has been very supportive of UJ and its utility in fighting impunity and affording justice to victims of the <b>core</b> <b>crimes</b> of international law, namely, genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Often referred to as <b>core</b> <b>crimes,</b> these are regarded as customary law crimes which are an affront to entire humankind. These crimes were also codified by the Rome Statute of the ICC. However, the political and selective use of the principle of universality by foreign States to prosecute perpetrators of these crimes was seen as causing conflicts and undermining peace efforts, reconciliation and regional stability. As a result the African continent voiced its concerns at various public platforms, including {{under the auspices of the}} UN and it therefore called for reforms. This prompted the AU to produce its own model law on UJ, which African States could adapt to their own socio-political circumstances and legal context. The debates that ensued around UJ on the African continent offered African States a chance to contribute to the development of international law, especially on the rules concerning UJ. This paper analyses the interaction amongst African states that eventually led to the development of UJ regulations within their individual legal systems, and tries to determine if there is indeed an African signature in those legal rules...|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} of complementarity {{is the cornerstone}} of the establishment of the International Criminal Court as well as one of the key factors for its successful operation.   Having said that, the qualities of being flexible and adaptable make the task of interpreting the {{principle of}} complementarity extremely sensitive and technically tricky.   According to the current wording of the principle of complementarity in the Rome Statute, the ICC could factually exercise primacy over the national jurisdiction, if a loose interpretation of the principle is adopted, or conversely being residual to national jurisdictions, if the principle was strictly interpreted. While the principle of complementarity {{was at the heart of}} the negotiating process for the establishment of the International Criminal Court, the emerging practice of the Court to date has left the vast majority of the questions on complementarity unanswered, even the few issues which the Court has touched upon are not immune from criticism. This thesis will thus strive, through an in-depth analysis of the past, present and practice of the principle of complementarity and its corollary issues, to offer workable answers as well as constructive criticism.   Guided by the central objective of ending impunity for the <b>core</b> <b>crimes</b> through criminal justice, this thesis, in interpreting the principle of complementarity, will follow a balanced approach which, while unequivocally favours national prosecutions where possible, it adopts a broadening interpretation when national jurisdictions are genuinely unavailable or ineffective.   To this end, this thesis eventually presents the principle of complementarity as a managerial principle which promotes for the effective investigation and prosecution of the <b>core</b> <b>crimes</b> through the adoption of different policies which encourage, inter alia, a division of labour between the International Criminal Court and domestic jurisdictions, and enable states to carry out proceedings and overcome dilemmas of ‘inability’ or ‘unwillingness’ without the role of the International Criminal Court being limited in such incidents to excluding national jurisdiction.

Après quoi, afin de porter notre attention sur l’efficacité et la légitimité du principe de juridiction universelle, défini aussi comme une forme de juridiction controversée, on l’examinera dans les pays qui ont légiféré différemment en la matière. Dans la première partie du texte, on donnera un aperçu des Etats qui, par respect pour la ratification du Statut de Rome, ont résolu le problème de l’universalité de la juridiction en droit pénal selon différentes formes et modalités. Dans la deuxième partie, à travers quelques cas de jurisprudence, on essayera de répondre à la question suivante : les Etats, dans l’implémentation de leur propre législation et, par conséquent, leur tribunaux nationaux, utilisent-ils les mêmes définitions de crime employées par la Cour Pénale Internationale ? Ou, au contraire, adaptent-ils ces définitions aux circonstances nationales ? Pour conclure, l’auteur développera des considerations sur l’utilité de la juridiction universelle d’un point de vue de mondialisation sociologique...|$|E
40|$|Magister Legum - LLMIn {{the field}} of {{international}} law three <b>core</b> <b>crimes</b> generally make up the jurisdiction of international criminal tribunals: war crimes; genocide; and crimes against humanity. Only two of these crimes (war crimes and genocide) {{are the subject of}} a global convention that requires States to prevent and punish such conduct and to cooperate among themselves toward those ends. By contrast, there is no such convention dedicated to preventing and punishing crimes against humanity. An international convention on prevention, punishment and inter-State cooperation with respect to crimes against humanity appears to be a key missing piece in the current framework of international law. The offence of crimes against humanity is a jus cogens and there is an erga omnes for states to prosecute and extradite offenders of crimes against humanity. This can be achieved by having international obligations founded on a specialised convention...|$|E
40|$|Investigating {{the nature}} of criminality, {{particularly}} {{in the context of}} ICC <b>core</b> <b>crimes,</b> seems fundamental in a quest to discover the truth and produce an accurate historical record; both of these aims are in the long term interests of justice, the inter-national as well as local communities. Whilst the ICC is based on strong punitive ideals, similar to those endorsed by ICTY and ICTR in particular, the ICC is {{in a unique position to}} depart from a merely pragmatic/administrative exploration of facts and history. In fact, in recent prosecutions rehabilitation aims have frequently been substituted with an “attempt to stigmatise the most serious violations of international humanitarian law. ” 1 The results orientated approach of ICTY/ICTR, which includes, inter alia, charge bargaining in alleged genocide cases, should be departed from in ICC proceedings in favour of more holistic and interdisciplinary justice methods which strive to not only achieve punitive goals but also promote rehabilitation of of-fenders and ultimately reconciliation...|$|E
40|$|This study explores rural U. S. crime {{patterns}} {{with a focus}} on social capital. We use a triangulation of three <b>core</b> theories of <b>crime</b> including social disorganization, anomie/strain, and rational choice theories to develop a formal theory and an empirical framework. The role of four unique measures of social capital is explored in understanding patterns of rural crime using nonmetropolitan U. S. county data. The empirical results generally support the theoretical predictions and conclude that rural communities that pursue economic growth and development must be prepared to address the resulting upward pressures on crime. The results on social capital and crime provide numerous policy insights for rural communities. Copyright (c) 2010 Copyright the Authors.

The Nuremberg Trials are considered a breakthrough for the principle that, for a <b>core</b> set of <b>crimes,</b> there is no immunity from prosecution. For the first time the representatives of a sovereign state were held accountable for their actions. In autumn 1946, the Free State of Bavaria was reconstituted with the enactment of the Bavarian Constitution.|$|R
40|$|LL. M. (International Law) The {{establishment}} of the International Criminal Court (ICC), through the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC/Rome Statute) is proof {{that there is a}} general acceptance that leaders who act as aggressors and violate recognized human rights should face international criminal justice at the ICC. To achieve the ideals of the Rome Statute, the Office of the Prosecutor was established to act as a fore-runner and a bridge to victims of the <b>core</b> international <b>crimes</b> established by the statute, to have access to international justice. The prosecutor while investigating and prosecuting the ‘core’ international crimes is expected to be independent and avoid undue influence. Furthermore, the prosecutor has to be seen to be acting without fear or fear in the execution of his duties in order for the ICC’s establishment not to be perceived as a futile exercise. He or she also has to guard against disrespecting the fiercely protected sovereignty of states, be they party to the Rome Statute or not, as states {{play a major role in}} the execution of the prosecutor’s requests to the court through cooperating with it. The prosecutorial discretion to choose which situation to investigate and which senior official to prosecute is a very sensitive task, with major political implications as the court’s authority has not been universally accepted. In order to balance the prosecutorial independence and his not acting without control various principles and concepts were incorporated into the Rome Statute. They include the complementarity rule, the jurisdiction of the court, admissibility and cooperation with the court; which will form the basis through which the role and function of the prosecutor shall be discussed to analyze if indeed he is independent...|$|R
