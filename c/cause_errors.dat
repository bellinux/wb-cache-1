5|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{confusion}} and ambiguity in the creation–evolution debate {{is the definition of}} evolution itself. In the context of biology, evolution is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also has a number of different meanings in different fields, from evolutionary computation to molecular evolution to sociocultural evolution to stellar and galactic evolution. When biological evolution is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can <b>cause</b> <b>errors</b> such as the claim that modern evolutionary theory says anything about abiogenesis or the Big Bang.|$|E

It uses the intersection algorithm, {{a modified version of}} Marzullo's algorithm, to select accurate time servers and is designed to mitigate the effects of variable network latency. NTP can usually maintain time to within tens of milliseconds over the public Internet, and can achieve better than one millisecond accuracy in local area networks under ideal conditions.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to DNA damage, a mutation {{is a change}} in the base sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce. Although distinctly different from each other, DNA damages and mutations are related because DNA damages often <b>cause</b> <b>errors</b> of DNA synthesis during replication or repair and these errors are a major source of mutation.|$|E
25|$|Lucilia cuprina {{is one of}} {{many species}} of the family Calliphoridae. Though many of its species have similar characteristics, L. cuprina’s closest {{relative}} is its sister species, Lucilia sericata. These flies are very similar in appearance and morphological characteristics, which can sometimes <b>cause</b> <b>errors</b> when trying to differentiate between them. They each exhibit specific genetic variations which can be distinguished by using random amplified polymorphic DNA and/or mitochondrial DNA sequences, and are known to cause myiasis (flystrike) in sheep. They are both one of the first blow flies to arrive at a corpse and each have smooth larva. Unlike L. cuprina, L. sericata does not usually infest live sheep. L. cuprina is a worldwide sheep pest though it is usually found in dry climates. L. sericata has a coastal distribution.|$|E

25|$|Changes in DNA {{caused by}} {{mutation}} can <b>cause</b> <b>errors</b> in protein sequence, creating partially or completely non-functional proteins. Each cell, {{in order to}} function correctly, depends on thousands of proteins to function {{in the right places}} at the right times. When a mutation alters a protein that plays a critical role in the body, a medical condition can result. Some mutations alter a gene's DNA base sequence but do not change the function of the protein made by the gene. One study on the comparison of genes between different species of Drosophila suggests that if a mutation does change a protein, this will probably be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial. Studies have shown that only 7% of point mutations in noncoding DNA of yeast are deleterious and 12% in coding DNA are deleterious. The rest of the mutations are either neutral or slightly beneficial.|$|E
500|$|Damage to the {{cerebellum}} often causes motor-related symptoms, {{the details}} of which depend {{on the part of}} the cerebellum involved and how it is damaged. Damage to the [...] flocculonodular lobe may show up as a loss of equilibrium and in particular an altered, irregular walking gait, with a wide stance caused by difficulty in balancing. Damage to the lateral zone typically causes problems in skilled voluntary and planned movements which can <b>cause</b> <b>errors</b> in the force, direction, speed and amplitude of movements. Other manifestations include hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), dysarthria (problems with speech articulation), dysmetria (problems judging distances or ranges of movement), dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid alternating movements such as walking), impaired check reflex or rebound phenomenon, and intention tremor (involuntary movement caused by alternating contractions of opposing muscle groups). Damage to the midline portion may disrupt whole-body movements, whereas damage localized more laterally is more likely to disrupt fine movements of the hands or limbs. Damage to the upper part of the cerebellum tends to cause gait impairments and other problems with leg coordination; damage to the lower part is more likely to cause uncoordinated or poorly aimed movements of the arms and hands, as well as difficulties in speed. This complex of motor symptoms is called ataxia.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRho family GTPases {{are ideal}} {{candidates}} to regulate aspects of cytoskeletal dynamics downstream of axon guidance receptors. To examine the in vivo role of Rho GTPases in midline guidance, dominant negative (dn) and constitutively active (ct) forms of Rho, Drac 1, and Dcdc 42 {{are expressed in}} the Drosophila CNS. When expressed alone, only ctDrac and ctDcdc 42 cause axons in the pCC/MP 2 pathway to cross the midline inappropriately. Heterozygous loss of Roundabout enhances the ctDrac phenotype and <b>causes</b> <b>errors</b> in embryos expressing dnRho or ctRho. Homozygous loss of Son-of-Sevenless (Sos) also enhances the ctDrac phenotype and <b>causes</b> <b>errors</b> in embryos expressing either dnRho or dnDrac. CtRho suppresses the midline crossing <b>errors</b> <b>caused</b> by loss of Sos. CtDrac and ctDcdc 42 phenotypes are suppressed by heterozygous loss of Profilin, but strongly enhanced by coexpression of constitutively active myosin light chain kinase (ctMLCK), which increases myosin II activity. Expression of ctMLCK also <b>causes</b> <b>errors</b> in embryos expressing either dnRho or ctRho. Our data confirm that Rho family GTPases are required for regulation of actin polymerization and/or myosin activity {{and that this is}} critical for the response of growth cones to midline repulsive signals.
