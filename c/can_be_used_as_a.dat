5|$|Lanthanum {{fluoride}} is insoluble {{in water}} and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> qualitative test {{for the presence of}} La3+. The heavier halides are all very soluble deliquescent compounds. The anhydrous halides are produced by direct reaction of their elements, as heating the hydrates causes hydrolysis: for example, heating hydrated LaCl3 produces LaOCl.|$|E
5|$|Novelty deep-fried {{foods are}} popular today in American fairs, {{especially}} those in the American South. Hundreds of items are served at these fairs. Some of them include deep-fried beer, butter, and bubblegum. Additionally, deep frying <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of artwork by frying non-edible objects, such as electronics. Artists such as Henry Hargreaves have deep-fried replicas of electronic items such as iPads, Game Boys, and laptops.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium–uranium, {{with about}} 15–30mol.% plutonium, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors. Its {{pyrophoric}} nature and high {{susceptibility to corrosion}} {{to the point of}} self-igniting or disintegrating after exposure to air require alloying with other components. Addition of aluminium, carbon or copper does not improve disintegration rates markedly, zirconium and iron alloys have better corrosion resistance but they disintegrate in several months in air as well. Addition of titanium and/or zirconium significantly increases the melting point of the alloy.|$|E

30|$|This type of {{construction}} material production is applied in almost all types of lightweight concretes and <b>is</b> <b>used</b> in many fields at a mechanical level. According to the classification by the American Concrete Institute (ACI 2003), there are highly resistant concretes (Rc > 20  MPa) that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> structural materials, moderate-strength concrete with compressive strengths between 10 and 20  MPa that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> load-bearing elements, and low-strength concretes that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> beam filling for masonry.

5|$|Some {{ytterbium}} halides {{are used}} as reagents in organic synthesis. For example, ytterbium(III) chloride (YbCl3) is a Lewis acid and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> catalyst in the Aldol and Diels–Alder reactions. Ytterbium(II) iodide (YbI2) may be used, like samarium(II) iodide, as a reducing agent for coupling reactions.

5|$|The puffball bioaccumulates {{heavy metals}} {{present in the}} soil, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{bioindicator}} of soil pollution by heavy metals and selenium. In one 1977 study, samples collected from grassy areas near the side of an interstate highway in Connecticut were shown to have high concentrations of cadmium and lead. L.perlatum biomass has been shown experimentally to remove mercury ions from aqueous solutions, and is being investigated for potential use as a low-cost, renewable, biosorptive material {{in the treatment of}} water and wastewater containing mercury.|$|E
5|$|The {{seeds of}} {{radishes}} can be pressed to extract radish seed oil. Wild radish seeds contain up to 48% oil, and while {{not suitable for}} human consumption, this oil is a potential source of biofuel. The daikon grows well in cool climates and, apart from its industrial use, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cover crop, grown to increase soil fertility, to scavenge nutrients, suppress weeds, help alleviate soil compaction, and prevent winter erosion of the soil.|$|E
5|$|The slag melts in {{the heat}} of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and {{apertures}} in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately.
