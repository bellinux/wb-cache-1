40|$|In {{introduction}} author {{points to}} the necessity of adopting the institute <b>of</b> <b>confiscation</b> <b>of</b> criminal <b>assets,</b> supported by international experience, primarily due to the weakness of previously known institute <b>confiscation</b> <b>of</b> the proceeds of crime (for which the offender is being tried), showed {{in front of the}} phenomenon of organized crime. In doing so, he analyzes the modalities <b>of</b> <b>confiscation</b> <b>of</b> criminal origin present in modern legal systems and emphasizes the required standard of proof, as one of the key factors of their particularity. The following is a comparative review of the system for investigating and <b>confiscation</b> <b>of</b> criminal <b>assets</b> in Italy, Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, France and the United States. There are emphasized the normative elements which affect to scope of application of this institute, especially in light of its connection to the criminal proceedings, as well as jurisdiction to realization of the investigation process and procedure <b>of</b> <b>confiscation.</b> In the final part, the author concludes that appropriate social and institutional responses are very important for the effective fight against crime, every time if there is a suspicion about illegally acquired wealth. In doing so, particular attention arouses organized crime, particularly in the light of contemporary global trends, which, unfortunately, significantly affect the possibility of the development of organized crime, and development and/or covering up its financial component. In this sense, the author emphasizes that the basic characteristics of the system for investigation and <b>confiscation</b> <b>of</b> criminal <b>assets</b> connected to the criminal proceedings, which are used in developed European countries and the United States: (1) changed the rules of evidence, which means less convenient role of suspects, (2) the application of this mechanism to a limited number of crimes, which often includes drug trafficking and other serious crimes or organized crime, and (3) the existence of specialized subjects and investigative powers, which vary in relation to the classical powers related to the investigation of criminal offenses...|$|R

In 2011, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution condemning the collection by illegal means of the Eritrean 'diaspora tax', and in 2013, the Canadian government expelled the Eritrean consul for collecting the tax.

5000|$|Gell's year as High Sheriff was {{politically}} important {{because one of}} his duties was to raise the tax known as Ship Money, levied {{for the first time}} in 1635. Ship Money had previously been levied on coastal towns and its extension to inland areas caused resentment which contributed toward the gathering estrangement between Charles I and Parliament. In Derbyshire Gell set about raising the tax with a thoroughness which made him many personal enemies, especially among those of his own class, who paid the highest rates. Gell was ruthless in using [...] "distraint" [...] - <b>confiscation</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> - against non-payers, and succeeded in raising more for the king than subsequent sheriffs. Gell's record of service to the crown was rewarded by the grant of a baronetcy in 1642, after payments made on his behalf by his brother Thomas, in London, which included [...] "a warrant for a Baronett £300".|$|E

With a jury convinced of at least criminal negligence, Pearson was found guilty in 2011 on three counts, for making [...] "misleading, false or deceptive or reckless" [...] claims about the existence of the money. Barred from being a director for five years, he was also sentenced to a year in jail, but the SFO determined that <b>confiscation</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> from Pearson could not be made because he had been acquitted of dishonesty, had been sentenced for recklessness, and had lost money himself.|$|E
