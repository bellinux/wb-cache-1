40|$|The {{chemical}} and physical alterations of cadmium yellow (CdS) paints in Henri Matisse’s The Joy of Life (1905 – 1906, The Barnes Foundation) {{have been recognized}} since 2006, when a survey by portable X-ray fluorescence identified this pigment in all altered regions of the monumental painting. This alteration is visible as fading, discoloration, chalking, flaking, and spalling of several regions of light to medium yellow paint. Since that time, synchrotron radiation-based techniques including elemental and spectroscopic imaging, as well as X-ray scattering have been employed to locate and identify the alteration products observed in this and related works by Henri Matisse. This information is necessary to formulate one or multiple mechanisms for degradation of Matisse’s paints from this period, and thus ensure proper environmental conditions for the storage and the display of his works. This paper focuses on 2 D full-field X-ray Near Edge Structure imaging, 2 D micro-X-ray Diffraction, X-ray Fluorescence, and Fourier Transform Infra-red imaging of the altered paint layers to address one of the long-standing questions about cadmium yellow alteration—the roles of cadmium carbonates and <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphates</b> found in the altered paint layers. These compounds have often been assumed to be photo-oxidation products, but could also be residual starting reagents from an indirect wet process synthesis of CdS. The data presented here allow identifying and mapping the location of cadmium carbonates, cadmium chlorides, <b>cadmium</b> oxalates, <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphates,</b> and <b>cadmium</b> sulphides in thin sections of altered cadmium yellow paints from The Joy of Life and Matisse’s Flower Piece (1906, The Barnes Foundation). Distribution of various cadmium compounds confirms that <b>cadmium</b> carbonates and <b>sulphates</b> are photo-degradation products in The Joy of Life, whereas in Flower Piece, cadmium carbonates {{appear to have been}} a [(partially) unreacted] starting reagent for the yellow paint, a role previously suggested in other altered yellow paints...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} and measure any relations between occupational exposure to cadmium compounds (oxide, sulphide, and sulphate) {{and the risk}} of mortality from lung cancer. METHODS: The mortality experience of 571 male production workers from a cadmium recovery facility in the United States was investigated for the period 1940 - 82. All study subjects were first employed in the period 1926 - 69; they had all been employed for at least six months between 1 January 1940 and 31 December 1969. Newly abstracted detailed job histories for the period 1926 - 76 were combined with assessments of exposures to cadmium over time to develop individual estimates of cumulative exposure to cadmium (total exposure and exposures received both in the presence and absence of "high" exposures to arsenic trioxide). Poisson regression was used to investigate risks of mortality from lung cancer in relation to four concentrations of cumulative exposure to cadmium (2000 mg. m- 3. days). RESULTS: After adjustment for age attained, year of hire, and Hispanic ethnicity, there was a significant positive trend (P < 0. 05) between cumulative exposure to cadmium and risks of mortality from lung cancer. Relative to a risk of unity for the lowest exposure category (first level), risks were 2. 30 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 72 to 7. 36), 2. 83 (95 % CI 0. 75 to 10. 72), and 3. 88 (95 % CI 1. 04 to 14. 46) for the second, third, and fourth categories, respectively. Similar findings were obtained after adjustment for age only. Trends were more pronounced when employment histories were lagged first by 10 years and then by 20 years. A separate analysis examined the independent effects of exposure to cadmium received in the presence of high exposures to arsenic trioxide (mainly cadmium oxide) and exposures to cadmium received without such exposure to arsenic (mainly cadmium sulphide and <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphate).</b> A significant trend for a risk of lung cancer was found only for exposures to cadmium received in the presence of arsenic trioxide. CONCLUSIONS: Hypotheses which are consistent with the study findings include: (a) cadmium oxide in the presence of arsenic trioxide is a human lung carcinogen, (b) cadmium oxide and arsenic trioxide are human lung carcinogens and <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and cadmium sulphide are not (or they are less potent carcinogens), or (c) arsenic trioxide is a human lung carcinogen and cadmium oxide, <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> and cadmium sulphide are not.

Silikarunkoisen erotusmateriaalin happo-emäsominaisuuksia selvitettiin titrauksin. Metallien sitoutumisen kinetiikkaa ja eluointia verrattiin PS-DVB-runkoisen erotus-materiaalin kirjallisuudessa esitettyihin tuloksiin. Lisäksi määritettiin kummankin erotusmateriaalin partikkelikokojakaumat. Silikarunkoisen materiaalin havaittiin turpoavan noin 4 % muutettaessa se vapaastaemäsmuodosta happomuotoon. Turpoaminen oli huomattavasti vähäisempää kuin PS-DVB-runkoisella materiaalilla. Silikarunkoisen erotus-materiaalin titrauksen tuloksena voitiin todeta, että se oli heikosti emäksinen. Titrauskäyrä muistutti PS-DVB-runkoisen erotusmateriaalin titrauskäyrää, vaikka erotusmateriaalien protonoitumisalueet olivat hieman erilaiset. Tämä johtuu siitä, että silikarunkoisen materiaalin funktionaaliset ryhmät poikkeavat rakenteeltaan hieman PS-DVB-runkoisesta materiaalista. Tasapainokokeet osoittivat, että silikarunkoinen erotusmateriaali adsorboi tutkituista metalleista eniten kuparia ja nikkeliä ja vähiten sinkkiä. Kaikkien tutkittujen metallien eluointi silikarunkoisesta erotusmateriaalista onnistui rikkihapolla toisin kuin PS-DVB-runkoisesta erotusmateriaalista, jonka regenerointiin tarvitaan rikkihappoa tai ammoniumhydroksidia riippuen siitä, mitä metalleja siihen on ladattu.

The metal binding properties {{were compared to}} polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) -based reference material with column experiments. The functional groups of both materials are similar according to the manufacturers. The acid-base-properties of the silica based separation material were determined by titrations. The metal ion binding kinetics and the elution were studied and they were compared with the PS-DVB-based material. The particle size distributions of both separation materials were also determined. The silica-based separation material swelled about 4 %, when changed from free base form to acid form. This was {{much less than the}} swelling of the PS-DVB-based material. The titration results of the silica-based material showedthat it is weakly basic. The titration curve resembled the titration curve of the PS-DVB-based material, even though there were some differences between the protonation areas. This is because the structure of the functional groups of the silica-based material differ slighly from the PS-DVB-based material. The results of the equilibrium experiments showed that the silica-based material is most selective for copper and nickel and least selective for zinc among the investigatedmetals. Each of the metals could be eluted with sulphuric acid from the silica-based material. The PS-DVB-based material requires either sulphuric acid or ammonium hydroxide for the regeneration, depending on the metal in question. Columnruns showed that the silica-based separation material adsorbs better copper from concentrated zinc sulphate solutions than the PS-DVB-based material.

40|$|A feedback-controlled fed-batch process {{during the}} uptake of <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphate</b> for the {{subsequent}} production of cadmium sulphide quantum semiconductors using Schizosaccharomyces pombe was developed. The system {{is capable of}} maximising S. pombe biomass yield per fermentation and as a result, maximises cadmium sulphide quantum semiconductor production per fermentation. Using a S. pombe chemostat, biomass production was maximised with respect to minimising glucose repression and ethanol production when the specific growth rate was 0. 1 h− 1. Direct feedback control of the glucose feed in a fed-batch fermentation with RQ data at a set-point of RQ = 1 and the specific growth rate of 0. 1 h− 1 resulted in reduced glucose repression and ethanol production even after the cytotoxic heavy metal cadmium {{was added to the}} fermentation. A final biomass yield (dry cell weight) of 18. 2 g/liter for the induction of CdS quantum semiconductors was a 4 fold increase in the biomass available compared to previous batch fermentations carried out by the author...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Nanocrystalline CdS {{thin films}} were {{deposited}} on glass substrate by chemical bath deposition method using <b>Cadmium</b> <b>Sulphate</b> and Thiourea as Cd+ 2 and S- 2 ion sources for different molarities i. e. 0. 1 M, 0. 2 M and 0. 3 M. The crystallite size and lattice parameters for each sample were determined from X-Ray diffraction data using Scherrer’s formula. The {{value of the}} crystallite size {{was found to be}} within the range 14. 7 nm- 11. 4 nm. The optical characterization was done by UV-Visible and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The optical band gap of the films was determined from the transmittance spectra. It was observed that when the molarity increases, the average crystallite size decreases and the band gap energy of the prepared films increases. Photoluminescence studies showed a prominent peak at around 530 nm. The radius of the nanocrystalline films had been evaluated from the absorption spectrum by using effective mass approximation formula...|$|E
40|$|Cadmium {{selenide}} (CdSe) {{thin films}} {{have been successfully}} prepared by the electrodeposition technique on indium doped tin oxide (ITO) substrates with aqueous solutions of <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and selenium dioxide. The deposited films were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive analysis by X-rays (EDAX), photoluminescence (PL), UV spectrometry and electrical resistivity measurements. XRD analysis shows that the films are polycrystalline in nature with hexagonal crystalline structure. The various parameters such as crystallite size, micro strain, dislocation density and texture coefficients were evaluated. SEM study shows that the total substrate surface is well covered with uniformly distributed spherical shaped grains. Photoluminescence spectra of films were recorded to understand the emission properties of the films. The presence of direct transition with band gap energy 1. 75 eV is established from optical studies. The electrical resistivity of the thin films {{is found to be}} 10 (6) Omega cm and the results are discussed. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
