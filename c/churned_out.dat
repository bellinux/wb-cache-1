In response, the authorities instructed newspapers and websites to strictly report only official releases, and arrested six people accused of 'rumourmongering'.|$|E

Its Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company (ADDSCO) supported the war effort by producing ships faster than the Axis powers could sink them. ADDSCO also <b>churned</b> <b>out</b> a copious number of T2 tankers for the War Department. Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation, a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Corporation, focused on building freighters, s, and minesweepers. The rapid increase of population in the city produced crowded conditions, increasing social tensions in the competition for housing and good jobs.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention, the Virginia Federal Constitution {{was open}} to the public and crowds filled the {{galleries}} along with the press. Delegates changed sides over the debates, demonstrators paraded in the streets, and the press <b>churned</b> <b>out</b> accounts of the proceedings along with commentary pamphlets. The Federalist Papers first became a factor in state ratification conventions outside New York in Virginia. Although a majority of Virginians were said to be against adoption of the Constitution, and the Anti-federalists had the oratorical advantage with Patrick Henry, the Federalists were better organized under the leadership of judges who had been trained by George Wythe, and former Continental Army officers who aligned with George Washington.|$|E

However, Shelley's biographies have not been fully appreciated until recently.

Unlike previous games, Myst attempted to keep players immersed {{in the world by}} removing all information not associated with the fictional world itselfno explanatory text, inventory, or score counters. Myst has also been cited as the reason for the decline of the adventure game genre; eager to capitalize on Mysts success, publishers <b>churned</b> <b>out</b> mediocre Myst clones, which flooded the market. By Exiles release, games like Myst were considered to be an [...] "antiquated" [...] form of gaming by some critics.|$|E

The well would not have struck oil if it had been drilled just 50 feet (15 m) to the south.

500|$|In his 1975 work A Pictorial History of Science Fiction Films, Jeff Rovin {{stated that}} the film was [...] "confusing but colourful", and commended it for its [...] "superb special effects".

500|$|Brian Linder of IGN commented [...] "2004's Greatest Hits: My Prerogative [...] {{captured}} the highlights from Britney's heyday, but lacks the more mature club-oriented material that she's <b>churned</b> <b>out</b> in recent years. That helps make this collection a justifiable fan purchase". Mike Diver of BBC Online called it [...] "the definitive Britney album" [...] {{and added that}} [...] "these songs don't just make a mark, lingering in the memory– they are essential pieces of {{the past ten years}} of pop history, and deserve better than dismissal by so-called discerning listeners". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called the album [...] "a high-gloss collection of tunes that selectively sums up the career of one of the biggest female pop singers of the past decade. It's a disc that's light on filler [...] and heavy on Spears' more high-energy cuts, which, without question, play to her strengths as a performer". Sputnikmusic stated [...] "This is Britney's second greatest hits, and it's incredibly strong. It focuses mainly on her more upbeat, danceable numbers, with a few slower ones thrown in to change things up without disrupting the constant stream of quality pop songs" [...] and summarized the review adding [...] "As {{one of the most successful}} artists of the decade, is it any wonder this compilation is so good?".|$|E

Robert Copsey of Digital Spy commented that the [...] " [...] is a classic Beyoncé track waiting to happen". Chad Grischow of IGN wrote that [...] "the lush backing music and [...] soaring vocals" [...] on the song sound suitable for an updated take on the [...] soundtrack album as Beyoncé is ecstatic that she ended a poor relationship {{before it was too}} late. Jon Caramainca of The New York Times commented that the [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] has [...] "optimistic, coffee-commercial" [...] pianos, which place Beyoncé directly in Lilith Fair territory. James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that {{it is one of the}} best ballads on the album 4. James Dinh of the same publication added that the song has a radio-friendly appeal and a catchy chorus. Similarly, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly and Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle praised the song's radio nature, with the latter calling it [...] "a return to form" [...] with a [...] "regal sound of a radio smash". Jim Farber of Daily News wrote that the melodies and the clever lyrics of [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] are likely to inspire significant airplay.

Aamir Khan holds back where he could easily resort to an extravagant display of drama and emotions." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN argued that the true power of the film lies in its [...] "remarkable, rooted, rock-solid script which provides the landscape for such an emotionally engaging, heart-warming experience." [...] Manish Gajjar from the BBC stated that the film [...] "touches your heart and moves you deeply with its sterling performances. [...] a film full of substance!" [...] Jaspreet Pandohar, also of BBC, posited that Taare Zameen Par is a [...] "far cry from the formulaic masala flicks <b>churned</b> <b>out</b> by the Bollywood machine," [...] and is [...] "an inspirational story that is as emotive as it is entertaining; {{this is a little}} twinkling star of a movie." [...] Furthermore, Aprajita Anil of Screen gave the film four stars and stated, [...] "Taare Zameen Par cannot be missed. Because it is different. Because it is delightful. Because it would make everyone think. Because it would help everyone grow. Because very rarely do performances get so gripping. And of course because the 'perfectionist' actor has shaped into a 'perfectionist' director." [...] In addition, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap stated that, [...] "Taare Zameen Par took me back to my hostel days. If you take away the dyslexia, it seems like my story. The film affected me so deeply that I was almost left speechless. After watching the film, I was asked how I liked Taare Zameen Par. I could not talk as I was deeply overwhelmed." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} nine hundred people {{attended}} the event.
