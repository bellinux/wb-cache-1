50|$|<b>Cloprostenol</b> is a {{synthetic}} analogue of prostoglandin F2α (PGF2α). It {{is a potent}} luteolytic agent; this means that, within hours of administration, it causes the corpus luteum to stop production of progesterone, and to reduce in size over several days. This effect is used in animals to induce estrus and to cause abortion.|$|E
50|$|The FP {{receptor}} is {{the least}} selective of the prostenoid receptors {{in that it is}} responsive to PGD2 {{and to a lesser extent}} PGE2 at concentrations close to those of PGF2α. Standard prostanoids have the following relative efficacies as receptor ligands in binding to and activating FP: PGF2α>PGD2>PGE2>PGI2=TXA2. In typical binding studies, PGF2α has one-half maximal binding and cell stimulating actions at ~1 nanomolar whereas PGD2 and PGE2 are ~5- to 10-fold and 10-100-fold weaker than this. The synthetic analogs that like PGF2α act as selective receptor agonists of FP viz., <b>cloprostenol,</b> flupostenol, latanoprost, and tafluprost (acid form) have FP binding affinities and stimulating potencies similar to PGF2α while others as enprostil, sulprostone, U46619, carbacyclin, and iloprost are considerably weaker FP agonists. Fluprostenol is a widely used clinically as a selective FP receptor agonist; latanoprost is a suitable substitute.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} a second injection of either <b>cloprostenol</b> or oxytocin after initial <b>cloprostenol</b> induction on the farrowing response of sows. Methods: Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, sows received one of two treatments: either a single IM injection of 175 µg <b>cloprostenol</b> at day 113 of gestation (n= 49) or an IM injection of 175 µg <b>cloprostenol</b> at day 113 of gestation followed by second IM injection of 175 µg <b>cloprostenol</b> 6 hours later (n= 54). In experiment 2, sows received either a single (n= 59) or a double (n= 48) <b>cloprostenol</b> injection, as above, or a third treatment in which an IM injection of 30 IU oxytocin (n= 56) replaced the second <b>cloprostenol</b> injection. Results: After a single <b>cloprostenol</b> injection, 61 % of sows farrowed during the following working day. When a second <b>cloprostenol</b> or oxytocin injection was administered 6 hours later, 86 % of sows farrowed during the next working day. Implications: A regime of <b>cloprostenol</b> administered twice or <b>cloprostenol</b> plus oxytocin markedly improved the predictability of induced parturition.

Heifers were assigned at random within <b>cloprostenol</b> and dexamethasone groups to receive relaxin (1 mg, n= 5 /treatment), i. m. or in the cervical os (OS), at 0 h (the same time as <b>cloprostenol</b> and dexamethasone) or 24 h later. Eleven and six first-calving heifers and sixteen and nine second-calving cows also received <b>cloprostenol</b> + relaxin and <b>cloprostenol</b> + phos-phate-buffered saline, respectively. Radioimmunoassay of daily plasma samples indicated an abrupt decrease in progesterone with time (p< 0. 001), from 7. 5 ± 0. 50 to 1. 0 ± 0. 30 ng/ml (mean ± SE) within 48 hfor all groups. The mean rate of progesterone decrease (ng/ml in 24 h) was accelerated (p< 0. 01) in relaxin-treated heifers (5. 3 ± 0. 36), in contrast to dexamethasone- and cloprostenol-treated control heifers (2. 8 ± 0. 40). Relaxin combined with <b>cloprostenol</b> or dexamethasone shortened the calving period in these heifers by reducing the interval between treatment and calving (33 vs. 56 h; p< 0. 01).

40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} {{describes}} the clinical features and plasma profiles of bovine pregnancy-associated glycoprotein 1 (bPAG 1), the main metabolite of prostaglandin F 2 α (PG metabolite) and progesterone (P 4) in heifers in which early abortions were induced. Methods Early abortions were induced in four heifers with <b>cloprostenol</b> and monitored by ultrasonography. Blood {{samples were collected}} and the plasma were analyzed for bPAG 1, P 4 and PG metabolite. Results The foetal heartbeat rates varied from 170 – 186 beats per minute for all foetuses up to the date of <b>cloprostenol</b> treatment. Foetal death was confirmed within two days after <b>cloprostenol</b> treatment. Prior to <b>cloprostenol</b> injection, blood plasma concentrations of bPAG 1, PG metabolite and P 4 varied from 8. 4 – 40. 0 ng/mL, 158 – 275 pmol/L and 20. 7 – 46. 9 nmol/L, respectively. After the foetus expelled, the plasma level of bPAG 1 began to decrease but the decrease was small and gradual. The estimated half-life of bPAG 1 was 1. 8 – 6. 6 days. The plasma level of the PG metabolite started to have short lasting peaks (above 300 pmol/L) within three hours after <b>cloprostenol</b> treatment. The plasma concentrations of P 4 dropped sharply to less than 4 nmol/L after 24 hours of <b>cloprostenol</b> injection. Conclusion The current findings indicated that after early closprostenol-induced foetal death, the plasma concentration of bPAG 1 decreased gradually and showed a tendency of variation with the stages of pregnancy. </p...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{reproductive}} efficiency in dairy cows with retained placenta (RP), treated with Florfenicol associated or not with <b>Cloprostenol.</b> One hundred and eight cows with RP from dairy herds in southern Minas Gerais state and northern São Paulo state, were included for this purpose. The experiment was designed in factorial 2 X 2. The four treatments encompassed two levels of each factor : 1) Florfenicol - 4 0 mg/kg (IM) divided in two injections or 40 mg / kg (SC) in one injection after calving; 2) <b>Cloprostenol</b> (0. 530 mg) - two injections associated with florfenicol treatment or without <b>cloprostenol.</b> The analysis of discrete variables used the Kruskal - Wallis (fou r groups) or Wilcoxon (two groups) statistic to compare groups.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of <b>cloprostenol</b> in inducing estrus in cycling Rusa timorensis hinds by assessing circulating progesterone (P 4) concentration, occurence of estrus and pregnancy rate. Estrus was synchronized in eight cycling hinds with 500 ?g <b>cloprostenol</b> given intramuscularly at 10 days apart. Eight other R. timorensis hinds were not-synchronized and served as control. Blood samples, collected every three to four days for 29 days from 24 hours prior to the first <b>cloprostenol</b> injection, were analyzed for plasma progesterone concentration. Estrus was recorded based on observation of estrus signs during the period of blood sampling and all hinds were subjected to transrectal ultrasonography to assess pregnancy status.

40|$|Intramuscular {{injection}} of the naturally occurring prostaglandin F- 2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) to sexually mature female pigs induces luteolysis and rapidly elicits a behavioural response consistent with pre-partum nest-building. Intramuscular {{injection of}} the synthetic prostaglandin F- 2 alpha (<b>cloprostenol)</b> also induces luteolysis but no nest-building behaviour is observed. The effects of PGF(2 alpha), but not <b>cloprostenol,</b> on nest-building behaviour may be mediated via peripheral PGF(2 alpha) receptors (FP) or via direct action on central FP receptors. We have previously shown FP receptor mRNA to be localized in porcine paraventricular nucleus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus (SON) and pars dorso-medialis of the suproptic nucleus (SOD), suprachiasmatic nucleus, choroid plexus and anterior and intermediate pituitary lobes. In this experiment, we examined hypothalamic {{expression of the}} immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun mRNA after treatment with PGF(2 alpha) or <b>cloprostenol.</b> Twenty-one 8 -month-old nulliparous female pigs (gilts) were injected intramuscularly with a luteolytic dose of PGF(2 alpha) (15 mg), <b>cloprostenol</b> (175 mug) or saline control, their behaviour was recorded and they were killed 60 min later. Coronal hypothalamic sections and control ovarian tissues were incubated with 45 -mer oligonucleotide probes complementary to porcine c-fos and c-jun genes using standard in situ hybridization histochemistry techniques. Significantly higher c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression was found in PGF(2 alpha) -treated compared to saline or cloprostenol-treated pigs in the PVN, SON and SOD. Significantly higher c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression was found in corpus lutea of PGF(2 alpha) and cloprostenol-treated pigs compared to saline controls. Treatment with PGF(2 alpha) induced nest-building behaviour whereas treatment with <b>cloprostenol</b> and saline did not. This suggests that PGF(2 alpha), or one of its metabolites, and not <b>cloprostenol,</b> crosses the blood-brain barrier and acts directly on hypothalamic receptors to mediate its effect on nest-building behaviour...|$|E

One hundred and three buffaloes under peri-urban management and 40 buffaloes under rural management belonging to six and 21 farmers, respectively, were included in this study. Buffaloes that did not show heat signs for 6 - 12 months postpartum were considered anoestrus in this study. For inducing heat, two injections of <b>cloprostenol</b> were administered in silent oestrous buffaloes, whereas gonadotropin releasing hormone followed by <b>cloprostenol</b> was administered in true anoestrous buffaloes. A higher proportion of buffaloes (35 %) was noted in anoestrus under rural than under peri-urban management (17. 5 %, P= 0. 02). All the buffaloes diagnosed as silent oestrus responded to <b>cloprostenol</b> therapy by showing heat signs under both management systems. However 71 % rural buffaloes diagnosed in true anoestrus showed heat symptoms compared to 100 % peri-urban buffaloes followed by GnRH+cloprostenol therapy. Fixed time insemination (72 and 96 hours after 2 nd <b>cloprostenol</b> injection) resulted in a conception rate of 58 % and 67 % in rural and peri-urban buffaloes, respectively.

The ewes had jugular venous blood samples collected at 4 -hourly intervals from 42 h before the induction of luteolysis by i. m. injection of <b>cloprostenol</b> (100 =m) on day 10 of the oestrous cycle, until day 3 of the following cycle. There were five periods of intensive blood sampling, when both ovarian and jugular venous blood samples were col-lected, as follows: (a) mid-luteal phase, before the second injection of <b>cloprostenol</b> on day 10 (15 -min intervals for 6 h); (b) early follicular phase, 24 h afte...|$|E
40|$|PRL and placental lactogen (PL) {{play key}} roles in {{maintaining}} the rodent corpus luteum through pregnancy. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) {{have been shown to}} decrease cell sensitivity to cytokines, including PRL, and so here we have addressed the issue of whether luteolysis induced by prostaglandin F- 2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) might up-regulate SOCS proteins to inhibit PRL signaling. In d 19 pregnant rats, <b>cloprostenol,</b> a PGF(2 alpha) analog, rapidly induced transcripts for SOCS- 3 and, to a lesser extent, SOCS- 1. We also found increased SOCS- 3 protein in the ovary by immunoblot and in the corpus luteum by immunohistochemistry. Increased SOCS- 3 expression was preceded by an increase in STAT 3 tyrosine phosphorylation 10 min after <b>cloprostenol</b> injection and was maintained for 4 h, as determined by gel shift and immunohistochemistry. Induction of SOCS- 3 was accompanied by a sharp decrease in active STAT 5, as determined by gel-shift assay and by loss of nuclear localized STAT 5. Four hours after <b>cloprostenol</b> administration, the corpus luteum was refractory to stimulation of STAT 5 by PRL administration, and this was not due to down-regulation of PRL receptor. Therefore, induction of SOCS- 3 by PGF(2 alpha) may be an important element in the initiation of luteolysis via rapid suppression of luteotropic support from PL...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Uterine {{histological}} {{analysis by}} serial biopsies {{are an important}} tool not only for a better understanding and evaluation of physiological events {{involved in the process}} of uterine involution, but also for the identification and monitoring of pathological process that may compromise reproductive life. This study describes a temporal histological changes in endometrial tissues from multiparous Nelore cows in Southeast Brazil treated or not treated with <b>Cloprostenol</b> sodium 1 and 4 days postpartum (DPP), to determine if the treatment promotes histological endometrial involution. <b>Cloprostenol</b> sodium was administered on 1 and 4 DPP and endometrial biopsies were collected 1, 7, 14, 28, and 42 DPP using a Yomann´s biopsy instrument. The presence or absence of myometrial and endometrial tissue and its integrity, number of endometrial glands (classification 0 to 3), edema, hemorrhage, vascular congestion and type of epithelial cell was assessed. The average number of leukocytes was recorded. There was observed difference between groups on the number of endometrial glands (P≤ 0. 05) at one-time point.   In addition, the degree of inflammation was reduced (P≤ 0. 05) on time points. <b>Cloprostenol</b> sodium did not alter the histological appearance of uterine tissue during the postpartum period or reduce the period of uterine involution. Additionally, serial biopsies did not affect the fertility of the animals...|$|E
40|$|Ovarian cycle {{synchrony}} {{was assessed}} in spontaneously cy-cling female {{golden lion tamarins}} by monitoring longitudinal (16 mo) urinary steroid metabolite (estrone conjugates; pregnane-diol- 3 oa-glucuronide, PdG) excretion in four pairs (n = 8) of females isolated from males. The overall mean ovarian cycle du-ration was 18. 5 0. 3 days (n = 136 cycles; mean range, 15. 7 - 21. 0 days), {{and there was no}} evidence of reproductive season-ality. Laparoscopic ovarian examinations confirmed that cyclic fluctuations in urinary steroid metabolite excretion were tem-porally associated with the formation and demise of corpora lutea. Evaluation of ovarian synchronization tested the null hy-pothesis that urinary hormone cycles were expressed randomly relative to those of cagemates or other females housed in sep-arate cages but within close proximity. Natural ovarian synchro-ny (expressed as the mean difference in ovarian cycle onset) between cagemates (4. 1 0. 4 days) and among noncagemates (4. 2 ± 0. 2 days) did not differ (p> 0. 05) from a random ovarian cycle distribution. Two trials also were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the prostaglandin (PG) F 2,, analogue, cloprosten-ol, for artificially synchronizing ovarian cycles. Induced ovarian synchrony was not achieved with a single 0. 8 -jg i. m. injection of <b>cloprostenol.</b> However, doubling the <b>cloprostenol</b> dose (1. 6 jig) caused a rapid decrease in mean urinary PdG (p < 0. 05) within 2 days, and synchronous ovulation was demonstrated by an increase (p < 0. 01) in mean urinary PdG 10 days after clo-prostenol administration. In summary, females housed in pairs, in the absence of males, exhibit spontaneous, year-round ovar-ian cycles with no evidence of among-female ovarian synchrony. Results also suggest that this New World primate has a reduced sensitivity to <b>cloprostenol</b> (compared to common marmosets) but that a single, midcycle <b>cloprostenol</b> injection of 1. 6 jlg ef-fectively induces luteolysis and synchronous ovulation...|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} investigating {{the effects of}} prostaglandins and prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors on libido in boars. In Experiment 1, two prostaglandin products were compared with regard to expediting the training of boars for semen collection. On each of five consecutive days, boars received i. m. treatment with saline, dinoprost tromethamine or <b>cloprostenol</b> sodium (n= 12 /group). On each of day 1 (p= 0. 06), day 2 (p 0. 1), the percentage of boars collected after dinoprost tromethamine, but not <b>cloprostenol</b> sodium, was greater than controls. In Experiments 2 and 3, libido in boars that were trained previously for semen collection was assessed after treatment with prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, testing the hypothesis that endogenous release of prostaglandin is necessary for expression of sexual behaviors.

40|$|Summary. Follicles {{of various}} sizes at {{the surface of the}} ovary were ablated by {{electrocautery}} at the time of cloprostenol-induced luteolysis in ewes and the interval from <b>cloprostenol</b> treatment to the onset of the LH surge determined as an index of the time from luteolysis to ovulation. When follicles 2 =n-mm or> 4 mm diameter remained in the ovaries, the interval from <b>cloprostenol</b> treatment to the onset of the LH surge was similar to that in sham-operated (control) ewes (55 =n- 0 h), whereas when the only follicles remaining were < 2 mm, the interval was extended by 24 h (P < 0 =. 5). This study demonstrates that follicles capable of ovulating can be selected from those =ge mm diameter at luteolysis, emphasizing the flexibility of the sheep ovary in its final selection of the ovulatory follicle...|$|E
