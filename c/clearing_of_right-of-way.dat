50|$|In 1874 Barnard won the {{government}} contract {{to build the}} Edmonton to Cache Creek section of the new transcontinental telegraph line (all telegraph communications between BC and the outside world had until then gone through the United States). This proved to be disastrous, as {{the government}}'s plans were ill-conceived, changing the route twice, and Barnard was forced {{to sit on a}} large investment in steamboats, packtrains, supplies, wire and other supplies until 1874, when a new government (that of A.C. Elliott) cancelled the contract altogether, as its predecessor had commissioned the <b>clearing</b> <b>of</b> a <b>right-of-way</b> for telegraph and railway before even confirming the route. Barnard pursued a large claim for compensation, but the strain to his health from the losses incurred in this venture and the previous road-steamers misadventure contributed to a failing constitution. Barnard had his first paralyzing stroke in 1880, which left him invalid until his death on July 10, 1889.|$|R
40|$|Installation {{of traffic}} signal control system at {{relatively}} high traffic volume intersections {{is expected to}} safeguard drivers at such intersections by providing a <b>clear</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>right–of–way</b> to drivers. However, a particular operational issue is the existence of dilemma zone conflicts if the type traffic signal system installed is not properly selected and designed. The problem is critical for isolated intersections on relatively high speed road sections. This paper describes result of a study carried out to investigate the existence of dilemma zone conflicts at isolated intersections installed with various types of traffic signal control systems. Three indicators of dilemma zone conflicts considered in the analysis are (i) stop abruptly; (ii) accelerate through amber period; and (iii) red–light running. Data pertaining {{to the analysis of}} dilemma zone conflicts was collected at eight isolated intersections with different types of traffic signal control systems using a video–recording technique. The data includes vehicles’ approaching speed, distance from the stop line at the onset of amber, the decision made by the drivers at onset of amber as well as the types of vehicles driven. The result shows that relatively large proportion of drivers did not willing to stop at onset of amber signal. A vehicle–actuated traffic signal system appears to perform better compared to other types of system in terms of reduction in dilemma zone conflicts at isolated signalized intersections...|$|R

Additionally, as there is no grade separation involved, costs are considerably less than that of an interchange alternative.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{recognition}} that the narrow linear strips of uncultivated vegetation that lie between roads and agricultural crops, referred to as roadside right-of-ways or verges, can serve as areas {{for the conservation of}} wildlife. The features <b>of</b> <b>right-of-ways</b> that should influence the composition of wildlife communities vary considerably. Our goal was to determine what features <b>of</b> <b>right-of-ways</b> increased the conservation potential <b>of</b> <b>right-of-ways</b> for wildlife in a grassland system dominated by agricultural production. We sampled 100 right-of-ways for birds and 92 right-of-ways for small mammals in McDonough and Warren Counties in west-central Illinois. We found that the sizes <b>of</b> <b>right-of-ways</b> and the amount of traffic on the adjacent roads synergistically worked to influence wildlife communities. On roads with low traffic, avian species richness increased rapidly with increased right-of-way width, while on roads with high traffic, avian richness increased only slightly with increasing right-of-way widths. We found that wider roadside right-of-ways (preferably across the road from equally wide right-of-ways) with thicker and taller vegetation had the greatest conservation value for birds and small mammals. The features that enhanced the conservation value <b>of</b> <b>right-of-ways</b> in our study area were uncommon. Efforts to create or enhance these features for the benefit of wildlife would likely face numerous obstacles. Nonetheless, from a grassland conservation perspective, working with stakeholders to implement specific strategies to enhance these often neglected areas may be an effective complement to purchasing and restoring conservation lands away from roads...|$|R
