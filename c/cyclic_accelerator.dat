40|$|This {{monograph}} {{begins with}} {{a review of the}} basic equations of spin motion in particle accelerators. It then reviews how polarized protons can be accelerated to several tens of GeV using as examples the preaccelerators of HERA, a 6. 3 km long <b>cyclic</b> <b>accelerator</b> at DESY / Hamburg. Such techniques have already been used at the AGS of BNL / New York, to accelerate polarized protons to 25 GeV. But for acceleration to energies of several hundred GeV as in RHIC, TEVATRON, HERA, LHC, or a VLHC, new problems can occur which can lead to a significantly diminished beam polarization. For these high energies, it is necessary to look in more detail at the spin motion, and for that the invariant spin field {{has proved to be a}} useful tool. This is already widely used for the description of high-energy electron beams that become polarized by the emission of spin-flip synchrotron radiation. It is shown that this field gives rise to an adiabatic invariant of spin-orbit motion and that it defines the maximum time average polarization available to a particle physics experiment. These concepts make it possible to optimize a high-energy accelerator for storing highly polarized beams. The utility of the invariant spin field is illustrated by simulations of spin motion in HERA and in other high-energy accelerators. Various methods for computing the invariant spin field, the adiabatic spin invariant, and the amplitude dependent spin tune are presented. Moreover, several high-energy spin-orbit dynamical effects will be discussed which go beyond conventional models of spin dynamics and were observed in simulations with these novel methods.
