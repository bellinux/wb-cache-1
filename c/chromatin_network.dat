That is, chromosome interactions and lncRNAs together form {{a network of}} three-dimensional transcriptional regulation. Although both components are important and {{should be considered as}} a whole in transcriptional regulation in this three-dimensional view, lncRNAs play significant roles in organizing and/or maintaining the three-dimensional <b>chromatin</b> <b>network</b> formed by different chromosome interactions. Thus scientists are paying more attention to lncRNAs mediated regulation, and this is also the focus of our own lab.|$|E

40|$|Mitotic {{chromosomes}} {{are essential}} structures for the faithful transmission of duplicated genomic DNA into two daughter cells during cell division. Although more than 100 {{years have passed}} since chromosomes were first observed, it remains unclear how a long string of genomic DNA is packaged into compact mitotic chromosomes. Although the classical view is that human chromosomes consist of radial 30 nm chromatin loops that are somehow tethered centrally by scaffold proteins, called condensins, cryo-electron microscopy observation of frozen hydrated native chromosomes reveals a homogeneous, grainy texture and neither higher-order nor periodic structures including 30 nm chromatin fibres were observed. As a compromise to fill this huge gap, we propose a model in which the radial chromatin loop structures in the classic view are folded irregularly toward the chromosome centre with the increase in intracellular cations during mitosis. Consequently, compact native chromosomes are made up primarily of irregular <b>chromatin</b> <b>networks</b> cross-linked by self-assembled condensins forming the chromosome scaffol...|$|R
40|$|Movement of {{particles}} in cell nuclei {{can be affected}} by viscosity, directed flows, active transport, or the presence of obstacles such as the <b>chromatin</b> <b>network.</b> Here we investigate whether the mobility of small fluorescent proteins {{is affected by the}} chromatin density. Diffusion of inert fluorescent proteins was studied in living cell nuclei using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with a two-color confocal scanning detection system. We first present experiments exposing FCS-specific artifacts encountered in live cell studies as well as strategies to prevent them, in particular those arising from the choice of the fluorophore used for calibration of the focal volume, as well as temperature and acquisition conditions used for fluorescence fluctuation measurements. After defining the best acquisition conditions, we show for various human cell lines that the mobility of GFP varies significantly within the cell nucleus, but does not correlate with chromatin density. The intranuclear diffusional mobility strongly depends on protein size: in a series of GFP-oligomers, used as free inert fluorescent tracers, the diffusion coefficient decreased from the monomer to the tetramer much more than expected for molecules free in aqueous solution. Still, the entire intranuclear <b>chromatin</b> <b>network</b> is freely accessible for small proteins up to the size of eGFP-tetramers, regardless of the chromatin density or cell line. Even the densest chromatin regions do not exclude free eGFP-monomers or multimers...|$|E
40|$|During interphase, {{chromosomes}} {{are relatively}} de-condensed {{in the nuclear}} space. Interphase chromosomes are known to occupy nuclear space in a non-random manner (chromosome territory); however, their internal structures are poorly defined. In particular, little is understood about the molecular mechanisms that govern the internal organization of interphase chromosomes. The author recently proposed that pairing (or interaction) of repetitive DNA-containing chromatin regions is a critical driving force that specifies the higher-order organization of eukaryotic chromosomes. Guided by this theoretical framework and published experimental data {{on the structure of}} interphase chromosomes and the spatial distribution of repetitive DNA in interphase nuclei, I postulate here a molecular structure of chromatin organization in interphase chromosomes. According to this model, an interphase chromosome is a chromatin mesh (or lattice) that is formed by repeat pairing (RP). The mesh consists of two types of structural components: chromosome nodes and loose chromatin fibers. Chromosome nodes are DNA repeat assemblies (RAs) that are formed via RP, while loose fibers include chromatin loops that radiate from the nodes. Different loops crosslink by RPs and form a large integrated <b>chromatin</b> <b>network.</b> I suggest that the organization of the <b>chromatin</b> <b>network</b> of a given interphase chromosome is intrinsically specified by the distribution of repetitive DNA elements on the linear chromatin. The stability of the organization is governed by the collection of RA-formed nodes, and the dynamics of the organization is driven by the assembling and disassembling of the nodes...|$|E

40|$|The three {{dimensional}} conformation of {{the genome}} in the cell nucleus influences important biological processes such as gene expression regulation. Recent studies have shown {{a strong correlation between}} chromatin interactions and gene co-expression. However, predicting gene co-expression from frequent long-range chromatin interactions remains challenging. We address this by characterizing the topology of the cortical <b>chromatin</b> interaction <b>network</b> using scale-aware topological measures. We demonstrate that based on these characterizations it is possible to accurately predict spatial co-expression between genes in the mouse cortex. Consistent with previous findings, we find that the chromatin interaction profile of a gene-pair is a good predictor of their spatial co-expression. However, the accuracy of the prediction can be substantially improved when chromatin interactions are described using scale-aware topological measures of the multi-resolution <b>chromatin</b> interaction <b>network.</b> We conclude that, for co-expression prediction, it is necessary to take into account different levels of chromatin interactions ranging from direct interaction between genes (i. e. small-scale) to chromatin compartment interactions (i. e. large-scale) ...|$|R
30|$|Although such {{networks}} are sometimes called interaction networks [12], {{it should be}} noted that a contact only reflects a spatial proximity at the time of the experiment. It may result from random thermal motion of DNA, and does not necessarily imply a specific biochemical or physical interaction between the genomic sites. Only a special experimental protocol (chromatin interaction analysis using paired end tags, ChIA-PET, [13]), designed to extract the contacts mediated by a given protein, e.g. a polymerase, gives access to <b>chromatin</b> interaction <b>networks</b> [14].|$|R
40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} is {{the ability}} of a genotype to produce contrasting phenotypes in different environments. Although many examples have been described, the responsible mechanisms are poorly understood. In particular, {{it is not clear how}} phenotypic plasticity is related to buffering, the maintenance of a constant phenotype against genetic or environmental variation. We investigate here the genetic basis of a particularly well described plastic phenotype: the abdominal pigmentation in female Drosophila melanogaster. Cold temperature induces a dark pigmentation, in particular in posterior segments, while higher temperature has the opposite effect. We show that the homeotic gene Abdominal-B (Abd-B) has a major role in the plasticity of pigmentation in the abdomen. Abd-B plays opposite roles on melanin production through the regulation of several pigmentation enzymes. This makes the control of pigmentation very unstable in the posterior abdomen, and we show that the relative spatio-temporal expression of limiting pigmentation enzymes in this region of the body is thermosensitive. Temperature acts on melanin production by modulating a <b>chromatin</b> regulator <b>network,</b> interacting genetically with the transcription factor bric-à-brac (bab), a target of Abd-B and Hsp 83, encoding the chaperone Hsp 90. Genetic disruption of this <b>chromatin</b> regulator <b>network</b> increases the effect of temperature and the instability of the pigmentation pattern in the posterior abdomen. Colocalizations on polytene chromosomes suggest that BAB and these chromatin regulators cooperate in the regulation of many targets, including several pigmentation enzymes. We show that they are also involved in sex com...|$|R

Digesting or stopping the production of RNAs, but not proteins, resulted in disorganized chromatin regions inside the nucleus. Increased evidences now indicate that lncRNAs play irreplaceable roles {{in the establishment of}} three-dimensional <b>chromatin</b> <b>network</b> (Quinodoz and Guttman, 2014; Rinn and Guttman, 2014). In several dynamic systems, the transcription of lncRNAs from enhancer regions (eRNAs) has been shown to correlate with the transcription of neighboring protein-coding genes (De Santa et al., 2010; Orom et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011 c). Studies with 3 C-related techniques subsequently provided evidences for a causal role in the establishment or maintenance of enhancer-promoter looping and activation of gene transcription.|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of {{a living}} cell requires a permanent transport of various macromolecules. In the cell nucleus, this transport is accomplished by diffusion and {{takes place in a}} dense network of chromatin fibers. This work deals with connections between the structure of chromatin fibers, their dynamics and the diffusional transport of macromolecules in the cell nucleus. The chromatin fibers are represented on a Cartesian lattice, based on the model of a semi-flexible chain polymer. Using a Monte Carlo procedure, specific lattice chain conformations that correspond to chromatin fibers in interphase are generated. Thereafter, random walks simulate the macromolecular diffusion in the thus created <b>chromatin</b> <b>network</b> The influences of chromatin structure on the mobility of diffusing macromolecules are investigated, particularly those arising from the folding into spatially separated subvolumes of the cell nucleus. This folding principle is known as compartmentalization and can be induced by the formation of specific chromatin loops. The simulations show that the fiber structure governs the spatial distribution of chromatin on different length scales in the cell nucleus. A measure of inhomogeneity is introduced to connect the spatial distribution of chromatin to the diffusion coefficient, the anomaly parameter and the characteristic length scale of anomalous diffusion. The determinability of this measure of inhomogeneity with confocal microscopy and DNA sequence analyses is examined, and different models of diffusion in polymer systems are compared to the simulations. Further, the effects of chromatin dynamics and a high concentration of diffusing macromolecules on the diffusion behavior are analyzed. Chromatin dynamics enhances the accessibility of the <b>chromatin</b> <b>network,</b> particularly {{in the case of a}} high concentration of mutually obstructing diffusing macromolecules. The obstruction of individual diffusing macromolecules by chromatin fibers can be distinguished from the obstruction caused by other diffusing macromolecules in terms of diffusion coefficients and the characteristic length scales of anomalous diffusion. The dynamics of chromatin is only slightly decelerated by a high concentration of diffusing macromolecules. A high density of chromatin and the entanglement of chromatin fibers cause much greater deceleration...|$|E
40|$|The {{eukaryotic}} cell nucleus harbors the DNA genome that is organized in a dynamic <b>chromatin</b> <b>network</b> and {{embedded in a}} viscous crowded fluid. This environment directly affects enzymatic reactions and target search processes that access the DNA sequence information. However, its physical properties as a reaction medium are poorly understood. Here, we exploit mobility measurements of differently sized inert green fluorescent tracer proteins to characterize the viscoelastic properties of the nuclear interior of a living human cell. We find that it resembles a viscous fluid on small and large scales, but appears viscoelastic on intermediate scales that change with protein size. Our {{results are consistent with}} simulations of diffusion through polymers and suggest that chromatin forms a random obstacle network rather than a self-similar structure with fixed fractal dimension. By calculating how long molecules remember their previous position in dependence on their size, we evaluate how the nuclear environment affects search processes of chromatin targets.

40|$|Mammalian {{chromosomes}} extensively {{communicate with}} each other via long-range chromatin interactions. These interactions are mostly mediated by proteins, which work as teams to control genes in the cells. These interactions could also help to unravel the mechanisms of diseases such as cancer, from new perspectives. The packaging of the chromatin fiber and how it relates to epigenetic marks that regulate its accessibility to govern lineage-specific gene expression repertoires is currently the focus of immense efforts worldwide. Moreover, how chromosomes are hierarchically folded and how they relate to each other as well as to structural hallmarks of the nucleus is a largely unchartered territory in large cell populations not to mention in individual cells. This thesis has an emphasis on the analysis of pivotal chromatin features of single cells. Thus, interactions between a genome organizer termed CTCF and a factor involved in DNA repair, PARP 1, could be demonstrated using the ISPLA technique. Such interactions likely underlie the formation of <b>chromatin</b> <b>networks.</b> Next, novel strategies/techniques were developed to visualize chromosomal structures and 3 D networks by scoring for chromatin proximities within individual cells. One strategy included a novel method termed Chromatin In Situ Proximity (ChrISP) to visualize and identify proximities between chromatin fibers and other structural hallmarks in single cells at a resolution < 170 Å beyond that of the light microscope. Thus, large-scale changes in conformations of a single human chromosome upon the administration of reprogramming cues could be visualized. Finally, this innovation was further developed to explore differences in proximities of chromatin fibers that organize chromosome territories. The novel design, termed “rainbow ChrISP” translates physical distances in 3 D, between chromatin fibres into different colors visualized with conventional microscope. This technique produced new insights into chromosome conformations and their regulation to enhance our understanding of their governing principles in single cells during development and disease...|$|R
40|$|Protein-protein {{interaction}} mapping {{has progressed}} rapidly in recent years, enabling {{the completion of}} several high throughput studies. However, knowledge of physical interactions is limited for numerous classes of proteins, such as chromatin bound proteins, due to their poor solubility when bound to DNA. To address this problem, we have developed a novel method, termed modified Chromatin Immunopurification (mChIP), which allows for the efficient purification of protein-DNA macromolecules, enabling subsequent protein identification by mass spectrometry. mChIP consists of a single affinity purification step, whereby <b>chromatin</b> bound protein <b>networks</b> are isolated from mildly sonicated and gently clarified cellular extracts using magnetic beads coated with antibodies. We applied the mChIP method in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing endogenously TAP tagged histone H 2 A or the histone variant Htz 1 p and successfully co-purified numerous <b>chromatin</b> bound protein <b>networks</b> as well as DNA. We further challenged the mChIP procedure by purifying three chromatin-bound bait proteins that have proven difficult to purify by traditional methods: Lge 1 p, Mcm 5 p and Yta 7 p.

Using high resolution immunoelectron microscopy (I-EM), we provide evidence that CNoBs (CRM 1 -Nucleolar bodies) and INBs (Intranucleolar bodies) are distinct genuine nucleolar structures in untreated HeLa cells. INBs are fibrillar and concentrate the post-translational modifiers SUMO 1 and SUMO- 2 / 3 as strongly as PML bodies. In contrast, the smallest CRM 1 -labeled CNoBs are vitreous, preferentially located at {{the periphery of the}} nucleolus and, intricately linked to the <b>chromatin</b> <b>network.</b> Upon blockage of the CRM 1 -dependent nuclear export by leptomycin B (LMB), CNoBs disappear while p 62 /SQSTM 1 -containing fibrillar nuclear bodies are induced.

Here, we apply the pair correlation function analysis (pCF) to measure molecular anisotropic diffusion in the interphase nucleus of live cells. In the pCF method, we cross-correlate fluctuations at several distances and locations within the nucleus, enabling us to define migration paths and barriers to diffusion. We use monomeric EGFP as a prototypical inert molecule and measure flow in and between different nuclear environments. Our results suggest that there are two disconnect molecular flows throughout the nucleus associated with high and low DNA density regions. We show that different density regions of DNA form a networked channel that allows EGFP to diffuse freely throughout, however with restricted ability to traverse the channel. We also observe rare and sudden bursts of molecules traveling across DNA density regions with characteristic time of ≈ 300 ms, suggesting intrinsic localized change in chromatin structure.

40|$|Mammalian genomes contain several {{dozens of}} large (> 0. 5 Mbp) lineage-specific gene loci {{harbouring}} functionally related genes. However, spatial chromatin folding, {{organization of the}} enhancer-promoter networks and their relevance to Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) in these loci remain poorly understood. TADs are principle units of the genome folding and represents the DNA regions within which DNA interacts more frequently and less frequently across the TAD boundary. Here, we used Chromatin Conformation Capture Carbon Copy (5 C) technology to characterize spatial <b>chromatin</b> interaction <b>network</b> in the 3. 1 Mb Epidermal Differentiation Complex (EDC) locus harbouring 61 functionally related genes that show lineage-specific activation during terminal keratinocyte differentiation in the epidermis. 5 C data validated by 3 D-FISH demonstrate that the EDC locus is organized into several TADs showing distinct lineage-specific <b>chromatin</b> interaction <b>networks</b> based on their transcription activity and the gene-rich or gene-poor status. Correlation of the 5 C results with genome-wide studies for enhancer-specific histone modifications (H 3 K 4 me 1 and H 3 K 27 ac) revealed {{that the majority of}} spatial chromatin interactions that involves the gene-rich TADs at the EDC locus in keratinocytes include both intra- and inter-TAD interaction networks, connecting gene promoters and enhancers. Compared to thymocytes in which the EDC locus is mostly transcriptionally inactive, these interactions were found to be keratinocyte-specific. In keratinocytes, the promoter-enhancer anchoring regions in the gene-rich transcriptionally active TADs are enriched for the binding of chromatin architectural proteins CTCF, Rad 21 and chromatin remodeler Brg 1. In contrast to gene-rich TADs, gene-poor TADs show preferential spatial contacts with each other, do not contain active enhancers and show decreased binding of CTCF, Rad 21 and Brg 1 in keratinocytes. Thus, spatial interactions between gene promoters and enhancers at the multi-TAD EDC locus in skin epithelial cells are cell type-specific and involve extensive contacts within TADs as well as between different gene-rich TADs, forming the framework for lineage-specific transcription...|$|R
40|$|The {{disruption}} of the BCR gene and its juxtaposition to and consequent activation of the ABL gene has been implicated as the critical molecular defect in Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias. The normal BCR protein is a multifunctional molecule with domains that suggest its participation in phosphokinase and GTP-binding pathways. Taken together with its localization to the cytoplasm of uncycled cells, it is therefore presumed {{to be involved in}} cytoplasmic signaling. By performing a double aphidicolin block for cell cycle synchronization, we currently demonstrate that the subcellular localization of BCR shifts from being largely cytoplasmic in interphase cells to being predominantly perichromosomal in mitosis. Furthermore, with the use of immunogold labeling and electron microscopy, association of BCR with DNA, in particular heterochromatin, can be demonstrated even in quiescent cells. Results were similar in cell lines of lymphoid or myeloid origin.

At {{the periphery of the}} nucleus a sharply defined granule is invariably found which has strong affinity for acid fuchsin. Mitosis begins with the duplication of this granule and the development inside the nucleus of a gradually lengthening fibre between the daughter granules.

Division of the chromatin has been studied in preparations stained with aceto orcein, directly or after hydrolysis. It proceeds through four phases, beginning with the condensation of distinct chromosomes from the <b>chromatin</b> <b>network</b> of the resting nuclei. Later the chromosomes become arranged in two parallel rows of chromatinic masses in which individual chromosomes can no longer be distinguished. Division is completed by migration of the chromatin to the ends of each row, giving the appearance of a transverse break in the double bar.

40|$|The {{architectural}} factors HMGA {{are highly}} connected hubs in the <b>chromatin</b> <b>network</b> and affect key cellular functions. HMGA have a causal involvement in cancer development; in fact, truncated or chimeric HMGA forms, resulting from chromosomal rearrangements, lack the constitutively phosphorylated acidic C-terminal tail and display increased oncogenic potential, suggesting a functional role for this domain. HMGA {{belong to the}} intrinsically disordered protein category, and this prevents the use of classical approaches to obtain structural data. Therefore, we combined limited proteolysis, ion mobility separation-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS), and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to obtain structural information regarding full length and C-terminal truncated HMGA forms. Limited proteolysis indicates that HMGA acidic tail shields the inner portions of the protein. IMS-MS and ESI-MS show that HMGA proteins can assume a compact form and {{that the degree of}} compactness is dependent upon the presence of the acidic tail and its constitutive phosphorylations. Moreover, we demonstrate that C-terminal truncated forms and wild type proteins are post-translationally modified in a different manner. Therefore, we propose that the acidic tail and its phosphorylation could affect HMGA post-translational modification status and likely their activity. Finally, the mass spectrometry-based approach adopted here proves to be a valuable new tool to obtain structural data regarding intrinsically disordered proteins...|$|E

Using specifically developed software, the reconstituted chromatin was interpreted in terms of nucleosomal patterns and the overall chromatin connectivity. The condensed chromatin formed from small DNA templates was characterized by aligned arrays of packed nucleosomal clusters having a typical 10 -nm spacing between nucleosomes within the same cluster and a 30 -nm spacing between nucleosomes in different clusters. A similar short-range nucleosomal clustering was also observed in condensed chromosomes; however, the clusters were smaller, and they were organized in 30 - to 40 -nm large domains. An analysis of the overall chromatin connectivity in condensed chromosomes showed that the 30 – 40 -nm domains are themselves organized into a regularly spaced and interconnected 3 D <b>chromatin</b> <b>network</b> that extends uniformly throughout the chromosomal volume, providing little indication of a systematic large-scale organization.

40|$|Epigenetic states {{constitute}} heritable {{features of}} the chromatin to regulate when, where and how genes are expressed in the developing conceptus. A special case of epigenetic regulation, genomic imprinting, is defined as parent of origin-dependent monoallelic expression. The Igf 2 -H 19 locus is considered as paradigm of genomic imprinting with a growth-promoting gene, Igf 2, expressed paternally and a growth antagonist, H 19 encoding a non-coding transcript, expressed only from the maternal allele. The monoallelic expression patterns are regulated by the epigenetic status at an imprinting control region (ICR) in the 5 ´-flank of the H 19 gene. The chromatin insulator protein CTCF interacts with only the maternal H 19 ICR allele to prevent downstream enhancers {{to communicate with the}} Igf 2 promoters. Mutations of these CTCF binding sites lead to biallelic Igf 2 expression, increased size of the conceptus and predisposition for cancer. Reasoning that these effects cannot be explained by the regulation of Igf 2 expression alone, a technique was invented to examine long-range chromatin interactions without prior knowledge of the interacting partners. Applying the circular chromosomal conformation capture (4 C) technique to mouse neonatal liver cells, it was observed that 114 unique sequences interacted with the H 19 ICR. A majority of these interactors was in complex with only the maternal H 19 ICR allele and depended on the presence of functional CTCF binding sites. The functional consequence of chromosomal networks was demonstrated by the observation that the maternal H 19 ICR allele regulated the transcription of two genes on another chromosome. As the chromosomal networks underwent reprogramming during the maturation of embryonic stem cells, attention was turned to human cancer cells, displaying features common with mouse embryonic stem cells. Subsequently, chromatin folding at the human H 19 ICR suggested that stable chromatin loops were organized by synergistic interactions within and between baits and interactors. The presence of these interactions was linked to DNA methylation patterns involving repeat elements. A "flower" model of <b>chromatin</b> <b>networks</b> was formulated to explain these observations. This thesis has unravealed a novel feature of the epigenome and its functions to regulate gene expression in trans. The identified roles for CTCF as an architectural factor in the organization of higher order chromatin conformations may be of importance in understanding development and disease ontogeny from novel perspectives...|$|R

The dynamical behavior of single chains on the lattice is investigated and Rouse scaling is verified. Dynamical dense networks are created by a combined version of the bond fluctuation method and a Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. Semidilute behavior of the dense chain networks is shown. By comparing diffusion of particles in a static and a dynamical chain network, we demonstrate that chain diffusion does not alter the diffusion process of small particles. However, we prove that a dynamical network facilitates the transport of large particles. By weighting the mean square displacement trajectories of particles in the static chain, network data from the dynamical network can be reconstructed. Additionally, it is shown that subdiffusive behavior of particles on short time scales results from trapping processes in the crowded environment of the chain network.

We previously described megabase replication N/U-domains as mammalian multiorigin replication units, and showed that their borders are 'master' replication initiation zones that likely initiate cascades of origin firing responsible for the stereotypic replication of these domains.

Nuclei are dense and filled with minute <b>chromatin</b> <b>network</b> and the nuclear membrane is not clear-cut. 2) The author divided the patterns of spindle cell movement into four types; namely, deformation of cell (type A), formation of membraneous projections (type B), trembling movement like Brown's movement (type C), and rotating movement (type D), and 7 subtypes; but all these patterns of movement resemble quite closely to those of normal platelets. 3) Spindle cells with type A movement are most numerous both in bone marrow and peripheral blood; and the maximum number of them appears in the early stage but it decreases along with the lapse of time. Because B and C types of movement appear more frequently in the later stages, A type seems to be the type of movement taken by spindle cells when their function is more active than the time when they take B and C types of movement. 4) Spindle cells of type D movement possessing cell body and nuclei both oval in shape with chromatin scattered around the nuclear membrane can be recognized only in bone-marrow culture but not in peripheral blood culture. Consequently this type is assumed to be an immature type. Moreover, no megakaryocytes can be detected in the bone marrow of chicken so that the author has interpreted those spindle cells belong to the independent cell system which mature from the immature type...|$|E
30|$|Emerging {{developments}} in technologies {{have made it}} possible to create high resolution genome-wide maps of physical interactions along genomic regions and ncRNAs. First of all, in the aspect of three-dimensional <b>chromatin</b> <b>network</b> research, advanced imaging technologies (for example single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization; single-molecule RNA-FISH) could examine subcellular localization of lncRNA Firre in embryonic stem cells (Hacisuleyman et al., 2014). Meanwhile, combination of technology innovations in probing the folding of chromosomes (such as 3 D-DSL and Hi-C) has uncovered an extensive, and previously underestimated network of local and long-range intrachromosomal loops and interchromosomal contacts. Howbeit, light microscopy just affords a resolution of 100 – 200 nm at best, which is insufficient to define clear chromosome conformation. Electron microscopy, while affording high resolution, is laborious and not easily applicable to study specific loci, not to mention the definite targets of lncRNAs. DNA binding proteins fused to different versions of green fluorescent proteins permit visualization of individual loci, but only a few positions can be examined simultaneously. Multiple loci can be visualized with FISH, but the resolution for different loci is about 1000 kb. Given the limitation of above techniques and based on the physical crosslinking in the close region of inter/intra-chromosome, the series of high-throughput 3 C-associated methodologies can be used to analyze the overall spatial organization of chromosomes and to investigate their physical properties at high resolution in a more systematic and unbiased manner. Notwithstanding, a common problem in all of these techniques is the requirement of a great number of cells, especially in the high-throughput methodologies. Single cell Hi-C method has thus been developed (Nagano et al., 2013), which effectively bridge current gaps between genomics and microscopy studies of chromosomes. Secondly, in the study of lncRNAs function, RNA microarray plays a prominent role in providing reliable and sensitive results to discover the mechanism studies of lncRNAs. With accurate probe annotations and designs to distinguish splicing variants and detect ncRNAs, microarray analysis can get pretty close to what RNA-Seq or lncRNAs-Seq can offer at a significantly lower cost. The mature software and normalization techniques make analyzing RNA microarray data seem like a breeze. However, microarrays only indicate known and relative rather than absolute transcript levels. If we want to assess rare and whole transcripts, GRO-Seq and lncRNA-Seq are better options: the dynamic range is orders of magnitude greater than that of microarrays. We believe that the cost and complication of analysis can improve over time, and with the advent of third generation sequencing, which has a lower rate of sequencing error (not enzyme based) and no need for amplification, the future of GRO-Seq and lncRNA-Seq will certainly be promising.|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe role of male {{germ cell}} death in {{spermatogenesis}} {{is an important}} one as it removes dysfunctional or genetically damaged germ cells and is necessary to maintain an optimal germ cell to Sertoli cell ratio. The formation of the bloodtestis barrier requires the elimination of excessive germ cells and a surge of germ cell apoptosis occurs prior to puberty regulating the ratio of germ cells to Sertoli cells. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the presence of four apoptotic markers on sperm from patients with various grades of fertility using flow cytometry. Furthermore, any correlations between the apoptotic marker assays and the standard semen analysis results were identified. This study compares early and late parameters of apoptosis with morphological features in spermatozoa in the same samples. The three sample groups were identified as: teratozoospermic [G-pattern] (n= 26), teratozoospermic [P-pattern] (n= 98) and oligoteratozoospermic [Ppattern] (n= 36). Standard semen analysis was conducted on the semen samples according to the WHO guidelines. Four apoptotic marker assays using flow cytometry was applied in this study to examine the apoptotic alterations in ejaculate sperm. These assays included the Annexin-V staining for the determination of phosphatidylserine exposure, APO-Direct to identify DNA fragmentation, caspase- 3 to detect expression of this active protease during early apoptosis and Fas expression. For the Annexin-V and caspase- 3 assays, statistically significant differences (P 0. 05) were found between the groups with respect to the APO-Direct assay. A significant difference (P< 0. 05) was found when comparing the teratozoospermic [G-pattern] group and the oligoteratozoospermic [P-pattern] group for the Fas assay. A strong positive correlation was evident between the Fas and the caspase- 3 assays in the teratozoospermic [G-pattern] group. For the teratozoospermic [P-pattern group] the following positive correlations existed between the APO-Direct and the Fas assays, APO-Direct and caspase- 3 assays and between caspase- 3 and Fas assays. The only strong positive correlation was between the caspase- 3 and APO-Direct assays in the oligoteratozoospermic [P-pattern] group. The presence of spermatozoa showing microscopic features resembling apoptosis has been identified in ten human ejaculate samples per sample group. Electron microscopy was used to identify morphological features of apoptosis in these human sperm samples. Classical apoptosis as observed in diploid cells could be identified in sperm and these included: loose fibrillarmicrogranular <b>chromatin</b> <b>network,</b> presence of vacuoles in the nuclear chromatin, membranous bodies within the vacuoles of the chromatin, partially disrupted nuclear membranes, plasma membrane protuberances and apoptotic bodies containing cytoplasmic vacuoles and dense masses. This study has confirmed that semen samples with abnormal semen parameters exhibit the presence of apoptotic markers in sperm. The identification of apoptotic markers on the sperm suggests that abnormalities occur during their developmental process, however, the exact mechanism thereof remains unclear. These findings may suggest that certain apoptotic markers may be an indicator of abnormal sperm function and possibly indicative of male infertility. South Afric...|$|E
40|$|Our {{knowledge}} {{of the role of}} higher-order chromatin structures in transcription of microRNA genes (MIRs) is evolving rapidly. Here we investigate the effect of 3 D architecture of chromatin on the transcriptional regulation of MIRs. We demonstrate that MIRs have transcriptional features that are similar to protein-coding genes. RNA polymerase II-associated ChIA-PET data reveal that many groups of MIRs and protein-coding genes are organized into functionally compartmentalized chromatin communities and undergo coordinated expression when their genomic loci are spatially colocated. We observe that MIRs display widespread communication in those transcriptionally active communities. Moreover, miRNA-target interactions are significantly enriched among communities with functional homogeneity while depleted from the same community from which they originated, suggesting MIRs coordinating function-related pathways at posttranscriptional level. Further investigation demonstrates the existence of spatial MIR-MIR <b>chromatin</b> interacting <b>networks.</b> We show that groups of spatially coordinated MIRs are frequently from the same family and involved in the same disease category. The spatial interaction network possesses both common and cell-specific subnetwork modules that result from the spatial organization of chromatin within different cell types. Together, our study unveils an entirely unexplored layer of MIR regulation throughout the human genome that links the spatial coordination of MIRs to their co-expression and function. © The Author(s) 2013...|$|R
40|$|The human mixed lineage leukemia- 5 (MLL 5) gene is {{frequently}} deleted in myeloid malignancies. Emerging {{evidence suggests that}} MLL 5 has important functions in adult hematopoiesis and the <b>chromatin</b> regulatory <b>network,</b> and it participates in regulating the cell cycle machinery. Here, we demonstrate that MLL 5 is tightly regulated through phosphorylation on its central domain at the G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle. Upon entry into mitosis, the phosphorylated MLL 5 delocalizes from condensed chromosomes, whereas after mitotic exit, MLL 5 becomes dephosphorylated and re-associates with the relaxed chromatin. We further identify that the mitotic phosphorylation and subcellular localization of MLL 5 are dependent on Cdc 2 kinase activity, and Thr- 912 is the Cdc 2 -targeting site. Overexpression of the Cdc 2 -targeting MLL 5 fragment obstructs mitotic entry by competitive inhibition of the phosphorylation of endogenous MLL 5. In addition, G 2 phase arrest caused by depletion of endogenous MLL 5 can be compensated by exogenously overexpressed full-length MLL 5 but not the phosphodomain deletion or MLL 5 -T 912 A mutant. Our data provide evidence that MLL 5 is a novel cellular target of Cdc 2, and the phosphorylation of MLL 5 may have an indispensable role in the mitotic progression...|$|R
40|$|Quiescent muscle {{progenitors}} called satellite cells {{persist in}} adult skeletal muscle and, upon injury to muscle, re-enter the cell cycle and either undergo self-renewal or differentiate to regenerate lost myofibers. Using synchronized cultures of C 2 C 12 myoblasts to model these divergent programs, {{we show that}} p 8 (also known as Nupr 1), a G 1 -induced gene, negatively regulates the cell cycle and promotes myogenic differentiation. p 8 is a small chromatin protein related to the high mobility group (HMG) family of architectural factors and binds to histone acetyltransferase p 300 (p 300, also known as CBP). We confirm this interaction and show that p 300 -dependent events (Myc expression, global histone acetylation and post-translational acetylation of the myogenic regulator MyoD) are all affected in p 8 -knockdown myoblasts, correlating with repression of MyoD target-gene expression and severely defective differentiation. We report two new partners for p 8 that support a role in muscle-specific gene regulation: p 68 (Ddx 5), an RNA helicase reported to bind both p 300 and MyoD, and MyoD itself. We show that, similar to MyoD and p 300, p 8 and p 68 are located at the myogenin promoter, and that knockdown of p 8 compromises chromatin association of all four proteins. Thus, p 8 represents a new node in a <b>chromatin</b> regulatory <b>network</b> that coordinates myogenic differentiation with cell-cycle exit...|$|R
