Crystals are of a bright hyacinth-red color, translucent, and have an adamantine to vitreous lustre. On exposure to UV light some of the translucency and brilliancy is lost. The streak is orange-yellow; Mohs hardness is 2.5-3; and the specific gravity is 6.0.It was discovered at the Berezovskoe Au Deposit (Berezovsk Mines) near Ekaterinburg in the Urals in 1766; and named crocoise by F. S. Beudant in 1832, from the Greek κρόκος (krokos), saffron, in allusion to its color, a name first altered to <b>crocoisite</b> and afterwards to crocoite. In the type locality the crystals are found in gold-bearing quartz-veins traversing granite or gneiss and associated with crocoite are quartz, embreyite, phoenicochroite and vauquelinite. Phoenicochroite is a basic lead chromate, Pb2CrO5 with dark red crystals, and vauquelinite a lead and copper phosphate-chromate, Pb2CuCrO4PO4OH, with brown or green monoclinic crystals. Vauquelinite was named after L. N. Vauquelin, who in 1797 discovered (simultaneously with and independently of M. H. Klaproth) the element chromium in crocoite.|$|E
40|$|The present {{contribution}} to the mineralogy of this State is of somewhat unusual interest, inasmuch as it describes {{for the first time}} an apparently new compound, which, although of no commercial value, is of some scientific interest. It is in its way a humble congener of the more imposing <b>crocoisite,</b> for the occurrence of which, in such magnificent developments, this island has obtained a great repute among mineralogists {{in all parts of the}} world, but, like it, is simply of scientific importance. The Lefroy meteorite, now mentioned for the first time, is, although of such remarkably small size, worthy of special note, and its detection in the prospector's dish adds another to the romantic discoveries of such objects from unknown space. The paper is an analysis of Bellite and Hercynite, undertaken by Mr. J. D. Millen, A. S. T. C, M. S. C. I., Lond., metallurgical chemist. Includes notes on additional localities for a few others which are already on record are given, with some remarks on peculiar features presented by some few others...|$|E
