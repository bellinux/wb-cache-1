Organisms in which a particular chromosome, or chromosome segment, is under- or overrepresented are said to be aneuploid (from the Greek words meaning [...] "not", [...] "good", and [...] "fold"). Therefore, the distinction between aneuploidy and polyploidy is that aneuploidy {{refers to a}} numerical change in part of the <b>chromosome</b> <b>set,</b> whereas polyploidy refers to a numerical change in the whole set of chromosomes.|$|E

40|$|Meiosis I {{in males}} of the Dipteran Sciara coprophila {{results in the}} nonrandom {{distribution}} of maternally and paternally derived <b>chromosome</b> <b>sets</b> to the two division products. Based on an earlier study (Kubai, D. F. 1982. J. Cell Biol. 93 : 655 - 669), I suggested that the meiosis I spindle does not play a direct role in the nonrandom sorting of chromosomes but that, instead, haploid sets are already separated in prophase nuclei well {{before the onset of}} spindle formation. Here I report more direct evidence that this hypothesis is true; this evidence was gained from ultrastructural reconstruction analyses of the arrangement of chromosomes in germ line nuclei (prophase nuclei in spermatogonia and spermatocytes) of males heterozygous for an X- autosome chromosome translocation. Because of this translocation, the maternal and paternal <b>chromosome</b> <b>sets</b> are distinguishable, so it is possible to demonstrate that (a) the two haploid <b>chromosome</b> <b>sets</b> occupy distinct maternal and paternal nuclear compartments and that (b) nuclei are oriented so that the two haploid <b>chromosome</b> <b>sets</b> have consistent relationships to a well-defined cellular axis. The consequences of such nonrandom aspects of nuclear structure for chromosome behavior on premeiotic and meiotic spindles are discussed...|$|R

50|$|A unique {{reproductive}} tactic for the Bluespotted-Jefferson Salamander Complex {{exists in}} nature. The Jefferson salamander {{is now known}} not to breed in the lab with the blue-spotted salamander, which was previously thought to produce 'hybrids', the silvery salamander and Tremblay's salamander, between this supposed mating of Jefferson salamander and Blue-spotted salamander. The silvery salamander and Tremblay's salamander are now known through genetic testing to be polyploid females (only 2% of males survive and they are sterile). These most often possess two of each chromosome from the Jefferson salamander and one of each chromosome from the blue-spotted salamander, resulting in an LJJ genotype (also called a Tremblay's salamander.) This genotype results when these polyploid females mate with a pure Jefferson salamander male, incorporating (often in warmer water conditions) the chromosome from the pure male Jefferson salamander into her egg, usually having an LJ diploid <b>chromosome</b> <b>set</b> or LJJ triploid <b>chromosome</b> <b>set,</b> to produce LJJ or LJJJ offspring, respectively. Often in cooler conditions, the LJ or LJJ female may mate with the Jefferson salamander male and only 'borrow' his spermatozoan to trigger genetic cloning of herself, not adding his chromosome (J) to her egg. The same polyploid reproductive strategy occurs for other mole salamander species. The presence of these polyploids {{makes it difficult to}} visually identify which species an individual may be, skewing population measures for both species.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of chromosome structure upon pairing behaviour during meiosis was investigated by comparing four autotetraploid genotypes of rye (Secale cereale) containing homologous <b>chromosome</b> <b>sets</b> with {{different degrees of}} structural similarity. The series provided a range of genotypes that, at one extreme, contained structurally identical <b>chromosome</b> <b>sets</b> and, at the other extreme, sets that are certainly more heterozygous in the genic sense and probably also more diverse from a purely structural viewpoint. Relative frequencies of pairing configurations at meiotic prophase and metaphase I were compared by electron microscopy of whole-mount surface-spread synaptonemal complex complements and light microscopy of squash preparations. Despite unexpectedly low quadrivalent frequencies over all four genotypes, higher mean bivalent frequencies appeared {{to be associated with}} greater homologue diversity. In other words, greater structural divergence between <b>chromosome</b> <b>sets</b> appears to facilitate more efficient discrimination between homologous and identical chromosomes that drives the formation of bivalents.

50|$|Genetics {{are more}} {{variable}} and malleable in plants than in animals, probably reflecting the higher activity level in animals. Hybrids genetics will necessarily be less stable {{than those of}} species evolving through isolation, which explains why hybrid species appear more common in plants than in animals. Many agricultural crops are hybrids with double or even triple <b>chromosome</b> <b>sets.</b> Having multiple <b>sets</b> of <b>chromosomes</b> is called polyploidy (or polyploidity). Polyploidy is usually fatal in animals where extra <b>chromosome</b> <b>sets</b> upset fetal development, but is often found in plants. A form of hybrid speciation that is relatively common in plants, occurs when an infertile hybrid becomes fertile after doubling of the chromosome number.|$|R

More particularly, this study demonstrates the nonrandom positioning of metaphase chromosomes bearing nucleolar organizer regions as revealed by their positive upstream binding factor immunolabeling.

50|$|Polar bodies {{serve to}} {{eliminate}} {{one half of}} the diploid <b>chromosome</b> <b>set</b> produced by meiotic division in the egg, leaving behind a haploid cell. To produce the polar bodies, the cell must divide asymmetrically, which is fueled by furrowing (formation of a trench) near a particular point on the cell membrane. The presence of chromosomes induces the formation of an actomyosin cortical cap, a myosin II ring structure and a set of spindle fibers, the rotation of which promotes invagination {{at the edge of the}} cell membrane and splits the polar body away from the oocyte.|$|E
50|$|Genetically {{this system}} is {{equivalent}} both to haplodiploid arrhenotoky where the males are haploid and develop from unfertilized eggs and to certain cases of diploid arrhenotoky where the males get a diploid set <b>chromosome</b> <b>set</b> from their mother but inactivate and fail to pass on half of them. Pseudo-arrhenotoky causes a female's genetic contribution to her son's children to double. This intragenomic conflict between maternal and paternal genes can lead to pseudo-arrhenotoky arising. Under conditions where the optimal sex ratio is biased, pseudo-arrhenotoky allows the female a precise control of the ratio of sons to daughters. Pseudo arrhenotoky has evolved into haplodiploidy (haploid arrhenotoky) in some species possibly due to sustained intragenomic conflict or due to pressure to colonize habitats by a single unmated female. Relative to arrhenotoky, pseudo-arrhenotoky may {{have the advantage of}} allowing DNA damage to be repaired.|$|E
5000|$|A {{complete}} mole {{is caused}} by a single (incidence is about 90%) or two (incidence is about 10%) sperm combining with an egg which has lost its DNA (the sperm then reduplicates forming a [...] "complete" [...] 46 <b>chromosome</b> <b>set).</b> The genotype is typically 46,XX (diploid) due to subsequent mitosis of the fertilizing sperm, but can also be 46,XY (diploid). 46,YY (diploid) is not observed. In contrast, a partial mole occurs when a haploid egg is fertilized by two sperm or by one sperm which reduplicates itself yielding the genotypes of 69,XXY (triploid) or 92,XXXY (tetraploid). [...] Complete hydatidiform moles have 2.5% risk of developing into choriocarcinoma, but also a 10% chance of becoming an invasive mole.

40|$|Triploid {{plants are}} usually highly aborted owing to {{unbalanced}} meiotic chromosome segregation, but limited viable gametes {{can participate in}} the transition to different ploidy levels. In this study, numerous meiotic abnormalities were found with high frequency in an intersectional allotriploid poplar (Populus alba × P. berolinensis 'Yinzhong'), including univalents, precocious chromosome migration, lagging chromosomes, chromosome bridges, micronuclei, and precocious cytokinesis, indicating high genetic imbalance in this allotriploid. Some micronuclei trigger mini-spindle formation in metaphase II and participate in cytokinesis to form polyads with microcytes. Unbalanced chromosome segregation and chromosome elimination resulted {{in the formation of}} microspores with aneuploid <b>chromosome</b> <b>sets.</b> Fusion of sister nuclei occurs in microsporocytes with precocious cytokinesis, which could form second meiotic division restitution (SDR) -type gametes. However, SDR-type gametes likely contain incomplete <b>chromosome</b> <b>sets</b> due to unbalanced segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division in triploids. Misorientation of spindles during the second meiotic division, such as fused and tripolar spindles with low frequency, could result in the formation of first meiotic division restitution (FDR) -type unreduced gametes, which most likely contain three complete <b>chromosome</b> <b>sets.</b> Although 'Yinzhong' yields 88. 7 % stainable pollen grains with wide diameter variation from 23. 9 to 61. 3 μm, the pollen viability is poor (2. 78 % ± 0. 38).
