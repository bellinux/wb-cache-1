40|$|Concretes used {{in marine}} {{environment}} are generally under the cyclic effect of CO 2 and chloride ions (Cl -). To date, {{the influence of}} carbonation on ingress of chloride ions in concretes has been widely studied; in comparison, study {{on the influence of}} Cl - on the progress of carbonation is limited. During the study, concretes were exposed to independent and combined mechanisms of carbonation and chloride ingress regimes. Profiles of apparent pH and chloride concentration were used to indicate the progress of carbonation and ingress of Cl - in concretes. From the apparent pH profile, a carbonation front and a carbonation boundary were characterized according to profile of consumed hydroxyl ions (OH -). Results show that carbonation was significantly slowed down due to the existence of Cl -, viz. the depth of carbonation boundary was decreased; the profile of consumed OH - became modest; the carbonation front for different mixes presented slightly different trends. For the sound concretes, carbonation generated microcracks on concrete surface and increased permeation properties; for the chloride <b>contaminated</b> <b>concretes,</b> due to the limited extent of carbonation, permeation properties did not present obvious difference...|$|R
40|$|The current {{practice}} of landfilling thermally treated and untreated coal tar-contaminated soil is expensive, {{and it is}} a waste of a potentially useful material and landfill space. A less expensive and possibly more practical alternative is to use coal tar-contaminated soil as an aggregate in concrete. Because little work has been done in this area, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of coal tar-contamination and thermal treatment on the physical properties of soil and the strength of <b>concrete</b> containing <b>contaminated</b> soil as an aggregate. Also assessed was the leachability of coal tar constituents (specifically, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) from <b>contaminated</b> soil, <b>concrete</b> containing <b>contaminated</b> soil, and <b>concrete</b> containing thermally-treated <b>contaminated</b> soil. Mechanical sieve analyses and direct shear tests showed no significant change in grain size distribution or internal friction angle for contaminated and uncontaminated soil treated at 250 and 550 Compressive and splitting tensile strength tests performed on concrete specimens showed a slight decrease in strength with the degree of incorporation of <b>contaminated</b> aggregate. <b>Concrete</b> compressive strength, elastic modulus, and tensile strength also decreased as the aggregate treatment temperature increased, especially at temperatures in excess of 450 However, the strength decreases were small (less than 15 %), and the concrete strength was still within typical values for structural concrete. The leachability tests showed that as treatment temperature was increased, levels of PAHs in the soil significantly decreased. From the leachability tests performed on samples of crushed <b>concrete</b> that contained <b>contaminated</b> soil, it appears that only low molecular weight PAHs (i. e., less than or equal tol 66 g/mol) were stabilized by the concrete. The poor stabilization of higher molecular weight PAHs may be an artifact of the sample preparation method which required that the concrete be crushed prior to leaching...|$|R

40|$|In {{majority}} of exposure environments for concrete structures, {{there is a}} high probability of the cyclic occurance of both chloride ingress and carbonation. This paper reports a detailed investigation on the influence of carbonation on both the ingress and distribution of chlorides in three different types of concretes, by comparing results from exposure to chlorides, chlorides before carbonation and chlorides after carbonation. Concretes studied were of 0. 55 water-binder ratio with 100 % Portland Cement (PC), 70 % PC + 30 % pulverized fuel ash (PFA) and 85 % PC + 10 % PFA + 5 % microsilica (MS) as binders. Chloride profiles were compared to assess the effects of all variables studied in this research. The effect of carbonation was quantified by measuring the consumption of hydroxyl ions (OH-), air permeability and chloride migration coefficient. The results indicated that carbonation of concrete increases chloride transport, but the precise nature of this is dependent on the combined regime as well as the type of binder. In general, it was found that carbonation of chloride <b>contaminated</b> <b>concretes</b> results in a decrease of their chloride binding capacity, that is it releases the bound Cl- in concretes and pushes chlorides inwards, as has been established previously by other researchers. However, it is established in this research that the combined regimes detrimentally affect the service life of concrete structures, particularly when chloride induced corrosion is a concern...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{degradation}} problems in concrete structures is chloride initiated reinforcement corrosion resulting in cracked, spalled and delaminated concrete. Thesedamages are repaired for {{large amounts of money}} and because of high repair costs it is important to perform durable repairs. This thesis work has included interviews, laboratory and field studies in the area of concrete repairs. The interviews were held mainly with bridge engineers at the Swedish Road Administration and Banverket (the Swedish Railway Administration). The questions asked tothese people were about their experience in the field of concrete repairs. The objective withthe interview study was to collect knowledge and experience about concrete repair at these two governmental authorities. The main objective of the laboratory study was to investigate chloride transport in the transition zone between a chloride <b>contaminated</b> substrate <b>concrete</b> and an initially chloride free repair concrete by establishing chloride profiles. The second objective was to detect any reinforcement corrosion in relation to the transition zone. The reinforced laboratory specimens with premixed chlorides (1 or 4 wt % per cement) in the substrate concrete have been exposed during 13 years either outdoors or in a climate chamber with relative humidity of 80 %. The main results show that reinforcement corrosion occurred in and near the transition zone in local active areas with passive areas between, macrocell corrosion, and that the chlorides are transported from the <b>contaminated</b> substrate <b>concrete</b> into the repair concrete. Three different repaired concrete structures, one road bridge, one pedestrian bridge and one parking structure, were investigated in the field study. All three structures are treated with deicing agents in the winter time. The objective with the field study was to investigate if the same phenomenon can be observed as in the laboratory study. The main conclusions, from the investigation on drilled cores from each structure, are that chlorides in <b>contaminated</b> substrate <b>concrete</b> can be transported into a repair concrete and reinforcement corrosion may occur in the transition zone between the two different materials. The results are in accordance with the results in the laboratory study. It was also seen that a repair concrete with relative low w/cratio may reduce the ingress of external chlorides. Finally, the results in this thesis indicate that there is a risk for reinforcement corrosion {{in the vicinity of the}} transition zone between repair concrete and a substrate concrete which must be considered in concrete repair work. For example the chloride content around a repair must not exceed a certain level when a repair is performed. The chloride transport into the repair concrete can be useful to transport chlorides and reduce the content of chlorides in the substrate concrete. The advantages with this are that the amount of removed <b>contaminated</b> substrate <b>concrete</b> can be minimized and the risk for corrosion in the substrate concrete is lower. If the repair concrete is reinforced with conventional black steel there may on the other hand be a risk for corrosion in the repair concrete instead if high levels of chlorides are transported. Also external exposure of chlorides must be considered for the risk of corrosion in the repair material. Further research is needed about when different corrosion mechanisms and chloride diffusion mechanisms occur in reinforced concrete repairs. The experience from the used analyzing methods in the laboratory investigations are possible to use in coming research projects in the field of concrete repair. The next step after this thesis work should be in order to increase the understanding of the repaired concrete system including the important compatibility issues, the author believes that the most fruitful way consists of further laboratory investigations, field studies and optimisation of the repair material.

The results indicate that neither the DOE dose limit of 100 mrem/yr nor the 15 -mrem/yr dose constraint would be exceeded for any of the cases. The potential maximum dose rates for cases A, B, C, and D are 0. 000028, 0. 015, 0. 018, and 0. 17 mrem/yr, respectively.

40|$|Certain radioisotopes can {{penetrate}} <b>concrete</b> and <b>contaminate</b> the <b>concrete</b> {{well below}} the surface. The challenge {{is to determine the}} extent and magnitude of the contamination problem in real-time. The concrete profiling technology, TRUPROSM in conjunction with portable radiometric instrumentation produces a profile of radiological or chemical contamination through the material being studied. The data quality, quantity, and representativeness may be used to produce an activity profile from the hot spot surface into the material being sampled. This activity profile may then be expanded to ultimately characterize the facility and expedite waste segregation and facility closure at a reduced cost and risk. Performing a volumetric concrete or metal characterization safer and faster (without lab intervention) is the objective of this characterization technology. This way of determining contamination can save considerable time and money. Currently, concrete core bores are shipped to certified laboratories where the concrete residue is run through a battery of tests to determine the contaminants. The existing core boring operation volatilizes or washes out some of the contaminants (like tritium) and oftentimes cross-contaminates the area around the core bore site. The volatilization of the contaminants can lead to airborne problems in the immediate vicinity of the core bore. Cross-contamination can increase the contamination area and thereby increase the amount of waste generated. The goal is to avoid those field activities that could cause this type of release...|$|R

Sixty specimens were designed with seven admixed chloride contents, three concrete cover depths, two reinforcing steel bar diameters, two exposure conditions, and a typical concrete {{with water to}} cement ratio of 0. 45. Corrosion current density (corrosion rate), corrosion potential, ohmic resistance of concrete and temperature were measured monthly on these specimens using both the 3 LP and Gecor devices. Metal loss measurements were performed in accordance with ASTM G 1 - 90, method C 3. 5, after specimens cracked. The actual corrosion weight loss of the steel reinforcing bars was then compared to the result obtained from the corrosion rate measurement devices. An interaction model for characterizing the dynamic corrosion process was developed based on the five-year corrosion database. The model demonstrates that the corrosion rate {{is a function of}} chloride content, temperature at reinforcement depth, ohmic resistance of concrete, and corrosion time after initiation.

The influence of several reinforcement and substrate primer systems upon macro-cell corrosion, arising from an incipient anode, within a patch repair have been investigated. Measurements of electrochemical noise were made in order to investigate the suitability of the technique as an on-site means of assessing corrosion activity within chloride <b>contaminated</b> reinforced <b>concrete.</b> For this purpose the standard deviation of potential noise was compared to macro-cell galvanic current data and micro-cell corrosion intensity determined by linear polarisation. Hydroxyl ion pore solution analyses were carried out on mortar taken from cathodically protected specimens. These specimens, containing sodium chloride, were cathodically protected over a range of polarisation potentials. Measurement of the hydroxyl ion concentrations were made in order to examine the possibility of alkali-silica reactions initiated by cathodic protection of reinfored concrete. A range of mortars containing a variety of generic type additives were examined in order to establish their resistances to chloride ion diffusion. The effect of surfactant addition rate was investigated within a cement paste containing various dosages of naphthalene sulphonate...|$|R
