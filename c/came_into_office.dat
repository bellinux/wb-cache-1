A {{few weeks before the}} war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution. Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Tătărescu became Foreign Minister {{and vice}} {{president}} of the government in the cabinet of Petru Groza when the latter <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>office</b> after Soviet pressures in 1945; his faction had been awarded leadership of four other ministries — Finance, with three successive office-holders (of whom the last was Alexandru Alexandrini), Public Works, with Gheorghe Vântu, Industry (with Petre N. Bejan), and Religious Affairs, with Radu Roșculeț. He indirectly helped the PCR carry out an electoral fraud during the general election in 1946 by failing to reply to American proposals for organizing fair elections. At the Paris Conference, where he was accompanied by the PCR leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and Pătrășcanu, he acknowledged the dissolution of Greater Romania under the provisions of the new Treaty (1947).|$|E

5|$|Taylor and his Secretary of State, John M. Clayton, both lacked {{diplomatic}} experience, and <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>office</b> at {{a relatively}} uneventful time in American–international politics. Their shared nationalism allowed Taylor to devolve foreign policy matters to Clayton with minimal oversight, although no decisive foreign policy was established under their administration. As opponents of the autocratic European order, they vocally supported German and Hungarian liberals in the revolutions of 1848, although they offered {{little in the way}} of aid. A perceived insult from the French minister Guillaume Tell Poussin nearly led to a break in diplomatic relations until Poussin was replaced, and a reparation dispute with Portugal resulted in harsh words from the Taylor administration. In a more positive effort, the administration arranged for two ships to assist in the United Kingdom's search for a team of British explorers, led by John Franklin, who had gotten lost in the Arctic. While previous Whig administrations had emphasized Pacific trade as an economic imperative, the Taylor administration took no major initiative in the Far East.|$|E
5|$|The DDL {{project was}} {{reviewed}} {{again when the}} Liberal Fraser Government <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>office</b> in late 1975. The review panel unanimously advised the new Minister for Defence James Killen that the DDL project was no longer viable as {{the total cost of}} the ships would be about $130 million higher than the Oliver Hazard Perry project, and it would take three years longer for the DDLs to be completed. Killen accepted this advice, and a firm order for two Oliver Hazard Perry frigates was placed in February 1976. A third ship was ordered in late 1977. Six of these frigates, which were designated the , were eventually ordered, and the final two were built in Australia at Williamstown. The expertise of the DDL project office and the preparations which had been undertaken to manage the process of ordering and building the ships contributed to the Navy's ability to rapidly evaluate alternative designs and oversee their entry into service once an order was placed.|$|E

25|$|Frondizi's {{development}} of Argentina's sizable petroleum reserves {{was used to}} foster nationalism among voters as well as strengthen the economy. When Frondizi <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>office</b> in 1958, oil production had not grown significantly since the sometimes abusive Standard Oil was forced out in the 1930s. As Argentina relied more on motor vehicles, oil imports drained the country in foreign exchange. How to achieve increased oil production was a contentious issue by the 1940s. The UCR (Radical Civic Union) favoured a state monopoly, believing it necessary to control the oil reserves. In the Declaration of Avellaneda (a common platform supported by Balbin's UCRPhis wing of the UCRand Frondizi's UCRI), the state's need to invest in oil exploration and to make Argentina self-sufficient {{in the short term}} was expressed as policy.|$|E
25|$|In the 1870s and the 1880s, the American economists Richard Ely, John Bates Clark and Henry Carter Adams—influenced both by {{socialism}} and the Evangelical Protestant movement—castigated the conditions caused by industrial factories and expressed sympathy towards labor unions. However, none developed a systematic political philosophy and they later abandoned their flirtations with socialist thinking. In 1883, Lester Frank Ward published the two-volume Dynamic Sociology and formalized the basic tenets of social liberalism {{while at the}} same time attacking the laissez-faire policies advocated by Herbert Spencer and William Graham Sumner. The historian Henry Steele Commager ranked Ward alongside William James, John Dewey and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. and called him the father of the modern welfare state. Writing from 1884 until the 1930s, John Dewey—an educator influenced by Hobhouse, Green and Ward—advocated socialist methods to achieve liberal goals. Some social liberal ideas were later incorporated into the New Deal, which developed as a response to the Great Depression, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1921, Snively became a {{candidate}} for mayor of Duluth, was elected, and kept the position {{for a total of}} sixteen years--a record for Duluth mayors. Snively was sixty-one years old when {{he was elected to the}} office, and his first proclamation as mayor was his promise to make Duluth the most beautiful city in the Northwest, if not the country. The completion and promotion of Skyline Parkway, the city's hilltop boulevard, became Snively's personal project throughout his four terms in office. The idea for the city-wide boulevard is credited to William King Rogers of Ohio, who also oversaw construction of its initial segment from 1889 to 1891. After that, work on the boulevard fell off, and was piecemeal at best until Snively <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>office.</b> During his administration, the boulevard's expansion served as both a way to beautify the city and provide jobs during tough economic times in the 1930s.|$|E

500|$|It was Martin Leake's {{opinion that}} the trouble and {{opposition}} Anstis met with in establishing himself as Garter so embittered him against the heralds that when at last in 1718 he succeeded, he made it his prime object to aggrandise himself and his office at their expense. It is clear at least that {{he set out to}} make himself indispensable to the Earl Marshal, which was not hard, their political principles being congruous and their friendship already established, but also to Sir Robert Walpole and the Whig ministry, which can by no means have been easy, considering his known attachment to the Pretender and the circumstances under which he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>office</b> ... The main object of Anstis's next move, the revival or institution of the Order of the Bath was probably that which it in fact secured, of ingratiating him with the all-powerful Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole.|$|E

500|$|Prohibition {{had been}} {{introduced}} in Alberta following a 1916 referendum, during which the UFA had advocated for the prohibitionist side. [...] The Liberal version of prohibition was weak, and Greenfield <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>office</b> intending to strengthen the legislation. [...] Even by 1920, however, it was becoming apparent that the policy was not working (or, as the Medicine Hat News noted, [...] "Prohibition is now working smoothly. [...] The only thing left is to stop the sale of liquor!"). [...] Greenfield's own MLAs began to grumble about the policy—Archibald Matheson expressed in 1923 the view that [...] "This government has acted as philosopher, guide, and God to the people long enough." [...] Public opinion, too, began to shift against the policy, more rapidly after 1922 when three police officers {{were killed in the}} line of duty by bootleggers. [...] The last and most dramatic of these was the murder of Steve Lawson in front of the barracks where he and his family lived, by Emil [...] "Pic" [...] Picariello and Florence Lassandra. [...] Public opinion ran high both for and against the pair, and their 1923 hangings only served to unite both factions against prohibition.|$|E
500|$|The SmartBike DC bike sharing service, a {{predecessor}} to Capital Bikeshare, {{debuted in}} 2008 with 10 stations and 120 bicycles. It {{was the first}} of its kind in the United States. D.C. Department of Transportation Director Gabe Klein <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>office</b> four months later and he eager to expand it, but found the private partner had a [...] "lackluster commitment." [...] Because the agreement specifically prohibited DDOT from paying for anything related to SmartBike, an expansion required DDOT to renegotiate the contract. But in his first meeting with Clear Channel he found that Clear Channel believed they had gotten a bad deal on the original contract that created SmartBike; that following their purchase by Bain Capital they were no longer interested in [...] "municipal street furniture" [...] and that they had neither desire nor obligation to expand the program. In addition, it was difficult and expensive to install new stations, because they required the local utility company to bring electricity to each station. As a result, Klein chose to end the program and instead work with Arlington County, Virginia, to build a new, regional bikesharing program to be called Capital Bikeshare.|$|E
500|$|Daley <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>office</b> in a {{city with}} revenue-generating assets, {{manageable}} debt and flush pension funds, but he left behind a city with a structural deficit that Mayor-elect Rahm Emanuel estimated at $1.2 billion when under-funded pension funds were included. The Daley administration's expenditures exceeded revenues by {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} a year. In August 2010, Fitch Ratings downgraded the city's bond credit rating, citing the administration's use of reserve funds for general operating expenses and under-funding of its pension funds, and noted that the city faced rising fixed operating costs yet lacked plans for new revenue. Wall Street analysts noted that the Daley administration began drawing on the city's reserves as early as 2006, before the 2008–2012 global recession. [...] "While there had been sound economic growth in years prior to 2008, there were still sizable fund balance drawdowns in both 2006 and 2007," [...] Fitch wrote. The city's budgets continued to increase even after the recession began, to more than $6 billion a year, and, when under-funded city employee pension funds were included, the city's annual deficit exceeded $1 billion. In January 2011, Moody's Investors Service downgraded to a [...] "negative" [...] outlook some of the revenue bonds issued for the $15 billion O'Hare Modernization Program and related infrastructure projects, citing the city's plan to postpone repayment of interest and principal on some construction bonds.|$|E
