500|$|In C#, {{memory address}} {{pointers}} {{can only be}} used within blocks specifically marked <b>as</b> <b>unsafe,</b> <b>and</b> programs with <b>unsafe</b> code need appropriate permissions to run. Most object access is done through safe object references, which always either point to a [...] "live" [...] object or have the well-defined null value; {{it is impossible to}} obtain a reference to a [...] "dead" [...] object (one that has been garbage collected), or to a random block of memory. An unsafe pointer can point to an instance of a value-type, array, string, or a block of memory allocated on a stack. Code that is not marked <b>as</b> <b>unsafe</b> can still store and manipulate pointers through the System.IntPtr type, but it cannot dereference them.|$|R

50|$|Investigative {{journalist}} Bob Woffinden {{believed that}} it was a miscarriage of justice. An appeal in 1999 failed, but in May 2003 following a two-year investigation by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, Siôn's case was referred back to the Court of Appeal. The basis for the referral outlined in the Commission's Statement of Reasons was that: 'There is evidence, not before the jury, that suggests Mr Jenkins could not have committed the murder'. The second appeal in August 2004 was successful and the Court of Appeal quashed his original conviction <b>as</b> <b>unsafe</b> <b>and</b> ordered a retrial, with Jenkins being released on bail.|$|R
5000|$|During the Communist era, between 1955 and 1960, repairs {{were made}} to the monastery, {{restoring}} its interiors to the pure Romanesque style. The museum was opened in the west wing in 1977. Although the summer rectory was restored in 1985 and 1986, the damage to the remaining buildings was still severe. So in 1998 the entire complex had to be placed under the protection of the Bauaufsichtsbehörde Building Inspection Authority [...] <b>and</b> closed <b>as</b> <b>unsafe</b> <b>and</b> unfit. But more repairing and restoring measures in 1999 had the order lifted but they continued for several more years.|$|R

30|$|Splitting {{is known}} as a kind of brittle {{fracture}} in wood. Many researchers tried to clarify its mechanism, but it has not yet been made clear. In this research, compact tension tests on some wood species, such as Japanese cedar, Japanese cypress, Japanese larch and Douglas fir, were conducted and the fracture parameters Cγ of these woods were calculated. As a result, experimental values of Japanese larch were lower than calculated ones <b>and</b> were <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> <b>unsafe.</b> Furthermore, an evaluation method of splitting strength with compact tension test specimens was proposed. As a result, values calculated by the method for Japanese cedar and Japanese larch corresponded well to experimental ones, and the values by the proposed method for Japanese cypress and Douglas fir were judged {{to be on the safe}} side.|$|R
50|$|The Thames left Vardø in Norway on 26 July 1876. The ship {{entered the}} Yenisei River {{and reached the}} Kureika River on 18 October, too late to return home, so Wiggins secured the ship for the winter and {{traveled}} overland back to Britain. The Thames and its crew wintered 1876-1877 on the Yensei, and Wiggins returned {{to her at the}} end of April 1877. But she was frozen to the bottom and suffered damage on being freed; headed downriver, she then ran aground on 3 July 1877. Despite the crew's effort, the ship could not be saved, and she was sold for scrap (her main value being her boilers). The crew refused Wiggins's proffered schooner <b>as</b> <b>unsafe</b> <b>and</b> returned with him to Yeniseysk and thence home overland.|$|R
40|$|Dissertação de mestrado em Psicologia Clínica e de Saúde (Intervenções Cognitivo-Comportamentais nas Perturbações Psicológicas e de Saúde), apresentada à Faculdade de Psicologia e de Ciências da Educação da Universidade de CoimbraThis study {{explored}} the mediator role of external shame {{and fear of}} compassion from others in the link between early positive memories and current feelings of social safeness, {{in a sample of}} 400 women. Path analysis revealed that the ability to evoke early positive experiences is associated to a lower tendency to feel fear of receiving help and compassion from others and decreased feelings of inferiority, which seem to promote feelings of social safeness. These findings highlight the importance of addressing shame and fear of compassion, particularly when working with women who perceive the social world <b>as</b> <b>unsafe</b> <b>and</b> threatening...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} teacher targeted bullying in primary schools {{to examine whether}} students serve <b>as</b> an <b>unsafe</b> work stressor for teachers, because teacher targeted bullying is on the rise. This study looked at teacher targeted bullying as an antecedent of stress and the mechanisms, such as mediators and moderators, which affected this bullying-stress relationship. 113 primary school teachers completed a self-report questionnaire which measured bullying, self-efficacy, safety climate perceptions, social support and stress. The results provided evidence that social support from others outside work moderated the mow level bullying-stress, and severe bullying-stress relationships. Most importantly, unsafe job perceptions mediated the relationship between low level bullying and stress. The results of this research imply that student bullying can influence teachers to perceive their job <b>as</b> <b>unsafe</b> <b>and</b> lead to stress. These findings {{can be used to}} develop effective strategies to not only prevent and manage bullying, but create safer schools for teachers and pupils...|$|R

The Council then undertook a programme of improvement, the objective of which was the complete restoration of the Staircase Hall, Corridor and Saloon, (now called the Ballroom) {{with the help of a}} large grant from the Historic Buildings Council. The work was completed in 1961 and every detail of the Ballroom, except for the heaters and emergency exits, is now as it was originally completed in 1730. As well as providing office space {{the building}} was used for various community activities, which continued after it was taken over by the new Hambledon council in 1974.|$|R
40|$|We {{identified}} {{children ages}} 0 to 14 years injured in traffic as pedestrians or bicyclists in Montreal, Canada. Two hundred children with injuries {{who received a}} score of 2 or more on the Maximum Abbreviated Injury Severity scale were <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> cases and compared with 400 uninjured children seen in the same hospitals for non-traumatic reasons. Systematic, blinded interviews and tests were conducted with parents to determine {{the role of a}} series of social, familial, personal, and behavioral characteristics. After adjustment for age, gender and socioeconomic area of residence, logistic regression analyses showed higher risks of injury to be related to fewer years of parents' education, a history of accident to a family member, an environment judged <b>as</b> <b>unsafe,</b> <b>and</b> poor parental supervision. Absence of physical health problems, fewer family preventive behaviors and reported lack of cautiousness were also related to a higher risk, whereas neither aggressivity nor behavioral disturbance, whether internalizing or externalizing, showed any such relation. These data suggest that the child's personality and behavior are weaker risk factors for pedestrian and bicyclist injuries than are family and neighborhood characteristics...|$|R
