In this paper, this method {{was used to}} study the bioreactivity of PM 10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 /lm) and PM 2. 5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of less than 2. 5 /lm). Samples and dust storm particles were collected in 2001 in an urban area, a satellite city and a <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> <b>area</b> in Beijing.

40|$|Collection {{campaigns for}} PM 10 and PM 2. 5 have been {{conducted}} in a northwestern Beijing urban area in monthly periods over 2001, with 7 days collection per month. The samples were also collected simultaneously in a satellite city, Nankou, and a <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> <b>area</b> near the Ming Tombs Reservoir (MTR) over the domestic heating (March) and non-heating (July/August) periods in 2001 (both for one week). To assist the analysis, three types of ‘source’ particulate matter (PM) samples were taken. These consisted of coal combustion ash collected {{on top of a}} coke oven; dust storm particles collected during dust storm periods; and roadside PM 10 collected on a major road in Beijing. Monitoring results reveal that, in the urban area, particle mass levels were higher in winter than in other seasons. The 1 -week/month average PM 10 mass levels were over 250 ?gm? 3 in winter. The particle mass levels in the satellite city were slightly lower than those at the urban site, and the lowest mass levels occurred at the MTR site. The morphology and chemical composition of individual airborne particles were determined by scanning electron microscopy, and image analysis was employed to study the number-size distributions. The number-size distributions of mineral particles showed that those in the Asia-Dust storm (ADS) collections are mostly coarser than 1 ?m, while mineral particles of the non-ADS collections are predominately finer than 1 ?m. The particles in the respirable (< 2. 5 ?m) fraction accounted for 99 % of the total particles in airborne PM samples. Soot aggregates were generally the most abundant components in airborne PM samples at all three sites. The fly ash (spherical) particles at the MTR site were significantly enriched over the heating period, indicating a domestic coal-burning source...|$|E
40|$|The first Air Chemistry Observatory at the German Antarctic station Georg von Neumayer (GvN) was {{operated}} for 10 {{years from}} 1982 to 1991. The {{focus of the}} established observational programme was on characterizing the physical properties and chemical composition of the aerosol, {{as well as on}} monitoring the changing trace gas composition of the background atmosphere, especially concerning greenhouse gases. The observatory was designed by the Institut für Umweltphysik, University of Heidelberg (UHEIIUP). The experiments were installed inside the bivouac lodge, mounted on a sledge and put upon a snow hill to prevent snow accumulation during blizzards. All experiments were under daily control and daily performance protocols were documented. A ventilated stainless steel inlet stack (total height about 3 - 4 m above the snow surface) with a 50 % aerodynamic cut-off diameter around 7 - 10 µm at wind velocities between 4 - 10 m/s supplied all experiments with ambient air. Contamination free sampling was realized by several means: (i) The Air Chemistry Observatory was situated in a <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> <b>area</b> about 1500 m south of GvN. Due to the fact that northern wind directions are very rare, contamination from the base can be excluded for most of the time. (ii) The power supply (20 kW) is provided by a cable from the main station, thus no fuel-driven generator is operated in the very vicinity. (iii) Contamination-free sampling is controlled by the permanently recorded wind velocity, wind direction and by condensation particle concentration. Contamination was indicated if one of the following criteria were given: Wind direction within a 330 °- 30 ° sector, wind velocity 17. 5 m/s, or condensation particle concentrations > 2500 /cm** 3 during summer, > 800 /cm** 3 during spring/autumn and > 400 /cm** 3 during winter. If one or a definable combination of these criteria were given, high volume aerosol sampling and part of the trace gas sampling were interrupted. Starting at 1982 through 1991 - 01 - 14 surface ozone was measured with an electrochemical concentration cell (ECC). Surface ozone mixing ratio are given in ppbv = parts per 10 ** 9 by volume. The averaging time corresponds to the given time intervals in the data sheet. The accuracy of the values are better than ± 1 ppbv and the detection limit is around 1. 0 ppbv. Aerosols were sampled on two Whatman 541 cellulose filters in series and analyzed by ion chromatography at the UHEI-IUP. Generally, the sampling period was seven days but could be up to two weeks on occasion. The air flow was around 100 m** 3 /h and typically 10000 - 20000 m** 3 of ambient air was forced through the filters for one sample. Concentration values are given in nanogram (ng) per 1 m** 3 air at standard pressure and temperature (1013 mbar, 273. 16 K). Uncertainties of the values were approximately ± 10 % to ± 15 % for the main components MSA, chloride, nitrate, sulfate and sodium, and between ± 20 % and ± 30 % for the minor species bromide, ammonium, potassium, magnesium and calcium...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically test the effect that {{restrictive}} <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> laws have on the level of smoking. Restrictive <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> laws refers to the laws which prohibit smoking in private workplaces as well as in public places. The data employed in this study consist of a time series of cross sections of the fifty states of the U. S., and Washington D. C., over the time period from 1975 through 1985, Since states where sentiment is strongly against cigarettes are more likely to pass a <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> law, endogeneity between cigarette demand and the <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> law is a problem. A two step estimation model is used to control for endogeneity. Both a single equation and a two equation model of cigarette demand were estimated. The single equation results indicate that a <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> law has a significant negative effect on cigarette demand. However, the two equation model indicates that cigarette demand has a significant negative effect on the probability of passing a <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> law. The results indicate that when endogeneity is controlled for the <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> law dose not have a significant effect on cigarette demand. This does not imply that the enactment of a <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> law would not reduce the level of smoking if such a law were imposed in all states, but rather that only states with low levels of smoking are able to pass restrictive clean sir laws. ...|$|R
