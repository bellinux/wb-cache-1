5|$|The Admiralty {{initially}} {{specified that}} the ship should be capable of , and have {{a full set of}} sails for worldwide <b>cruising</b> <b>range.</b> Iron construction was chosen as it gave the best trade-off between speed and protection; an iron hull was lighter than a wooden one of the same size and shape, giving more capacity for guns, armour and engines.|$|E
5|$|Steam {{ships of}} the period, which burned coal to fire their boilers, were {{naturally}} tied to coaling stations in friendly ports. The German Navy lacked sufficient overseas bases for sustained operations, even for single ships operating as commerce raiders. The Navy experimented with {{a device to}} transfer coal from colliers to warships while underway in 1907, though the practice was not put into general use. Nevertheless, German capital ships had a <b>cruising</b> <b>range</b> of at least , {{more than enough to}} operate in the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The last pair of {{protected}} cruisers {{built by the}} Italian Navy was intended for colonial service, and were based on experience from Calabria. They were given a relatively heavy main battery for their small size and a long <b>cruising</b> <b>range,</b> {{at the expense of}} armor protection and speed. The ships were so small that they could be built on the same slipway and launched the same day. Since they had been launched less than a week before hostilities broke {{out at the end of}} July 1914, fitting-out work was delayed by a steel shortage, particularly after Italy entered the war. Campania and Basilicata initially served in Libya; neither had eventful careers. The latter vessel was destroyed by a boiler explosion in Tewfik on 13 August 1919. Campania was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921 and became a training ship in 1932. She ultimately was sold for scrap in 1937.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{variable}} sweep wing technology with relaxed static stability requirements on a supersonic-cruise executive jet with transatlantic range was assessed. The baseline vehicle utilized modified, current-technology engines and titanium structures produced with superplastic forming and diffusion bonding; this vehicle meets study requirements for both supersonic-cruise and low-speed characteristics. The baseline concept has a ramp weight of 64, 500 pounds {{with a crew}} of two and eight passengers. Its Mach 2. 0 <b>cruise</b> <b>range</b> is nearly 3, 500 nautical miles; its Mach 0. 9 <b>cruise</b> <b>range</b> is over 5, 000 nautical miles. Takeoff, landing, and balanced field length requirements were calculated for a composite variant and are all less than 5, 000 feet...|$|R
50|$|During 1951, San Pablo {{conducted}} oceanographic studies during various <b>cruises,</b> <b>ranging</b> from Scotland to the Mediterranean Sea {{and along}} the New England coast in the Narragansett Bay area. Her tasks included making accurate profile studies of the ocean bottom {{for the purpose of}} evaluating new sonar devices.|$|R
25|$|Priority for {{a planned}} new frigate (either a T21 or Dutch Kortanear) and {{modernisation}} of HMNZS Taranaki, projects later cancelled by the Muldooon Government, meant F421 received only a 12 month refit in 1980, to maximise seatime of the RNZNs newest warship, and its mid life refit was delayed to Nov 1987 to June 1990, {{at a cost}} of $73 million , the most significant changes fitting of Dutch LW08 long range surveillance radar, Phoenix electronic warfare systems and general replacement of radar and sonar with new solid state systems in place of the original obsolescent, British equipment. Updating was similar but more limited to that carried out of HMNZS Wellington, as F421 did not receive the extra fuel tanks and greatly increased <b>cruising</b> <b>range</b> of Wellington.|$|E
25|$|During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, F-104C Starfighters of the 479th Tactical Fighter Wing from George AFB, California, were {{deployed}} to Eglin {{as part of}} the immense build up of military strength and material in the State of Florida in preparation for possible military action. The 4135th Strategic Wing, Strategic Air Command, Alert crews at Eglin were placed on airborne alert priority with two Eglin B-52s on 24-hour flights within <b>cruising</b> <b>range</b> of Russia. Flights of 24 hours, more than double the usual ten-hour missions, were refueled by KC-135 tankers. Following the end of the crisis, the SAC crews returned to their usual routines. Ready Force, A Company, of the 82d Airborne Division, U.S. Army, was deployed to Eglin from Fort Benning, Georgia, for a possible jump into Havana to seize the airport.|$|E
25|$|In putting {{together}} the curriculum for training pilots and copilots on the B-29 Superfortress, Training Command could make use of its experience in transition training for heavy bombers. No such experience was available {{in the case of}} flight engineers, because the B-29 was the first AAF aircraft that required a flight engineer. This individual operated the engine control panel of the aircraft. Located behind the pilot, the panel contained all operating instruments but those the pilot used to control the altitude and direction of the B-29. At the direction of the pilot, the flight engineer used these instruments to adjust the throttles, fuel mixture, supercharger, and propeller pitch. He also computed the aircraft's <b>cruising</b> <b>range,</b> fuel consumption, engine performance, weight and balance, and airworthiness. Flight engineers underwent comprehensive training at Amarillo and Lowry Fields before assignment to B-29 transition training.|$|E

50|$|Delta Queen cruised the Mississippi River and {{its tributaries}} on a regular schedule, with <b>cruises</b> <b>ranging</b> from New Orleans to Memphis to St. Louis to St. Paul to Cincinnati to Pittsburgh, and many more. In some cruises, the vessel probed rivers such as the Arkansas, Red, Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, Black Warrior, Mobile, and more.|$|R
50|$|The River City Star's {{cruising}} season usually {{begins on}} April 1 and ends on October 31, with its cruising schedule peaking {{for the summer}} months. The boat regularly schedules public and private <b>cruises</b> <b>ranging</b> from one-and-a-half to four hours in duration, {{and it is not}} uncommon for the boat to cruise three or four times in one day.|$|R
25|$|The 10,000-ton treaty cruisers {{were the}} first type of {{warships}} built to internationally agreed restrictions. These restrictions posed new engineering challenges and forced compromises upon designers in how to extract the best balance of speed, armament and protection. The United States Navy adopted a design with triple-gun turrets, allowing the hull to be shortened thus saving weight that could be put into protection. This approach, however, was {{at the expense of}} requiring increased installed power, as the speed of a ship {{is a function of the}} ratio of length to beam. The Royal Navy had a requirement for a vessel for colonial trade route defence, which required a good <b>cruising</b> <b>range</b> and speed and independent fighting power. This determined the need for a long hull and the use of four twin-gun turrets, with any remaining displacement invested in protection.|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} of Law Number 16/2012 allowed Pindad {{to create the}} Komodo to their advantage, in which the law stipulates Indonesia to have local content used in the manufacturing of its defense products with international cooperation. The Komodo was designed in Pindad's Bandung, West Java manufacturing facility with a price tag of about USD$300,000. According to Pindad, the Komodo's monocoque armored body is bulletproof and it can withstand 7.62mm or lower caliber rifle and handgun bullets. The Komodo's glass is also made bulletproof. The Komodo's turbo intercooler diesel engine has a total horsepower of 215 PS at 2500 rpm, allowing the vehicle to achieve the weight ratio of around 30hp/ton. The Komodo can carry up to 200liters of diesel fuel. The vehicle only has a manual transmission system, which consists of 6 forward and 1 reverse gear, allowing the Komodo to have off-road capabilities. President Avianto said that the normal <b>cruising</b> <b>range</b> of the Komodo is at 450kilometers, with an average speed of 70km/h. The Komodo's off-road capabilities have been tested in various conditions ranging from mountainous terrain to mud and sand.|$|E
25|$|The 2S6 combat vehicle {{uses the}} GM-352 and later GM-352M chassis {{developed}} and {{produced by the}} Minsk Tractor Plant (MTZ) which has six road wheels with hydropneumatic suspension on each side, a drive sprocket at the rear and three return rollers. An NBC system is also integrated into the chassis, which is protected -as the entire vehicle- from small arms fire (7,62) and shell splinters by the armor, {{as well as an}} automatic fire suppression system, an automatic gear change and diagnostic capability are available with latest Tunguska-M1 which uses the new GM-5975 chassis developed and produced by MMZ. GM-5975.25 has a <b>cruising</b> <b>range</b> of 500km and a maximum speed of 65km per hour. It can function at a relative humidity of 98 per cent at 35 degrees C, in ambient temperatures of −50 degrees C to 50 degrees C and up to an altitude of 3,000 m. It has an ability of climb up to 35 degrees, can cross slopes of 25 degrees, 2 m width ditch, 1 m depth ford. Overall, the layout is similar to the previous ZSU-23-4 with a large central 360-degree rotating turret (designated the 2A40) containing the armament, sensors and three of the crew: the commander, gunner and radar operator. The driver sits in the front left of the hull, with a gas turbine APU to his right and the multi-fuel diesel engine {{in the rear of the}} hull.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increased}} {{wing aspect ratio}} of subsonic aircraft on configurations with and without strut bracing. Results indicate that an optimum cantilever configuration, with a wing aspect ratio of approximately 26, has a 19 % improvement in <b>cruise</b> <b>range</b> when compared to a baseline concept with a wing aspect ratio of approximately 10. An optimum strut braced configuration, with a wing aspect ratio of approximately 28, has a 31 % improvment in <b>cruise</b> <b>range</b> {{when compared to the}} same baseline concept. This improvement is mainly due to the estimated reduction in wing weight resulting from use of lifting struts. All configurations assume the same mission payload and fuel. The drag characteristics of the wings are enhanced with the use of laminar flow airfoils. A method for determining the extent of attainable natural laminar flow, and methods for preliminary structural design and for aerodynamic analysis of wings lifting struts are presented...|$|R
50|$|Redesignated CC-1 on 15 April 1961, Northampton {{remained}} in the western Atlantic until decommissioning in February 1970. Her <b>cruises</b> <b>ranged</b> from Canadian to Panamanian waters as she extensively tested and evaluated new communications equipment and played host to visiting national and international dignitaries, including Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. The ship was eventually withdrawn from service, and was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 December 1977.|$|R
50|$|Today, most {{traffic on}} the river is recreational. Small private boats are used for water skiing and fishing. Houseboats are common, both {{commercial}} for hire and privately owned.

In 2009, British Adventurer David Cornthwaite walked and kayaked 2476 km along the Murray River from source to sea.|$|R
25|$|Explorer was {{designed}} to be virtually fireproof and collision-proof. Of the materials used to construct her, 99.5 percent were fireproof, and Johns-Manville asbestos Flexboard paneling covered all of her interior spaces. She was built of heavy steel, and her hull plating and internal subdivision was almost twice that required for a ship of her class, greatly reducing her vulnerability to flooding {{in the event of a}} collision. Eight transverse bulkheads extending up to the main deck divided her into nine watertight compartments, and she {{was designed}} to withstand the flooding of two of the compartments without sinking; only three of the bulkheads were pierced by openings, and these could be sealed by closing electrically driven watertight doors operated from the bridge. To protect her hull from penetration by ice or rocks, Explorer had a double bottom and a 0.5-inch (12.7-mm) steel belt plate along her sides that extended six feet (1.8 meters) above and below the waterline. She was designed for six-month independent deployments, with the capability to service smaller vessels and shore stations. Explorer was equipped with a hospital, machine shop, electrical shop, carpenter shop, laundry, and marine garage. The accommodation for her crew and other embarked personnel were considered especially comfortable for the era. She could carry 99 tons of boiler water, 75 tons of drinking and cooking water, and 325 tons of fuel, giving her a <b>cruising</b> <b>range</b> of 7,000 nautical miles (8,056 statute miles; 12,964km) at a speed of 12 knots (13.8mph; 22.2km/hr).|$|E
