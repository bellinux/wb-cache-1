40|$|In {{designing}} the pressure vessel equipment, the <b>nozzle</b> <b>connection</b> requires a careful study of many regions. One {{of the critical}} aspects in designing pressure vessels is the <b>nozzle</b> <b>connections</b> in the ellipsoidal head of two intersecting shells. Two {{of the most important}} design guide (codes and standards) for {{designing the}} pressure vessel are ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) pressure vessel code and WRC (Welding Research Council) bulletins. Both ASME and WRC standards do not directly address procedures or provide acceptance criteria for the effect of external forces and moments imposed by a piping system to the nozzle, and do not deal with ellipsoidal heads. Therefore, a parametric study was carried out in this research. The aim is to understand the behavior of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>connections</b> in radial and non-radial orientation to ellipsoidal head vessel subjected to the internal pressure and various external loading using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method. All the results analysis for both radial and non-radial nozzle are presented as graphs of non-dimensional parameters against stress concentration factor (SCF) for each load case applied. For validation, an analytical investigation using thin shell theory was utilized for the radial nozzle due to applied internal pressure loading.

40|$|In this study, two power {{supplies}} having positive/ground and negative/ground electrode output ends were used separately for electrospinning of polyacrylonitrile nanofibers. Depending on type of power supply and electrode connection, electrospinning led to different fiber diameters and deposition areas. The nozzle {{was connected to}} a high voltage end while the collector was grounded. Regardless of power supply used, finer fibers with a larger deposition area were obtained, compared to that using the same setup but with a reverse electrode connection. With {{an increase in the}} applied voltage, fiber deposition area, and productivity increased for all electrode <b>connections.</b> Grounded <b>nozzles</b> provide much better control over fiber deposition than the reverse electrode connections. Finite element modeling was used to analyze the electric field profile in the electrospinning zone. It was revealed that high electric intensity was mainly located in the part that was charged with a high voltage electrode, which could explain the differences in fiber diameter and deposition area. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Standard piping {{analysis}} programs, {{used to determine}} the deflections and stresses in piping systems, are often employed under conditions that are not within the scope of assumptions in the formulation of the programs. Such a case is the analysis of closely interconnected heat exchangers, pressure vessels and other such equipment. The major problem when using a {{piping analysis}} program is that the <b>nozzle</b> <b>connections</b> are modeled infinitely rigid rather than as an element with a finite flexibility. The results generated by such misapplication of the programs is usually (but not always) very conservative. This paper will demonstrate a hybrid method which employs conventional piping analysis software, WRC- 107, WRC- 297 and Finite Element (FE) software to attempt to obtain a better estimate of the deflections, forces, moments, and stresses.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} the further investigation of the shell intersection problem. The pad reinforced <b>nozzle</b> <b>connections</b> of the cylindrical vessel under internal and external loads are investigated using elastic–plastic analysis and the stress analysis in intersecting shells (SAIS) special-purpose computer program. The method for determin-ing the plastic limit load based on the maximum criterion of the rate of the change of the relative plastic work and program module LOAD_PL for its realization are presented. The results of comparisons with the twice elastic-slope (TES) method were considered for determining the plastic limit load using known experimental data for models of a pad reinforced cylindrical vessel with a radial nozzle under a transverse force. The results of a parametric study of unreinforced and pad reinforced vessel models with a nozzle under internal pressure, in-plane moment, and out-plane moment loadings are discussed.

40|$|When the {{material}} yields local {{stress and strain}} behaviour changes, especially {{if there is a}} notch, determination of the local strain value can be difficult. Therefore {{it is not easy to}} predict the life of mechanical components in the low-cycle region. In the present work pressure vessels are considered and fatigue tests carried out. The most stressed zones, which are at the <b>connections</b> between the <b>nozzles</b> and the vessel, are subjected to cyclic loads with subsequent repeated plastic strains that cause nucleation and propagation of fatigue cracks. The life of such a mechanical component under low cycle fatigue can be predicted by utilizing the life strain curves ε-Nf or the energy approach (plastic strain and total strain energy density). In the present work, life prediction is performed by considering several different approaches. The results are compared with the experimental results obtained by fatigue testing pressure vessel nozzles. The material considered is Fe 510 B UNI 7070 - 72 steel...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the use of 3 M Corporation's Bair Hugger® forced air warming (FAW) device and the {{transfer}} of potentially infectious material to the patient's skin. Methods: After receiving approval from 2 IRBs, 31 patients undergoing surgical procedures that would benefit from active warming were consented for this study. Per the study protocol, 3 samples were obtained from each subject using contact agar plate sampling. After cleansing the skin and preparing it as for a surgical incision" the first sample was taken directly underneath the <b>nozzle</b> <b>connection</b> for the FAW prior to blanket application. At the termination of the procedure a second sample was taken from the same area and the third sample was taken from the interior of the blanket prior to removing it from the patient. The agar plates were incubated for 48 hours and the plates were inspected for any growth. All plates were examined for any colony forming units (CFUs). The numbers of CFUs were counted for comparison between all 3 samples. Results: Of the 30 patients included in the study, three (10 %) had contamination of the skin following removal of the FAW blanket, and the remaining 27 (90 %) had no skin contamination. Colony growth was present on the interior of 14 (47 %) of the FAW blankets postoperatively. No patient had any postoperative surgical site infections after a 30 day follow up. Conclusion: This study concluded that despite the potential for contamination of the patient's skin the risk of warming each patient with a FAW may outweigh the risks associated with hypothermia...|$|R
40|$|The Integrated Health Management (IHM) for {{the future}} {{aerospace}} systems requires to interface models of multiple subsystems in an efficient and accurate information environment at the earlier stages of system design. The complexity of modern aeronautic and aircraft systems (including e. g. the power distribution, flight control, solid and liquid motors) dictates employment of hybrid models and high-level reasoners for analysing mixed continuous and discrete information flow involving multiple modes of operation in uncertain environments, unknown state variables, heterogeneous software and hardware components. To provide the information link between key design/performance parameters and high-level reasoners we rely on development of multi-physics performance models, distributed sensors networks, and fault diagnostic and prognostic (FD&P) technologies in close collaboration with system designers. The main challenges of our research {{are related to the}} in-flight assessment of the structural stability, engine performance, and trajectory control. The main goal is to develop an intelligent IHM that not only enhances components and system reliability, but also provides a post-flight feedback helping to optimize design of the next generation of aerospace systems. Our efforts are concentrated on several directions of the research. One of the key components of our strategy is an innovative approach to the diagnostics/prognostics based on the real time dynamical inference (DI) technologies extended to encompass hybrid systems with hidden state trajectories. The major investments are into the multiphysics performance modelling that provides an access of the FD&P technologies to the main performance parameters of e. g. solid and liquid rocket motors and composite materials of the nozzle and case. Some of the recent results of our research are discussed in this chapter. We begin by introducing the problem of dynamical inference of stochastic nonlinear models and reviewing earlier results. Next, we present our analytical approach to the solution of this problem based on the path integral formulation. The resulting algorithm does not require an extensive global search for the model parameters, provides optimal compensation for the effects of dynamical noise, and is robust for a broad range of dynamical models. In the following Section the strengths of the algorithm are illustrated illustrated by inferring the parameters of the stochastic Lorenz system and comparing the results with those of earlier research. Next, we discuss a number of recent results in application {{to the development of the}} IHM for aerospace system. Firstly, we apply dynamical inference approach to a solution of classical three tank problems with mixed unknown continuous and binary parameters. The problem is considered in the context of ground support system for filling fuel tanks of liquid rocket motors. It is shown that the DI algorithm is well suited for successful solution of a hybrid version of this benchmark problem even in the presence of additional periodic and stochastic perturbation of unknown strength. Secondly, we illustrate our approach by its application to an analysis of the nozzle fault in a solid rocket motor (SRM). The internal ballistics of the SRM is modelled as a set of one-dimensional partial differential equations coupled to the dynamics of the propellant regression. In this example we are specifically focussed on the inference of discrete and continuous parameters of the nozzle blocking fault and on the possibility of an application of the DI algorithm to reducing the probability of "misses" of an on-board FD&P for SRM. In the next section re-contact problem caused by first stage/upper stage separation failure is discussed. The reaction forces imposed on the nozzle of the upper stage during the re-contact and their <b>connection</b> to the <b>nozzle</b> damage and to the thrust vector control (TVC) signal are obtained. It is shown that transient impact induced torquean be modelled as a response of an effective damped oscillator. A possible application of the DI algorithm to the inference of damage parameters and predicting fault dynamics ahead of time using the actuator signal is discussed. Finally, we formulate Bayesian inferential framework for development of the IHM system for in-flight structural health monitoring (SHM) of composite materials. We consider the signal generated by piezoelectric actuator mounted on composite structure generating elastic waves in it. The signal received by the sensor is than compared with the baseline signal. The possibility of damage inference is discussed in the context of development of the SHM...|$|R
