5|$|An equally {{important}} reform was {{the abolition of}} private tax farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private <b>contractors</b> <b>who</b> collected taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era. Some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome. These tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations, great private wealth, {{and the right to}} tax local areas.|$|E
5|$|The poor {{conditions}} at the penitentiary were partially because the state leased management of the facility to private <b>contractors,</b> <b>who</b> frequently neglected prisoners' needs to cut costs. These contractors often provided benefits such as cheap laundry services and free meals to legislators to secure contracts {{and encourage them to}} ignore their abuse of prisoners. Blackburn called for the contract system to be replaced with a system of oversight by wardens employed by the state.|$|E

5|$|At the Princess, sound {{installation}} {{was completed}} by August 16. An entire page of the Edmonton Bulletin was devoted to the reopening, including a congratulating ad from a local record store, an ad for the electrical <b>contractors</b> <b>who</b> installed the wiring, and a message congratulating the Princess placed by the managers of three other establishments already wired for sound: the Rialto, Empress and Capitol Theatres. The physical renovations necessary to accommodate the new wiring were carried out by S. H. Muttart, an important local builder and namesake of the Muttart Conservatory in Edmonton’s River Valley. The first talkie screened at the Princess was Close Harmony starring Buddy Rogers and Nancy Carroll.|$|E
5|$|Due to Maxine's father's illness, Jennings had to shuttle between Arizona and Texas. While {{his family}} lived back in Littlefield, Jennings {{found a job}} briefly at KOYL in Odessa, Texas. He moved {{with his family to}} Coolidge, Arizona, where his wife's sister lived. He found a job {{performing}} at the Galloping Goose bar, where he was heard by Earl Perrin, who offered him a spot on KCKY. Jennings also played during the intermission at drive-in theaters and in bars. After a successful performance at the Cross Keys Club in Phoenix, he was approached by <b>contractors</b> <b>who</b> were building a club for Jimmy D. Musiel, called JD's. Musiel employed Jennings as his main artist and designed the club around his act.|$|E
5|$|De Gomme {{prepared}} several {{plans for}} the King in 1665; a further iteration of the designs was submitted in 1670 and given royal approval. Work began the same year but it took until 1685 to complete the project. The work {{was carried out by}} skilled <b>contractors,</b> <b>who</b> were supplemented by large teams of pressed men brought in from across the region; during 1671, up to 256 workers were employed on the site. Around 3,000 timber piles had to be brought from Norway for the project in 1671 to support the foundations in the marshy ground. The resources needed for the King's multiple defence projects became stretched, and one of the planned bastions at Tilbury, originally planned to face the river, was cancelled in 1681, in part to save money. The total cost of the project is unknown, but was significantly more than the original estimate of £47,000.|$|E

5|$|Farm incomes {{have fallen}} {{over the years}} as a result of cheap food {{policies}} in the United Kingdom, the lowering of world commodity prices and the removal of production-based subsidies. Particularly hard hit have been the incomes of hill farms in Wales which averaged £15,000 in 2014, as against £23,000 for lowland livestock farms and £59,000 for dairy farms. The labour force has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and changes in farming practices. Fewer farmers are needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land. Hay is no longer the main source of winter feed for livestock and has largely been replaced by silage, particularly baled silage wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically. This has reduced the manpower needed on farms, and there has been an increase of use by farmers of specialised <b>contractors</b> <b>who</b> provide services in silage making, harvesting and fencing. Another problem facing Welsh farmers is their distance from the main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in England.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the Fleur-de-Lys Administrative Committee and the Birkirkara Local Council {{announced}} that they were planning to rebuild the arch to the same dimensions of the original. The police force had initially objected to the project, believing {{it could become a}} traffic hazard, but of similar risk comparisons to other monumental arches and gates in Malta, such as the Portes de Bombes. The plans were eventually approved by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority in October of the same year, but they were placed on hold since a tender appeal had to be sorted out. In April 2013, the tender was awarded to Vaults Ltd instead of V <b>Contractors</b> <b>who</b> had originally won the tender. The replica arch cost €280,000 to build, and €100,000 of these were donated by the Bank of Valletta. €40,000 were taken from the Good Causes Fund, while the remaining €140,000 were paid by the Birkirkara Local Council.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May 1889 a {{demonstration}} train comprising two carriages and two locomotives {{ran along the}} newly completed line from Chesham to Rickmansworth, carrying the subscribers who had funded the extension {{and representatives of the}} local authorities and School Boards covering the areas through which the new line ran. (As no Metropolitan Railway train had yet run through to Chesham on the finished line, the train from Chesham to Rickmansworth was drawn by two locomotives belonging to the <b>contractors</b> <b>who</b> had built the line, rather than by MR engines. A third engine ran ahead of the demonstration train to act as a pilot.) A second train carried the directors of the Metropolitan Railway from London to Rickmansworth, collected those passengers who had ridden the demonstration train from Chesham to Rickmansworth, and continued to Chesham.|$|E

5|$|The German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) ordered Westfalen {{under the}} {{provisional}} name Ersatz Sachsen {{as a replacement}} for , the lead ship of the elderly s. The Reichstag secretly approved and provided funds for Nassau and Westfalen at the end of March 1906, but construction on Westfalen was delayed while arms and armor were procured. She was laid down on 12 August 1907 at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen. As with her sister , construction proceeded swiftly and secretly; detachments of soldiers guarded both the shipyard and the major <b>contractors</b> <b>who</b> supplied building materials, such as Krupp. The ship was launched on 1 July 1908, underwent an initial fitting-out, and then in mid-September 1909 was transferred to Kiel by a crew composed of dockyard workers for a final fitting-out. However, the water level in the Weser River was low at this time of year, so six pontoons had to be attached to the ship to reduce her draft. Even so, it took two attempts before the ship cleared the river.|$|E
