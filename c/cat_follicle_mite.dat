50|$|The Sandwalk Adventures is {{a graphic}} novel created by Assistant Professor of Biology at Juniata College, Jay Hosler. It was {{originally}} published in 2001 as five comic books, and republished as into a single graphic novel in 2003. The Sandwalk Adventures is the tale of <b>follicle</b> <b>mites</b> living in the left eyebrow of Charles Darwin himself. The mites believe Darwin to be a god, one of their creation myths handed down from generation to generation, {{and he has to}} set them straight about that and other mite fables. A humorous series of illustrated lessons in natural selection and evolution ensues.|$|R
5000|$|Demodex bovis, {{also known}} as the cattle <b>follicle</b> <b>mite,</b> usually causes demodicosis, or demodectic mange, in cattle. This disease is common in {{tropical}} areas and is not usually found in temperate environments. [...] Demodicosis is characterized by the formation of papules and nodules over the cattle's skin. These lesions most commonly occur on the neck, shoulders, and armpit of cattle; however, sometimes they also appear on the udder. This condition is often found in cattle with increased stress from pregnancy or lactation. Natural and acquired immunity can cause a {{decrease in the number of}} mites infesting a cow as well as decreasing the severity of a cow's symptoms.|$|R
25|$|Demodicosis, {{also known}} as demodectic mange, is caused by Demodex canis mites which live in small numbers in sebaceous glands and hair <b>follicles.</b> These <b>mites</b> can cause {{inflammation}} and hair loss, and may also lead to secondary bacterial infections such as fever, lethargy, and enlarged lymph nodes.|$|R
50|$|Jay Hosler is {{the author}} and {{illustrator}} of science-oriented comics. He {{is best known for}} his graphic novels Clan Apis, The Sandwalk Adventures, and Optical Allusions. Clan Apis, a Xeric Foundation Award winner, follows the life of a honey bee named Nyuki; the story conveys factual information about honey bees in a humorous fashion as Nyuki learns about each new stage of her life. The Sandwalk Adventures, an Eisner Award nominee, follows a conversation about evolution between Charles Darwin and a <b>follicle</b> <b>mite</b> living in his left eyebrow. Optical Allusions, funded in part by a National Science Foundation grant, explains the evolution of the eye and vision by following the story of Wrinkles the Wonderbrain. Hosler is also an entomologist and associate professor of biology at Juniata College.|$|R
40|$|Summary We {{present a}} 35 -year-old patient with {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome who had demodici-dosis on his face, characterized by multiple papules and papulopustules, associated pruritus, numerous mites on skin-surface biopsy and in biopsy specimens, and rapid response to topical treatment with permethrin. It seems likely that Demodex infestation does not manifest unless local or systemic immune function is altered, leading to the proliferation of the organism and subsequent disease. Key words: {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}}, Demodex folliculitis, Demodex mites, demodici-dosis, rosacea-like dermatosis The hair <b>follicle</b> <b>mites</b> Demodex folliculorum and D. brevis are common inhabitants of the human pilosebaceous unit. 1 D. folliculorum is more common than D. brevis and {{is characterized by a}} larger size, an elongated posterior segment, and arrowhead-shaped eggs. It is usually located in the follicular infundibulum and may be present in numbers up to 10 ± 15 per follicle. I...|$|R
50|$|The adult mites {{are only}} 0.3 - 0.4 mm long, with D. brevis {{slightly}} shorter than D. folliculorum. Each has a semitransparent, elongated body {{that consists of}} two fused segments. Eight short, segmented legs {{are attached to the}} first body segment. The body is covered with scales for anchoring itself in the hair <b>follicle,</b> and the <b>mite</b> has pin-like mouthparts for eating skin cells and oils (sebum) which accumulate in the hair <b>follicles.</b> The <b>mites</b> can leave the hair follicles and slowly walk around on the skin, at a speed of 8 - 16 cm per hour, especially at night, as they try to avoid light. The mites are transferred between hosts through contact with hair, eyebrows, and the sebaceous glands of the face.|$|R
40|$|Glycoconjugate {{modifications}} were analysed in the zona pellucida during {{development of}} oocytes in dog and cat using conventional histochemical staining methods {{with or without}} previous carbohydrate digestion. A series of lectins combined with desulphation and sialic acid degradation were applied. No differences were observed between dog and <b>cat</b> <b>follicles</b> using conventional histochemical staining methods. In both species, the zona pellucida and follicular fluid/intercellular matrix strongly reacted with PAS and high iron diamine stain (HID) and reacted moderately with low iron diamine stain (LID). Treatment with testicular hyaluronidase, chondroitinase ABC, chondroitinase AC and chondroitinase B treatment diminished HID and LID positivity of follicular fluid and intercellular matrix. Lectins that gave the most intense staining of the zona pellucida of both species were SBA, PNA, RCA-I, GSA-IB 4 and WGA, indicating the presence of beta-D-GalNAc, D-Gal and GlcNAc residues. Sulpho- and asulpho-carbohydrates were identified in terminal and/or subterminal positions linked to sialic acid residues. In conclusion, {{the results indicate that}} glycosaminoglycans are not present in the zona pellucida of both species. Differences were observed in carbohydrate residues and in their spatial distribution, depending on species and developmental stage of the follicles. The similarity in lectin affinity between ooplasm and zona pellucida of oocytes present in follicles at different stages of development confirm the involvement of oocytes in zona pellucida production...|$|R
5000|$|Demodicosis {{occurs when}} female mites lay eggs in hair {{follicle}}s. Each follicle may contain {{hundreds or thousands}} of mites, which leads to the formation of skin papules and nodules. These papules and nodules, or bumps beneath the skin, can be felt even before they can be seen. [...] Typically, the papules and nodules last for a month and then are replaced with new ones. They typically are found in the greatest numbers during spring and summer months. Their size can range from as small as a pinhead to as large as a chicken egg. The larger ones are formed when the cysts grow in size, forming granulomatous nodules, characterized by the blocking of the opening of the <b>follicle</b> by <b>mites,</b> keratin, and other remnants. These large cysts can burst, which causes open wounds to form. The thick pus-like substance that comes out of these sores contains Demodex bovis, which can be spread to other animals. Another way mites can be spread is when female <b>mites</b> leave the <b>follicle</b> they are in and go lay eggs in a new follicle. This form of transfer can spread the condition to different follicles on an already infected cow as well as to other cows and animals through copulation or other physical contact. For instance, mites may be transmitted to calves within a few days of nursing, when the shoulders and hips of calves contact the infected mother.|$|R
50|$|One genus of mites, Demodex, has {{adapted to}} infesting the hair follicles of its hosts. These mites remain {{external}} to the true outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) which also lines the tube of the hair <b>follicle.</b> However, the <b>mites</b> appear to be deep within the skin {{in the sense of}} being below the general outer surface of the host. The mites fit in the narrow space between the hair and the tube of the follicle. They may also crawl out onto the general epidermal surface of their host. Transmission of these mites from host to host occurs during close contact when young animals are suckled. Demodex mites are morphologically adapted to this constricted habitat: microscopic, worm shaped, and with very short legs. The mites feed on cells of the epidermal lining of the hair follicle. Many species of mammals, including humans, are readily infested with these mites, but typically the density of infestation is very low. However they are considered parasitic in people with weakened immune systems.|$|R
5000|$|The mystacial macrovibrissae {{are shared}} by {{a large group of}} land and marine mammals (see images), and it is this group that has {{received}} by far the most scientific study. The arrangement of these whiskers is not random: they form an ordered grid of arcs (columns) and rows, with shorter whiskers at the front and longer whiskers at the rear (see images). In the mouse, gerbil, hamster, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, and <b>cat,</b> each individual <b>follicle</b> is innervated by 100-200 primary afferent nerve cells. These cells serve an even larger number of mechanoreceptors of at least eight distinct types. Accordingly, even small deflections of the vibrissal hair can evoke a sensory response in the animal. Rats and mice typically have approximately 30 macrovibrissae {{on each side of the}} face, with whisker lengths up to around 50 mm in (laboratory) rats, 30 mm in (laboratory) mice, and a slightly larger number of microvibrissae. [...] Thus, an estimate for the total number of sensory nerve cells serving the mystacial vibrissal array on the face of a rat or mouse might be 25,000.|$|R
40|$|The early {{consequences}} of Helicobacter pylori infection {{and the role}} of bacterial virulence determinants in disease outcome remain to be established. The present study sought to measure the development of host inflammatory and immune responses and their relationship to the putative bacterial virulence factors cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI), vacA allele, and oipA in combination with bacterial colonization density in a feline model of the early stages of H. pylori infection. Gastric tissues obtained from infected and uninfected cats were evaluated for H. pylori ureB, cagPAI, vacA allele, and oipA and colonization density (urease, histology, and real-time PCR). Inflammation was assessed by measuring mRNA upregulation of gamma interferon (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL) - 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10, and IL- 12 p 40 and histopathology. The mucosal immune response was characterized by morphometric analysis of lymphoid follicles and by differentiating lymphocyte populations with antibodies against surface markers. Infecting H. pylori strains were positive for vacAs 1 but lacked cagPAI and an active oipA gene. Colonization density was uniform throughout the stomach. Upregulation of IFN-γ, IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 8 and increased severity of inflammatory infiltrates and fibrosis were observed in infected cats. The median number and total area of lymphoid aggregates were 5 and 10 times greater, respectively, in the stomachs of infected than uninfected <b>cats.</b> Secondary lymphoid <b>follicles</b> in uninfected <b>cats</b> were rare and positive for BLA. 36 and B 220 but negative for CD 3 and CD 79 α, whereas in infected cats they were frequent and positive for BLA. 36, CD 79 α, and CD 3 but negative for B 220. Upregulation of IFN-γ, IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 8 and marked hyperplasia of secondary lymphoid follicles are early {{consequences of}} H. pylori infection in cats. The response appears to be similar to that of infected people, particularly children, can develop independently of the pathogenicity factors cagPAI and oipA, and is not correlated with the degree of colonization density or urease activity...|$|R
40|$|Acne {{is one of}} the commonest skin {{diseases}} that dermatologists have to treat. The diagnosis of acne is usually made from the finding of the following aspects: 1) clinical features: acne vulgaris is characterized by a mixture of non-inflamed (open and closed comedones) and inflamed (papules, pustules, nodules) lesions; 2) topography of acne lesions, which involve face, back and chest; 3) epidemiology of the disease. Although acne may affect persons of all ages, the disease is most prevalent and most severe during adolescence; 4) occurrence of scars. Scarring represents a frequent outcome of acne and can lead to lifelong concern in regarding self-esteem. Even thought the diagnosis of acne is usually readily made, acne may be confused with several diseases, which can have a similar appearance. The following acneiform disorders may represent a differential diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Drug-induced acneiform eruptions are often sudden on onset and are usually more monomorphous in their appearance than acne vulgaris. A history of drug assumption is diriment for diagnosis, while the eruption resolves spontaneously following removal of the offending agent. Rosacea occurs most commonly in adults and is clinically characterized by facial flushing and erythema of the cheeks, nose, forehead and chin. Papules and pustules can develop within the areas of erythema. Scarring does not occur. Rosacea fulminans is an explosive form of rosacea, characterized by monstrous coalescent inflammatory lesions. Comedones are notably absent. The disease resolves with no or minimal scarring. In perioral dermatitis, erythema, scaling and small papules and pustules typically occur around the mouth and on the chin. Gram-negative folliculitis is characterized by the sudden development of superficial pustules in patients who have been treated for acne with antibiotics, which are ineffective in the long run. Bacteriology reveals a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria. Follicular pyodermas may mimic acne, especially when an acne-like distribution pattern is observed. However, the absence of comedones may suggest the proper diagnosis. Demodecidosis is a persistent disease of facial <b>follicles</b> due to <b>mites</b> of the species Demodex folliculorum and Demodex species. Comedones and scars are lacking and most of patients are 50 - 70 years of age. Diagnosis rests on demonstration of large numbers of mites. These represent only some of the skin disorders which may be misdiagnosed as acne vulgaris. An accurate evaluation of the clinical and history clues of acne is essential in properly diagnose and treat the disease...|$|R
