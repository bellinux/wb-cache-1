40|$|Abstract Background: To {{evaluate}} the antibacterial activity of 21 plant essential oils against six bacterial species. Methods: The selected essential oils were screened against four gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris) and two gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus at four different concentrations (1 : 1, 1 : 5, 1 : 10 and 1 : 20) using disc diffusion method. The MIC {{of the active}} essential oils were tested using two fold agar dilution method at concentrations ranging from 0. 2 to 25. 6 mg/ml. Results: Out of 21 essential oils tested, 19 oils showed antibacterial activity against one or more strains. Cinnamon, clove, geranium, lemon, lime, orange and rosemary oils exhibited significant inhibitory effect. Cinnamon oil showed promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, whereas aniseed, eucalyptus and <b>camphor</b> <b>oils</b> were least active against the tested bacteria. In general, B. subtilis was the most susceptible. On the other hand, K. pneumoniae exhibited low degree of sensitivity. Conclusion: Majority of the oils showed antibacterial activity against the tested strains. However Cinnamon, clove and lime oils {{were found to be}} inhibiting both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Cinnamon oil can be a good source of antibacterial agents. </p...|$|R

It has also been suggested that the complaints are often neurological in nature and may be linked to some kind of nervous dysfunction.There are several ways that a person is believed to be able to prevent Pasma. These include avoiding tiresome, repetitive movements of the upper extremities, showering and bathing in the morning, and avoiding washing clothes after ironing. Folkloric treatments for Pasma include massages using ginger, coconut oil, alcohol, garlic, and <b>camphor</b> <b>oil.</b> Soaking in lukewarm salted water or rice water is believed to cure Pasma, as well is Pasmang-bituka, a daily salted decoctions of solasi (Holy basil).|$|E
50|$|Safrole (4-allyl-1,2-methylenedioxybenzene or shikimol) is a phenylpropene. It is a {{colourless}} {{or slightly}} yellow oily liquid which is typically {{extracted from the}} root-bark or the fruit of Sassafras albidum (native to eastern north America) {{in the form of}} sassafras oil, or from Ocotea odorifera, a Brazilian species. It can also be synthesized from catechol or other related methylenedioxy compounds. Safrole is also present in certain essentials oils and in brown <b>camphor</b> <b>oil,</b> which is in small amounts present in many plants and functions as a natural pesticide. Safrole {{is a member of the}} methylenedioxybenzene group, of which many compounds are used as insecticide synergists; for example, safrole is used as a precursor in the synthesis of the insecticide piperonyl butoxide. Safrole is also used as a precursor in the synthesis of the drug N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy). Safrole can be found in anise, nutmeg, cinnamon, and black pepper, and as an additive in root beer, chewing gum, toothpaste, soaps, and certain pharmaceutical preparations. Before safrole was banned by the FDA in 1960 for use in food, it was used as a food flavour for its characteristic ‘candy-shop’ aroma. Safrole has been shown to exhibit antibiotic and anti-angiogenic functions.|$|E
40|$|Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a {{mycotoxin}} {{which is}} a common contaminant in grains during storage. Aspergillus ochraceus {{is the most common}} producer of OTA. Essential oils play a crucial role as a biocontrol in the reduction of fungal contamination. Essential oils namely natural cinnamaldehyde, cinnamon oil, synthetic cinnamaldehyde, Litsea citrate oil, citral, eugenol, peppermint, eucalyptus, anise and <b>camphor</b> <b>oils,</b> were tested for their efficacy against A. ochraceus growth and OTA production by fumigation and contact assays. Natural cinnamaldehyde proved to be the most effective against A. ochraceus when compared to other oils. Complete fungal growth inhibition was obtained at 150 - 250 µL/L with fumigation and 250 - 500 µL/L with contact assays for cinnamon oil, natural and synthetic cinnamaldehyde, L. citrate oil and citral. Essential oils {{had an impact on the}} ergosterol biosynthesis and OTA production. Complete inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis was observed at ≥ 100 µg/mL of natural cinnamaldehyde and at 200 µg/mL of citral, but total inhibition was not observed at 200 µg/mL of eugenol. But, citral and eugenol could inhibit the OTA production at ≥ 75 µg/mL and ≥ 150 µg/mL respectively, while natural cinnamaldehyde couldn't fully inhibit OTA production at ≤ 200 µg/mL. The inhibition of OTA by natural cinnamaldehyde is mainly due to the reduction in fungal biomass. However, citral and eugenol could significant inhibit the OTA biosynthetic pathway. Also, we observed that cinnamaldehyde was converted to cinnamic alcohol by A. ochraceus, suggesting that the antimicrobial activity of cinnamaldehyde was mainly attributed to its carbonyl aldehyde group. The study concludes that natural cinnamaldehyde, citral and eugenol could be potential biocontrol agents against OTA contamination in storage grains...|$|R

3000|$|Theoretically, {{the mystery}} of carbon growth at {{nanoscale}} is not completely solved [32]. A simple nucleation-growth mechanism of Fe-filled sphere-like GS to almost catalyst-free CNT was carried out to overcome some major experimental stumbling blocks. Our aim is {{to determine how the}} nanotube-like structure was grown from GS surfaces. The nature of <b>camphor</b> <b>oil</b> (C 10 H 16 O) itself is a monoterpene, a molecule that is built up biosynthetically from two isoprene units which obey the isoprene rule, (C 5 H 8) n, where n is the number of linked isoprene units. Interestingly, a previous study on camphor reported by Kareem [33] showed that the decomposition end-product sublimated from solid to volatile material at ordinary room temperature, and ambient air was calculated by fractional life method. Kumar and Ando [34, 35] reported the mass production of CNT which was synthesized from botanical <b>camphor</b> <b>oil</b> rather than conventional hydrocarbon precursors. Unlike any other precursors, <b>camphor</b> <b>oil</b> is a non-toxic, reproducible precursor and is abundantly grown in Asian countries. Hence, the hydrocarbon precursor decomposition study is strongly dependent on environmental conditions [36] as evaluated using suitable analytical tools attached with a mass spectrometer [37] to extract derivative compounds from hydrocarbon precursor. This could explain why it is important to observe the preliminary study of kinetics of hydrocarbon precursor decomposition in selected gas ambient before proceeding to the selection of synthesis time. Bahrami et al. [38] reported and proposed the synthesis and nucleation-growth mechanism of CNT on Fe/MgO catalyst at 900 °C to 1, 000 °C for 1 to 60 min. They found that Fe x O y [...] was coated on MgO surface and reduced in situ in hydrocarbon precursor to Fe nanoparticles. Indirectly, tube-like structure was grown on Fe nanoparticles. This phenomenon can be either tip- or base-growth mechanism of CNT as supported by Charlier et al. [39].|$|E
