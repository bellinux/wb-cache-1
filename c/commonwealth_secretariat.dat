5|$|George William Odlum (24 June 1934 – 28 September 2003) was a Saint Lucian left-wing {{politician}} {{who served as}} Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Born in Castries, Odlum studied at Bristol University and Oxford University in the United Kingdom before returning to Saint Lucia as Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Trade. After working for the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat</b> and the West Indies Associated States, he formed the Saint Lucia Forum, a left-wing pressure group. This group merged with the Saint Lucia Labour Party {{in time for the}} 1974 elections; although the Party did not win, the progress they made allowed them to take power in 1979, with Odlum as Deputy Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the money}} left after Sarah's {{numerous}} bequests was inherited by her grandson, John Spencer, with the condition {{that he could not}} accept a political office under the government. He also inherited the remainder of Sarah's numerous estates, including Wimbledon. Marlborough House remained empty for fourteen years, with the exception of James Stephens, one of her executors, before it became the property of the Dukes of Marlborough upon Stephens's death. In 1817, it became a royal residence, and passed through members of the British royal family until it became the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat</b> in 1959. Wimbledon Park House succumbed to fire in 1785; and Holywell House, Sarah's birthplace in St Albans, was demolished in 1827. Today, much of St Albans is named after the Marlboroughs because of Sarah's influence.|$|E
5|$|Odlum {{was born}} on 24 June 1934 in Castries, {{the son of a}} barber. He studied {{economics}} at Bristol University, becoming the first Afro-Caribbean head of the University of Bristol Union before moving to Magdalen College, Oxford in 1959, where he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics {{and was one of the}} few Afro-Caribbean students to attend. At university, Odlum acted, played both football and cricket, and became noted as a successful debater. After graduating from Oxford he returned to St Lucia in 1961, becoming a Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Trade. He moved back to the United Kingdom in 1964 to work as an economist in the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat,</b> leaving 3 years later. Returning to St Lucia again, he became Executive Secretary to the Council of Ministers of the West Indies Associated States.|$|E

5|$|The {{freehold}} {{of much of}} {{the southern}} side of the Pall Mall is owned by the Crown Estate. In addition to St. James's Palace, Marlborough House, which was once a royal residence, is its neighbour to the east, opening off a courtyard just to the south of the street. It was built for Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough who laid the foundation stone in 1709, with building complete by 1711. The house reverted to Crown ownership in 1817; the future King George V was born here in 1865 and briefly lived in the house as Prince of Wales during the reign of his father, Edward VII. It became government-owned in 1959 and houses now the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat</b> and the Commonwealth Foundation. The Prince Regent's Carlton House was built at the eastern end of Pall Mall in 1732 for Frederick, Prince of Wales and later inhabited by his widow, Princess Augusta. A ball was held at the house on 19 June 1811 to celebrate the start of the Prince's regency, but ultimately he did not decide to stay in the house upon ascending the throne, and it was demolished. John Nash built Carlton House Terrace on its site between 1827–32.|$|E

25|$|The Commonwealth of Nations (formerly the British Commonwealth), {{also known}} as simply the Commonwealth, is an {{intergovernmental}} organisation of 52 member states that are mostly former territories of the British Empire.

25|$|The {{flag of the}} Commonwealth {{consists}} of {{the symbol of the}} <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat,</b> a gold globe surrounded by emanating rays, on a dark blue field; it was designed for the second CHOGM in 1973, and officially adopted on 26 March 1976. 1976 also saw the organisation agree to a common date on which to commemorate Commonwealth Day, the second Monday in March, having developed separately on different dates from Empire Day celebrations.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat,</b> {{established}} in 1965, {{is the main}} intergovernmental agency of the Commonwealth, facilitating consultation and co-operation among member governments and countries. It is responsible to member governments collectively. The Commonwealth of Nations is represented in the United Nations General Assembly by the secretariat as an observer. The secretariat organises Commonwealth summits, meetings of ministers, consultative meetings and technical discussions; it assists policy development and provides policy advice, and facilitates multilateral communication among the member governments. It also provides technical assistance to help governments {{in the social and}} economic development of their countries and in support of the Commonwealth's fundamental political values.|$|E
40|$|A journal {{kept by the}} <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat's</b> Director of Information Clyde Sanger {{during the}} 1979 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Lusaka, Zambia, {{reproduced}} here {{as part of the}} Commonwealth Oral History Project. The project aims to produce a unique digital research resource on the oral history of the Commonwealth since 1965 through sixty oral history interviews with leading figures in the recent history of the organisation. It will provide an essential research tool for anyone investigating the history of the Commonwealth and will serve to promote interest in and understanding of the organisation. In addition to the 1979 Lusaka CHOGM, Sanger's Journal follows activities in Marlborough House prior to the meeting and also in Kenya, France and England afterwards, up to and including the September 1979 Lancaster House Conference in London.

40|$|In the Commonwealth, as globally, armed {{conflict}} {{has moved into}} the village, the community, {{the street and the}} home, resulting in a gendered distribution of suffering among women and girls, and men and boys. What is less well known, however, is that women have been making significant contributions to peace processes and rebuilding their societies in all phases of conflict. This book argues that gender equality needs to be placed on the policy programme of the entire spectrum of peace and conflict-related initiatives and activities in order to achieve conflict transformation. These include conflict prevention and early warning mechanisms; peace negotiations and agreements; peacekeeping, disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration; truth and reconciliation commissions; post-conflict reconstruction; and peace building and peace education. As one of the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat’s</b> publications on gender mainstreaming in key development issues, this book will be of interest to those working to achieve gender equality, peace, democracy and sustainable development, particularly in situations of armed and other forms of conflict...|$|R

Working in media and/or athletic industries (for example, Wally Szczerbiak) can also mean being moved abroad. Like most of the other careers that send employees abroad, involvement with the host culture can vary greatly.|$|E
25|$|Since 1979 cars {{operated}} by foreign embassies, high commissions, consular staff, and various international organisations {{have been given}} plates with a distinguishing format of three numbers, one letter, three numbers. The letter is D for diplomats or X for accredited non-diplomatic staff. The first group of three numbers identifies the country or organisation to whom the plate has been issued, the second group of three numbers is a serial number, starting at 101 for diplomats (although some embassies were erroneously issued 100), 400 for non-diplomatic staff of international organisations, and 700 for consular staff. Thus, for example, 101D101 identifies the first plate allocated to the Afghan embassy, and 900X400 is the first plate allocated to the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Encyclopedia was {{the fruit}} of a {{continuing}} processing of documents gathered {{from many of the}} thousands of the international organizations profiled in the Yearbook of International Organizations. Many such bodies regularly produce a wide range of material on the areas of their concern, many regularly send documents to the UIA, and many, when requested more specifically, supplied documents for the Encyclopedia. The following organizations provided documents in the greatest quantity: FAO, ILO, UNICEF, UNESCO, UNCTD, WHO, <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat,</b> Council of Europe, OECD, World Bank group. Furthermore, the United Nations Library in Geneva facilitated access to other material over two decades. The Institute of Cultural Affairs International was contractually associated at one point to the edition and other aspects of the Encyclopedia project. The Goals, Processes and Indicators of Development project (led by Johan Galtung) of the United Nations University, in which Anthony Judge participated on behalf of the UIA between 1978 and 1982, was an experience of learning and research that {{had a significant impact on}} the editorial content of the Encyclopedia. Another noticeable influence came from futures studies, with which Judge has long been associated. He reports in Encyclopedia Illusions how the narrow focus of the Club of Rome on a few socio-economic aspects of futures research prompted the much vaster exploration concerning world problems and human potential.|$|E

Other action points address gender equality, HIV/AIDS, education, the environment, youth participation in decision-making, and democracy and human rights.|$|E
40|$|A {{new round}} of Commonwealth reform {{proposals}} commenced at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting of 2009. An ensuing report, titled A Commonwealth of the people: time for urgent reform, contained {{a long list of}} proposals that eventually resulted in 2013 in the adoption of the Commonwealth Charter. Many classic international organizations are in need of reform, but this is, of course, challenging. This new Commonwealth reform process will not lead to satisfying changes and will not make it a more relevant actor in global governance. The year 2015 marks the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat’s</b> first half-century. We take this symbolic marker to push for a forward-looking exercise, arguing that because {{the true nature of the}} Commonwealth is often misunderstood, a better understanding of the organization is essential before embarking on any successful change-management project. In the article we identify four different kinds of Commonwealth: three of a ‘formal’ nature (the official, bureaucratic and the people’s Commonwealth) and a fourth ‘informal’ one (Commonwealth Plus). By describing the potential of these four different kinds of Commonwealth, we can anticipate better the challenges with which the Commonwealth network is faced, both internal (including its mandate, its British imperial past and dominance, the organization’s leadership and its membership) and external (other international organizations, other Commonwealths, rivalry with regional organizations and the rise of global policy networks). Consequently, this should lead to a better and more sustainable debate about the Commonwealth’s future role in global governance...|$|R

2500|$|New members must [...] "as {{a general}} rule" [...] {{have a direct}} {{constitutional}} link to an existing member. In most cases, {{this is due to}} being a former colony of the United Kingdom, but some have links to other countries, either exclusively or more directly (e.g. Samoa to New Zealand, Papua New Guinea to Australia, and Namibia to South Africa). The first member to be admitted without having any constitutional link to the British Empire or a Commonwealth member was Mozambique, a former Portuguese colony, in 1995 following its first democratic elections and South Africa's re-admission in 1994. Mozambique's controversial entry led to the Edinburgh Declaration and the current membership guidelines. In 2009, Rwanda became the second Commonwealth member admitted not to have any such constitutional links. It was a Belgian trust territory that had been a German colony until World War I. Consideration for its admission was considered an [...] "exceptional circumstance" [...] by the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sumukan {{had argued}} that the {{internal}} rules of the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat,</b> which prevented appeal to the UK courts, combined with the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat</b> Act which granted immunity to the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat</b> {{was a violation of}} their Article 6 rights under the European Human Rights Act, namely the right to an independent and impartial court.

50|$|The <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat</b> Act 1966, which applied retroactively {{from the}} {{establishment}} of the Secretariat in 1965, first granted the organisation full diplomatic immunity. This has been subjected to a number of lawsuits challenging this, including Mohsin v <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat,</b> and in 2005, Sumukan Limited v <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat.</b> The 1966 Act had been interpreted by English courts as allowing the courts to exercise supervisory jurisdiction under the Arbitration Act 1996 over the Commonwealth's arbitration tribunal, which had been envisaged as the sole organ to arbitrate on matters related to the Secretariat's operations in the United Kingdom. In light of this interpretation, the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat</b> Act was amended by the International Organisations Act 2005, which gave the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>Secretariat</b> Arbitral Tribunal the same legal immunity as the Secretariat itself, guaranteeing independence of the English courts.|$|E
