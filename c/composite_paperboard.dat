40|$|The extrusion-coated {{paperboard}} tray packaging {{which contains}} a tray container {{and a piece}} of lidding film is widely used along with MAP technology in fresh food packaging industry. Much research has been done on perforation onto lidding film. This research is based on the attempt of perforating on the tray materials : uncoated paperboard and paperboard coated with PE polymer or PET polymer. The study was an approach to the perforations on the paperboard and how to design its patterns. The study focused on to which degree does the perforation influences the strength of the paperboard materials. The diameter and the shape of perforations were observed. The GTR and WVTR of the materials were tested. From the comparison of 25 patterns, it is inferred that the better tensile strength could be achieved when the micro-holes placed with more distance and more uniformly. The less perforation done on horizontal direction of the sample, the better tensile properties it gains. The less destructing rows made on the samples, the better tensile strength the sample gets. More even and straight fraction surfaces appeared in MD samples, while CD samples also have slant and more layered fraction surfaces. Tensile strength in MD is close to two times higher than CD samples. These results are caused by the orientation of the fibers. The appearance differences between micro-holes of the three materials are quite obvious. For manual made perforated hole, the surface is not smooth enough. For laser made perforation, the paperboard got discoloration due to laser, perforation on uncoated board is more flat, outstanding ring circles appeared on PET and PE boards, and a few bubbles could be seen around the ring circle of PET coated board. The perforation could increase the WVTR of three kinds of boards effectively. The design of patterns and the observation of perforations could give the theoretical reference for manufactures or engineers who wants to apply the laser perforation on <b>composite</b> <b>paperboard...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} some of {{the latest}} results of a research project aimed at using <b>composite</b> corrugated <b>paperboard</b> structures for protection of products against mechanical shocks and vibration during transportation and handling. Specifically, the behaviour of multi-layered corrugated paperboard (MCPB) under shock loading is investigated. Conventionally, packaging cushion design requires the determination of the maximum expected shock levels or equivalent drop which are usually determined from statistical analysis of original field measurements. With this approach, it is generally acknowledged that the cushioning element is engineered to provide adequate protection for statistically likely events but not for extreme events with low statistical likelihood. It is reluctantly accepted that, should it occur, the latter will result in damage to the product. MCPB can be formed with a broad range of compressive characteristics and with various proportions of elastic and plastic behaviour. The objective of this experimental investigation was to determine the optimum elastic/plastic proportion to extend the protective range to include large shock levels. The experimental results obtained include the effects of compression history on the stress-strain properties of MCPB as well as the behaviour of the material in both virgin and pre-compressed form under impulsive loads. The mechanism of deformation of the corrugation...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} study aims to manufacture and characterise {{the properties of}} sandwich structures based on natural fibre composites. Bamboo tubes and flax-based composite (reinforced polypropylene and polylactide) were selected as the main materials to be investigated. Initial testing was focused on investigating {{the sensitivity of the}} tensile properties of the composites from various processing conditions and understanding the energy-absorbing characteristics of the individual bamboo tubes. Following this, bamboo honeycomb, bamboo-reinforced foam, corrugated flax-based composites, square and triangular interlocking flax-based <b>composites</b> and corrugated <b>paperboard</b> with flax-based <b>composite</b> skins were manufactured. The flax-based honeycomb and corrugated structures were manufactured using compression moulding techniques and subsequently bonded to skins based on the same material using an epoxy resin. These structures were tested in compression at quasi-static and dynamic rates of strain in order to determine their mechanical strength and specific energy absorption characteristics. It has been shown that the energy-absorbing capacity of the bamboo tubes tends to increase with decreasing inner diameter to the thickness (D/t) ratio. In addition, a chamfered profile was employed to successfully trigger the tubes to fail in a progressive manner. Bamboo tubing has been observed to offer excellent energy absorption characteristics and has potential for use inenergy-absorbing engineering applications. Tests on the flax-based composite structures have shown that the wall thickness and the number of unit cells {{have an effect on the}} strength and energy-absorbing capability of the core. The flax reinforcedpolypropylene (flax/PP) composite structures failed in buckling and fibre fracture, whereasthe flax reinforced polylactide (flax/PLA) systemfailed in buckling with delamination. Of the structures investigated here, the flax/PP cores offer superior mechanical properties to their flax/PLA counterparts. Further investigations on the effect of bonding flax/PP and flax/PLA skins to a corrugated paperboard have show that there is no significant difference in the properties between those two flax-based materials. Finally, the compression response of the square and triangular honeycomb structures has been modelled using finite element (FE) techniques. The FE model succesfully predicted the strength, energy-absorbing characteristics, buckling behaviour and failure modes observed in these natural fibre based core materials...|$|R
