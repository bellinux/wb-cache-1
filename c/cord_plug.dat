50|$|Interconnection {{couplers}} {{are similar}} to appliance couplers, but the female part is a power outlet that is built into a piece of equipment, while the male part {{is attached to a}} cord. They are identified by letters, not numbers, with one letter identifying the <b>cord</b> <b>plug,</b> and the alphabetical next letter identifying the mating appliance outlet. For example, an E plug fits into an F outlet.|$|E
50|$|For example, RJ11 {{comes in}} two forms: RJ11W is a jack {{from which a}} wall {{telephone}} can be hung, while RJ11C is a jack designed to have a <b>cord</b> <b>plugged</b> into it. A <b>cord</b> can be <b>plugged</b> into an RJ11W as well.|$|R

50|$|Wiring a 3-way lamp is {{a simple}} matter of {{connecting}} the 3-way switch's two switched live wires (frequently red for the low-wattage circuit and blue for the medium-wattage circuit) from the switch to the two live terminals on the 3-way socket. The lamp's power cord must be connected so that the wire from the wide blade on the power <b>cord</b> <b>plug</b> (neutral) connects to the neutral terminal on the socket, and the wire from the narrow blade on the plug (hot) connects to the black wire on the switch.|$|E
5000|$|Man {{is using}} {{electric}} trimmer to cut hedges around exterior of home. Trimmer is plugged into outlet on exterior of home 75 feet from where man is working. The trimmer switch {{is locked in}} the [...] "on" [...] position and in normal use. Extending {{beyond the reach of}} the trimmer's power cord, the plug is accidentally pulled from the outlet on the house 75 feet away. The man puts down the trimmer, switch still locked in the [...] "on" [...] position, and walks with his back away from the trimmer towards the outlet. A 4-year-old boy playing nearby sees the trimmer on the ground and approaches it. He picks it up with both hands. Back still turned, the man re-inserts the trimmer's power <b>cord</b> <b>plug</b> into the outlet. The trimmer starts immediately, severely injuring the boy's fingers on both hands.|$|E
50|$|Ward played {{basketball}} in school and, in one episode, tries {{to give his}} sons and their friends a few tips on the game; however, he dominates the session with his nit-picking and the boys run off to play without his interference. He is somewhat handy with tools and does a few minor repairs around the house such as fixing squeaky doors and repairing or replacing electrical appliance <b>cord</b> <b>plugs</b> because June pulls {{them out of the}} electrical outlet by the wire instead of the plug. He occasionally dries the dishes for his wife as well.|$|R
5000|$|The {{electric}} foil contains a socket underneath the guard that {{connects to the}} scoring apparatus via the body cord and a wire that runs down a channel cut {{into the top of}} the blade. Electric foil sockets are fixed so that the body <b>cord</b> <b>plugs</b> into the weapon at the fencer's wrist. There are two main varieties of socket in use today: the two-prong variety which has unequal diameter prongs and is held in place by a retaining clip, and the single-prong [...] "bayonette" [...] which twist-locks into place.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{flexible}} <b>cords</b> with <b>plugs</b> at their ends and sockets (jacks) to make temporary connections {{dates back to}} cord-type manually operated telephone switchboards (if not even earlier, possibly for telegraph circuits). <b>Cords</b> with <b>plugs</b> at both ends had been used for many decades {{before the advent of}} Moog's synthesizers to make temporary connections (patches) in such places as radio and recording studios. These became known as patch cords, and that term was also used for Moog modular systems. As familiarity developed, a given setup of the synthesizer (both cord connections and knob settings) came to be referred to as a patch, and the term has persisted, applying to systems that do not use patch cords.|$|R
5000|$|The toy line {{known as}} Billy Blastoff {{incorporated}} several {{versions of a}} four-inch-tall, plastic, child-faced adventurer produced by Eldon in the late 1960s and early 70s. The concept {{appears to have been}} licensed from Tomy (of Japan) by Eldon for distribution in the US, Canada and Europe. Billy Blastoff was sometimes packaged as a deluxe Space Set with his friend Robbie Robot (Robbie was also featured in his own packaged set). Billy and Robbie could be purchased separately or packaged with equipment in different Action Sets. Vehicles made for the figures were powered by a gear beneath the figures' pack which also held [...] "AA" [...] batteries. The battery pack could also power several figure-held accessories such as a Radar Scope, Space Gun and underwater light via jack and <b>corded</b> <b>plug.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Jad is {{well known}} for playing an untuned {{electric}} guitar. After 30 years, he still does not play in any traditional manner; in the documentary Half Japanese: The Band That Would Be King he states that [...] "you do need <b>cords</b> to <b>plug</b> the guitar in but that's pretty much it." ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} using existing in-home electrical wiring to extend the operational range of certain wireless devices. Specifically, a wireless keyboard operating at 27 MHz, which has an operational range of 1. 5 – 2 meters on its own, was extended to work throughout a 3 -story 4, 000 square foot / 371 square meter home by coupling the antenna port on its receiver to the power lines. Coupling between the keyboard and the power lines occurred over the air, and coupling at the receiver was accomplished capacitively by simply wrapping a wire connected to the receiver’s antenna port several times around a standard electrical device <b>cord</b> <b>plugged</b> into a wall socket. This phenomenon of the power line as a communications infrastructure for inexpensive and lowpower wireless devices {{has a variety of}} interesting potential avenues of research in the home...|$|R
50|$|The {{picture to}} the right shows the {{interior}} of a standard residential service, North American General Electric style breaker panel. The three power wires - two hot and one neutral - can be seen coming in at the top. The neutral wire is connected to the neutral busbar to the left with all the white wires, and the other two are the hot wires attached to the main breaker. Below it are the two rows of circuit breakers with the circuits' red and black hot wires leading off. Three wires (hot black, neutral white, and bare ground) can be seen directly exiting the box and running to a NEMA 5-15 electrical receptacle with a power <b>cord</b> <b>plugged</b> into it. The incoming bare stranded ground wire can be seen {{near the bottom of the}} neutral bus bar.|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{long history}} in {{electrical}} engineering of referring to such power plugs--that is to say, plugs with holes instead of prongs--as female, [...] particularly regarding coaxial transmission of electricity. Type N connectors, and all EC_60320#Appliance_couplers IEC 60320 [...] "appliance coupler" [...] plugs are examples of this. That said, while IEC 60320 provides gender-based standards for higher-voltage plugs (such as the cable plugged into a standard computer power supply), they have not yet defined gender-based standards for low-voltage coaxial power connectors such as those discussed herein; I.E., which component is [...] "male" [...] and which [...] "female." [...] As a result, there are varying opinions in this regard. Many industrial suppliers avoid gender terminology but many do not. Similarly, some people view the <b>corded</b> <b>plug</b> as female and some perceive it as male. [...] Some, after consideration and surveys, found that user perception of which was male and which female was evenly split.|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} and development laboratory has thousands of electrical outlets providing power to laboratories, offices, shops, and service areas. These outlets provide power {{for a wide variety}} of portable equipment and tools that are equipped with <b>cord</b> and <b>plug.</b> Electric safety requires a periodic check of outlet grounding capability and continuing inspection and repair of corded equipment. Personnel, equipment, reports, procedures, and schedule requirements are reported...|$|R
5000|$|Exposure to {{hazardous}} {{energy is}} controlled completely by unplugging the equipment from an electric outlet {{and where the}} employee doing the service or maintenance has exclusive control of the plug. This applies only if electricity is the only form of hazardous energy to which employees may be exposed. This exception encompasses many portable hand tools and some <b>cord</b> and <b>plug</b> connected machinery and equipment.|$|R
50|$|The 1970s {{brought the}} {{conversion}} to modular connector technology, replacing the hard-wired cords with cords terminated {{on both ends}} with 4P4C connectors for the handset <b>cord,</b> and 6P4C <b>plugs</b> for the line cord.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, the TV {{advertising}} {{campaign for the}} 2007 awards featured various singers and groups unrolling their own red carpets in different locations around Australia.This year MTV Advert was about {{the focus on the}} Technology park with people with white costumes with a white helmet with <b>cords</b> and <b>plugs</b> on the helmet it was shot at the technology park where the event is going to be taken place.|$|R
50|$|Some {{mechanically}} powered flashlights include additional {{functions and}} features beyond just {{a source of}} light. Models sold as emergency lights have additional functions useful in emergencies, such as flashing red or yellow lights for roadside emergencies, sirens, and AM/FM, weather or shortwave radios. They may also include alternative means of charging the battery, such as an AC adaptor, solar cells, or <b>cords</b> that <b>plug</b> into a car cigarette lighter socket.|$|R
5000|$|Supercoiled (or covalently closed-circular) DNA {{is fully}} intact with both strands uncut, {{and with an}} {{integral}} twist, resulting in a compact form. This can be modeled by twisting an extension <b>cord</b> and then <b>plugging</b> it into itself.|$|R
50|$|RJ14 is similar, but for two lines, and RJ25 is {{for three}} lines. RJ61 {{is a similar}} {{registered}} jack for four lines. The telephone line <b>cord</b> and its <b>plug</b> are more often a true RJ11 with only two contacts.|$|R
50|$|International power <b>cords</b> and <b>plug</b> {{adapters}} {{are used}} in conjunction with electrical appliances in countries different from those in which they were designed to operate. Besides a cord with one end compatible to receptacles or a device from one country and the other end compatible with receptacles or devices from another country, a voltage converter is usually necessary, as well, to protect travelers' electronic devices, such as laptops, from the differing voltages between the United States and places like Europe or Africa.|$|R
50|$|The SharkWire Online product {{centers around}} a cartridge, which {{contains}} a modem and the Mosaic web browser licensed by Spyglass, Inc. The product's operation requires Nintendo's Expansion Pak for RAM. Because the SharkWire Online cartridge is unlicensed by Nintendo, a security workaround is achieved when the user inserts a Nintendo 64 video game cartridge into the SharkWire's rear slot, with the label facing up. The keyboard and telephone <b>cords</b> are <b>plugged</b> {{directly into the}} SharkWire Online cartridge. To navigate the menus, Controller 1 must {{be attached to the}} Nintendo 64 console.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, for {{the fourth}} {{generation}} Camry, the 5S-FE was updated for the last time. This engine received a direct ignition system with external camshaft and crankshaft sensors. This system used a waste-spark design, and the coils had integrated igniters. The engine did not use a typical coil-on-plug design, but rather two coil+igniter assemblies mounted near cylinder four, and provided spark via normal high-tension <b>cords</b> (spark <b>plug</b> wires). This change means that the 1997-01 Camry 5S-FE has a blocked off distributor mounting hole and could be used with older 5S-FEs without swapping cylinder heads.|$|R
50|$|In a dream, Jillian {{sees her}} sister, Nan (Clea DuVall), killed by Spencer when she {{questions}} {{why he has}} Reese's briefcase. Jillian leaves the hospital on her own but Spencer follows her because of his connection with the twins inside her. At home, Jillian barricades the door and goes into the room where she dreamed her sister was killed. She sees her body on the floor, but then it is gone, presumably a vision. When Spencer breaks {{his way into the}} apartment, she has flooded the kitchen floor with water, with a radio in the sink and an extension <b>cord</b> <b>plugged</b> into the wall. She holds the ends of the cords in each hand and tells Spencer to stay away from her. She notices bloody nail marks on Spencer's hand and she knows that her sister really is dead, as she dreamed. She tells Spencer she doesn't know who he is, that he killed her sister and her husband. He tells her he did, and that he lived inside of her now. Water begins pouring down from the ceiling, as Jillian turned on all of the water in the bathroom upstairs. Spencer is engulfed in the water, Jillian lifts her feet off the wet floor, connects the cords and electrocutes the alien. The alien leaves Spencer's body and transmits into Jillian.|$|R
50|$|The solar {{backpack}} usually {{contains a}} flexible monocrystalline solar panel, battery, charge controller, <b>plugs,</b> <b>cords</b> and light bulbs. It provides users with power up to 120 watt-hours/day, capable of powering electronic equipment rated up to 300 W. It {{can also be}} utilized in international aid, disaster relief, emergency power and field research.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{familiar}} form of radio receiver is a broadcast receiver, often just called a radio, which receives audio programs intended for public reception transmitted by local radio stations. The sound is reproduced either by a loudspeaker {{in the radio}} or an earphone which plugs into a jack on the radio. The radio requires electric power, provided either by batteries inside the radio or a power <b>cord</b> which <b>plugs</b> into an electric outlet. All radios have a volume control to adjust the loudness of the audio, and some type of [...] "tuning" [...] control to select the radio station to be received.|$|R
50|$|Patch cords {{are often}} made of coaxial cables, with the signal carried through a {{shielded}} core, and the electrical ground or earthed return connection carried through a wire mesh surrounding the core. Each {{end of the}} cable {{is attached to a}} connector so that the <b>cord</b> may be <b>plugged</b> in. Connector types may vary widely, particularly with adapting cables.|$|R
50|$|The LGP-30 {{required}} 1500 watts when {{operating under}} full load. The power inlet <b>cord</b> was <b>plugged</b> into any standard 115 volt 60 cycle single phase line. The computer contained internal voltage regulation against power line variations of voltages from 95 to 130 volts. In addition to regulation of power line variations, the computer also contained the circuitry required to permit a warm-up stage. This warm-up stage minimized thermal shock to tubes to ensure long component life. The computer contained its own blower unit and directed filtered air, through ducts, to tubes and diodes, {{in order to}} ensure component life and proper operation. No expensive air conditioning needed to be installed if operated within a reasonable temperature range.|$|R
5000|$|A cheater plug, AC ground lifter or three-prong/two-prong adapter is an adapter {{that allows}} a NEMA 5-15P grounding-type plug (three prongs) to connect to a NEMA 1-15R non-grounding {{receptacle}} (two slots). [...] They are needed to allow appliances with 3-wire power <b>cords</b> to <b>plug</b> into legacy ungrounded (two slot) receptacles found in older buildings. The use of such an adapter avoids the need to replace receptacles, but is potentially hazardous if the grounding tab is not connected to electrical ground. A safer and more reliable alternative identified in the US and Canadian electrical codes is to replace the outlet with a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) breaker outlet. These adapters are illegal in some jurisdictions, in particular throughout Canada.|$|R
5000|$|The guitar tech does a basic soundcheck {{with the}} {{different}} guitars, amplifiers, and effects, {{to ensure that}} the equipment is functioning properly and that all of the connections between the equipment (which are made with patch <b>cords)</b> are <b>plugged</b> in correctly. For a stripped-down roots rock band guitarist, this may be as simple as plugging an electric guitar into an amplifier and plugging an acoustic guitar into a DI box and preamp/equalizer. On the other hand, a guitar tech for a heavy metal guitarist may have to set up ten or more electric guitars, a variety of amplifiers, and connect them to an intricate sequence of effects pedals, all of which is controlled by A-B routing pedals.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{vibrators}} are {{marketed as}} [...] "body massagers"—although they still may be used, {{like the ones}} sold as adult sex toys, for autoeroticism. Some vibrators run on batteries while others have a power <b>cord</b> that <b>plugs</b> into a wall socket. There is also a vibrator that uses the flow of air from a vacuum cleaner to stimulate the clitoris. Modern versions of old musical vibrators synchronize the vibrations to music from a music player or a cell phone. Some luxury brand vibrators are also completely covered in medical grade silicone with no exposed control panels or seams. Although proper cleaning is required for any sex toy, having fewer places for bacteria to grow reduces the chance of infection.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{platform}} {{sharing with}} the longer Chariot, and {{the benefit of}} development time, many of the mechanical components from past Galant contributions with new mechanism improvements, the RVR is basically reliable and robust. However, the individual is about 60,000 km Automatic Transmission capable, greet life with a <b>plug</b> <b>cord</b> about three years, would upset the sensors and around the throttle servo mechanism (such as not idling as symptoms appear), etc.|$|R
50|$|A body cord {{consists}} of three wires known as the A, B, and C lines. At the reel connector (and both connectors for Épée cords) The B pin is in the middle, the A pin is 1.5 cm {{to one side of}} B, and the C pin is 2 cm {{to the other side of}} B. This asymmetrical arrangement ensures that the <b>cord</b> cannot be <b>plugged</b> in the wrong way around.|$|R
