Also constructed are matrices for the capital reserve, the pro¯t, leverage and rate of return remaining in the trade as a function of the spot at a future date in the life of the trade. The concepts of pro¯t, capital, leverage and return are as described in Carr, Madan and Vicente Alvarez (2010).

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades the Council of Europe has {{addressed}} cultural heritage preservation policies to the use of heritage as cultural capital. Given this definition, the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> cultural <b>capital</b> is crucial, for its intrinsic value and as an investment for cultural, social and economic development. Thus, principles and areas of actions have been defined with the aim of underlying the importance of cultural values for territorial identity. Especially for cultural heritage with a potential for tourism, the decisions about valorization interventions are not always consensual, given the coexistence of different instances from local inhabitants and tourists. Selecting among the potential uses the one that could ensure the preservation of physical characters as well as intangible values, fueling economic development, is still a challenging policy and design issue. In this context, this paper proposes the use of a multi-methodological approach based on Choice Experiments and Social Multicriteria Evaluation to support the adaptive reuse on real case study.

In particular, the study concentrates on the identification of feedback loops, delays and nonlinearity in order to properly map the socio-economic and environmental system analysed and inform decision making. Results are presented for three different scenarios both for Myanmar and for Thailand. Simulation results show that a conventional approach to road construction is likely to have positive economic impacts in the region, especially in the short term, but also negative consequences for the integrity of the ecosystem, which in turn might also negatively impact on the investment itself and its economic outcomes in the medium and longer term. Further, results indicate that green economy interventions would mitigate environmental risks by creating synergies across sectors, systemically...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} an {{endogenous growth}} model which links pollution to ineffective input-use, {{which can be}} reduced through conservation capital investment. It derives {{the conditions under which}} individual preferences for environmental quality and private investment in conservation capital can lead to non-decreasing environmental quality and balanced growth in an unregulated and in a regulated regime. In the absence of regulation, balanced growth can lead to improvement in environmental quality as long as the rate of growth is low. The extent to which the growth rate is low depends upon preference for environmental quality, interest and discount rates, productivity <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>capital,</b> and price <b>of</b> the polluting input. Under an emissions tax regime, sustainable balanced growth requires the interest rate to lie between the amenity value derived by consumers from environmental improvement and the marginal return to the firm due to the regenerative capacity of the environment. This implies that interest rate must be high enough to encourage consumers to forego consumption but low enough to constrain the productivity <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>capital</b> and restrain usage of the polluting input. The emissions tax is also shown to be equivalent to a pollution permit system or to a two-instrument scheme composed of a tax on polluting input and a subsidy on conservation capital investment.

Conference of the Parties 21 (COP 21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and COP 12 of the Convention on Biological Diversity should help foster support for vastly increased investment in the better management and restoration <b>of</b> natural <b>capital.</b> Large-scale restoration demonstrably improves ecological functioning to sustain both biodiversity and human well-being. However, much progress is needed to improve the effectiveness and cost efficiency of any restoration. The ecosystem services concept provides a framework for identifying the types of restorative interventions needed to target different forms and degrees of degradation, and achieve goals related to both ecosystem health and delivery of services to people. Moreover, it can strengthen the argument for, and planning of, large-scale {{restoration and}} <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>capital.</b> We use case studies from four continents to help demonstrate how the interconnection between ecological restoration and the ecosystem services concept is being utilized in land-use planning and enlightened ecosystem management.

40|$|The global {{economic}} crisis has created {{conditions for the}} emergence of new perspectives on economic growth in the context of sustainable development. Theoretical and practical confrontation between economic growth theory and the theory <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> the natural environment revealed some unknown, uncertainties and interpretation errors. Although it is often used by economists, the term “natural capital” interpreted differently by users and therefore the approaches about its efficient use are different, ranging from proposals to limit growth in the purpose <b>of</b> the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>capital</b> to liberal attitudes based on the principle of neoclassical theory letting prices to establish economic and social importance of the environment. The global crisis has demonstrated that equilibrium between economic growth and reducing environmental impact is difficult in conditions of instability. Consequently, the problem of finding the optimal level of balance between social benefits of development and costs of environmental protection is intractable when the economic variables know a high volatility and political decision must to take into account more the social factor.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>capital</b> {{is vital for}} sustainable development. However, techniques for evaluating natural capital flows are not yet satisfactorily developed. Traditional methods in engineering, economics and other disciplines {{tend to focus on}} economic capital while ignoring the contribution of ecological resources. In this dissertation a new thermodynamic approach is proposed that addresses this shortcoming. The new approach, called Thermodynamic Input-Output Analysis (TIOA), calculates degradation of energy quality in the economic and ecological stages of the production chain of a process or product. In this analysis energy quality is measured in terms of exergy or available energy. TIOA synthesizes data about natural and human resource consumption and emissions from various public domain databases. It uses concepts from systems ecology to determine exergy flows in the ecological stages and economic input-output analysis to determine exergy flows in the economic stages of a production chain. This dissertation applies TIOA to analyze the 91 -sector 1992 and the 488 -sector 1997 representations of the US economy.

Conservation financing options vary by source from public, private, and nonprofit funders; by type from loans, to grants, to tax incentives, to market mechanisms; and by scale ranging from federal to state, national to local. [...] Conservationists have traditionally relied upon private, philanthropic capital {{in the form of}} solicited donations, foundation grants, etc., and public, governmental funds in the form of tax incentives, ballot measures, bonding, agency appropriations, etc., to fund conservation projects and initiatives. [...] Although governments and philanthropists provide a moderate amount of funds, there is a shortage in the capital required to preserve global ecosystems. On an annual basis, investors must allocate $300 to $400 billion to meet worldwide conservation needs. From this amount, funders only provide approximately $52 billion per year to conservation finance. Increasingly, conservationists are embracing a broader range of funding and financing options, leveraging traditional “philanthropic and government resources with other sources <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> including that from the capital markets." [...] These non-traditional sources <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>capital</b> include debt-financing, emerging tax benefits, private equity investments, and project financing. These additional sources of leverage serve to enlarge the pool <b>of</b> financial <b>capital</b> available to fund conservation work worldwide and, as this financial capital is invested, the asset portfolio of conserved land, water and natural resources is grown.|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{patterns}} of natural forest expansion in rural regions {{under the influence}} of urbanization processes is crucial for integrated spatial planning across the urban-to-rural gradient. As a matter of fact, forest expansion is the only natural process that may counteract the consumption <b>of</b> the ecosystem <b>capital</b> and ecosystems services of rural lands due to uncontrolled urban sprawl. The paper addresses this topic in the paradigmatic case study of the countryside of Rome (Italy), characterized by counter dynamics of forest expansion and suburbanization. Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) is applied to classify the forest landscape structure twice (1974 and 2008) according to seven categories (core, islet, perforation, edge, loop, bridge, branch) with different potential functional role as elements of a green infrastructure. Main findings are: (i) forest cover increased from 11 % to 16 % between 1974 and 2008; forest land uptake exceeds 4 % of total study area, but shows a slower pace than the growth of built-up areas (10 %); (ii) forest expansion has been to a large extent achieved by “sprawling” of islets (1. 6 % of the study area) along the stream network; (iii) more compact forest expansion has taken place on 0. 2 % of the study area in the form of additions to existing core areas or creation of new ones and (iv) the establishment of a network of protected areas nearby Rome has played a key role for the conservation and further expansion of core areas; yet, local loss of 1974 core areas stocks in a few protected areas indicates need of further law enforcement to ensure effective protection <b>of</b> the natural <b>capital</b> from degradation processes or even land conversion into built-up areas. Results calls for future in-depth investigations on the quality of newly created or maintained forest resource stocks associated to different spatial pattern structures. Integrated spatial planning strategies are outlined for the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> ecosystem <b>capital</b> and ecosystems services provided by forests, as major components of Rome’s green infrastructure.

Subsequent to that report's release, the project was installed and implemented within the District?s water-delivery infrastructure system, with actual construction costs thereby becoming known. Further, the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) was/is the agency tasked with oversight of federal legislation providing construction funding {{for up to a}} potential maximum 50 % of this project?s cost (U. S.

In a subsequent review of the project?s plan, the USBR and TWDB considered and relied upon these data in their evaluation processes. As a follow-up and as part of due diligence to the oversight mandate, the USBR wishes to validate the original federally-required criteria and the comprehensive cost-of-saving-water estimate, to the extent possible, by using the actual construction costs (as opposed to the estimate used in TR- 220 R).

Originally prepared for: "Conference on Zimbabwe: macroeconomic policy, management and performance since independence: lessons for the 21 st century," 19 - 21 August, Sheraton Hotel, Harare. Zimbabwe’s genetic, species and ecosystem biodiversity {{is a critical}} foundation of rural and national development. At the macro-level, at least 30 percent of total GDP {{is dependent on the}} use of local biological resources such as soils, forests, wildlife, aquatic organisms and ecosystems. This figure includes both primary and secondary forestry, fishing and agricultural production, as well as tourism. Approximately 75 percent of the country’s total population of almost 12 million are directly dependent upon access to biological resources for subsistence food production and generation of modest cash incomes. Given the apparent dependence of the economy on biodiversity, <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> this natural <b>capital</b> should be closely linked to positive sustainable economic growth and development. Since 1992, IMF structural adjustment programmes have guided government fiscal and monetary policies. Economic reform has seriously constrained public investment in human, man-made and natural resource capital, as well as the capacity to monitor and enforce sustainable use of biological resources. Limited empirical and considerable anecdotal evidence suggests that natural resource degradation is a serious problem in Zimbabwe, thus threatening sustainable development...|$|R
