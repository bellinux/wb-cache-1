In either case, banks anticipate future capital needs and thus target a lower ratio of business lending to capital. The coefficient of the variable Δ 1 /γ ^R+γ _t^U identifies that response. In addition, by regressing Δ L_t on Δ 1 /γ ^R+γ _t^U and on Δ K_t we abstract from the difficult problem of estimating a bank specific target capital, because such a term is left implicit in Δ 1 /γ ^R+γ _t^U.Watanabe (2007) or Berrospide and Edge (2010) highlight the difficulties inherent in estimating target <b>capital</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|R

In his research, he has examined the firm value and cost of capital results of corporate liquidity management policies and resultts of demand for liquidity by firms.

Currently, Grzegorz Marek Michalski is studying the liquidity decisions made by nonprofit organizations.

Recent grants and projects examine the effect of liquidity constraints on nonprofit organizations and for-profit small enterprises decisions to level of current assets investments, and on whether or not to use such information on cost of <b>capital</b> <b>level</b> and results on business valuation results. In ongoing work, he studies the unique risk characteristics of business organization capital, and documents the high expected returns which enterprises heavily invested in organization capital earn.

50|$|Since the {{collapse}} of socialist regime, the numbers and the scope businesses enterprises have spread dramatically like a bush fire. Most of them are owned and managed by family members although {{some of them are}} co-owned by group of individuals. Most of them are involved in different types commercial activities such retailing, wholesaling, service provision. Manufacturing industries is very limited and mostly depend on imported raw materials According to their capital base, enterprises in the region can roughly be divided into three main categories or levels: low, medium, and upper. The low <b>capital</b> <b>level</b> categories include petty trading activities solely established to generate daily subsistence for their owner managers and are not in the real sense of the word profit-oriented. Their capital base varies from less than a hundred dollar to several hundred US dollars and can be classified as survival businesses. They are mostly dominated by female and a few male individuals and have no shop centers and are run in open air.The medium level enterprises have more capital bases than the low levels. Their capital base varies from several thousands to several tenths of thousands of US dollars. Most of them are family owned or co-owned and managed by group of individuals, have shop centers, licensed, involved in provisions of goods and services.The upper level enterprises have more capital base than the other two levels. Their capital is estimated to several hundred thousands of US dollars. They are a few in numbers and are involved in either service sector such as remittance, merchandising, import-export trading, or run small scale manufacturing industries.All the three levels provide different types of employment opportunities from self-employment to paid jobs and enabled the public to have easy access to essential goods and services.Despite the sector {{plays an important role in}} the economy of the region, it is constrained by, first, absence of financial institutions for financing existing and potential business opportunities. Second, lack proximate port facilities in the coastal towns of Lughaya and Zeila cause high transportation cost of imported commodities. Third, lack affordable energy discourages potential investment opportunities. Finally, institutional capacity of the sector to provide necessary technical support services is missing.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to report}} {{the results of an}} {{investigation}} of the relationship between working <b>capital</b> <b>level,</b> measured by the cash conversion cycle and profitability of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The paper employs panel data regression analysis on a sample of 160 Alternative Investment Market (AIM) listed SMEs for the period from 2005 to 2010. The empirical results show that there is a concave relationship between working <b>capital</b> <b>level</b> and firm profitability and that there is an optimal working <b>capital</b> <b>level</b> at which firms’ profitability is maximised. Furthermore, an examination {{as to whether or not}} deviations from the optimal working <b>capital</b> <b>level</b> reduce firm profitability indicate that deviations above or below the optimum decrease profitability. The sample is limited to AIM listed SMEs, and therefore the findings cannot be generalised to all firms. Overall, the evidence suggests that firms should strive and attain the optimal working <b>capital</b> <b>level</b> in order to maximise their profitability. The results are of importance to both SMEs and policy makers providing insight into the nature of cash conversion cycle and its relationship to SMEs profitability...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of commercial banks' own internal capital targets and potential sensitivity of these levels to the business cycle. World-wide results make clear that banks' own risk is only slightly dependent on the business cycle. Banks tend to hold substantial capital buffers on top of minimum requirements, reflecting that they hold capital for other reasons than strictly meeting the capital requirements. These results suggest that actual <b>capital</b> <b>levels</b> may not become substantially more procyclical under the new risk-sensitive Basel II regime. However, a number of banks, especially smaller ones, combine a relatively risky portfolio with limited buffer capital. A more risk-sensitive capital regulation regime could force these banks to obtain higher <b>capital</b> <b>levels,</b> which would make them more procyclical.

Furthermore, these effects persist when these two measures are considered simultaneously, even though the two are highly correlated.

We consider horizontal mergers between firms that differ only in their initial <b>capital</b> <b>levels.</b> When initial <b>capital</b> <b>levels</b> are unequal, evenly distributing total capital between merging partners improves the overall cost efficiency of the merged firm. In this case, the merger often results in the multidivisional structure (the M-form) rather than the conventional structure of completely integrating merging partners because, under the M-form, the profits from aggressive production expansion backed by efficiency-improving capital reallocation {{is higher than the}} profits from output contraction and rationalization under complete integration. Such a merger enhances market competition. On the contrary, mergers between identical firms always induce complete integration. ...|$|R
40|$|Large banking {{organizations}} in the U. S. hold significantly more equity capital than the minimum required by bank regulators. This capital cushion has built up {{during a period of}} unusual profitability for the banking system, leading some observers to argue that the capital merely reflects recent profits. Others contend that the banks deliberately choose target <b>capital</b> <b>levels</b> based on their risk exposures and their counterparties’ sensitivities to default risk. In either case, the existence of “excess” capital makes it difficult to observe how banks manage their <b>capital</b> <b>levels,</b> particularly in response to regulatory changes (such as Basel II). We propose several hypotheses to explain this “excess” capital, and test these hypotheses using annual panel data for large, publicly traded U. S. bank holding companies (BHCs) from 1992 through 2006, and an innovative partial adjustment approach that allows both the target capital ratios and the speed of adjustment toward those targets to vary with firm-specific characteristics. We find evidence to suggest that large BHCs actively managed their capital ratios during our sample period. Our tests suggest that large BHCs choose target <b>capital</b> <b>levels</b> substantially above well-capitalized regulatory minima; that these targets increase with BHC risk but decrease with BHC size; that BHCs adjust toward these targets relatively quickly; and that adjustment speeds are faster for poorly capitalized BHCs, but slower (ceteris paribus) for BHCs under severe regulatory pressure.
