25|$|There are, however, {{some key}} differences. One is that, {{unlike in the}} United States, where a {{consumer}} is allowed only one free copy of their <b>credit</b> <b>report</b> a year, in Canada, the consumer may order a free copy of their <b>credit</b> <b>report</b> any number of times in a year, {{as long as the}} request is made in writing, {{and as long as the}} consumer asks for a printed copy to be delivered by mail. This request by the consumer is noted in the <b>credit</b> <b>report</b> as a 'soft inquiry', but it has no effect on their credit score. According to Equifax's ScorePower Report, Equifax Beacon scores range from 300 to 900. Trans Union Emperica scores also range from 300 and 900.|$|E

If the consumer disputes an item on a <b>credit</b> <b>report</b> obtained using the free system, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the credit bureaus have 45 days to investigate, rather than 30 days for reports obtained otherwise.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the development of}} a <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system in China. We first outline the rationale for having a <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system through reviewing the literature on asymmetric information. We then proceed to discuss how the <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system works in China. First we present a case study of a private <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> agency in Chengdu that was established in 2000. This was the first <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> agency in Chengdu and one of the earliest in China. Second, we discuss the progress the People’s Bank of China has made in establishing a unified national <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system since 2004. It is clear that China has made much progress in developing a <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system, already operating the largest <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> database in the world. There is, however, still plenty of scope for improvement including better cooperation in public and private provision of <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> services with a view to providing a more streamlined product...|$|R

25|$|The DAC {{report is}} as {{critical}} to the livelihood of a professional truck driver as the <b>credit</b> <b>report</b> is to a consumer. When a trucking company reports negative information about a truck driver, it can ruin the driver’s career by preventing him or her from finding a truck driving job for several years or more. It is widely known that trucking companies often abuse this power by willfully and maliciously reporting false information on truckers’ DAC reports, either in retaliation for seeking better paying trucking jobs elsewhere or {{for any number of}} other fraudulent, anti-competitive reasons. As long as truck drivers can be threatened with a false DAC report for standing up to management or leaving their company for a better job elsewhere, working conditions at truck driver jobs will not improve.|$|E
