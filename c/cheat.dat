Due to the unconditional security and the property of decoding without computation, VC has been applied to numerous applications such as visual authentication and identification, steganography, and image encryption. The dissertation proposed an explicit definition of <b>cheating</b> in the k-out-of-n VC. In VC, the property of applying of Human Visual System (HVS) for decoding distinguishes VC from secret sharing schemes. According to the property, the definition consists of authentic conditions, brightness condition, and security condition. Moreover, three <b>cheating</b> attack models, encryption algorithm only, known transparency, and known secret, are proposed based on the amount of the information known to the cheater. A reasonable scenario and the algorithm of the proposed <b>cheating</b> activity are used to show that <b>cheating</b> is possible in VC. According to the definition of <b>cheating,</b> Hu and Tzeng's <b>cheating</b> activities, CA- 1 and CA- 2, are not considered as a successful <b>cheating</b> activity in the k-out-of-n VC. The dissertation then proposed four <b>cheating</b> prevention schemes. The zero-bit appended <b>cheating</b> prevention scheme, the authentication based <b>cheating</b> prevention scheme (ABCP), the 2 -out-of-(n+l) VC <b>cheating</b> prevention scheme, and the homogenous secret images based <b>cheating</b> prevention scheme (HBCP). The proposed four <b>cheating</b> prevention schemes are shown to provide well solutions to deal with <b>cheating</b> attacks. With respect to Hu and Tzeng's <b>cheating</b> prevention scheme (HTCP), it suffers <b>cheating</b> activities after the proposed basis matrix filtering attack (BMFA). On the contrary, the proposed four schemes, ZACP, 2 -out-of-(n+l) VC, ABCP, and HBCP, are proven as secure as the VC scheme.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how accounting students view <b>cheating</b> actions inside and outside the classroom. It relates the love of money, a psychological variable, to the ethical perceptions of accounting students by examining their <b>cheating</b> perceptions. Design/methodology/approach – A survey is developed based on <b>cheating</b> actions and the love of money scales and administered to 213 undergraduate and graduate accounting students in two universities in the western US students' perceptions of <b>cheating</b> are measured. Students are classified according to their love of money as money-worshippers, money-repellants, or careless money-admirers. Findings – Accounting students view <b>cheating</b> actions outside the classroom as more unethical than <b>cheating</b> actions inside the classroom. The love of money is significantly related to perceptions of <b>cheating.</b> Money worshippers view <b>cheating</b> actions as more ethical followed by money-admirers and money-repellants who view such actions as more unethical. Research limitations/implications – The surveyed students may not be representative of all students in the USA. In addition, perceptions of <b>cheating</b> may not determine <b>cheating</b> behavior. Practical implications – Instructors should continue to emphasize the importance of ethical behavior. Future employers should consider the love of money as an important psychological variable related to ethical perception in their hiring decisions. Originality/value – Previous research founds that classroom <b>cheating</b> can be used to predict future workplace <b>cheating</b> among accounting employees. The study is the first to examine the relationship between the love of money and <b>cheating</b> among accounting students.
