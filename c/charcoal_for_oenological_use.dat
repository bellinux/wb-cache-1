40|$|STRUCTURAL GENOMICS IN NATIVE ISOLATEDS OF YEASTS OF ENOLOGICAL INTEREST 1040099 Biodiversity of yeast populations between {{different}} geographic locations significantly influences on differentiating characteristics of wines produced from these locations. This microbiological diversity occurs mainly at strain level, and many {{efforts have been}} carried out in this regard in order to generate experimental tools to identify and quantify these strains. These efforts have shown that most efficient strains are those derived from a structural genomic approximation. As a result, it has been possible to collect some strains that after oenological evaluations have turn into widely used commercial strains. Therefore, these strains have been released in other regions of the world. From preliminary observations conducted on collections of native yeasts <b>for</b> <b>oenological</b> <b>use,</b> the research team detected that biodiversity of yeasts from industrially intervened zones is smaller in comparison to that of zones were artisanal wine production techniques are still being used. For this reason, a need has been identified for evaluating the effect that using and intensively releasing selected yeasts would have on diversity of native yeast populations and, therefore, on the potential for quality and differentiation of wines produced in these areas. For this purpose, it has been proposed to characterize through structural genomics populations of native Chilean Saccharomyces cerevisiae and commercial strains used by the national wine industry, with the aim of determining whether the latter might have an effect on biodiversity of endemic populations. With this intention, the different collection areas were characterized based on their industrial intervention level. Subsequently, the presence of commercial yeast strains or strains recently derived from commercial strains was evaluated through an electrophoretic karyotype analysis, mitochondrial DNA restriction analysis, random amplification of polymorphic DNA, and microsatellites. Also, hybridization tubes were developed for experiments on restriction size polymorphism analysis based on repeated sequences. Moreover, various genetical-populational parameters were evaluated using information obtained from the above analyses with the purpose of characterizing populations that were evaluated and determining the most probable mechanisms for reproduction, genetic change and genic flow. Molecular characterization analyses conducted on over 300 isolated cases showed few examples of commercial strains dissemination in native ecosystems. Only two cases were identified; one in the Casablanca zone and one in the Mendoza region in Argentina. Furthermore, physiological characterization analyses suggest that S. cerevisiae endemic strains have the capability of recombining and producing viable offspring. Also, they are characterized for being mainly diploids and homozygotic. On the other hand and accordingly to the above results, yeast populations evaluated through intra and inter-population genetic diversity analyses are characterized for a scarce genetic flow between them, and for using self-fertilization as their main reproduction mechanism.
