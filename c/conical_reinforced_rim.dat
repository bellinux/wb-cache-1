Parts of this car, {{such as the}} fascia {{and body}} panels, were manufactured using a new process called reaction injection molding (RIM), in which the reactants were mixed and then injected into a mold. The addition of fillers, such as milled glass, mica, and processed mineral fibres, gave rise to <b>reinforced</b> <b>RIM</b> (RRIM), which provided improvements in flexural modulus (stiffness), reduction in {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} and better thermal stability.This technology was used to make the first plastic-body automobile in the United States, the Pontiac Fiero, in 1983. Further increases in stiffness were obtained by incorporating pre-placed glass mats into the RIM mold cavity, also known broadly as resin injection molding, or structural RIM.|$|R
40|$|Background/Purpose: An {{analytical}} {{solution is}} presented to predict the mean axial collapse forces of fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>conical</b> shells under thermal loading, in which the fibers wrapped orientation is arbitrary; Methods: Analytical method and finite element simulate; Results: The influences of thermal loading, fibers wrapped orientations, geometrical eccentricity factor and proportionality coefficient on the axial collapse force of fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>conical</b> shells are given. Conclusion: The collapse loading Pm of fiber-reinforced conical shells appears in the maximum value under different thermal environment when the fibers wrapped direction equals 45. By optimizing the wrapping orientation of fiber layers, the capability of energy absorption of fiber-reinforced conical shells can be enhanced...|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} type of Mycenaean helmet is the <b>conical</b> one <b>reinforced</b> with rows of boar tusks. This type was widely used and became the most {{identifiable}} piece of Mycenaean armor, being in use from the beginning to the collapse of Mycenaean culture. It is also known from several depictions in contemporary art in Greece and the Mediterranean. Boar's tusk helmets consisted of a felt-lined leather cap, with several rows of cut boar's tusk sewn onto it.|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{investigation of}} the use of ultrasonic consolidation (UC) to produce deck panels for small satellites was undertaken. Several fabrication methods for producing structural panels and decking were analyzed. Because of its ability to create aluminum objects in an additive fashion, and at near-room temperatures, UC was found to be a powerful solution for creating highly integrated and modular satellite panels. It also allowed a lightweight and stiff deck to be fabricated without the use of adhesives. A series of experiments were performed to understand the issues associated with creating a sandwich-type structure using UC. The experiments used a peel test apparatus to evaluate the bond strength for various geometric configurations and materials. Aluminum 3003 was chosen as the sole material constituting the deck panel. The honeycomb lattice was found to offer the best core configuration due to its ability to resist vibration from the sonotrode and provide adequate support for pressure induced by the sonotrode. Support materials for enhancing the bonding of the facings to the core were investigated but did not lead to implementation. A CAD model was created to integrate the honeycomb core, facings, and modular bolt pattern into the ultrasonically consolidated structure. The model was used to develop a build procedure for fabricating the deck on the UC machine. A finite element analysis was performed that used an equivalent properties method to represent the deck. The stiffness of a prototype deck was evaluated in a three-point bending test and the results were found to correlate with the finite element model. A sine sweep vibration test was then performed on the prototype deck panel to measure its natural frequencies. Finally, a case study was performed on a deck built for the TOROID spacecraft. A final deck panel was designed using the results from the prototype. The deck included the USUSat bolt pattern, vented honeycomb, and a <b>reinforced</b> <b>rim.</b> The cost and benefits of the final deck panel versus traditional fabrication methods were outlined...|$|R
50|$|The rim of Gioia remains nearly circular, but is {{worn and}} {{somewhat}} eroded. The exterior s have been modified by subsequent impacts, particularly {{along the western}} rim. The rim achieves its high point to the northwest, {{where it has been}} <b>reinforced</b> by the <b>rim</b> of the crater Byrd and other since-vanished formations. The interior floor is nearly flat, with a low cleft or ridge running from the midpoint to the north-northeast rim. Several tiny craterlets mark the inner floor, most notably a pair near the west-northwestern inner wall.|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{classical}} shell theory, the linear dynamic response of functionally graded carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (FG-CNTRC) truncated conical shells resting on elastic foundations subjected to dynamic loads is presented. The truncated <b>conical</b> shells are <b>reinforced</b> by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) that {{vary according to}} the linear functions of the shell thickness. The motion equations are solved by the Galerkin method and the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. In numerical results, the influences of geometrical parameters, elastic foundations, natural frequency parameters, and nanotube volume fraction of FG-CNTRC truncated conical shells are investigated. The proposed results are validated by comparing them with those of other authors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this {{research}} work, an exact analytical solution for frequency {{characteristics of the}} free vibration of rotating functionally graded material (FGM) truncated <b>conical</b> shells <b>reinforced</b> by eccentric FGM stringers and rings has been investigated by the displacement function method. Material properties of shell and stiffeners {{are assumed to be}} graded in the thickness direction according to a simple power law distribution. The change of spacing between stringers is considered. Using the Donnell shell theory, Leckhnisky smeared stiffeners technique and taking into account the influences of centrifugal force and Coriolis acceleration the governing equations are derived. For stiffened FGM conical shells, it is difficult that free vibration equations are a couple set of three variable coefficient partial differential equations. By suitable transformations and applying Galerkin method, this difficulty is overcome in the paper. The sixth order polynomial equation for w is obtained and it is used to analyze the frequency characteristics of rotating ES-FGM conical shells. Effects of stiffener, geometrics parameters, cone angle, vibration modes and rotating speed on frequency characteristics of the shell forward and backward wave are discussed in detail. The present approach proves to be reliable and accurate by comparing with published results available in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Recording of the maxillomandibular {{relationship}} (MMR) in implant complete arch restorations usually necessitates {{removal of}} the healing abutments to attach the record bases, which makes the procedures tedious and time-consuming. Materials and Methods: This article describes the procedure of recording of MMR for complete mouth rehabilitation {{with the help of}} the putty elastomeric record base cum occlusion <b>rim</b> <b>reinforced</b> with the acrylic resin framework. This technique records the MMR without removing the healing abutments from mouth and without attaching the acrylic-resin record base with wax occlusion rim. Results: The use of putty-elastomeric occlusion rim provides stable interocclusal records for implant supported complete arch (or mouth) rehabilitation. Conclusion: Maxillomandibular relationship records made with the present technique is less time-consuming and accurate with less chances of distortion of the MMR records...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the free {{vibration}} analysis and buckling behavior of functionally graded nanocomposite <b>conical</b> shell structures <b>reinforced</b> with carbon nanotubes. The effective material properties of the functionally graded nanocomposite shell structures are obtained using the extended rule of mixture by using UD and some functionally graded distribution of singlewalled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in the thickness direction of the shell. In this study the nanocomposite is forming by mixing SWCNTs as reinforced phase with the polymer as matrix phase and makes a superior quality nanocomposite material at nanoscale level with some extraordinary material properties which provides advanced performance and service level. A suitable finite element model of functionally graded conical shell structure is developed using the ANSYS parametric design language (APDL) code in ANSYS environment. The model has been discretized using an eight noded shell element. The solution is obtained for fundamental natural frequencies and deformation of the composite shell. The effects of various geometric parameters, CNT volume fraction, boundary conditions and material properties are presented and discusse...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} adjoint {{of the double}} layer {{potential}} associated with the Laplacian (the adjoint of the Neumann-Poincaré operator), as a map on the boundary surface Γ of a domain in R^ 3 with conical points. The spectrum of this operator directly reflects the well-posedness of related transmission problems across Γ. In particular, if the domain is understood as an inclusion with complex permittivity ϵ, embedded in a background medium with unit permittivity, then the polarizability tensor of the domain is well-defined when (ϵ+ 1) /(ϵ- 1) belongs to the resolvent set in energy norm. We study surfaces Γ that have {{a finite number of}} conical points featuring rotational symmetry. On the energy space, we show that the essential spectrum consists of an interval. On L^ 2 (Γ), i. e. for square-integrable boundary data, we show that the essential spectrum consists of a countable union of curves, outside of which the Fredholm index can be computed as a winding number with respect to the essential spectrum. We provide explicit formulas, depending on the opening angles of the <b>conical</b> points. We <b>reinforce</b> our study with very precise numerical experiments, computing the energy space spectrum and the spectral measures of the polarizability tensor in two different examples. Our results indicate that the densities of the spectral measures may approach zero extremely rapidly in the continuous part of the energy space spectrum. Comment: 45 pages, 8 figures.

40|$|The {{compressive}} and tensile {{material properties}} of the bovine acetabular labrum were measured. Confined compression testing {{was used to determine}} the aggregate compressive modulus and the permeability of the labrum. The compressive modulus of the labrum (0. 157 ± 0. 057 MPa) is comparable to that of the morphologically similar meniscus, and approximately one-quarter to one-half that of the adjoining acetabular cartilage. The permeability of the labrum (4. 98 ± 3. 43 × 10 - 16 m 4 /N s) was lower than that of the meniscus and cartilage, with a significantly higher resistance to interstitial fluid flow across the acetabular rim than along the rim. Specimens from the posterior and superior regions of the labrum were tested to failure in uniaxial tension. The maximum stress at failure (11. 9 ± 6. 1 MPa), maximum strain at failure (26. 5 ± 7. 6 %) and tangent modulus (74. 7 ± 44. 3 MPa) were similar to those reported for the bovine meniscus, and to other tissues composed of highly oriented collagen fiber bundles. In tension, the labrum is much stiffer (10 – 15 ×) than the adjoining articular cartilage, and the posterior region of the labrum is significantly stiffer (45 %) than the superior region. The labrum's low permeability may contribute to sealing of the hip joint. The high circumferential tensile stiffness of the labrum, together with its ring structure, <b>reinforce</b> the acetabular <b>rim</b> and may contribute to joint stability...|$|R
