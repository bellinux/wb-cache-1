5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these <b>complex</b> <b>sentence</b> constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E

40|$|The {{mastery of}} English {{compound}} and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> is of a paramount importance {{because it can}} help us to study the basic utterances of English spoken and written sentences. In addition, compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> {{can also be used}} to express ideas that are impossible to express in one word, one phrase, or even in one simple sentence. In fact, they can be used to produce the effectiveness and clarity in English oral or written communication. Thus, the analysis of errors in English compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> can be used as an input for the remedial teaching program. The present research tries to study three types of compound sentences and three types of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with the limitation on twenty five coordinators and thirty five subordinators being tested. The problems which were investigated in this study were: 1) the types of errors made by the students in constructing English compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences,</b> 2) the frequency of occurrence of each type of error made by the students in constructing compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences,</b> and 3) the areas of difficulties encountered by the students in constructing compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences.</b> With these problems, the present study had three purposes: 1) to find out the types of errors made by the students in constructing compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences,</b> 2) to find out the frequency of the occurrence of each type of error made by the students in constructing compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences,</b> and 3) to describe the areas of difficulties encountered by the students in constructing compound and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences.</b> The subjects of this study consisted of 79 sixth semester students of the English Department who were taking the translation course at Widya Mandala Surabaya Catholic University.

2500|$|By early 1975 Genie showed {{comprehension}} of simple and complex sentences where {{the object was}} the relative clause, such as [...] "The boy {{is looking at the}} girl who is frowning", or sentences where the subject was the relative clause and did not end in a noun phrase, such as [...] "The boy who is frowning is looking at the girl". However, when interpreting a <b>complex</b> <b>sentence</b> in which a relative clause ending in a noun phrase came before the main verb, such as [...] "The boy who is looking at the girl is frowning", she interpreted the noun closest to the verb as the subject. The scientists wrote that this meant that she was using a word order strategy, which they considered progress because her earlier responses to them were clearly guesses. By this time Genie could only consistently count as high as 7 in sequential order, which came at the expense of her ability to do so via gestalt perception.|$|E

By this time she understood and used intensifiers such as the word very, but only tenuously grasped superlatives. She never used them in her own speech but appeared to understand them, and while she was generally better with the suffix -est than with the word most Curtiss thought Genie might not have known the actual meaning of -est.

[...] He discussed the possibility of a country house, of taking a Martello tower as a swimming-box (as one might say a shooting-box) of living in Venice because of its artistic associations and scenic possibilities, of a flat in Westminster or a house in the West End. He also raised the question of giving up smoking and drinking, and what classes of drink were especially noxious to a man of his constitution. But discourses on all this did not prevent a parenthetical computation of the probable profits on the supposition of a thousand nights here and in America, nor did it ignore the share Kipps was to have, nor the gladness with which Chitterlow would pay that share, nor the surprise and regret with which he had learnt, through an indirect source which awakened many associations, of the turpitude of young Walshingham, nor the distaste Chitterlow had always felt for young Walshingham and men of his type. An excursus upon Napoleon had got into the torrent somehow and kept bobbing up and down.

The Romanian term propoziÈ›ie means as much as simple sentence (or clause). To describe a <b>complex</b> <b>sentence</b> (or compound sentence), Romanian uses the word frazÄƒ, which can cause confusion with the English word phrase, which describes not a <b>complex</b> <b>sentence,</b> but a grouping of words.

40|$|Relevance of {{research}} {{is due to the}} scientific need to systematize reasons of syntactic structures in the works of influencing the choice of the writer at work writing. On this basis, the need of clarifying the factors that influenced the choice of writer for writing the work is updated. This means that researchers pay attention not only to structural, semantic and communicative features of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences,</b> but special attention pay to the study of their writing potential. Of course, expressive features and functions of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> that are directly involved in its formulation and design composition are shown in fiction. In the contextual environment we are able to explore more features of such syntactic structures. To constructions that were not the subject of this comprehensive analysis, are <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with subordinate purposes and reasons as varieties of sentences dismembered with a meaning of condition in the novels by Boris Kharchuk Â«The SquareÂ», Â«Borders and ImmensityÂ». The object of our scientific research is <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with subordinate purposes and reasons as a variety of sentences of segmented structure with the meaning of condition in the novels by Boris Kharchuk Â«The SquareÂ», Â«Borders and Immensity. Â» The aim of this research is to define the features of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with subordinate purposes and reasons in both kinds of sentences with segmented structure and their role in Boris Kharchukâ€™s texts. The aim involves the following tasks: describe the linguistic status of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with subordinate purposes and reasons (both kinds of sentences segmented structure with the meaning of condition in modern science); to analyze and justify the use of such structures (based on novels by Boris Kharchuk Â«The SquareÂ», Â«Borders and ImmensityÂ»). Results and conclusions. At the material of Boris Kharchukâ€™s novels Â«The SquareÂ», Â«Borders and ImmensityÂ» 77 <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with subordinate purpose are discovered, which is 45, 8 %, and 45 sentences of reasons, which is 26, 8 % of all <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> segmented structure with the meaning of condition. Monitoring the operation of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with subordinate purposes in the works of Boris Kharchuk confirms their broad use. These statistical processing of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> of this kind, drawn from novels, clearly show that they make up 45, 8 % of all analyzed segmented structure of <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with a meaning of condition. This sentence structures perform a variety of functions: help to express the position of the author as for depicted events, reveal the inner world of the hero, a true atmosphere of sincere conversation. <b>Complex</b> <b>sentences</b> with subordinate reason in the analyzed novels by B. Kharchuk are also represented, though not distinguished by the diversity of communication. They dominate in the stories of the characters, monologues and dialogues, landscape descriptions. These designs clearly eliminate ambiguity of complexity and provide high culture expression. General contractors and sentences with purpose and reason with contractors play an important role and {{are an integral part of}} the language sys-tem texts of B. Kharchuk. Their functioning, semantic and stylistic role is regulated by individual authorâ€™s style. Most sentences contain emotional and evaluative components, help to outline the spiritual ideals of the writer, his inner world and feelings. Certified units demonstrate the wealth of authorâ€™s artistic language. In this work we described only two types of sentences.
