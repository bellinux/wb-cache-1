40|$|Introduction: The main {{objective}} of root canal treatment is to disinfect the entire root canal system. Although cleaning and shaping {{and use of}} antimicrobial medicaments are effective in reducing the bacterial load some bacteria do remain behind and multiply, causing reinfection of the canal. Considering the ineffectiveness, potential side effects and safety concerns of synthetic drugs, the herbal alternatives for endodontic usage might prove to be advantageous. Aim: To check the antimicrobial efficacy of Neem, Green Tea, Triphala and sodium hypochlorite against the endodontic microflora. Materials and Methods: Mixed <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> bacteria were isolated from patients, with carious teeth and associated with periapical radiolucencies. A paper point was inserted into the canal to obtain a sample <b>of</b> a mixed <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> <b>organisms.</b> These paper points were cultured and agar diffusion test was done for the different irrigants. The irrigants were divided into Group I: Neem (60 mg/ml in 10 % DMSO),Group II: Green Tea Polyphenols (60 mg/ml in 10 % DMSO), Group III: Triphala (60 mg/ml in 10 % DMSO), Group IV: 3 % NaOCI, Group V: Sterile saline. Results: Sodium hypochlorite showed the maximum antimicrobial activity, followed by Neem. There was no statistical difference between the activity of sodium hypochlorite and Neem. This was followed by Triphala and Green Tea, respectively. Conclusion: Neem is as effective as Sodium Hypochlorite against endodontic microflora...|$|R

The phenol content was measured using HPLC techniques, and results were obtained showing that the bacterium had most effect in reducing the phenol content of alpechin at concentrations of between 40 and 100 %.

In contrast to soluble proteins, where many factors have already been identified, the mechanisms by which the thermostability of membrane proteins is enhanced are almost unknown. The hydrophobic membrane environment constrains possible stabilizing factors for transmembrane domains, so that a difference might be expected between soluble and membrane proteins. Here we present sequence analysis of predicted transmembrane helices of the genomes from eight thermophilic and 12 mesophilic organisms. A comparison of the amino acid compositions indicates that more polar residues {{can be found in}} the transmembrane helices of thermophilic organisms. Particularly, the amino acids aspartic acid and glutamic acid replace the corresponding amides. Cysteine residues are found to be significantly decreased by about 70 % in thermophilic membrane domains suggesting a non-specific function of most cysteine residues in transmembrane domains of mesophilic organisms. By a pair-motif analysis of the two sets of transmembrane helices, we found that the small residues glycine and serine contribute more to transmembrane helix–helix interactions in thermophilic organisms. This may result in a tighter packing of the helices allowing more hydrogen bond formation...|$|R
