5|$|Although {{psychodrama}} is {{not widely}} practiced, {{the work done}} by practitioners of psychodrama has opened the doors to research possibilities for other psychological <b>concepts</b> <b>such</b> as group therapy and expansion {{of the work of}} Sigmund Freud. The growing field of drama therapy utilizes psychodrama as one of its main elements. The methods of psychodrama are also used by group therapy organizations and also find a place in other types of therapy, such as post-divorce counseling for children.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} vector spaces {{is due to}} the construction of function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra and the new field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key <b>concepts</b> <b>such</b> as spaces of p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces. Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.|$|E
5|$|Chinese astrology has a close {{relation}} with Chinese philosophy (theory {{of the three}} harmonies: heaven, earth and man) and uses <b>concepts</b> <b>such</b> as yin and yang, the Five phases, the 10 Celestial stems, the 12 Earthly Branches, and shichen (時辰 a form of timekeeping used for religious purposes). The early use of Chinese astrology was mainly confined to political astrology, the observation of unusual phenomena, identification of portents and the selection of auspicious days for events and decisions.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{appear in}} popular culture in <b>concepts</b> <b>such</b> as fly-on-the-wall documentary-making in film and {{television}} production. The metaphoric name suggests that events are seen candidly, as a fly might see them. Flies have inspired the design of miniature flying robots. Steven Spielberg's 1993 film Jurassic Park relied {{on the idea that}} DNA could be preserved in the stomach contents of a blood-sucking fly fossilised in amber, though the mechanism has been discounted by scientists.|$|E

As of 2017, much of the detailed knowledge of Ariel derives from a single flyby of Uranus performed by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in 1986, which managed to image around 35% of the moon's surface. There are no active plans at present to return to study the moon in more detail, although various <b>concepts</b> <b>such</b> as a Uranus orbiter and probe have been proposed from time to time.|$|E
5|$|Many number systems, {{such as the}} {{integers}} and the rationals enjoy {{a naturally}} given group structure. In some cases, such as with the rationals, both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures. Such number systems are predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as rings and fields. Further abstract algebraic <b>concepts</b> <b>such</b> as modules, vector spaces and algebras also form groups.|$|E
5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} calculates {{the greatest}} common divisor (GCD) of two natural numbers a and b. The {{greatest common divisor}} g is the largest natural number that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder. Synonyms for the GCD include the greatest common factor (GCF), the highest common factor (HCF), the highest common divisor (HCD), and the greatest common measure (GCM). The greatest common divisor is often written as gcd(a,b) or, more simply, as (a,b), although the latter notation is also used for other mathematical <b>concepts,</b> <b>such</b> as two-dimensional vectors.|$|E

In particular, we give a continuous-time and discrete-time linear TV filter interpretation to continuous-time FT and discrete Fourier transform (DFT), respectively. As a consequence, important variants such as warped DFT, DCT, DST also can be viewed as linear TV filtering operations. Extending these results, we show that shorttime Fourier transform (STFT) {{can be viewed as a}} linear TV filterbank operation, thereby interpreting time-varying spectrum of a signal as the output of a linear TV filterbank...|$|R

E also inherits elements of these Chinese dialects' phonology and compound word formation. E morphology is primarily analytic, with <b>concepts</b> <b>such</b> as negation expressed with auxiliary words (pat6, m2) and no pronominal agreement.|$|E
5|$|W. W. Thomas, {{superintendent}} of the Springfield public-school system, believed that home-ownership and citizenship responsibilities {{were a part of}} education and was a key instigator of the project. He involved students in the governmental duties associated with the project, which used the manager-commission form of government to run the lilliputian city. <b>Concepts</b> <b>such</b> as women’s suffrage and political ambition came into play. A 14-year-old orphaned girl was elected Tiny Town's mayor and a 15-year-old boy became its city manager, defeating sixteen other nominees in a political campaign.|$|E
5|$|Chapter seven {{deals with}} conceptions of {{morality}} and ethics, arguing that whereas High Magic typically envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe {{as a part of}} moral discourse. She looks at the internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining <b>concepts</b> <b>such</b> as that of the Qliphoth, before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.|$|E

5|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} {{immaterial}} <b>concepts</b> <b>such</b> as {{the soul and}} afterlife. At times, however, {{the very concept of}} the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given that it has no inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E
5|$|Mathematics has {{directly}} influenced {{art with}} conceptual {{tools such as}} linear perspective, the analysis of symmetry, and mathematical objects such as polyhedra and the Möbius strip. Magnus Wenninger creates colourful stellated polyhedra, originally as models for teaching. Mathematical <b>concepts</b> <b>such</b> as recursion and logical paradox {{can be seen in}} paintings by Rene Magritte and in engravings by M. C. Escher. Computer art often makes use of fractals including the Mandelbrot set, and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as cellular automata. Controversially, the artist David Hockney has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the camera lucida to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that Vermeer used the camera obscura in his distinctively observed paintings.|$|E
5|$|Taxonomy in the Middle Ages {{was largely}} based on the Aristotelian system, with {{additions}} concerning the philosophical and existential order of creatures. This included <b>concepts</b> <b>such</b> as the Great chain {{of being in the}} Western scholastic tradition, again deriving ultimately from Aristotle. Aristotelian system did not classify plants or fungi, {{due to the lack of}} microscope at the time, as his ideas were based on arranging the complete world in a single continuum, as per the scala naturae (the Natural Ladder). This, as well, was taken into consideration in the Great chain of being. Advances were made by scholars such as Procopius, Timotheos of Gaza, Demetrios Pepagomenos, and Thomas Aquinas. Medieval thinkers used abstract philosophical and logical categorizations more suited to abstract philosophy than to pragmatic taxonomy.|$|E

5|$|The game {{supports}} {{up to six}} {{human or}} artificial intelligence players in local and online multiplayer, except on the PlayStation 4, which has a human player limit of four per console. Videoball has team and ranked matchmaking multiplayer modes. There is no set practice game mode, but players can train against computer-controlled opponents in exhibition matches and the scenario-based Arcade mode, in which the player faces two computer-controlled opponents in specific level configurations. The Arcade mode artificial intelligence personalities each have fitting names, such as Homer (who stays near its endzone) and Punchy (who bullies players with projectiles). Some work in pairs to establish gameplay <b>concepts,</b> <b>such</b> as Tippy, who passes the ball to Toppy, who maintains {{the top of the}} field.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} plan for Luigi's Mansion involved a game where the levels revolved {{around a large}} mansion or complex. Tests were later done with Mario characters in dollhouses and such. Once it was transitioned into a GameCube project, Luigi {{was selected as the}} main character {{in order to keep the}} game original and new. The other gameplay ideas, such as ghosts and the ghost-sucking vacuum cleaner, were added later. Older <b>concepts,</b> <b>such</b> as a role-playing game-like system which made real-time changes to rooms, as well as an underground cave area located under the mansion, were also scrapped due to the inclusion of the new ideas.|$|E
5|$|Feminism {{became a}} {{principal}} concern of musicologists in the 1980s {{as part of}} the New Musicology. Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of canon, genius, genre and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked. Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like Susan McClary, Marcia Citron and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. <b>Concepts</b> <b>such</b> as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and education of women; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.|$|E
