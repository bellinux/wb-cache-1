In the Dutch National Vegetation Overview, three associations belonging to the Lonicero-Rubion silvatici were distinguished, viz. the Rubetum grati, Rubetum silvatici, and Rubetum pedemontani. During several vegetation mapping projects and Rubus excursions, a distinct type of bramble scrub was recorded repeatedly in the Campine in the province Noord-Brabant {{in the southern part}} of the Netherlands. In this paper, this scrub is described as a new association, the Rubetum taxandriae Haveman, de Ronde & Weeda, with R. taxandriae, R. campaniensis, and R. baronicus as <b>character</b> <b>species,</b> and R. insectifolius as regional <b>character</b> <b>species.</b> Variation, ecology and distribution of this new association are given and discussed, and two subassociations are distinguished.

Based on an earlier analysis of the centres of diversity of the genus Rubus in the Netherlands, it is supposed that the Rubetum silvatici in its circumscription in the Dutch National Vegetation Overview can be divided in more regionally distributed communities, partly as subassociations of the Rubetum silvatici, partly as independent associations...|$|E

40|$|Slug assemblages in NW Germany (Gastropoda: Milacidae, Boettgerillidae, Limacidae, Agriolimacidae, Arionidae) : {{a result}} of the mapping survey of Northrhine-Westphalia. This survey {{provides}} information on inter-specific associations of slugs on a regional data base. Most of the data originate from the last ten years. In total, 25 slug species are known from the federal state Northrhine-Westphalia, Germany. A rough classification using two <b>character</b> <b>species</b> resulted in three groups. These groups correspond to habitat preferences, i. e. species that are regularly found together with Arion rufus usually occur in close-canopy forests and mid-successional stages, species that are regularly found together with Arion lusitanicus prefer open habitats to mid-successional stages, and the intermediate group inhabits either only midsuccessional stages, or all habitat types. This relation held true {{with the exception of one}} rare species, Deroceras agreste. This species was classified as intermediate based on the <b>character</b> <b>species,</b> but so far was only found in open habitats. This seemingly conflicting result is the outcome of a recent species turnover in open habitats. In some of the site, Deroceras agreste still co-occurred with Arion rufus, whereas in others the invasive species Arion lusitanicus had already established. In the last decades, Arion rufus has lost almost all sites in open habitats. Nowadays, it is mainly restricted to close-canopy forests that seem not to be invaded by Arion lusitanicus...|$|E
40|$|Vegetation {{and soil}} seed banks of a {{threatened}} Atlantic fen meadow community were studied using recent phytosociological records and seedling emergence from soil samples. Similarly managed but differently degraded stands that suffered {{different levels of}} species impoverishment were compared. The actual vegetation was related {{to a set of}} phytosociological references representing the subassociations of the community. DCA positions of reference relevés from the different subassociations were overlapping, suggesting that in all references many common species occur. Recent records were positioned in-between the seed bank samples and the references. The soil seed banks of all stands were dominated by ordinary species. Most <b>character</b> <b>species</b> had at most sparse seed banks and no seedlings of locally extinct <b>character</b> <b>species,</b> mentioned in historic floristic records, were detected. In contrast species of pioneer and small-sedge communities {{as well as those of}} heathlands were abundant in the seed banks. Based on the vertical distribution of seeds in the soil layers most fen meadow species were classified into transient or short-term persistent seed bank types. We concluded that complete restoration of the Cirsio dissecti-Molinietum without reintroduction is only likely in stands that were degraded only a few years ago. On the other hand, the presence of viable seeds of Nanocyperion and Parvocaricetea species is promising for the restoration of these communities even after decades. Recreation of pioneer habitats by sod cutting will preserve these species. ...|$|E

A total number of 294 taxa were documented with 1063 occurrence data, the majority (264 taxa, 784 data) from S-PIC, a lower number (90 taxa, 279 data) from PIN-S. Constant <b>character</b> <b>species</b> from all stands were Lactarius helvus, Russula decolorans and Russula paludosa. In the S-PIC stands several widespread spruce-connected species were fructifying. Because of their high data number, Cortinarius sanguineus, Hypholoma capnoides, Lactarius lignyotus, Lactarius picinus, Leccinum vulpinum, Pholiota flammans, Russula vinosa and Tylopilus felleus can be highlighted.

In the absence of true <b>character</b> <b>species,</b> the species from other syntaxa of the same formation can be used as such. Our proposal is to use the species group from every formation-true class only once within every marginal alliance, {{to limit the number of}} possible marginal associations. This approach is illustrated in a classification of the retamoid thickets in the Netherlands.

Methods We used twinspan analysis to distinguish hierarchically ordered phytogeographical regions using grid-based distributional patterns of bramble species, Dufrêne–Legendre indicator species analysis to define <b>character</b> <b>species</b> for the regions, and descriptive statistical analysis of broad-scale abiotic factors derived from the LANMAP landscape classification for each region. Results Grid cells were classified into 114 initial groups and 12 regions (florulas), forming three major bramble territories. Up to 15 indicator species could be assigned to each florula. The florulas in the British Isles are geographically isolated, unlike those on the continent. The florulas differ in minimum temperature in January, mean precipitation in August, and elevation. Although {{a clear view of}} the relationship between the bramble flora in the British Isles and the continental flora is obscured by the lack of data from Belgium and France, the major biogeographical patterns coincide with the genetic structure of the genus as published by Sochor et al. (2015). Other factors forming the basis for the observed patterns are isolation (especially in the British Isles), and arguably also landscape history and landscape patterns. Main conclusions Phytogeographical patterns in Rubus subg. Rubus are strongly influenced by historical factors and can be traced back to the hybridization of sexual Rubus ulmifolius, Rubus canescens and Rubus ser. Glandulosi especially. Geographical and ecological factors also play a role in the realization of large-scale patterns, but these factors seem to be closely tied to the history and genetic structure of the genus through inherited ecology from the ancestral species<br/...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{need for}} {{classifying}} vegetation {{in a more}} precise way is evident. Also, {{there is a need}} to provide a hierarchical classification scheme that will match changes in image characteristics as one moves through the scales from space to conventional aerial photography. Such refined classifications of vegetation are the first steps toward a better understanding of the potentialities and limitations of a specified area which help in the detection of analogous environmental conditions for resource allocation and management purposes. These needs become more urgent as use and competition for natural resources and land increases. The first approximation of a classification scheme may meet these needs for a test site in the Tombstone, Arizona, vicinity. This classification task was accomplished by the use of a "hierarchical- polythetic-agglomerative" package using presence-absence data and standardized cover estimates, The following tentative associations and a variant were found upon division of the original data into groups of convenient size to meet the limitations of the programs: Association A (Panicum hirticaule/Tidestromia lanuginosa- Boerhaavia coulteri) la (a variant of Association A) Association B (Rhus microphylla-Dalea formosa) Association C (Gutierrezia sarothrae/Eriogonum abertianum) Association D (Menodora scabra/Tridens grandiflorus) Association E (Hilaria belangeri) Association F (Gilia rigidula-Rhynchosia texana) Association G (Hilaria mutica/Eriochloa gracilis/Crotalaria pumila) Association H (Haplopappus tenuisectus /Eragrostis lehmanniana) As sociation I (Ayenia pusilla/Eragrostis intermedia) Association J (Cnidoscolus angustidens) Association K (typical association lacking <b>character</b> <b>species)</b> of Alliance III (Fouquieria splendens-Acacia constricta-Aloysia wrightii) Association L (Agave palmeri-Agave parryi/Haplopappus laricifolius) Association M (Mortonia scabrella) These were grouped by the classification into units of higher rank. Association (A), (B), and the variant (la) grouped into an alliance with the <b>character</b> <b>species,</b> Acacia vernicosa-Larrea tridentata-Flourensia cernua, Associations (C), (D), (E), and (F) grouped into the Yucca elata/Bouteloua eriopoda Alliance; and Associations (I), (J), and (K) were held together in an Alliance by the <b>character</b> <b>species,</b> Fouquieria splendens-Acacia constricta-Aloysia wrightii. Validity of the character and differential species as association and subassociation "identifiers" was tested by the use of stepwise discriminant analysis. Two hierarchical levels and two runs per group were carried out using this analysis. A perfect discrimination between or among the groups was found at all levels except one. Species identified as differential or <b>character</b> <b>species</b> in the classification process were found to be the best discriminants. This suggests that the vegetation units identified by these species are valid. The "hierarchical-polythetic-agglomerative" approach to vegetation classification provides the kind of framework which is compatible with the classical phytosociological techniques of vegetation study. It eliminates, however, the cumbersome task of hand sorting and tabulation and increases the capacity of complex operations as well as introduction of more systematic and thorough evaluation into the analysis. This approach of classifying vegetation appears to be suited for survey-type studies in areas where vegetation information is limited and the need exists for an initial classification in order to begin more comprehensive quantitative studies. This does not preclude using the method for other purposes. Because it is a hierarchical method, one can go into as much classification detail as is dictated by the purpose of the vegetation study. This last feature is well suited to the use of the results in interpretation of multiscale photography so important in the field of resource analysis. Research needs to be done to answer the very fundamental question of why Euclidean distance (as a measure of similarity) and Ward's method (as a sorting strategy) provided a more adequate hierarchical classification scheme when presence and absence data are used rather than standardized values. Research is needed on the most effective criteria to divide large data sets into groups of the appropriate size. Results of this classification now need to be tested by practical field use in the recognition of ecosystems and their mapping on appropriate scales of remote sensing imagery. To aid the practical user of this information, a dichotomous key to the phytosociological classes was developed. This requires the recognition of 8 species to make classifications at alliance level and 32 species to achieve the association separations. A key for subassociation level was not prepared because the practical value of this level is somewhat in doubt...|$|E
