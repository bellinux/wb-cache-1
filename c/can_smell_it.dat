500|$|The road meanders through forest {{lands and}} fields as it {{continues}} northwesterly toward the Log Slide. This location gives motorists {{a chance to}} hike down to the lakeshore to see the Au Sable Point Lighthouse peeking above the trees {{to the east and}} the Grand Sable Dunes to the west. The American Motorcyclist Association said of this segment of the roadway that it is [...] "so close to the beach and lake that [...] <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> <b>it</b> when [...] rides." [...] The lighthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and can be accessed from the Hurricane River Campground. The roadway crosses the Hurricane River and turns southerly away from Lake Superior. H-58 turns back eastward near Grand Sable Lake, running between the north shore of the lake and the Grand Sable Dunes on the south shore of Lake Superior. At the intersection with William Hill and Newburg roads, H-58 makes a 90° curve and travels northward for about three-quarters of a mile (1.2km). The road turns back eastward next to the Sable Falls parking lot. This lot also marks the eastern end of the segment of H-58 that road crews do not plow. The roadway exits the national park and runs to the community of Grand Marais. On the edge of town is the Woodland Township Park where hikers can walk along the beach {{to the base of the}} Grand Sable Dunes that form the east end of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. These dunes reach heights of up to [...] at a 35° incline. Hikers are advised to use the access points along H-58 to get to the dunes instead of attempting the climb up the face.|$|E

It could scarce be said to better my position, but the step quieted the woman; and, on the other hand, I could not think I was taking much risk, for the shares in question (they were those of what I will call the Catamount Silver Mine) had fallen some time before to the bed-rock quotation, and now lay perfectly inert, or were only kicked (like other waste-paper) about the kennel of the exchange by bankrupt speculators.|$|E

There have come three or four days, since I arrived in London, of so fine and mellow a warmth, of skies so tenderly blue, and so heaped with such soft masses of white clouds, that one wonders what there was ever to complain of. In the parks and in the gardened spaces which so abound, the leaves have grown perceptibly, and the grass thickened so that you <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> <b>it,</b> if you cannot hear it, growing.

From the delectable vision rises a subtile haze, which veils the day just a little from its own loveliness, and lies upon the sighing and expectant city like the substance of a dream made visible. It has the magic to transmute you to this substance yourself, so that while you dawdle afoot, or whisk by in your hansom, or rumble earthquakingly aloft on your omnibus-top, you are aware of being a part, very dim, very subtile, of the passer's blissful consciousness.

Gibson (1966) (pp. 54 – 55) In this paper, we offer a theory of cross-modal objects. We agree with Gibson’s assertion that such a theory is unlikely to be an asso-ciative theory. Instead, our theory is built on the notion of privileged inter-modal binding. As an example of such privileged binding, we will examine the relation between visible impacts and percussive sounds, which allows for a particularly powerful form of binding that produces audio-visual objects. To motivate these conclusions we devote the first two sections of this article to a review of Kubovy and Van Valkenburg’s (2001) theory of auditory and visual objects. In the final section, we present our new approach and present empirical data to support our view...|$|R

Spencer recalled that, [...] "Babies don't tend to survive for long in Royal Court plays (Remember Edward Bond's [...] Saved?) and poor Cara spends much of the time crying, horribly realistically, in her buggy, shredding the nerves of every parent in the audience", but found, [...] "It's worth enduring, though, not only for the power and truth of both writing and performances, but also for the tentative glimmer of hope at the end". Assessing the cast's performances, he judged that [...] "Kate O'Flynn brings an astonishingly raw vulnerability to the stage as Amy … Sorcha Cusack plays the grandmother with a robust humanity that warms this punishing play; Russell Tovey has a terrifying touch of the psycho about him as the squaddie, while Gerard Horton as his father shows how man hands on misery to man". Spencer concluded his review by writing, [...] "With a bleakly atmospheric rural design by Patrick Burnier that is so real you <b>can</b> actually <b>smell</b> <b>it</b> and a tense, gutsy production by Lyndsey Turner, this proves a shattering full-length debut by 26-year-old Molly Davies".|$|R
