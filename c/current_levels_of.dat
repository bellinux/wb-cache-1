25|$|When burned, {{petroleum}} releases carbon dioxide, {{a greenhouse}} gas.

25|$|For example, in the U.S., {{reducing}} the deer population to levels of 8 to 10 {{per square mile}} (from the <b>current</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> 60 or more deer per square mile {{in the areas of}} the country with the highest Lyme disease rates), may reduce tick numbers and reduce the spread of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. However, such a drastic reduction may be very difficult to implement in many areas, and low to moderate densities of deer or other large mammal hosts may continue to feed sufficient adult ticks to maintain larval densities at high levels. Routine veterinary control of ticks of domestic animals, including livestock, by use of acaricides can contribute to reducing exposure of humans to ticks.|$|E
25|$|When European colonials {{entered a}} region, they {{invariably}} brought new resources and capital management. Different investment strategies were employed, which included focuses on health, infrastructure, or education. All colonial investments have had persistent effects on postcolonial societies, but {{certain types of}} spending {{have proven to be}} more beneficial than others. French economist Elise Huillery conducted research to determine specifically what types of public spending were associated with high levels of current development. Her findings were twofold. First, Huillery observes that the nature of colonial investments can directly influence <b>current</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> performance. Increased spending in education lead to higher school attendance; additional doctors and medical facilities decreased preventable illnesses in children; and a colonial focus on infrastructure translated into more modernized infrastructure today. Adding to this, Huillery also learned that early colonial investments instituted a pattern of continued spending that directly influenced {{the quality and quantity of}} public goods available today.|$|E
500|$|Predator-prey {{interactions}} are an introductory concept into food-web studies {{as well as}} behavioural ecology. Prey species can exhibit different kinds of behavioural adaptations to predators, such as avoid, flee, or defend. Many prey species are faced with multiple predators that differ {{in the degree of}} danger posed. To be adapted to their environment and face predatory threats, organisms must balance their energy budgets as they invest in different aspects of their life history, such as growth, feeding, mating, socializing, or modifying their habitat. Hypotheses posited in behavioural ecology are generally based on adaptive principles of conservation, optimization, or efficiency. For example, [...] "he threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that prey should assess the degree of threat posed by different predators and match their behaviour according to <b>current</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> risk" [...] or [...] "he optimal flight initiation distance occurs where expected postencounter fitness is maximized, which depends on the prey's initial fitness, benefits obtainable by not fleeing, energetic escape costs, and expected fitness loss due to predation risk." ...|$|E

500|$|The Sun's energy, stored by plants (primary producers) during photosynthesis, {{passes through}} the food chain to other organisms to {{ultimately}} power all living processes. Since the industrial revolution the concentrated energy of the Sun stored in fossilized plants as fossil fuels {{has been a major}} driver of technology which, in turn, has been the source of both economic and political power. In 2007 climate scientists of the IPCC concluded that there was at least a 90% probability that atmospheric increase in CO2 was human-induced, mostly as a result of fossil fuel emissions but, to a lesser extent from changes in land use. Stabilizing the world's climate will require high-income countries to reduce their emissions by 60–90% over 2006 levels by 2050 which should hold CO2 levels at 450–650ppm from <b>current</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> about 380ppm. Above this level, temperatures could rise by more than 2°C to produce [...] "catastrophic" [...] climate change. Reduction of current CO2 levels must be achieved against a background of global population increase and developing countries aspiring to energy-intensive high consumption Western lifestyles.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] Kyoto Protocol {{implemented}} {{the objective of}} the UNFCCC to fight global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to [...] "a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system" [...] (Art. 2).

2500|$|<b>Current</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> {{groundwater}} extraction far {{exceed the}} level of natural recharge: Groundwater is being [...] "mined". For example, the Al-Ahsa aquifer in the Eastern Province experienced a drop of 150 meters over the past 25 years. Since the usable volume of the aquifers is not known, {{it is not clear}} how long groundwater mining can be sustained. Estimates of the groundwater stored in the principal aquifers are controversial. According to one estimate, the amount of water stored before modern farming started was 500 billion cubic meters, equivalent to the amount of water in Lake Erie, and by 2012 about 80% of that water had been extracted.|$|E
2500|$|The {{social cost}} of carbon is the {{additional}} {{damage caused by}} an additional ton of carbon emissions. ... The optimal carbon price, or optimal carbon tax, is the market price (or carbon tax) on carbon emissions that balances the incremental costs of reducing carbon emissions with the incremental benefits of reducing climate damages. ... f a country wished to impose a carbon tax of $30 per ton of carbon, this would involve a tax on gasoline of about 9 cents per gallon. Similarly, the tax on coal-generated electricity would be about 1 cent per kWh, or 10 percent of the current retail price. At <b>current</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> carbon emissions in the United States, a tax of $30 per ton of carbon would generate $50 billion of revenue per year.|$|E
