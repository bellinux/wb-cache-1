50|$|Rhapsody is {{the true}} finish {{to the line of}} Requiem, graded E8 6b. Requiem was climbed in 1983 by Dave Cuthbertson {{and was one of the}} hardest rock climbs in the world at the time. It follows a <b>crackline</b> which fades out to a seam at half height. Requiem follows a flake heading rightwards to finish, while Rhapsody climbs the line of the crack all the way to the top. The top half of the crack gives 8c+ {{climbing}} and takes no more protection. MacLeod took many long falls from this runout, three from the last move in which he fell 70 feet and injured himself by hitting the rock at the end of the fall. In 2008 Steve McClure made the third ascent of Rhapsody and confirmed the grade. The ascent of Rhapsody is the subject of the movie E11 (2006) directed by Paul Diffley and produced by Hot Aches Productions. MacLeod has since featured in several more climbing films by Hot Aches Productions.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel mesh {{structure}} for representing the motion in occlusion areas for video analysis and video coding purposes. We use the notion of <b>crackline</b> which represents a rupture in a motion field and we create a non-manifold mesh that allows to estimate the motion in the occlusion areas without degeneration of the triangles. The non-manifold mesh can adequately represent the discontinuities in the motion introduced by moving objects and it improves the motion estimation in the occlusion areas. Results show the better prediction of the texture in those areas, thus improving the coding efficiency. 1...|$|E
40|$|Paul Morand never {{concealed}} {{a certain}} {{nostalgia for the}} Belle Époque and its rituals, its sense of hierarchies, its good manners, faith in progress, {{as well as a}} faith in the superiority of the white race. However, the outbreak of the First World War War not only put an end to that society, but also disclosed deep <b>cracklines</b> in the European spirit, until then considered by Morand, among others, as the repository of reason. Thus Europe and the European people, much like many of Morand’s characters, become clinical cases. Starting form the author’s interest in psychiatry and psychoanalysis during the first war, the article aims to focus on their role in order to illuminate not only some of Morand’s characters, but his whole output...|$|R
