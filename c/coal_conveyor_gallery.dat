50|$|Bold A and B Power Stations were coal fired, with {{a direct}} <b>coal</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt link from a washery at the colliery. This fed either {{directly}} to coal bunkers in both stations or to a stocking area. The extensive rail sidings were utilised for coal delivery, either from Bold Colliery or from other collieries via the main Liverpool to Manchester Lines. The coal from Bold Colliery was deep mined and therefore costly to recover. In later years, due to commercial reasons, the main coal supply became mostly by road from either Yorkshire or Scotland.|$|R
50|$|For {{cogeneration}} Units 1-5, {{in typical}} operation a <b>coal</b> <b>conveyor</b> delivers <b>coal</b> to a scale, {{where it is}} separated into 200-pound batches before being sent to a pulverizer. The coal powder is delivered pneumatically to boilers and burned to heat water in a steam generator. Superheated steam at 900 psi is initially used to drive a turbine/generator, emerging at 90 psi for distribution to campus buildings through a system of tunnels. Steam condensate is returned from campus to the plant via the same tunnels to be cleaned and reused.|$|R

In the mid 1970s the plant was converted back to coal, which fuelled the station until its closure in 1985. By the 1980s production of electricity at South Fremantle had become uneconomical.

The materials examined include wood cribs, transformer fluid, <b>coal,</b> <b>conveyor</b> belting, brattice cloth, and ventilation ducting. Smoke and toxic gases evolved from burning materials contribute to panic conditions and hinder escape. Smoke irritates and obscures vision, while toxic gases physically debilitate and disorient the victims. However, poc emissions may be used for early warning fire detection. POC levels will vary not only between materials but also between stages of combustion and the conditions in which they are burning. This report summarizes the POC characteristics of each material and evaluates their effectiveness for early warning mine fire detection.

40|$|The crane and the {{conveyor}} belt system associated with the coal barge unloading facilities of the former Watts Bar Fossil Plant (WBF) are no longer needed. The crane, if allowed to remain on site, could deteriorate into a safety hazard. For this reason, TVA proposes to remove the crane and either transfer it to another entity for reuse or recycle its component parts. Similarly, the deteriorated <b>coal</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt system is a potential safety hazard, which TVA proposes to disassemble and remove. WBF, because of its age and historical significance to TVA, is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), and the crane and conveyor are components of this historic property. This environmental assessment (EA) assesses the potential impacts of removing the crane and conveyor.

40|$|Abstract. The {{bearing support}} {{breakage}} of screw <b>coal</b> powder <b>conveyor</b> in power plant boiler went through four stages: axial displacement of shaft sleeve, shaft sleeve wearing by shield ring and by bearing, and {{the wearing of}} skeleton seal rings and dustproof felts by shaft sleeve. By analyzing the wearing characters of each part, the renovation structure was designed. The bearing settled style was changed from using shield ring to using locknut by designing convex sidestep on the shaft sleeve, preventing the axial from drifting. Substituting for the welding assembly, the bolt connecting between the covers and the bearing support body was selected to replace the worn sealing materials easily in dismantling and installing. Good operating effects were achieved after the renovation of the <b>coal</b> powder <b>conveyor</b> bearing support, in the screw coal powder manufacturing line of 100 MW power plant boiler, there was no line vibrating, coal leaking, noising and line locking, having decreased the repairing cost greatly and insuring the safety and stable electric power producing...|$|R
