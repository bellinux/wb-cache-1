5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, with wooden pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a small wooden pulpit, which serves as a lectern that is accessible by a small wooden step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped with wooden crown molding. Wooden swag moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and the transom window. The wooden pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's <b>crawl</b> <b>space.</b> Within the <b>crawl</b> <b>space,</b> log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|E

Regional ethnic collections include the Nordic Heritage Museum, the Wing Luke Asian Museum, and the Northwest African American Museum. Seattle has artist-run galleries, including ten-year veteran Soil Art Gallery, and the newer <b>Crawl</b> <b>Space</b> Gallery.|$|E
5|$|Nichols stood trial twice. He {{was first}} tried {{by the federal}} {{government}} in 1997 and found guilty of conspiring to build {{a weapon of mass destruction}} and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter of federal officers. After he was sentenced on June 4, 1998 to life without parole, the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death-penalty conviction on 161counts of first-degree murder (160non-federal agent victims and onefetus). On May 26, 2004 the jury found him guilty on all charges, but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death. Presiding Judge Steven W. Taylor then determined the sentence of 161consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. In March 2005, FBI investigators, acting on a tip, searched a buried <b>crawl</b> <b>space</b> in Nichols' former house and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested.|$|E
40|$|The {{vertical}} edge insulation on foundation walls, {{the popular}} method for structures located in colder regions, {{is expected to}} spread across moderate and humid climate regions because of its insulation superiority in the hygrothermal environments found in <b>crawl</b> <b>spaces.</b> However, {{in the first year}} after completion of buildings, the hygrothermal condition in <b>crawl</b> <b>spaces</b> with insulation foundation wall tends to worsen, leading to condensation and heating load growth. We clarify the factors affecting the hygrothermal behavior in <b>crawl</b> <b>spaces</b> with insulation foundation wall and explore some possible improvements in these hygrothermal environments through simulating simultaneous heat and moisture transfer...|$|R

25|$|Most {{victims were}} buried in Gacy's <b>crawl</b> <b>space,</b> where he would {{periodically}} pour quicklime to hasten the decomposition of the bodies. In January 1979, {{he had planned to}} further conceal the corpses by covering the entire <b>crawl</b> <b>space</b> with concrete. Gacy stated he had lost count of the number of victims buried in his <b>crawl</b> <b>space</b> and had initially considered stowing bodies in his attic before opting to dispose of his victims off the I-55 bridge into the Des Plaines River. Thus the final five victims—all killed in 1978—were disposed of in this manner: because his <b>crawl</b> <b>space</b> was full.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, a 21-year-old Minnesota youth named Russell Nelson disappeared: he {{was last}} seen outside a Chicago bar. Nelson died of {{suffocation}} and was also buried in the <b>crawl</b> <b>space.</b> Less than four weeks later, a 16-year-old Kalamazoo youth named Robert Winch was murdered and buried in the <b>crawl</b> <b>space,</b> and on November 18, a 20-year-old father-of-one named Tommy Boling disappeared after leaving a Chicago bar. Both Winch and Boling were strangled to death and both youths were buried in the <b>crawl</b> <b>space</b> directly beneath the hallway.|$|E

50|$|Genuine infestations are {{far more}} likely in areas with high humidity, such as poorly {{ventilated}} <b>crawl</b> <b>spaces.</b> Housing with central heating/air-conditioning tends to cut the humidity of wood in the living areas to less than half of natural humidity, thus strongly reducing the likelihood of an infestation.

50|$|A {{concrete}} slab {{is a common}} structural element of modern buildings. Horizontal slabs of steel reinforced concrete, typically between 4 and 20 inches (100 and 500 millimeters) thick, are most often used to construct floors and ceilings, while thinner slabs are also used for exterior paving. Sometimes these thinner slabs, ranging from 2 in to 6 in thick, are called mud slabs, particularly when used under the main floor slabs or in <b>crawl</b> <b>spaces.</b>|$|R
50|$|Reflective thermal {{insulation}} {{can be installed}} {{in a variety of}} applications and locations including residential, agricultural, commercial, and industrial structures.

25|$|In ancient times, dogs, often large mastiff- or molosser-type breeds, {{would be}} {{strapped}} with armor or spiked collars and sent into battle {{to attack the}} enemy. This strategy was used by various civilizations, such as the Romans and the Greeks. While not as common as in previous centuries, modern militaries continue to employ dogs in an attack role. SOCOM forces of the US military still use dogs in raids for apprehending fleeing enemies or prisoners, or for searching areas too difficult or dangerous for human soldiers (such as <b>crawl</b> <b>spaces).</b>|$|R

50|$|The Gregangelo Museum {{was dubbed}} {{one of a}} few “home strange homes” by HGTV in 2012, and has been cited in {{interior}} design books, television networks, and entertainment blogs. Mosaic, Egyptian and Middle Eastern themed installations, and paintings are some of the main features of the museum. The Gregangelo Museum generates its revenue by offering tours of the home to the general public. The tour starts outside of the house, and gradually makes its way up onto the second floor. On the second floor is a hidden second half of the museum, which can only be toured through <b>crawl</b> <b>spaces.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike all {{the other}} {{intermediate}} elements in the aforementioned decay chains, radon is, under normal conditions, gaseous and easily inhaled. Radon gas is a health hazard. It is often the single largest contributor to an individual's background radiation dose, but due to local differences in geology, {{the level of the}} radon-gas hazard differs from location to location. Despite its short lifetime, radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings, especially, due to its high density, in low areas such as basements and <b>crawl</b> <b>spaces.</b> Radon can also occur in ground water - for example, in some spring waters and hot springs.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} illustrates {{guidelines for}} the efficient installation of interior duct systems in new housing, including the fur-up chase method, the fur-down chase method, and interior ducts positioned in sealed attics or sealed <b>crawl</b> <b>spaces.</b> This document illustrates {{guidelines for the}} efficient installation of interior duct systems in new housing. Interior ducts result from bringing the duct work inside a home's thermal and air barrier. Architects, designers, builders, and new home buyers should thoroughly investigate any opportunity for energy savings that is as easy to implement during construction, such as the opportunity to construct interior duct work. In addition to enhanced energy efficiency, interior ductwork results in other important advantages, such as improved indoor air quality, increased system durability and increased homeowner comfort. While the advantages of well-designed and constructed interior duct systems are recognized, the implementation of this approach has not gained a significant market acceptance. This guideline describes {{a variety of methods}} to create interior ducts including the fur-up chase method, the fur-down chase method, and interior ducts positioned in sealed attics or sealed <b>crawl</b> <b>spaces.</b> As communication of the intent of an interior duct system, and collaboration on its construction are paramount to success, this guideline details the critical design, planning, construction, inspection, and verification steps that must be taken. Involved in this process are individuals from the design team; sales/marketing team; and mechanical, insulation, plumbing, electrical, framing, drywall and solar contractors...|$|R
