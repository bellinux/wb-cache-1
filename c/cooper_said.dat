When later interviewed by James McDonald, the photographers and another witness confirmed the story. <b>Cooper</b> <b>said</b> military authorities then picked up the film and neither he nor the photographers ever heard what happened to it. The incident was also reported in a few newspapers, such as the Los Angeles Times. The official explanation was that the photographers had filmed a weather balloon distorted by hot desert air.|$|E

In one account, she claimed she was suspended in mid-air and was being assaulted by {{all three of them}} in the bathroom. Cooper then said this event seemed very implausible because of the small size of the bathroom. According to a 60 Minutes investigation, Mangum gave at least a dozen different stories.|$|E

According to Project Vote Smart, he has voted to raise cigarette taxes and for allowing handguns to be carried in state parks.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} {{there were a}} number of minor {{disagreements}} between the French and the other Allies. The British ambassador to France Duff <b>Cooper</b> <b>said</b> that de Gaulle seemed to seek out real or imagined insults to take offence at whatever possible. De Gaulle believed Britain and the US were intending to keep their armies in France after the war and were secretly working to take over its overseas possessions and to prevent it from regaining its political and economic strength. In late October he complained that the Allies were failing to adequately arm and equip the new French army and instructed Bidault to use the French veto at the European Council.|$|E
500|$|David Morrissey portrayed Colonel Brandon. The actor {{was sent}} the script by his agent, and he {{initially}} questioned whether another Austen adaptation was needed. However, he then {{read the script}} {{and thought it was}} [...] "just brilliant", especially as Davies had added more scenes featuring the male characters. Dominic Cooper took on the role of John Willoughby, Brandon's rival for Marianne's affections. Describing his character, <b>Cooper</b> <b>said</b> [...] "The way I tried to persuade myself he wasn't too bad was that he's a 25-year-old young guy and he genuinely falls in love with Marianne – he's not just doing it for one moment in time." [...] <b>Cooper</b> <b>said</b> that he had fun working on the project.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed {{to negative}} reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Tanner Stransky was {{highly critical of}} the episode, describing the Gabrielle story as predictable, the Susan subplot as boring and the overall Bolen story arc as too slow in developing. Stransky also felt the Katherine and Robin pairing was unbelievable, and questioned whether the show's audiences of families and midwesterners would respond well to a lesbian pairing. Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC praised Longoria for turning what he said could have been a gloomy story into [...] "a gleeful fantasy". <b>Cooper</b> <b>said</b> the character was fun and funny but ultimately heartfelt and caring. Conversely, <b>Cooper</b> <b>said</b> the subplots involving the other housewives were [...] "all pretty standard, and dreary, stuff".|$|E
500|$|<b>Cooper</b> <b>said</b> {{the band}} members relied [...] "on each other instead of forcing each other to play something". Guitarist Eddie Reyes insisted on playing his own part, {{as opposed to a}} chord progression, on several occasions. <b>Cooper</b> <b>said</b> [...] "So instead of trying to force him to play one thing, he’ll go and do his own thing that’s way more cool and unique that any of us could imagine." [...] Lazzara {{mentioned}} there was [...] "an urgency and an energy and an excitement" [...] embedded into the material, which [...] "you can't create or fake". Nolan stated that Straylight Run helped Cooper and himself as musicians: [...] "We learned, we grew and were much more mature coming back to TBS." [...] Cooper mentioned that {{towards the end of the}} writing process the group's [...] "creative juices ... were just so depleted".|$|E

Metcalfe went onto tease that things will get [...] "darker" [...] for her character. Mercedes became depressed and her sister Jacqui decided to help her. Mercedes attempted to seduce Jacqui's husband Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss), who told Jacqui. <b>Cooper</b> <b>said</b> Jacqui [...] "knows what state of mind" [...] Mercedes was in and [...] "lays into" [...] Mercedes, who revealed she has been working as a prostitute. Cooper explained Jacqui's reaction is [...] "pretty harsh" [...] and that she thought Mercedes was a [...] "promiscuous tart and a pathetic excuse for a woman" [...] with [...] "no morals". <b>Cooper</b> <b>said</b> Jacqui had [...] "given Mercedes chance after chance, and feels that she doesn't deserve anything more".|$|E

The song was released as the album's second single.|$|R

500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Tanner Stransky criticized [...] "Lovely" [...] for {{stringing}} together several uninteresting and unfunny segments {{rather than}} advancing existing plotlines or introducing new ones. He was particularly {{critical of the}} Susan and Lynette segments, but said the introduction of Katherine's possible lesbianism was [...] "intriguing for the moment". Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC also criticized the episode for failing to advance the plot, and sarcastically wrote of the Katherine development, [...] "Oh, because lesbian storylines have worked so well on this show in the past, except, never." [...] <b>Cooper</b> <b>said</b> the segment involving Robin and Bree {{was the only one}} that didn't feel [...] "stilted and sad".|$|E

[...] A writer for Virgin Media quipped [...] "Wayward teen Toyah rampaged through The Street in the 1990s. She fell for eco-warrior Spider but her life fell apart after she was raped by evil Phil Simmonds. She then followed Spider to London." [...] In November 2012, Paul Millar from Digital Spy stated [...] "Toyah Battersby was one of Coronation Street's best-loved characters – certainly the best-loved Battersby – during the time in which she graced the cobbles." ...|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{introduced}} a fast-paced style of basketball called [...] "Showtime", {{described as a}} mix of [...] "no-look passes off the fastbreak, pin-point alley-oops from halfcourt, spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through triple teams." [...] Fellow Lakers guard Michael <b>Cooper</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "There {{have been times when}} [...] has thrown passes and I wasn't sure where he was going. Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, and I run back up the floor convinced that he must've thrown it through somebody." [...] Johnson could dominate a game without scoring, running the offense and distributing the ball with flair. In the 1982 NBA Finals, he was named the Finals MVP averaging just 16.2 points, the lowest average of any Finals MVP award recipient in the three-point shot era.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{themes are}} about heartbreak and love, {{while most of}} the {{material}} chosen by Charles were ballads as well. The concept which had originally attracted the interest of Charles to this style of music was the strength he admired in writing such a ballad's somber or melancholy lyrics and then performing the ballad beautifully and with emotional stability; an element he had found to be common in even the most diverse musical genres. Writer Daniel <b>Cooper</b> <b>said</b> of Charles's adaptation of country elements, [...] "His country forays play like a series of intricate variations or like one long meditation on the expansive qualities of music commonly described as the white man's blues." [...] Allmusic's Stephen Cook writes that [...] "Charles intones the sleepy-blue nuances of country crooners while still giving the songs a needed kick with his gospel outbursts." ...|$|E
