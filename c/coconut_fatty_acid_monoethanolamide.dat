Microwave and chemical heating is the most widely used method of water in oil demulsification. In this research, the combination of microwave and chemical is used to increase the efficiency of water in oil demulsification. To prevent the environmental issues, natural chemical is used in this research which is Diethanolamide of <b>coconut</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> The effectiveness of microwave assisted natural chemical in demulsification was assessed experimentally with two different power of microwave which are 450 and 600, and two different concentration of Diethanolamide of <b>coconut</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> which are 0. 5 % and 1. 5 %. The water in oil emulsion was prepared by using artificial emulsifier. Artificial emulsifiers used are Triton X- 100, Low Sulphur Wax Residue (LSWR) and Span 83.

Feed intake and body weight were reduced by 14 to 17 % during consumption of experimental diets compared with an unsupplemented starter diet. Following skip-a-day feeding during the growing period, body weights were not different at 140 days of age in each experiment. In Experiment 1, higher egg production (hen-housed %) was associated with glycine-induced restriction of intake of starter diet, {{but there was no}} difference in egg weight. The difference was attributable, in part, to reduced mortality during the early laying period. In Experiment 2, no differences were observed in egg production, grams feed per egg, or egg weight due to glycine- or CFA-induced restriction from 1 to 21 days followed by quantitative restriction. Egg production was lower with a lower level of CFA feed restriction from 22 to 35 days, indicating that restricted feeding prior to 3 5 days increased production of hatching eggs...|$|R

Weanling rats were fed purified diets (casein 20 %, sucrose 70. 5 %, lipid 5 %) for two weeks. The control and magnesium-deficient diets included corn oil as lipid source. The EFA-deficient diet included hydrogenated <b>coconut</b> oil. The <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition of serum lipids confirmed the linoleic acid deprivation in the EFA-deficient group. Significant changes in platelet <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition occurred in this limited period of time and arachidonic acid incorporation into platelet lipids was markedly increased.

40|$|Background The {{increased}} demand for fish protein {{has led to the}} intensification of aquaculture practices which are hampered by nutritional and health factors affecting growth performance. To solve these problems, antibiotics have been used for many years in the prevention, control and treatment against disease as well as growth promoters to improve animal performance. Nowadays, the use of antibiotics in the European Union and other countries has been completely or partially banned {{as a result of the}} existence of antibiotic cross-resistance. Therefore, a number of alternatives, including enzymes, prebiotics, probiotics, phytonutrients and organic acids used alone or in combination have been proposed for the improvement of immunological state, growth performance and production in livestock animals. The aim of the present study was to evaluate two commercially available feed additives, one based on medium-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (MCFAs) from <b>coconut</b> oil and another with a Bacillus-based probiotic, in gilthead sea bream (GSB, Sparus aurata), a marine farmed fish of high value in the Mediterranean aquaculture. Methods The potential benefits of adding two commercial feed additives on fish growth performance and intestinal health were assessed in a 100 -days feeding trial. The experimental diets (D 2 and D 3) were prepared by supplementing a basal diet (D 1) with MCFAs in the form of a sodium salt of <b>coconut</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> distillate (DICOSAN®; Norel, Madrid, Spain), rich on C- 12, added at 0. 3 % (D 2) or with the probiotic Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940, added at 0. 1 % (D 3). The study integrated data on growth performance, blood biochemistry, histology and intestinal gene expression patterns of selected markers of intestinal function and architecture. Results MCFAs in the form of a coconut oil increased feed intake, growth rates and the surface of nutrient absorption, promoting the anabolic action of the somatotropic axis. The probiotic (D 3) induced anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects with changes in circulating cortisol, immunoglobulin M, leukocyte respiratory burst, and mucosal expression levels of cytokines, lymphocyte markers and immunoglobulin T. Discussion MCFA supplementation showed positive effects on GSB growth and intestinal architecture acting mainly in the anterior intestine, where absorption takes place. The probiotic B. amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 exhibited key effects in the regulation of the immune status inducing anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects which can be potentially advantageous upon infection or exposure to other stressors. The potential effects of these feed additives in GSB are very promising to improve health and disease resistance in aquaculture...|$|R

The lipid extract contained less than 0. 12 % free <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> Between 5 and 10 % of the lipid <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were associated with neutral lipids. The majority of the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> {{were associated with the}} complex lipids: mono- and diglucosyl diglyceride, phosphatidyl glycerol, lysyl phosphatidyl glycerol, and cardiolipin. The proportions of the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> changed markedly between bacteria grown anaerobically (no membrane-bound electron transport system) and those grown aerobically (containing a functional electron transport system). In each of the complex lipids, the proportions of the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> as well as the magnitude and direction of change in the molar quantity of the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> per bacterium, changed dramatically between these growth conditions. Since the glucosyl diglycerides and phospholipids were formed from the same pool of diglyceride intermediates, the marked differences in <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> indicate that acyl transferase activities must be an important part of complex lipid metabolism in S. aureus...|$|R
