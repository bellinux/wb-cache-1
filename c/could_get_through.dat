5|$|Despite German {{claims that}} the {{blockage}} did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal {{seemed to have been}} at least partially successful. The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>through.</b> In fact, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had proven optimistic and the channel there had not been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC class had been able to pass through the channel as early as the morning after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to dredge channels around the blockages at both ports over the coming weeks.|$|E
25|$|Grant's final {{attempt was}} to dig another canal from Duckport Landing to Walnut Bayou, aimed at getting lighter boats past Vicksburg. By {{the time the}} canal was almost finished, on April 6, water levels were declining, and none but the lightest of flatboats <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>through.</b> Grant {{abandoned}} this canal and started planning anew.|$|E

Yee, {{received}} a letter from U.S. President Ronald Reagan congratulating him on a worldwide record of 6,131,940 points, a score only possible if he had passed the unbeatable Split-Screen Level. In September 1983, Walter Day, chief scorekeeper at Twin Galaxies, took the US National Video Game Team {{on a tour of the}} East Coast to visit video game players who claimed they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> the Split-Screen Level. No video game player could demonstrate this ability. In 1999, Billy Mitchell offered $100,000 to anyone who could pass through the Split-Screen Level before January 1, 2000. The prize was never claimed.|$|E

25|$|The Provisional IRA {{claimed that}} they had put the bomb on the {{aircraft}} but that {{it had never been}} intended to detonate but to show that they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> the security at Belfast Airport. The way in which the bomb gained access to the aircraft remains unknown. Three police officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary were on board the flight. The Chief Constable of Northern Ireland, James Flanagan together {{with his wife and two}} police officers with their families were travelling to London to attend an investiture; the two officers were to receive the British Empire Medal from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace for their work during the Northern Ireland Troubles. The MP James Molyneaux, Chief Whip for the Ulster Unionist Party and a senior member of the Orange Order was also on the flight. Bob Rae, who would later become Premier of the Canadian province of Ontario and leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, was also a passenger.|$|E

2500|$|According to Métis oral historians, the Métis peoples’ {{long history}} as Hivernants helped with their travels through the Canadian Prairies.

2500|$|Eugene Aksenoff, a Tokyo-based {{physician}} who had treated Jackson {{and his children}} on a few occasions, expressed concern about Jackson's use of and interest in various drugs. Aksenoff said that Jackson asked for stimulants so that he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> some demanding performances. He said he refused to prescribe them. He recalled that the singer suffered chronic fatigue, fever, insomnia and other symptoms and took {{a large amount of}} drugs. He suspected one of the major factors causing Jackson these symptoms was excessive use of steroids or other skin-whitening medications. According to the toxicological tests effectuated on Jackson's body, no addiction had been reported, and none of the experts called to testify at Murray's trial have identified the singer as a drug addict. Janet Jackson confirmed that the Jackson family tried to stage an intervention in early 2007, when Jackson was living in Las Vegas. Janet Jackson and some of her brothers allegedly traveled to his home, but were turned away by security guards who were ordered not to let them in. He was also rumored to have refused calls from his mother. [...] "If you tried to deal with him," [...] one family source said, [...] "he would shut you out. You just wouldn't hear from him for long periods." [...] The family denied that they had tried to intervene.|$|E
2500|$|While Jourdan's army {{withdrew from}} Limburg, Marceau's troops {{provided}} the rearguard, holding {{off the main}} Austrian army long enough to allow the French center and left to reach Altenkirchen. On 18 September, {{most of the day}} was occupied with a general withdrawal took place around Molsberg and Freilingen, where Marceau was ordered to fight a delaying action to give the French left time {{to catch up with the}} center, which had already reached Höhn and Schönberg (a hamlet near Höhn). Marceau remained close to Molsberg for the entire day. [...] When he learned that the main army had started to pass through Altenkirchen, he realized he should begin his own retreat from Molsberg and Freilingen, but he arrived at the northern edge of the Höchstenbach before Grenier's and Championnet's divisions had completely passed through the town Jourdan ordered Marceau to make a stand at Altenkirch so that Grenier's and Championnet's divisions <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> safely. Marceau led the main body of his division back to support the rearguard but, while he was scouting the Austrian positions, he was shot and mortally wounded. [...] Marceau's rattled troops rallied for long enough to prevent the Austrians from breaking the army apart; realizing that the French had escaped him, Charles camped the night at Freilingen. [...] If his goal had been to break apart Jourdan's army, he had nearly succeeded; if it had been to prevent Jourdan from uniting with Moreau, he had succeeded.|$|E
2500|$|Other Texian militias were {{preparing}} to march to the Alamo. In Victoria, Colonel Wharton was preparing to cross the Guadalupe River, while in San Felipe, Captain Mosely Baker ordered the local militia to prepare to march on February 29. Seguin recruited an additional 25 Tejanos, and Dr. Sutherland and Horace Alsbury, husband of Juana Navarro Alsbury, recruited 12 more men and set out on February 28 for Cibolo {{in the hopes of}} meeting Fannin. Meanwhile, Bonham had spoken with Fannin, who again declined to relieve the Alamo. Bonham then went to Gonzales, only to find that most of the men who weren't at the Alamo had gone to the constitutional convention. He did meet nineteen-year-old Ben Highsmith, who had left the Alamo as a courier before Santa Anna's arrival. Highsmith had tried to return to the Alamo but had been chased for [...] by Mexican cavalry; he told Bonham that no one <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> the Mexican lines. Despite the warning, on March 2 Bonham crossed the Guadalupe en route to the Alamo. [...] Unbeknownst to both the Mexican and Texian soldiers, on March 2, delegates to the Convention of 1836 adopted the Texas Declaration of Independence; the Texians were now fighting for the new Republic of Texas. [...] That evening, the Convention finally received Travis's letter of February 25. [...] Shortly thereafter, they received word that Fannin had departed Goliad for the Alamo. [...] Believing that the Alamo would be adequately reinforced, the delegates took no further action.|$|E

2500|$|Less {{than six}} years after his spoof {{obituary}} for English cricket was published, Brooks himself had died in London at the early age of 33. Like his father before him, he was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. He had been suffering from tuberculosis and rheumatism, which had latterly prevented him from working. Obituaries said that his byline on the Sporting Times of Peter Blobbs was known all over the world, {{and in spite of}} his having led a Bohemian lifestyle, [...] "Few men <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> more work in less time, and its quality was invariably good." [...] An obituary in the society magazine Vanity Fair (reprinted in the Sheffield Evening Telegraph) wrote that he had inherited [...] "much of the literary ability of his father" [...] and was [...] "endowed with a keen and very original sense of humour that was entirely his own". Simon Briggs summed him up less charitably as [...] "a stereotypical boozy hack who chased actresses, gambled recklessly and drank himself to an early grave". According to a colleague on the Sporting Times: [...] "Shirley had a sweet and gentle disposition that caused him to be beloved by everybody, nor did any of the petty ironies of life disturb him in the least." [...] Ten years after his death, his former room when visiting the country residence that belonged to John Corlett, the paper's proprietor and editor, was still preserved as he had left it, with his photographs, pictures and sketches adorning the walls.|$|E
