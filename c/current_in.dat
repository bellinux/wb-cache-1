5|$|An {{electric}} <b>current,</b> <b>in</b> {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E

30|$|In {{the sunlit}} {{part of the}} ionosphere, the divergence-free part largely {{corresponds}} to Hall currents, since it resembles reverse convection patterns [see Figs.  3, 4, and the study by Laundal et al. (2016)]. Then the curl-free part will correspond to a true current component, the Pedersen <b>current,</b> which <b>in</b> this case contributes to Birkeland current closure. The westward electrojet will be dominated by Hall <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> sunlight. We therefore interpret the westward electrojet as being maintained by Hall <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> sunlight, and by Birkeland <b>current</b> closure <b>in</b> darkness.

In 1842 he joined the religious-philosophical group, Koło Sprawy Bożej (Circle of God's Cause), led by Andrzej Towiański. This group included, among others, Mickiewicz. Towiański's influence is credited with a new, mystical <b>current</b> <b>in</b> Słowacki's works, seen in works such as the poem Beniowski and the drama Ksiądz Marek (Father Mark).

5|$|In 1879, Edwin Herbert Hall {{working at}} the Johns Hopkins University {{discovered}} a voltage developing across conductors transverse to an electric <b>current</b> <b>in</b> the conductor and magnetic field perpendicular to the current.

After the advent of quantum mechanics, Lev Landau in 1930 developed the theory of landau quantization and laid the foundation for the theoretical explanation for the quantum Hall effect discovered half a century later.|$|E

40|$|Eugenol {{is widely}} used in {{dentistry}} to relieve pain. We have recently demonstrated voltage-gated Na+ and Ca 2 + channels as molecular targets for its analgesic effects, and hypothesized that eugenol acts on P 2 X 3, another pain receptor expressed in trigeminal ganglion (TG), and tested the effects of eugenol by whole-cell patch clamp and Ca 2 + imaging techniques. In the present study, we investigated whether eugenol would modulate 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) -induced <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> rat TG neurons and P 2 X 3 -expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. ATP-induced <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> TG neurons exhibited electrophysiological properties {{similar to those in}} HEK 293 cells, and both ATP- and α,β-meATP-induced <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> TG neurons were effectively blocked by TNP-ATP, suggesting that P 2 X 3 mediates the majority of ATP-induced <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> TG neurons. Eugenol inhibited ATP-induced <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> both capsaicin-sensitive and capsaicin-insensitive TG neurons with similar extent, and most ATP-responsive neurons were IB 4 -positive. Eugenol inhibited not only Ca 2 + transients evoked by α,β-meATP, the selective P 2 X 3 agonist, in capsaicin-insensitive TG neurons, but also ATP-induced <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> P 2 X 3 -expressing HEK 293 cells without co-expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1).
