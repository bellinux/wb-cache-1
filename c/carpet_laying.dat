5000|$|Born in Charleston, West Virginia, Brad Diller is {{the second}} of four kids. After {{his family moved to}} Dallas, Texas for a brief stint while Brad was in junior high school, Diller moved back to Charleston to finish high school, or at least {{something}} equivalent. After earning his GED, Brad moved to Houston, Texas to pursue a career in <b>carpet</b> <b>laying.</b> In 1976, fed up with Texas and upholstery, Diller moved into a flophouse in Daytona Beach, Florida. After two years of what Diller called the [...] "good life," [...] he rejoined society after his mother offered to help him acquire a scholarship to the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. Graduating with his associate degree in 1980, Diller took a job in advertising. After leaving his advertising job, Diller moved immediately into bar tending full-time, which is where he was surrounded in the subject matter that would influence a number of his future comic strips.|$|E
30|$|Satisfaction among TKA {{patients}} has increased, {{with as many}} as 81 – 89  % {{of patients}} being satisfied with their procedure [8, 9]. The areas of greatest satisfaction include functional areas, such as improved knee stability, reduced knee pain experienced after long periods of sitting, and improved abilities to complete basic activities of daily living [8, 9]. In comparison, areas with which patients tend to be least satisfied include pain experienced resulting from the procedure, difficulty in descending stairs and an inability to kneel post TKA [8]. The inability to kneel can be especially problematic for people who engage in activities that regularly require kneeling, e.g., recreational activities such as gardening and playing lawn bowls, and work-related tasks such as <b>carpet</b> <b>laying</b> and plumbing [10 – 12]. In Middle Eastern and Eastern cultures, kneeling is an integral function for everyday tasks, such as praying and sitting for meals [12, 13].|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal Educational Studies in Mathematics [© Springer Science + Business Media B. V. ]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] the last three decades there have been a variety of studies of what {{is often referred to as}} ‘everyday’ or ‘street’ mathematics. These studies have documented a rich variety of arithmetic practices involved in activities such as tailoring, <b>carpet</b> <b>laying,</b> dieting, or grocery shopping. More importantly, these studies have helped to rectify outmoded models of rationality, cognition, and (school) instruction. Despite these important achievements, doubts can be raised about the ways in which theoretical conclusions have been drawn from empirical materials. Furthermore, while these studies rightly criticised prevalent theories of rationality and cognition as too simplistic to account for everyday activities, it seems that some of the proposed alternatives suffer from similar flaws (i. e., are straightforward inversions of the to-beopposed theories, rather than more nuanced views on complicated issues). In this article we illustrate our sceptical view by discussing four case studies in Jean Lave’s pioneering and influential ‘Cognition in Practice’ (1988). By looking at the case studies in detail, we investigate how Lave’s conclusions relate to the empirical materials and offer alternative characterisations. In particular, we question whether the empirical studies demonstrate the existence of two different kinds of mathematics (‘everyday’ and ‘school’, or ‘formal’ and ‘informal’) and whether school instruction tries to replace the former with the latter...|$|E
60|$|The {{church was}} lighted. A {{grosgrain}} <b>carpet</b> <b>lay</b> over the asphalt {{to the edge}} of the sidewalk. Bridesmaids were patting one another's sashes awry and speaking of the Bride's freckles. Coachmen tied white ribbons on their whips and bewailed the space of time between drinks. The minister was musing over his possible fee, essaying conjecture whether it would suffice to purchase a new broadcloth suit for himself and a photograph of Laura Jane Libbey for his wife. Yea, Cupid was in the air.|$|R
60|$|Many {{patterns}} of <b>carpet</b> <b>lay</b> rolled out before {{them on the}} floor--two of Brussels showed {{the beginning of their}} quest, and its ending in that direction; while a score of ingrains lured their eyes and prolonged the debate between desire pocket-book. The head of the department did them the honor of waiting upon them himself--or did Joe the honor, as she well knew, for she had noted the open-mouthed awe of the elevator boy who brought them up. Nor had she been blind to the marked respect shown Joe by the urchins and groups of young fellows on corners, when she walked with him in their own neighborhood down at the west end of the town.|$|R
50|$|In the bored {{suburban}} {{atmosphere of}} a Canadian city, Scott (Scott Speedman) decides {{to throw a}} celebratory get-together with friends in his parents' home. Unfortunately, there's a catch: Scott's parents happen to be particularly anal about the direction the <b>carpet</b> fibers <b>lay</b> and the distance from doily to table-edge. This means that {{the only part of}} the house that is safe, that is, {{the only part of the}} house with no carpeting and therefore no potential mess, is the tiled kitchen.|$|R
6000|$|On {{opening the}} door of Emily's room, Mrs. Wilson found her niece in tears, and her anxiety for her health was alleviated. She knew or hoped, that if she could once call in the {{assistance}} of her judgment and piety to lessen her sorrows, Emily, however she might mourn, would become resigned to her situation; and {{the first step to}} attain this was the exercise of those faculties which had been, as it were, momentarily annihilated. Mrs. Wilson kissed her niece with tenderness, as she placed the letter in her hand, and told her she would call for her answer within an hour. Employment, and the necessity of acting, would, she thought, be the surest means of reviving her energies; nor was she disappointed. When the aunt returned for the expected answer, she was informed by the maid in the ante-chamber, that Miss Moseley was up, and had been writing. On entering, Mrs. Wilson stood a moment in admiration of the picture before her. Emily was on her knees, and by her side, on the <b>carpet,</b> <b>lay</b> the letter and its answer: her face was hid by her hair, and her hands were closed in the fervent grasp of petition. In a minute she rose, and approaching her aunt with an air of profound resignation, but great steadiness, she handed her the letters, her own unsealed: ...|$|R
60|$|They {{were seated}} {{around the table}} in the kitchen of the little Pine Street cottage, making a cold lunch of sandwiches, tamales, and bottled beer. It being Sunday, the four were free from work, and they had come early, to work harder than on any week day, washing walls and windows, {{scrubbing}} floors, <b>laying</b> <b>carpets</b> and linoleum, hanging curtains, setting up the stove, putting the kitchen utensils and dishes away, and placing the furniture.|$|R
50|$|All carpet beetles will {{go through}} {{metamorphism}} during their lives. They will pass through the egg, larval, and pupal points to reach full maturity. This can take two months to many years. Female <b>carpet</b> beetles can <b>lay</b> over 100 eggs which can hatch after 7-35 days. Four generations of carpet beetles can develop every year. It can take 9 months to 2 years for a carpet beetle to become a full adult. However, adults only survive {{for a couple of}} weeks. On the plus side for the beetles, the adults are skillful fliers and can live for many weeks without food.|$|R
60|$|Edward {{finished}} lighting his cigarette, {{then took}} the letter up and glanced at it carelessly. At sight of the first line his expression changed to one of absolute horror, his face blanched, the perspiration sprang out upon his forehead, and the cigarette dropped from his fingers to the <b>carpet,</b> where it <b>lay</b> smouldering. Nor was this wonderful, for the letter was a copy of one of Belle's most passionate epistles to himself. He {{had never been able}} to restrain her from writing these compromising letters. Indeed, this one was the very same that some little time before Mr. Quest had abstracted from the pocket of Mr. Cossey's lounging coat in the room in London.|$|R

The same christening gown in white linen batiste which the prince carried had been worn {{by his father}} in 1906 and would later be worn by his three children. His godparents were the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Denmark (his {{paternal}} uncle and aunt), the Crown Prince of Norway, Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, the King of Sweden (his patrilineal great-grandfather), the Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (his maternal uncle), the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Sweden (his paternal grandfather and step-grandmother), and Count Folke and Countess Maria Bernadotte af Wisborg.|$|R
2500|$|In 1997, Frank Dux, {{the martial}} artist whom Van Damme portrayed in Bloodsport, {{filed a lawsuit}} against Van Damme for $50,000 for co-writing and {{consultation}} work Dux did on the 1996 film The Quest. According to the lawsuit, Dux also accused Van Damme of lying to the public about his martial arts fight record, stating that when Dux tutored Van Damme while Van Damme was <b>laying</b> <b>carpet</b> for a living, Van Damme exhibited a lack of martial arts skills. Van Damme's lawyer, Martin Singer, responded, [...] "There are records to document his martial arts acclaim. Why, just look at his movies; he didn't get those roles on his acting ability! He's the one who does those splits on chairs. He doesn't have a stuntman to do that." ...|$|R
60|$|When we had eaten, the {{treasurer}} reappeared, bearing the Amir's command, {{that we should}} call upon his Wazir, the Gerad Mohammed. Resuming our peregrinations, we entered an abode distinguished by its external streak of chunam, and {{in a small room}} on the ground floor, cleanly white-washed and adorned, like an old English kitchen, with varnished wooden porringers of various sizes, we found a venerable old man whose benevolent countenance belied the reports current about him in Somali-land. [4] Half rising, although his wrinkled brow showed suffering, he seated me by his side upon the <b>carpeted</b> masonry-bench, where <b>lay</b> the implements of his craft, reeds, inkstands and whitewashed boards for paper, politely welcomed me, and gravely stroking his cotton-coloured beard, desired my object in good Arabic.|$|R

5000|$|The second {{assistant}} sound, sound utility technician, or [...] "2nd AS", is {{the assistant}} to the boom operator and is responsible for moving and preparing sound equipment for use around the set while the boom op watches rehearsals and prepares for the next shot, as well as handling wireless audio feeds to the director, script supervisor and producers, and <b>laying</b> <b>carpet</b> and other sound dampening materials in locations with problematic floors or a troublesome acoustic. In addition, the 2nd AS is regularly called upon to operate a second boom in scenes with {{a larger number of}} actors or where actors are physically spaced too far apart for the 1st AS to cover all of the dialogue with one microphone. The 2nd AS also regularly aids in the radio mic'ing of cast when there are a large number of actors in a scene. The term [...] "sound utility technician" [...] is now considered an outdated term by BECTU in the UK and 2nd AS is preferred, with sound utility technician as a role being omitted from recent versions of the rate card. The role is sometimes informally known as a [...] "cable wrangler" [...] or [...] "cable boy".|$|R
500|$|Alabama {{was formed}} by guitarists Randy Owen and Jeff Cook, and bassist Teddy Gentry, three cousins born and raised near Fort Payne, Alabama, an area with strong country music roots. Owen and Gentry grew up on {{separate}} cotton farms on Lookout Mountain (a plateau that stretches across northeastern Alabama, through northwest Georgia and into Tennessee), learning guitar together and singing in church {{before the age of}} six. Gentry and Owen played in numerous groups during the 1960s, ranging from pop [...] Cook joined the band in 1969 forming the group Young Country, which first jammed together around Christmas. Cook also played in numerous bands and was a rock and roll disk jockey. The three cousins all shared vocal duties, with another cousin, drummer Jackie Owen, completing the group's first lineup. The band's first performance was at a high school talent contest (playing a Merle Haggard song), for which they won first prize and tickets to the Grand Ole Opry. Despite this, all were busy with prior commitments to pursue music: Owen still in high school, Cook working for Western Electric, and Gentry <b>laying</b> <b>carpets</b> full-time. The band grew further inactive when Cook went to college and Owen into the military.|$|R
60|$|At that instant, just as I {{took a step}} {{backwards}} {{from the}} telephone, the thing was on us. It was {{as if we were}} bathers, up to our shoulders in water, who suddenly are submerged by a rolling wave. An invisible hand seemed to have quietly closed round my throat and to be gently pressing the life from me. I was conscious of immense oppression upon my chest, great tightness within my head, a loud singing in my ears, and bright flashes before my eyes. I staggered to the balustrades of the stair. At the same moment, rushing and snorting like a wounded buffalo, Challenger dashed past me, a terrible vision, with red-purple face, engorged eyes, and bristling hair. His little wife, insensible to all appearance, was slung over his great shoulder, and he blundered and thundered up the stair, scrambling and tripping, but carrying himself and her through sheer will-force through that mephitic atmosphere to the haven of temporary safety. At the sight of his effort I too rushed up the steps, clambering, falling, clutching at the rail, until I tumbled half senseless upon by face on the upper landing. Lord John's fingers of steel were in the collar of my coat, and a moment later I was stretched upon my back, unable to speak or move, on the boudoir <b>carpet.</b> The woman <b>lay</b> beside me, and Summerlee was bunched in a chair by the window, his head nearly touching his knees. As in a dream I saw Challenger, like a monstrous beetle, crawling slowly across the floor, and a moment later I heard the gentle hissing of the escaping oxygen. Challenger breathed two or three times with enormous gulps, his lungs roaring as he drew in the vital gas.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lotty is nine, {{though she}} looks about six, but {{is as old}} as most girls of fourteen, and takes good care of 'the babies,' as she calls the younger ones. Mrs. Grover went to see them, and, though a {{hard-working}} creature, did all she could for them. This winter she has plenty of time to sew, for Grandpa needs little done for him except at night and morning, and that kind woman spent her own money, and got warm flannel and cotton and stuff, and made each child a good suit. Lotty had come for hers, and when the bundle was in her arms she hugged it close, and put up her little face to kiss Grover so prettily, I felt that I wanted to do something too. So I hunted up Min's old waterproof and rubbers, and a hood, and sent Lotty home as happy as a queen, promising to go and see her. I did go, and there was my work all ready for me. Oh, girls! such a bare, cold room, without a spark of fire, and no food but a pan of bits of pie and bread and meat, not fit for any one to eat, and in the bed, with an old <b>carpet</b> for cover, <b>lay</b> the three children. Tot and Caddy cuddled in the warmest place, while Lotty, with her little blue hands, was trying to patch up some old stockings with bits of cotton. I didn't know how to begin, but Lotty did, and I just took her orders; for that wise little woman told me where to buy a bushel of coal and some kindlings, and milk and meal, and all I wanted. I worked like a beaver for an hour or two, and was so glad I'd been to a cooking-class, for I could make a fire, with Lotty to do the grubby part, and start a nice soup with the cold meat and potatoes, and an onion or so. Soon the room was warm, and full of a nice smell, and out of bed tumbled 'the babies,' to dance round the stove and sniff at the soup, and drink milk like hungry kittens, till I could get bread and butter ready.|$|R
