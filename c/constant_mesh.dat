The export versions with an O prefix for overseas markets, the OPS1, not only had longer wheelbases (where legally applicable) but were equipped with the pre-war design overhead-camshaft E87 engine, which had the same nominal 100bhp output but was larger at 8.6 litres. No UK operator took the OPS1 but Potteries Motor Traction took a batch of long-wheelbase OPD1 Titans as single-deckers, later rebodying them as double decks once overall length rules had been relaxed to allow this. When fitted with left-hand drive, the Tiger became the LOPS1, this prefix attaching to all left-hand drive Leyland buses (and Leyland-designed British United Traction trolleybuses) until the mid-1960s when later designs adopted a suffix letter for driving control position.|$|E

40|$|Linear orderings defined through space-filling curves {{are often}} applied to quickly {{partition}} graphs arising in finite element simulations. In applications with <b>constant</b> <b>meshes</b> but {{a rapidly changing}} load per element, an ordering has to be determined only once and all subsequent partitionings can be computed very quickly through a simple interval splitting. However, partitionings based on space-filling curves have known drawbacks. Especially when applied to deeply refined meshes or discretizations that contain holes, a high edge-cut is produced. In this paper we present a new linear ordering approach called graph-filling curves. In contrast to space-filling curves, we determine a node ordering based on the graph’s structure rather than on its geometric information. Our experimental evaluation shows that such orderings involving the graphs connectivity information lead to clearly superior implicit partitionings...|$|R
