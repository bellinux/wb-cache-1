40|$|One {{crosscutting}} requirement (also called aspect) affects several {{parts of}} a software system. Handling aspects is well understood at source-code level or at runtime. However, only a few aspectoriented approaches handle other software artefact types, like UML models, configuration files, or database schema definitions. Instead of re-writing the same aspect newly for each artefact type, this paper suggests to write down aspects independent of artefact types. But, wait a minute: Where do we weave in an aspect if its pointcut doesn’t refer to artefact details? Which places does such an aspect affect? This paper suggests expressing aspects via Context-Based Constraints (<b>CoCons).</b> They select their constrained system elements according to the element’s context. For instance, <b>CoCons</b> affect all system elements used in a certain department, workflow, or location. <b>CoCons</b> are easy to grasp for users and customers because they express business requirements without referring to technical details. This paper focuses on how to express crosscutting requirements in UML models via <b>CoCons</b> and compares <b>CoCons</b> to the Object Constraint Language OCL...|$|R

40|$|One {{crosscutting}} requirement (also called aspect) affects several {{parts of}} a software system. It is difficult to express aspects during requirements analysis or at design level if we don’t know all implementation details yet. For instance, {{it is difficult to}} determine at which places (= join points) which aspect must be added to (= weaved in) the system. In this paper, we suggest to express aspects in a way that is under-standable for stakeholders and customers. We achieve this by using a new notion of weaving: We determine where to weave in which aspect by considering the system’s context – our pointcuts are context-based. We express aspects via Context-Based Constraints (<b>CoCons)</b> independent of pro-gramming or modelling languages. 1...|$|R

Pottery-making at Ban Mai goes through following manufacturing processes. "① Gathering clay suitable for pottery. ② Kneading and tempering the clay with sand of laterite. ③ First stage of forming. Clay is formed into cylinder. ④ Second stage of forming. The upper part of pot is formed using the paddle andanvil.

40|$|We {{often fail}} {{to keep track of}} {{requirements}} in complex software systems because we cannot cope with all the details- in particular, it is expensive to check a system for compliance with crosscutting requirements where one requirement affects several parts of the system. In order to detect requirement violations, each system element involved in a requirement must be identified and checked for whether it meets the requirement. But, it is difficult to identify which system element is involved in which requirement in complex or frequently changing software systems. In this thesis, I specify crosscutting requirements via constraints in order to automatically check the system for compliance and to automatically identify contradicting requirements. I present a new notion of constraints: a context-based constraint (<b>CoCon)</b> expresses a condition on how its constrained elements must relate to each other.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this article}} is to {{describe}} conditions of abortions practices in France. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was based on the <b>COCON</b> survey. This survey was carried out among a representative sample of 2863 women aged 18 to 44 living in metropolitan France. Women were interviewed by telephone. The analysis was performed among a sub-sample of 320 women who had had an abortion between 1996 and 2000. Results were compared with those of the national notification of induced abortions. RESULTS: Altogether, the way in which abortions were carried out was appropriate, but differences were observed according to the type of hospital: access to care was easier in the private sector; however a pre-abortion interview was less often carried out and a post-abortion interview less often proposed in the private sector. Besides, in both sectors, women were rarely allowed to choose the abortion technique, or the type of anesthesia in the case of a surgical abortion. CONCLUSION: The <b>COCON</b> study is the first population based survey describing the characteristics of care regarding voluntary abortion. It shows the persistence of differences in practices between the public and the private sectors...|$|E

The participants in this project were the building society "Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall", the Technical University Berlin and Fraunhofer Institute for Software an d Systems Engineering (ISST). The sub-project Conceptual Base presents a general model of software evolution developed at the TU-Berlin and a description language "ComponentML" to specify components designed by Fraunhofer ISST. For the general model of software evolution, the context-based constraint (<b>CoCon)</b> has been developed. Using <b>CoCon,</b> components can be enriched with context information and constraints can be formulated for various context information. ComponentML supports the evolution of component-based systems using a platform-independent XML-representation of the components and their relations. In the sub-project Corporate Finance, the Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall and the Fraunhofer ISST dealt with tree main points: 1. Architecture of components: Broad research was done in the field of components for corporate finance:viewpoints, reference models, types of components and business entities, requirements for concrete finance components, specification of finance components, implementation with modern technologies, integration of legacy systems. 2.

40|$|Abstract. Software {{evolution}} {{is a major}} challenge to software development. When adapting a component-based system to new, altered or deleted requirements, existing requirements should not accidentally be violated. Invariant conditions are usually specified via constraint languages like OCL on a high precision level close to source code. On the contrary, this paper uses a new constraint mechanism. One context-based constraint (<b>CoCon)</b> specifies one requirement {{for a group of}} indirectly associated components that share a context. This paper proposes a ‘Rule Manager ’ approach to monitor a system’s compliance with requirements automatically at runtime.

Distribution requirements are expressed via a new notion of constraints: a context-based constraint (<b>CoCon)</b> can indirectly select its constrained elements according to their context. The context of an element characterizes {{the situation in which}} this element resides and is annotated via metadata.
