5000|$|<b>Cheese</b> <b>curing,</b> {{alternatively}} Tushar or Bengali, is {{a process}} in cheesemaking. It {{is responsible for the}} distinct flavour of cheese, and through the modification of [...] "ripening agents", determines the features that define many different varieties of cheeses, such as taste, texture, and body. [...] The process is [...] "characterized by a series of complex physical, chemical and microbiological changes" [...] that incorporates the agents of: [...] "bacteria and enzymes of the milk, lactic culture, rennet, lipases, added moulds or yeasts, and environmental contaminants." [...] The majority of cheese is ripened, save for [...] cheese.|$|E

A self-taught cook, who idolised Elizabeth David, she was {{determined}} to show that making great food does not depend on buying expensive ingredients or having special expertise. This was followed by the Pauper’s Homemaking Book in 1976 which took the same democratic approach to interiors and Country Kitchen which reinvented a lost world of rural British cookery and crafts - Damson <b>Cheese,</b> <b>curing</b> hams in saltpetre and parsnip wine.|$|E
50|$|Cheese {{is another}} product made from milk. Whole milk is reacted to form curds {{that can be}} compressed, {{processed}} and stored to form cheese. In countries where milk is legally allowed to be processed without pasteurization, {{a wide range of}} cheeses can be made using the bacteria naturally in the milk. In most other countries, the range of cheeses is smaller and the use of artificial <b>cheese</b> <b>curing</b> is greater. Whey is also the byproduct of this process. Some people with lactose intolerance are surprisingly able to eat certain types of cheese. This is because some traditionally made hard cheeses, and soft ripened cheeses may create less reaction than the equivalent amount of milk because of the processes involved. Fermentation and higher fat content contribute to lesser amounts of lactose. Traditionally made Emmental or Cheddar might contain 10% of the lactose found in whole milk. In addition, the aging methods of traditional cheeses (sometimes over two years) reduce their lactose content to practically nothing. Commercial cheeses, however, are often manufactured by processes that {{do not have the same}} lactose-reducing properties. Ageing of some cheeses is governed by regulations; in other cases there is no quantitative indication of degree of ageing and concomitant lactose reduction, and lactose content is not usually indicated on labels.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Numerous {{attempts}} have been made to identify the flavor compounds in Blue cheese, however, duplication of Blue cheese flavor has not yet been accomplished. Therefore, it was desirable to make a qualitative and quantitative investigation of Blue cheese flavor compounds and to study the effect of certain microorganisms on Blue cheese flavor. The aroma fraction of Blue cheese was isolated by centrifugation of the cheese and molecular distillation of the recovered fat. The volatiles were separated by gas chromatography on packed columns containing polar and nonpolar phases and by temperature programmed capillary column gas chromatography. Relative retention time data and fast scan mass spectral analysis of the capillary column effluent were used to identify compounds in the aroma fraction. Compounds positively identified were as follows: 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -heptanone, 2 -octanone, 2 -nonanone, 2 -decanone, 2 -undecanone, 2 -tridecanone, 2 -propanol, 2 -pentanol, 2 -heptanol, 2 -octanol, 2 -nonanol, methyl butanoate, methyl hexanote, methyl octanoate, methyl decanoate, methyl dodecanoate, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, ethanal, 3 -methyl butanal, 2 -methyl butanol, 3 -methyl butanol, 1 -pentanol, benzene, and toluene. Tentatively identified compounds included acetone, delta-octalactone, delta-decalactone, methyl acetate, isopropyl hexanoate, 3 -methylbutyl butanoate, pentyl hexanoate, ethyl- 2 -methylnonanoate, isopropyl decanoate, furfural, 2 -methyl propanal, methanol, ethanol, 2 -phenylethanol, cresyl methyl ether, dimethylcyclohexane, diacetyl, methyl mercaptan, and hydrogen sulfide. A combination of liquid-liquid column chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography was utilized to quantitate the major free fatty acids in Blue and Roquefort cheese samples. The average concentration (mg acid/kg cheese) in three Blue cheese samples was as follows: 2 : 0, 826; 4 : 0, 1, 448; 6 : 0, 909; 8 : 0, 771; 10 : 0, 1, 318; 12 : 0, 1, 588; 14 : 0, 5, 856; 16 : 0, 12, 789; 18 : 0, 4, 243; 18 : 1, 12, 455; 18 : 2, 1, 072; 18 : 3, 987. Roquefort cheese was found to be proportionately more abundant in 8 : 0 and 10 : 0 acids and low in 4 : 0 acid compared to Blue cheese. No formic, propionic, or isovaleric acid was detected in any of the cheeses tested. A quantitative procedure involving adsorption chromatography, liquid-liquid chromatography and absorption spectrophotometry was used to isolate and measure the concentration of the C₃, C₅, C₇, C₉, and C₁₁ methyl ketones in the fat of Blue and Roquefort cheese. The average methyl ketone concentration (micromoles ketone/ 10 g cheese fat) of five Blue cheese samples was as follows: acetone, 1. 7; 2 -pentanone, 5. 9; 2 -heptanone, 11. 2; 2 -nonanone, 9. 3; 2 -undecanone, 2. 4. Considerable variation in ketone concentration was noted between samples, but no consistent differences were observed between Blue and Roquefort cheese. One Roquefort sample contained no acetone. The annount of ketone formed during <b>cheese</b> <b>curing</b> does not depend directly on the amount of available fatty acid precursor. There appears to be a selective conversion of the 8 : 0, and to a lesser extent the 6 : 0 and 10 : 0, fatty acids to methyl ketones by the Penicillium roqueforti spores. The concentration of the C₅, C₇, and C₉ secondary alcohols was determined in the same cheeses used for ketone analysis. The previously measured ketones acted as internal standards and facilitated a semi-quantitative calculation of alcohol concentrations from peak areas of gas chrorriatograms. The average alcohol concentration (micromoles alcohol/ 10 g cheese fat) in five Blue cheese samples was as follows: 2 -pentanol, 0. 3; 2 -heptanol, 2. 1; 2 -nonanol, 0. 8. The alcohols were present in approximately the same ratios as their methyl ketone analogs, but at much lower concentrations. A synthetic Blue cheese flavor was prepared using a blend of butterfat, dry curd cottage cheese, cream, and salt as a base. The most typical flavor was obtained using the following' compounds: the 2 : 0, 4 : 0, 6 : 0, and 8 : 0 fatty acids at two-thirds the average concentration found in cheese; twice the average concentration of the C₃, C₅, C₇, C₉, and C₁₁ methyl ketones and C₅, C₇, and C₉ secondary alcohols found in cheese: 2. 0 mg/kg of base of 2 -phenylethanol; 1. 5 mg/kg of base of ethyl butanoate; 6. 0 mg/kg of base of both methyl hexanoate and methyl octanoate. Incorporation of higher acids caused a soapy flavor. The presence of 2 -phenylethanol and the esters was judged as very important in duplicating Blue cheese flavor. The mycelia of Penicillium roqueforti appear to be more active in the reduction of methyl ketones to secondary alcohols than the spores. Yeasts associated with Blue cheese are capable of reducing methyl ketones to secondary alcohols. Yeasts also may play a role in Blue cheese flavor by producing ethanol and other alcohols and certain esters...|$|E

25|$|MAOIs {{tend to have}} {{pronounced}} (sometimes fatal) {{interactions with}} a wide variety of medications and over-the-counter drugs. If taken with foods that contain very high levels of tyramine (e.g., mature <b>cheese,</b> <b>cured</b> meats, or yeast extracts), they may cause a potentially lethal hypertensive crisis. At lower doses the person may be bothered by only a headache due to an increase in blood pressure.|$|R
2500|$|Peanut butter's flavor {{combines}} {{well with}} other flavors, such as oatmeal, <b>cheese,</b> <b>cured</b> meats, savory sauces, and {{various types of}} breads and crackers.

Today the main product is goat cheese, although certain amounts are made from sheep's or cow's milk, and according to the Registro General Sanitario de Alimentos, the general health registry, around 75 different cottage cheeses are produced. The cheeses of the Canaries have generally received good international reviews, noted for their sweetness which differentiates them from certain other European cheeses.

40|$|Resources (tangible and intangible) can be mobilised to {{increase}} region’s reputation and confer {{a competitive advantage}} to certain products with origin in that region. The returns of a region’s resources depend upon the ability of local firms to appropriate the rents earned and whether the consumers value {{the characteristics of the}} region that are associated with the product, being disposed to pay a price premium. The estimation of a hedonic price function, which relates the price of portuguese regional cheeses to its various attributes, provided empirical support to the hypothesis that regional designation of origin maters to consumers. The study shows that some designations of origin, <b>cheese</b> characteristics (<b>cured</b> or not) and milk types {{have a significant impact on}} price.

50|$|For <b>cured</b> <b>cheese</b> {{the milk}} is curdled at 30-34°C (86-93°F) for 40-60 minutes.

40|$|In cattle, the MC 1 R gene {{has been}} the subject of several studies with the aim to {{elucidate}} the biology of coat colour. Then, polymorphisms of this gene have been proposed as tools for breed identification and animal products authentication. As a first step to identify breed specific DNA markers that can be used for the traceability of mono-breed dairy cattle products we investigated, using PCR-RFLP and PCR-APLP protocols, the presence and distribution of some alleles at the MC 1 R locus in 18 cattle breeds for a total of 1360 animals. For each of seven breeds (Italian Holstein, Italian Brown, Italian Simmental, Rendena, Jersey, Reggiana and Modenese) a large number of animals (> 70) was genotyped so the obtained results can be considered with more confidence. Allele ED was identified only in black pied cattle (Italian Holstein and Black Pied Valdostana). Allele E (this nomenclature includes all alleles except ED, E 1 and e) was observed in Italian Brown, Rendena, Jersey, Modenese, Italian Simmental, Grigio Alpina, Piedmontese, Chianina, Romagnola, Marchigiana, Swedish Red and White and Danish Red. Allele E 1 was identified in Italian Brown, Rendena, Grigio Alpina, Piedmontese, Swedish Red and White and Danish Red. The recessive allele e, known to cause red coat colour, was fixed in Reggiana and almost fixed in Italian Simmental. This allele was observed also in Italian Holstein, Italian Brown, Rendena, Jersey and Modenese albeit with low frequency. Moreover, this allele was detected in Valdostana, Pezzata Rossa d’Oropa, Piedmontese, Romagnola, Swedish Red and White, Danish Red, Charoleis and Salers. In the case of the Reggiana breed, which is fixed for allele e, the MC 1 R locus is highly informative with respect to breeds that carry other alleles or in which allele e is at very low frequency. In theory, using the MC 1 R locus it is possible to identify the presence of milk from some other breeds in Parmigiano Reggiano cheese labelled as exclusively from the Reggiana breed. This possibility was practically tested by setting up protocols to extract and analyse polymorphisms of the MC 1 R locus in several dairy products, including Parmigiano Reggiano <b>cheese</b> <b>cured</b> for 30 months.
