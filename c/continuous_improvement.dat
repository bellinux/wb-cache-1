These occur approximately every eighteen months: {{the first and third}} are ten-week-long 'intermediate dockings', and the second, or 'mid-cycle docking', lasts sixteen weeks. At the end of six years, each boat comes in for her 'full cycle docking', which involves completely refurbishing the submarine.

40|$|In today's {{society we}} are all {{strongly}} dependent on correct functions of technical systems. These systems tend to increase in both complexity and criticality, {{at the same time}} as they often have a rather long life. During this long life the stakeholders' requirements on the functions of the systems change. In order to maintain a high level of stakeholder satisfaction organisations responsible for the system have to respond to the changes through system development and <b>continuous</b> <b>improvements.</b> When the technical system is both complex and critical it is even more important that the work with <b>continuous</b> <b>improvements</b> is done in a systemic and systematic way. This is because a modification may result in unwanted side effects and a small change in one part of the system may have a major negative impact on many other parts of the system, and also have far reaching decisive consequences. The purpose of this thesis is to explore and describe how an organisation can work with <b>continuous</b> <b>improvements</b> of complex technical system functions in the context of changing stakeholder requirements, in order to increase stakeholder satisfaction with a reduced amount of resources. To fulfil the stated purpose a case study supported by a literature study has been made. The case study focused on a modern combat aircraft, which is considered as a highly complex and safety critical system with stringent requirements on low life cycle cost. The result of the study may be described in two parts. The first part is a theoretical management framework that combines aspects of Quality Management, Requirements Management, and Health Management. The framework describes on a conceptual level how the work with <b>continuous</b> <b>improvements</b> may be enhanced through synergism achieved by the combination. The second part, which is based on both theoretical and empirical findings, is a model intended to support the work with <b>continuous</b> <b>improvements.</b> The model includes a number of combined and adapted methodologies and tools that enable traceability between stakeholder requirements and the critical system functions that should be covered by tools that support Condition Monitoring, Diagnostics, and Prognostics...|$|R

25|$|BPR is {{different}} from other approaches to organization development (OD), especially the <b>continuous</b> <b>improvement</b> or TQM movement, {{by virtue of its}} aim for fundamental and radical change rather than iterative improvement. In order to achieve the major improvements BPR is seeking for, the change of structural organizational variables, and other ways of managing and performing work is often considered insufficient. For being able to reap the achievable benefits fully, the use of information technology (IT) is conceived as a major contributing factor. While IT traditionally has been used for supporting the existing business functions, i.e. it was used for increasing organizational efficiency, it now plays a role as enabler of new organizational forms, and patterns of collaboration within and between organizations.|$|E

One underlying reason for this restructuring is issues with consistency within the organization. The purpose of this thesis is to bring forth potential countermeasures to enhance consistency, and further aims to provide insights in how to establish a culture, and the tools necessary for a steady foundation, in which <b>continuous</b> <b>improvements</b> can prosper, and thus prevent the need for {{major changes in the}} future. The findings indicate that Akademiska Hus has great potential to reach further in the area of <b>continuous</b> <b>improvements</b> as they already possess vital elements required for higher levels. However, further efforts in including a larger portion of the organization in the innovation process is needed. This could be done by implementing a reward and recognition system, and by strategically aligning every-day tasks with the overall organizational targets. A key to do so is to implement a well-structured performance measurement system to monitor and steer the direction of improvements. Such system can further contribute to a greater understanding of organizational targets amongst employees by identifying, and communicating strategically important areas. This thesis further investigates potential contributions partnering can bring to the organization in the area of <b>continuous</b> <b>improvements.</b> Partnering is essentially a contracting form with the aim to enhance collaboration between actors in the construction sector. The study identifies several benefits partnering can bring with it. Close collaboration can enable better communication and create mutually agreed goals and visions for the project organization. Further are the possible trade-offs between actors, such as the ability to share resources and solutions perceived as potential contributors to increase overall <b>continuous</b> <b>improvements.</b> The thesis conclude by recommending the implementation of an adequate performance measurement system to enable monitoring of the actual impact partnering brings with it compared to traditional contracting forms...|$|R
