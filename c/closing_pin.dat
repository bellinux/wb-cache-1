50|$|Because the <b>closing</b> <b>pin</b> {{is seen by}} many skydivers as a {{life-saving}} {{piece of}} equipment, {{it has become a}} symbol of the sport for those who have experienced only one tandem jump and also for those who have hundreds and thousands of jumps. The <b>closing</b> <b>pin</b> is often worn as a piece of jewelry on necklaces and bracelets. It is also a popular tattoo among skydivers. Used as a fashion accessory, the <b>closing</b> <b>pin</b> serves as a symbol - allowing skydivers to recognize one another and their mutual love of the sport.|$|E
50|$|A <b>closing</b> <b>pin</b> is {{a curved}} piece of {{stainless}} steel metal used in the sport of skydiving. The pin is sewn onto the bridle which is a 7 to 10-foot long piece of nylon webbing connected to the pilot chute. The <b>closing</b> <b>pin</b> passes through the closing loop and in doing so, secures the main container of a skydiving rig, keeping the parachute from deploying prematurely. When the pilot chute is thrown out by the skydiver and catches air, it pulls the <b>closing</b> <b>pin</b> from the closing loop and allows the main parachute {{to be released from}} the container and inflate.|$|E
50|$|With the {{pull-out}} system, {{the pilot}} chute is packed inside the container. The activation handle {{is attached to}} a lanyard, which in turn is attached to the <b>closing</b> <b>pin.</b> The lanyard is also attached to base of the pilot chute, at the point of connection to the bridle. When the user pulls the handle, the <b>closing</b> <b>pin</b> is pulled, opening the container. Continuing the pull, the user pulls the pilot chute out of the container and into the airstream, at which point the pilot chute inflates and pulls the main parachute out of the container.|$|E
50|$|EZ {{through the}} gate: Place 5 pins in a row, with each pin 5 cm {{away from the}} next <b>closest</b> <b>pin.</b> Fire from 60 cm away for 10 rounds. Each B-Dama passes between gap scores 10 points, while each pin knocked down loses 10 points.|$|R
50|$|Any pin {{knocked over}} is worth one point but {{if only the}} central pin is knocked over, two points are won. After having thrown three balls, the player passes over to the zona de birle. They are then allowed to bowl the three balls again from where they fell in the first throw, a move called birlar. If a ball comes to rest very <b>close</b> to two <b>pins,</b> a special move called segar in which the player knocks over the <b>close</b> <b>pins</b> while aiming for others.|$|R
40|$|Immobilization in cast {{has been}} {{standard}} treatment for un displaced supracondylar fracture of humerus. Closed reduction and percutaneous pinning {{provides the best}} cosmetic and functional results. The fracture can be fixed with pinning in any desired position. Use of medial and lateral pin fixation provides more s tability. The pins must continue into the opposite cortex to provide good fixation. Smooth pins are preferred and restoration of movements is full range with <b>closed</b> <b>pinning</b> than open reductio...|$|R
50|$|Reserve parachutes {{usually have}} a ripcord {{deployment}} system, which was first designed by Theodore Moscicki, but most modern main parachutes used by sports parachutists use a form of hand-deployed pilot chute. A ripcord system pulls a <b>closing</b> <b>pin</b> (sometimes multiple pins), which releases a spring-loaded pilot chute, and opens the container; the pilot chute is then propelled into the air stream by its spring, then uses the force generated by passing air to extract a deployment bag containing the parachute canopy, {{to which it is}} attached via a bridle. A hand-deployed pilot chute, once thrown into the air stream, pulls a <b>closing</b> <b>pin</b> on the pilot chute bridle to open the container, then the same force extracts the deployment bag. There are variations on hand-deployed pilot chutes, but the system described is the more common throw-out system.|$|E
50|$|A ripcord {{is a part}} of a skydiving harness-container system; {{a handle}} {{attached}} to a steel cable ending in a <b>closing</b> <b>pin.</b> The pin keeps the container closed and keeps the spring-loaded pilot chute inside. When the ripcord is pulled, the container is opened and the pilot chute is released, opening the parachute. On tandem systems the ripcord releases the 3-ring release system anchoring the bridle to the harness-container, allowing the parachute to open.|$|E
50|$|The {{throw-out}} {{pilot chute}} {{is the most}} popular type in use today. The pilot chute is packed in a pouch {{at the bottom of the}} container (often called BOC for short). The handle is attached to the apex of the pilot chute. When the user grabs the handle and throws the pilot chute into the airstream, the bridle extends, pulling the <b>closing</b> <b>pin</b> and opening the container, as the pilot chute continues in the airstream it extracts the deployment bag containing the main parachute from the container. The pull-out pilot chute and the throw-out pilot chute were both invented by Bill Booth.|$|E

40|$|Background There is {{controversy}} about the appropriate treatment for severely displaced and unstable comminuted fracture of distal radius (type C of AO or OTA classification). Recently, {{there has been}} {{an increase in the number}} of predilection for surgical management of this fracture. Aim To determine the radiographic outcome in type C fractures of the distal radius treated with <b>closed</b> reduction and <b>pin</b> in plaster. Materials and Methods Eighty consecutive patients 60 male and 20 female, average age 40 years (22 – 60 years), with type C fractures of the distal radius seen between February 2001 and July 2003 in Shahid Kamiab Hospital of Mashad University, were treated by <b>closed</b> reduction and <b>pin</b> in plaster, followed up by anteroposterior and lateral radiographs to evaluate radial height, inclination and volar tilt. Results There was significant improvement in the measurements of radial height, inclination and volar tilt after <b>closed</b> reduction and <b>pin</b> in plaster, and at the time the pins and plaster were removed. (P = 0. 00). Conclusion <b>Closed</b> reduction and <b>pin</b> in plaster is an effective, simple and low cost method in type C fractures of distal radius with satisfactory outcome...|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "horseshoe" [...] {{describes}} a malfunction where a parachute deploys, but remains {{attached to a}} skydiver by its risers {{and at least one}} other point. This prevents the canopy from opening properly and the canopy and lines form a horseshoe shape extending from the risers up and then back down again to the other point where the parachute remains attached to or entangled with the skydiver. This malfunction may occur when the <b>closing</b> <b>pin</b> of a skydiving rig is released from the closing loop and allows the deployment bag to separate from the container. Because the pilot chute is still stowed, the malfunction takes on the shape of a horseshoe. This malfunction may also occur if the pilot chute or bridle connecting the pilot chute to the canopy becomes entangled with the skydiver. It is possible, though rare, to experience this type of malfunction when one or more parachute lines entangle with or snag on some portion of the parachute rig.|$|E

50|$|The Merck stitch {{method is}} a {{minimally}} invasive procedure for pinning protruding ears, developed by Merck. The method belongs to the special types of ear pinning surgeries. In contrast to other variations of {{minimally invasive procedure}}s the stitch method does not use additional techniques from the traditional ear pinning surgeries (otoplasty). It belongs to the <b>closed</b> ear <b>pinning</b> surgeries because the ear is not cut open for {{the placement of the}} sutures. According to the experience of the author the Stitch Method is suitable for all protruding ears. The stitch method is the most frequently performed otoplasty among the minimally invasive methods.|$|R
50|$|Bacon {{is often}} used in cooking filet mignon because of the low levels of fat found in the cut (see barding), as fillets have low levels of marbling, or {{intramuscular}} fat.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To biomechanically {{test the}} {{properties}} of three different Universal Micro External Fixator (UMEX™) configurations {{with regard to their}} use in very small animals (< 5 kg) and compare the UMEX system to the widely used IMEX External Skeletal Fixation (SK™) system in terms of stiffness, space needed for pin placement and weight. METHODS Three different UMEX configurations (type Ia, type Ib, and type II modified) and one SK configuration type Ia were used to stabilize Delrin plastic rods in a 1 cm fracture gap model. These constructs were tested in axial compression, craniocaudal bending, mediolateral bending, and torsion. Testing was conducted within the elastic range and mean stiffness in each mode was determined from the slope of the linear portion of the load-deformation curve. A Kruskal Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks test was utilized to assess differences between constructs (p < 0. 05). RESULTS The UMEX type II modified configuration was significantly stiffer than the other UMEX configurations and the SK type Ia, except in craniocaudal bending, where the SK type Ia configuration was stiffer than all UMEX constructs. The UMEX type Ia configuration was significantly the weakest of those frames. The UMEX constructs were lighter and smaller than the SK, thus facilitating <b>closer</b> <b>pin</b> placement. CONCLUSIONS Results supported previous reports concerning the superiority of more complex constructs regarding stiffness. The UMEX system appears to be a valid alternative for the treatment of long-bone fractures in very small animals...|$|R

50|$|On the {{day that}} an option expires—for U.S. {{exchange}} traded equity options this is the Saturday following the third Friday of the month—if an option's underlier is <b>close</b> to <b>pinning,</b> the trader must pay close attention. A small movement of the underlier's price through the strike (e.g. from below the strike price to above, or vice versa) can have a large impact on the trader's net position in the underlier on the trading day after expiration. For instance, if an option goes from being in the money to out of the money, the trader must rapidly trade enough of the underlier so that the position after expiration will be flat.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTI ON: In the {{literature}} {{the best results}} for pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures have been achieved by closed reduction and wire fixation.

40|$|Silicide Schottky {{contacts}} can be {{as large}} as 0. 955 eV (E{sub v} + 0. 165 eV) on n-type silicon and as large as 1. 05 eV (E{sub c} {minus} 0. 07 eV) on p-type silicon. Current models of Schottky barrier formation do not provide a satisfactory explanation of occurrence of this wide variation. A model for understanding Schottky contacts via screened pinning at defect levels is presented. In the present paper it is shown that most transition metal silicides are pinned approximately 0. 48 eV above the valence band by interstitial Si clusters.
