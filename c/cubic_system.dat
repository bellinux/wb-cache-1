500|$|Contrary to {{most other}} lanthanides, {{which have a}} {{close-packed}} hexagonal lattice, ytterbium crystallizes in the face-centered <b>cubic</b> <b>system.</b> Ytterbium has a density of 6.973g/cm3, which is significantly {{lower than those of}} the neighboring lanthanides, thulium (9.32g/cm3) and lutetium (9.841g/cm3). Its melting and boiling points are also significantly lower than those of thulium and lutetium. This is due to the closed-shell electron configuration of ytterbium ( [...] 4f14 6s2), which causes only the two 6s electrons to be available for metallic bonding (in contrast to the other lanthanides where three electrons are available) and increases ytterbium's metallic radius.|$|E

In Chapter 1, we briefly recall the basic concepts of differential equations and the history of Hilbert's 16 th problem. In Chapter 2, we describe multiparameter vectors, their bifurcations and rotated vector fields. In Chapter 3, we introduce parameter continuation methods and applications to multiparameter vectors. In Chapter 4, we summarize recent studies of quadratic systems and address the most used methods, including the uniqueness theorems and classifications of Hopf bifurcations. In Chapter 5, we mention examples of <b>cubic</b> <b>systems</b> having eleven limit cycles and the <b>cubic</b> <b>systems</b> of Lienard type. In Chapter 6, we apply parameter-continuation method to compute the limit cycle bifurcation diagram for quadratic systems of special interest, whose limit cycles can not be determined with the techniques of qualitative theory. Our computations support the assumption that quadratic systems have at most four limit cycles. In Chapter 7, parameter-continuation methods are applied to investigate some Lienard <b>cubic</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
