50|$|The {{definitions}} of creative economy and <b>creative</b> <b>industry</b> were not brand new concepts.

Professor Galloway at the University of Glasgow stated in his paper that the British government used the terms of <b>creative</b> <b>industry</b> and cultural industry confusingly in the enforcement of the creative economy policy. In 2012, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan, as well as the Nomura Research Institute, redefined <b>creative</b> <b>industry</b> as “an industry that is composed of product, business, talent, etc., which are selected in a market through the added value of creativity rather than price.” The Japanese government suggested that the <b>creative</b> <b>industry</b> may differ based on the policy and competitiveness of the related industry by adding three new fields, such as advertisement, art, and design, to the six fields that were proposed in the Cool Japan Strategy, which was the strategy to promote the <b>creative</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|R
