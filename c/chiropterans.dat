25|$|Under {{the care}} of her adoptive family, Saya Otonashi had been living {{the life of an}} anemic amnesiac, but {{otherwise}} ordinary schoolgirl. However, her happy life is shattered when she is attacked by a Chiropteran, a hematophagous bat-like creature that lives by feeding on human blood. Saya learns that she {{is the only one who}} can defeat them, as her blood causes their bodies to crystallize and shatter. Armed with her special katana, Saya embarks on a journey with her family, allies, and her chevalier Haji, to rid the world of the Chiropteran threat and recover her identity. The course of the journey reveals the background history of the <b>Chiropterans</b> and Saya's past, which extends into the mid-19th century.|$|E
5000|$|The promotional {{video for}} [...] "Aozora no Namida" [...] was {{directed}} by AT, and, like her previous two, was filmed at an unknown location. The PV starts off with the main character of Blood+, Saya Otonashi, preparing to fight a <b>Chiropteran.</b> The scene suddenly changes to Hitomi waking up on a staircase, looking around, and then walking down the staircase. The scene changes again to Saya killing the <b>Chiropteran,</b> the scene also constantly switching from Hitomi to this scene as Hitomi continues to [...] "search" [...] around the place. As the PV progresses, Hitomi stumbles upon Saya fighting another <b>Chiropteran,</b> with Saya losing control of her sword. Also, other scenes of Hitomi can be seen; Hitomi sitting on a bunch of rocks with steam around her, and Hitomi singing in a subway-like setting (this is also where {{the fight against the}} second <b>Chiropteran</b> takes place). Hitomi grabs the sword and kills the <b>Chiropteran</b> causing Saya to disappear with a smile. The end of the PV features Hitomi walking out onto a cliff to view a city being ravaged by more Chiroptera, her eyes glowing red.|$|R

40|$|Only {{one species}} of bat, Molossus molossus, {{previously}} {{has been documented}} as occurring on the northern Lesser Antillean island of Nevis. Field research and reviews of existing museum collections have provided documentation based on voucher specimens for an additional seven species occurring on the island — Noctilio leporinus, Brachyphylla cavernarum, Monophyllus plethodon, Ardops nichollsi, Artibeus jamaicensis, Natalus stramineus, and Tadarida brasiliensis. The biological diversity of the <b>chiropteran</b> fauna on Nevis {{is similar to that}} found on other islands in the northern Lesser Antilles. Ecologically, this is a simple <b>chiropteran</b> fauna, including one piscivore (N. leporinus), one omnivore (B. cavernarum), one pollenivore/nectivore (M. plethodon), two frugivores (A. nichollsi, A. jamaicensis), and three insectivorous species (N. stramineus, T. brasiliensis, M. molossus). Species-area and species-elevation analyses for the <b>chiropteran</b> fauna of the Greater and Lesser Antillean islands gave r 2 -values of 0. 74 and 0. 33, respectively. Tn the species-area analysis the bat fauna of Nevis falls above the regression line and in the species-elevation analysis it falls almost on the line. The <b>chiropteran</b> fauna of Nevis lies outside the Lesser Antillean Faunal Core and would be best characterized as a generalized Lesser Antillean fauna that appears to be characteristic of the northern Lesser Antilles...|$|R

50|$|At the school, Saya {{runs into}} a meek nurse, Makiho Amano, {{on the eve}} of the school's annual Halloween party. Two of Saya's classmates, Sharon and Linda, make a visit to Makiho at the nurse's office. Suddenly, Saya bursts into the room, killing Linda and {{wounding}} Sharon, breaking her sword in the process. Both girls are revealed to be <b>chiropterans.</b> Makiho goes into shock at the revelation. Meanwhile, a third chiropteran reveals itself and begins making its way to the base. Back at the school, Makiho regains her nerve and pursues Sharon into a room full of dancing Americans in costume, where she finds Sharon transformed. Saya saves her and both flee into a nearby motor pool. The <b>chiropterans</b> trap them inside and attack.|$|E

However, it's revealed that all evidence of the battle between Saya and the <b>chiropterans</b> has been covered up and both David and Saya have disappeared, leaving Makiho with nothing to prove the veracity of her story. Her interviewer then asks her to identify Saya in a picture which has a girl that looks identical to her, except the picture was taken in 1892. The only other description of the picture is the word [...] "VAMPIRE".

40|$|The <b>chiropteran</b> fauna of Barbados {{includes}} {{representatives of}} four families — Noctilionidae, Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae, and Molossidae — including 1 piscivore (Noctilio leporinus), 1 omnivore (Brachyphylla cavernarum), 1 pollenivore/nectarivore (Monophyllus plethodon), 1 frugivore (Artibeus jamaicensis), and 2 insectivorous species (Myotis nyctor and Molossus molossus).

The Barbadian <b>chiropteran</b> fauna of 6 species is much smaller than those on the four neighboring Lesser Antillean islands to the west and north. We believe that this is primarily the result of two factors—geological age and geographic isolation. Our work indicates that populations of the 6 species of bats on Barbados are in good condition in all cases, but only for Artibeus jamaicensis and Molossus molossus are the populations large enough to not be of ongoing concern. The maintenance of the <b>chiropteran</b> fauna can best be served by three management actions — preservation of caves and associated gullies, forests, and hydrological systems...|$|R

40|$|Lyssaviruses are unsegmented RNA viruses causing rabies. Their vectors {{belong to}} the Carnivora and Chiroptera orders. We studied 36 carnivoran and 17 <b>chiropteran</b> lyssaviruses {{representing}} the main genotypes and variants. We compared their genes encoding the surface glycoprotein, {{which is responsible for}} receptor recognition and membrane fusion. The glycoprotein is the main protecting antigen and bears virulence determinants. Point mutation is the main force in lyssavirus evolution, as Sawyer's test and phylogenetic analysis showed no evidence of recombination. Tests of neutrality indicated a neutral model of evolution, also supported by globally high ratios of synonymous substitutions (dS) to nonsynonymous substitutions (dN) (> 7). Relative-rate tests suggested similar rates of evolution for all lyssavirus lineages. Therefore, the absence of recombination and similar evolutionary rates make phylogeny-based conclusions reliable. Phylogenetic reconstruction strongly supported the hypothesis that host switching occurred in the history of lyssaviruses. Indeed, lyssaviruses evolved in chiropters long before the emergence of carnivoran rabies, very likely following spillovers from bats. Using dated isolates, the average rate of evolution was estimated to be roughly 4. 3 × 10 − 4 dS/site/year. Consequently, the emergence of carnivoran rabies from <b>chiropteran</b> lyssaviruses was determined to have occurred 888 to 1, 459 years ago. Glycoprotein segments accumulating more dN than dS were distinctly detected in carnivoran and <b>chiropteran</b> lyssaviruses. They {{may have contributed to the}} adaptation of the virus to the two distinct mammal orders. In carnivoran lyssaviruses they overlapped the main antigenic sites, II and III, whereas in <b>chiropteran</b> lyssaviruses they were located in regions of unknown functions...|$|R
40|$|Five {{species of}} bats {{are known to}} occur on the Lesser Antillean island of Barbuda—Noctilio leporinus, Monophyllus plethodon, Brachyphylla cavernarum, Tadarida brasiliensis, and Molossus molossus. During the present study, two {{additional}} species of bats—Artibeus jamaicensis and Natalus stramineus—were added to the <b>chiropteran</b> fauna of the island. Although the ecological diversity of Barbuda is limited, this bat fauna matches those of islands in the region such as Antigua, Nevis, and St. Kitts. It is proposed that this biodiversity of bats is maintained because of the geology of Barbuda provides ample roosting sites and access to freshwater in caves, bluff faces, and sinkholes. The conservation of the <b>chiropteran</b> fauna of Barbuda, therefore, depends on the protection of these geological resources...|$|R
40|$|Surveys on the <b>chiropteran</b> {{diversity}} {{were conducted}} at eight different localities in Sarawak {{to document the}} bat diversity {{as well as to}} estimate the composition of bats in these areas.

Disturbed habitats do pose a threat to the overall diversity of bats, with the generalist bats been more successful in colonising altered area than those with specialised habitat requirements. Sampling of bats targeted at different site and vegetation type from several protected areas in Sarawak have revealed the current record of bats in Sarawak and its diversity can be monitored for better management of biodiversity in this important region...|$|R

5000|$|Chiroptera (<b>chiropterans</b> or, as {{spoken in}} the film, chiropterates), from the Greek for [...] "hand wings" [...] ( [...] in Japanese), are hematophagous bat-like creatures, {{comparable}} to humans in intelligence. They disguise themselves as people and can gradually transform, becoming large, monstrous, and long-limbed.

It brings Saya to the year 2002, with {{a new generation of}} handlers and continuing her quest to destroy <b>chiropterans.</b> Appropriately named Blood: The Last Vampire 2000 (Buraddo Za Rasuto Vanpaia 2000), the single-volume title was published in Japan by Kadokawa Shoten on May 1, 2001. It was licensed and released in English in North America by Viz Media under the title Blood: The Last Vampire 2002 on November 5, 2002. In the manga, David has retired and Saya has a new handler who makes it abundantly clear that he has no respect for her. He sends her to Jinkōsen Shūritsu Valley High School under the name of [...] "Saya Otonashi". There, she learns that <b>chiropterans</b> co-existed with humans, until humans began experimenting on them in the 19th century to try to gain immortality. The experiments increased the chiropterans' killing instinct and removed their former regard for humanity. Scientists, in turn, developed twin anti-chiropteran weapons. Maya, a prototype, still required blood and could transform like other chiropteran. The second, Saya, did not need to drink blood and had no transformation abilities so she was considered the perfected weapon. Maya searches for Saya, desiring to have Saya eat her so they can become one pure-blood chiropteran. After this meeting, Maya's body cannot be found, but it is never shown if Saya granted her request. Saya kills her handler and walks off into the night.|$|E
