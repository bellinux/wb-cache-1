50|$|The King's first {{landmark}} project {{after his}} formal coronation was launching the National <b>Cadastral</b> <b>Resurvey</b> in March 2009, aimed at resolving long-standing land issues of excess land that affects every Bhutanese household. A variation of land reform focuses on improving {{the lives of}} people living in remote and difficult areas, with the Rehabilitation Project. The pilot Rehabilitation Project at Khinadang in Pemagatshel was initiated in 2011, and inaugurated by Prince Jigme Dorji Wangchuck in October 2014. The Project resettled people living in the more inaccessible areas of the country to the village, and provided them with basic amenities and services, as well as support in agriculture. The project saw tremendous success, and similar projects are in the pipeline in other parts of Bhutan.|$|E
40|$|A Land Administration System (LAS) {{with its}} {{cadastral}} component is the infrastructure that facilitates {{the implementation of}} land policies to attain sustainable development. Therefore, {{the availability of a}} digital, up-to-date and easily accessible cadastral database has become a primary requirement for undertaking efficient land administration and/or spatial planning decisions for any country. In this paper, the authors demonstrate a method for constructing a seamless digital cadastral database (DCDB) based on colonial cadastral maps using Geographic Information System (GIS) and image interpretation techniques for an area of about 326 km 2. Geo-Eye 1 (pan-sharpened) data were used for this purpose in combination with limited on-site survey. The proposed approach could be considered as an alternative to a complete <b>cadastral</b> <b>resurvey.</b> It is important to mention here that the quality of these colonial maps is quite high and can be proven as a basis for spatial planning. A <b>cadastral</b> <b>resurvey</b> may be required in the future where there is an urgent need for higher accuracy, but the approach would be time consuming and potentially bring unrest in villages and urban neighbourhoods. Hence, an alternative is, therefore, to respect the contents of the existing maps and records combined with a quality upgrade: make the existing records and maps up-to-date as a basis for a spatial planning.

40|$|For the {{cadastral}} management advancement, South Korea has upgraded {{its system}} through digitization of cadastral map. Recently, {{due to the}} computerization of the cadastral management system, various work systems have been developed and operate in cadastral fields for cadastral book information services, cadastral map information services, and real estate services. Especially brand-new information systems have been developed {{as part of a}} <b>cadastral</b> <b>resurvey</b> project. Although the operation of diversified systems has no problem in independent work areas, the inefficiency of operation such as data non-coincidence and compatibility issues between system databases has been incurred in mutual utilization and provision of cadastral information. In order to resolve these issues, this study suggests an integration model design strategy of cadastral information systems...|$|E

We used detailed surface mapping, differential analysis of pre- and postearthquake light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and property boundary (<b>cadastral)</b> <b>resurveying</b> to produce high-resolution (centimeter-scale) estimates of coseismic ground-surface displacements across the Waterford releasing bend. Our results indicate that the change in orientation on the Greendale fault incorporates elements of a large-scale releasing bend (from the viewpoint of westward motion {{on the south side of}} the fault) as well as a smaller-scale restraining stepover (from the viewpoint of southeastward motion on the north side of the fault). These factors result in the Waterford releasing bend exhibiting a decrease in displacement to near zero at the change in strike, and the presence within the overall releasing bend of a nested, localized restraining stepover with contractional bulging. The exceptional detail of surface deformation and kinematics obtained from this contemporary surface-rupture event illustrates the value of multimethod investigations. Our data provide insights into strike-slip fault bend kinematics, and into the potentially subtle but important structures that may be present at bends on historic and prehistoric rupture traces...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{the mobile}} {{cadastral}} surveying {{system is to}} integrate RTK-GPS surveying, electric plane table (Total Station + Pen computer + Software) surveying, high capacity wireless modem, control point database, and cadastral map database into one system, {{making it possible to}} automate cadastral surveying processes. The system could be also applied for various areas of surveying such as <b>cadastral</b> <b>resurvey</b> project and Location Based Service (LBS). The mobile vehicle surveying system is composed of one set of RTK-GPS equipment, RF Modem, WHIP antenna, YAGI antenna, AC&DC Power Supply, 19 inch LCD monitor, electric plane table, a wireless telegraph for both car and users and a four-wheel-drive vehicle. The mobile surveying system is fitted with various RTK equipment so that it could minimize troublesomeness of connecting equipment and obtain mobility to enhance efficiency of surveying. As the cadastral map computerization project is completed, a new method of cadastral surveying is introduced by utilizing the electric file of cadastral map in this paper.

40|$|Advancements in {{satellite}} sensor technology enabling capturing of geometrically accurate images of earth’s surface coupled with DGPS/ETS and GIS technology holds {{the capability of}} large scale mapping of land resources at cadastral level. High Resolution Satellite Images depict field bunds distinctly. Thus plot parcels are to be delineated from cloud free ortho-images and obscured/difficult areas are to be surveyed using DGPS and ETS. The vector datasets thus derived through RS/DGPS/ETS survey are to be integrated in GIS environment to generate the base cadastral vector datasets for further settlement/title confirmation activities. The objective {{of this paper is}} to illustrate the efficacy of a hybrid methodology employed in Pitambarpur Sasana village under Digapahandi Tahasil of Ganjam district, as a pilot project, particularly in Odisha scenario where the land parcel size is very small. One of the significant observations of the study is matching of Cadastral map area i. e. 315. 454 Acres, the image map area i. e. 314. 887 Acres and RoR area i. e. 313. 815 Acre. It was revealed that 79 % of plots derived by high-tech survey method show acceptable level of accuracy despite the fact that the mode of area measurement by ground and automated method has significant variability. The variations are more in case of Government lands, Temple/Trust lands, Common Property Resources and plots near to river/nalas etc. The study indicates that the adopted technology can be extended to other districts and <b>cadastral</b> <b>resurvey</b> and updating work can be done for larger areas of the country using this methodology...|$|E
