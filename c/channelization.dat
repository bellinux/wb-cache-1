5|$|The Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{has had a}} {{long history}} of water pollution, which can be attributed to residential development. While no raw sewage flows into the creek, the creek is contaminated by large quantities of urban runoff from impervious paved surfaces that collects toxins before pouring untreated into the creek. There are over four large storm drain outlets that pour directly into Sulphur Creek. Such untreated runoff has caused E. coli and Enterovirus to increasingly harm the creek and its remaining biodiversity. <b>Channelization</b> is also another factor, and standing water in the Sulphur Creek Reservoir has suffered eutrophication. The primary source of bacteria contamination is the largest tributary of Sulphur Creek, now mostly underground. The channel joins the creek not too far from its mouth. It has been proved that 87 percent of the Sulphur Creek mainstem is severely degraded.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} on the Santa Ana River for at least 9,000 years. In the period {{immediately}} before and during European colonization, there were four distinct indigenous groups in the area. The river was first seen by Europeans in 1769, when it received its name {{from members of the}} Spanish Portola expedition. Because {{it was one of the}} only reliable sources of water in a wide region, many large ranchos developed along the river and one of its major tributaries, Santiago Creek. After the area became part of the United States, the economy transitioned to agriculture, before urbanizing in the 20th century. Many cities established during this time including Santa Ana, Riverside and Anaheim derived their names from the river. In order to protect urban areas from the river's flood threat, major <b>channelization</b> and damming projects were undertaken in the 20th century, resulting in the loss of much of the natural river channel.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the upper}} tributaries of Shamokin Creek are in the Western Middle Anthracite Coalfield and {{nearly all of the}} streams {{in this part of the}} {{watershed}} are impacted by mining, except for Furnace Run. Various mine drainage sites occur in the watersheds of all other streams in the upper Shamokin Creek watershed. None of the tributaries in the lower reaches of the Shamokin Creek watershed are affected by mining. Four tributaries of Shamokin CreekLick Creek, Millers Run, Bennys Run, and Trout Runare not designated as impaired waterbodies by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Another five tributariesNorth Branch Shamokin Creek, Locust Creek, Quaker Run, Coal Run, and Carbon Run are impaired by metals due to abandoned mine drainage. Furnace Run is impaired by <b>channelization</b> and habitat alteration, while Little Shamokin Creek and its tributary Plum Creek are impaired by siltation, organic enrichment, and low levels of dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The Nassers and Naify {{contracted}} with Pflueger in early 1926 to build three large movie theaters in central California cities. They assigned Pflueger {{the design of}} the Tulare Theatre (1927) in Tulare, the Senator Theatre (1928) in Chico and the State Theatre (1928) in Oroville. The $250,000 Tulare Theatre (now demolished) featured motifs based on the Ishtar Gate of Babylon. Pflueger included zigzag patterns in the twin-towered facade trimmed in neon accents, and brought Streamline Moderne stylings to the interior via sweeping curves in steel banister railings as well as Mayan touches in the stepped mirrors. The $250,000 State Theatre appeared Spanish Colonial with its tiled roof and concrete bas-relief exterior, but turned to Streamline Moderne in a 1,529-seat interior that featured chrome railings, plush carpet and indirect lighting. Aztec elements were incorporated in the proscenium design. The $300,000 Senator Theatre was delayed in construction by the discovery of running water under the foundation, a condition that required <b>channelization</b> and pumps. The movie palace's eclectic theme was largely Egyptian with Moorish, Asian and Aztec details dominated by a landmark tower topped by a giant faceted amber glass gem lit from within.|$|E
25|$|Stream <b>channelization</b> is {{the process}} of {{engineering}} straighter, wider, and deeper stream channels, usually for improved navigation, wetland drainage, and/or faster transport of flood waters downstream. Levees are often constructed in conjunction with <b>channelization</b> to protect human development and agricultural fields from flooding. Riparian vegetation can be directly removed or damaged during and after the <b>channelization</b> process. In addition, <b>channelization</b> and levee construction modify the natural hydrology of a stream system. As water flows through a natural stream, meanders are created when faster flowing water erodes outer banks and slower flowing water deposits sediment on inner banks. Many riparian plant species depend on these areas of new sediment deposition for germination and establishment of seedlings. Channel straightening and levee construction eliminate these areas of deposition, creating unfavorable conditions for riparian vegetation recruitment.|$|E
25|$|More anthropocentric geobiologic events {{include the}} origin of animals and the {{establishment}} of terrestrial plant life, which affected continental erosion and nutrient cycling, and likely changed the types of rivers observed, allowing <b>channelization</b> of what were previously predominantly braided rivers.|$|E
25|$|Stream {{channels}} {{will often}} recover from <b>channelization</b> without human intervention, provided that humans do {{not continue to}} maintain or modify the channel. Gradually, channel beds and stream banks will begin to accumulate sediment, meanders will form, and woody vegetation will take hold, stabilizing the banks. However, this process may take decades: a study found stream channel regeneration took approximately 65 years in channelized streams in West Tennessee. More active methods of restoration may speed the process along.|$|E
25|$|<b>Channelization</b> and {{landfilling}} {{began in}} the colonial era and continued well into the 20th century. Early materials were shellfish and other refuse, and later construction debris from projects such as the New York City Subway and Pennsylvania Station. Rubble from the bombing of London was transported for ballast during World War II. New land has been created throughout the port, including large swaths that are now Battery Park City, Ellis Island, Liberty State Park, Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, and the Meadowlands Sports Complex.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1950, the Bogotá River meandered {{through the}} middle of the basin with wide {{riparian}} areas, extensive flood plains, and thriving ecosystmes such as the La Conejera, Juan Amarillo, and Jaboque wetlands. Rapid urbanization has resulted in the <b>channelization</b> of the river, destruction of wetlands and settlements along the river making the river increasingly prone to flooding. In response, CAR has incorporated a flood works program to widen and protect riparian zones, restore the natural meander of the river, and hydraulically connect the river to its flood plains. In one particular component of a World Bank loan (see Multi-stakeholder assistance below) to CAR, EAAB, and the District Government; the Flood Control and Environmental Works project finances a comprehensive river recuperation program that incorporates best practice in urban river restoration. This component consists of improving flood control from an existing 10-25-year return period to a 100-year period, restoring part of the river flood plain, creating and enhancing wetlands and multifunctional parks, and complementing wastewater infrastructure with existing wastewater treatment when possible.|$|E

500|$|The {{route and}} the {{environmental}} characteristics of Missouri River in the northern Great Plains states of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, and Montana have been significantly altered. The resultant changes to the Missouri River in the upper Great Plains from <b>channelization</b> and impoundment prevent upstream migration. The reduced water flow rates and sediment loads have brought {{an end to the}} seasonal flooding of the flood plains in the region. Since the construction of the Fort Peck Dam in Montana in 1937, and subsequent damming and <b>channelization,</b> the Missouri River has lost over 90% of its wetland and sandbar ecosystems. More than [...] of the Missouri River have been altered and only that stretch of the river above Fort Peck Reservoir in Montana remains relatively unchanged. These alterations of the river have had a detrimental impact on a number of native fish species. In the 13 U.S. states where the pallid sturgeon is found, only a few other fish species are listed as endangered. Although substantial efforts are being implemented to ensure the survival of this species, the rarity of self-sustaining populations of pallid sturgeon ensures that it will remain federally protected for many decades.|$|E
500|$|The {{course of}} Abrahams Creek has been altered by flood control projects. There is a {{sediment}} retention structure on the creek {{at the lower}} end of [...] "The Hollow". Large portions of the creek, especially in its lower reaches, have undergone full stream <b>channelization,</b> with the stream channel being hardened by concrete or rock. In West Wyoming, a nearly mile-long stretch is lined with concrete. In the early 20th century, part of the creek above The Hollow had grouted stone walls, which were completed in the 1930s.|$|E

500|$|Historic {{accounts}} {{suggest that}} San Juan Creek provided habitat for steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) in many historic accounts. However, pollution and competition from introduced sport fishes such as bluegill and striped bass have extirpated steelhead in the creek. Bacteria levels in San Juan Creek exceed state standards by 93 percent. The loss of riparian habitat along the lower [...] of San Juan Creek {{and much of}} Trabuco and Oso Creeks due to <b>channelization</b> has also reduced steelhead habitat. However, in 2003 the California Department of Fish and Game reported three sightings of steelhead in , immediately downstream of a drop structure that channels the creek beneath Interstate 5. In response, the Department of Fish and Game lobbied Caltrans to build a fish ladder at the structure, {{but it has not}} yet been implemented, due to concerns about structural stability of the I-5 bridge and the presence of a nearby natural gas pipeline.|$|E
500|$|American {{paddlefish}} {{populations have}} declined dramatically, {{primarily as a}} result of overfishing and habitat destruction. [...] In 2004 they were listed as Vulnerable (VU A3de ver 3.1) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. [...] They are currently proposed for listing as VU 3de throughout their range {{as the result of a}} U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service assessment. [...] The assessment concluded that [...] "an overall population size reduction of at least 30% may occur within the next 10 years or three generations due to actual or potential levels of exploitation and the effects of introduced taxa, pollutants, competitors or parasites." [...] American paddlefish are filter-feeding pelagic fish that require large, free-flowing rivers with braided channels, backwater areas, oxbow lakes that are rich in zooplankton, and gravel bars for spawning. [...] Series of dams on rivers such as those constructed on the Missouri River have impounded large populations of American paddlefish, and blocked their upstream migration to spawning shoals. <b>Channelization</b> and groynes or wing dykes have caused the narrowing of rivers and altered flow, destroying crucial spawning and nursery habitat. [...] As a result, most impounded populations are not self-sustaining and must be stocked to maintain a viable sport fishery.|$|E
2500|$|In preindustrial times, {{the winding}} river was some 24 miles (about 40km) from the Saint Louis {{to the start}} of the portage. Prior to the <b>channelization</b> of the river {{described}} above, Muskeg Lake, several miles to the south of the start of the portage, was considered to be the source. [...] In truth, both Wolf and Muskeg Lakes were open areas of water in the same enormous and impassable marsh then known as the [...] "Great Savannah", and travellers took the portage to avoid the worst part of this marsh. [...] With the <b>channelization</b> of the river, Muskeg Lake is no longer open water, and the actual distance from the start of the portage to the river's outlet is only , as the meanders have been substantially eliminated.|$|E

2500|$|Although some {{river channel}} work {{was already in}} place at the time, the 1938 flood was the main impetus for channelizing the Los Angeles River in concrete, {{speeding}} the flow of floodwaters to the sea.

About [...] of streams in the Los Angeles River system were encased in concrete, a huge undertaking that took twenty years to complete. The system successfully protected Los Angeles from massive flooding in 1969. The San Gabriel and Santa Ana Rivers were also ultimately channelized to protect against future floods, although it took much longer for those projects to be completed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{negative}} effects of <b>channelization</b> on stream and riparian health can be lessened through physical restoration of the stream channel. [...] This {{can be accomplished by}} restoring flow to historic channels, or through the creation of new channels. In order for restoration to be successful, particularly for the creation of entirely new channels, restoration plans must take into account the geomorphic potential of the individual stream and tailor restoration methods accordingly. This is typically done through examination of reference streams (physically and ecologically similar streams in stable, natural condition) and by methods of stream classification based on morphological features. Stream channels are typically designed to be narrow enough to overflow into the floodplain on a 1.5 to 2 year timescale. The goal of geomorphic restoration is to eventually restore hydrologic processes important to riparian and instream ecosystems. However, this type of restoration can be logistically difficult: in many cases, the initial straightening or modification of the channel has resulted in humans encroaching into the former floodplain through development, agriculture, etc. In addition, stream channel modification can be extremely costly.|$|E
