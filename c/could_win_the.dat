5|$|The Premier League {{maintains}} two trophies – {{the genuine}} trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica. Two trophies {{are held in}} the event that two different clubs <b>could</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> League {{on the final day of}} the season. In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season – then a replica won by a previous club is used.|$|E
5|$|In November 1644 Rupert was {{appointed}} General {{of the entire}} Royalist army, which increased already marked tensions between him {{and a number of}} the King's councillors. By May 1645, and now desperately short of supplies, Rupert captured Leicester, but suffered a severe reversal at the Battle of Naseby a month later. Although Rupert had counselled the King against accepting battle at Naseby, the opinions of Digby had won the day in council: nonetheless, Rupert's defeat damaged him, rather than Digby, politically. After Naseby, Rupert regarded the Royalist cause as lost, and urged Charles to conclude a peace with Parliament. Charles, still supported by an optimistic Digby, believed he <b>could</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> war. By late summer Rupert had become trapped in Bristol by Parliamentary forces; faced with an impossible military situation on the ground, Rupert surrendered Bristol in September 1645, and Charles dismissed him from his service and command.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Challenge era come from the method of play of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada prior to 1893. From 1887 to 1893, the league did not play a {{round-robin}} format, but rather challenges between teams of the association that year, with {{the winner of the}} series being the 'interim' champion, with the final challenge winner becoming the league champion for the year. The Stanley Cup kept the tradition going, but added league championships as another way that a team <b>could</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> trophy. If a team in the same league as the current champion won the league championship, it would then inherit the Cup, without a challenge. The only time this rule was not followed was in 1904, when the Ottawa Senators club withdrew from its league, the CAHL. The trustees ruled that the Cup stayed with Ottawa, instead of the CAHL league champion.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{began their}} League Cup {{campaign}} in the third round, drawn at home to Newcastle United. They made nine changes from the previous starting XI – Eduardo paired up with Bendtner in the front two. Bendtner scored the opening goal seven minutes {{from the end of}} normal time; Denílson added a second goal to ensure Arsenal's progression. Fourth-round opponents Sheffield United were easier to defeat, with Eduardo scoring a brace (two goals). The quarter-final pitted Arsenal away to Blackburn Rovers, in a match played on 18 December 2007. Diaby gave Arsenal the lead with a volley after six minutes and Eduardo extended the lead, before Roque Santa Cruz pulled a goal back for Blackburn, three minutes {{from the end of the}} first half. Santa Cruz scored the equaliser and his second of the match, heading in a cross by David Bentley. In stoppage time, Denílson was sent off for a two-footed challenge on Dunn. In spite of playing with one less player, Arsenal regained the lead. Alex Song passed the ball to Eduardo, who held off his opponent Ryan Nelsen and with minimal effort placed it past Brad Friedel. The performance prompted Wenger to assert that his team <b>could</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> cup, while opposing manager Mark Hughes commented that Arsenal's blend of young players were capable of following in the footsteps of Manchester United's fledglings, managed by Alex Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} race, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the Drivers' Championship with 88 points, ahead of Mika Häkkinen on 80 points and David Coulthard on 63. Rubens Barrichello was fourth on 55 points, with Ralf Schumacher fifth on 24 points. A maximum of 20 points were {{available}} for the final two races, which meant Häkkinen could still win the title. Michael Schumacher only needed to clinch victory in the race, regardless of where Häkkinen finished, Schumacher {{would be more than}} ten points ahead of Häkkinen with one race remaining. Otherwise, Häkkinen <b>could</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> Championship in the final race of the season in Malaysia by out-scoring his rival. In the event of a points tie, Michael Schumacher would win the Championship on count-back, having more wins. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari were leading on 143 points, McLaren and Williams were second and third on 133 and 34 points respectively, while Benetton with 20 and Jordan with 17 contended for fourth place. Championship drivers Barrichello and Giancarlo Fisichella had each gained second-place finishes while Ralf Schumacher and Heinz-Harald Frentzen had both achieved third place podium finishes.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, {{the owner}} and {{the driver of the}} chariot were {{different}} persons. In 416 BC, the Athenian general Alcibiades had seven chariots in the race, and came in first, second, and fourth; obviously, he could not have been racing all seven chariots himself. Philip II of Macedon also won an Olympic chariot race in an attempt to prove he was not a barbarian, although if he had driven the chariot himself he would likely have been considered even lower than a barbarian. The poet Pindar did praise the courage of Herodotes of Thebes, however, for driving his own chariot. This rule also meant that women <b>could</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> race through ownership, despite the fact that women were not allowed to participate in or even watch the Games. This happened rarely, but a notable example is the Spartan Cynisca, daughter of Archidamus II, who won the chariot race twice. Chariot racing was a way for Greeks to demonstrate their prosperity at the games. The case of Alcibiades indicates also that chariot racing was an alternative route to public exposure and fame for the wealthy.|$|E
