60|$|Besides these moral hindrances, {{mechanical}} {{difficulties are}} often an insuperable impediment to forms of government. In the ancient world, though there might be, and often was, great individual or local independence, {{there could be}} nothing like a regulated popular government {{beyond the bounds of}} a single city-community; because there did not exist the physical conditions for the formation and propagation of a public opinion, except among those who could be brought together to discuss public matters in the same agora. This obstacle is generally thought to have ceased by the adoption of the representative system. But to surmount it <b>completely,</b> required the <b>press,</b> and even the newspaper press, the real equivalent, though not in all respects an adequate one, of the Pnyx and the Forum. There have been states of society in which even a monarchy of any great territorial extent could not subsist, but unavoidably broke up into petty principalities, either mutually independent, or held together by a loose tie like the feudal: because the machinery of authority was not perfect enough to carry orders into effect at a great distance from the person of the ruler. He depended mainly upon voluntary fidelity for the obedience even of his army, nor did there exist the means of making the people pay an amount of taxes sufficient for keeping up the force necessary to compel obedience throughout a large territory. In these and all similar cases, it must be understood that the amount of the hindrance may be either greater or less. It may be so great as to make the form of government work very ill, without absolutely precluding its existence, or hindering it from being practically preferable to any other which can be had. This last question mainly depends upon a consideration which we have not yet arrived at--the tendencies of different forms of government to promote Progress.|$|R

For implementation, two sensors are installed for each key: the first sensor detects when a key is beginning to be pressed and the other triggers when the key is <b>pressed</b> <b>completely.</b> On some higher-end electronic keyboards or digital pianos, a third sensor is installed. This third sensor allows the player to strike a key and still sound a note even when the key has not yet come to its full resting position, allowing for faster (and more accurate) playing of repeated notes. The time between the two (or three) signals allows a keyboard to determine the velocity with which the key was struck.

The least sophisticated types of touch sensitivity cause the keyboard to change the volume of the instrument voice.

40|$|Bibliography: pages [73]- 76. President Ronald Reagan's barring of {{the press}} from {{covering}} the invasion of Grenada In October 1983 was a unique action. This case study compares Reagan's action with the action of another president under similar circumstances, provides {{an analysis of the}} comparison, notes steps taken to insure that a complete barring {{of the press}} would not reoccur, and gives one participant's version of one of those steps considered. Chapter I provides a brief overview of the military-press relationship during military maneuvers In the history of the United States, noting those isolated Incidents where Individuals have delayed or barred press reports from sites of military activity. Research showed that no president or administration <b>completely</b> barred the <b>press</b> from covering military activities before Reagan's action in Grenada. To show how unique Reagan's action was, a comparison was established between President Reagan and President Johnson who ordered an invasion of the Dominican Republic in 1965. Chapter III provides a comparison between the islands of the Dominican Republic and Grenada covering their physical descriptions, their political backgrounds, their strategic locations, and the invasions of the islands. Chapter IV provides an analysis of the press coverage of the two invasions. Since the press was not allowed to cover the invasion of Grenada, the analysis section on Grenada concentrates on the lack of coverage as significant. Chapter V explores the relationship between President Johnson and the press in 1965, touching on his relationship with the press over Vietnam, a factor which might have colored what happened in 1983. President Reagan's relationship with the press {{at the time of the}} invasion of Grenada is also discussed, since his handling of the press before the invasion seems to have foreshadowed how the press would be handled during the invasion of Grenada. Chapter VI provides conclusions and evaluations and reviews two suggestions for the press and military working together to cover military activities. Newsweek's Kim WiHenson participated in a practice exercise of the press covering combat situations in Honduras during military exercises. The problems encountered are mentioned and his comments are included. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R
40|$|Try {{to imagine}} having {{never seen an}} airplane. It’s hard. Aircraft are an {{ordinary}} part of our daily experience. Just look up and you’ll probably see one, or at least its vapor trails. Go to your local airport and you can fly in one pretty inexpensively. Heck, if you like, {{you can learn to}} pilot one yourself at any one of hundreds of flying schools. There is just nothing unusual or even very exciting about airships. It wasn’t always so. In {{the first quarter of the}} 20 th century, airplanes were new. People had long dreamed of flight (see “Icarus and Daedalus”) and by the 19 th century they’d done a little of it in balloons. But most folks could hardly conceive of a man (or woman) taking to the air like a bird. But men (and soon women) did just that. To many contemporary observers, flying in winged airships was nothing short of a miracle. Surely, pundits claimed, conquest of the air would usher in a new modern age. It did, but not in all the ways expected. As Thomas Kessner shows in his wonderfully told The Flight of the Century: Charles Lindbergh 2 ̆ 6 the Rise of American Aviation (Oxford University Press, 2010), the experience of Charles Lindbergh is a case in point. To be sure, Lindbergh was an extraordinary pilot—skilled, meticulous, and remarkably brave. That, however, did not set him apart from the hundreds of other fly boys of the age. What did set him apart was: 1) luck (many of his contemporaries died in crashes, and he nearly did on many occasions); 2) a single insight, doggedly pursued (that a plane with one engine, one pilot, and an 2, 385 pounds of fuel could make it from New York to Paris); and 3) the fact that after Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic he became the most famous person in the world. Tom pays due attention to all three of these characteristics, but I found the last of them—Lindbergh’s incredible celebrity and its impact on him and the world—the most interesting. It’s arguable that Lindbergh was the first “superstar. ” Though he had indeed done something extraordinary, he was the creation of a finely tuned, corporate-backed publicity campaign and a frenzied, tireless, and <b>completely</b> meritorious <b>press</b> corps. The people around Lindbergh understood that if they handled his “image” correctly they all could make a fortune. And so they took this gangly, taciturn, strangely aloof son of the prairie and made him the symbol of all that was good (and marketable) in the newly christened air age. The problem was that, eventually, Lindbergh refused to play along. He was who he was, and who he was was a loner. Celebrity wore on him. Now when most people get tired of attention, they go home. But after the Paris flight Lindbergh had no home. His entire life was public. So he did what so many frustrated celebrities with considerable resources (think Howard Hughes, Marlon Brando, J. D. Salinger) after him have done: he became a crank. He tried to find a way to live for ever, dabbled in ‘scientific racism,’ and eventually got mixed up with the Nazis. Lindbergh, the arch-individualist, got tired of having people tell him who he was; he wanted to be his own man. And, in the end, he was, for good and ill. The lesson? If you are in the business of making and selling role models, it’s probably not a good idea to pick a 27 -year old who has focused his life on some narrow pursuit to the exclusion of all others, even if he’s really good at it. You just don’t know what they’re going to “be” when they grow up. (For more, see 2 ̆ 2 Michael Jackson, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Lindsey Lohan, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 LeBron James, 2 ̆ 2 etc., etc. ...|$|R
