5|$|Another blow to Soviet <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> the First World {{came with}} the {{establishment}} of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported the ideals of Soviet communism {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle was that it was the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical of Soviet <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E
5|$|After 1952 the Polish sport {{life was}} {{organized}} through the Polish Cultural and Educational Union. Through the communist era Polish minority declined demographically and this process continue to date, hence {{after the fall}} of <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> 1989 only a few sport organizations resumed their activity. Beskid Śląski, the only notable one, focuses on tourism. No exclusively Polish sport club exists today in Zaolzie.|$|E
5|$|Following the German-Soviet {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939, President Ignacy Mościcki fled to Romania, taking the presidential insignia, including two specimens of the Banner of the Republic, with him.

5|$|In 1978, Pope John Paul II, {{formerly}} Archbishop of Kraków in then-Communist Poland, {{became the}} first non-Italian pope in 455 years. His 27-year pontificate {{was one of the}} longest in history. Mikhail Gorbachev, the president of the Soviet Union, credited the Polish pope with hastening the fall of <b>Communism</b> <b>in</b> Europe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century Białystok was an {{important}} center for light industry, which {{was the reason for}} the substantial growth of the city's population. The tradition continued with many garment factories established in the twentieth century, such as Fasty in the district of Bacieczki. However, after the fall of <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> 1989 many of these factories faced severe problems and subsequently closed down.|$|E
5|$|Pilecki's {{place of}} burial has never been found but {{is thought to be}} somewhere within Warsaw's Powązki Cemetery.

5|$|A {{number of}} notable figures have been President of the Parliament and its predecessors. The first President was Paul-Henri Spaak MEP, {{one of the}} {{founding}} fathers of the Union. Other founding fathers include Alcide de Gasperi MEP and Robert Schuman MEP. The two female Presidents were Simone Veil MEP in 1979 (first President of the elected Parliament) and Nicole Fontaine MEP in 1999, both Frenchwomen. The previous president, Jerzy Buzek was the first East-Central European to lead an EU institution, a former Prime Minister of Poland who rose out of the Solidarity movement in Poland that helped overthrow <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> the Eastern Bloc.|$|E
5|$|After the war Mazurkiewicz was persecuted by the Soviet-led {{communist}} {{authorities of}} the People's Republic of Poland, kept {{for two years}} in pre-trial jail, tortured and sentenced to life, {{despite the fact that he}} tried to cooperate with the new regime. He was rehabilitated after the end of the Stalinist period in 1956 and became active in the official veterans' organization Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy (ZBoWiD). He was eventually promoted to the rank of general of the Armed Forces of the People's Republic of Poland (LWP). He died shortly before the fall of <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> Eastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 600 Jews {{were killed}} in Greater Albania during the war. Albania-proper emerged from the war with a {{population}} of Jews eleven times greater than at the beginning, numbering around 1,800 individuals. Most of these subsequently emigrated to Israel, but several hundred remained until the fall of <b>Communism</b> <b>in</b> the early 1990s before they did the same. As of 2011, 69 Albanians have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations for the role they played in saving Jews during the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|As Police Commissioner Blamey {{defended the}} actions of the police during the 1928 Waterside Workers' Federation dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a {{striking}} worker who was also a Gallipoli veteran, and wounding several others. His treatment of the unionists was typical of his hard line anti-communist beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response to the rise of <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.|$|E
5|$|Former {{students}} from Prague, including Constantine Menges, and Czech {{refugees from the}} crisis, {{who were able to}} escape or resettle in Western Countries continued to advocate for human rights, religious liberty, freedom of speech and political asylum for Czech political prisoners and dissidents. Many raised concerns about the Soviet Union and Red Army's continued military occupation of the Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 1980s, prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of <b>Communism</b> <b>in</b> Moscow and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5000|$|In 1972 Moon {{predicted}} {{the decline of}} communism, based on {{the teachings of the}} Divine Principle: [...] "After 7,000 biblical years — 6,000 years of restoration history plus the millennium, the time of completion — <b>communism</b> will fall <b>in</b> its 70th year. Here is the meaning of the year 1978. <b>Communism,</b> begun <b>in</b> 1917, could maintain itself approximately 60 years and reach its peak. So 1978 is the border line and afterward <b>communism</b> will decline; <b>in</b> the 70th year it will be altogether ruined. This is true. Therefore, {{now is the time for}} people who are studying communism to abandon it." ...|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{perceived}} atheistic nature of communism, some have accused communism of persecuting religion. In addition, another criticism is that <b>communism</b> is, <b>in</b> itself, a religion.|$|R

He had, a few weeks before, been awarded Poland's highest honour, the Order of the White Eagle (only the second person to receive this since the collapse of <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> Poland—the first had been Pope John Paul II). He was cremated; his devoted wife Danuta died shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In January 1957, the US {{adopted the}} Eisenhower Doctrine and pledged {{to prevent the}} spread of {{communism}} and its perceived agents in the Middle East. Although Nasser was an opponent of <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> the region, his promotion of pan-Arabism was viewed as a threat by pro-Western states in the region. Eisenhower tried to isolate Nasser and reduce his regional influence by attempting to transform King Saud into a counterweight. Also in January, the elected Jordanian prime minister and Nasser supporter Sulayman al-Nabulsi brought Jordan into a military pact with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|In postwar Poland, the {{government}} bought {{most of the}} land where the camp had stood, and built a large stone memorial there between 1959 and 1962. In 1964 Treblinka was declared a national monument of Jewish martyrology in a ceremony {{at the site of the}} former gas chambers. In the same year the first German trials were held regarding war crimes committed at Treblinka by former SS members. After the end of <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> Poland in 1989, the number of visitors coming to Treblinka from abroad increased. An exhibition centre at the camp opened in 2006. It was later expanded and made into a branch of the Siedlce Regional Museum.|$|E

5|$|Indonesian {{independence}} was secured through {{a blend of}} both diplomacy and force. Despite their ill-discipline raising the prospect of anarchy, without youth confronting foreign and Indonesian colonial forces, Republican diplomatic efforts would have been futile. The revolution is the turning point of modern Indonesian history, and it has provided the reference point and validation for the country’s major political trends that continue to the present day. It gave impetus to <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> the country, to militant nationalism, to Sukarno's 'guided democracy', to political Islam, {{the origins of the}} Indonesian army and its role in Indonesian power, the country's constitutional arrangements, and the centralism of power in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{some social}} scientists, such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Frank Gibney, refer to these changes as a revolution, one less {{dramatic}} than its Hungarian counterpart but one {{which may have}} had an even more profound impact on the Eastern Bloc. Timothy Garton Ash calls the Polish October the most significant event in the post-war history of Poland until the rise of Solidarity. History professor Iván T. Berend claims that while {{the effects of the}} Polish October on the Eastern Bloc may be disputed, it set the course for the eventual fall of <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> the People's Republic of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Sang Penari {{touches on}} the history of <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia, {{focusing}} on the nation's communist party spreading its ideology and the government's purge of the Communist Party's members from 1965–1966, which is thought to have killed several hundred thousand. It is only the third Indonesian film to cover the killings, following Arifin C. Noer's G30S/PKI (1984) and Riri Riza's Gie (2005). Tohari later said that if he had written about the killings as they were depicted in the film, the repressive New Order government would have had him shot.|$|E
