First the effect of calving years on actual milk yield, daily milk yield, 305 –day milk yield, 305 –day mature age milk yield, lactation duration and dry period days were investigated. In 2000 to 2006, the actual milk yield, daily milk yield, 305 –day milk yield, 305 –day mature age milk yield, lactation duration and dry period days were significantly related to calving years. Second the effect of <b>calving</b> <b>times</b> on actual milk yield, daily milk yield, 305 –day milk yield, 305 –day mature age milk yield, lactation duration and dry period days were detected.

40|$|Calving is an {{essential}} event in dairy production, as lactation only begins after calving and cows must give birth at regular intervals {{in order to maintain}} milk production. Careful management is important during the weeks around calving as this is when dairy cows most frequently experience health problems. Experienced stockmen use judgements based on physical and behavioural changes in order to recognise when cows may be about to calve, and subsequently be available to offer assistance when required. With increasing herd sizes and large numbers of cows per stockman, individual attention is often difficult. An automated system that monitors behavioural or physiological changes before calving could potentially be used to predict the <b>time</b> of <b>calving,</b> and help improve supervision by farm staff. Data comprising two years of records from Langhill Farm were used to identify any variables which could be used for calving prediction or as risk factors for various calving problems. Records kept by stockmen detailing the signs of <b>calving</b> and <b>time</b> of observation were compared with quantitative behavioural data. Observations from video recordings were used to identify any consistent behavioural changes occurring the day before calving {{that could be used to}} predict the onset of calving. The frequencies of lying and tail raises proved to be the most useful indicators, as they showed consistent changes in the final six hours before calving. Differences between heifers and cows, and between those experiencing calving difficulties and those which did not, were also investigated. Differences between heifers and cows were shown which should be taken into account when predicting <b>calving</b> <b>times.</b> However, no early-warning signs of difficulties were identified for cows and heifers assisted with a calving jack. Cows were also fitted with collars containing accelerometers to investigate if features in tri-axial accelerometer data could be shown to correspond to specific behaviours. Some success was achieved in identifying eating behaviour and postural changes, demonstrating that there is potential for monitoring behaviour using this method. Weekly heart rate recordings were also taken to establish if there was a change in the heart rate or heart rate variability during the final six weeks of gestation. Changes were found but, although they were statistically significant, they were considered too subtle for any practical application. Consistent changes in behaviour were observed in the six hours before calving, some of which could be measured using accelerometers. These changes have the potential to be used as the basis of an automated monitoring system to predict calving. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The {{supervision}} of the animals metabolism is {{a key factor in}} herd health monitoring during transit period. It is regarded to recognize and prevent subclinical metabolic disorders Subclinical ketosis {{is one of the most}} frequent and economically harmful metabolic disease during transit period. This disease causes losses in milk yield and increases the risk of clinical diseases. The β- hydroxybutyrate concentration (BHB) is an appropriate diagnostic parameter for subclinical ketosis. Furthermore, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) are used to identify animals suffering from subclinical ketosis. The objective of this paper was to examine influencing factors on BHB concentration and the impact of BHB concentration, regarding animal health and milk production. For that purpose, 1, 949 cows (Holstein-Friesian) were examined. Specimen collection from 5 th April 2013 to 22 nd February 2014 compromised calving cows with an average 305 -day milk yield of up to 10, 750 kg. Milk fat yield reached a total of 3. 61 % and milk protein yield 3. 15 %. Cows between 1. - 11. lactation were found in the dairy herd. Blood samples were taken from the Vena or Arteria coccygea mediana at the time of transition in the close up group, at <b>calving</b> <b>time</b> and three additional samples on day one, three and seven post partum during feeding time in the morning. The parameters BHB and NEFA were determined from blood samples. Additionally, backfat thickness was identified by ultrasound during dry period, at transition in the close up group as well as one day post partum and at exit of the transition-cowshed. The transition period and dates as calving, calf number, weight, gender, calving process were recorded. Moreover, any disease, milk productivity (daily-, weekly-, 305 -day milk yield) and fertility parameters were monitored. Postpartum BHB concentration at the first week averages 0, 50 mmol/l. Subclinical ketosis was found with a prevalence of 12. 7 %. Analysis revealed a variety of influencing factors on BHB concentration. NEFA concentration during calving, calf number and time of calving were determined as influencing factors for heifers. However, NEFA concentration at <b>calving</b> <b>time</b> is the major factor. In the model of multiparous cows most significant influencing factors are: lactation number, Kexxtone®-Bolus, length of transition period, backfat thickness at <b>calving</b> <b>time,</b> month of calving, calf number and antepartum NEFA concentration. Kexxtone® is the strongest influencing factor, subsequent is the transition period. NEFA concentration before calving and backfat thickness at <b>calving</b> <b>time</b> have the same impact. Calving month, lactation number and calf number just have a small influence on BHB concentration. The impact of the animals lactation number is getting reduced by Kexxtone®. Strongest influencing factor on getting ketosis is a BHB concentration on day 3 after calving ≥ 1. 2 mmol/l. Variability of ketosis can be explained by BHB concentration in 10. 1 % of cases. Other factors are: calf number, month of calving, difference of backfat thickness in the first three weeks of lactation, time of the dry period and milk yield in week 3 - 7. Together these factors sum up 28. 1 % of the variability of ketosis. The number of lactation does not give a further informative effect. Not considered factors like genetics, milk productivity before lactation or pre-existing illnesses could clarify the model. There was no shown effect of the BHB concentration on the fertility in this study. Additionally there was no correlation between mastitis and lameness and the BHB concentration level. BHB concentration is related with milk yield. Cows with a BHB concentration of ≥ 1. 2 mmol/l have a lower milk productivity as cows with a BHB concentration < 1. 2 mmol/l. The earlier there is an increased BHB concentration the bigger is the loss of milk productivity. A BHB concentration of ≥ 1. 2 mmol/l during calving leads to a reduction of 305 -day milk yield of 1, 390 kg. Healthy cows have a lower BHB concentration than sick cows. The cut-off of ≥ 1. 2 mmol/l postpartum BHB is suitable to forecast metabolic diseases. Odds ratio are: abomasal displacement OR= 19. 0 (BHB 7), hypocalcaemia OR= 9. 3 (BHB 0), retentio secundinarum OR= 5. 0 (BHB 0) and metritis OR= 6. 0 / 2. 0 (BHB 0 /BHB 7) ...|$|E

40|$|During the peripartum, {{dairy cows}} often show an acute phase {{response}} (APR). APR severity and duration {{are related to}} health, liver metabolism, performance and body losses. Triggers of APR are pro-inflammatory cytokines (PIC), but scarce are the knowledge of their pattern of changes in transition period. To clarify this aspect, 10 multiparous cows were studied 4 wk before and after calving. Besides health status, feed intake, milk yield, rectal temperature, body weight and BCS, blood was frequently sampled to determine a large metabolic-inflammatory profile, in addition to IL- 1  and IL- 6. Cows were retrospectively classified into 3 groups according to IL- 6 plasma levels {{in the last month}} of pregnancy: LO-IL (2 cows), IN-IL (4 cows) and UP-IL (4 cows). Data were processed by the MIXED repeated procedure of SAS. According to the ranking of cows, the average levels of IL- 6 during last month of pregnancy were 159, 264 and 802 pg/ml for LO-IL, IN-IL and UP-IL groups respectively (P< 0. 05). IL- 1  was well related to IL- 6 (r = 0. 40; P< 0. 001) and showed a similar pattern of changes. In late pregnancy, levels of both PIC showed some fluctuations without any association to clinical diseases. In all groups, both PIC displayed a small and short-lived raise at <b>calving</b> <b>time,</b> often related to diseases. Thereafter, PIC levels in IN-IL and UP-IL decreased and differences between groups disappeared. Cows with higher PIC levels before calving had worse health status after calving, ate less, had higher rectal temperature, lost more body reserves and produced less milk. Contemporaneously, UP-IL cows showed more severe APR, as suggested by the marked and prolonged increase of haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin; the pattern of changes of some APR related parameters - as bilirubin (increase), zinc (reduction) and albumin (reduction) - confirm this status. Thus, the average IL- 6 level at the end of pregnancy seems related to the higher susceptibility to inflammation at <b>calving</b> <b>time</b> and to the worsening of the health status and performance. Nevertheless, before calving no clear APR was detected, plasma ceruloplasmin had an higher level in UP-IL and IN-IL vs LO-IL, while albumin showed a progressive decrease in UP-IL 2 weeks pre-calving. Therefore, further studies are needed to clarify reasons of so different levels of PIC before calving and the link between high PIC level and increased susceptibility to inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Population ecology is {{concerned}} with measuring changes in population size and composition, and identifying the causes of these fluctuations. Important driving variables include animal body size and growth rate, {{and their relationship to}} reproduction and mortality. Among wild and domestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), reproductive performance, <b>calving</b> <b>time,</b> calf birth weight and neonatal mortality are strongly correlated to maternal weight. Heavy females enjoy higher pregnancy rates, calve earlier, and give birth to heavier calves which have a higher neonatal survival rate than light females. Most studies indicate that both weaning weight of a calf and mature body weight correlate to its birth weight. Calf body weight and composition influence the rate of attainment of sexual maturity. Females which breed as calves suffer reduced growth and give birth to smaller calves, which suffer higher neonatal mortality and lower rates of postnatal growth. A yet unresolved question is whether reindeer body weight, and hence reproductive performance and neonatal mortality, are more strongly influenced by winter than by summer grazing conditions.

In general, about 87 % of females exposed to breeding produced a live calf and 6 % of these died before reaching four weeks of age. The herd to herd variation in these rates was quite large, the coefficient of variation being about 17 %. The stillbirth rate was 1. 7 % and the abortion rate 1. 2 %. In general, herds in northern Ontario and herds whose owners kept breeding and calving records, had reduced livebirth rates, the latter probably reflecting accuracy of data. Herds with a restricted (less than three months) breeding season had increased livebirth rates. Herds using injectable vitamins ADE, and prophylactic antibiotics, had increased neonatal losses. Herds with a restricted calving season (less {{than or equal to}} 3 months) and/or feeding free choice salt to cows had decreased neonatal losses. Herdsize and calf mortality rate were directly related, but this {{did not appear to be}} due to increased density of cows at <b>calving</b> <b>time.</b> In herds, where calving occurred during the spring, using scour vaccines in calves was associated with increased calf mortality...|$|E
40|$|In {{livestock}} farming, accurate {{prediction of}} <b>calving</b> <b>time</b> {{is a key}} factor for profitability and animal welfare. The most accurate and sensitive methods to date for prediction of calving within 24 h are the measurement of pelvic ligament relaxation and assays for circulating progesterone and oestradiol- 17 β. Conversely, the absence of calving within the next 12 - 24 h can be accurately predicted by the measurement of incremental daily decrease in vaginal temperature and by the combination of pelvic ligament relaxation and teat filling estimates. Continuous monitoring systems can detect behavioural changes occurring on the actual day of calving, some of them being accentuated {{in the last few}} hours before delivery; standing/lying transitions, tail raising, feeding time, and dry matter and water intakes, differ between cows with dystocia and those with eutocia. Use of these behavioural changes has the potential to improve the management of calving. Currently, four types of devices for calving detection are on the market: inclinometers and accelerometers detecting tail raising and overactivity, abdominal belts monitoring uterine contractions, vaginal probes detecting a decrease in vaginal temperature and expulsion of the allantochorion, and devices placed in the vagina or on the vulvar lips that detect calf expulsion. The performance of these devices under field conditions and their capacity to predict dystocia require further investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{causes of}} death in <b>calves</b> at the <b>time</b> of birth or soon {{thereafter}} have long {{been the subject of}} investigation. Bacterial diseases have received wide-spread attention, and recently nutritional deficiencies have been the object of research. Capable biological chemists have entered this field and are making fine contributions toward the solution of some of the diseases of the new born encountered by the veterinary clinician. In this connection {{it should be pointed out}} that the calf loss at the time of parturition and during the succeeding weeks costs the livestock industry a terrific toll. It is said that as high as 20 percent of dairy calves do not reach maturity...|$|R
50|$|Females with calves tend {{to gather}} in nursery groups in shallow water. Nursery groups likely provide mothers and <b>calves</b> more <b>time</b> to rest, which is {{important}} for both. While the behaviours of nursery groups vary by month, resting is the predominant behaviour during most months. The formation of nursery groups in shallow waters also allows members to hunt prey species that inhabit in these waters. Both adults and calves have been observed to chase and catch fish, and the adults may be teaching the calves how to hunt. In contrast to shallower waters, hunting in deep water at night may be too dangerous for calves. Calves are particularly vulnerable to predators like killer whales and use of shallow water by nursery groups may {{be a way to}} avoid predation. Nursery groups tend to avoid mating groups. Adult males in these groups will aggressively herd and chase females. They can separate calves from their mothers and harass them, as well. Calves may also become even more vulnerable to predators as they become exhausted and disoriented. Mother dolphins may look after calves that are not their own.|$|R
40|$|In a predator-prey system, prey {{species may}} {{adapt to the}} {{presence}} of predators with behavioral changes such as increased vigilance, shifting habitats, or changes in their mobility. In North America, moose (Alces alces) have shown behavioral adaptations to presence of predators, but such antipredator behavioral responses have not yet been found in Scandinavian moose in response to the recolonization of wolves (Canis lupus). We studied travel speed and direction of movement of GPS-collared female moose (n = 26) in relation to spatiotemporal differences in wolf predation risk, reproductive status, and time of year. Travel speed was highest during the calving (May-July) and postcalving (August-October) seasons and was lower for females with calves than females without <b>calves.</b> Similarly, <b>time</b> of year and reproductive status affected the direction of movement, as more concentrated movement was observed for females with calves at heel, during the calving season. We did not find support for that wolf predation risk was an important factor affecting moose travel speed or direction of movement. Likely causal factors for the weak effect of wolf predation risk on mobility of moose include high moose-to-wolf ratio and intensive hunter harvest of the moose population during the past century...|$|R
