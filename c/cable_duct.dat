Corrosion of prestressing steel is more dangerous than the corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete. Stress corrosion is propagated due to corrosion initiation in prestressing steel under stressed condition. Corrosion resistance of the prestressing steel depends upon the grout material. In this investigation three types of grout materials namely cement grout with non-shrinking admixture, polyurethane foam and epoxy grout were assessed for its suitability within the prestressing <b>cable</b> <b>duct.</b> The performance of grout materials to protect against prestressing steel corrosion was evaluated by different electrochemical techniques such as OCP measurements, anodic polarisation test and impressed voltage technique. The mechanical property of the different grout materials were test at room and elevated temperature. Among the three grouts, epoxy based grout system showed better corrosion resistance properties...|$|E

40|$|Actually complex {{underground}} {{structures and}} facilities occupy a wide space in our cities, {{most of them}} are often unsurveyed; <b>cable</b> <b>duct,</b> drainage system are not exception. Furthermore, several inspection operations are performed in critical air condition, that do not allow or make more difficult a conventional survey. In this scenario a prompt methodology to survey and georeferencing such facilities is often indispensable. A visual based approach was proposed in this paper; such methodology provides a 3 D model of the environment and the path followed by the camera using the conventional photogrammetric/Structure from motion software tools. The key-role is played by the lens camera; indeed, a fisheye system was employed to obtain a very wide field of view (FOV) and therefore high overlapping among the frames. The camera geometry is in according to a forward motion along the axis camera. Consequently, to avoid instability of bundle adjustment algorithm a preliminary calibration of camera was carried out.

30|$|The low {{quasi-static}} {{strength of}} less than 1  MPa has to be considered and large bonding areas should be used. The impact tests on a compact specimen design to be mounted directly in a small Charpy test machine showed the well-known ability of elastic PUR adhesives for withstanding much higher impact loads than quasi-static loads. An approach on a similar specific energy application for a larger real mass bonded on a large area of {{the walls of a}} monopole, and a small specimen with low mass and small adhesive bond area was calculated. A repetitive application of only 39 blows with a specific configuration was performed and a small number of specimens achieved the target, others failed in different ways due to the not fully optimized method. In fact, not all specimens survived the full test period and showed that larger masses should be bonded on as much bonding area as possible and users of this technology should follow the joint design recommendations of best practices given in the literature. That leads in particular to the recommendation for bonding large structures (<b>cable</b> <b>duct</b> length of up to 50  m) in separated smaller sections instead. This approach mainly avoids interfering vibrations with large mass and amplitudes. Finally, the elastic adhesive showed also an excellent sealing function, which made the use of extra sealing material on the sensor housings obsolete. Hence, adhesive bonding of the entire equipment for a fully autonomously pile driving monitoring of an impact driven large scale foundation structure for an offshore wind farm can be considered a completely new and very reliable application method.|$|E
40|$|With {{residual}} uncertainties at the 10 ^- 18 level, modern {{atomic frequency}} standards constitute extremely precise measurement devices. Besides frequency and time metrology, they provide valuable tools {{to investigate the}} validity of Einstein's theory of general relativity, to test a possible time variation of the fundamental constants, and to verify predictions of quantum electrodynamics. Furthermore, applications as diverse as geodesy, satellite navigation, and very long base-line interferometry may benefit from steadily improving precision of both microwave and optical atomic clocks. Clocks ticking at optical frequencies slice time into much finer intervals than microwave clocks and thus provide increased stability. It is expected that this {{will result in a}} redefinition of the second in the International System of Units (SI). However, any frequency measurement is based on a comparison to a second, ideally more precise frequency. A single clock, as highly developed as it may be, is useless if it is not accessible for applications. Unfortunately, the most precise optical clocks or frequency standards can not be readily transported. Hence, in order to link the increasing number of world-wide precision laboratories engaged in state-of-the-art optical frequency standards, a suitable infrastructure is of crucial importance. Today, the stabilities of current satellite based dissemination techniques using global satellite navigation systems (such as GPS, GLONASS) or two way satellite time and frequency transfer reach an uncertainty level of 10 ^- 15 after one day of comparison. While this is sufficient for the comparison of most microwave clock systems, the exploitation of the full potential of optical clocks requires more advanced techniques. This work demonstrates that the transmission of an optical carrier phase via telecommunication fiber links can provide a highly accurate means for clock comparisons reaching continental scales: Two 920 km long fibers are used to connect MPQ (Max-Planck- Institut für Quantenoptik, Garching, Germany) and PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Braunschweig, Germany) separated by a geographical distance of 600 km. The fibers run in a <b>cable</b> <b>duct</b> next to a gas pipeline and are actively compensated for fluctuations of their optical path length that lead to frequency offsets via the Doppler effect. Together with specially designed and remotely controllable in-line amplication this enables the transfer of an ultra-stable optical signal across a large part of Germany with a stability of 5 x 10 ^- 15 after one second, reaching 10 ^- 18 after less than 1000 seconds of integration time. Any frequency deviation induced by the transmission can be constrained to be smaller than 4 x 10 ^- 19. As a first application, the fiber link was used to measure the 1 S- 2 S two photon transition frequency in atomic hydrogen at MPQ referenced to PTB's primary Cs-fountain clock (CSF 1). Hydrogen allows for precise theoretical analysis and the named transition possesses a narrow natural line width of 1. 3 Hz. Hence, this experiment constitutes a very accurate test bed for quantum electrodynamics and has been performed at MPQ with ever increasing accuracy. The latest measurement has reached a level of precision at which satellite-based referencing to a remote primary clock is limiting the experiment. Using the fiber link, a frequency measurement can be carried out directly since the transmission via the optical carrier phase provides orders of magnitude better stability than state-of-the-art microwave clocks. The achieved results demonstrate that high-precision optical frequency dissemination via optical fibers can be employed in real world applications. Embedded in an existing telecommunication network and passing several urban agglomerations the fiber link now permanently connects MPQ and PTB and is operated routinely. It represents far more than a proof-of-principle experiment conducted under optimized laboratory conditions. Rather it constitutes a solution for the topical issue of remote optical clock comparison. This opens a variety of applications in fundamental physics such as tests of general and special relativity as well as quantum electrodynamics. Beyond that, such a link will enable clock-based, relativistic geodesy at the sub-decimeter level. Further applications in navigation, geology, dynamic ocean topography and seismology are currently being discussed. In the future, this link will serve as a backbone of a Europe-wide optical frequency dissemination network...|$|E
