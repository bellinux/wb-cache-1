50|$|The Amphibia is the {{embodiment}} of possibly the most simple concept for creating a watertight case. The basic principle {{is to use the}} outside pressure to create the seal needed to prevent water from entering the case. The further the case sinks, the higher the outside pressure, the higher pressure is exerted on the case, creating a dynamically tighter seal. This is opposed to the idea where you create a case that creates the pressure to withstand 20ATM of pressure no matter what pressure it experiences (1 ATM at sealevel, for instance). This is a design similar to the western <b>compressor</b> <b>case,</b> a patent for which was filed at least as early as 1954, and granted in '56(US pat. 2,737,009). The advantage of the compression design is that you do not need to tighten any of the seals to a pressure that would withstand 20ATM, it also eliminates several pieces required to create such a seal.|$|E
50|$|The {{double-sided}} impeller was 28.8 {{inches in}} diameter, compared to 20.68 for the Derwent I, {{to produce an}} airflow of 80 lb/s, while the overall diameter of the engine was 49.5 inches. A scaled up Derwent would have a 60-inch diameter. The compressor casing was based on Whittle's Type 16 W.2/500 <b>compressor</b> <b>case</b> which was more aerodynamically efficient than that on the Derwent but also eliminated cracking. Other design advances included nine new low pressure-drop/high efficiency combustion chambers developed by Lucas and a small impeller for rear bearing and turbine disc cooling. The first engine start was attempted on 27 October 1944. A number of snags delayed the run until nearly midnight, when with almost the entire day and night shift staff watching, {{an attempt was made}} to start the engine, without the inlet vanes, which had not yet been fitted. To everyone's dismay the engine refused to light - positioning the igniter was a trial-and-error affair at the time. On the next attempt, Denis Drew unscrewed the igniter and as the starter motor ran the engine up to speed, lit the engine with an oxy-acetylene torch. The engine was run up to 4,000 lbf and more, and a cheer went up around the assembled personnel. Upon Hooker's arrival next morning, and informed that the inlet vanes had been fitted during the night, Hooker was satisfied to see the thrust gauge needle registering 5,000 lbf, making the B.41 the most powerful jet engine in the world.

However, these systems mostly dependent on prior experience, and product designers not only {{expect to get}} a satisfactory case from an intelligent system but also hope to achieve assistance in modifying unsatisfactory cases. In this article, we proposed a new categorization method composed of static and dynamic classification based on extension theory. This classification method can be integrated into case-based reasoning system to get accurate classification results and to inform designers of detailed information about unsatisfactory cases. First, we establish the static classification model for cases by dependent function in a hierarchical structure. Then for dynamic classification, we make transformation for cases based on case model, attributes, attribute values, and dependent function, thus cases can take qualitative changes. Finally, the applicability of proposed method is demonstrated through {{a case study of}} screw air <b>compressor</b> <b>cases...</b>|$|R

50|$|It {{works by}} passing cooling air through {{passages}} internal to the blade. Heat is transferred by conduction through the blade, {{and then by}} convection into the air flowing inside of the blade. A large internal surface area is desirable for this method, so the cooling paths tend to be serpentine and full of small fins. The internal passages in the blade may be circular or elliptical in shape. Cooling is achieved by passing the air through these passages from hub towards the blade tip.

40|$|Economic aspects such as {{reducing}} specific {{fuel consumption}} and ever growing environmental requirements on emissions and perceived noise levels are the major incentives in the pursuit to improve aircraft engines. The overall efficiency of the engine {{is a combination of}} propulsive efficiency and thermal efficiency. A new, promising engine concept with very high propulsive efficiency is the so-called Open Rotor. In order to facilitate high thermal efficiency, the core of the engine must be designed with a high turbine inlet temperature as well as a high overall pressure ratio in combination with being light and compact. For the low-pressure compression system, the desire to reduce weight leads to a reduction of the number of stages. This must be realized by a combination of high transonic rotor speeds and high stage loadings {{in order to maintain the}} required pressure ratio. However, this becomes a tough design challenge aerodynamically as it will be more difficult to design the compressor with respect to high efficiency and sufficient stability along the entire operating line. This thesis presents a new design methodology, accounting for both efficiency and stability. The optimal set of solutions in the multi-objective space is explored with help of CFD computations integrated with an optimization framework that consists of a meta-model assisted genetic algorithm. In order to utilize the design process for industrial applications, the reductions in total design time and computational resources are also addressed.

The primary focus is on fan and compressor materials (polymer-matrix composites [...] PMC's), compressor and turbine materials (superalloys, and metal-matrix and intermetallic-matrix composites [...] MMC's and IMC's) and turbine materials (ceramic-matrix composites [...] CMC's). These advanced materials are being developed by in-house researchers and on grants and contracts.
