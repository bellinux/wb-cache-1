The aims of this study are to identify, describe and contrast the forms and pattern of greetings and leave-takings in English and Sangiric Language. This research uses descriptive and contrastive analysis. The data in English were collected from books related to sociolinguistics, book of speaking, and source from internet, the data in Sangiric Language were collected by writing and recording the conversations that occurred on the situation, the time and opportunity in places such as: the conversation that occurred while passing on the street, conversations between family members (in the house), a conversation between teachers and school officials, a conversation at the office, place of worship and other, the data Analyzed were using the consepts of Fishman, Tillit and Bruder. The result of this research shows that greetings and leave-takings in English and Sangiric Language have two forms; they are formal and informal. In addition, the writer finds that there are three patterns in English and Sangiric Language on greetings. Those patterns are the mutual formal greetings, the mutual informal greetings and the <b>non</b> <b>mutual</b> greetings. The patterns of English leave-taking are the same as their greetings. On the other hand, Sangirics Language has only two patterns of <b>non</b> <b>mutual</b> leave-takings, formal and informal. Greetings and leave-takings in English and Sangiric Language has differences. For instance, greetings and leave-takings in English are various. Meanwhile in Sangiric language are limited...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{compositionality}} of liveness when synchronizing two coloured FIFO nets. The composition operator allows to merge transitions {{as well as some}} adjacent places or queues. A behavioural sufficient condition for liveness compositionality relies on a <b>mutual</b> <b>non</b> constraining relation between component nets. A structural sufficient condition for synchronization preserving liveness is then given {{in the case of a}} state machine at the interface of the merged elements with the non merged ones of each component net. It requires that the conflictual coloured transitions of the interface state machines satisfy the structural freeing or blocking relations. Finally an example shows how these conditions simplify the analysis of a protocol within a layered architecture.

40|$|AbstractIn Thailand, bank {{subsidiaries}} constitute 90 % {{of market}} share of mutual fund industry. The stated fact leads us to categorize mutual fund firms into: Bank related <b>mutual</b> funds and <b>Non</b> bank related <b>mutual</b> funds and try to understand how investors perceive and choose among the two types mutual fund. This study focuses on Long Term Fund (LTF) and Retirement Mutual Fund (RMF). Investors in LTF and RMF are highly addicted to tax advantage. So, this study investigates more on investors’ portfolio as if holding period of LTF is extended from 5 to 10 years. The results show that determinant factors for choosing between bank and <b>non</b> bank <b>mutual</b> fund are the perception of convenience and confidence toward them. Extended holding period causes investors to allocate less into LTF and RMF (28. 22 % to 22. 82 %) which is 19. 14 % drop in LTF and RMF. This implies a loss of large amount of asset under management...|$|R

40|$|Similarities between {{adolescent}} {{friends have}} been established for many characteristics, including the physical, behavioral, psychological, academic, and social domains of development. Past research and theory also {{support the notion that}} psychological and behavioral characteristics are likely related to ego-identity characteristics. This study was primarily a test of the logical extension of the previous statements: Best friends are more similar than nonfriends on identity characteristics. It was also hypothesized that best friends are more similar than nonfriends on behaviors, attitudes, and intentions expected to be related to identity. A sample of 1, 159 grade 10 - 12 students responded to a survey that included a measure of identity status levels, based on a modified Objective Measure of Ego Identity Status. The self-response survey also contained additional items that assessed behaviors, attitudes, and intentions. When comparing 198 pairs of mutually identified adolescent best friends and like numbers of pairs of <b>non</b> <b>mutual</b> best friends and randomly paired non friends, several tests of similarity indicated that best friends shared distinct similarities in ego identity. Magnitudes of similarity indicators were greater for measures of identity in specific content areas than for the global identity status levels or interpersonal and ideological domains. In addition, best friends were more similar than nonfriends on many behaviors, attitudes, and intentions expected to be related to identity. However, similarities of best friends were not related to the duration of the friendship. Weak relationships between identity and academics across grade levels suggested a possible reduction of identity similarities in friend pairs over time. No clear relationships were found between friends 2 ̆ 7 similarities and friends 2 ̆ 7 friendship strength. Finally, only inconsistent differences between females and males were found in the relationships of identity status levels, behaviors, attitudes, and intentions with friendship duration, friendship strength, and grade level...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: One of the {{astonishing}} {{new developments in}} the financial community&# 13; is the rise of ethical investments during the last decade. Particularly, the recent financial crisis has&# 13; determined a major attention towards an ethically oriented finance based on social investments and&# 13; environmental benefits that can create greater corporate crisis prevention. Because of the sheer size and&# 13; importance of the ethical mutual funds, we thought to compare the ethical and non ethical mutual&# 13; funds. Approach: The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the ethical and <b>non</b> ethical <b>mutual</b> funds under&# 13; Italian and foreign law highlighting how some factors, such as performance, typology (equity,&# 13; balanced, fixed income), geographic location, management fees, characterize these funds in different&# 13; way. Results: The analysis has been carried out collecting a data set of 219 mutual funds published on&# 13; www. morningstar. com. The data set is subdivided in 109 ethical <b>mutual</b> funds and 110 <b>non</b> ethical&# 13; <b>mutual</b> funds. The study uses a multi-disciplinary approach and it is led by a Multiple Correspondence&# 13; Analysis (MCA) which puts in evidence the principal characteristics of the mutual funds by their&# 13; projection on a factorial plane. Later the multivariate analysis carries out typologies of mutual funds&# 13; clusters with particular characteristics by a Cluster Analysis. The study confirmed the existence of&# 13; different characteristics with reference to the ethical and <b>non</b> ethical <b>mutual</b> funds. Particularly, it puts&# 13; in evidence three groups of funds which are inside homogeneous but heterogeneous between them by&# 13; the characteristics considered. The first groups, defined negative ethical performance, is composed&# 13; of 152 funds. The second groups, named positive non ethical performance, is characterized by non&# 13; ethical fund (50. 23 % of them is present in this group). The third cluster is called young funds and it&# 13; is composed of funds born in the period 2005 - 2008. Conclusion: Finally, the results indicated that the&# 13; ethical funds are different from the non ethical funds with regards to the performance and put in&# 13; evidence that the ethical funds governed the financial crisis triggered by subprime in a better way than&# 13; the non ethical funds. Consequently we argue that it is important that the interests of the financial&# 13; community are addressed to the development and promotion of ethically oriented finance and of its&# 13; instruments...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{theoretical}} investigation of long term coverage of health risks. I focus upon two key features {{in a long}} term perspective: first, individuals bear the risk that their risk category may change through time; second, in the long run, uncertainty may be "radical", i. e., difficult to probabilise. After briefly summarising the dynamic elements of theories of solidarity (according to Leon Bourgeois and John Rawls), the second part presents recent economic approaches of long term risk management, and reviews the solutions that have been offered in the area of health care. The third part attempts to apply these solutions to the French health insurance system made of two parts: mandatory public insurance, and private supplementary insurance, regulated by the Loi Evin. Lastly, the final section offers a first examination, both theoretical and descriptive, of the comparative advantages of <b>mutuals</b> (<b>non</b> profit) and insurance companies (for profit), two forms of private institutions involved in health insurance, focusing on the long term aspects of this activity. The conclusion insists on the limits of the analysis, and suggests paths for future research.

Widmann, C. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2001 - 08 Molecular and Cellular Biology 21165346 - 58 <![CDATA[Activation of caspases 3 and 9 is thought to commit a cell irreversibly to apoptosis. There are, however, several documented situations (e. g., during erythroblast differentiation) in which caspases are activated and caspase substrates are cleaved with no associated apoptotic response. Why the cleavage of caspase substrates leads to cell death in certain cases but not in others is unclear. One possibility is that some caspase substrates generate antiapoptotic signals when cleaved. Here we show that RasGAP is one such protein. Caspases cleave RasGAP into a C-terminal fragment (fragment C) and an N-terminal fragment (fragment N). Fragment C expressed alone induces apoptosis, but this effect could be totally blocked by fragment N. Fragment N could also block apoptosis induced by low levels of caspase 9. As caspase activity increases, fragment N is further cleaved into fragments N 1 and N 2. Apoptosis induced by high levels of caspase 9 or by cisplatin was strongly potentiated by fragment N 1 or N 2 but not by fragment N. The present study supports a model in which RasGAP functions as a sensor of caspase activity {{to determine whether or not}} a cell should survive. When caspases are mildly activated, the partial cleavage of RasGAP protects cells from apoptosis. When caspase activity reaches levels that allow completion of RasGAP cleavage, the resulting RasGAP fragments turn into potent proapoptotic molecules...|$|R

40|$|John C. Bogle, {{the founder}} of the Vanguard Group, has long insisted on the superiority of index funds over {{actively}} managed mutual funds and the foolishness of attempts to time the market. He published two articles in the Journal of Portfolio Management showing that in eight out of nine style <b>categories,</b> managed <b>mutual</b> funds had lower risk-adjusted returns than the corresponding indexes did. While this demonstrates the failure of stock picking by mutual funds to serve investors well, it says nothing about their ability to time the market by changing styles. Managers of asset allocation funds often use a flexible combination of stocks, bonds, and cash; some, but not all, shift assets frequently based on analysis of business-cycle trends. To test his view of market timing, we evaluated the returns of 82 major asset allocation funds by comparing them with the returns of corresponding baskets of Vanguard’s index funds over a 13 -year time span. We find that on average the index funds have higher risk-adjusted returns. We conclude that “simplicity is the ultimate sophistication” applies to mutual fund investments. Honor Thesi...|$|R

The sample includes 124 equity funds, bond funds and money market funds that traded in the 2004 - 2011 period. A comprehensive set of fund-specific characteristics, never used before in conjunction in the literature, was considered. The methodology which was adopted had two distinct phases.

Secondly, the fund performance, measured by the Jensen’s alpha, was used in a multi-factor model with panel data in which the independent variables were the fund attributes.

By doing so, we can calculate the composition-invariable part of the country difference of the linkage strength, which is necessary to clarify the second hypothesis.|$|R

Further, money market mutual funds, which hold $ 2. 7 trillion as of September 2013, are now {{a major part of}} the cash economy in the U. S. Accordingly, the flow of money to and from different <b>mutual</b> fund <b>categories</b> (e. g., equities vs. money funds) increasingly reflects the sentiment or risk aversion of the general population. In this study, we analyze flows between different <b>categories</b> of <b>mutual</b> funds, and find strong evidence of a seasonality in risk aversion of individual investors. Specifically, we find that aggregate investor flow data reveals an investor preference for U. S. money market and government bond mutual funds in the autumn, and equity funds in the spring, controlling for the influence of seasonality in past performance, advertising, liquidity needs, and capital gains overhang on fund flows. This movement of large amounts of money between fund categories is correlated with a proxy for variation in investor risk aversion across the seasons, consistent with investors' revealed preferences for safer investments in the fall, and riskier investments in the spring. We find similar evidence in Canadian mutual fund flows, and in flows among Australian funds, where the seasons are six months out of phase relative to Canada and the U. S. While prior evidence regarding the influence of seasonally changing risk aversion on financial markets relies on seasonal patterns in asset returns, we provide the first direct trade-related evidence...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to test how landscape spatial pattern could affect soundscape perception.

The results show that urban soundscapes were characterised by artificial sounds (human, mechanical and traffic sounds) overwhelming the natural ones (biological and geophysical sounds). Major sound <b>categories</b> were normally <b>mutual</b> exclusive and dynamic on temporal scale, and have different spatial distribution on spatial scale. However, biological and traffic sounds seem to be co-existing on both temporal and spatial scales. Significant relationships were found existing between perception of major sound categories and a number of landscape spatial pattern indices, among which vegetation density (NDVI), landscape shape index (LSI) and largest patch index (LPI) showed the most effective indicating ability.

40|$|The book {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} relationships between gender and power. Although the subject has been analysed on many occassions and {{in a variety of}} fashions, the volume does not duplicate the well-known views, but points to the limitations of the previous approaches and suggests possibilities of overcoming those. For the authors of the featured texts, gender also denotes sex in the biological sense, while power does not mean the omnipotent techniques of control, but also strategies of active resistance and emancipation. Having applied a different interpretative paradigm, the authors pose new questions to the already known research material: How to define the category of gender/sex in today's (trans) gender world? In what way do the deliberations on the nature and essence of power affect gender? Do men and women function equally within the machinery of power, assuming the roles of clearly defined cogs, i. e. the dominant (men) and the dominated (women) ones? Answering such questions requires a broad perspective, ranging from antiquity, when power was “invented” by being attributing one gender (though not without exceptions) and when the canon of speaking of what is “female” and “male” was devised, to the contemporary times, in which both <b>categories</b> and their <b>mutual</b> relationships undergo radical reevaluation.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} mutual funds {{have stated that}} the Sharpe ratio is an {{inappropriate}} performance measure as it penalizes upside and downside risk equally and assumes that return series are normally distributed which is rarely the case especially in emerging markets such as Malaysia. To mitigate the flaws of the Sharpe ratio it has been proposed to use Value at Risk (VaR) as the risk metric. When normal VaR (VaRN) is used which only penalizes for downside risk the resulting ratio {{is known as the}} adjusted Sharpe ratio (ASRN). However, this ratio still assumes that returns are normally distributed. Consequently, to account for the <b>non</b> normality of <b>mutual</b> fund returns the modified VaR (MSRN) which accounts for both skewness and heavy tails is used and the resulting ratio is known as the modified Sharpe ratio (MSRG). Nevertheless, studies on Malaysian mutual fund performance have continued to use the Sharpe ratio as a measure of <b>mutual</b> fund performance and <b>non</b> have used the ASR or MSR. To fill this gap this study aims to analyse the performance of Malaysian mutual funds using MSR. We also analyse fund performance using SR and ASR to see whether these different performance measures produce different rankings. Hence, employing the daily NAV of 24 Malaysian mutual funds from 1998 to 2007 and using the KLCI as the benchmark we first estimate the VaRN, and the VaRG at the 95 % and 99 % confidence levels. Consequently we compute the SR, ASRN and MSRG. We find that the VaRN underestimates the risk exposure and consequently the ASRN overestimates performance when compared to the VaRG and the MSRG respectively. Nonetheless the ASRN and the MSRG produced the same rankings. Furthermore the SR produced the same rankings as the ASRN and the MSRG for 16 out of the 24 mutual funds analysed in this study. As for the eight funds that experienced a rank change the change was slight. Hence we {{come to the conclusion that}} the Sharpe ratio is adequate for purposes of ranking mutual funds...|$|R
