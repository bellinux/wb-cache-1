50|$|Fusain is a fossilised <b>carbon</b> <b>deposit</b> which, {{after some}} controversy, has been {{identified}} as fossilised charcoal. It is fibrous, black and opaque, and often preserves details of cell wall architecture. Wood-derived fusain usually takes the form of cubic blocks, whereas fusain from other plant material may take the form of thin films which are only visible under a microscope where the surrounding rock is dissolved by acid maceration. The material is silky and crumbles on the touch.The loss of volatile elements during combustion means that fusain fossils are usually smaller than the original organism, but this same factor makes them unlikely to be eaten by any animals (for they have no nutritional value), enhancing their preservation potential.|$|E
50|$|Diesel engines {{can produce}} black soot (or more {{specifically}} diesel particulate matter) from their exhaust. The black smoke consists of carbon compounds {{that have not}} burned because of local low temperatures where the fuel is not fully atomized. These local low temperatures occur at the cylinder walls, and at the surface of large droplets of fuel. At these areas where it is relatively cold, the mixture is rich (contrary to the overall mixture which is lean). The rich mixture has less air to burn {{and some of the}} fuel turns into a <b>carbon</b> <b>deposit.</b> Modern car engines use a diesel particulate filter (DPF) to capture carbon particles and then intermittently burn them using extra fuel injected directly into the filter. This prevents carbon buildup at the expense of wasting a small quantity of fuel.|$|E

40|$|The chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) and chemical-looping reforming (CLR) processes allow combustion to {{take place}} in fuel gases such as CH 4 to generate energy and produce H 2, impeding the emission of CO 2 into the atmosphere and contributing to greenhouse mitigation. In this work, the effect of adding water steam to CH 4 was investigated, using NiO/alpha-Al 2 O 3 and NiAl 2 O 4 /gamma-Al 2 O 3 as oxygen carriers in order to reduce or eliminate the formation of <b>carbon</b> <b>deposits</b> on these materials when using long reductions steps. After characterizing the oxygen carriers using different techniques, they underwent many redox sequences, proving themselves to be stable. However, when CH 4 was employed as the only active component of the reaction mixture in argon, large <b>carbon</b> <b>deposits</b> were formed on both carriers. The <b>carbon</b> <b>deposits</b> were only removed by a subsequent oxidation step using oxygen in argon. In experiments carried out in which water steam was added to the CH 4 during the reduction step, <b>carbon</b> <b>deposits</b> on NiAl 2 O 4 /gamma-Al 2 O 3 were almost eliminated and on NiO/alpha-Al 2 O 3 were totally eliminated. Since the results were different, two different reaction mechanisms were proposed: the first in which the addition of H 2 O impeded the formation of <b>carbon</b> <b>deposits</b> and the second in which the carbon formed was gasified by the water. Both of the mechanisms were evaluated thermodynamically and experimentally for each of the steps involved. It can be asserted {{that in the case of}} the NiO/alpha-Al 2 O 3 oxygen carrier, the second mechanism is much more probable since it involves quick and irreversible steps and in which water steam acts directly on the <b>carbon</b> <b>deposits.</b> In the case of the NiAl 2 O 4 /gamma-Al 2 O 3 carrier, both of the mechanisms are possible. Because they involve reversible reactions they dont result in the total elimination of <b>carbon</b> <b>deposits,</b> though the level of elimination is quite high. Pages: 1 - 1...|$|R

40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) are {{promising}} electrochemical energy converting devices {{due to their}} ability to use not only hydrogen but also hydrocarbons as a fuel. Although conventional SOFCs with Ni/YSZ anodes and hydrocarbon fuels form <b>carbon</b> <b>deposits</b> that inhibit SOFC performance, an enhancement in performance is observed for the Cu/CeO 2 /YSZ anode with <b>carbon</b> <b>deposits</b> and H 2 fuel. Structural and compositional analyses of these <b>carbon</b> <b>deposits</b> show that graphitic carbon forms on the Cu/CeO 2 /YSZ. The reason of the 2 to 3 fold enhancement in performance is due to increase in anode conductivity by graphitic <b>carbon</b> <b>deposits.</b> An important problem for fuel oxidation kinetics on SOFC anodes is determining the rate limiting step(s) for fuel oxidation.
