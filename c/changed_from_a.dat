The firm <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> corporation to a share company in 1965, and changed its name from Ethiopian Air Lines to Ethiopian Airlines. By 1966, the contractual relationship with TWA was adjusted to reflect the transfer of management with the appointment of an Ethiopian deputy general manager. Two Boeing 720s were in operation and a Boeing 707-320C was due to be phased in by , when the carrier ordered a second -320C.|$|E
5|$|RNA is {{transcribed}} {{with only}} four bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil), but these bases and attached sugars {{can be modified}} in numerous ways as the RNAs mature. Pseudouridine (Ψ), in which the linkage between uracil and ribose is <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> C–N bond to a C–C bond, and ribothymidine (T) are found in various places (the most notable ones being in the TΨC loop of tRNA). Another notable modified base is hypoxanthine, a deaminated adenine base whose nucleoside is called inosine (I). Inosine {{plays a key role}} in the wobble hypothesis of the genetic code.|$|E

In the 2000s, the hospital was <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> primary and secondary care to a specialized tertiary care center, receiving complex cases from other hospitals and clinics in the region, but around 60% of patients in the hospital are still cases that could be handled by local health centers.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural {{edition of}} the Echo was printed in Press Lane, Sunderland on 22 December 1873; 1,000 copies were {{produced}} and sold for a halfpenny each. The Echo survived intense competition in its early years, {{as well as the}} depression of the 1930s and two World Wars. Sunderland was heavily bombed in the Second World War and, although the Echo building was undamaged, it was forced to print its competitor's paper under wartime rules. It was during this time that the paper's format <b>changed,</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> broadsheet to its current tabloid layout, because of national newsprint shortages.|$|E

5|$|AFIS {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to call up}} the aircraft. It {{received a call from}} a resident close to Torghatten which said they had heard aircraft noise followed by a crash. Brønnøysund Fire Department and an ambulance helicopter with a doctor was dispatched to Torghatten. The rescue work was made difficult by low clouds, small fires and explosions. The terrain was difficult and the lack of daylight made assisting the situation difficult. A helicopter with medical personnel and the airport direct arrived at 21:25, while a meeting place for the next of kin was established at the airport. At 23:30 the police stated that there was no hope of finding survivors and the scene <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> search to an investigation scene. Due to the fog {{it was not possible to}} verify that all people had been killed until the next day. Seventy-five soldiers from the Home Guard participated in the salvage.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} two adaptations, both done by Clark, the tales were adapted {{by a number of}} playwrights and screenwriters. In most {{instances}} the adaptations alter the original source material. For example, A Warning to the Curious frequently deviates from its literary source. The screenplay avoids the convoluted plot structure of M. R. James's original, opting for a more linear construction and reducing the number of narrators. In addition the central character, Paxton, is <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> young fair-haired innocent who stumbles across the treasure to a middle-aged character driven by poverty to seek the treasure and acting in full awareness of what he is doing.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{the history}} of the National League (94 years), the pennant was {{presented}} to the team with the best win–loss record at the end of the season. The first modern World Series was played in 1903, and after a hiatus in 1904, continued until 1994, when a players' strike forced the cancellation of the postseason, and resumed in 1995. In 1969, the league split into two divisions, and the teams with the best records in each division played one another in the NLCS to determine the pennant winner. The format of the NLCS was <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> best-of-five to a best-of-seven format for the 1985 postseason. In 1995, an additional playoff series was added when Major League Baseball restructured the two divisions in each league into three. , the winners of the Eastern, Central, and Western Divisions, as well as one wild card team, play in the National League Division Series, a best-of-five playoff to determine the opponents who will play for the pennant.|$|E

5|$|In 1909 the {{newspaper}} La Gazzetta dello Sport established the Giro d'Italia, {{inspired by the}} success of the Tour de France, which started in 1903. The first Giro was won by Luigi Ganna, while Carlo Galetti won the two following Giros. In 1912, there was no individual classification, instead there was only a team classification, which was won by Team Atala. The 1912 Giro is the only time the competition has not had an individual classification. From 1914 onwards the scoring format was <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> points-based system to a time-based system, in which the cyclist who had the lowest aggregate time {{at the end of the}} race would win. The Giro was suspended for four years from 1915 to 1918, due to the First World War. Costante Girardengo was the winner of the first Giro after the war in 1919.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{the league}} {{split into two}} {{division}}s, and the teams with the best records in each division played {{one another in the}} five-game ALCS to determine the pennant winner, who received (and continues to receive) the William Harridge Trophy. The trophy features a golden eagle, the league's emblem, sitting atop a silver baseball and clutching the American League banner. The trophy is named for Will Harridge, who was league president from 1931 to 1958. The format of the ALCS was <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> best-of-five to a best-of-seven format in the 1985 postseason.

5|$|In 1984, Norsk Flytjenesete started {{negotiations}} with the Sandefjord-based conglomerate Kosmos, who were seeking {{to invest in a}} local airline. Kosmos had decided to start a diversification strategy to spread their risk. Norsk Flytjeneste was at the time not making money on its routes, but Kosmos was willing to carry the loss as an investment. The airline was sold to Kosmos on 15 April 1985. At the time of the take-over, Norsk Flytjeneste had four Cessna 310s and one Piper Navajo. The airline's seven-passenger Beechcraft 200 and C90 King Airs were already owned by Kosmos. The company was <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> sole propriatoriship to a limited company.

5|$|Like most film {{adaptations of}} Dick's works, {{many aspects of}} his story were changed in their {{transition}} to film, such as the addition of Lamar Burgess and the change in setting from New York City to Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Northern Virginia. The character of John Anderton was <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> balding and out-of-shape old man to an athletic officer in his 40s to fit its portrayer and the film's action scenes. The film adds two stories of tragic families; Anderton's, {{and that of the}} three pre-cogs. In the short story, Anderton is married with no children, while in the film, he is the divorced father of a kidnapped son, who is most likely deceased. Although it is implied, but unclear in the film whether Agatha is related to the twin pre-cogs, her family was shattered when Burgess murdered her mother, Anne Lively. The precogs were intellectually disabled and deformed individuals in the story, but in the film, they are the genetically mutated offspring of drug addicts. Anderton's future murder and the reasons for the conspiracy were <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> general who wants to discredit PreCrime to regain some military funding, to a man who murdered a precog's mother to preserve PreCrime. The subsequent murders and plot developed from this change. The film's ending also differs from the short story's. In Dick's story, Anderton prevents the closure of the PreCrime division, however, in the movie Anderton successfully brings {{about the end of the}} organization. Other aspects were updated to include current technology. For instance in the story, Anderton uses a punch card machine to interpret the precogs' visions; in the movie, he uses a virtual reality interface.|$|E
5|$|Māori quickly adopted {{writing as}} a means of sharing ideas, and many of their oral stories and poems were {{converted}} to the written form. Most early English literature was obtained from Britain and {{it was not until the}} 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to become widely known. Although still largely influenced by global trends (modernism) and events (the Great Depression), writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand. During this period literature <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> journalistic activity to a more academic pursuit. Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers a new perspective on New Zealand culture and with the post-war expansion of universities local literature flourished. Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the San Juan Basin saw {{plentiful}} rainfall {{during the}} 5th to 8th centuries, leading to significant expansion of pit-house communities. Population increases during the 6th century {{led to the}} settlement of the area's lowlands, including Chaco Canyon, as the Basketmaker II people <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> primarily hunter-gatherer society to one based on farming. This culture is known as Basketmaker III, and by 500 at least two such settlements had been established in Chaco Canyon. An important phase of Basketmaker III people {{is known as the}} La Plata. One of the earliest La Plata phase sites, Shabik'eshchee Village, was continuously occupied until the early 8th century, when the canyon was home to a few hundred people. Several clusters of Basketmaker III sites have been identified in the vicinity of Chetro Ketl.|$|E
