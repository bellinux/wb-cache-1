5000|$|The {{boiler house}} had three Lancashire boilers working at [...] per square inch. Each boiler was 30 ft by 7 ft, with {{internal}} flues 33 in in diameter, with five <b>cross-tubes.</b>|$|R
50|$|These boilers {{were not}} common, owing to {{drawbacks}} with excessive wear in service. The more {{common form of}} vertical boiler, which was very similar in external appearance, instead used a single flue and water-filled <b>cross-tubes.</b> Another form used horizontal fire-tubes, even where this added complexity, such as the Cochran boiler.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{evaporative}} {{surface is}} provided {{by a pair of}} large water-filled <b>cross-tubes</b> across this firebox and directly exposed to the radiant heat of the fire. As these tubes are large in diameter they remain mostly filled with water, rather than filling with steam, and so the boiler is not classed amongst the usual water-tube boilers. These tubes are horizontal, or slightly inclined so as to encourage circulation in a single direction without turbulence.|$|R
50|$|The twin unstepped main floats {{were carried}} by a two struts {{attached}} to the front <b>cross-tube</b> and two pairs of struts {{attached to the}} rear <b>cross-tube,</b> both cross-tubes being arched in the middle to accommodate the torpedo crutches.

50|$|Most undertype wagons used {{water-tube}} boilers. Many manufacturers used {{variants of}} the vertical <b>cross-tube</b> boiler, including Atkinson, Clayton, Garrett and Sentinel. Other types include the Clarkson 'thimble tube' and the Foden O-type wagon's pistol-shaped boiler.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>cross-tube</b> boiler was {{the most}} common form of small {{vertical}} boiler. They were widely used, in the age of steam, as a small donkey boiler, for the independent power of winches, steam cranes etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{project was}} started in October 1989 with the {{prototype}} first flying in June 1994 originally with a single engine. It was later rebuilt with two Hirth F30A two-stroke engines.The lifting vehicle is an open frame with one person standing on top with a protective tubular framework. Below the framework the vehicle has two coaxial contra-rotating two-blade rotors with directional control from two small propellers {{at the ends of}} the <b>cross-tubes.</b> It has a fixed skid landing gear.|$|R
2500|$|The {{suspension}} also automatically accommodates differing payloads in the car- {{with four}} people and cargo {{on board the}} wheelbase increases by around 4cm (2in) as the suspension deflects, and the castor angle of the front wheels increases {{by as much as}} 8 degrees thus ensuring that ride quality, handling and road holding are almost unaffected by the additional weight. On early cars friction dampers (like a dry version of a multi-plate clutch design) were fitted at the mountings of the front and rear swinging arms to the <b>cross-tubes.</b> Because the rear brakes were outboard, they had extra tuned mass dampers to damp wheel bounce from the extra unsprung mass. Later models had tuned mass dampers ("batteurs") at the front (because the leading arm had more inertia and [...] "bump/thump" [...] than the trailing arm), with hydraulic telescopic dampers / shock absorbers front and rear. The uprated hydraulic damping obviated the need for the rear inertia dampers. It was designed to be a comfortable ride by matching the frequencies encountered in human bipedal motion.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999 Dynacraft voluntarily {{recalled}} about 3,000 Magna [...] "Great Divide" [...] 21 speed mountain bikes, {{sold in the}} 24-inch {{size for}} girls and boys, and the 26-inch size for women and men. The bikes could have defective handle bar stems which would not tighten sufficiently to lock onto the bicycles. This can cause the front wheel not to turn properly, resulting in serious injuries to the rider from falls. Dynacraft stated that is {{not aware of any}} injuries or incidents involving these bicycles. The bikes have a model number {{on the left side of}} the seat post. The girls' bikes have model number 8504-50 and are purple. The boys' bikes have model number 8504-51 and are blue. The women's bikes have model number 8547-84 and also are purple. The men's bikes have model number 8547-85 and are black. The words [...] "Great Divide" [...] are located on the <b>cross-tubes</b> of these bicycles and the word [...] "KALLOY" [...] is located on the handlebar stems. Fred Meyer Stores in Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Washington sold these bikes from December 1998 through August 18, 1999.|$|R
50|$|Circulation in boilers {{is largely}} due to the {{thermosyphon}} effect, which is encouraged by the vertical rise of the water-tubes. As the simple <b>cross-tube</b> boiler has near-horizontal tubes, circulation is poor. To improve this, designs such as the Clarke Chapman 'Tyne' boiler used steeply angled main tubes and small vertical tubes at the sides. This improved circulation, although it made washout difficult.|$|E
50|$|A typical large {{stationary}} engine {{of this time}} used a number of lancashire boilers, set in brickwork surrounds. These took a considerable time to build their masonry, let alone install the equipment. The vertical <b>cross-tube</b> boilers used for small portable machinery such as steam cranes had much less steam generation capacity and could only run at full power intermittently. Locomotive boilers though, as used here, had greater capacity and could provide a mechanical plant that could run continuously for long periods. Robey also built some examples, around 1886, with launch-type boilers.|$|E
50|$|Simply {{designed}} with single top and down tubes, the Venom's heavy brazed-lug frame (which had clear origins in bicycle manufacture) was well proven for its handling capability. At the rear {{was an unusual}} swinging arm design with two separate arms clamped to a <b>cross-tube</b> instead of the traditional welded-section rear fork. Although this was effective, {{it was difficult to}} set up the horizontal alignment. The rear shock absorbers were originally made by Woodhead Monroe, then replaced by Armstrong units and eventually Girling shocks. These could easily be adjusted to suit the rider's preference by moving them in special curved slots. The front telescopic forks, designed by Velocette and manufactured in-house, had hydraulic damping and an offset wheel spindle.|$|E

50|$|Where {{the boiler}} was {{arranged}} for composite firing, the central flue version was used with oil firing. Fired boilers sometimes included vertical water-tubes of more conventional form as well, to improve circulation. There {{could even be}} cross-tubes, as for the common vertical <b>cross-tube</b> boiler. A common form for ships had both inner and outer flues, with separate gas circuits for each; the inner used for oil firing and the outer for exhaust heat-recovery. This avoided problems of exhaust blowback into the oil-fired flue. Another composite form for ships used two boilers: one of minimal form with a central flue, used as a silencer economizer for the diesel engines, and another as a purely oil-fired central flue boiler. The economizer was used with pumped circulation (as it was usually mounted high up) as a feedwater heater. This system was used where {{a large amount of}} steam was required even when in port, such as for heated cargoes like banana boats and passenger liners.|$|E
5000|$|The Montego, Five Hundred and Ford Freestyle were {{manufactured}} using a Volvo-derived {{system called}} Total Vehicle Geometry (TVG) to ensure fit, finish and craftsmanship [...] - [...] by requiring comprehensive participation by all engineers {{as well as}} suppliers and vendors. Heavily using computer-aided design, TVG tracks all design modifications, translating them into the central CAD database which in turn allows each engineer access to current project data. The system improves part tolerance at the body-in-white stage as well as early cabin integrity testing, via air leakage testing. TVG improved fit and finish at the first prototype stage and decreases pilot manufacturing times. [...] For side impact protection the bodywork is braced at the B-pillar via an energy-channeling structural cross-car roof tube and a corresponding undercar energy channelling <b>cross-tube</b> [...] - [...] with the front seats mounted above the lower tube, locating them above a side impact energy path. The system derives from a side-impact safety design marketed by Volvo as its Side Impact Protection System (SIPS).|$|E
5000|$|The Tattershall District was the {{earliest}} {{to obtain an}} Act of Parliament, which it did in 1796. After enclosure, it was drained by a wind engine, but this {{was replaced by a}} steam engine with a 24 ft scoop wheel in 1855. The engine was a [...] beam engine, manufactured by Bradley & Craven Ltd of Wakefield. Steam was generated by a Cornish boiler, which was replaced by a Foster boiler in 1909. The engine house originally had a 100 ft chimney, but this was struck by lightning in 1922, after which it was shortened. It was demolished in 1941, soon after a new pumping station was built, housing a Ruston diesel engine and a 22 in Gwynnes pump. This has been superseded by an electric pumping station, but is still maintained by the Third District as a backup. The steam and diesel engines are cared for by the Dogdyke Pumping Station Preservation Trust, and the station is opened to the public several times a year, when the engines are operational. The boiler was replaced by a Clayton <b>cross-tube</b> vertical boiler in 1976, and replaced again in 2001. The buildings are Grade II listed and scheduled ancient monuments.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{many other}} RFC and French combat aircraft, the Nieuport 17 used an {{arrangement}} of Le Prieur rockets mounted obliquely to the interplane struts, designed for [...] "stand off" [...] balloon attacks. The concept of off-set or oblique mounted weaponry in night fighting was first used by Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c night fighters, to attack airships from below. RFC/RAF specialized [...] "Comic" [...] Home Defence night fighter variants of the Sopwith 1½ Strutter and Sopwith Camels of No. 151 Squadron RAF in 1918, were produced to combat German bomber and airship raids over Great Britain. The armament of two Lewis guns was mounted on twin Foster mountings, in preference to the synchronized Vickers preferred for day fighting. These were located at the upper center-section or fixed to fire upwards in a position that both eliminated the need for 'deflection' shooting and prevented the pilot from losing night vision from the flash of the firing guns.The Sopwith Dolphin, a [...] "multi-gun" [...] fighter design which entered service {{near the end of}} World War I, was armed with two forward-firing Vickers machine guns in the usual location, just forward of the cockpit, but could also carry a pair of Lewis machine guns on the forward <b>cross-tube</b> of the cabane strut structure, aimed forwards and upwards, as an anti-Zeppelin armament scheme, and were so equipped on delivery from the makers. The Germans tried similar arrangements in 1917, when Gerhard Fieseler of Jasta 38 attached two machine guns to an Albatros D.V, pointing upwards and forwards.|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the possibility of}} making conductive and dry adhesive interfaces between multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) and nanofiber (MWNF) arrays grown by chemical vapor deposition with transition-metal as catalyst on highly Boron doped silicon substrates. The maximum observed adhesion force between MWNT and MWNF surfaces is 3. 5 mN for an apparent contact area of 2 mm by 4 mm. The minimum contact resistance measured {{at the same time}} is approx. 20 Omega. Contact resistances of MWNT-MWNT and MWNT-gold interfaces were also measured as pressure forces around several mN were applied at the interface. The resulting minimum contact resistances are on the same order but with considerable variation from sample to sample. For MWNT-MWNT contacts, a minimum contact resistance of approx. 1 Omega is observed for a contact area of 2 mm by 1 mm. The relatively high contact resistances, considering the area density of the nanotubes, might be explained by the high <b>cross-tube</b> resistances at the contact interfaces...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} the {{fretting}} wear in steam generator tubes of Incoloy® 800 {{in contact with}} AISI 304, AISI 1060 and Cu (99, 9 %) pads acting in a <b>cross-tube</b> geometry was studied. Wear surface was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the resulting debris were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). It was verified that in all cases, the fretting conditions corresponded to gross slip. A predominance of adhesive wear was found for Cu and AISI 1060 while abrasive wear was predominant {{in the case of}} AISI 304. It was determined that the higher the hardness of the pad material the lower the surface damage (case of the AISI 1060). Analysis of debris allowed the identification non-stoichiometric oxide phases with either a spinel structure of the type FeCr 2 O 4. Fe 3 O 4 and a hematite (Fe,Cr) 2 O 3 in the case of AISI 304, while for Cu and AISI 1060 pads, the presence of CuFe 2 O 4 spinel and (Fe,Cr) 2 O 3 hematite were observed, respectively. The formation of spinel structures originates in an effect of mechanical alloying between the surfaces. Debris particle size distribution was found to extend in the range from tens of nanometers to few micrometers with the larger particles consisting in agglomerates of crystallites with sizes between 5 and 20 nm...|$|E
30|$|Titania nanotubes— 1 D {{nanostructures}} {{with a high}} {{specific surface}} area—have been designed {{for a number of}} potential applications [39]. Titania nanotubes can be synthesized by various methods including hydrothermal [40] and electrochemical anodization [39, 40], chemical processing [41], rapid breakdown anodization (RBA) [42], and template-assisted and electrospinning methods [40]. Thermal conductivity in the range of 0.40 – 0.84  W m− 1  K− 1 [1] and 0.55 – 0.75  W m− 1  K− 1 [33] have been observed for titanate nanotubes synthesized by the hydrothermal process. Brahmi et al. [32] reported a thermal conductivity of 0.85  W m− 1  K− 1 for a single amorphous nanotube and 1.5  W m− 1  K− 1 for anatase titania nanotube prepared by electrochemical anodization. On the other hand, the detached titania nanotube arrays were reported to have a thermal conductivity of 0.617  W m− 1  K− 1 along the tube direction for amorphous and 1.12  W m− 1  K− 1 for anatase nanotubes [34]. The <b>cross-tube</b> amorphous thermal conductivity was 0.077 – 0.1024  W m− 1  K− 1 for amorphous nanotubes and 0.24  W m− 1  K− 1 in the case of crystalline nanotubes [34]. Titania nanotube arrays in these reports are grown on Ti substrate by electrochemical anodization method using organic electrolytes with fluoride ions (third generation of TNTs) with a wall thickness of 30 – 70  nm [32] and 15  nm [34]. The nanotubes prepared by RBA comprises of the fourth generation of TNTs [43], where bundles of titania nanotubes are obtained by utilizing a fluoride-free electrolyte [42].|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of large-scale desalination {{plants in the}} Arab Gulf area employ the multistage flash (MSF) processes. MSF processes are energy intensive and it is, therefore, essential to search for design and operating conditions which lead to reduction of energy dissipation and consequently lower water production cost. This paper reports a simulation study which was carried out to examine {{to what extent the}} thermal irreversibility of an MSF process is influenced by variation of the most important design and operating parameters. The impact of variation of top brine temperature, number of stages and terminal temperature approach on the distiller performance ratio and irreversibility were explored and presented graphically in the term of thermal grids. The simulation study revealed that within the selected range of number of stages (16 - 40) and top brine temperature (90 120 oC), the MSF distiller irreversibility is highly influenced by the number of stages {{and to a lesser extent}} by the variation of the top brine temperature. The simulated results are compared with one year operating data obtained from an MSF distiller. The distiller is a <b>cross-tube</b> configuration, which consists of 22 stages and operating at a top brine temperature ranging between 90 to 98 oC. Using a steady state simulation program, an envelop of possible operating conditions is constructed for the distiller to interrelate performance ratio, production, recycle flow and top brine temperature. Stage-wise simulation of individual heat transfer coefficients and fouling factors showed that both clean overall heat transfer coefficients (Uc) and fouling factors (FF) are stage dependent and conversely the operating overall heat transfe...|$|E
40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} area, the laser has attracted increasing attention in recent {{year as an}} important tool {{in the practice of}} micro/nano scale manufacturing, such as surface microfabrication and processing, pulsed laser deposition of films and coatings, laser machining of metals and non-metallic materials, and laser surface cleaning. During the laser assisted nanostructuring process, intensive heating will cause the material to experience fast phase change that the non-equilibrium state will lead to shock wave near the heating spot. In nanostructures, thermal movements of molecules/atoms show strong statistical variations in space since the equilibrium state cannot be established. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, which directly tracks the movements of molecules/atoms, is capable of exploring physical phenomena down to molecular/atomic levels and predicting processes under different conditions. The previous work done in our group have investigated the evolution of density, temperature, pressure, and shock wave front Mach number. Chapter 2 is an introduction to the basics of MD simulation. In chapter 3, the evolution of the interaction zone and energy exchange between the plume and the ambient gas are studied with respect to different gas/solid molecular mass ratios and different ambient gas densities. The evolutions of shock wave front position as well as velocity and Mach number in different ambient gases are also studied. Lasers also have wide spread popularity in characterization physical properties of materials. When illuminating the surface of materials, the laser light can be absorbed by the material and cause the temperature and thermal radiation variation at the surface. These phenomena have been intensively studied in the past. A photothermal (PT) technique has been developed in our group for characterizing thermal physical properties of different materials. For the thermal properties characterization of amorphous titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanotube arrays, this technique provides the experimental data of the as-prepared sample density and the thermal conductivity along the tube length direction. The thermal conductivity in the <b>cross-tube</b> direction is measured by the transient electrothermal (TET) technique. Combining the two techniques, the contact resistance between the TiO 2 nanotubes is also investigated. Chapter 4 is for the experimental setup for the studying of nanoscale thermal transport. Chapter 5 analyzes the experimental data in detail and compares with work done by other researchers. The emphasis of future work is outlined and described in Chapter 6...|$|E
