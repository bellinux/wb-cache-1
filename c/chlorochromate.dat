25|$|The acetyl {{group in}} 6.1 (Scheme 6) was removed to give primary alcohol 6.2.

25|$|The Cornforth reagent (pyridinium dichromate, PDC), pyridinium <b>chlorochromate</b> (PCC), the Collins reagent (complex of chromium(VI) oxide with {{pyridine}} in dichloromethane) and the Sarret reagent (complex of chromium(VI) oxide with pyridine in pyridine) {{are similar}} chromium-based pyridine compounds, {{which are also}} used for oxidation, namely conversion of primary and secondary alcohols to ketones. The Collins and Sarret reagents are both difficult and dangerous to prepare, they are hygroscopic and can inflame during preparation. For this reason, the use of PCC and PDC was preferred. Those reagents were rather popular in the 1970s and 1980s, but because of their toxicity and confirmed carcinogenic status, they are rarely used nowadays.|$|E
50|$|Hexavalent {{chromium}} compounds (including chromium trioxide, {{chromic acid}}s, chromates, <b>chlorochromates)</b> are toxic and carcinogenic. For this reason, chromic acid oxidation {{is not used}} on an industrial scale except in the aerospace industry.|$|R
25|$|Many oxidating agents {{can be used}} as {{alternatives}} to oxoammonium oxidants. Activated manganese dioxide, which is able to oxidize only allylic, benzylic, or other activated positions, is cheaper than TEMPO and operationally simple to use. Chromium-based reagents such as pyridinium <b>chlorochromate</b> {{can also be used to}} convert alcohols to carbonyl compounds; although the mechanism of chromium oxidations is well understood, the stoichiometric generation of chromium wastes is a disadvantage of this class of oxidants. Oxidations employing dimethyl sulfoxide, such as the Swern and Moffatt reactions, involve no heavy metals and oxidize a wide variety of substrates. However, the unpleasant odor generated during these reactions (dimethyl sulfide) is often cited as a disadvantage. Oxoammonium oxidations are preferred to DMSO methods for reactions of diols and acetylenic alcohols. Dess-Martin periodinane is a highly selective, mild oxidant of alcohols, whose primary disadvantages are difficulties with preparation and safety.|$|E

50|$|The {{double bond}} is reduced with {{hydrazine}} and sequential diisobutylaluminum hydride reduction and pyridinium <b>chlorochromate</b> oxidation of 21 forms the aldehyde 22. A second Norrish reaction then adds another C-C bond to alcohol 23 and having served its purpose the phenoxy tail is removed in several steps: a Birch reduction to diol 24, oxidation with pyridinium <b>chlorochromate</b> to ketoaldehyde 25 and a reverse Claisen condensation to ketone 26. A third Norrish reaction produces alcohol 27 {{and a second}} dehydration 28 and another reduction 29 {{at which point the}} synthesis is left completely without functional groups. The missing C-C bond is put in place by hydrogen pressurized dehydrogenation with palladium on carbon at 250 °C to dodecahedrane 30.|$|E
50|$|Oxidation with chromium(VI)-amine {{complexes}} {{involves the}} conversion of alcohols to carbonyl compounds or more highly oxidized products through the action of chromium(VI) oxide-amine adducts and salts.

50|$|In its {{chemical}} structure and functions, the Cornforth reagent {{is closely related}} to other pyridinium salts of hexavalent chromium oxide, such as pyridinium <b>chlorochromate</b> PyHCrO3Cl and to pyridine complexes such as the Collins reagent, CrO3·2Py in dichloromethane and the Sarret reagent, CrO3·2Py in pyridine.|$|E
5000|$|Potassium <b>chlorochromate</b> can be toxic upon {{ingestion}} (may cause {{acute poisoning}} and kidney damage amongst other complications) or {{contact with the}} human skin (may cause eye burns, irritation, allergy, or ulceration), especially if inhalated.

50|$|The {{catalyst}} {{is formed}} by reaction with acetone under basic conditions, with the hydroxyl {{groups of the}} fructose ring acting as nucleophiles, their nucleophilicity increased by the basic conditions created by potassium carbonate. The electron withdrawing substituents (alpha-ether groups) encourage {{the formation of the}} ketone from the oxidizing agent pyridinium <b>chlorochromate</b> by increasing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, via a stabilizing delocalization of the forming π C-C bonds into the σ* C-O bonds of the adjacent ethers.|$|E
5000|$|The tail {{addition}} {{step in this}} synthesis (Scheme 6) {{was identical}} {{to that in the}} Nicolaou tail addition and was based on Oijma chemistry. The A ring was functionalized with a hydroxyl group through pyridinium <b>chlorochromate</b> oxidation of α-acylketone 49 to form ketone 50. Subsequent reduction using sodium borohydride produced alcohol 51 [...] Reaction of this alcohol with the Ojima lactam 52 and a concluding silyl deprotection step at two triethyl silyl positions in compound 53 gave Taxol.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the longest}} known and most widely used oxo {{compounds}} are oxidizing agents such as potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and osmium tetroxide (OsO4). [...] Compounds such as these are widely used for converting alkenes to vicinal diols and alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids. More selective or gentler oxidizing reagents include pyridinium <b>chlorochromate</b> (PCC) and pyridinium dichromate (PDC). [...] Metal oxo species are capable of catalytic, including asymmetric oxidations of various types. Some metal-oxo complexes promote C-H bond activation, converting hydrocarbons to alcohols.|$|E

50|$|An {{advantage}} of the Oppenauer oxidation is its use of relatively inexpensive and non-toxic reagents. Reaction conditions are mild and gentle since the substrates are generally heated in acetone/benzene mixtures. Another {{advantage of}} the Oppenauer oxidation which makes it unique to other oxidation methods such as pyridinium <b>chlorochromate</b> (PCC) and Dess-Martin periodinane is that secondary alcohols are oxidized much faster than primary alcohols, thus chemoselectivity can be achieved. Furthermore, there is no over oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids as opposed to another oxidation methods such the Jones oxidation.|$|E
50|$|The Cornforth reagent or pyridinium {{dichromate}} (PDC) is a pyridinium salt of dichromate {{with the}} chemical formula C5H5NH2Cr2O7. This compound {{is named after}} the Australian-British chemist Sir John Warcup Cornforth (b. 1917) who introduced it in 1962. The Cornforth reagent is a strong oxidizing agent which can convert primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones respectively. In its chemical structure and functions it {{is closely related to}} other compounds made from hexavalent chromium oxide, such as pyridinium <b>chlorochromate</b> and Collins reagent. Because of their toxicity, these reagents are rarely used nowadays.|$|E
50|$|Sarrett {{identified}} the adduct of pyridine and chromium(VI) oxide (Collins reagent) as a selective compound for the oxidation of {{primary and secondary}} alcohols to carbonyl compounds. Despite its selectivity, Collins reagent suffers from difficulties associated with its preparation, stability, and efficiency. The less reactive adducts pyridinium <b>chlorochromate</b> (PCC) and pyridinium dichromate (PDC) are more easily handled and more selective than Collins reagent in oxidations of alcohols. These reagents, as well as other, more exotic adducts of nitrogen heterocycles with chromium(VI), facilitate a number of oxidative transformations of organic compounds, including cyclization to form tetrahydrofuran derivatives and allylic transposition to afford enones from allylic alcohols.|$|E
