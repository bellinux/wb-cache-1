The nonlinearity of a response to competition is the second derivative of the per-capita growth rate {{with respect to the}} <b>competitive</b> <b>factor</b> , which is zero if the growth response is linear, positive if the response is accelerating (convex), and negative if the response is decelerating (concave). For competition between two species, the greater the difference in the curvatures of their response to changes in a <b>competitive</b> <b>factor,</b> the greater the differences in their overall specialization on <b>competitive</b> <b>factor</b> variation. For example, by Jensen's inequality, compared to constant resource density, variation in a <b>competitive</b> <b>factor</b> has no effect on species with zero curvature, positive effects on species with positive curvature, and negative effects on species with negative curvature. Thus, [...] indicates a species response to variation in competitive factors, a dimension of competition that can be partitioned.|$|E
5000|$|Competitive {{factors are}} best {{thought of as}} {{dimensions}} of the environment that are jointly used {{by more than one}} species and contribute to a reduction in performance of individuals when used. For example, space is a common <b>competitive</b> <b>factor</b> for trees because many species require space for new trees to grow and the reduction in space reduces opportunities for other species to capture that space and grow. Resources and predators have similar properties and count as competitive factors. For competition between two species for a single shared resource, it is easy enough to think of the <b>competitive</b> <b>factor</b> as the reduction in species density due to consumption. In the absence of resource consumption, resources will tend to be at some equilibrium value, K. Thus, the <b>competitive</b> <b>factor</b> for our example is [...] for any value of R.|$|E

40|$|The enzymatic {{conversion}} of mixtures of multiple substrates was studied quantitatively, based on established methodology {{used for the}} enzymatic kinetic resolution of racemic mixtures, involving the use of competitive factors: ratios of specificity constants (k(cat) /K(M)) of substrate pairs. The <b>competitive</b> <b>factors</b> of the substrates were defined {{in relation to a}} reference substrate. These <b>competitive</b> <b>factors</b> were used to predict the composition of the reaction mixture {{as a function of the}} degree of {{conversion of}} the reaction. The methodology was evaluated using three different lipases to hydrolyse a model mixture of four fatty acid methyl esters and for the esterification of a mixture of the same fatty acids in free form with ethanol. In most cases, the <b>competitive</b> <b>factors</b> determined from the initial phase of the reactions predicted the product composition during the rest of the reaction very well. The slowest reacting fatty acid was erucic acid (both in free form and as methyl ester), which was thus enriched in the remaining substrate fraction, while the other fatty acids: lauric acid, palmitic acid and oleic acid were converted faster. Simulations of the compositions of reaction mixtures with different values of the <b>competitive</b> <b>factors</b> were carried out to provide an overview of what could be achieved using enzymatic enrichment. Possible applications include reactions involving homologous substrates and mixtures of multiple isomers. The analysis presented provides guidelines that can be useful in the screening and development of enzymes for enzymatic enrichment applications. Biotechnol.

50|$|In {{addition}} to socioeconomic status being considered a cultural risk factor {{so is the}} world of sports. Athletes and eating disorders tend to go hand in hand, especially the sports where weight is a <b>competitive</b> <b>factor.</b> Gymnastics, horse back riding, wrestling, body building, and dancing {{are just a few}} that fall into this category of weight dependent sports. Eating disorders among individuals that participate in competitive activities, especially women, often lead to having physical and biological changes related to their weight that often mimic prepubescent stages. Oftentimes as women's bodies change they lose their competitive edge which leads them to taking extreme measures to maintain their younger body shape. Men often struggle with binge eating followed by excessive exercise while focusing on building muscle rather than losing fat, but this goal of gaining muscle is just as much an eating disorder as obsessing over thinness. The following statistics taken from Susan Nolen-Hoeksema's book, (ab)normal psychology, shows the estimated percentage of athletes that struggle with eating disorders based on the category of sport.|$|E
5000|$|Assuming {{that the}} factor costs are {{constant}} (that is, {{that the firm}} is a perfect competitor in all input markets), a firm experiencing constant returns will have constant long-run average costs, a firm experiencing decreasing returns will have increasing long-run average costs, and a firm experiencing increasing returns will have decreasing long-run average costs. [...] However, this relationship breaks down if the firm does not face perfectly <b>competitive</b> <b>factor</b> markets (i.e., in this context, the price one pays for a good does depend on the amount purchased). For example, if there are increasing returns to scale in some range of output levels, but the firm is so big {{in one or more}} input markets that increasing its purchases of an input drives up the input's per-unit cost, then the firm could have diseconomies of scale in that range of output levels.
