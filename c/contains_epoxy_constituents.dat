40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the potential use of sand washing waste as filler for epoxy resin mortar. The mechanical properties of four series of mortars <b>containing</b> <b>epoxy</b> binder at 10, 15, 20, and 25 wt. % mixed with sand blended with sand washing waste filler in the range of 0 – 20 wt. % were examined. The compressive and flexural strength increased with the increase in epoxy and filler content; however, above epoxy 20 wt. %, slight change was seen in strength due to increase in epoxy and filler content. Modulus of elasticity also linearly increased with the increase in filler content, but the use of epoxy content beyond 20 wt. % decreased the modulus of elasticity of the mortar. For epoxy content at 10 wt. %, poor bond strength lower than 0. 8 MPa was observed, and adding filler at 20 wt. % adversely affected the bond strength, in contrast to the mortars <b>containing</b> <b>epoxy</b> at 15, 20, 25 wt. %.

When cracks were initiated or propagated in the composites, the neighbor micro-encapsulated epoxy would be damaged and released. As the latent hardener is soluble in epoxy, {{it can be}} well dispersed in epoxy composites during composites manufacturing, and hence activate the released epoxy wherever it is.

The mixing of epoxy and Cloisite 30 B nanocomposites was performed by mechanical stirring, followed by 1 or 3 -hour ultrasonic treatment, and polyetheramine as the curing agent. Both XRD and TEM analyses confirmed that the intercalation of Cloisite 30 B was achieved. The d 0 spacings for silicate in cured sample prepared at 1 - and 3 -hour duration of ultrasonic treatment were about 21 and 18 [*]Å, respectively.

The following four materials were prepared at room temperature: cured unmodified epoxy, cured toughened epoxy, cured unmodified epoxy/Cloisite 30 B nanocomposites, and cured toughened epoxy/Cloisite 30 B nanocomposites.

40|$|AbstractCarotenoids are the {{effective}} modulators of physical properties of model and natural membranes. To demonstrate {{the relationship between}} the structure of carotenoids and their effect on the molecular dynamics of membranes, we have investigated the influence of five structurally different carotenoids: β-carotene, lycopene, lutein, violaxanthin, zeaxanthin and additionally carotane- a fully saturated derivative of β-carotene, on thermotropic phase behaviour of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) multilamellar vesicles by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results obtained indicate that the carotenoids used modulated the thermotropic properties of multibilayers to various extents, broadening the pretransition and the main phase transition peaks and shifting them to lower temperatures. Pronounced decrease of pretransition enthalpy (ΔHp) proves that carotenoids very strongly alter the membrane properties in its gel phase. Comparison of the influence of several carotenoids shows that a rigid, polyisoprenoid chain plays a basic role in altering the thermotropic properties of such membranes and the presence of rings without oxygen-containing groups has a minor significance for the observed interactions.

40|$|The {{micromechanics}} {{of stress}} transfer is presented for the fibre fragmentation test of microcomposites containing debonded fibre-matrix interface and yielded matrix at the interface region. Results from the parametric study are discussed for carbon fibre composites <b>containing</b> <b>epoxy</b> and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) matrices, representing respectively typical brittle debonding and matrix yielding behaviour at the interface region. The stress transfer phenomena are characterized {{for the two}} interface failure processes. The sequence of interface failure and fibre fracture {{as a function of}} applied stress are also identified. Maximum debonded and yielded interface lengths are obtained above which a fibre will fracture into smaller lengths. There are also threshold fibre fragment lengths above which fibre will fracture without interface debonding or matrix yielding. The applied stresses for these conditions are governed by three strength properties of the composite constituents, namely interface shear bond strength, matrix shear yield strength and fibre tensile strength for given elastic constants of the fibre and matrix, and the geometric factors of the microcomposite. The ineffective length, a measure of the efficiency of stress transfer across the fibre-matrix interface, is shown to strongly depend {{on the extent to which}} these failure mechanisms take place at the interface region...|$|R

However, the progress in imaging algorithms, numerical techniques, microwave hardware and computational speed has renewed the interest in this field. Breast cancer detection is particularly attractive from a microwave imaging perspective, the major reason referred to the potentially high dielectric contrast between cancerous tissues and normal breast tissues depending on water content. Low water tissues tend to be low permittivity as fat, whilst high water content tissues tend to be high permittivity as cancerous tissues. All of that increased the need for effective phantoms that mimic the electromagnetic properties of biological tissues at these high frequencies in a purpose of testing the mutual effects between these radiations and biological tissues.
