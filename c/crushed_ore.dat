25|$|Such methods {{could be}} very {{effective}} in opencast mining, but fire-setting was very dangerous when used in underground workings. They were made redundant {{with the introduction of}} explosives, although hydraulic mining is still used on alluvial tin ores. They were also used to produce a controlled supply to wash the <b>crushed</b> <b>ore.</b> It is highly likely that they also developed water-powered stamp mills to crush hard ore, which could be washed to collect the heavy gold dust.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{function}} of the cascade {{is related to the}} methods of extracting the final traces of gold from the <b>crushed</b> <b>ore.</b> There were probably washing tables between the two tanks so that a gentle stream of water could be used to wash the ore on the rough surface of the tables, the finer gold being caught in the rougher parts of the tables, and removed {{at the end of the}} process. The cascade would probably have been built towards the end of the 1st century when underground mining commenced following opencast development.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s, Captain Borlase's {{efforts to}} save labour costs {{involved}} {{improvements to the}} mill, making it a continuous process. Ore from the mine was separated into three size fractions before crushing the larger ones. The <b>crushed</b> <b>ore</b> was passed through cylindrical trommels so that fractions of different sizes could be sent to separate jigs. Vibrating tables replaced some of the round buddles to treat fine material, and an {{effort was made to}} recover some of the zinc blende in the ore, but this seems not to have been successful. Water provided the motive power in the mill. Smelting and refining remained labour-intensive and costly. In 1903 {{the decision was made to}} stop separating the silver and to sell argentiferous lead to a smelting company. This created an overall saving of 14shillings per ton of lead sold, roughly £750 per year. With labour shortages during World WarI and reduced ore production, it was decided to cease smelting altogether in 1917 and sell the lead concentrates.|$|E

25|$|Before a miner {{could sell}} his ore {{he had to}} dress it. Dressing was the process of extracting the ore from the rock {{in which it was}} {{embedded}} and washing it, a further refining process. In the days of bole smelting the ore was roughly washed clean of waste minerals and dirt before being riddled for bing ore. The ore for the new smelters was smashed, or crushed, into pieces about the size of peas. This was done by hand, using a hammer called a bucker or, in larger mines, on a crushing circle, where a horse dragged a roller round a paved circle on which the ore was placed. <b>Crushed</b> <b>ore</b> was washed either by running water over it in a sloping trough called a buddle or by placing it in a sieve fine enough to prevent any ore particles passing through. The sieve was then plunged several times into a trough. In each case the object was to allow the heavier, lead-rich, particles to sink, enabling those containing lighter, unwanted minerals to be skimmed off the top and removed. These processes were then repeated at the smelter. By the 17th century new mines were being opened, shafts driven deeper, and old waste heaps were yielding new supplies for the smelters.|$|E
25|$|Prospecting was {{successful}} and several opencasts are visible below the large tanks built along its length. The only {{exception is the}} final and very large tank, below which are two reservoirs. It is likely that this complex was used for washing powdered ore to collect the gold dust. More leats and tanks can be found below {{the line of the}} main aqueduct, some of which are shown on the map of the site. They surround the lip of the very large opencast and the tank shown at right is one which was built on the main aqueduct. It {{was successful}} in finding a vein, judging by the opencast below, but must have been modified later to feed a washing table built to the left-hand side (near the figure in the picture), probably to wash the <b>crushed</b> <b>ore</b> from the same opencast working. It is labelled Tank C in the schematic diagram. Similar tanks occur below as the Romans followed the large vein down to the road and the main opencast. Most of the opencast workings must therefore be Roman in origin, since one of the aqueducts has been confirmed by carbon 14 dating as to predate all modern workings. Just by the road itself the Carreg Pumsaint has been erected in the space beside a large mound, now thought to be a dump of waste material from mining activities.|$|E
500|$|Vanadium metal is {{obtained}} by a multistep process {{that begins with}} the roasting of <b>crushed</b> <b>ore</b> with NaCl or Na2CO3 at about 850°C to give sodium metavanadate (NaVO3). An aqueous extract of this solid is acidified to give [...] "red cake", a polyvanadate salt, which is reduced with calcium metal. As an alternative for small-scale production, vanadium pentoxide is reduced with hydrogen or magnesium. Many other methods are also in use, in all of which vanadium is produced as a byproduct of other processes. Purification of vanadium is possible by the crystal bar process developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925. It involves {{the formation of the}} metal iodide, in this example vanadium(III) iodide, and the subsequent decomposition to yield pure metal: ...|$|E

50|$|The {{name comes}} from the hamlet's mining history. Sets of stamps (machines used for <b>crushing</b> <b>ore)</b> were once used on the {{dressing}} floors in the village. The stamps had a total of twelve 'heads'.|$|R
2500|$|Some of {{the shafts}} have balance-bob pits {{associated}} with them, {{and there are}} traces of horse-whims, which were used to raise or lower items in the shafts. Several [...] "reck houses", used for further processing of the <b>crushed</b> <b>ore,</b> are also visible. The ruins of the [...] "mansion" [...] or mine captain's house and its associated buildings {{can be seen to}} the north of the main track. There are further remains of an associated mine known as Wheal Katherine about a kilometre to the east—these include six shafts, a wheelpit and another stamping mill (known as No.7).|$|E
2500|$|Early streamworkers {{operating}} {{on a small scale}} used a block of hard stone as a mortar and perhaps a metalbound piece of wood or a ball of stone as a pestle to break up the ore when necessary, but the rich gravels would have required little or no crushing before concentration. A later technique called [...] "crazing" [...] employed a pair of circular stones used like millstones, the top one rotating on the fixed lower stone. The coarse gravel or <b>crushed</b> <b>ore</b> was introduced into a hole in the centre of the top stone and was rendered to a fine sand. Only three examples of such crazing mills have been found; at Gobbet mine both stones are still visible.|$|E
2500|$|The hammers or [...] "stamps" [...] in a {{stamping}} mill {{consisted of}} vertical balks of timber, iron-shod at the bottom, which were lifted by cams {{attached to the}} waterwheel drive shaft, and repeatedly dropped onto the ore which lay on a block of granite known as a mortarstone. There were usually {{two or three of}} these stamps in a row, powered by the same drive and operating in sequence. At first this process operated on the dry ore, which was shovelled in and removed by hand. However, in a 16th-century innovation from Europe, the stamp heads were surrounded by a wooden box with a finely perforated grill at one end and the ore was washed into the box by a stream of water which also washed out the <b>crushed</b> <b>ore</b> once it was just fine enough to pass through the grill. This was a vast improvement over dry stamping because it was a continuous process that also stopped the production of unwanted very fine dust.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1900 the 10-head Ada Stewart battery at Coen was {{relocated}} to Ebagoola, in time to <b>crush</b> <b>ore</b> during the wet season. A third battery was established on the field soon after.|$|R

40|$|Detail of a {{restored}} stamp mill at Custer, Idaho. Mills like this {{were used to}} <b>crush</b> <b>ore</b> in the 1800 s and early 1900 s during the hard-rock lode gold mining days in the Yankee Fork district.

2500|$|From about 1848 a {{circular}} {{form of the}} buddle was introduced. The <b>crushed</b> <b>ore,</b> suspended in water was introduced onto a central cone and spread outwards over a slightly inclined conical surface. The [...] "heads" [...] would settle near the centre and the [...] "tailings" [...] at the outer edge. The main innovation of the circular buddle was a set of sweep arms, powered by a waterwheel, which rotated above the buddle and carried brushes or pieces of fabric that dragged {{across the surface of}} the settling deposits. By continuously disturbing the surface of the deposit, these stopped the formation of rivulets and allowed better separation to be obtained. The buddle would be run until the deposit built up to between 6 and 12inches (15 and 30cm.) deep. The deposits would then be dug out in three portions, the [...] "middles" [...] often being reprocessed in another buddle of a slightly different specification.|$|E
50|$|The {{underground}} mine is accessible either via an incline ramp or a mine shaft. Ore extraction started at level 500, {{from which the}} process proceeds upwards towards {{the bottom of the}} open-pit. Fully excavated primary stopes are filled with waste rock. From each stope, the ore is carried to an underground crushing station. The <b>crushed</b> <b>ore</b> is transferred via a conveyor belt to <b>crushed</b> <b>ore</b> silos located close to the mine shaft and further to a skip via a measuring pocket. The ore is hoisted through the shaft to an unloading silo located in a 70-meter-tall lifting tower, from where it is forwarded to the concentration process.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>crushed</b> <b>ore</b> is {{irrigated}} with a dilute alkaline cyanide solution. The {{solution containing}} the dissolved precious metals ("pregnant solution") continues percolating through the <b>crushed</b> <b>ore</b> {{until it reaches}} the liner {{at the bottom of}} the heap where it drains into a storage (pregnant solution) pond. After separating the precious metals from the pregnant solution, the dilute cyanide solution (now called [...] "barren solution") is normally re-used in the heap-leach-process or occasionally sent to an industrial water treatment facility where the residual cyanide is treated and residual metals are removed. In very high rainfall areas, such as the tropics, in some cases there is surplus water that is then discharged to the environment, after treatment, posing possible water pollution if treatment is not properly carried out.|$|E
50|$|The Mount Moran Mine is {{important}} in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's mining history, in particular the Etheridge Gold and Mineral Field. It contributes {{to an understanding of}} <b>ore</b> <b>crushing</b> technology utilised on a marginal lode and {{is an example of a}} small battery which was set up to <b>crush</b> <b>ore</b> for a few small mines in an isolated area of the remote field.|$|R
50|$|Gold mining {{played a}} minor role here when {{deposits}} were discovered on Gibson Hill (or Gold Hill) {{south of town}} in the early 1800s. In 1888, the Chifar Consolidated Gold Mine Company began <b>crushing</b> <b>ore</b> at a mine a half mile south of the depot in Gibsonville.|$|R

50|$|An {{extension}} of their other uses, BWEs {{are used in}} heap leaching processes.

25|$|However, {{it was the}} Romans who {{developed}} large scale mining methods, especially the use of large volumes of water brought to the minehead by numerous aqueducts.

50|$|The {{development}} of water mills from their ancient origins was impressive, and extended from agriculture to sawmills both for timber and stone.

Water-power was also widely used in mining for raising <b>ore</b> from shafts, <b>crushing</b> <b>ore,</b> and even powering bellows.|$|R
50|$|In 1887, John Stewart MacArthur, {{working in}} {{collaboration}} with brothers Dr Robert and Dr William Forrest for the Tennant Company in Glasgow, Scotland, developed the MacArthur-Forrest Process for the extraction of gold ores.

50|$|A buddle pit or buddle pond is a pit, often {{circular}} when specifically constructed, {{the purpose}} of which was to separate by sedimentation minerals from lighter rock dust in <b>crushed</b> <b>ore,</b> and used in the mineral mining industry (such as in extracting tin, lead and zinc).
