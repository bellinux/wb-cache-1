They {{are found in}} packages {{as well as on}} multichip modules and directly flip <b>chip</b> <b>bonded</b> on the board. Components including flip chip like ball grid arrays and chip size packages are introduced. Flip chip is the most favored assembly technology for high frequency applications due to the small parasitic of the short bump interconnect. High performance packages for optoelectronic devices using self-alignment during a fluxless reflow soldering are shown as well as the integration of MMICs. High density multichip modules have been fabricated for large pixel detectors of a nuclear detector with eight Chips and more than 46000 I/Os with an acceptable yield. Flip chip technology is a very flexible assembly method for different applications. Variations of the bump structure can be used for MEMS packaging as well and it was demonstrated by the assembly of a thin membrane to form an absolute pressure sensor with a vacuum enclosure. For different packaging requirements the appropriate technology should be chosen very carefully.

Examples are light weight {{for any kind of}} mobile system, as high as possible degree of miniaturization and robustness against chemicals and body liquids for medical implant systems, possible conformity with bend surfaces for applications in aerospace and automotive. Generally the trend towards further increase of function and component density in future electronic systems is from being saturated. On the other hand there is a considerable pressure to keep lower electronic systems prices. Embedding of active and passive components into build up layers of printed wiring boards has on the long term the potential to comply with both requirements at the same time. The European Union is funding two multinational technology development projects focussing on the embedding of chips and passive components into multilayer printed wiring boards.

40|$|There is {{a steady}} trend to ultra-thin microelectronic devices. Especially for future {{particle}} detector systems a reduced readout chip thickness {{is required to}} limit the loss of tracking precision due to scattering. The reduction of silicon thickness is performed at wafer level in a two-step thinning process. To {{minimize the risk of}} wafer breakage the thinned wafer needs to be handled by a carrier during the whole process chain of wafer bumping. Another key process is the flip chip assembly of thinned readout chips onto thin sensor tiles. Besides the prevention of silicon breakage the minimization of chip warpage is one additional task for a high yield and reliable flip chip process. A new technology using glass carrier wafer will be described in detail. The main advantage of this technology is the combination of a carrier support during wafer processing and the chip support during flip chip assembly. For that a glass wafer is glue-bonded onto the backside of the thinned readout chip wafer. After the bump deposition process the glass-readout chip stack is diced in one step. Finally the glass carrier chip is released by laser illumination after flip chip assembly of the readout chip onto sensor tile.

It is utilized {{in the production}} of printed electronics, Radio Frequency (RF) devices and flexible displays [1 - 2]. A new application includes bump fabrication to electrically connect chip and substrate on semiconductor packages. In practice, wire bonding technology has been mainly used for these electrical connections, which can be bonded at a low price. At higher frequencies, however, the wire bonding technique reaches the limit for RF applications, because the bonding wire generates a parasitic inductance that degrades the transmission characteristics. On the other hand, flip <b>chip</b> <b>bonding</b> technology has been developed to overcome the disadvantages of wire bonding [3]. Although flip <b>chip</b> <b>bonding</b> technology can be performed minimizing the distance between chip and substrate, the bump fabrication process is very complex.

The TSVs in the ROCs enable a vertical routing of their peripheral IOs to the back side where they are spread to a land grind array (LGA) with 800 μm pitch. Thus, {{the back side of}} the ROCs can be used for next level interconnection to LTCC system boards which allows a pure vertical system architecture. With this routing concept, area-consuming wire bond connections from the peripheral IOs of the ROCs to the system board can be avoided which is the base for edgeless detector configurations with a tiled assembly of ROCs without imaging dead zones. To enable the envisioned vertical system concept, the ROCs were post-processed with 100 μm deep copper filled TSVs, front and back side redistribution, micro solder bumps for connection to the detector and land grid array (LGA) for connection to the system board. The UFXC 32 k (Ultra Fast X-ray Chip with 32 k channels) served as ROC device featuring an array of 32768 pixel IOs using a pitch of 75 mm, 87 peripheral chip IOs and a total size of 2 cm 2.

For this project, (1 × 12) array photodetectors were developed using PIN diodes with a GaAs/AlGaAs strained layer structure. The devices had a pitch of 250 μm, operated at a wavelength of 850 nm. Optical characterisation experiments of two types of detector arrays (shoe and ring) were successfully performed. Overall, the shoe devices achieved more consistent results in comparison with ring diodes, i. e. lower dark current and series resistance values. A decision was made to choose the shoe design for implementation into the high speed systems demonstrator. The (1 x 12) VCSEL array devices were the optical sources used in my research. This was an identical array at 250 μm pitch configuration used in order to match the photodetector array. These devices had a wavelength of 850 nm. Optoelectronic testing of the VCSEL was successfully conducted, which provided good beam profile analysis and I-V-P measurements of the VCSEL array. This was then implemented into a simple demonstrator system, where eye diagrams examined the systems performance and characteristics of the full system and showed positive results. An explanation was given of the following optoelectronic bonding techniques: Wire bonding and flip chip bonding with its associated technologies, i. e. Solder, gold stud bump and ACF.

Fluxless soldering is possible directly on different thick film pattern metallizations. Concerning the process optimization and reliability investigations the Flip-Chip bonding experiments were performed using special test chips and test substrates. In order to study the thermomechanical behavior of the joints FEM-simulations were performed. In the project two bumping processes based on electroplated Au/Sn and Pb/Sn solders were developed. The bonding process was performed with the flip-chip bonder FC- 950 from Carl Suess. For a fluxless soldering process, special aspects of reference were formulated. The fluxless flip chip bonding experiments were performed on different thick film metallization using substrates with an excellent flatness. The best mechanical and electrical results are achieved with Au/Sn solder bumps mounted on Pd/Ag metallizations. The influence of the contact height and the chip size on reliability were investigated by thermal cycling. The reliability of the joints could be significantly increased if an adequate underfill material was applied. This could be demonstrated by thermal cycling and ATC-testing of the fluxless mounted and encapsulated chips.

In addition, {{the effect of adding}} a resistive layer on the thin film substrate is evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{modulators}} using “Lithium Niobate ” (LiNb 03) {{have become}} the industry standard for high-speed data transmission and RF photonic links. Packaging is a determining factor in maintaining low cost and high-performance. This paper investigates the application of flip chip technology to optical modulator packaging. Experimental results show that rugged flip <b>chip</b> <b>bonds</b> can be realized with minimal impact on the modulator electrical performance. I...|$|R
