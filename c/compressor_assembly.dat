Many of these units are still functional today, after requiring little more service than a replacement start relay or thermostat if at all.

50|$|A turbo timer is {{a device}} {{designed}} to keep an automotive engine running for a pre-specified period in order to automatically execute the cool-down period required to prevent premature turbo wear and failure. After a period of driving when a turbocharger has been working hard, {{it is important to}} let the engine run at idle speed for a period, allowing the <b>compressor</b> <b>assembly</b> to cool from the lower gas temperatures in both the exhaust and intake tracts. At the same time the lubricating oil from the engine is able to circulate properly so the turbine won't burn the lubricating oil that would otherwise be trapped within the charger with the turbine rotating at high speed. With regard to modern automotive turbochargers, the need for a turbo timer can be eliminated by simply ensuring the car does not produce any 'boost' (during driving) for several minutes prior to the ignition being shut off.Most turbo timers are based on digital electronics.|$|E

An adequate evaluation of vibroactivity of piston machines is provided by the Russian regulative database on vibration parameters. Main differences of Russian and global methods of reciprocating compressors health evaluation, particularly, used frequency range, are presented in the article. It is shown that the approach laid in Russian standards on reciprocating compressors vibration regulations, ensures true-to-life assessment of reciprocating <b>compressors</b> <b>assemblies</b> and details condition. The examples given in the article confirm that the criteria of reciprocating compressors repair correctness assessment should be the machinery health, including its vibroactivity, not just mindless usage of new components purchased from the global brands. Practical examples of operation and monitoring of reciprocating compressors show that Russian developments and products, particularly, scientific-methodological and standards base of Vibration-Based Diagnostics monitoring, reciprocating compressors monitoring systems, reciprocating compressors valves are highly competitive with foreign ones, and sometimes even superior to them in parameters and characteristics, which is a positive factor under the conditions of current economic situation and import substitution policy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a large-scale aeroelasticity computation for an aero-engine core compressor. The computational domain includes all 17 bladerows, {{resulting in a}} mesh with over 68 million points. The Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are used to represent the flow in a non-linear time-accurate fashion on unstructured meshes of mixed elements. The structural model {{of the first two}} rotor bladerows is based on a standard finite element representation. The fluid mesh is moved at each time step according to the structural motion so that changes in blade aerodynamic damping and flow unsteadiness can be accommodated automatically. An efficient domain decomposition technique, where special care was taken to balance the memory requirement across processors, was developed as part of the work. The calculation was conducted in parallel mode on 128 CPUs of an SGI Origin 3000. Ten vibration cycles were obtained using over 2. 2 CPU years, though the elapsed time was a week only. Steady-state flow measurements and predictions were found to be in good agreement. A comparison of the averaged unsteady flow and the steady-state flow revealed some discrepancies. It was concluded that, in due course, the methodology would be adopted by industry to perform routine numerical simulations of the unsteady flow through entire <b>compressor</b> <b>assemblies</b> with vibrating blades not only to minimise engine and rig tests but also to improve performance predictions...|$|R

5000|$|The PD-4103 {{itself was}} {{superseded}} by the radically new, monocoque-bodied PD-4104 in mid-1953, which eliminated the traditional longitudinal steel frame, {{had a much}} improved air conditioning system which used an underfloor evaporator {{in conjunction with the}} heater cores giving a [...] "reheat" [...] system providing excellent temperature control, had commodious luggage bays afforded by the elimination of the traditional frame, and an all-new air suspension system that used common parts with 1953 transit models. The PD-4104's ride and handling were far superior to that of the old steel sprung previous models, and paved the way for higher passenger and operator expectations all through the 1950s. The new PD-4104 also was wrapped in GM's version of Raymond Loewy's [...] "Highway Traveler" [...] concept bus, which also shared most styling features with the later PD-4501 Scenicruiser, another exclusive Greyhound Lines model. The PD-4104, although appearing to be completely new, actually was a heavy reworking of Greyhound Lines' previous PD-3751/PD-4151 models, as several structural members were identical. It also, for the first several months, used the same Continental/Ingersoll-Rand engine/refrigeration <b>compressor</b> <b>assembly</b> that dated {{all the way back to}} the [...] "Silversides" [...] during World War II. This would soon give way to higher capacity, more reliable Waukesha/Trane engine/compressor combination that was rated at a nominal six tons. Although the earliest PD-4104s were fairly adequate (certainly more adequate than the PD-4103) in terms of refrigeration capacity, the later PD-4104 could overcome even the hottest and most humid climes with ease. Greyhound Lines' second order of PD-4104s used Waukesha diesels to drive their air conditioning, an option reserved for them only, while later orders for Trailways retained the standard gasoline engine. The PD-4104 would be the last GM coach for any service that used a separate engine to provide refrigeration service.|$|E

40|$|Gas turbine {{compressor}} performance {{may encounter}} deterioration during service {{for various reasons}} such as damage by debris from the casing or foreign objects impacting on the blades, typically near the rotor's tip. Moreover, mal-schedule of Variable Stator Vanes (VSVs) during start-up may also result in performance deterioration and reduction in the surge margin. Ability to assess the effect of compressor deterioration using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is important at both design stage and in service. Compressor blade damage breaks the cyclic symmetry and the VSVs mal-schecule creates mis-match between stages together with geometric variations, thus computations are desirable to be performed using full annulus assemblies. Furthermore, downstream boundary conditions are also unknown during rotating stall or surge and simulations become difficult. This research presents unsteady time-accurate CFD analyses of compressor performance with tip curl blade damage in a single stage axial flow compressor and VSVs mal-schedule in a 3. 5 stage axial flow compressor. Computations were per- formed near stall boundary to predict rotating stall characteristics. The primary objectives are to characterise the overall compressor performance and analyse the detailed flow behaviour. Computations for the nominal blade configurations were also performed for comparison purposes for both compressors. All unsteady simulations were performed at part speeds with a variable nozzle downstream representing an experimental throttle. For the blade damage study, two different degrees of damage for one blade and multiple damaged blades were investigated and compared with {{the results from the}} undamaged case. For the VSVs mal-schedule study, the first two stators were assumed to be variable and were used to create mal-schedule vane settings for the investigation. The effects of blade damage and VSVs mal-schedule on the aerodynamics performance and rotating stall characteristics for both <b>compressor</b> <b>assemblies</b> were investigated respectively and discussed in detail...|$|R

40|$|Welding of nickel-based {{superalloys}} {{is employed}} {{in the manufacture of}} many important components of the jet engine, such as combustor casings, <b>compressor</b> disc <b>assemblies,</b> etc. Welds induce microstructural modification in the weld seam and the heat affected zone (HAZ) which generally reduce the fatigue resistance compared to that of the parent metal. Welds also generate significant residual stresses, both locally due to combination of solidification shrinkage and high temperature plastic deformation, and also globally through the general tensioning of the structure. Diffraction of high energy synchrotron X-rays is very well suited to the task of accurate non-destructive evaluation of residual stresses near welds in thin walled components assembled by welding nickel superalloys.
