5|$|In the United States, dragonflies and damselflies are {{sought out}} as a hobby similar to birding and butterflying, known as oding, from the Latin name of the {{dragonfly}} order, Odonata. Oding is especially popular in Texas, where 225 different species of odonates have been observed. With care, and with dry fingers, dragonflies can be handled and released by oders, as <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> with butterflies, {{though it is not}} encouraged.|$|E
5|$|Quantitative easing (QE) is the {{practice}} in which a central bank tries to mitigate a potential or actual recession by increasing the money supply for its domestic economy. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by printing money and injecting it into the domestic economy via open market operations. There may be a promise to destroy any newly created money once the economy improves {{in order to avoid}} inflation.|$|E
5|$|The actual welding {{technique}} utilized {{depends on the}} electrode, {{the composition of the}} workpiece, and the position of the joint being welded. The choice of electrode and welding position also determine the welding speed. Flat welds require the least operator skill, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> with electrodes that melt quickly but solidify slowly. This permits higher welding speeds.|$|E

50|$|Hysteroscopy has <b>been</b> <b>done</b> in the hospital, {{surgical}} {{centers and}} the office. It <b>is</b> best <b>done</b> when the endometrium is relatively thin, that is after a menstruation. Diagnostic <b>can</b> easily <b>be</b> <b>done</b> {{in an office}} or clinic setting on suitably selected patients. Local anesthesia <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used. Simple operative hysteroscopy <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in an office or clinic setting. Analgesics are not always necessary. A paracervical block may be used using a Lidocaine injection in {{the upper part of}} the cervix. The patient is in a lithotomy position during the procedure. Hysteroscopic intervention <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>done</b> under general anesthesia (endotracheal or laryngeal mask) or Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC). Prophylactic antibiotics are not necessary.|$|R

Wax is such a substance. Water poured onto a smooth, flat, horizontal wax surface, say a waxed sheet of glass, will behave similarly to the mercury poured onto glass.|$|E
5|$|The true {{and only}} {{practicable}} object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, {{not of the}} minute details and manipulations of the arts, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> only in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} the crash, the {{families}} of various passengers aboard Flight 706 began filing lawsuits and court papers against Hughes Airwest and, later, {{the government of the}} United States. The first filing was by the family of Keith A. Gabel, which filed a motion to perpetuate testimony in the Central District of California on June 16, 1971. This motion requests that the court issue a court order for a person's deposition to be taken, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> prior to a lawsuit being filed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.|$|E

5|$|At Dunder Mifflin, Charles Miner (Idris Elba) {{announces that}} the Scranton branch, {{previously}} the company's most profitable office, has lost ten major clients to Michael's company. Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley) visits Scranton {{to see what}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to stem the losses. In a blatant about-face from his no-nonsense persona, Charles blatantly sucks up to David, which Jim notices. David calls a meeting with Charles and Jim (John Krasinski), but Charles insists Dwight (Rainn Wilson) also be present {{because he had been}} Charles's right-hand man. However, during the meeting Dwight embarrasses Charles with outlandish suggestions, such as unleashing a hive of bees.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} larval {{development}} inside the seeds which {{are protected by}} the pods, most inventorying methods are based on population of B. rufimanus adult in the field or at emergence. Adult population density can be estimated by counts on plants at field colonization. The development semiochemical attractants trapping systems for both monitoring and pest control has received particular interest in ongoing research on the weevil. Egg density can be estimated on young developing pods (>2 cm) during the oviposition period. Eggs are however small (<1mm length), green-yellowish, therefore difficult to observe. In addition, population estimate are difficult to obtain as egg laying is spread over time until 5–10 days {{after the end of}} flowering (BBCH 77). After harvest, seed quality can be observed manually at harvest and characterized according to pest damage (healthy, with no trace of damage/containing developing larvae/trace of emerged B. rufimanus adult (a hole in the seed). Alternative methods exist to sort the seeds: sorting <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> using differences in seed density due to the presence of the developing larva or of the hole left by the emerged adult, estimation of damages seeds <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by tomography analysis. Additionally, the end of larval and pupal diapause and therefore the emergence of B. rufimanus can be induced via a solution of NaOCl and chinosol in 7 days at 30 °C, allowing the estimation of an overall infestation rate can be assessed.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebee {{conservation}} {{is in its}} infancy {{in many parts of}} the world, but with the realization of the important part they play in pollination of crops, efforts are being made to manage farmland better. Enhancing the wild bee population <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by the planting of wildflower strips, and in New Zealand, bee nesting boxes have achieved some success, perhaps because there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country.|$|E

5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both rapid and slow doses <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce a therapeutic effect) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy, where patients were more likely to suffer from a systemic reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of allergic reactions. Despite immunotherapy being successful, only ten percent of patients do not have any response to desensitisation.|$|E
5|$|It {{is largely}} an {{empirical}} procedure, {{and has a}} reasonable safety record {{within the scope of}} its intended application. Advantages are reduced overall decompression time and for some versions, easy estimation of decompression by the use of a simple rule-based procedure which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> underwater by the diver. It requires the use of specific gas mixtures for given depth ranges. The advantages claimed are flexibility in that if the depth is not known accurately, the schedule can be adjusted during the dive to allow for the actual depth, and that it allows deep dives without the use of an expensive trimix dive computer.|$|E
5|$|Linear {{search is}} a simple search {{algorithm}} that checks every record until it finds the target value. Linear search <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> on a linked list, which allows for faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary search is faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if the array is short. If the array must first be sorted, that cost must be amortized over any searches. Sorting the array also enables efficient approximate matches and other operations.|$|E
