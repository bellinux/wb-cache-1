5|$|Both Newt Lee, {{after the}} {{discovery}} of Phagan's body, and the police, just after 4a.m., had unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank early on Sunday, April 27. The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory. When the police arrived after 7a.m. without telling the specifics of {{what happened at the}} factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing his hands and asking questions before the police <b>could</b> <b>answer.</b> Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, PRS member Richard Hurlock had {{approached}} {{the society for}} a home for his ex-Swedish railways class S1 2-6-4T oil-fired locomotive, number 1928. Because the engine was higher and wider than British stock, {{it was to be}} a static exhibition only. During 1974, it was realised that the use of foreign stock and engines <b>could</b> <b>answer</b> the NVR's aspirations. After a feasibility study was carried out, it was discovered that only one bridge would have to be demolished to allow the running to continental loading gauge. Some reductions would also have to be made to the width of the platforms. In 1973, BR gave PRS permission to use Wansford signal box and, in September of that year, the first items of stock arrived at the PRS depot.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time Big Brother Australia {{featured}} a telephone in the house. It was situated in the lounge and was shown on the Opening Night broadcast before the housemates entered the house. On Day 37, Big Brother informed housemates that if the phone rang only one housemate <b>could</b> <b>answer</b> it. Joel was nominated to answer it on the housemates' behalf. On Day 52 Joel {{received a call from}} Big Brother advising that he would be away from the house and would communicate via the phone to Joel at various times. On Day 58 Andrew picked up the phone as a joke, and was penalised by being sent to the Punishment Room to polish boots. Michelle joined him in the Punishment Room due to the weekly task which involved housemates remaining partnered.|$|E

25|$|Many farmers {{around the}} world are unaware of fair trade {{practices}} that they could be implementing to earn a higher wage. Coffee {{is one of the most}} highly traded commodities in the world, yet the farmers who grow it typically earn less than $2 a day. When surveyed, farmers from Cooperativa Agraria Cafetalera Pangoa (CAC Pangoa) in San Martín de Pangoa, Peru, <b>could</b> <b>answer</b> positively that they have heard about fair trade, but were not able to give a detailed description about what fair trade is. They could, however, identify fair trade based on some of its possible benefits to their community. When asked, overall, farmers cited that fair trade has had a positive effect on their lives and communities. They also wanted consumers to know that fair trade is important for supporting their families and their cooperatives.|$|E
25|$|Sovereigntists are {{moderate}} nationalists who do {{not believe}} Canada to be reformable {{in a way that}} <b>could</b> <b>answer</b> {{what they see as the}} legitimate wish of Quebecers to govern themselves freely. They opt for the independence of Quebec; however, at the same time they insist on offering an economic and political partnership to the rest of Canada on the basis of the equality of both nations. The political parties created by the sovereigntists created are the Bloc Québécois and the Parti Québécois, which its members define as a party of social democratic tendency. The Parti Québécois organized a 1980 referendum and a 1995 referendum, each of which could have led to negotiations for independence had it succeeded. The No side prevailed in both, but its margin was very narrow in the second referendum (50.6% No, 49.4% Yes). Sovereigntists find their ideological origins in the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association, René Lévesque's short-lived precursor to the Parti Québécois.|$|E

500|$|Ashley began a storyline with Maria and Santino Marella at the January 21, 2008 {{episode of}} Raw, {{attempting}} to convince Maria {{to pose for}} Playboy but was interrupted by Marella. At the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, Ashley again attempted to convince Maria by telling her that Hugh Hefner wanted her to pose for Playboy before Maria <b>could</b> <b>answer</b> Marella interrupted and objected to the proposal. Ashley would then beat down Marella's surprise Big Dick Johnson when he attempted to perform a strip tease. At the No Way Out pay-per-view, Ashley would appear with Maria in a segment at the Playboy Manison. On the March 24, 2008 episode of Raw, Ashley interfered in the match between Maria and Melina. After the match, Santino Marella {{came down to the}} ring [...] so Jerry “The King” Lawler (whom was tired of Marella's actions over previous weeks) knocked Santino out of the ring. Which set up the six person mixed-tag-team match, in which they lost to Marella, Melina and Phoenix. Massaro replaced Candice Michelle, who was out with an injury, in the Playboy Bunnymania Lumberjack match at WrestleMania XXIV teaming up with Maria, losing to Beth Phoenix and Melina after the interference from Marella.|$|E
500|$|While President Ronald Reagan was a {{supporter}} of the Contra cause, the evidence is disputed as to whether he authorized the diversion of the money raised by the Iranian arms sales to the Contras. Handwritten notes taken by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on December 7, 1985, indicate that Reagan was aware of potential hostage transfers with Iran, as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to [...] "moderate elements" [...] within that country. Weinberger wrote that Reagan said [...] "he <b>could</b> <b>answer</b> to charges of illegality but couldn't answer to the charge that 'big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to free the hostages. After the weapon sales were revealed in November 1986, Reagan appeared on national television and stated that the weapons transfers had indeed occurred, but that the United States did not trade arms for hostages. The investigation was impeded when large volumes of documents relating to the scandal were destroyed or withheld from investigators by Reagan administration officials. On March 4, 1987, Reagan returned to the airwaves in a nationally televised address, taking full responsibility, and saying that [...] "what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages".|$|E
500|$|To this day, Reagan's {{role in the}} {{transactions}} is not definitively known; it is unclear exactly what Reagan knew and when, and whether the arms sales were motivated by his desire to save the U.S. hostages. Oliver North wrote that [...] "Ronald Reagan knew of and approved {{a great deal of}} what went on with both the Iranian initiative and private efforts on behalf of the contras and he received regular, detailed briefings on both...I have no doubt that he was told about the use of residuals for the Contras, and that he approved it. Enthusiastically." [...] Handwritten notes by Defense Secretary Weinberger indicate that the President was aware of potential hostages transfers with Iran, as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to what he was told were [...] "moderate elements" [...] within Iran. Notes taken on December 7, 1985, by Weinberger record that Reagan said that [...] "he <b>could</b> <b>answer</b> charges of illegality but he couldn't answer charge [...] that 'big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to free hostages'". The Republican-written [...] "Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair" [...] concluded, that There is some question and dispute about precisely the level at which he chose to follow the operation details. There is no doubt, however, ... the President set the US policy towards Nicaragua, with few if any ambiguities, and then left subordinates more or less free to implement it.|$|E

Another explanation: Ezra (whom some consider the author of these diacritical points, although others regard them as having come from Sinai) reasoned that if Elijah came and asked Ezra why he had written these words, Ezra <b>could</b> <b>answer</b> that he had already placed points over them. And if Elijah told Ezra that he had done well in writing them, then Ezra would erase the points over them. (If Elijah said that the words should not have been written, Ezra <b>could</b> <b>answer</b> that he had dotted them so that people could understand that they were to be disregarded. If Elijah approved of the words, then Ezra could erase the dots.) ...|$|E

2500|$|After 1965, when {{he entered}} a new period of {{prolific}} writing, Herseni sought to accumulate direct knowledge {{in the field of}} industrial sociology, reviving and adapting Gusti's (and his own) interwar methodology: a monographic [...] "problem-centered" [...] technique, and a focus on interdisciplinarity. Herseni involved himself in debates about the future of sociology, defending the science against criticism, and arguing that sociologists <b>could</b> <b>answer</b> specific problems that could not be addressed by statisticians or economists.|$|E

2500|$|In early rounds, team captains would 'pick a packet' (a {{numbered}} pack of ten questions) from a {{board of}} numbered options. [...] Teams <b>could</b> <b>answer</b> these questions with no penalties for incorrect answers but each round was time limited and teams would 'pass' difficult questions to attempt remaining questions before returning to passed questions. [...] All team members could respond to questions; in cases where two answers were given at the same time, the host would ask the captain to confirm the team's response. A 'beat the buzzer' segment and later a video-clip round completed the contest. In 'beat the buzzer', penalties applied for incorrectly anwered questions. In cases of ties, captains would pick tie-breaker packets for their team to answer.|$|E
2500|$|Buñuel {{is often}} cited {{as one of the}} world's most {{prominent}} atheists. [...] In a 1960 interview, he was asked about his attitude toward religion, and his response has become one of his most celebrated quotes: [...] "I'm still an atheist, thank God." [...] But his entire answer to the question was somewhat more nuanced: [...] "I have no attitude. I was raised in it. I <b>could</b> <b>answer</b> [...] "I'm still an atheist, thank God." [...] I believe we must seek God within man himself. This is a very simple attitude." [...] Critics have pointed out that Buñuel's atheism was closely connected to his surrealism, in that he considered chance and mystery, and not providence, to be at the heart of all reality.|$|E
