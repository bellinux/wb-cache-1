50|$|The main {{advantage}} of a class-D amplifier is power efficiency. Because the output pulses have a fixed amplitude, the switching elements (usually MOSFETs, but vacuum tubes, and at one time bipolar transistors, were used) are switched either completely on or completely off, rather than operated in linear mode. A MOSFET operates with the lowest resistance when fully on and thus (excluding when fully off) has the lowest power dissipation when in that condition. Compared to an equivalent class-AB device, a class-D amplifier's lower losses {{permit the use of}} a smaller heat sink for the MOSFETs while also reducing the amount of input power required, allowing for a lower-capacity power supply design. Therefore, class-D amplifiers are typically smaller than an equivalent <b>class-AB</b> <b>amplifier.</b>|$|E

Despite their high efficiency, Class-D amplifiers are undesirable as headphone drivers in mobile devices, owing to their high EMI radiation, additional costs due to filtering required at the output and also their poor linearity at small signal levels. Almost all of todays headphone drivers are Class-AB linear amplifiers, with poor efficiencies. Here we propose a Class-G linear amplifier, which uses rail switching to improve efficiency. It can be viewed as a <b>Class-AB</b> <b>amplifier</b> operating from the lower supply and a Class-C amplifier from the higher supply. Though the classical definition of efficiency using full-scale sine wave does not show much improvement for Class-G (85. 9 percent) over Class-AB (78 percent), we demonstrate that the Class-G audio amplifiers can have significant improvement of efficiencies (battery life) in the practical sense. By considering the amplitude distribution of audio signals a new realistic definition of efficiency has been proposed. This definition helps in demonstrating the advantage of using Class-G over Class-AB and also helps in optimizing the choice of supply voltages which is critical to maximizing the efficiency of Class-G amplifiers.

Several techniques are under research to tackle this problem. These techniques can be classified as efficiency and linearity oriented techniques. Predistortion, feedforward and feedback techniques are examples of the first sort of techniques, which mainly correct the inherent distortionof the amplifier by providing an inversion function of the amplifier orby comparison with the original input signal. Examples of the second type of technique are dynamic biasing, dynamic load and Envelope Elimination and Restoration (EER), which basically vary the bias or load of the amplifier according to the input signal.

Operation down to 1. 0 V at 15 //A is possible with 400 kHz UGF. The die area of the chip is 0. 05 mm 2 (70 mil’). I...|$|R
