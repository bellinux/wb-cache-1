50|$|Brazil has {{at least}} 161,500 {{kilometers}} of paved roads, more than 93 Gigawatts of installed electric power capacity and its real per capita GDP surpassed US$10,500 in 2008, due to the strong and continued appreciation of the real {{for the first time}} that decade. Its industrial sector accounts for three-fifths of the Latin American economy's industrial production. The country's scientific and technological development is argued to be attractive to foreign direct investment, which has averaged US$30 billion per year the last years, compared to only US$2 billion per year last decade, remarkable growth. The agricultural sector, locally called the agronegócio (agro-business), has also been remarkably dynamic: for two decades this sector has kept Brazil among the most highly productive countries in areas related to the rural sector. The agricultural sector and the mining sector also supported trade surpluses which allowed for massive <b>currency</b> <b>gains</b> (rebound) and external debt paydown. Due to a downturn in Western economies, Brazil found itself in 2010 trying to halt the appreciation of the real.|$|E

This thesis conducts {{an examination of}} processes that lead to balancing the balance of payments of the member countries and impacts of these processes on various macroeconomic indicators in order to outline possible impacts of German competitiveness on economic disparities within Eurozone. The analysis showed that Germany due to its high competitiveness and weak <b>currency</b> <b>gains</b> significant economic advantage whereas other less competitive Eurozone countries are ending up on the economic periphery. Contribution of this thesis is that it provides us with an explanation of an opposing development of some macroeconomic indicators compared with development of the same indicators in Germany...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} an auction-based {{cooperative}} sensing protocol for secondary users in cognitive networks. The proposed auction mechanism {{is based on}} a novel modified Vickrey auction with a three dimensional bid, that accounts for detection gains as well as for virtual <b>currency</b> <b>gains.</b> We present a formal proof to show that the proposed three dimensional bidding mechanism preserves the truthfulness property of the classic Vickrey auction. The cooperative auction is combined with a prioritized access scheme to increase the efficiency and to reduce the response time for the coalition formation procedure. Our auction-based cooperative sensing mechanism can be easily applied to different network scenarios, by defining specific utility functions. The proposed cooperative sensing auctioning mechanism is illustrated for both downlink and uplink. Our simulation results show that users' cooperation is incentivized by the proposed algorithm, which leads to significant detection gains for the downlink and the uplink scenarios, with a more efficient energy expenditure...|$|E
40|$|Introduction]. Until the 19 th and mid- 20 th centuries, {{economic}} theory {{explained that the}} economic status of a country was represented by {{the strength of its}} currency. 2 This strength is measured by the exchange rate of one currency vis-á-vis another currency, a “zero-sum” game in which one <b>currency</b> <b>gains</b> what the other loses. In fact, during the 19 th century, the strength of the Pound Sterling facilitated Britain’s global hegemonic political and economic power known as the Pax Britanica. During the 20 th century, the strength of the US dollar represented both the economic and political hegemony of the US around the world known as the Pax Americana. Nowadays, the weakness of the US dollar is making specialists wonder if we are witnessing the end of Pax Americana and the beginning of something else, possibly a Pax Europea, led by the strength of the euro. This is the argument surrounding the current behaviour of the US$-€ exchange rate and its effect on the economic performance of these two economic blocs. While the current exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro has been considered a blessing for the US, it has become a matter of concern for most Eurozone countries. In fact, we are witnessing an unprecedented scenario where the country with a weak currency is actually pleased and the group of countries with a strong currency is worried. The strength of the euro is becoming irritating for the Eurozone and, nevertheless, the weakness of the US dollar is also pushing it to the brink of losing its status as a global currency. This exchange rate debate is accompanied by another debate concerning how the latest monetary policy actions taken by the US and Eurozone monetary authorities 3, aimed at solving current economic imbalances, are affecting the US$-€ exchange rate. Scholars, economists, and politicians argue that these monetary policies seem unable to solve today’s economic problems in the EU {{as well as in the}} Eurozone, but are having a tremendous impact on the US$-€ exchange rate. This paper will explain in layman’s terms the relationship (or lack thereof) between two of today’s most important economic issues: the US dollar and euro exchange rate, and the monetary policy behind it...|$|E
