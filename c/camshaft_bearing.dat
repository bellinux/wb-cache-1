During the machining process, the cylinders were etched leaving the pure silicon particles exposed providing the piston wear surface, {{eliminating the need for}} iron cylinder liners. The block has cast iron main caps and a cast iron crankshaft. The engine's cylinder head is cast iron for lower cost, structural integrity and longer <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> life.

5000|$|In 1974, Australian {{importer}} Ron Angel {{entered a}} [...] "Ducati 860 SS" [...] in the Unlimited Production {{event at the}} Easter motorbike races at Bathurst, on the mountain. This was the biggest annual motorcycle event in Australia at the time. The bike was ridden by Kenny Blake, and defeated the then dominant Kawasaki Z1 900s on the day. It was sensational. The crowd loved it. Protests flew. Ron Angel immediately started advertising the bikes, saying a shipment was on the way. There was {{an investigation into the}} bona-fides of the bike by the governing body - the Auto Cycle Union of New South Wales. The bike was accepted when the Ducati factory sent a letter confirming that Ducati 860 SuperSports were being manufactured, and the ACU-NSW awarded the race to Blake and the 860 SuperSport. When the 900 SuperSport shipment finally did arrive, it was a different bike to the 860 SuperSport that had won Bathurst, {{but it was too late}} to matter. That special Bathurst bike had round cases, and looked identical to a green frame 750 SS, but with the 860 <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> mounts on the heads, and 860 SuperSport on the bikes side covers. Ron Angel later said that the bike had been built by Ducati at his request for the previous Bathurst, but was then ruled ineligible, so more work was done and the bike was sent by sea, arriving in time for the race the following year, where it was presented as a production bike. It had special parts, including the Imola cams and the limited availability close ratio gearbox. The 2 kg inboard flywheel had been removed, but the bike did not have the straight cut primary gears of the Imola bikes.

5000|$|As {{a method}} to reduce {{production}} costs, Ford eliminated {{one of the main}} oil galleys from the block casting, resulting in the 335 series having two galleys versus the Windsor family's three. The result was an oil system very similar to the 385 series V8 engines. The two main oil galleys in the 335 series engine run along the lifter bores. Oil is fed from the filter to the number one main bearing followed by the number one cam bearing above. At the same time, it also feeds the right hand oil galley, feeding the right side lifter bank. The lifter bank has four galleys that lead to each of the remaining main bearings. After the oil feeds the main bearings, it feeds each corresponding <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> above. At the rear-most main bearing, the oil goes into the other galley which feeds the left lifter bank.

50|$|In the {{crankcase}} of {{a vehicle}} engine, motor oil lubricates rotating or sliding surfaces between the crankshaft journal bearings (main bearings and big-end bearings), and rods connecting the pistons to the crankshaft. The oil collects in an oil pan, or sump, {{at the bottom of}} the crankcase. In some small engines such as lawn mower engines, dippers on the bottoms of connecting rods dip into the oil at the bottom and splash it around the crankcase as needed to lubricate parts inside. In modern vehicle engines, the oil pump takes oil from the oil pan and sends it through the oil filter into oil galleries, from which the oil lubricates the main bearings holding the crankshaft up at the main journals and <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> operating the valves. In typical modern vehicles, oil pressure-fed from the oil galleries to the main bearings enters holes in the main journals of the crankshaft.|$|R

40|$|Analytical {{methods to}} enable the {{evaluation}} of important lubrication operational parameters at the contact between any cam and follower mechanism (excluding valve trains incorporating rolling element followers or hydraulic lash adjusters) have been collated, critically assessed and developed. A robust and user friendly computer program, which incorporated these methods, was written in order that the tribological conditions existing at the cam/follower interface of any type of valve train in common use in today's internal combustion engines could be studied. The output from the program included graphical displays of frictional torque, minimum lubricant film thickness and Hertzian stress around the cam cycle. Such studies were performed on a cam and flat faced follower system, a cam and centrally pivoted follower system, a cam and end pivoted follower system and a desmodromic system (comprising a conventional cam and centrally pivoted. system and a desmodromic cam and end pivoted follower system). The computer program also allowed parametric studies {{to be carried out}} on valve train mechanisms. Parametric studies of three different valve trains, including the valve trains from the Rover 2300 and the Ford 2. 0 litre Pinto engines, have been presented, the results being presented in graphical and tabular form. The loadings, orbits, and power losses associated with the <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> of the Ford 2. 0 litre Pinto engine were evaluated using existing dynamically loaded bearing analysis techniques. The total frictional power loss predicted for the three <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> was found to be equal to approximately one fifth of that calculated for all of the cam/follower interfaces throughout the operational speed range of the engine. An experimental single valve desmodromic valve train apparatus was designed and commissioned to test the accuracy of the valve train lubrication analysis computer program. The apparatus allowed studies to be made of the running-in of valve trains operating at lubricant temperatures of 40 C, 60 C and. 80 C, by applying the electrical resistivity technique. Analytical models used to predict which cam/follower pair was in control of the valve at any point around the cam cycle were tested using an electrical continuity technique and were found to show good agreement with practice. Good agreement was also found between the theoretically predicted and measured torque and power required to drive the valve train. ...|$|R

50|$|The Interceptor had one endemic engine {{issue in}} the V4, {{camshaft}} wear. In 1984, camshaft issues started to arise and owners started to complain. At first Honda did not admit {{that there was a}} problem but after conducting further research, they decided that the camshaft wear was most likely caused by oil flow issues. Valve clearance issues were also suggested as a possible contributory factor. Honda issued a recall on the bikes and added kink-free oil lines and less restrictive banjo bolts. They also made alterations by drilling holes in the cam lobes and capping off the hollow cam's ends. This did not fix the problem, so Honda went back to the drawing board. The first thought was that the issue was heat related, but after further investigation the real problem was discovered - there was too much clearance in the <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings.</b> Honda fixed this by changing all the camshafts with new components. This fixed the camshaft issues but the reputation of the Honda V4 was already damaged.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a multibody {{model of}} a car engine valve train system was developed, by using LMS Virtual. Lab software, in order to analyse its {{resonant}} vibrational behaviour. The model complexity {{is the result of}} a compromise between the need to obtain accurate results (with acceptable run times) and the requirement of an easy integration of subcomponent models into a virtual assembly. The cam-follower contact was modelled using appropriate tools of the adopted code (Generator Cam, Cam Contact). Model validation was realised by comparing the kinematic laws of the valve motion, obtained from the numerical simulation, against those obtained from the experimental tests performed by FCA Group. Then, the dynamics of the valve train system was analysed, applying a ramp to the crankshaft with a variable engine speed (1, 000 to 6, 000 rpm) and considering the motion unsmoothness deriving from the inertia and combustion pressure loads. The camshaft is considered rigidly connected to the crankshaft by a mechanism with a transmission ratio equal to 0. 5. Such analyses allow to assess the valve bounce, the disengagement phenomena of the cam-follower system, the resultant forces acting on the <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings,</b> and the resisting torque on the camshaft...|$|R
50|$|Like most {{engines of}} the era, the OX-5's {{high-temperature}} areas were built mostly of cast iron, using individual cylinders bolted {{to a single}} aluminum crankcase, wrapped in a cooling jacket made of a nickel-copper alloy. Later versions used a brazed-on steel jacket instead. Cylinder heads were also attached to the crankcase, using X-shaped tie-downs {{on the top of}} the head attached to the block via four long bolts. Fuel was carbureted near the rear of the engine, then piped to the cylinders via two T-shaped pipes, the cylinders being arranged so the intake ports of any two in a bank were near each other. The cylinders had one intake and one exhaust valve, each operated by a pushrod from a camshaft running between the banks. This arrangement caused the outer exhaust valves to have a rather long rocker arm. The pushrods were arranged one inside the other, the exhaust valve rod being on the inside and the intake valve rod a tube around it. The aluminum <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> were a split type bolted together and held in place by lock screws. The pistons were cast aluminum.|$|R
50|$|Where the RC30 {{had used}} roller <b>bearings</b> on the <b>camshafts,</b> the RC45 used more {{conventional}} plain bearings. The RC30 {{had used a}} piston with one compression ring and oil control ring to reduce friction. This was very effective for racing but resulted in increased oil consumption in the road-going bikes. The RC45 changed to the more conventional two compression ring system, also with an oil control ring. It used low friction rings and a molybdenum disulphide coating on smaller piston skirts to reduce friction. One huge change in engine architecture was the change from centre gear drive mechanism to crank/camshaft drive, which was located {{on the end of}} the crankshaft (another NR750 follow on). This reduced the number of engine crankshaft bearings by one and <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> by four with an associated reduction in friction. This overall reduction in friction also allowed the engine to see the higher engine revolutions Honda desired without losing horsepower. The RC45 also followed the RC30 in using titanium connecting rods in a revised format, made lighter and stronger, to help cope with the extra rpm the moving parts of a race engine were expected to see.|$|R
40|$|The {{lubricating}} oil system {{provides a means}} to introduce a lubricant {{in the form of}} a film to reduce friction and wear between surfaces that bear against each other as they move. 1 The oil film which is established also cools the parts by carrying generated heat away from hot surfaces, cleans and carries dirt or metal wear particles to the filter media, and helps seal the piston to the cylinder during combustion. Most systems are pressure lubricated and distribute oil under pressure to bearings, gears, and power assemblies. Lubricating oil usually reaches main, connecting rod, and <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> through drilled passages in the cylinder block and crankshaft or through piping and common manifolds. Many parts rely on oil for cooling, so if the lube oil system fails to perform its function the engine will overheat. Metal to metal surfaces not separated by a thin film of oil rapidly build up frictional heat. As the metals reach their melting point, they tend to weld together in spots or streaks. Lube oil system failures can cause significant damage to an engine in a short period of time. Proper maintenance and operation of the {{lubricating oil}} system is essential if your engine is to accomplish its mission...|$|R

Mercedes-Benz was looking to create a Group B rally car out of its new W201 Chassis (190E Model) {{and turned to the}} expertise of Cosworth to shorten the development time for this project.The request was a huge surprise for Cosworth, and the original brief for a 320 bhp engine based on the 136 bhp Mercedes M102 2.3-litre SOHC 4-cylinder engine was duly passed to Mike Hall, who [...] "drew the famed DFV and BDA engine". Designed around the existing M102 head bolt pattern, the new twin cam, 16-valve, pentroof head, had its valves set at 45° included angle, rather than the 40° angle of the BDA. [...] The valves were the biggest that could be fitted into the combustion chamber. Flat top pistons delivered the 10.5:1 compression ratio. The new Cosworth WAA engine also was Cosworth's first one-piece head, i.e. the camshaft carrier was cast integral with the head itself. Again the constraints of the existing head-bolt pattern meant that Hall had to shift the <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> from outside each pair of camlobes as in the BDA to in between each cylinder's pair of cam lobes.
