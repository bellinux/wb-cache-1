The bouviers bred by them are recorded as having been bred from imports such as Irish wolfhounds and Scottish deerhounds with local farm dogs, until a breed {{considered to be the}} predecessor of the modern Bouvier des Flandres was obtained.

However, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge about who they are, why they do so, and how. This study aimed to explore the life experiences of a group of older people who collect recycling materials for financial return. Methods. A survey method was adopted, in which 82 older people who self-reported that they were motivated to collect recycling materials for financial return were interviewed using a standardised questionnaire. Results. Most of the respondents were female, living with family members, and not economically active during the time of the survey. Approximately 38 % of the respondents indicated that they wanted the money for a living and the remainder regarded it as a perquisite. The majority of the respondents collected recycling materials daily and had done so for 1 to 10 years. About one-third of them reported that they had experienced injury in the process. The resulting median monthly income they derived was reported as HK$ 350. More than 40 % of the respondents said they had to compete with others during the collecting process. Conclusion. Older people who collect recycling materials for financial return were mainly motivated by two factors: to earn money for a living or as a perquisite. Collecting recycling materials was basically like a ‘job’ they undertook frequently, during which they also experienced injury and competition. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

50|$|Type 032-1 is the unarmed {{prototype}} of the Type 032 series, and eventually, {{it is also the}} only one completed among the series. Political upheaval has caused numerous problems in that the subsystems could not be ready because many subsystems delivered was in such poor quality that they were rejected immediately upon inspection. Type 032 is powered by lead batteries used by railway <b>cargo</b> <b>carts.</b> Construction was finally completed in November 1958 at Jiangnan Shipyard, but sea trials had to be conducted at Lushunkou. The reason to select Lushunkou as the test site is because water depth averages only 70 meters in Lushunkou, much shallower than that of Shanghai region, so if accident occurs during sea trials, {{it would be easier to}} carry out rescue missions. In addition, Lushunkou is also the only base in China at the time where Chinese submarine fleet is stationed, and the commander of the base at the time, Major general Liu Huaqing provided great support to the program. In order to make the trip, Type 032-1 had to be first loaded on a barge at Jiangnan Shipyard to be shipped to the Shanghai railway station in the north via Huangpu River. The midget sub was then loaded on a flatbed railway cart to be transported to Lushunkou. Crew to conduct sea trials also traveled by the same cargo train, with a temporary hut built on one of the flatbed carts of the same train. After three days travel by railway, the midget sub reached its destination and was transferred to a pier at the base, with sea trials immediate followed.|$|R

40|$|The town of Vrhnika is {{situated}} in central Slovenia, in the south-western part of the Ljubljana Moor. It boasts numerous natural and cultural sights which {{bear witness to the}} rich history of this »most exceptional« town. The town was growing next to an important crossroad, which influenced its development through various history chapters. Waterborne transport (boating on Ljubljanica River) and land transport (<b>cargo</b> transportation, <b>cart</b> driving, rail traffic) took place in this region. Rare and important remnants are still visible today. The diploma paper contains a short geographic presentation of the municipality, a description of natural and cultural sights and a historical presentation of the town. Special emphasis is placed on the presentation of the traffic situation of Vrhnika and on various transport types that were present in different history periods. The empirical part contains a graphic and textual presentation of the results of a questionnaire which shows how well do the pupils in the fourth and fifth class of grammar school know the transportation types and the means of transport that were used in their home town in different history periods. The final part presents the didactic part that was used in practice in the fourth and fifth class of grammar school. The two lectures took place in the field, that is in the town core of Vrhnika. The pupils were observing the historical remnants, connected to traffic, which helped them solve the exercise sheet and get to know the development of their home town through the history. ...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{historical}} landmark is {{the cottage}} Rockend, where the poet Banjo Paterson {{lived in the}} 1870s and 1880s. It was built circa 1850 and is still preserved {{and open to the}} public in Banjo Paterson Park, Punt Road. It is listed on the Register of the National Estate. The site joins the Bedlam Bay walk, where remnants of the Great North Road exists and the walls of the Bedlam Bay Ferry. Banjo Paterson lived in the sandstone house (now a restaurant) whilst attending Sydney Grammar School. The house was owned by his Grandmother and was frequented by many artists and writers. Banjo Paterson recalled in his radio interview in 1935 the river had declined and was now lined with factories. However he could still remember when;"the wood-boat and the fruit boats, something like 7 ton yachts in size and capacity, would hoist mainsail and jib in the early morning, and come howling down the river with the westerly wind behind them, hoping to get far enough down to meet the north-easter before the wind failed. If the wind died away and they were left in the doldrums - well, they didn’t worry. They anchored and caught themselves feeds of fish which they cooked on their little galley fires, the scent of frying re-bream mixing not unhappily with the aroma of guavas, grapes, and the big hautboy strawberries which now seem to have gone out of fashion. Then, when the tide turned, they would up with the anchor and drift down till they opened up to the harbour where there was always some sort of breeze. They would strike Sydney some time or other, and would deliver their <b>cargo</b> into horse-drawn <b>carts</b> and then point the boat’s nose up river again, back to the gardens and the spitting of fire wood with wedges and American axes." ...|$|R
40|$|RFID Applications {{can be used}} {{to monitor}} and manage the {{movement}} of the finished products throughout a supply chain. RFID tags can be attached directly to the items and materials or they can be attached to the containers that carry them. Pallets, trailers, totes, <b>carts,</b> <b>cargo</b> containers, and reusable transport items can all be tagged. Readers placed throughout a facility can monitor movement and location of inventory, thus providing real time data. Since RFID tags {{can be used to}} identify each individual item, enormous amounts of location-tracking data are generated. With such data, object movements can be modeled by movement graphs, where nodes correspond to locations and edges record the history of item transitions between locations. Especially this study has been taken to develop a movement graph model as a compact representation of RFID data sets. This can be within a warehouse, a freight yard or within a retail location. RFID applications in the supply chain enable more frequent and accurate inventory counts RFID applications in the supply chain can also decrease costs associated with inventory counting. This study show that such a graph can be better organized around gateway nodes, which serve as bridges connecting different regions of the movement graph. objects with RFID tags placed at the item level. Such a retailer sells millions of items per day through thousands of stores around the world, and for each such item, it records the complete set of movements between locations, starting at factories in producing countries, going through the transportation network, and finally arriving at a particular store where the item is purchased by a customer. The complete path traversed by each item can be quite long as readers are placed at very specific locations within factories, ships, and stores (e. g., a production lane, a particular truck, or an individual shelf inside a store). Further, for each object movement, proper-ties such as shipping cost, temperature, and humidity can be recorded...|$|R
