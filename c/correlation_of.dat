A study of Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% reduction in the volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans having suffered no such symptoms. This finding was not replicated in chronic PTSD patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany). A 2016 study strengthened theory that a smaller hippocampus increases the risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, and a larger hippocampus {{increases the likelihood of}} efficacious treatment.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effects of {{non-overlapping}} trading hours on the correlations and cross-serial <b>correlations</b> <b>of</b> returns in non-contemporaneous stock markets and develops a simple formula for calculating contemporaneous correlation measures. The presence of these effects is illustrated empirically using stock market returns data for the U. S., Japan, and the U. K. The results indicate that daily <b>correlations</b> <b>of</b> returns in these markets are biased downward while daily cross-serial <b>correlations</b> <b>of</b> returns are biased upwards. These findings have significant implications for studies investigating the transmission mechanism of stock price innovations across national stock markets and portfolio management (JEL G 15).

The result was subsequently explained by Richard Dalitz and Frank Duarte. Apparently following Dirac's doctrine, Ward was never bothered by issues of interpretation in quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Uranus's {{irregular}} moons {{range in}} size from 120–200km (Sycorax) to about 20km (Trinculo). Unlike Jupiter's irregulars, Uranus's show no <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> axis with inclination. Instead, the retrograde moons can be divided into two groups based on axis/orbital eccentricity. The inner group includes those satellites closer to Uranus (a < 0.15 rH) and moderately eccentric (~0.2), namely Francisco, Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo. The outer group (a > 0.15 rH) includes satellites with high eccentricity (~0.5): Sycorax, Prospero, Setebos, and Ferdinand.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 study {{suggested}} that the <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> tail length and body size in males, wing length in females, and lifespan for both sexes were signs of individual quality, and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals. The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a {{possible explanation for the}} sexual dimorphism.|$|E
50|$|In {{probability}} and statistics, {{the term}} cross-correlations {{is used for}} referring to {{the correlations between the}} entries of two random vectors X and Y, while the <b>correlations</b> <b>of</b> a random vector X are considered to be the correlations between the entries of X itself, those forming the <b>correlation</b> matrix (matrix <b>of</b> <b>correlations)</b> <b>of</b> X. If each of X and Y is a scalar random variable which is realized repeatedly in temporal sequence (a time series), then the <b>correlations</b> <b>of</b> the various temporal instances of X are known as autocorrelations of X, and the cross-correlations of X with Y across time are temporal cross-correlations.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic <b>correlations</b> <b>of</b> quantum observables are {{challenging}} to measure due to measurement backaction incurred at early times. Recent work [P. Uhrich et al., Phys. Rev. A, 96 : 022127 (2017) ] {{has shown that}} ancilla-based noninvasive measurements are able to reduce this backaction, allowing for dynamic <b>correlations</b> <b>of</b> single-site spin observables to be measured. We generalise this result to <b>correlations</b> <b>of</b> arbitrary spin observables and extend the measurement protocol to simultaneous noninvasive measurements which allow for real and imaginary parts <b>of</b> <b>correlations</b> to be extracted from a single set of measurements. We use positive operator-valued measures to analyse the dynamics generated by the ancilla-based measurements. Using this framework we prove that special observables exist for which measurement backaction is of no concern, so that dynamic <b>correlations</b> <b>of</b> these can be obtained without making use of ancillas.

5|$|Another {{important}} experiment {{carried out}} by Wu was the confirmation of the E. M. L.

This was the first experimental confirmation of quantum results relevant {{to a pair of}} entangled photons as applicable to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. Wu later conducted research into the molecular changes in the deformation of hemoglobins that cause sickle-cell disease. She also did research on magnetism, and on the Mössbauer effect during the 1960s. She wrote a textbook with , Beta Decay, which was published in 1966, and became a standard reference on the subject.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{model for}} the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang theory. The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe was extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.|$|E
