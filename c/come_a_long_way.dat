500|$|The {{production}} base for special effects was Century 21 Studios in Slough, Berkshire, {{which had been}} prepared for filming on the last Supermarionation series, The Secret Service.

[...] Unterberger concludes his review by commenting, [...] "The power of the track is greatly enhanced by McCartney's sympathetic high harmonies on the bridge, and its exoticism confirmed by George Harrison's twanging sitar riffs". A reviewer for Rolling Stone magazine noted [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] and [...] "Think for Yourself" [...] as documents of the Beatles' increasing awareness and creativity in the studio. Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork Media considers the song {{to be one of the}} most self-evident Lennon pieces on Rubber Soul to exemplify his maturity as a songwriter, and praises the composition as [...] "an economical and ambiguous story-song highlighted by Harrison's first dabbling with the Indian sitar".|$|E
500|$|Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph {{discussed}} the episode's refreshing strong-women theme: [...] "Game of Thrones has been justly criticised for employing young actresses as wobbly-wobbly window dressing and, though the toplessness has been dialed back this season, it's {{still very much}} a calling card. However there are reasons for suspecting that the series is attempting to make amends – by arguing that Westeros would be far better off with women in charge. Even as Sansa was turning the tide at Winterfell, in Meereen, Daenerys and Yara Greyjoy were striking up a lady bromance – and seemingly rock-solid alliance – for the ages." [...] Laura Prudom of Variety agreed: [...] "After seasons of criticism over the show's misogyny (sometimes earned, sometimes not), it's thrilling to see an episode like 'Battle of the Bastards', where women like Dany, Sansa and Yara — and emasculated men (either figuratively or literally) like Tyrion and Theon — break the gears of war and the familiar patterns of violence by attempting to 'leave the world better than we found it', despite the examples set by the evil white cisgendered men who came before them." [...] According to Sarah Larson of The New Yorker, [...] "Sansa watches calmly, then smiles. You've <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way,</b> baby. Or she's become a monster, and so have I.

Nevertheless, he believed that [...] "Unlike Minogue's early work, this album sounds stronger and has a more natural feel. Her songwriting abilities have <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way,</b> and Impossible Princess actually flows together as an album." [...] Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani awarded it four stars, and {{was impressed with the}} album's [...] "starkly personal and unified cord", saying it [...] "is the work of an artist willing to take risks, not a pop queen concerned with preserving her reign." [...] Cinquemani added it to the staff choices of their Vital Pop: 50 Essential Pop Albums lists. Awarding four stars, Nick Levine from British tabloid Digital Spy commended the mixture of genres and Minogue's input. Although he noticed the material's lack of commercial appeal, he concluded, [...] "Brave, revealing and rarely less than surprising, it's a key piece in the trickier-than-you-think jigsaw puzzle that is Kylie Minogue's recording career."

500|$|Lyrically, Jackson's {{album is}} said to exhibit a [...] "politically driven feminist" [...] message, as stated by Lilly Goren in You've <b>Come</b> <b>A</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Way,</b> Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture (2009). Musically, {{according}} to Rickey Vincent, author of Funk: The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of The One (1996), Jam and Lewis's collaboration with her {{is said to}} be one of the high points of the 1980s, as they redefined dance music by mixing a youthful sound with industrial-strength beats. As documented by musicologist Richard J. Ripani, author of The New Blue Music: Changes in Rhythm & Blues, 1950–1999 (2006), Control is regarded as one of the most influential albums in the history of rhythm and blues and the first album to bridge the gap between R and rap music. Its success in both the mainstream R and pop music charts [...] "led to the incorporation of many of the stylistic traits of rap over the next few years, and Janet Jackson was to continue {{to be one of the}} leaders in that development." [...] Furthermore, the album's second single [...] "Nasty" [...] has been credited with influencing the new jack swing genre, pioneered by Teddy Riley. The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) wrote that the album impacted popular music with a [...] "blockbuster momentum all its own", while Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine noted Control [...] "was every bit the hit machine that her brother's Thriller was." [...] Steve Morse of The Boston Globe commented: [...] "All things considered, 1986 was a stellar year for the black female vocalist—the best, in fact, since the disco era of a decade back... Black music crossed over to the pop charts in dramatic fashion, with Whitney Houston, Patti LaBelle and Janet Jackson each having No. 1 albums." ...|$|E
500|$|On Janet, Jackson began {{focusing}} on sexual themes. Shayne Lee, author of Erotic Revolutionaries: Black Women, Sexuality, and Popular Culture (2010), wrote that her music {{over the following}} decade [...] "brand her {{as one of the}} most sexually stimulating vocalists of the 1990s." [...] In You've <b>Come</b> <b>A</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Way,</b> Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture (1996), Lilly J. Goren observed [...] "Jackson's evolution from politically aware musician to sexy diva marked the direction that society and the music industry were encouraging the dance-rock divas to pursue." [...] The Washington Post declared Jackson's public image over the course of her career had shifted [...] "from innocence to experience, inspiring such carnal albums as 1993's 'Janet' and 1997's 'The Velvet Rope', the latter of which explored the bonds—figuratively and literally—of love and lust." [...] The song [...] "Free Xone" [...] from The Velvet Rope, which portrays same-sex relationships in a positive light, is described by sociologist Shayne Lee as [...] "a rare incident in which a popular black vocalist explores romantic or sensual energy outside the contours of heteronormativity, making it a significant song in black sexual politics." [...] During promotion for Janet, she stated [...] "I love feeling deeply sexual—and don't mind letting the world know. For me, sex has become a celebration, a joyful part of the creative process." [...] Upon the release of Damita Jo, Jackon stated [...] "Beginning with the earlier albums, exploring—and liberating—my sexuality has been an ongoing discovery and theme," [...] adding [...] "As an artist, that's not only my passion, it's my obligation." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine has found Jackson's consistent inclusion of sex in her music lacking ingenuity, especially in comparisons to other artists such as Prince, stating [...] "while sex indisputably fuels much great pop music, it isn't an inherently fascinating topic for pop music—as with anything, it all depends on the artist." ...|$|E
