25|$|A Coast Guard {{investigation}} concluded several {{facts about}} the Marine Sulphur Queen which, by themselves, should have prevented the ship from going to sea at all. The most important were the incidents of fire beneath and {{along the sides of}} the four large sulphur tanks; according to former crewmen these fires were so common that ship's officers gave up sounding the fire alarm. On one occasion the ship sailed into a New Jersey harbor, off-loaded cargo, and sailed out with a fire still burning. When a fire was actually put out, the sulphur would puddle and cake around equipment, once shorting out a major electrical generator. <b>Caked</b> sulphur was also found in spaces below the tanks, due to many cracks in the structure.|$|E
500|$|Firn is {{snow that}} has persisted for {{multiple}} {{years and has}} been recrystallized into a substance denser than névé, yet less dense and hard than glacial ice. Firn resembles <b>caked</b> sugar and is very resistant to shovelling. Its density generally ranges from [...] to , and it can often be found underneath the snow that accumulates {{at the head of}} a glacier. The minimum altitude that firn accumulates on a glacier is called the firn limit, firn line or snowline.|$|E
500|$|The race usually leaves riders <b>caked</b> in mud and grit, {{from the}} cobbled roads and rutted tracks of {{northern}} France's former coal-mining region. However, {{this is not}} how this race earned the name l'enfer du Nord, or Hell of the North. The term was used to describe the route of the race after World War I. Organisers and journalists set off from Paris in 1919 to see how much of the route had survived four years of shelling and trench warfare. Procycling reported: ...|$|E
500|$|Gleeson further {{distinguished}} himself {{later that}} year by assisting in the defence of a trench against enemy attack. [...] He had {{a strong commitment to}} the idea of freeing Belgium from German occupation but was known to be critical of what he considered anti-clerical views held by the French authorities. [...] Gleeson was familiar with the realities of war and, in December 1914, wrote that [...] "if ... advocates of war were made to be soaked and <b>caked</b> and crusted with cold, wet trench mud, like these poor soldiers, and to wear those mud-weighted coats they would not be so glib with their treatises on the art of war. These militants should be made undergo a few nights in cheerless billets [...] mud-river trenches to teach them a lesson. What is it all for at all?".|$|E
500|$|Nests are {{generally}} large and untidy, {{consisting of a}} bowl or platform of sticks lined with grasses, barks, and feathers that can be up to [...] thick. As they are relatively heavy, they are built on larger forks in trees rather than out in the canopy. Building the nest is often time-consuming initially as the birds try (and often fail) to wedge sticks, which are [...] long and [...] thick, into the tree fork to make a platform. Thinner sticks and rootlets are {{used to make the}} bowl before the bowl is lined with feathers. Both birds build the nest, with the female taking over the lining of the nest while the male brings her material. New nests are built each year generally, as the re-use of old ones might spread disease or parasites—nests become <b>caked</b> with faeces as the nestlings grow and the parents cannot keep up with its removal. Furthermore, old nests often disintegrate within twelve months due to their exposed locations. The female develops a brood patch—a patch of bare skin on the bird's underparts that reddens and becomes much more extensive from around three weeks before the first egg is laid. The skin itself is oedematous and wrinkled, and does not get re-feathered until December after the breeding season has finished.|$|E
500|$|The album opens {{out with}} 'Howl', a grinding, but graceful opener. The song starts with an opening {{two minutes of}} intense and spacious drone synthesisers. The {{following}} two minutes of the song break into [...] "unrelenting and brutal" [...] mathcore with Eva Spence making her vocal debut with her [...] "gleefully guttural vocal register". The song is used {{as an example of}} how the band is using more complex, but 'more rewarding' song structures in their music. ‘Ex Luna Scientia’, the opening single for the album is seen as a more expansive and more melodic song in comparison to their previous work, placing emphasis on Eva Spence’s singing rather than her trademark 'guttural' style. Rock Sound reviewer Oliver Robertson used the song as an example for the sonic development of the album as it is [...] "more focused on making each element stand out now, rather than creating simply a cacophony of noise." [...] The introduction to 'Empiresk' is seen as being [...] "completely <b>caked</b> in reverb" [...] and ends with a stoner riff. The [...] "sparse piano chords" [...] that open both 'Empiresk' and 'Prelude II', among the atmospheric breaks that are featured on other tracks on the album defy the aggression featured on the rest of Astraea. Songs like 'The Scales of Balance', 'Remancer' and 'Gloam' are seen as having a fimiliar style to the Rolo Tomassi's previous work. 'Gloam', specifically the last half of the song, showcases a [...] "battle between melodic keyboard and screamed vocals with a real sense of urgency and threat." [...] 'Remancer' specifically has been considered as almost like Mastodon. The album closes with 'Illuminare', a song which Metal Hammer reviewer Merlin Alderslade cites as showing Radiohead and Sigur Rós influences.|$|E

2500|$|The Pigeon Detectives's {{performance}} was also memorable as frontman Matt Bowman informed {{the crowd that}} he was too clean and then asked if anyone in the audience had any mud or muddy trainers that they could throw at him. This request was readily carried out by the crowd. Bowman himself then proceeded to pick up an armful of mud from the stage and rubbed it over his head. Later he ran down to the crowd, inviting fans to rub his hair, whilst {{at the end of their}} popular single [...] "I'm Not Sorry", he jumped off the stage into the crowd. This performance left Stage 2/NME noticeably <b>caked</b> in mud for the rest of the festival.|$|E
2500|$|Ten of {{the lost}} twelve from DeLong's boat were {{discovered}} by Melville on 23 March 1882, and interred on the Lena Delta. [...] Their bodies were marked by a stone cairn constructed locally, then later {{to be returned to}} the United States in 1884. The Jeanette Monument is evocative of the cairn erected by Melville in 1882. [...] It was designed by George Partridge Colvocoresses, drawing instructor at the Academy. It has <b>caked</b> ice draped on the cross, and an antique anchor at the cross's base. The monument is situated near the cemetery's shore with Dorsey Creek, and near the mouth of the creek into the Severn River. [...] Of the twenty names thought to be inscribed, only eleven appear.|$|E
2500|$|Only one {{infantry}} division could be supplied and maintained {{at a distance}} of [...] from railhead, with the camels and wheeled transport allotted to the EEF infantry corps. During the attack on Beersheba the transport of the XXI Corps had been assigned to supply the XX Corps, which marched back to near railhead at Karm after the victory. Here minimal transport was needed so the transport was sent back to the XXI Corps. Many thousands of camels in long lines slowly converged on their allotted areas, before being loaded up for the advance. Motor lorries <b>caked</b> with dust, also drove westwards across the sand and powdered earth. The sleepless drivers' vehicles were then load up before driving off to supply their infantry units.|$|E

2500|$|Reflecting in 2009 on {{the initial}} design, {{the creator of the}} Hayabusa's look, Suzuki's Koji Yoshirua, said that the intent in 1999 was, [...] "to create a {{somewhat}} grotesque design and create a strong initial impact... The mission was to create a total new styling that will not be out of date within few years, and a styling that will be the ‘Face' of Suzuki." [...] Yoshirua also said that the goal was not to achieve the status of fastest production motorcycle, which in early stages was slated to be only , but that, [...] "as a consequence of, pursuing the best handling, acceleration, safety, power, riding ability, original styling, etc., {{for the good of the}} customers, it became the ‘Fastest production motorcycle' … By doing this, once the model was out in the market and the performance of it [...] been proven, I thought that people will start to show interest to the weird design, and then the design would be <b>caked</b> in peoples mind.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Urine {{spraying}} is {{a variable}} behaviour. It may consist of simply dribbling {{a few drops}} of urine, or, large rhythmic discharges from an erect penis. [...] A stream may be aimed at the mane on the neck, or, a fine mist might be [...] sprayed against the stomach. The bull usually rub/palpates during this process. The urine can be voided almost at right angles to the erect penis. When a large volume of urine is sprayed, it usually takes place at a wallow. [...] When urine spraying, the bull lowers his head towards the ground. [...] In this position, his mane becomes soaked as he sprays urine forwards, between his legs. Once the wallow has been created, the male elk lowers himself into the area, rolls on his side and rub his mane on the soaked area of the wallow. He rubs the side of his face, his chest, stomach, legs, and flanks, which all become <b>caked</b> with mud. During wallowing, the elk's penis may remain erect and he may continue to spray urine.|$|E
2500|$|Rainstorms lashed Punchestown {{for much}} of the weekend as the {{campsite}} descended into a muddy wasteland by the Friday evening. [...] By the Saturday afternoon the arena too was <b>caked</b> in mud. Sunday saw the mud worsen with festival-goers finding the long trek between the Main Stage and Stage 2/NME even more difficult as they trudged through knee-deep layers of mud and dirty water. There were some sunny spells but these were eventually replaced with frequent rain showers which drew fans away from the main stages and into the marquees. The mud saw much cause for fun as, in particular during The Kooks's performance on the Main Stage on the Sunday, music fans frolicked in the tedious conditions and sparked off a sequence of raucous mud fights which led to many being bustled away by stewards. Conditions made the car-parks untenable and gardaí eventually took the step on the Saturday morning to shut down all car parks on the Punchestown site, asking those day-trippers who had not yet arrived to avail of the free public transport from Naas. [...] Punchestown Racecourse was later compared to the Somme.|$|E
2500|$|Rain {{during the}} summer had turned soil to mud but the heavier autumn rains created a much longer-lasting variety, a mixture of soil and the chalky subsoil, which became [...] "liquid, yellow-grey mud" [...] which had {{extraordinary}} buoyancy and stuck to everything, covering men and jamming gun mechanisms and rifles. On roads, the mud stuck to wheels and <b>caked</b> the hooves of horses and mules. Men on foot were coated up to the knee and movement off the roads became impossible. Shell craters filled with a quicksand, which could drown soldiers and animals; a French writer called the Somme mud the worst on the Western Front. Engineers laboured all summer to keep roads open and to lay new ones, build corduroy roads of logs and railway sleepers and laid duckboard tracks as the front moved eastwards. The slow Anglo-French advance increased the distance that supplies had to be carried, from the intact road system in the rear to the front line {{on the far side}} of the beaten zone, which brought the transport system close to collapse whenever it rained. More vehicles on the roads accelerated their decrepitude and Bean wrote that many of the lorries broke down and were pushed aside.|$|E
2500|$|In late July 1916 the 1/7th marched {{south to}} begin {{training}} {{to enter the}} ongoing Somme offensive. The battalion practised on positions marked out by flags, and adopted identification stripes on their arms: A Company blue, B Co green, C Co red and D Co yellow. On 15 September, 47th Division attacked High Wood to cover the left flank of the tank-led attack of the adjacent divisions on Flers. The first objective for 140 Bde was a line clear of High Wood (the Switch Line), the second was the Starfish Line on the forward slope, and then the strong Flers Line. [...] The 1/7th and 1/15th were to open the attack, after which the 1/8th would pass through to capture the Starfish Line and finally the 1/6th would pass through and continue to the Flers Line. The 1/7th advanced rapidly behind a creeping barrage and took over 100 prisoners, but suffered severe casualties in taking the Switch Line and consolidating {{just in front of}} it. The battalion was relieved on the evening of 17 September and moved forward to relieve the 1/8th in the Starfish Line, where they were counter-attacked and bombarded for two days. By the time they left the line on 20 September the 'Shiny Seventh' were <b>caked</b> in mud and had suffered over 300 casualties. The regiment was awarded the battle honour Flers-Courcelette.|$|E
2500|$|The Memphis Album {{received}} many favourable reviews. Terry Reilly of The West Australian said, [...] "To Memphis buffs these songs are the Holy Grail and outsiders {{such as the}} Malaysian-born Sebastian are not welcome. But even the hardest followers of songs <b>caked</b> in Memphis mud should bow generously to the subtleties in band performance and the singer's deft use of falsetto and depth of feeling." [...] Bryan Patterson from the Herald Sun wrote, [...] "Even the true Memphis buffs are crowing about Guy Sebastian's excellent work on such songs as Soul Man, Hold On, I'm Comin', In the Midnight Hour and (Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay, accompanied {{by many of the}} revered musicians who played on the originals. Sebastian nails the tunes. He's respectful yet unafraid to inject them with a joyous individuality." [...] In a review on Allmusic, Laurie Mercer said although Sebastian was unable to capture the [...] "nebulous vibe" [...] of the original versions, what he [...] "brings to the table is a wonderful voice, heartfelt respect, and skillful presentation. His range, style, and tone are all remarkable, and his technique so polished that it could be argued (at the risk of being blasphemous) that he occasionally improves on the original recordings". Ian Cuthbertson, a Weekend Australian reviewer wrote, [...] "But some kind of alchemy has happened here. he has lifted his bar to match the talent around him, pulling astonishing, authentic soul performances out of the depths. While his vocal performances are technically amazing, more impressively he has absolutely nailed the rhythm and spirit of the material." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jin forces led by Li Heng (李橫) encircled {{the city}} of De'an ( [...] ; modern Anlu in eastern Hubei) with a force of 10,000, {{established}} around 70 stockades, and set up watch towers to observe enemy movements within the city and relay their positions by fire at night and bright flags by day. Carpenters, smiths, and leatherworkers from nearby areas were forced to construct mobile assault towers called [...] "sky bridges" [...] that could be wheeled to the walls for soldiers to make a frontal assault on the ramparts. In response, the prefect of De'an, Chen Gui (陳規) ordered the garrisons to construct defensive structures atop the walls to hide their movements and protect against enemy arrows and trebuchet projectiles. These were constantly damaged by enemy fire, but were repaired in kind. After defensive structures had been completed, trebuchets were deployed to return fire against Jin siege weapons, damaging them to great effect. The protracted siege forced Jin troops to scour the countryside for food while De'an's moat prevented a direct attack on the city itself. Eventually Jin resorted to using children, women, and the elderly to gather material, including their own bodies, to fill the moat, but this was ultimately unsuccessful as Chen retaliated by firing gunpowder arrows into the moat, burning the wood and straw filling. Jin forces tried again, this time with mud and brick <b>caked</b> filling, and once they deemed the moat sufficiently filled, started their assault. Sky bridges rolled up to the walls under cover of archers and trebuchet fire, but Chen's defenders used long beams {{to keep them from}} getting any closer than ten feet from the walls.|$|E
