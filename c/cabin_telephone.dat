40|$|For {{the past}} decade, our U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) {{research}} team has rummaged through Glacier National Park’s archives looking for records of snow avalanches. Our searches have paid off. We have found photographs that show snow avalanches blocking progress during the annual spring {{opening of the}} famed Going-to-the-Sun Road, ranger logs that describe <b>cabins</b> and <b>telephone</b> lines destroyed by avalanches, and superintendents’ reports that recount avalanche accidents that killed employees or visitors. Recently, we have combined these historical sources with field studies to investigate whether [...] ...|$|R

[...] As a MLA, he was known for advocating positions for Northern British Columbia. [...] He garnered headlines for his tall tale about fighting a grizzly bear.|$|R

It consists of a <b>telephone</b> <b>cabin</b> sculpted {{in the form of}} a flower by the architect Frank Gehry, with no function other than to receive calls from Sophie Calle, the artist who created the idea, in order to accompany the inauguration of the service on Tramway des Maréchaux, whose terminus is very close.|$|R

The first five were alleged {{to have been in}} a getaway car, while Obedeanu was alleged to have been in a <b>telephone</b> <b>cabin,</b> keeping the bank's phone line busy.|$|R
40|$|In Aircraft <b>Cabin,</b> Hands-Free <b>Telephones</b> and Teleconferencing Systems, Noise Cancellers are required, {{which are}} often {{implemented}} by adaptive filters. The correlation between input & noise will slow down the convergence rate of adaptive noise canceller. The new Robust RLS algorithm which proposed here gives the minimization of cost function subject to a time-dependent constraint on the norm of the filter update. We also present some theoretical results regarding the asymptotic behaviour of the various algorithms which gives comparative results for Noise cancellation. The New Robust Recursive Least Square Algorithm (RRLS Algorithm) offers a good {{solution to this problem}} because of its regular adaptation of regularization parameter. RRLS is an adaptive scheme in which regularization parameter is varying by using L 1 Norm. The Performance of the proposed scheme will evaluate in the context of adaptive noise canceller...|$|R

The first bomb caused crowds to gather for help and curiosity, and around 10 minutes later, the second and more powerful bomb exploded, causing many of the casualties. The police believe that the bombs were activated remotely. Political analyst Damla Aras said that, [...] "there is a possibility they might be A4, C-4 explosives, which were brought from northern Iraq by the PKK and have been used several times in Turkey." ...|$|R
