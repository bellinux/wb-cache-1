I explore {{the hypothesis that the}} willingness of suppliers to extend trade credit to their buyers depends on the effectiveness of their collateral.

This effect is more pronounced in countries where suppliers face a higher risk of defaults, and in those where <b>collateral</b> <b>rights</b> and debt enforcement are better. The results, by extension, suggest an asymmetry in finance provision and access to finance across industries, and may shed light on patterns of industry development across countries. 6432 WORDS PLUS 4 SIDES OF TABLES. † I am grateful to my supervisor for countless helpful comments and to Thomas Steger for his help with understanding and rating the effectiveness of collateral in different industries. - 2...|$|R

The theory used in analyzing this {{cancellation of}} the right to land certificate being imposed by the <b>collateral</b> <b>right</b> by the decision of the Supreme Court No. 140 /K/TUN/ 2011 was based on the principles of legal protection developed by Satjipto Raharjo supported by the legal certainty developed by E.

Considering the importance of facial information in gender perception, relatively {{little is known about}} the mechanisms involved in perceiving gender through human facial cues. We used an event-related fMRI repetition suppression paradigm to explore the neural circuitry underlying gender perception from facial information. Participants viewed brief consecutive images consisting of either gender-same face pairings (two male faces or two female faces) or images of gender-different face pairings (a male face preceded or followed by a female face), while attending to facial attractiveness in both conditions.

Such entitlement is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability; and like absolute immunity, it is effectively lot if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial. Accordingly, the reasoning that underlies the immediate appealability of the denial of absolute immunity indicates that the denial of qualified immunity should be similarly appealable under the [...] "collateral order" [...] doctrine; in each case, the district court's decision is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.
