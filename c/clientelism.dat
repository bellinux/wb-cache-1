5|$|It {{was in this}} {{environment}} that the ideology of Ba'athism came into being. The Arab Ba'ath Movement was established by Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar in the 1940s, others who played a notable role {{in the early stages}} of the Ba'athist movement were Zaki al-Arsuzi, Wahib al-Ghanim and Jallal al-Sayyid. Akram al-Hawrani founded the Arab Socialist Party (ASP) in 1953 – the Ba'ath Party was established through a merger of the ASP and the Arab Ba'ath Party. Of the 150 delegates to the founding congress of the Arab Ba'ath Party in 1947, the majority were either middle-class professionals or intellectuals. By the 1950s the party had managed to acquire an urban middle class base. However, the Ba'ath Party was not a purely middle class party, and from the very beginning, it sent party cadres to rural areas to recruit new members and form new party organisations. In 1956, the Ba'ath Party organized the first labour protest in Syrian history. While the Ba'ath Party was strong, its decision to recruit members from across society led to tribalism and <b>clientelism</b> within the party. Party leaders then opted to overlook democratic norms and procedures.|$|E

L'Espresso was characterized from the beginning by an aggressive investigative journalism strongly focussed on corruption and <b>clientelism</b> by the Christian Democrat party. In the 1950s it uncovered major scandals in the health and housing industries. In 1969 Benedetti refounded the weekly newsmagazine Il Mondo, founded by his old friend Mario Pannunzio in 1949, but discontinued in 1966.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Afghanistan, the state-warlord {{bargaining}} sometimes extends beyond these informal accords and elevates {{to the status of}} political <b>clientelism,</b> in which the warlords are appointed to formal government positions, such as regional governor, a title which provides them political legitimacy. It has been shown that during the state-warlord bargaining phase, warlords in Afghanistan have a high motivation to prolong war to create political instability, expose weakness of the central state, prompt regional criticism against the government and continue economic extraction.|$|E
25|$|The Military League, now {{numbering}} about 1,300, {{began by}} engaging in a form of lobbying by putting pressure on those in power. It had already scored a success with the July 1909 resignation of Theotokis, its bête noire and {{a symbol of the}} parliamentary <b>clientelism</b> it hated. But his successor Dimitrios Rallis immediately alienated the League by paying tribute to Constantine’s major role in the war of 1897, by recalling all officers present in Macedonia, by demanding Great Power intervention in Crete and by arresting over a dozen of the League's members for insubordination on 12 August.|$|E
25|$|Through most {{of human}} history {{societies}} {{have been based on}} personal relations: individuals in groups know each other and exchange favors. Today in most lower-income societies hierarchies of groups distribute wealth based on personal relationships among group leaders, a process often linked with <b>clientelism</b> and corruption. Michael Mousseau argues that in this kind of socio-economy conflict is always present, latent or overt, because individuals depend on their groups for physical and economic security and are thus loyal to their groups rather than their states, and because groups are {{in a constant state of}} conflict over access to state coffers. Through processes of bounded rationality, people are conditioned towards strong in-group identities and are easily swayed to fear outsiders, psychological predispositions that make possible sectarian violence, genocide, and terrorism.|$|E
25|$|By 1983, {{membership}} of the PCR had risen to 3.3million, and, in 1989, to 3.7–3.8million—meaning that, in the end, over 20% of Romanian adults were party members, making the PCR the largest communist group of the Eastern Bloc after the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. 64,200 basic party units, answering to county committees, varying in number and representing various areas of Romanian society, were officially recorded in 1980. Statistics also indicated that, during {{the transition from the}} 1965 PMR (with 8% of the total population) to the 1988 PCR, the {{membership of}} workers had grown from 44 to 55%, while that of peasants had dropped from 34 to 15%. In the end, these records contrasted the fact that the PCR had become completely subservient to its leader and no longer had any form of autonomous activity, while membership became a basic requirement in numerous social contexts, leading to purely formal allegiances and political <b>clientelism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Kalligas was a self-declared [...] "child of the 19th century", {{and hence}} proclaimed {{his belief in}} popular sovereignty.

2500|$|There is an {{extensive}} but interesting {{work by the}} American sociologist Susan Stokes about the democratic process in Mar del Plata since 1983 in comparison to other regions of Argentina. [...] One of the main thesis of her articles is that {{the social and economic}} development of Mar del Plata was quite atypical, with a strong prevalence of middle-class values that discouraged the policy of <b>clientelism</b> that is the common background in other urban environments of Argentina.|$|E
2500|$|Especially {{during the}} 1980s, <b>clientelism</b> was further {{enhanced}} {{by a new}} policy, rotația cadrelor ("cadre rotation" [...] or [...] "reshuffling"), placing strain on low-level officials to seek the protection of higher placed ones {{as a means to}} preserve their position or to be promoted. This effectively prompted activists who did not approve of the change in tone to retire, while others—Virgil Trofin, Ion Iliescu and Paul Niculescu-Mizil among them—were officially dispatched to low-ranking positions or otherwise marginalized. In June 1988, the leadership of the Political Executive Committee was reduced from 15 to 7 members, including Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife.|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, {{editorial}} leadership over Sămănătorul {{was assumed}} by Iorga. This moment, Veiga argues, signified {{a change in}} policies and appeal: [...] "Sămănătorul only managed to acquire have its own force when it progressively transformed itself into a catalyst for {{a whole series of}} young discontent intellectuals". Integrated within such changes of discourse, Veiga writes, were Iorga's [...] "fickle" [...] opinions, which had turned into suspicions that the National Liberal Party was endorsing <b>clientelism</b> and a camarilla regime. Despite its growth in influence, the publication had a modest circulation by Romanian standards, reportedly publishing no more than 300 copies per issue. George Călinescu, who indicates that Iorga was trying to link the venue with [...] "a clearer program" [...] and [...] "his own direction", assesses that such goals failed to introduce a fundamentally new approach, and contends that the magazine continued to maintain a [...] "secondary role" [...] when compared other platforms of its kind.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually the CIA's {{involvement}} with the coup was exposed. This caused controversy within the organization and the CIA congressional hearings of the 1970s. CIA supporters maintained that the coup was strategically necessary, and praised {{the efficiency of the}} agents responsible. Critics say the scheme was paranoid, colonial, illegal, and immoral—and truly caused the [...] "blowback" [...] suggested in the pre-coup analysis. The extent of this [...] "blowback," [...] over time, was not completely clear to the CIA, as they had an inaccurate picture of the stability of the Shah's regime. The Iranian Revolution of 1979 caught the CIA and the US very much off guard (as CIA reporting a mere month earlier predicted no imminent insurrectionary turbulence whatsoever for the Shah's regime), and resulted in the overthrow of the Shah by a fundamentalist faction opposed to the US, headed by Ayatollah Khomeini. In retrospect, not only did the CIA and the US underestimate the extent of popular discontent for the Shah, but much of that discontent historically stemmed from the removal of Mosaddegh and the subsequent <b>clientelism</b> of the Shah.|$|E
2500|$|Greece {{had been}} in {{economic}} crisis for decades. Public debt (owed above all to the Great Powers) {{dating back to the}} War of Independence reached new heights in the 1890s. At that point the government of Charilaos Trikoupis recognised that the country was bankrupt by deciding to lower the public debt to 30% of its value, which angered the creditors, particularly the European powers. At the same time, export of the Zante currant entered a crisis. A new phenomenon then began: emigration of the working population. The number of emigrants (especially to the United States) went from 1,108 in 1890 to 39,135 in 1910 (of 2.8 million inhabitants); significantly, remittances from America and Egypt fell amid economic slowdown in 1908. Economic growth was too slow for the workers and farmers who left to seek work elsewhere. Until that time, only highlanders and landless island dwellers had left. However, this economic growth did lead to the creation, as elsewhere in Europe in the same period, of a middle class born out of industrial development, of {{growth in the number of}} bureaucrats (linked to political <b>clientelism)</b> and to an urban explosion. In the mid-1900s, this middle class could not understand why the country was prosperous while the state’s finances were in such poor shape. Politicians, also dissatisfied with government policy, reacted as well. In 1906, a group of youngish radicals nicknamed the [...] "Japanese Group" [...] (Ομάς Ιαπώνων), in reference to the dynamism of the Meiji period, formed around the titular leadership of Stephanos Dragoumis, with Dimitrios Gounaris its moving spirit. It criticised the old oligarchy that was ruining the country and demanded radical reforms. The group of “Sociologists” (Κοινωνιολόγοι), especially influenced by Marxism, also called for modernisation of the state apparatus and the economy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Clientelism</b> as a {{strategy}} of political organisation is substantially different from other strategies which rely on appeals to wider programmatic objectives or simply emphasize higher degrees of competence.

5000|$|<b>Clientelism</b> is the {{exchange}} {{of goods and services}} for political support, often involving an implicit or explicit quid-pro-quo. Clientalism involves an asymmetric relationship between groups of political actors described as patrons, brokers, and clients.

Moreover, <b>clientelism</b> is typified by [...] "exchange systems where voters trade political support for various outputs of the public decision-making process".|$|E

50|$|Expert Lejla Turčilo {{stresses}} {{the fact that}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina, non-transparent media ownership contributes to strengthen a negative characteristic of this society, namely <b>clientelism.</b> Turčilo explains that, as transparency of ownership is not guaranteed, there are cases of media outlets owned by people connected to other businesses that use their media to support such entrepreneurial activities. There are also many cases of media outlets used as political tools. This is confirmed by the Media <b>Clientelism</b> Index, a regional index assessing <b>clientelism</b> and politicization of the media in five countries of the Western Balkans which indicated that Bosnia and Herzegovina suffers a strong influence of political elites over the media. Overall, according to Turčilo, such a media environment cannot provide the public with sufficient and quality information to make an objective assessment of the media contents.|$|E

5000|$|Nicolas Van de Walle {{argues that}} neopatrimonialism is very {{prevalent}} in Africa.

As Joel Migdal puts it, the state in African countries seems omnipresent {{in all aspects of}} people’s lives, from the very local to the central government levels.Van de Walle introduces the notion that in Africa, states are hybrid regimes where patrimonial practices and bureaucracies coexist to a higher or lesser degree. African states have laws and constitutional order and in parallel are ruled by patrimonial logic in which political authority is based on <b>clientelism</b> and office holders constantly appropriate public resources for their own benefit. The dual nature of African regimes means that <b>clientelism</b> is not incidental and cannot be easily corrected with capacity building policies {{and at the same time}} formal structures play an important role, even in the least-institutionalized states.|$|E

50|$|Hallin and Mancini {{identify}} {{the distinction between}} rational-legal authority and <b>clientelism</b> as another crucial dimension. Following Max Weber, Hallin and Mancini use the term rational-legal authority in its meaning {{as a form of}} governance whose main influence is maintained through formal and universalistic rules of procedure, i.e. an independent and autonomous administrative apparatus not affected by political and economic interests or lobbyism. This apparatus is the main institution of an efficient rational-legal system. In contrast, the orientation on common interests is much weaker within <b>clientelism</b> systems because individual interests and private relationships are the main forces maintaining the social organization. Consequently, “access to social resources is controlled by patrons and delivered to clients in exchange for deference and various forms of support”.|$|E
