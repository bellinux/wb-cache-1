5|$|During the Triassic (252–201 Ma), much of Scotland {{remained}} in desert <b>conditions,</b> <b>with</b> higher {{ground in the}} Highlands and Southern Uplands providing sediment to the surrounding basins via flash floods. This is the origin of sandstone outcrops near Dumfries, Elgin and the Isle of Arran. Towards the close of this period sea levels began to rise and climatic conditions became less arid.|$|E
5|$|Octopus blood {{contains}} the copper-rich protein haemocyanin to transport oxygen. This makes the blood very viscous {{and it requires}} considerable pressure to pump it round the body; octopuses' blood pressures can exceed 75 mmHg. In cold <b>conditions</b> <b>with</b> low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen more efficiently than haemoglobin. The haemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma instead of being carried within blood cells, and gives the blood a bluish colour.|$|E

40|$|Metastatic variant sublines of the murine large-cell {{lymphoma}} {{cell line}} RAW 117 were tested for their growth and migration properties in vitro in medium conditioned by soluble factors released from syngeneic mouse liver-, lung-, and brain-derived microvessel endothelial cells. Medium <b>conditioned</b> <b>with</b> hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells stimulated {{the growth of}} highly liver-colonising (RAW 117 -H 10) and highly liver- and lung-colonising (RAW 117 -L 17) sublines at higher rates than the poorly metastatic parental line (RAW 117 -P) (H 10 greater than L 17 greater than P). Medium <b>conditioned</b> <b>with</b> lung microvessel endothelial cells selectively stimulated {{the growth of the}} lung-colonising RAW 117 -L 17 subline. Medium <b>conditioned</b> <b>with</b> brain microvessel endothelial cells showed no growth selectivity, and equivalently stimulated the growth of various RAW 117 cell sublines. Medium <b>conditioned</b> <b>with</b> hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells preferentially promoted the migration of the liver-colonising H 10 and L 17 sublines, and medium <b>conditioned</b> <b>with</b> lung endothelial cells differentially stimulated the migration of the lung-colonising L 17 subline; whereas medium <b>conditioned</b> <b>with</b> brain endothelial cells only slightly stimulated the migration of L 17, but not H 10 or P cells. Fractionation of medium <b>conditioned</b> <b>with</b> hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells by DEAE Sephacel anion exchange chromatography revealed that the growth-stimulating activities were clearly separable from migration-stimulating activities. The growth- and migration-stimulating activities released from organ microvessel endothelial cells may be important in determining the ability of RAW 117 cells to selectively form metastatic colonies in particular organs...|$|R

5|$|Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be {{chlorinated}} under {{free radical}} <b>conditions,</b> <b>with</b> UV light. However, {{the extent of}} chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and {{do not have to be}} distilled out.|$|E

5|$|An {{experimental}} station {{was established to}} grow sugar at Mongalla in the 1950s, and there were plans to establish commercial operations. However, after independence in 1956 the Khartoum government shifted the sugar project to the north, where it is grown under much less favorable <b>conditions</b> <b>with</b> heavy irrigation. A sugar, clothing, and a weaving factory was established in Mongalla in the 1970s but operations failed to get beyond their trial phase and diminished as conflict grew in {{the region in the}} early 1980s. In April 2006 the President of Southern Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla as one of the Nile ports {{to be the first to}} be rehabilitated.|$|E
5|$|At first, the {{depression}} slowly tracked westward {{because it was}} blocked by a ridge of high pressure to the north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and {{the depression}} remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July. The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable <b>conditions</b> <b>with</b> low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Late on July 29, the system began to execute a turn to the northwest {{with an increase in}} forward speed. It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, {{in the more}} {{developed}} parts of the world, animals are often intensively managed; dairy cows may be kept in zero-grazing <b>conditions</b> <b>with</b> all their forage brought to them; beef cattle may be kept in high density feedlots; pigs may be housed in climate-controlled buildings and never go outdoors; poultry may be reared in barns and kept in cages as laying birds under lighting-controlled conditions. In between these two extremes are semi-intensive, often family run farms where livestock graze outside {{for much of the}} year, silage or hay is made to cover the times of year when the grass stops growing, and fertiliser, feed and other inputs are bought onto the farm from outside.|$|E

5|$|Beginning on July9, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began {{dispatching}} aircraft reconnaissance {{to investigate}} {{an area of}} thunderstorms between Yap State and Koror that had potential to develop into a tropical cyclone. Tracking westward, there were few signs of organization or intensification until July12, when recon found a closed atmospheric circulation within the disturbance, signifying that a tropical depression had developed; JTWC bulletins and warnings commenced accordingly. Upon development, observations indicated that the system was quickly developing in favorable <b>conditions,</b> <b>with</b> initial reconnaissance flights finding a loose eye measuring 160km (100mi) in diameter shortly after classification as a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the JTWC upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm status, assigning the name Billie.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Cindy was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to form in the Gulf of Mexico since 1960. The third named storm of the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season, Cindy developed within a trough as a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on 16September. The disturbance swiftly intensified to hurricane strength, with a distinct eye becoming visible on satellite imagery as it drifted north-northwestwards toward the Texas coastline. Despite favorable <b>conditions,</b> <b>with</b> high sea surface temperatures, the storm only intensified into a Category1 hurricane. After peaking with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h), it made landfall at High Island {{on the morning of}} 17September as a slightly weaker system with an atmospheric pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg). Cindy remained nearly stationary for almost a day, dropping copious rainfall over the Texas coastal plain, before finally turning west-southwestward and dissipating west of Corpus Christi on 20September.|$|E
5|$|In a sense, Rule 184 solves this problem, as follows. if Rule 184 is run on {{a finite}} set of cells with {{periodic}} boundary <b>conditions,</b> <b>with</b> an unequal number of 0s and 1s, then each cell will eventually see two consecutive states of the majority value infinitely often, but will see two consecutive states of the minority value only finitely many times.
