5|$|The {{available}} sources give no <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> Albin's {{pattern of}} allegiance in these factional politics, {{and neither do}} his recorded activities.

Watt even argued that Albin's postulation was {{probably due to the}} influence of Alan Durward, who at the time was a close advisor of King Alexander II.|$|E

5|$|The gilded {{monogram}} initials on the Library punchbowl {{are perhaps}} the only current <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the original commissioner of the punchbowls. The initials are difficult to decipher because of partial loss of the gilt Copperplate script. Possibilities include HCA or HA, TCA or FCA over B. Several candidates have been suggested including Henry, 3rd Earl of Bathurst, and Sir Thomas Brisbane, New South Wales Governor in 1821–1825 after Lachlan Macquarie, but the most likely is Henry Colden Antill (1779–1852). Antill was appointed aide-de-camp to the fifth New South Wales Governor, Macquarie who was in office 1810–1821, on his arrival in Sydney on 1January 1810. He was promoted to Major of Brigade in 1811 and retired from the British Army in 1821. Antill settled on land first at Moorebank near Liverpool and then in 1825 on his estate near Picton—named Jarvisfield in honour of Macquarie's first wife, Jane Jarvis. He was buried at Jarvisfield on 14August 1851. Antill had subdivided part of the estate in 1844, making possible {{the founding of the}} town of Picton. When the State Library acquired its punchbowl in 1926, the Antill family of Picton — Henry's antecedents — had no knowledge of the punchbowl's provenance.|$|E

25|$|A first <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> {{the actual}} {{complexity}} {{of the system of}} coagulation was the discovery of proaccelerin (initially and later called Factor V) by Paul Owren (1905–1990) in 1947.

25|$|A {{construction}} slab {{identifies the}} Legio XX Valeria Victrix (Twentieth Legion) as having built the fort, but as is usual, this gives no real <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> when the fort was actually built.

25|$|There {{are very}} few {{historical}} details in the Book of Malachi. The greatest <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> its dating {{may lie in the}} fact that the Persian-era term for governor (pehâ) is used in 1:8. This points to a post-exilic date of composition both because of the use of the Persian period term and because Judah had a king before the exile. Since, in the same verse, the temple has been rebuilt, the book must also be later than 515BC. Malachi was apparently known to the author of Ecclesiasticus early in the 2nd century BC. Because of the development of themes in the book of Malachi, most scholars assign it to a position between Haggai and Zechariah, slightly before Nehemiah came to Jerusalem in 445BC.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not clear}} whether Arrúe has {{inherited}} Traditionalist outlook from his ancestors – like most Carlists in Basque-Navarrese area have – or whether he embraced it during the schooling and academic years. None of the sources consulted offers also any <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> which branch of the movement he joined in the 1920s, the Jaimistas, the Mellistas or the Integristas, though it is the latter group which seems most probable. Asteasu was in the very centre of the Integrist national stronghold, composed of Tolosa and Azpeitia districts; an Anastasio Arrúe was jefe of the local Tolosan Integrist junta, and a Pedro Arrúe was its treasurer; Antonio’s father as an organist was closely related to the parochial clergy; finally, in the early 1930s Antonio commenced collaboration with , the local Gipuzkoan Integrist daily, later editing its newly introduced section in Basque.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to light, {{physical}} damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content {{within the}} tuber. Cooking at high temperatures—over —partly destroys these compounds. The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes suffices to produce toxic effects in humans. Glycoalkaloids may cause headaches, diarrhea, cramps, and in severe cases coma and death; however, poisoning from potatoes occurs very rarely. Light exposure causes greening from chlorophyll synthesis, thus giving a visual <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> {{areas of the}} tuber that may have become more toxic; however, this {{does not provide a}} definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other. Varieties contain different levels of glycoalkaloids. The Lenape variety was released in 1967 but was withdrawn in 1970 as it contained high levels of glycoalkaloids. Since then breeders developing new varieties test for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising cultivar.|$|E

500|$|The {{texts of}} Mari {{show that the}} cult of stones, {{especially}} the [...] "sikkanum" [...] (i.e., Betyles—sacred stones), was widespread in western Syria, and its practice in Qatna is plausible. Du Mesnil du Buisson named room F in the royal palace [...] "Haut-Lieu" [...] and considered it a shrine of Ašera. Research done after 1999 ruled out du Mesnil du Buisson's hypothesis {{and concluded that the}} room is a bathroom, but further research showed that the bathroom interpretation must also be wrong. Pfälzner, based on its architecture being suitable for containing sacred stones, suggested that room F was the palace shrine for the cult of Betyles. Pfälzner concludes that [...] "an ultimate proof, however, for the function of Room F at Qaṭna cannot be deduced from this parallel. Nor is there a <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the dedication of the possible Betyle-sanctuary at Qaṭna".|$|E
500|$|The sermons of Photius {{offer no}} <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> {{the outcome of}} the {{invasion}} or the reasons why the Rus' withdrew to their own country. Later sources attribute their retreat to the Emperor's speedy return to the capital. As the story goes, after Michael and Photius put the veil of the Theotokos into the sea, there arose a tempest which dispersed the boats of the barbarians. In later centuries, it was said that the Emperor hurried to the church at Blachernae and had the robe of the Theotokos carried in procession along the Theodosian Walls. This precious Byzantine relic was dipped symbolically into the sea and a great wind immediately arose and wrecked the Rus' ships. The pious legend was recorded by George Hamartolus, whose manuscript was an important [...] source for the Primary Chronicle. The authors of the Kievan chronicle appended the names of Askold and Dir to the account as they believed that these two Varangians had presided over Kiev in 866. It was to this year that (through some quirk in chronology) they attributed the first Rus' expedition against the Byzantine capital.|$|E
