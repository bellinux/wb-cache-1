25|$|A tightly {{spun wool}} yarn made from fibre {{with a long}} staple length in it is called worsted. It is hand spun from combed top, and the fibres all lie in the same {{direction}} as the yarn. A woollen yarn, in contrast, is hand spun from a rolag or other <b>carded</b> <b>fibre</b> (roving, batts), where the fibres are not as strictly aligned to the yarn created. The woollen yarn, thus, captures much more air, and makes for a softer and generally bulkier yarn. There are two main techniques to create these different yarns: short draw creates worsted yarns, and long draw creates woollen yarns. Often a spinner will spin using a combination of both techniques and thus make a semi-worsted yarn.|$|E
2500|$|Such spinners {{generally}} {{buy their}} fibres pre-washed and carded, {{in the form}} of roving, sliver, or batts. This means less work for the spinners, as {{they do not have to}} wash out the lanolin. Spinners then have available predyed fibre, or blends of fibres, which are hard to create when the wool is still in the grease. As machine carders cannot card wool in the grease, pre-carded yarn generally is not spun in the grease. Some spinners use spray-on lanolin-like products to get the same feel of spinning in the grease with <b>carded</b> <b>fibre.</b>|$|E

50|$|The term host {{bus adapter}} (HBA) {{is most often}} {{used to refer to}} a <b>Fibre</b> Channel {{interface}} <b>card.</b> <b>Fibre</b> Channel HBAs are available for open systems, computer architectures, and buses, including PCI and SBus (obsolete today). Each HBA has a unique World Wide Name (WWN), which is similar to an Ethernet MAC address in that it uses an OUI assigned by the IEEE. However, WWNs are longer (8 bytes).There are two types of WWNs on a HBA; a node WWN (WWNN), which is shared by all ports on a host bus adapter, and a port WWN (WWPN), which is unique to each port. There are HBA models of different speeds: 1Gbit/s, 2Gbit/s, 4Gbit/s, 8Gbit/s, 10Gbit/s, 16Gbit/s and 20Gbit/s.|$|R
50|$|Hand {{spinning}} {{can be done}} {{by using}} a spindle or the spinning wheel. Spinning turns the <b>carded</b> wool <b>fibres</b> into yarn which can then be directly woven, knitted (flat or circular), crocheted, or by other means turned into fabric or a garment.|$|R
40|$|Colour {{matching}} between carded {{and finished}} fibres {{is an important}} challenge for textile industry. The straightforward approach for mixing together some differently coloured fibres {{in order to obtain}} a blend of a desired colour is to perform a trial and error approach starting from a given colour recipe and optimizing it with several attempts. Unfortunately, dyeing process so as the carding procedure may result in a <b>carded</b> <b>fibre</b> whose colour is different from the desired one. As a consequence textile companies have to modify the original recipe {{in order to reduce the}} gap between the colour of the final product and the desired one. The present work describes a model able to simulate the colour mixing of fibres in order to assess the best recipe. The model consists in two modules: a “prediction module” predicts the colour of a blend obtained by mixing together several fibres; an “optimization module” is used to optimize the final recipe. The devised system has been tested for optimizing the recipe of a set of 200 blends. The mean error in predicting the blend colour is about 15 % with a variance of 0. 165. The time for optimizing the recipe is reduced by 92 %...|$|E
50|$|After <b>carding,</b> the <b>fibres</b> lie roughly {{parallel}} in smooth bundles. These are drawn out, by hand or machine, and slightly twisted to form lengths suitable for spinning. These unspun strands of fibre are the rovings. Roving can also mean {{a roll of}} these strands, the strands in general (as a mass noun), or {{the process of creating}} them.|$|R

40|$|The {{extraction}} of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) from Carmagnola hemp fibres {{has been carried}} out. Before CNC extraction, the effectiveness of two pre-treatment methods, an alkaline chemical and a pectinase enzymatic treatment, applied on the pristine and <b>carded</b> hemp <b>fibres,</b> were compared. <b>Carding</b> allowed removal of most impurities from the fibres, while it had only a modest effect on their structure. After chemical treatment, hemicellulose was removed, more efficiently in carded hemp, and X-ray diffraction suggests {{an increase in the}} size of cellulose crystallites. <b>Carded</b> hemp <b>fibres,</b> after interaction with pectinase, show the total decomposition of pectin and hemicellulose. On the basis of these results, carded hemp was selected as start material for CNC extraction and the acid hydrolysis for CNC synthesis was applied on carded hemp after both chemical and enzymatic procedures. The yield of the different hydrolysis methods remains approximately at the same level (around 19 %) : on the other side, a carding procedure, combined with an alkaline treatment to hemp fibres, represents an optimized process for CNC extraction by acid hydrolysis. © 2014 Elsevier B.

50|$|Textile {{manufacturing}} involves converting {{of three}} types of fibre into yarn, then fabric, then textiles. These are then fabricated into clothes or other artifacts. Cotton {{was the most important}} natural fibre, but there was a sizeable Worsted industry in neighbouring West Yorkshire. Cotton was harvested, ginned and transported Britain in bales. At the factories the bales were broken open, the fibres were willowed and scrutched before being <b>carded.</b> The <b>carded</b> <b>fibres</b> were combed, drawn, slubbed and roved before they were ready to be spun. Spinning was done on a spinning mule. Before mechanisation each process was done by hand, but as 19th progressed mechanization was introduced. From 1857, Platts supplied the complete range of spinning and weaving machinery. It surpassed Dobson & Barlow of Bolton in size in 1854. Platts constructed looms for export from 1857. Platts introduced successive models of carding machines, roving frames and self-acting mules in 1868, 1886 and 1900. The self-acting mule was the basis of the company's success being faster, longer and more productive than those of their rivals. Workmen in Platts became shareholders in the Oldham Limiteds mills on the late 1860s ensuring Platt machinery was purchased.|$|R
50|$|Because it is <b>carded,</b> the <b>fibres</b> {{are less}} {{parallel}} than top (which is combed) {{and are not}} of uniform length. Carded rovings look fluffier than combed top, which looks smooth and has a high lustre. The fibres in combed top tend to be of a fairly uniform length due to the method of preparation. Though drawing it into strips may line the fibres up a bit. Roving {{is not to be}} confused with sliver as there is twist in roving.|$|R
25|$|Before the 1770s, textile {{production}} was {{a cottage industry}} using flax and wool. Weaving was a family activity. The children and women would <b>card</b> the <b>fibre</b> — break up and clean the disorganized fluff into long bundles. The women would then spin these rough rovings into yarn wound on a spindle. The male weaver would use a frame loom to weave this into cloth. This was then tentered in the sun to bleach it. The invention by John Kay of the flying shuttle made the loom twice as productive, causing the demand for cotton yarn to vastly exceed what traditional spinners could supply.|$|R
50|$|Raw fibre, {{placed on}} the in-feed table or {{conveyor}} is moved to the nippers which restrain and meter the fiber onto the swift. As they are transferred to the swift, many of the fibres are straightened and laid into the swift's <b>card</b> cloth. These <b>fibres</b> will be carried past the worker / stripper rollers to the fancy.|$|R
50|$|In a wider sense carding {{can refer}} to the four {{processes}} of willowing, lapping, carding and drawing. During willowing the fibres are loosened; in lapping the dust is removed to create a flat sheet or lap of <b>fibres.</b> <b>Carding</b> combs the tangled lap into a thick rope or sliver of 1/2 inch in diameter, and removes the shorter fibres creating a stronger yarn.|$|R
5000|$|Wool {{refers to}} the hair of the {{domestic}} goat or sheep, which is distinguished from other types of animal hair in that the individual strands are coated with scales and tightly crimped, and the wool {{as a whole is}} coated with a wax mixture known as lanolin (sometimes called wool grease), which is waterproof and dirtproof [...] Woollen refers to a bulkier yarn produced from <b>carded,</b> non-parallel <b>fibre,</b> while worsted refers to a finer yarn spun from longer fibres which have been combed to be parallel. Wool is commonly used for warm clothing. Cashmere, the hair of the Indian cashmere goat, and mohair, the hair of the North African angora goat, are types of wool known for their softness.|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} machine carder is {{the drum}} carder. Most drum carders are hand-cranked {{but some are}} powered by electric motor. These machines generally have two rollers, or drums, covered with card clothing. The licker-in, or smaller roller meters fibre from the infeed tray onto the larger storage drum. The two rollers are connected to each other by a belt- or chain-drive so that their relative speeds cause the storage drum to gently pull fibres from the licker-in. This pulling straightens the fibres and lays them between the wire pins of the storage drum's <b>card</b> cloth. <b>Fibre</b> is added until the storage drum's card cloth is full. A gap in the card cloth facilitates removal of the batt when the card cloth is full.|$|R

40|$|International audienceCultivated {{primarily}} for its seeds, oleaginous flax {{could also be}} valued for the different fractions that can be extracted from the straw. However, as the straws are not harvested with the same technique and care than for the textile flax, the classical scutching technique cannot be used. As a consequence, an “all fibre” device was used to perform {{the separation of the}} different constituents of the oleaginous flax straws. The different fractions were quantified for two retting levels and for two degrees of rewetting of the stems. The physical and mechanical properties of fibres were then evaluated. It appears that the relative amount of fibres extracted from oleaginous flax straw is comparable to the one from textile flax (i. e. 40 % of the stem dry mass), and their tensile properties are situated in {{the lower part of the}} textile flax range. This work shows that the individual fibre length of oleaginous flax (between 3 and 6 cm) is comparable to that of the scutched textile flax fibres. This makes them suitable for the production of <b>carded</b> aligned <b>fibre</b> yarns for technical reinforcement textiles (e. g. composites or geotextiles). These results demonstrate the interest and the potential added value of harvesting the stems for technical fibre applications...|$|R

The same production system was attempted with cotton, but the demand was too high, and with the invention by John Kay of the flying shuttle, which made the loom twice as productive, more cotton yarn was being woven than the traditional spinners could supply.There were two types of spinning wheel: the Simple Wheel, which uses an intermittent process, and the more refined Saxony wheel, which drives a differential spindle and flyer with a heck (an apparatus that guides the thread to the reels) in a continuous process. These two wheels became {{the starting point of}} technological development. Businessmen such as Richard Arkwright employed inventors to find solutions that would increase the amount of yarn spun, then took out the relevant patents. The spinning jenny allowed a group of eight spindles to be operated together. It mirrored the simple wheel; the rovings were clamped and a frame moved forward stretching and thinning the roving. A wheel was rapidly turned as the frame was pushed back, and the spindles rotated, twisted the rovings into yarn and collecting it on the spindles.|$|R
40|$|Carding is an {{essential}} pre-spinning process whereby masses of dirty tufted fibres are cleaned, disentangled and refined into a smooth coherent web. Research and development in this `low-technology' industry have hitherto depended on empirical evidence. In collaboration with the School of Textile Industries at the University of Leeds, a mathematical theory has been developed that describes the passage of <b>fibres</b> through the <b>carding</b> machine. The <b>fibre</b> dynamics in the carding machine are posed, modelled and simulated by three distinct physical problems: the journey of a single fibre, the extraction of fibres from a tuft or tufts and many interconnecting, entangled fibres. A description {{of the life of}} a single fibre is given as it is transported through the <b>carding</b> machine. Many <b>fibres</b> are sparsely distributed across machine surfaces, therefore interactions with other neighbouring fibres, either hydrodynamically or by frictional contact points, can be neglected. The aerodynamic forces overwhelm the fibre's ability to retain its crimp or natural curvature, and so the fibre is treated as an inextensible string. Two machine topologies are studied in detail, thin annular regions with hooked surfaces and the nip region between two rotating drums. The theoretical simulations suggest that fibres do not transfer between carding surfaces in annular machine geometries. In contrast to current carding theories, which are speculative, a novel explanation is developed for fibre transfer between the rotating drums. The mathematical simulations describe two distinct mechanisms: strong transferral forces between the taker-in and cylinder and a weaker mechanism between cylinder and doffer. Most <b>fibres</b> enter the <b>carding</b> machine connected to and entangled with other fibres. Fibres are teased from their neighbours and in the case where their neighbours form a tuft, which is a cohesive and resistive fibre structure, a model has been developed to understand how a tuft is opened and broken down during the carding process. Hook-fibre-tuft competitions are modelled in detail: a single fibre extracted from a tuft by a hook and diverging hook-entrained tufts with many interconnecting fibres. Consequently, for each scenario once fibres have been completely or partially extracted, estimates can be made as to {{the degree to which a}} tuft has been opened-up. Finally, a continuum approach is used to simulate many interconnected, entangled fibre-tuft populations, focusing in particular on their deformations. A novel approach describes this medium by density, velocity, directionality, alignment and entanglement. The materials responds to stress as an isotropic or transversely isotropic medium dependent on the degree of alignment. Additionally, the material's response to stress is a function of the degree of entanglement which we describe by using braid theory. Analytical solutions are found for elongational and shearing flows, and these compare very well with experiments for certain parameter regimes...|$|R
