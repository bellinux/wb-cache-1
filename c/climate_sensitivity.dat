25|$|Atmospheric GHG {{concentrations}} can {{be related}} to changes in global mean temperature by the <b>climate</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Projections of future global warming are affected by different estimates of <b>climate</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> For a given increase in the atmospheric concentration of GHGs, high estimates of <b>climate</b> <b>sensitivity</b> suggest that relatively more future warming will occur, while low estimates of <b>climate</b> <b>sensitivity</b> suggest that relatively less future warming will occur. Lower values would correspond with less severe climate impacts, while higher values would correspond with more severe impacts.|$|E

25|$|Without climate feedbacks, a {{doubling}} in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration {{would result in}} a global average temperature increase of around 1.2°C.

40|$|International audienceCurrent {{scientific}} knowledge {{on the future}} response of the climate system to human-induced perturbations is comprehensively captured by various model intercomparison efforts. In {{the preparation of the}} Fourth Assessment Report (AR 4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), intercomparisons were organized for atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) and carbon cycle models, named "CMIP 3 " and "C 4 MIP", respectively. Despite their tremendous value for the scientific community and policy makers alike, there are some difficulties in interpreting the results. For example, key radiative forcings have not been considered or standardized in the majority of AOGCMs integrations and carbon cycle runs. Furthermore, the AOGCM analysis of plausible emission pathways was restricted to only three SRES scenarios. This study attempts to address these issues. We present an updated version of MAGICC, the simple carbon cycle-climate model used in past IPCC Assessment Reports with enhanced representation of time-varying <b>climate</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> carbon cycle feedbacks, aerosol forcings and ocean heat uptake characteristics. This new version of MAGICC (6. 0) is successfully calibrated against the higher complexity AOGCM and carbon cycle models. Parameterizations of MAGICC 6. 0 are provided. Previous MAGICC versions and emulations shown in IPCC AR 4 (WG 1, Fig. 10. 26, page 803) yielded, in average, a 10 % larger global-mean temperature increase over the 21 st century compared to the AOGCMs. The reasons for this difference are discussed. The emulations presented here using MAGICC 6. 0 match the mean AOGCM responses to within 2. 2 % for the SRES scenarios. This enhanced emulation skill is due to: the comparison on a "like-with-like" basis using AOGCM-specific subsets of forcings, a new calibration procedure, as well as the fact that the updated simple climate model can now successfully emulate some of the climate-state dependent effective <b>climate</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of AOGCMs. The mean diagnosed effective <b>climate</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the AOGCMs is 2. 88 °C, about 0. 33 °C cooler than the reported slab ocean <b>climate</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> Finally, we examine the combined climate system and carbon cycle emulations for the complete range of IPCC SRES emission scenarios and some lower mitigation pathways...|$|R

(2008) (referred to by World Bank, 2010:8) {{examined}} {{the sensitivity of}} the optimal climate target to assumptions about the time horizon, <b>climate</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> mitigation costs, likely damages, and discount rates. The optimal target was defined as the concentration that would result in the lowest reduction in the present value (i.e., discounted) of global consumption. A set of assumptions that included a relatively high <b>climate</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (i.e., a relatively large global temperature increase for a given increase in GHGs), high damages, a long time horizon, low discount rates (i.e., future consumption is valued relatively highly), and low mitigation costs, produced an optimum peak in the concentration of CO2e at 540 parts per million (ppm).

40|$|Anthropogenic {{emissions}} {{of greenhouse gases}} could lead to undesirable effects on oceans in coming centuries. Drawing on recommendations published by the German Advisory Council on Global Change, levels of unacceptable global marine change (so-called guardrails) are defined in terms of global mean temperature, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. A global-mean climate model [the Aggregated Carbon Cycle, Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model (ACC 2) ] is coupled with an economic module [taken from the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy Model (DICE) ] to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to derive CO 2 emission pathways that both minimize abatement costs and are compatible with these guardrails. Additionally, the. tolerable windows approach. is used to calculate a range of CO 2 emissions paths that obey the guardrails as well as a restriction on mitigation rate. Prospects of meeting the global mean temperature change guardrail (2 and 0. 2 degrees C per decade relative to preindustrial) depend strongly on assumed values for climate sensitivity: at <b>climate</b> <b>sensitivities</b> > 3 degrees C the guardrail cannot be attained under any CO 2 emissions reduction strategy without mitigation of non-CO 2 greenhouse gases. The ocean acidification guardrail (0. 2 unit pH decline relative to preindustrial) is less restrictive than the absolute temperature guardrail at <b>climate</b> <b>sensitivities</b> > 2. 5 degrees C but becomes more constraining at lower <b>climate</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> The sea level rise and rate of rise guardrails (1 m and 5 cm per decade) are substantially less stringent for ice sheet sensitivities derived in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report, but they may already be committed to violation if ice sheet sensitivities consistent with semiempirical sea level rise projections are assumed...|$|R

25|$|Hansen et al. 2013 {{suggests}} that the Earth could become in large parts uninhabitable and note that this may not even require burning of all fossil fuels, because of higher <b>climate</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (3–4°C or 5.4–7.2°F) based on a 550 ppm scenario.

25|$|Global warming of that {{magnitude}} {{would make}} {{most of the}} planet uninhabitable by humans. The human body generates about 100 W of metabolic heat that must be carried away to maintain a core body temperature near 37°C, which implies that sustained wet bulb temperatures above 35°C can result in lethal hyperthermia. Today, the summer temperature varies widely over the Earth's surface, but wet bulb temperature is more narrowly confined by the effect of humidity, with the most common value of approximately 26–27°C and the highest approximately of 31°C. A warming of 10–12°C would put most of today's world population in regions with a wetbulb temperature above 35°C. Given the 20°C warming that occurs with 4.8 times current CO2 levels, such a climate forcing would produce intolerable climatic conditions even if the true <b>climate</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is significantly less than the Russell sensitivity, or, if the Russell sensitivity is accurate, the CO2 forcing required to produce intolerable conditions for humans is less than this amount.|$|E
