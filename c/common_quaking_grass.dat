50|$|The site is chalk {{grassland}} {{which has a}} diverse flora. The main grasses are red fescue, <b>quaking</b> <b>grass</b> and yellow oat grass. Orchids include the common spotted and pyramidal, and the profusion of chalk flowers and its south facing location make the site important for bees, grasshoppers and butterflies.|$|R
5|$|Grass and shrub seeds {{form the}} bulk of the diet, and leaves, flowers, fruit and scale insects are also eaten. The {{turquoise}} parrot has been recorded feeding on seeds of various plant species; more commonly consumed items include the fruit of common fringe-myrtle (Calytrix tetragona), seeds and fruit of erect guinea-flower (Hibbertia riparia), daphne heath (Brachyloma daphnoides), seeds of common raspwort (Gonocarpus tetragynus), Geranium species, black-anther flax-lily (Dianella revoluta) and grass species such as the introduced big <b>quaking</b> <b>grass</b> (Briza maxima) and little <b>quaking</b> <b>grass</b> (B. minor) and members of the genus Danthonia, members of the pea genus Dillwynia, and small-leaved beard-heath (Leucopogon microphyllus).

50|$|The {{grassland}} is semi-natural and {{the dominant}} species is upright brome. Also recorded are <b>quaking</b> <b>grass,</b> cock's foot, cowslip and other limestone herbs. Significant numbers of orchids flourish {{on the site}} including musk orchid, but these are threatened by invasion of scrub such as hawthorn. Yew, whitebeam and juniper are scattered on the site.|$|R
50|$|This well drained {{hay meadow}} on boulder clay is {{traditionally}} managed, and no artificial fertilisers or herbicides have been used, {{so it has}} a diverse flora. More than twenty grass species have been recorded, including sweet vernal, Yorkshire fog, sheep's fescue, <b>quaking</b> <b>grass</b> and crested dog's-tail. There is also a population of the locally rare green-winged orchid.|$|R

50|$|The {{site is a}} {{triangular}} meadow in the corner where two railway lines merge. It was cut off when the railways were constructed in the 1850s, and at the northern end there are traces of the ancient ridge and furrow method of ploughing. The site has {{a wide range of}} flowers, such as cowslip, salad burnet and <b>quaking</b> <b>grass.</b> A small stream and hedgerows provide additional habitats for wildlife.|$|R
50|$|On {{unit of the}} site, a {{dip slope}} east of Allolee has poor drainage, which {{supports}} a 'most unusual' species-rich grassland dominated by purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) and having <b>quaking</b> <b>grass,</b> meadow oat-grass, spring sedge (Carex caryophyllea), glaucous sedge (C. flacca), tawny sedge (C. hostiana), flea sedge (C. pulicaris), lady’s mantle (Alchemilla filicaulis), lady’s bedstraw (Galium verum), fairy flax (Linum catharticum), cowslip (Primula veris), devil’s-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), greater burnet and wild thyme.|$|R
50|$|The {{grassland}} plateau supports tor-grass, upright brome, sheep's fescue and <b>quaking</b> <b>grass.</b> This area {{is relatively}} short {{as it is}} grazed and there is recreational use. The slopes support a higher sward {{and this is the}} area for insect life. Herbs recorded include chalk milkwort, clustered bellflower, kidney vetch and autumn gentian. There are several species of orchid which include frog orchid, bee orchid and musk orchid. The rare pasqueflower is recorded at this site.|$|R
50|$|Where a {{skeletal}} soil layer has developed on the quarry floor and spoil heaps, patches of grassland occur, with species characteristic of base-rich soils, such as <b>quaking</b> <b>grass,</b> Briza media, and limestone bedstraw, Galium sterneri. On shallow slopes, this {{gives way to}} a neutral grassland characterised by false oat-grass, Arrhenatherum elatius, and Yorkshire fog, Holcus lanatus. Above the quarry, this is replaced by acid grassland, in which wavy hair-grass, Deschampsia flexuosa, is dominant.|$|R
5000|$|The site {{supports}} a [...] "very {{large number of}} plant species" [...] on the wetter fen areas. Dominant species tend to be black bog rush Schoenus nigricans, saw sedge Cladium mariscus and purple moor grass Molinia caerulea, with species such as fen orchid Dactylorchis praetermissa, devil’s bit scabious Succisa pratensis, long-stalked yellow sedge Carex lepidocarpa, <b>quaking</b> <b>grass</b> Briza media, parnassus Parnassia palustris {{and a number of}} rare mosses also found in these areas.|$|R
50|$|Hunsdon Mead {{is located}} between the River Stort and the Stort Navigation. It is {{unimproved}} grassland which {{is subject to}} winter flooding. As {{a result of its}} location and traditional management it supports a number of uncommon plants. Notable grass species include meadow brome and the <b>quaking</b> <b>grass</b> briza media, and there are other unusual flora such as pepper saxifrage and green-winged orchid. Roydon Mead lies east of the Stort Navigation, and both have large flocks of over-wintering birds.|$|R
50|$|The site {{consists}} of unimproved species-rich chalk grassland {{on the edge}} of Salisbury Plain, parts of it with over forty plant species per square metre, and supports some uncommon butterflies. Its slopes of the Lower Chalk mostly face south-west, and there are two combes. The sward is notable for upright brome (Bromus erectus) and sheep’s fescue (Festuca ovina). Other plants include <b>quaking</b> <b>grass!</b> crested hair-grass, Bird’s-foot-trefoil, dwarf thistle, small scabious (Scabiosa columbaria) and hoary plantain (Plantago media).|$|R

50|$|The hill {{slopes and}} former quarry support an {{extensive}} area of primary magnesian limestone grassland. Blue moor-grass, Sesleria albicans, a characteristic plant of such grassland, is present but not {{abundant in the}} primary grassland on the hill slopes, where herbs such as rock-rose, Helianthemum nummularium, are more common; blue moor-grass is more plentiful in the secondary grassland on the quarry floor and spoil heaps, where it is associated with species such as <b>quaking</b> <b>grass,</b> Briza media, salad burnet, Sanguisorba minor, and autumn gentian, Gentianella amarella.|$|R
