5|$|However, in one scene, a Pawnee {{character}} {{is accompanied by}} a voiceover in Inupiak, which is spoken in Arctic Alaska, thousands of kilometers away and a different language family from Pawnee. The voiceover was taken from a John Luther Adams recording; the words originally <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> Inuit woman named Uvavnuk, an angakkuq (shaman) and oral poet.|$|E

5000|$|Of the ten {{types of}} women in the poem, nine are {{delineated}} as destructive: the dirty woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pig; the cunning woman originates <b>from</b> <b>a</b> fox, the incessantly curious and high-maintenance woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dog, the lazy or apathetic woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> earth or soil, the capricious woman of mood swings <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> seawater, the stubborn woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> ass, the untrustworthy and uncontrollable woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> ferret, the overly proud woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mare, and the worst and ugliest type of woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> ape or monkey. Only the [...] "Bee Woman" [...] is regarded as virtuous. The bee reference is considered homage to the earlier poem of Hesiod entitled Theogony, which uses the metaphor of women and men as bees in one part.|$|R

5|$|Although Hall's author's note disclaims any {{real-world}} {{basis for}} the ambulance unit that Stephen joins, she drew heavily on the wartime experiences of her friend Toupie Lowther, co-commander of the only women's unit {{to serve on the}} front in France. Lowther, like Stephen, <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> aristocratic family, adopted a masculine style of dress, and was an accomplished fencer, tennis player, motorist and jujitsu enthusiast. In later years she said the character of Stephen was based on her, which may have been partly true.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{identified as}} Mac Ragnaill (son of Ragnall) by the annals {{may have been}} Ragnall's son, though no name is given. In 942 Mac Ragnaill led a raid on Downpatrick, but within a week {{he was killed by}} Matudán, Overking of Ulster. The Annals of the Four Masters call Mac Ragnaill a jarl, but the Annals of Ulster call him a king. The Annals of the Four Masters also suggests he and his fellow plunderers <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> island.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{was born}} in Bexleyheath, Kent, (now part of the London Borough of Bexley) to English medical doctor Robert Bush (1920–2008) and Hannah Daly (1918–1992; from County Waterford, Ireland). She was raised as a Roman Catholic in their {{farmhouse}} in East Wickham, an urban village in the neighbouring town of Welling, with her older brothers, John and Paddy. Bush <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> artistic background: her mother was an amateur traditional Irish dancer, her father was an amateur pianist, Paddy worked as a musical instrument maker, and John was a poet and photographer. Both brothers {{were involved in the}} local folk music scene.|$|E
50|$|There are two genetic traits {{linked to}} feline {{cutaneous}} asthenia. One <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dominant allele, {{while the other}} <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> recessive. Both result similar pathology.|$|R
5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single normal distribution, but in fact <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mixture normals with different means. A second example is when the data is thought to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> exponential distribution, but actually <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting {{a closer look at}} the data is required.|$|R
50|$|Hirn <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{family of}} clerics. His father was Daniel Kristian Hirn (1807-1884), {{assistant}} pastor of Hauho. His mother was Gustava Sofia Ulrika Alopaeus († 1869).|$|R
5|$|Engelbart {{slipped into}} {{relative}} obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became alienated {{from him and}} left his organization for Xerox PARC, {{in part due to}} frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing. Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|He <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> {{upper-middle class}} English background, and studied at Winchester College and the University of Oxford. After graduating, he was {{employed}} {{as an assistant}} schoolmaster at a boarding school and pursued a parallel career in the law, qualifying as a barrister in 1885. His main interest outside work was cricket, which he played with many leading players of the time, including Lord Harris and Francis Lacey.|$|E
5|$|Marcinkus {{was born}} on 22 July 1907 in the provincial Lithuanian town of Jurbarkas. At the time Jurbarkas, as well {{of the rest of}} Lithuania, was part of the Russian Empire. Romualdas' father, Pranas Marcinkus, served as a {{policeman}} in Jurbarkas, Tauragė, and Rumšiškės. His mother, Honorata Kroazė-Marcinkienė, <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> urban family of French origins. Marcinkus' cousin, Vanda Kroazė-Šestakauskienė, stated that the Kroazė family's origins in Lithuania began with a Frenchman named Courvoisier, who came to Lithuania with Napoleon's army during the French invasion of Russia in the 19th century and married a local Lithuanian woman.|$|E

50|$|Anishinaabe {{has many}} {{different}} spellings. Different spelling systems may indicate vowel length or spell certain consonants differently (Anishinabe, Anicinape); meanwhile, variants ending in -eg/ek (Anishinaabeg, Anishinabek) <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> Algonquian plural, while those ending in <b>an</b> -e <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> Algonquian singular.|$|R

5|$|Marie Krøyer (1867–1940) <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> {{affluent}} German {{family who}} had moved to Copenhagen. From an early age she aspired to become an artist and after private training she went to study in Paris where Krøyer began to court her. It is believed Marie was subsequently reluctant to paint as she looked up to Krøyer as a far more accomplished artist. A few of her works have nevertheless survived.|$|E
5|$|Support {{for reform}} <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> {{unexpected}} source—a {{faction of the}} Tory Party—in 1829. The Tory government under Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, responding to the danger of civil strife in largely Roman Catholic Ireland, drew up the Catholic Relief Act 1829. This legislation repealed various laws that imposed political disabilities on Roman Catholics, in particular laws that prevented them from becoming members of Parliament. In response, disenchanted Tories who perceived {{a danger to the}} established religion came to favour parliamentary reform, in particular the enfranchisement of Manchester, Leeds, and other heavily Noncomformist cities in northern England.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountains}} {{are characteristic of}} the Great Basin's topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys. Oriented generally north to south, the Trout Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt, which <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> ancient volcano and other vents, on top of older metamorphic rocks. The {{southern end of the}} range, however, features many granitic outcrops. As a whole, the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by escarpments and canyons.|$|E

Kennedy.|$|R
5|$|The {{producers}} {{also thought}} it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. According to Cuse, the plot twist had become a Lost characteristic so they wanted to surprise the audience by having the Shannon-Boone relationship be sexual in nature. The idea for the two <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> observation that their bickering resembled an older married couple; to support this, they made the characters step-siblings as it had not yet been established what their sibling bond exactly was.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Echoes follows bounty hunter Samus Aran after she {{is sent to}} rescue Galactic Federation Marines from a ship near Aether, a planet {{inhabited}} by a race known as the Luminoth. There, she discovers that the troops were slaughtered by the Ing, a race that <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> alternate dimension of Aether. Samus must travel to three temples to ensure {{the destruction of the}} Ing, while battling Space Pirates and her mysterious doppelgänger called Dark Samus.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses near King at {{the moment}} of his death said that the shot came from another location. They said that it came from behind thick {{shrubbery}} near the boarding house—which had been cut away in the days following the assassination—and not from the boarding house window. However, Ray's fingerprints were found on various objects (a rifle, a pair of binoculars, articles of clothing, a newspaper) that were left in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire <b>came</b> <b>from.</b> <b>An</b> examination of the rifle containing Ray's fingerprints also determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm {{at the time of the}} assassination.|$|E

5|$|Amy starts {{becoming}} more afflicted {{by the image}} of the Angel in her eye, and the Doctor instructs her to keep her eyes closed, preventing her from seeing it. Octavian has the clerics guard Amy while he, the Doctor, and River make for a secondary control room {{on the other side of}} the oxygen factory. During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River to enter and secure the control room. They analyze the crack the Doctor saw and confirm that the leaking energy <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> explosion in time, and are able to narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E
5|$|Bohr's {{evidence}} <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> {{interpretation of}} a letter he received from a Soviet friend and scientist in Russia, which he showed to the British security services. He reasoned that the longer the United States and Britain hid their nuclear advancements, Russia would feel increasingly threatened and more inclined to speed up their effort to produce an atomic bomb of their own. With the help of U.S. Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, Bohr met with the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was initially sympathetic to his ideas about controlling nuclear weapons on 26 August 1944; but Churchill was adamantly opposed to informing the Soviet Union of such work. At the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944, Roosevelt sided with Churchill, deciding {{that it would be}} upon the nation's best interest to keep the atomic bomb project a secret. Moreover, they decided Bohr was potentially dangerous and specific security measures must be made in order to prevent him from leaking information {{to the rest of the}} world, Russia in particular.|$|E
5|$|De Hauteclocque <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> old line {{of country}} nobility. His direct {{ancestors}} {{had served in}} the Fifth Crusade against Egypt, and again in the Eighth Crusade of Saint Louis against Tunisia in 1270. They had also fought at the Battle of Saint-Omer in 1340 and the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745. The family managed to survive the French Revolution. Three members of the family served in Napoleon's Grande Armée and a fourth, who suffered from weak health, served in the supply train. The third son, Constantin, who had served in Napoleon's Russian Campaign, was created a chevalier by King Louis XVIII, and a Papal count by Pope Pius IX in 1857. Constantin had two sons. The older, Alfred Francois Marie (1822–1902), died childless. The younger, Gustave Francois Marie Joseph (1829–1914), became a noted Egyptologist.|$|E
