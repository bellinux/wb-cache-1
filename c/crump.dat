5|$|Initially, {{thinking}} that the FBI agent {{is part of a}} government conspiracy, <b>Crump</b> forces Mulder at gunpoint to drive, infuriating him along the way with antisemitic slurs. Eventually, Mulder and <b>Crump</b> make amends and attempt to work out a solution before it is too late. Mulder explains to <b>Crump</b> that Scully will meet them at the Pacific Coast, the end of the highway. There she will insert a needle into Crump's inner ear, hopefully relieving the pressure.

5|$|Mulder {{realizes that}} <b>Crump</b> is in a {{considerable}} amount of pain and {{that the only way to}} ease the pain is to drive west.

Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an increase in speed seems to be the only thing to help ease the pain of the increasing pressure.|$|E
