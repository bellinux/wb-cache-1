When proteins bind specifically to other copies of the same molecule, they can oligomerize to form fibrils; this process occurs often in structural proteins that consist of globular monomers that self-associate to form rigid fibers. Protein–protein interactions also regulate enzymatic activity, control progression through the cell cycle, and allow the assembly of large protein complexes that carry out many closely related reactions with a common biological function. Proteins can also bind to, or even be integrated into, cell membranes. The ability of binding partners to induce conformational changes in proteins allows the construction of enormously <b>complex</b> <b>signaling</b> networks.|$|E

2500|$|Biological {{signaling}} systems often rely on complexes {{of biological}} macromolecules that can undergo several functionally significant modifications that are mutually compatible. Thus, they can {{exist in a}} very large number of functionally different states. Modeling such multi-state systems poses two problems: The problem of how to describe and specify a multi-state system (the [...] "specification problem") and the problem of how to use a computer to simulate the progress of the system over time (the [...] "computation problem"). To address the specification problem, modelers have in recent years moved away from explicit specification of all possible states, and towards rule-based formalisms that allow for implicit model specification, including the -calculus, BioNetGen, the Allosteric Network Compiler and others. To tackle the computation problem, they have turned to particle-based methods that have in many cases proved more computationally efficient than population-based methods based on ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, or the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm. Given current computing technology, particle-based methods are sometimes the only possible option. Particle-based simulators further fall into two categories: Non-spatial simulators such as StochSim, DYNSTOC, RuleMonkey, and NFSim and spatial simulators, including Meredys, SRSim and MCell. Modelers can thus choose from a variety of tools; the best choice depending on the particular problem. Development of faster and more powerful methods is ongoing, promising the ability to simulate ever more <b>complex</b> <b>signaling</b> processes in the future.|$|E

40|$|<b>Complex</b> <b>signals</b> are the {{backbone}} of many modern applications, such as power systems, communication systems, biomedical sciences and military technologies. However, standard <b>complex</b> valued <b>signal</b> processing approaches are suited to only a subset of <b>complex</b> <b>signals</b> known as proper, and are inadequate of the generality of <b>complex</b> <b>signals,</b> as they do not fully exploit the available information. This is mainly due to the inherent blindness of the algorithms to the complete second order statistics of the signals, or due to under-modelling of the underlying system. The aim of this thesis is to provide enhanced complex valued, state space based, signal processing solutions for the generality of <b>complex</b> <b>signals</b> and systems. This is achieved based on the recent advances in the so called augmented complex statistics and widely linear modelling, which have brought to light the limitations of conventional statistical <b>complex</b> <b>signal</b> processing approaches. Exploiting these developments, we propose a class of widely linear adaptive state space estimation techniques, which provide a unified framework and enhanced performance for the generality of <b>complex</b> <b>signals,</b> compared with conventional approaches. These include the linear and nonlinear Kalman and particle filters, whereby it is shown that catering for the complete second order information and system models leads to significant performance gains. The proposed techniques are also extended {{to the case of}} cooperative distributed estimation, where nodes in a network collaborate locally to estimate signals, under a framework that caters for general <b>complex</b> <b>signals,</b> as well as the cross-correlations between observation noises, unlike earlier solutions. The analysis of the algorithms are supported by numerous case studies, including frequency estimation in three phase power systems, DIFAR sonobuoy underwater target tracking, and real-world wind modeling and prediction.

40|$|Abstract—The {{construction}} of Gabor’s complex signal—which {{is also known}} as the analytic signal—provides direct access to a real one–dimensional (1 -D) signal’s local amplitude and phase. The <b>complex</b> <b>signal</b> is built from a real signal by adding its Hilbert transform—which is a phase-shifted version of the signal—as an imaginary part to the signal. Since its introduction, the <b>complex</b> <b>signal</b> has become an important tool in signal processing, with applications, for example, in narrowband communication. Different approaches to an-D analytic or <b>complex</b> <b>signal</b> have been proposed in the past. We review these approaches and propose the hypercomplex signal as a novel extension of the <b>complex</b> <b>signal</b> to-D. This extension leads to a new definition of local phase, which reveals information on the intrinsic dimensionality of the signal. The different approaches are unified by expressing all of them as combinations of the signal and its partial and total Hilbert transforms. Examples that clarify how the approaches differ in their definitions of local phase and amplitude are shown. An example is provided for the two–dimensional (2 -D) hypercomplex signal, which shows how the novel phase concept can be used in texture segmentation.

Digital Storage Oscilloscopes (DSO) is used these days for acquisition and display of routine signals.

50|$|In this pathway, G-coupled protein receptors and {{tyrosine}} kinase receptors are activated, {{resulting in the}} activation of phospholipase C (PLC). PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2), resulting in a membrane associated product, diacylglycerol (DAG), and a water-soluble product, inositol triphosphate (IP3). DAG acts as a second messenger, activating several protein kinases and produces extended downstream signaling. IP3 is also a second messenger which activates receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ion stores into the cytoplasm, creating a <b>complex</b> <b>signaling</b> system that can be involved in modulating fertilization, proliferation, contraction, cell metabolism, vesicle and fluid secretion, and information processing in neuronal cells. Overall, DAG and IP3 signaling has implications for neuronal plasticity, impacting hippocampal long term potentiation, stress-induced cognitive impairment, and neuronal growth cone spreading. Furthermore, not only is PIP2 a precursor to several signaling molecules, it can be phosphorylated at the 3’ position to become PIP3, which is involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell movement.|$|E
