60|$|This Inflection may be {{mechanically}} explained, {{either by}} Monsieur Des Cartes principles by conceiving the Globuls {{of the third}} Element to find less and less resistance against that side of them which is downwards, or by a way, which I have further explicated in the Inquisition about Colours, to be from an obliquation of the pulse of light, whence the under part is continually promoted, and consequently refracted towards the perpendicular, which cuts the Orbs at right angles. What the particular Figure of the <b>Curve</b> <b>line,</b> describ'd by this way of light, is, I shall not now stand to examine, especially since there may be so many sorts of it as there may be varieties of the Positions of the intermediat degrees of density and rarity between the bottom {{and the top of}} the inflecting Medium.|$|E
60|$|I am {{now using}} the term beauty in its most {{comprehensive}} sense, as including expression and artistic interest,--that is, I consider not only the living balance, but likewise all the accompaniments that even by disturbing are necessary to the renewal and continuance of the balance. And in this sense I proceed to show, that the beautiful in the object may be referred to two elements,--lines and colours; the first belonging to the shapely ('forma, formalis, formosus'), and in this, to the law, and the reason; and the second, to the lively, the free, the spontaneous, and the self-justifying. As to lines, the rectilineal are in themselves the lifeless, the determined 'ab extra', but still in immediate union with the cycloidal, which are expressive of function. The <b>curve</b> <b>line</b> is a modification of the force from without by the force from within, or the spontaneous. These are not arbitrary symbols, but the language of nature, universal and intuitive, {{by virtue of the}} law by which man is impelled to explain visible motions by imaginary causative powers analogous to his own acts, as the Dryads, Hamadryads, Naiads, &c.|$|E

60|$|This {{inflection}} (if I may so call it) I imagine to {{be nothing}} else, but a multiplicate refraction, caused by the unequal density of the constituent parts of the medium, whereby the motion, action or progress of the Ray of light is hindred from proceeding in a streight line, and inflected or deflected by a curve. Now, {{that it is a}} <b>curve</b> <b>line</b> is manifest by this Experiment: I took a Box, such as ADGE, in the first Figure of the 37. Scheme, whose sides ABCD, and EFGH, were made of two smooth flat plates of Glass, then filling it half full with a very strong solution of Salt, I filled the other half with very fair fresh water, then exposing the opacous side, DHGC, to the Sun, I observ'd both the refraction and inflection of the Sun beams, ID & KH, and marking as exactly as I could, the points, P, N, O, M, by which the Ray, KH, passed through the compounded medium, I found them to be in a curve line; for the parts of the medium being continually more dense the neerer they were to the bottom, the Ray pf was continually more and more deflected downwards from the streight line.|$|E

5000|$|Newton's {{cannonball}} was {{a thought}} experiment used {{to bridge the}} gap between Galileo's gravitational acceleration and Kepler's elliptical orbits. It appeared in Newton's 1728 book A Treatise of the System of the World. According to Galileo's concept of gravitation, a dropped stone falls with constant acceleration down towards the Earth. However, Newton explains that when a stone is thrown horizontally (meaning sideways or perpendicular to Earth's gravity) it follows a curved path. [...] "For a stone projected is by the pressure of its own weight forced out of the rectilinear path, which by the projection alone it should have pursued, and made to describe a <b>curve</b> <b>line</b> in the air; and through that crooked way is at last brought down to the ground. And the greater the velocity is with which it is projected, the farther it goes before it falls to the Earth." [...] Newton further reasons that if an object were [...] "projected in an horizontal direction from the top of a high mountain" [...] with sufficient velocity, [...] "it would reach at last quite beyond the circumference of the Earth, and return to the mountain from which it was projected." ...|$|E

5000|$|There are {{different}} triangular patterned board designs {{attached to the}} Alquerque board, and therefore Komikan has several variants. The standard triangular board (with one horizontal line across {{the breadth of the}} triangle, and one vertical line {{along the length of the}} triangle) described by Stewart Culin in 1898 (as Solitario) is only one of them. In 1918-19, Matus Z. described a Komikan board with a triangular board with two horizontal lines across its breadth, a single vertical line along its length, and two shorter vertical lines where the shorter horizontal line (the one closest to the Alquerque board) intersects with the triangles two sides. Another board described in 1980 by J. Alcina Franch described a Taptana board with a heart-shaped triangular board with a <b>curve</b> <b>line</b> connecting to a little circle that touches the Alquerque board. This board was found at Chinchero, Peru near the capitol, Cuzco, scratched on a Pre-Hispanic wall. This board has been used as an argument that Komikan or Taptana is a Pre-Hispanic or Pre-Columbian indigenous game of South America. The last Inca emperor Atahualpa is shown on an illustration to play taptana in the Cajamarca jail with his Spanish guard (from Waman Puma de Ayala in his book written in 1615 pgs. 388, 390) before his death in 1533. The Taptana board, however, is missing a triangular board attached to it, and therefore, it looks to be a standard Alquerque board. Whether or not Komikan or Taptana is indigenous to South America, all other sources so far are after Columbus discovery of the Americas.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{reliability}} of parameters obtained from a novel postural sway task test based on body movements controlled by visual feedback. Fifty-nine volunteers were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of young (n = 32, 16 females and 16 males, age: 25. 2 ± 3. 4 years) and the second group of elderly individuals (n = 27, 17 females and 10 males, age: 75. 7 ± 6. 9 years). Participants stood in parallel on a computer based stabilographic platform with the feet approximately a shoulder width apart, the toes slightly pointing outwards, the hands placed on the hips. The computer screen was placed approximately 1. 5 meter from the platform at a height of subjects’ eyes. An instantaneous visual feedback of participant’s centre of pressure (COP) was given in a form of a blue cross visible on the screen. Participants were instructed to keep the blue cross driven by movements of their hips as close as possible to a predefined curve flowing on the screen. Out of the 6 parameters studied, only the average distance of COP from the <b>curve</b> <b>line</b> and the sum of the COP crossings through the <b>curve</b> <b>line</b> showed high reliability. Correlation between these two highly reliable parameters was - 0. 89. There was also a statistical difference (p< 0. 001) between young and elderly in both the average distance of COP from the <b>curve</b> <b>line</b> and the sum of the COP crossings through the curve. To conclude, the novel postural sway task provides a simple tool with relatively low time burden needed for testing. The suggested output parameters measured are highly reliable and easy to interpret...|$|E
