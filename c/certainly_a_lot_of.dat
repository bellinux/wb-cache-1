Now, most of them believed that the migration happened when the Persian Empire was defeated and the Persians became Muslims. So presumably this happened almost 1400 years ago, during Muhammad's times or even during the Khalifa’s rule after the his death.This raises serious issues, if they lived in Iran during that time, there were no Sunnis or Shiites, there were only Muslims. When Persia turned Shiite commencing from 1501, the Huwala were there, so why did they not turn Shiite as well? Are we saying that only the Arabs stayed Sunni? Or maybe just maybe there were Persians who didn't turn Shiite, who then became Huwala. This {{puts a lot of}} holes in the theory that they migrated {{in the early days of}} Islam to teach the Persians about Islam. <b>Certainly</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Arabs went to Persia to teach them about Islam, but it is unsure if these were the Huwala.The second point is, if they were going there for business, why did they get disconnected with their so-called Arab roots?

Not even names?Lets for a second believe that they are from Arab origins, the question is doesn’t 1400 years (or even 500 years) of mixing with Persian blood, effectively take away the Arab bloodline ? ...|$|E

I think this film doesn’t build Bruce to be a god. There’s an undercurrent that he’s a very decent man, and that does come across in the stories that are told. It’s just very heartfelt stories of people talking about how Bruce and his music has affected their lives. One guy from Israel says, ‘Bruce taught me how to be a man — a decent man.’ That’s who Bruce is. I really tried not to make it heavy-handed. I didn’t come to the film as a Bruce Springsteen fan. I’m leaving it as a great admirer. I think his career is astonishing. I think the fact that he’s still producing relevant music — the fact that 2012 he released Wrecking Ball at the age of 60, that’s an amazing achievement."

40|$|Just as {{managed care}} has changed {{utilization}} and incentives {{in other parts}} of health care, there is a whole set of incentives built around long-term care that really matter. For example, if nursing homes have a financial incentive to hospitalize people with certain health conditions, then in the long run {{they are not going to}} develop the programs and invest in the resources to treat those people in the facility. Instead they're going to use those resources to stay in business or to provide other types of care. And while we can assume that policymakers do not create regulations that they expect will lead to poor quality, efforts to increase access or efficiency sometimes have the unintended consequence of reducing quality. Health care sectors in which spending is rising particularly rapidly or in which access seems to be problematic may be prone to regulations that fail to take into account potential effects on quality. There's a lot of money spent on nursing homes; there's <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> interest from public funders in nursing homes; and nursing homes have a long history of quality-of-care problems.

40|$|Rose Slivka {{tells us}} in her essay, The Persistent Object, that the {{craftsman}} {{is a man}} of eminence, making objects to emanate power and magic (from its original Saxon form kraft, meaning power and strength) and invested all tools of utility with this presence. All objects were symbols of power no less than utility. As an act of making, craft embodies a regenerative reality. Craft was more than it is, an integral ingredient of the human condition. It carries a reminder of being human. The act of making, of interacting with tools and materials is {{what it feels like to}} be human. Anything less is merely an illusion or a cerebral misunderstanding. The physical engagement in a creative process is a human phenomenon and by virtue of our relation to this biosphere we all deserve the privilege of being included in the event. Craft is fundamentally encoded in our DNA. If the gene for active creativity has somehow been repressed or misplaced, these words are a reminder that acknowledging the fact will more than likely suspend any atrophy. The craftsman knows how to access, invest and reveal the power mentioned by Rose Slivka, but in the context of today amongst the congestion of excess, variety, and the perpetual discount, the crafted artifact is rarely sought nor its power recognized.

Forrester Research estimates that in 1999 business-to-consumer (B 2 C) eCommerce will reach $ 20 billion and business-to-business (B 2 B) eCommerce will reach $ 109 billion. However, as interaction designers and HCI researchers, we all know that usability can have a sharp impact on the user experience, which can directly affect a business ' bottom line. A recent report released by Creative Good [1] estimates that $ 6 billion was lost due to poor web experiences in 1999. A clear example of the importance of usability was when IBM experienced a 400 % increase in sales after redesigning their web site with usability in mind [2].

40|$|Before {{talking about}} private sector {{involvement}} in specific recent education initiatives, I {{want us to}} think a bit about how {{what we are talking}} about here today relates to wider aspects of privatisation. I wrote my first paper on the 'privatisation of education ' back in 1984 for an American journal, Educational Leadership. What was arguably important about that paper, and another one I wrote with a colleague a few years later, was that it tried to distinguish between different meanings of the term ‘privatisation ’ and I think that remains important today, especially if we are posing the question of this conference: ‘Involving the Private Sector in Education: Value Added or High Risk? ’ Because I shall want to argue that things which may seem to add value in the short-term may also pose a risk in the longer term. So what might we mean by privatisation? Although the term is frequently used, it is often only loosely defined. David Donnison has argued that ‘its meaning is at best uncertain and often tendentious ’ and he goes so far as to claim that it is designed ‘not to clarify analysis but as a symbol [...] . to dramatise a conflict and mobilise support ’- one way or the other. There is <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sensitivity about terminology. For example, I recently served on the Islington education commission and, while some people liked to refer to what has happened there as privatisation, others insisted that contracting out of services was not the same thing at all. So let’s explore this a bit more. At its simplest level, the organisation of welfare services, including education, can be represented in terms of the relationship between sources of funding and provision (Figure 1). Rudolf Klein suggests that ‘the “pure ” model of comprehensive state welfare ’ is located in Cell 1. And has applied to most (though not all) mass education systems, where both funding and provision have traditionally been located firmly in the public sector...|$|E
