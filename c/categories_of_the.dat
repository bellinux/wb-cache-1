5|$|IQ classifications for {{individuals}} also vary because category labels for IQ score ranges {{are specific to}} each brand of test. The test publishers {{do not have a}} uniform practice of labeling IQ score ranges, nor do they have a consistent practice of dividing up IQ score ranges into <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same size or with the same boundary scores. Thus psychologists should specify which test was given when reporting a test-taker's IQ. Psychologists and IQ test authors recommend that psychologists adopt the terminology of each test publisher when reporting IQ score ranges.|$|E

5|$|Syndromes {{in which}} causes are not clearly {{identified}} {{are difficult to}} match with <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current classification of epilepsy. Categorization for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily. The idiopathic (unknown cause) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and/or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes {{are included in the}} unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic, for instance benign rolandic epilepsy. Others are included in symptomatic despite a presumed genetic cause (in at least in some cases), for instance Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature (e.g. Angelman syndrome) were categorized symptomatic but it was argued to include these within the category idiopathic. Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research.|$|E

5|$|Five Egyptian boxers {{qualified}} for the Olympics, {{all of whom were}} men and earned their spots at the 2012 African Boxing Olympic Qualification Tournament. The only Egyptian to win a bout in London was Hesham Yehia, in the flyweight division, who defeated Benson Gicharu of Kenya before losing to Jasurbek Latipov of Uzbekistan in the round of 16. Yehia's most successful major international tournament had been the 2011 Pan Arab Games, where he had been the flyweight runner-up. The most experienced boxer was Mohamed Hikal, who had competed in the light-middleweight, welterweight, and middleweight <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2000, 2004, and 2008 Summer Olympics respectively. Among his international boxing distinctions, he was 1999 and 2003 All-African champion, 2005 Mediterranean champion, 2007 and 2011 Pan Arab champion, and 2007 African champion, and won a bronze medal at the 2005 World Championships. In 2012 he was once again representing Egypt as a middleweight and lost his first bout to Soltan Migitinov of Azerbaijan. Ramy Helmy El-Awadi, a bronze medalist from the 2007 Pan Arab Games, received a bye in the opening round of the light flyweight class and was defeated by Ferhat Pehlivan of Turkey in the round of 16. Mohamed Ramadan and Eslam El-Gendy lost their first bouts to eventual silver medalist Han Soon-Chul of South Korea and Gyula Káté of Hungary in the lightweight and light welterweight events respectively.|$|E
5|$|The literary, {{as well as}} the historical, {{value of}} the Historia Augusta has {{suffered}} greatly {{as a result of the}} method of its composition. In the arrangement in <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.|$|E
