40|$|<b>Demand</b> <b>control</b> is {{the concept}} of {{regulating}} the peak electrical demand of a commercial, industrial or residential power system so as to minimize the peak demand charges that must be paid by the customer to the electric utility providing the power. This peak demand is usually defined as the maximum average demand over a 15, 30 or 60 minute interval during the billing period. The attention given to <b>demand</b> <b>control</b> has been rapidly increasing due to increasing electricity rates and the application of microprocessor technology to this concept. In regulating his peak demand,- the customer desires to accomplish the same amount of work as before. Some <b>demand</b> <b>control</b> has been achieved through the optimum scheduling of electrical use while additional savings can be achieved through conservation practices (conservation practice also reduce the total energy consumed). The practice of <b>demand</b> <b>control</b> by commercial and industrial customers of electric utilities is experiencing increasing popularity.

40|$|The energy {{issue is}} rising on the agendas {{all over the}} world and energy {{efficiency}} and energy saving become more and more important. The building sector stands for a large part of the total energy used, e. g. for space heating and cooling, heating of domestic hot water and household electricity and there is a recent European directive related to the energy performance of buildings. The influence of occupant behaviour on the use of energy in the residential building sector has furthermore got increased attention in recent years. The overall aim of the work is to contribute to the knowledge about possible energy savings in existing Swedish apartment buildings. The more specific aim is to analyse the influence of <b>demand</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation and room temperature on the heat requirements in a typical Swedish apartment building. The aim related to <b>demand</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation is to analyse the performance of a system for Swedish apartment buildings developed as a part of the research work. The aim related to <b>demand</b> <b>controlled</b> room temperature is to analyse a novel system developed as an individual heat (or comfort) metering system. The analysis also includes a more general evaluation of individual metering. The work is strongly related to a comprehensive renovation project recently carried out by the municipal housing company Bostads AB Gårdsten.

40|$|This {{document}} summarizes {{a research}} effort on <b>demand</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation and classroom ventilation. The research on <b>demand</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation included field studies and building energy modeling. Major findings included: ?	The single-location carbon dioxide sensors widely used for <b>demand</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation frequently have large errors and {{will fail to}} effectively control ventilation rates (VRs). ?	Multi-location carbon dioxide measurement systems with more expensive sensors connected to multi-location sampling systems may measure carbon dioxide more accurately. ?	Currently-available optical people counting systems work well {{much of the time}} but have large counting errors in some situations. ?	In meeting rooms, measurements of carbon dioxide at return-air grilles appear to be a better choice than wall-mounted sensors. ?	In California, <b>demand</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation in general office spaces is projected to save significant energy and be cost effective only if typical VRs without <b>demand</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation are very high relative to VRs in codes. Based on the research, several recommendations were developed for <b>demand</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation specifications in the California Title 24 Building Energy Efficiency Standards. The research on classroom ventilation collected data over two years on California elementary school classrooms to investigate associations between VRs and student illness absence (IA). Major findings included: ?	Median classroom VRs in all studied climate zones were below the California guideline, and 40 percent lower in portable than permanent buildings. ?	Overall, one additional L/s per person of VR was associated with 1. 6 percent less IA. ?	Increasing average VRs in California K- 12 classrooms from the current average to the required level is estimated to decrease IA by 3. 4 percent, increasing State attendance-based funding to school districts by $ 33 M, with $ 6. 2 M in increased energy costs. Further VR increases would provide additional benefits. ?	Confirming these findings in intervention studies is recommended. ?	Energy costs of heating/cooling unoccupied classrooms statewide are modest, but a large portion occurs in relatively few classrooms...|$|R

40|$|Although it {{has been}} used for many years in {{commercial}} buildings, the application of <b>demand</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation in residences is limited. In this study we used occupant exposure to pollutants integrated over time (referred to as 'dose') as the metric to evaluate the effectiveness and air quality implications of <b>demand</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation in residences. We looked at air quality for two situations. The first is that typically used in ventilation standards: the exposure over a long term. The second is to look at peak exposures that are associated with time variations in ventilation rates and pollutant generation. The pollutant generation had two components: a background rate associated with the building materials and furnishings and a second component related to occupants. The <b>demand</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation system operated at a low airflow rate when the residence was unoccupied and at a high airflow rate when occupied. We used analytical solutions to the continuity equation to determine the ventilation effectiveness and the long-term chronic dose and peak acute exposure for a representative range of occupancy periods, pollutant generation rates and airflow rates. The results of the study showed that we can optimize the <b>demand</b> <b>controlled</b> airflow rates to reduce the quantity of air used for ventilation without introducing problematic acute conditions...|$|R

Bachelor thesis in Public Health Science. Department of Occupational and Public Health Science. Faculty of Health and Occupational Studies. University of Gävle, Sweden. Background: In Sweden, employees who work within health and social care is the largest occupational group and is also the group which accounts for the highest number of illness cases. Work in health care often means a variety of psychosocial workloads such as high <b>demands,</b> low <b>control</b> and lack of social support. Aim: The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the experiences and/or presence of <b>demands,</b> <b>control</b> and social support among nurses and home care workers in their daily work in health care in a municipality in central Sweden. Method: The study included 44 participants, 12 nurses and 32 home care workers. In a quantitative cross-sectional study, data was collected by use of a questionnaire designed by the author for the aim of the study. Participants reported their age, gender, working years and working hours, and answered questions about the experience and/or presence of <b>demands,</b> <b>control</b> and social support in their daily work. Results: The majority of the respondents experienced social support at their workplace. However, respondents 44 years or younger, did rarely/did not experience high work demands from managers or colleagues. Employees who worked more irregular hours experienced more often that they achieved expectations of what should be done from the care takers and their relatives. Respondents who had worked as caregivers 10 years or more, felt that their working hours were governed by the needs of care taker. Conclusion: The results show that an inadequate psychosocial work environment, with high <b>demands,</b> low <b>control</b> and lack of social support, was not experienced and/or a present problem among the majority of the respondents. Further research and knowledge is needed on how the perception of <b>demands,</b> <b>control</b> and social support at work has an impact on the self-perceived health of municipal employees within the health care sector since the work leave due to illness in this sector in Sweden continues to rise.

40|$|Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) is {{a public}} {{transportation}} mode, in which small automated vehicles transport passengers on <b>demand.</b> <b>Central</b> <b>control</b> of the vehicles leads to interesting possibilities for optimized routings. The complexity of the involved routing problems together {{with the fact that}} routing algorithms for PRT essentially have to run in real-time often leads to the choice of fast greedy approaches. The most common routing approach is arguably a sequential one, where upcoming requests are greedily served in a quickest way without interfering with previously routed vehicles. The simplicity of this approach {{stems from the fact that}} a chosen route is never changed later. This is as well the main drawback of it, potentially leading to large detours. It is natural to ask how much one could gain by using a more adaptive routing strategy. This question is the main motivation of this article. In this paper, we first suggest a simple mathematical model for PRT, and then introduce a new adaptive routing algorithm that repeatedly uses solutions to an LP as a guide to route vehicles. Our routing approach incorporates new requests in the LP as soon as they appear, and reoptimizes the routing of all currently used vehicles, contrary to sequential routing. We provide preliminary computational results that give first evidence of the potential gains of an adaptive routing strategy, as used in our algorithm. National Science Foundation (U. S.)

40|$|Purpose The main aim of {{this study}} was to assess changes in {{perceived}} <b>demand,</b> <b>control</b> and support at work of neck and back pain patients over 1 year. We also hypothesised that perceived changes in <b>demand,</b> <b>control</b> and support at work were associated with clinical improvement, reduced fear-avoidance beliefs and successful return to work. Methods Four hundred and five sick-listed patients referred to secondary care with neck or back pain were originally included in an interventional study. Of these, two hundred and twenty-six patients reported perceived psychosocial work factors at both baseline and 1 -year follow-up, and they were later included in this prospective study. Changes in <b>demand,</b> <b>control</b> and support dimensions were measured by a total of nine variables. Results At the group level, no significant differences were found among the measured subscales. At the individual level, the regression analyses showed that decreases in fear-avoidance beliefs about work were consistently related to decreases in demand and increases in control, whereas decreases in disability, anxiety and depression were related to increases in support subscales. Conclusions The perception of <b>demand,</b> <b>control</b> and support appear to be stable over 1 year in patients with neck and back pain, despite marked improvement in pain and disability. Disability, anxiety, depression and fear-avoidance beliefs about work were significantly associated with the perception of the work environment, whereas neck and back pain were not.

40|$|A {{dual-mode}} <b>demand</b> <b>control</b> ventilation {{strategy was}} developed targeting at using in institutional or similar buildings where {{the number of}} occupants varies frequently. One occupant-related and one non-occupant-related indoor contaminants were used as the indication signals to control the fresh air intake. The first contaminant is carbon dioxide, {{which is a good}} surrogate gas for bio-effluent and the second is radon which is non-occupant-related and had been identified as a major indoor air pollutant in some buildings in the university where this project has been carried out. A modulation mode was designed to modulate the fresh air intake to maintain an acceptable indoor air quality during occupied hours. Two purging sequences were designed to reduce the radon accumulation during the non-occupied period, which is the most common reason that the occupants are exposed to an undesired radon level. In order to verify the performance of this dual-mode <b>demand</b> <b>control</b> ventilation strategy, a <b>demand</b> <b>control</b> system was developed and was used in a lecture theatre at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where radon level was found to be very high in our former experiments.
