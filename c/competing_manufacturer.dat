2500|$|During World War I, Colt surpassed all {{previous}} production achievements. John Browning worked for Colt for a time, {{and came up}} with a design for a semiautomatic pistol, which debuted as the Colt M1900 pistol and eventually evolved into the M1911. Prior to America's entry into the war, orders from Canada and the United Kingdom swelled the backlog of orders to three years. Colt hired 4,000 more workers, making a total of 10,000 employees—and its stock's price increased by 400%. By 1918, Colt had produced and sold 425,500 of the famous Browning-designed M1911. Because the factory could not keep up with demand for this pistol, the US Military decided to accept Colt New Service revolvers in caliber [...]45 ACP, called the M1917 revolver, as a substitute weapon. <b>Competing</b> <b>manufacturer</b> Smith & Wesson made double-action revolvers in [...]45 ACP, which were accepted and issued by the U.S. military under the same name. Colt produced 151,700 revolvers during the war as well as 13,000 Maxim-Vickers machine guns and 10,000 Browning machine guns with an additional 100,000 under subcontract to other companies.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary draft. Please, do not quote) We {{investigate}} an oligopoly {{to determine}} the strategic effects of manufacturers ’ returns policies on market competition. Each <b>competing</b> <b>manufacturer</b> produces and distributes a product through retailers in competition. The demand function is subject to random shocks. Manufacturers observe these shocks only after choosing simultaneously wholesale prices and returns policies. For each manufacturer, we derive the optimal wholesale and buy-back prices. In a comparative static analysis, we determine how prices (wholesale, retail, and buy-back), inventories, and welfare change with respect to returns policies. We show that returns policies decrease manufacturers profitability by increasing price competition...|$|E
40|$|Most {{end-product}} {{manufacturers have}} ingredients supplied by other firms. Given {{a choice between}} two suppliers, one supplying a branded high-quality ingredient and the other supplying a generic, which supplier should a manufacturer choose? How does {{the presence of a}} <b>competing</b> <b>manufacturer</b> affect this choice? If two vertically differentiated manufacturers – manufacturers with different levels of assembly quality – are making this choice simultaneously, who would benefit more from adopting the branded ingredient, and who is more likely to adopt the generic one? In this paper we address these issues with a game theoretic model where competing manufacturers negotiate simultaneously with the supplier of a branded ingredient over the supply contracts. We show that in equilibrium both manufacturers adopt the branded ingredient when its supplier enjoys low production cost and/or superior quality compared to its generic counterpart. However, when the cost of the branded ingredient is high, equilibrium results depend on how consumers form quality perceptions about the end products. We examine three quality perception functions: substitute, complement, and salience. Under substitute perception, competing manufacturers with different levels of assembly quality either both or neither adopt the branded ingredient. Under complement (salience) perception, the manufacturer with higher (lower) assembly quality can be the only one adopting the branded ingredient...|$|E
40|$|This article investigates shelf space {{allocation}} in {{the marketing}} of manufacturer brands (national brands) and retailer house brands (store brands) in the consumer packaged goods sector in a highly concentrated grocery retail environment. Of special interest {{is the degree to}} which the market mechanism is still at play in this kind of environment where retail chains wield considerable power over manufacturers supplying the respective grocery retail categories. The study focuses on two consumer packaged goods categories, and data collection is conducted via a combination of in-store category observation and in-depth interviews. The results of in-store category observation data indicate that the shelf space occupied by retailer house brands is largely proportional to the market share of the retailer house brands, which tends to negate the possibility of abuse of power within the product categories studied. Analysis of research interview data unveiled a number of themes that seem to collectively indicate that, both the manufacturer brand and the retailer house brand will continue to have a home in the respective categories, and performance on the part of manufacturer brands is expected for them to be able to justify occupation of valuable shelf space ahead of other <b>competing</b> <b>manufacturer</b> brands in the tightly contested shelf arena. The study points to the importance of participation of both manufacturer and retailer house brands if optimum category performance is to be achieved. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} for a {{retailer}} to sell products from <b>competing</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> How then should the firms manage their contract negotiations? Different from market structures researched before, contracts serve {{as a tool for}} competition tools rather than coordinating the whole supply chain In our paper, We study our models between <b>competing</b> <b>manufacturers</b> who sell symmetric products, and a common retailer facing stochastic demand. We allow the <b>manufacturers</b> to <b>compete</b> for the retailer&# 39;s business using one of two types of contracts, a wholesale-price contract, a buyback contract. We find that some key conclusions of our settings are Inconsistent in other market structures discussed before. We show that in our market structure the buyback contract forces the <b>manufacturers</b> to <b>compete</b> more aggressively than when they only offer wholesale-price contracts, and this may leave them worse off and the retailer substantially better off.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} how firms design supply contract and share information for supply chains under horizontal competition and asymmetric information. The problem is studied using a model of two supply chains, each consists of one manufacturer and one retailer. Each retailer will observe a private demand signal about the market and decide whether to share it with the manufacturer of his own chain. A multi-stage game is formulated to analyze how different firms make information sharing, contracting and retail quantity (or price) decisions. For a perfect demand signal model with Cournot competition, we show that the incentives of information sharing are positive under quantity-based contract menus but become negative under linear price contracts. We also show that a lower investment cost for information sharing (or a higher information sharing capability) is a competitive advantage, which is more significant when the competing supply chain that has a higher investment cost is induced not to invest in information sharing and is made less aggressive due to the use of contract menus. For an imperfect demand signal model with revenue sharing contracts, we show that the incentives for information sharing are always negative under Cournot competition but can be positive or negative under Bertrand competition. For the latter case, it is more likely for a supply chain to have positive incentives for information sharing when the signal precision (or forecasting capability) of either supply chain is higher, the products are more similar, the manufacturer can get more revenue allocation or the <b>competing</b> <b>manufacturer</b> gets less revenue allocation...|$|E
40|$|An {{increase}} in competition and broader product lines {{has resulted in}} cannibalization of product categories. This waste of marketing resources concerns both manufacturers and retailers and has drawn the attention of marketers {{to the need for}} effective category management. One strategy to consolidate categories is product elimination. The questions that concern managers are where will the customers of the eliminated brand go and will the customers be captured by the same manufacturer? This dissertation seeks to provide an answer to this question by developing a metric and modeling approach to measure the level of reverse cannibalization and evaluate changes in competitive position as a result of brand exit. This dissertation develops a hybrid reverse cannibalization model that utilizes both customer background information and transactional data to measure changes in competitive position upon the exit of a brand. ^ A brand draw metric was developed as the ratio of the number of customers drawn by a brand from another brand 2 ̆ 7 s core group {{to the size of the}} competitor 2 ̆ 7 s core group. Bootstrapping experiments with 6, 8, and 10 brands were conducted to test the robustness of the brand draw metric. ^ A Multinomial Logit model was specified to examine the plausibility of the proportional draw market share model assumption. The violation of the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives assumption provided support for the finding of asymmetries in brand draws. ^ The MNL and hybrid models suggest that some brands compete more strongly with sister brands than with <b>competing</b> <b>manufacturer</b> brands. Strategic implications of the model findings are discussed for each simulated brand exit. ^ The dissertation provides substantive contributions through an enriched understanding of category structures and brand draw effects. The reverse cannibalization model to predict brand choice in the event of a brand exit and the robust brand draw metric that captures asymmetric competitive effects are methodological contributions. The model makes a valuable contribution to marketing practice because it allows marketers to evaluate the potential for strategic changes to product lines through simulated exits. ...|$|E
