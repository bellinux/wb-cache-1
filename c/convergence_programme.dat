We first present basic stylized facts about public budgets of those countries. The paper then analyses reasons which led to periods of fiscal consolidations in NMS. Secondly, we also present evidence from Pre-Accession Economic and <b>Convergence</b> <b>programmes</b> of NMSs concerning planed steps of fiscal authorities and try to contrast them with reality. Throughout the paper, we identify two different groups of countries which significantly differ in their fiscal behaviour. On the one side is group of Baltic countries displaying strong reform effort and responsible fiscal policy usually supported by strong economic growth. On the second extreme, we identify fiscally irresponsible central European countries and two Mediterranean islands displaying lax fiscal policies and little political will to implement costly reforms. Somewhere between stand Slovenia and Slovakia, first without strong reform performance yet with budget deficit in compliance with Stability and Growth Pact and later for its recent reform efforts. Our key finding concerning behaviour of fiscally irresponsible group of countries is that their current problems with high budget deficits originate in their lax approach and inability to implement politically costly expenditure cuts which is apparent from their revision of budget plans and endeavour to shift envisioned deficit reduction into the future. Yet, this strategy has led those countries to uncomfortable position vis-a-vis European fiscal rules. fiscal policy; new member states; consolidations; Stability and Growth Pact; Excessive Deficit Procedure; <b>Convergence</b> <b>Programmes</b> banking...|$|R

40|$|The present EU {{budget is}} {{inconsistent}} with the current state and future prospects of European integration. Three failures are most evident: first, spending is heavily tilted towards {{the support of a}} declining sector, agriculture; second, {{it is almost impossible to}} reallocate spending across time and across policies; and third, its size is unrelated with the goals of the Union. Transforming the Community budget into a means through which the economic policy of the Union is consistently defined and put into practice requires correcting these failures.

40|$|Eurozone {{convergence}} {{provides a}} unique opportunity for accession countries to abandon macroeconomic stabilisation policies that suffer from weak credibility. On the other hand, expectations of future improvements in macroeconomic variables and trend appreciation of the currency may undermine the relationship between interest rates, exchange rates and economic fundamentals, making the economy vulnerable to sudden changes in market sentiments regarding the timing and path to Eurozone accession. Recent developments in Hungary illustrate the impact of changing expectations on exchange rate and interest rate volatility. Two lessons {{can be drawn from}} the Hungarian experience. First, benign market sentiment and easier access to finance does not imply less pressure to correct macroeconomic imbalances in the long run. Second, convergence strategies should be robust with respect to sudden shifts in capital flows.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{the determinants of}} macroeconomic forecasts (budget balance, public debt and real GDP growth), of {{the governments of the}} 15 EU countries. We have used the forecasts of the Stability and <b>Convergence</b> <b>Programmes</b> submitted between 1998 / 99 and 2008 / 09 and the European Commission’s.

The lack of accuracy of government forecasts is due to “misinformation” regarding the economic situation {{at the time of their}} publication. The differences between observed and forecast changes of budget balance and public debt are explained by the output growth forecast errors and the forecasts of the changes in the two fiscal indicators. These forecast changes tend to revise downwards the changes submitted in the previous Program. Therefore, the governments’ “bad intention” seems to result from their lack of commitment to the objectives of previous programs and it explains the recurrent delays in the implementation of their fiscal consolidation plans...|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{convergence}} {{has gained a}} lot of interest in the past few years in both theory and practice. On one hand, observers see convergence as a meaningless technology fad. Other observers, on the other hand consider convergence to be an important factor for the design of new mobile information infrastructures and services. This paper investigates these contradictory discourses by applying Luhmann’s Systems Theory to analyse the use of the notion of convergence in business press databases and professional social network profiles in UK mobile telecommunications. The data corpus contains 3, 008 press articles from 1979 - 2008 on mobile convergence collected from Reuters Factiva database and 1, 007 profiles from UK telecommunications professionals from LinkedIn. The analysis of 30 years of convergence articles shows that convergence cannot be regarded as a simple management fad. Convergence in the context of mobility is well established in the UK since 1987 and is part of the self-perception of many practitioners. However, the findings suggest that convergence does have characteristics of a fashion. These characteristics that make it appear to be a fashion are based on its systemic function of reducing differences. <b>Convergence</b> <b>programmes</b> aim to reduce differences and are therefore important steering mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Which are the {{institutional}} and constitutional settings that best reduce {{the tendency to}} manipulate fiscal forecasts? This paper addresses the question by examining the quality of fiscal forecasts {{at different stages of}} the budget process in 13 European Union countries by using annual forecast vintages (1999 – 2013) from Stability and <b>Convergence</b> <b>Programmes.</b> Both the role of political structures and the balance of power between the executive and the legislature are assessed as determinants of systematic forecasting errors. The findings suggest that the forecasting bias is more effectively countered in presidential and semi/presidential systems, in parliamentary systems with strong bicameralism and when executive/legislature relations are constrained by checks and balances. Confirmation of these results is also provided by linking our approach to the fiscal institutionalist approach based on the form of fiscal governance and the stringency of fiscal rules. In terms of institutional capacity, if fiscal rules and legislative organizational and research capacity counter the executive’s monopoly of fiscal forecasting, strengthening the legislature’s formal powers negatively influences the fiscal forecast accuracy. Indeed, strategic considerations may induce the executive to anticipate the legislature’s amendment or rejection of the tabled budget by means of more favourable economic and fiscal assumptions. The crisis and its urgencies crisis seem to have weakened the effect of institutional executive/legislature relations on fiscal forecast accuracy...|$|R
