Human races are viewed not as discrete, or Platonic, categories, but rather as breeding populations that, as a result of natural selection, have come to differ statistically in the relative frequencies of many polymorphic genes. The genetic distances between various populations form a <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> that can be measured in terms of differences in gene frequencies. Racial populations differ in many genetic characteristics, some of which, such as brain size, have behavioral and psychometric correlates, particularly g.|$|E

2500|$|A {{histogram}} is {{an accurate}} graphical representation {{of the distribution of}} numerical data. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> (quantitative variable) and was first introduced by Karl Pearson. It is a kind of bar graph.

2500|$|The {{central limit theorem}} applies in {{particular}} to sums of independent and identically distributed discrete random variables. [...] A sum of discrete random variables is still a discrete random variable, so that we are confronted with a sequence of discrete random variables whose cumulative probability distribution function converges towards a cumulative probability distribution function corresponding to a <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> (namely that of the normal distribution). [...] This means that if we build a histogram of the realisations of the sum of [...] independent identical discrete variables, the curve that joins the centers of the upper faces of the rectangles forming the histogram converges toward a Gaussian curve as [...] approaches infinity, this relation is known as de Moivre–Laplace theorem. The binomial distribution article details such an application of the central limit theorem in the simple case of a discrete variable taking only two possible values.|$|E

2500|$|In economics, {{discrete}} choice models, or qualitative choice models, describe, explain, {{and predict}} choices between {{two or more}} discrete alternatives, such as entering or not entering the labor market, or choosing between modes of transport. Such choices contrast with standard consumption models in which the quantity of each good consumed {{is assumed to be}} a <b>continuous</b> <b>variable.</b> In the continuous case, calculus methods (e.g. first-order conditions) can be used to determine the optimum amount chosen, and demand can be modeled empirically using regression analysis. On the other hand, discrete choice analysis examines situations in which the potential outcomes are discrete, such that the optimum is not characterized by standard first-order conditions. Thus, instead of examining “how much” as in problems with continuous choice variables, discrete choice analysis examines “which one.” However, discrete choice analysis {{can also be used to}} examine the chosen quantity when only a few distinct quantities must be chosen from, such as the number of vehicles a household chooses to own [...] and the number of minutes of telecommunications service a customer decides to purchase. Techniques such as logistic regression and probit regression can be used for empirical analysis of discrete choice.|$|E
