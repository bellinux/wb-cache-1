Second, I conducted a survey experiment in which individuals were randomly assigned one of four potential frames, and I analyzed the effects of these frames on attitudes towards background checks. The paper finds that pro-gun control interest groups frame gun control in the context of safety and emotions, while anti-gun control groups use an anti-elite argument against expanded background checks. In addition, I find that there is high support for expanded background checks no matter which frame is presented to individuals, but using the Second Amendment in a negative framing fashion does somewhat diminish support...|$|R

The nectar use by songbirds in Europe {{is reported}} by many authors but {{several of them}} refer to local or occasional events on both introduced and native plants. A {{study carried out on}} Ventotene Island (Italy) shows that nectar could be an important food resource for migrants which land at stopover sites. In this study we investigated the distribution of nectar feeding behaviour at Mediterranean stopover sites in <b>spring,</b> <b>checking</b> 10 species for the presence of pollen on plumage during ringing activities carried out at 14 stopover sites placed in Spain, Italy and Greece. Moreover we investigated the possible relationship between nectar consumption by migrants and vegetation at three stopover sites, through the time budget analysis of 8 species during no-flight activities. Sylvia and Phylloscopus species were often found to use nectar, the former more frequently than the latter. However, nectar exploitation results usual only at 2 Mediterranean sites out of 14, Ventotene and Antikythira (Greece), while it seems to be common at African stopover sites. The analysis of time budget and the pattern of nectar feeding distribution at stopover sites suggests that in the Mediterranean region nectar consumption is most likely related to the youngest phases of vegetation, these possibly being richer in flowering plants potentially usable by songbirds...|$|R

These two application periods differed in regards to presence of western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), a predator of spider mites. Western flower thrips populations were high in the spring but essentially absent during the period following the summer application, providing contrasting data for effects of western flower thrips interactions with many miticides for spider mite control. Miticides tested included those currently utilized for mite control in alfalfa hay production as well as a number of new and/or potential products for alfalfa hay. In the spring testing, most treatments had more spider mites than the untreated check at three days post treatment when western flower thrips were present and actively feeding on spider mites. Two fertilizer treatments that contained high amounts of sulfur also had more spider mites than the untreated check at three days post treatment, thought due to repellency of adult western flower thrips. Many of the treatments that had more spider mites than the <b>check</b> following the <b>spring</b> application are known to have thrips activity (Zephyr, Trilogy, Dimethoate, Lorsban, etc.).

40|$|Introduction. Suicide is a {{conscious}} and deliberate extermination of one’s own life. Suicidal motives can be exogenous and endogenous. Exogenous factors are those from {{social and economic}} sphere, moral and political ones. There are numerous elements: demographic, socio-pathological, clinical-psychopathological and, in recent time, seasonal variations and meteorological characteristics {{are considered to be}} significant. Aim. On the basis of the analyzed literature the aim of this paper was to show the connection among seasonal variations, frequency and suicidal features. Methods. Numerous epidemiological analyses of suicide have found a connection between suicide and seasonal variations. The connection between seasonal variations and suicide regarding the way of committing it (violent and nonviolent one) has been <b>checked.</b> Seasons, particularly <b>spring</b> and summer, have influence on suicide, which confirms the fact that suicide rate in time corresponds with seasonal variations. Results. Suicides in younger age groups of both sexes show smaller asymmetry in seasonal distribution than in older groups. Seasonal influence on suicide rate has been proved to be bigger in men than in women. As for the connection between seasonal characteristics and suicide regarding the way of committing it (violent and nonviolent suicide) most studies show that suicide, but only the violent one, is in direct connection with seasons. Annual trend shows the peak from March to May (from early to late spring) for violent suicide. Conclusion. To have knowledge about the influence of seasonal variations on committing suicide is very important for taking adequate preventive measures, especially in those countries which have high rate of suicide...|$|R

40|$|Radiata pine {{is a major}} {{plantation}} grown wood in the Southern hemisphere, but has inferior {{dimensional stability}} and low durability compared to other commercial species and the improvement of these features {{is the focus of}} this thesis. Specifically this thesis examines the dimensional stability, durability and mechanical properties of radiata pine after heat-treatment (160 - 210 °C) in linseed oil. Changes in colour, micro-structure and chemistry with heat-treatment were studied. To optimise the treatment results, oil heat-treatment of wood was also carried out after thermo-mechanical compression of wood and the effect of the prior thermo-mechanical compression on stability, durability and mechanical properties were examined. The oil heat-treated wood turned uniformly darker in colour. The hydrophobicity (Water Repellence Efficiency-WRE up to 30 %), dimensional stability (Ant-Swelling Efficiency-ASE up to 60 %) and fungal resistance (up to 36 %) were improved with the extent of the changes mainly depending on treatment temperature. However, the mechanical properties of oil heat-treated wood were reduced compared to the untreated control group. Accelerated UV weathering tests have shown that the oil heat-treated wood retained its colour and dimensional stability better than the untreated wood (the control group). The cell wall of treated wood was intact and no distinct structural changes were observed even at the most severe treatment (210 °C for 6 hrs). The treatment resulted in changes to the wood chemical constituents, mainly the degradation of hemicelluloses which is believed to be principal reason for alterations in wood properties. A study of the effect of prolong heating on the linseed oil showed an increase in viscosity with heating time which in turn reduced the oil uptake and water repellency of treated wood. However, {{no significant difference in the}} colour and dimensional stability of the treated wood was noticed with oil of different heating ages. Oil absorbed by the wood during heat treatment was removed by organic solvent extraction and its contribution to the weight percentage change and moisture related properties were evaluated. The oil uptake percentage, determined by organic solvent extraction, was greater than the weight percentage loss that was deduced to occur during the heat treatment phase, which was attributed to mass losses or thermal degradation of wood constituents. Moisture excluding efficiency decreased after removal of the oil from treated wood, which suggested that the hydrophobicity of treated wood is affected by oil absorbtion. The influence of the post-treatment cooling period on properties of treated wood was studied separately. Oil uptake increased substantially with the post-treatment cooling time which in turn affected the hydrophobicity of treated wood although this effect was less important to dimensional stability. The loss of mechanical properties due to heat-treatment was successfully countered by thermo-mechanical compression of wood prior to the oil heat-treatment. The wood was compressed to 39 % of its original thickness without any visible surface <b>checks</b> and cracks. <b>Spring</b> back and compression set recovery in densified wood decreased after oil heat-treatment. This combination treatment also resulted in improved fungal resistance compared to untreated wood. From this research, it is concluded that oil heat-treatment of radiata pine wood can improve its dimensional stability and durability obviating the need to introduce any persistent toxic chemicals. Thermo-mechanical densification of wood prior to oil heat-treatment can countered the loss of mechanical properties due to heat-treatment. The heating oil can be re-used in subsequent treatments and oil uptake can be minimised by limiting the post-treatment cooling time without any significant effect on the dimensional stability of treated wood...|$|R
