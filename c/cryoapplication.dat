40|$|Objective Headache {{has been}} {{reported}} to occur during cryoballoon ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). No study has systematically analyzed this phenomenon. Methods Twenty consecutive patients with symptomatic AF, underwent cryoballoon ablation without sedation. Headache was evaluated before, during and after the first <b>cryoapplication</b> in every pulmonary vein (PV) using a visual representation of a head for location of the headache, a numerical rating scale (NRS) for measuring pain intensity and the short-form McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ) for qualitative analysis of pain. The order in which the PVs were ablated, was randomized. Results Sixteen (80 %) patients perceived mainly frontal headache during cryoablation. The overall NRS scores were significantly higher during (5. 1 ± 1. 7), compared to before (2. 7 ± 1. 4), and after (3. 5 ± 2. 2) a <b>cryoapplication</b> (p< 0. 05). The NRS score was significantly higher during ablation of the first PV. The intensity of the perceived headache was not related to the temperature reached 150 s after initiation of a <b>cryoapplication</b> (p = 0, 81). Of the MPQ, 3 sensory adjectives and 1 affective adjective averaged between score 1 and 2, representing mild to moderate severity of pain. Conclusions The majority of patients treated by balloon cryoablation, experienced headache during a <b>cryoapplication.</b> There was no correlation between the temperature reached during a cryoballoon freeze and the intensity of the headache. Cryoballoon ablation of the first PV, was significantly more painfull than the remaining PVPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Compared {{with the}} first-generation Arctic Front cryoballoon (ARC-CB), the new Arctic Front Advance cryoballoon (ARC-Adv-CB) {{increases}} the efficient CB-tissue contact surface during freezing, which {{may increase the}} incidence of phrenic nerve (PN) palsy (PNP). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation with the ARC-Adv-CB {{as well as the}} merits of a predictor of PNP. METHODS: AF ablation was performed by using a "single 28 -mm big CB" approach. The rate of pulmonary vein (PV) isolation with a first <b>cryoapplication</b> was measured. The distance between the CB and a PN pacing catheter in the superior vena cava was measured to predict PNP during freezing. RESULTS: In 147 patients, PV were isolated with a single <b>cryoapplication</b> in 205 (81. 3 %) of 252 PV treated with the ARC-CB and in 280 (90. 3 %) of 310 PV treated with the ARC-Adv-CB (P =. 003). The mean time to PV isolation was 52 ± 34 seconds and 40 ± 25 seconds (P <. 001) and the temperature at the time of isolation was - 36. 1 ± 10. 3 °C and - 32. 3 ± 10. 2 °C (P =. 001) in the ARC-CB and ARC-Adv-CB groups, respectively. Mean procedure and fluoroscopy durations were significantly shorter in the ARC-Adv-CB group. Transient PNP was observed in 7 (10. 6 %) and 20 (24. 4 %) of the patients treated with the ARC-CB and ARC-Adv-CB, respectively (P =. 048). The distance between the lateral edge of the CB and a vertical line through the tip of the pacing catheter accurately predicted PNP (P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The 28 -mm ARC-Adv-CB enabled more efficient ablation of paroxysmal AF and shorter procedures than did the ARC-CB.

40|$|DOI: 10. 1161 /CIRCEP. 113. 000517 2 Background- Right phrenic nerve palsy (PNP) is {{the most}} {{frequent}} complication of cryoballoon (CB) ablation. Diaphragmatic electromyography (EMG) can predict PNP with a comfortable safety margin. Our goal was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of EMG-guided phrenic nerve (PN) monitoring using a novel hepatic vein approach for prevention of PNP. Methods and Results- This study includes 57 patients (47 males) indicated for CB ablation for treatment of atrial fibrillation. During right superior pulmonary vein ablation, the PN was paced at 60 bpm and diaphragmatic compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitude was recorded via a quadripolar catheter positioned in a subdiaphragmatic hepatic vein. If a 30 % drop in CMAP amplitude was observed, ablation was discontinued with forced deflation. Reliable recording of CMAP prior to ablation was feasible in 50 / 57 patients (88 %). In 7 patients (12 %), stable PN pacing could not be achieved. In 44 / 50 patients, CMAP amplitude remained constant during <b>cryoapplication.</b> The mean value of CMAP amplitude was 639. 7 ± 240. 5 μV; mean variation wa...|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{study of}} a chronic porcine postinfarction model {{examined}} whether linear epicardial cryoablation was capable of creating large, homogenous lesions in regions of the myocardium including scarred ventricle. Endocardial and epicardial focal cryolesions were also compared {{to determine if there}} were significant differences in lesion characteristics. Methods: Eighty focal endocardial and 28 focal epicardial <b>cryoapplications</b> were delivered to eight normal caprine and four normal porcine ventricular myocardium, and 21 linear cryolesions were applied along the border of infarcted epicardial tissue in a chronic porcine infarct model in six swines. Results: Focal endocardial cryolesions in normal animals measured 9. 7 +/- 0. 4 mm (length) by 7. 3 +/- 1. 4 mm (width) by 4. 8 +/- 0. 2 mm (depth), while epicardial lesions measured 10. 2 +/- 1. 4 mm (length) by 7. 7 +/- 2 mm (width) by 4. 6 +/- 0. 9 mm (depth); P > 0. 05. Linear epicardial cryolesions in the chronic porcine infarct model measured 36. 5 +/- 7. 8 mm (length) by 8. 2 +/- 1. 3 mm (width) by 6. 0 +/- 1. 2 mm (depth). The mean depth of linear cryolesions applied to the border of the infarct scar was 7 +/- 0. 7 mm, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Conclusions:Cryoablation can create deep lesions when delivered to the ventricular epicardium. Endocardial and epicardial cryolesions created by a focal cryoablation catheter are similar in size and depth.

40|$|AIMS: Cryoballoon {{pulmonary}} vein (PV) isolation {{in patients with}} atrial fibrillation {{has proven to be}} effective in short-term and long-term follow-up. To visualise the PV anatomy, pre-ablation contrast pulmonary venography is commonly performed. Three-dimensional (3 D) computed tomography (CT) overlay is a new technique creating a live 3 D image of the left atrium by integrating a previously obtained CT scan during fluoroscopy. To evaluate the benefits of 3 D CT overlay during cryoballoon ablation, we studied the use of 3 D CT overlay versus contrast pulmonary venography in a randomised fashion in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergoing cryoballoon PV isolation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between October 2012 and June 2013, 30 patients accepted for PV isolation were randomised to cryoballoon PV isolation using either 3 D CT overlay or contrast pulmonary venography. All patients underwent a pre-procedural cardiac CT for evaluation of the anatomy of the left atrium (LA) and the PVs. In the 3 D CT overlay group, a 3 D reconstruction of the LA and PVs was made. An overlay of the CT reconstruction was then projected over live fluoroscopy. Patients in the contrast pulmonary venography group received significantly more contrast agent (77. 1 ± 21. 2 cc vs 40. 1 ± 17. 6 cc, p < 0. 001) and radiation (43. 0 ± 21. 9 [*]Gy. cm 2 vs 28. 41 ± 11. 7 [*]Gy. cm 2, p = 0. 04) than subjects in the 3 D CT overlay group. There was no difference in total procedure time, fluoroscopy time and the amount of <b>cryoapplications</b> between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The use of 3 D CT overlay decreases radiation and contrast dye exposure and can assist in guiding cryoballoon-based PV isolation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{experimental}} study was to evaluate the morphological effects of different liquid nitrogen cryosurgery protocols on bone tissue. The femoral diaphyses of 42 Wistar rats were exposed to three local and sequential applications of liquid nitrogen for 1 or 2 min, intercalated with periods of 5 min of passive thawing. The animals were sacrificed after 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks and the specimens obtained were processed and analyzed histomorphologically. Histologically, an increase in bone necrosis was observed for the two protocols in the second week after cryotherapy. A significant osteogenic phase was observed after 4 weeks. Moreover, complete remodeling process was encountered {{at the end of}} the morphological observation period (12 weeks), especially on oneminute protocol. Thus, this study indicated that the 2 -min protocol produced more marked bone necrosis than the 1 -min protocol.

We investigated the use of cryoablation using a new catheter on the AV node to determine (1) if a successful site might be identified prior to the ablation itself, and (2) the pa-rameters of cryoablation of the AV node using a new cryocatheter. In eight dogs, the cryoablation catheter was advanced to the AV node to produce transient high degree AV block by lowering the temperature to a minimum of- 4 OºC (ice mapping). Transient high degree AVnode block was obtained in seven of eight animals at a mean temperature of- 39. 9 ± 11. 6 °C. No significant pathological modification was found in all animals but one and, in all cases, electrophysiological parameters of the AVnode measured before, 20 minutes, 60 minutes, and up to 56 days after <b>cryoapplication</b> were not significantly different. In the 12 other dogs, after ice mapping, cryoablation of the AV node was attempted with a single freeze-thaw cycle in 6 dogs (group I) and a double freeze-thaw cycle in the other 6 dogs (group II). Chronic complete AV block was obtained in only one animal in group I compared to all animals in group II. Ablation of the AV node is effective with a double freeze-thaw cycle using a percutaneous catheter cryoablation system. Ice mapping of the area allows for identification of the targeted site.

40|$|Cryoablation of a left {{coronary}} cusp {{ventricular tachycardia}} An otherwise healthy 19 -year-old woman {{presented with a}} history of palpitations. A 12 -lead ECG demonstrated runs of mono-morphic, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) with left bundle-branch block morphology, right-axis deviation, suggesting an idiopathic VT from a coronary cusp (figure 1, panel B). 1 Echocardiography demonstrated a structurally and functionally normal heart. She was admitted for electrophysiological evaluation and catheter ablation. Mapping of the left coronary cusp (LCC) during sinus rhythm, showed a sharp potential recorded after the ventricular electrogram (figure 1, panel A). During the clinical arrhythmia, this potential preceded the QRS complex by 40 ms (figure 1, panel B) and pace mapping at this site was perfect. Cryoablation was considered a safer approach, as the application of radio-frequency (RF) energy within an area of 10 mm of the left main coronary artery is discouraged to avoid injury. 2 The mapping catheter was replaced by a 7 Fr cryoablation catheter with a 6 mm tip electrode (Freezor Xtra, CryoCath Technologies, Montreal, Canada). An aortogram in the left anterior oblique projection was made to assess the location of the ostium of the coronary arteries (figure 2).

40|$|BackgroundLimited data {{exist on}} cryoablation of atrial {{fibrillation}} (Cryo-AF) using the newly available third-generation (Arctic Front Advance-Short Tip [AFA-ST]) cryoballoon. ObjectiveIn this multicenter study, we evaluated {{the safety and}} efficacy of Cryo-AF using the AFA-ST vs the second-generation (Arctic Front Advance [AFA]) cryoballoon. MethodsWe examined the procedural safety and efficacy and the short- and long-term clinical outcomes associated with a first-time Cryo-AF performed in 355 consecutive patients (254 / 355 [72 %] with paroxysmal AF), using either the AFA-ST (n = 102) or the AFA (n = 253) cryoballoon catheters. ResultsAcute isolation was achieved in 99. 6 % of all pulmonary veins (PVs) (AFA-ST: 100 % vs AFA: 99. 4 %; P =. 920). Time to pulmonary vein isolation was recorded in 89. 2 % of PVs using AFA-ST vs 60. 2 % using AFA (P <. 001). PVs targeted using AFA-ST required fewer applications (1. 6 ± 0. 8 vs 1. 7 ± 0. 8; P =. 023), whereas {{there were no differences}} in the balloon nadir temperature (AFA-ST: − 47. 0 °C ± 7. 3 °C vs AFA: − 47. 5 °C ± 7. 8 °C; P =. 120) or thaw time (AFA-ST: 41 ± 24 seconds vs AFA: 44 ± 28 seconds; P =. 056). However, AFA-ST was associated with shorter left atrial dwell time (43 ± 5 minutes vs 53 ± 16 minutes; P <. 001) and procedure time (71 ± 11 minutes vs 89 ± 25 minutes; P <. 001). Furthermore, Cryo-AF using AFA-ST was completed more frequently by “single-shot” PV ablation (27. 4 % vs 20. 2 %; P =. 031). Persistent phrenic nerve palsy (AFA-ST: 0 % vs AFA: 0. 8 %; P =. 507) and procedure-related adverse events (AFA-ST: 1. 0 % vs AFA: 1. 6 %; P =. 554) were similar, as was the freedom from recurrent atrial arrhythmias at 10 months of follow-up (AFA-ST: 81. 8 % vs AFA: 79. 9 %; P =. 658). ConclusionCryo-AF using the AFA-ST cryoballoon offers an enhanced ability to assess time to pulmonary vein isolation, allowing for fewer <b>cryoapplications</b> and shorter left atrial dwell time and procedure time.

40|$|BackgroundRadiofrequency (RF) {{isolation}} of pulmonary veins (PVs) {{has emerged as}} an effective treatment for patients presenting drug refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the feasibility, safety, and short-term outcome of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in paroxysmal and persistent AF patients with a new cryoballoon catheter technique (Arctic Front, Cryocath, Quebec, Canada). MethodsBetween December 2007 and April 2009, 37 patients (25 males, mean age 56 years old) with symptomatic, drug refractory, paroxysmal (n= 36) or persistent (n= 1) AF underwent circumferential antral PVI using a double lumen 23 or 28 mm cryoballoon catheter. Before discharge, all patients were subjected to 24 -hour Holter electrocardiograms, echocardiography, and esophageal endoscopy. In case of symptomatic recurrences, a second AF ablation aiming at PV isolation, was performed using RF catheter. ResultsOut of 148 treated veins, 140 were completely isolated (94. 6 %). All PVs were completely isolated in 28 / 37 patients (75. 6 %). The number of balloon applications per vein was 2. 18 ± 0. 69. The mean procedure and fluoroscopy time were 164. 8 ± 39. 3 and 32. 4 ± 12. 3 min respectively. Thirty-one patients were free of AF at hospital discharge (83. 8 %). No PV narrowing, atrio-esophageal fistula or thromboembolic event occurred. Three phrenic nerve palsy (8. 1 %) were observed after <b>cryoapplication</b> at the right superior PV. Two of them resolved immediately after cessation of cryoenergy, one resolved at 2 weeks.

40|$|IntroductionThe {{objective}} of this prospective study was to evaluate the midterm clinical outcomes of PV isolation, using a cryoballoon catheter in our center. MethodsBetween july 2006 and november 2011, 234 consecutive patients (age 56 ± 11 years, 76 % of men) with symptomatic paroxysmal (n = 162) or persistent AF (n = 72) underwent PV isolation with a 28 mm or 23 mm cryoballoon catheter. In case of AF reccurence, patients could have several procedures using cryoablation and/or PV isolation and additional linear lesions by radiofrequency. Follow-up with holter monitoring and phone calls were performed. ResultsWe successfully isolated 713 of 936 PV (76 %). In 73 patients (31 %), an irrigated-tip radiofrequency catheter was {{used to create a}} supplemental focal lesion after <b>cryoapplication</b> and 55 patients (24 %) had cavo-tricuspid isthmus line. 28 mm cryoballoon catheter was mostly used (141 procedures, 60 %). The mean overall procedural duration was 178 ± 36 min (range 120 - 285), and mean duration of fluoroscopic exposure was 9 ± 5 min (range 3 - 27). Over a median period of 20 months (range 3 - 53), 12 patients were lost to follow-up, 4 patients were deceased. At 3 months of follow-up, 78 % of patients with paroxysmal AF had remained recurrence free, vs. 69 % of patients with persistent AF. Phrenic nerve palsy was the most frequent, although reversible complication. A left atrial flutter appeared in 23 cases (11 %). Considering midterm outcomes, 68 % of patients with paroxysmal AF and 62 % of patients with persistent AF had no recurrence, after an average of 1. 3 procedures. Looking at failures, only 10 % of patients did not have any improvement after ablation. 52 % of patients were free of AF without antiarrhythmic drugs and 36 % of them had stopped anticoagulation. ConclusionPV isolation, using a cryoballoon catheter is a safe and effective strategy with a high rate of success. It can be an alternative to RF ablation but randomised comparisons are needed...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: It is {{a common}} {{observation}} that superficial freezing of normal skin and skin tumors may create a transient superficial whitening effect. In this respect, cryoscopy refers to the direct observation by dermoscopy, with or without digital recording, of the visual alterations of the frozen tissues. AIMS: To define the optimal method of cryoscopy and to describe the cryoscopy patterns of normal skin and selected skin lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The influence of (a) different cryogenic sources [solid carbon dioxide (- 78. 5 degrees C), liquid nitrogen (N(2), - 196 degrees C), and a mixture of dimethyl ether and propane (- 57 degrees C) ], (b) various application methods (spraying, cotton chill tips, copper plate), and (c) freezing time was assessed with regard to clinical feasability, visualization quality, and persistance time of the whitening effect. Cryoscopy patterns of normal skin, callosities and of histologically proven seborrheic keratoses, verrucous hamartomas, molluscum contagiosum, keratoacanthomas, viral warts, condylomas, actinic keratoses, dermatofibromas, skin tags, basal cell carcinomas, angiomas, and melanocytic naevi were assessed. RESULTS: The cryoscopy images of skin highlighted the skin lines. They appeared similar regardless of the freezing source and the application method. The aspects differed according {{to the nature of}} the lesions. The cotton chill tip method provided a longer whitening period compared with the other cold sources, both in normal and lesional skin. Hence, it represented the most convenient way for performing digital recording cryoscopy. On normal skin, <b>cryoapplication</b> was limited to about 1. 5 s due to pain, resulting in whitening times ranging from 6 to 9 s, which was too short for easy digital recording. On all studied skin tumors, a 10 -s N(2) freezing time was not experienced as painful, and blanching time persisted for 20 - 34 s, allowing easy digital recording. The whitening time was longer with increasing freezing time on both normal and lesional skin. Every single examined normal skin site and all the skin lesions showed a strong whitening effect, except heavily cornified structures, including some keratoses, callosities, and viral warts. Increased contrast of the skin surface texture was observed in almost every studied lesion. CONCLUSION: The N(2) cotton chill tip technique appeared to be the most convenient technique for cryoscopy and provided longer whitening periods compared with the other freezing sources. Pain prevented its use on normal skin, but a series of exophytic skin lesions was conveniently accessible to cryoscopy. The differences in whitening periods of various epidermal components resulted in increased visual contrast, creating typical cryoscopy images for the different exophytic skin tumors. Cryoscopy represents a novel in vivo skin imaging technique that is rapid, non-invasive, cost-effective, and easily performed. It shows both investigative and diagnostic potentials. It is remarkable that cryoscopy pictures closely resemble those yielded by skin capacitance imaging. Peer reviewe...|$|E
