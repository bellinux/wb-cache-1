Various descriptive <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> were proposed based on the organ distribution of amyloid deposits and clinical findings. Most <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> included primary (i.e., idiopathic) amyloidosis, in which no associated clinical condition was identified, and secondary amyloidosis (i.e., [...] to chronic inflammatory conditions).

5|$|Solar {{urticaria}} (SU) {{is a rare}} {{condition in}} which exposure to ultraviolet or UV radiation, or sometimes even visible light, induces a case of urticaria or hives that can appear in both covered and uncovered areas of the skin.

One <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> distinguished various types of SU based on the wavelength of the radiation that causes the breakout; another <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> is based on the type of allergen that initiates a breakout.|$|E
5|$|Swimming {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{organised}} sports for people with disabilities, and was contested at the first Summer Paralympics in 1960. Both the rules for the sport and approval of classifications were the responsibility of the Fédération International de Natation Amateur (FINA) until 1992, when the International Paralympic Committee took over the governance of classification. As of 2012, people with visual, physical and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in the sport. The <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> was originally based on medical criteria, but has since moved to one largely based on functional disability to make para-swimming more competitive. The sport is moving towards an evidence-based <b>classification</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of nominal <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> {{has long been}} thought of {{as one of the}} defining features of the Papuan languages of island New Guinea. However, while almost all of these languages do have nominal <b>classification</b> <b>systems,</b> they are, in fact, extremely divergent from each other. This paper examines these systems in the East Papuan languages in order to examine the question of the relationship between these Papuan outliers. Nominal <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> are often archaic, preserving older features lost elsewhere in a language. Also, evidence shows that they are not easily borrowed into languages (although they can be). For these reasons, it is useful to consider nominal <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> as a tool for exploring ancient historical relationships between languages. This paper finds little evidence of relationship between the nominal <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> of the East Papuan languages as a whole. It argues that the mere {{existence of}} nominal <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> cannot be used as evidence that the East Papuan languages form a genetic family. The simplest hypothesis is that either the systems were inherited so long ago as to obscure the genetic evidence, or else the appearance of nominal <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> in these languages arose through borrowing of grammatical systems rather than of morphological forms...|$|R

5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict difficulty of tracheal intubation, including the Cormack-Lehane <b>classification</b> <b>system,</b> the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine uvula, faucial pillars and the soft palate. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane <b>classification</b> <b>system,</b> found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane <b>classification</b> <b>system.</b> Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation.

40|$|A {{number of}} national, {{regional}} and global land cover <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been developed}} to meet specific user requirements for land cover mapping exercises, independent of scale, nomenclature and quality. However, this variety of land-cover <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> limits the compatibility and comparability of land cover data. Furthermore, the current lack of interoperability between different land cover datasets, often stemming from incompatible land cover <b>classification</b> <b>systems,</b> makes analysis of multi-source, heterogeneous land cover data for various applications a very difficult task. This paper provides a critical review of the harmonization of land cover <b>classification</b> <b>systems,</b> which facilitates the generation, use and analysis of land cover maps consistently. Harmonization of existing land cover <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> is essential to improve their cross-comparison and validation for understanding landscape patterns and changes.

40|$|Most {{empirical}} and numerical {{approaches to}} design in rock mechanics incorporate rock mass classification. Numerical design methods generally use classification values to calculate input parameters for stress-based failure criteria. Empirical methods use classification to allow comparisons between similar rock mass conditions, generally {{based on a}} graphical design technique that differentiates stable and failed opening geometries. <b>Classification</b> <b>systems</b> are the best tool available for assessing rock mass properties; however, {{there are problems with}} <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> that should be high-lighted. Rock mass performance can only be realistically estimated by coupling a unique description of the rock mass with known loading conditions. Current <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> cannot provide a unique classification value. The weightings applied to quantify rock mass properties for classification can result in significantly different rock masses having the same classification values. These weightings have been proven effective for tunnel design and support, but <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> are now used for many more applications. Rock <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> evolved from a quick and easy field tool for estimating tunnel stability and support requirements. The need for a rapid field tool means that rock mass classification is relatively insensitive to improved methods of measuring rock mass properties. Problems with <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> and their application are highlighted in this paper. These problems must be recognized and documented before improvements can be made. An understanding of the evolution of <b>classification</b> <b>systems</b> and their application for both numerical and empirical design approaches is invaluable in highlighting current shortcomings...|$|R
