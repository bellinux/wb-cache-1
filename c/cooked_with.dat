5|$|Riesling {{is almost}} never {{fermented}} or aged in new oak (although large old oak barrels {{are often used}} to store and stabilize Riesling based wines in Germany and Alsace). This means that Riesling tends to be lighter weight and therefore suitable to {{a wider range of}} foods. The sharp acidity/sweetness in Rieslings can serve as a good balance to foods that have a high salt content. In Germany, cabbage is sometimes <b>cooked</b> <b>with</b> riesling to reduce the vegetable's smell.|$|E
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of households in low-income countries <b>cook</b> <b>with</b> firewood, which is known to produce various airborne toxins. We examine whether cooking with firewood results in poorer respiratory health by using a unique Indonesian household survey that collected direct measures of lung capacity. We find that individuals living in households that <b>cook</b> <b>with</b> firewood have 9. 4 per cent lower lung capacity than those that <b>cook</b> <b>with</b> cleaner fuels. This impact is larger for women and children than for men. The results strongly support the international policy focus on facilitating households to switch to cooking with cleaner fuels...|$|R

5|$|A common snack in Africa is Koki or Moyin-Moyin, {{where the}} cowpeas are mashed into a paste and then wrapped in banana leaves. They {{also use the}} cowpea paste as a {{supplement}} in infant formula when weaning babies off milk. Slaves brought to America and the West Indies cooked cowpeas {{much the same way}} as they did in Africa, although many people in the American South considered cowpeas not suitable for human consumption. A popular dish was Hoppin' John, which contained black-eyed peas <b>cooked</b> <b>with</b> rice and seasoned with pork. Over time cowpeas became more universally accepted and now Hoppin' John is seen as a traditional Southern dish ritually served on New Year's Day.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, a {{researcher}} in Devon discovered {{a list of}} ingredients for a pasty tucked inside an audit book and dated 1510, calculating the cost of making a venison pasty. This replaced the previous oldest recipe, dated 1746, held by the Cornwall Records Office in Truro, Cornwall. The dish {{at the time was}} <b>cooked</b> <b>with</b> venison, in this case from the Mount Edgcumbe estate, as the pasty was then considered a luxury meal. Alongside the ledger, which included the price of the pasty in Plymouth, Devon, in 1509, the discovery sparked a controversy between the neighbouring counties of Devon and Cornwall as to the origin of the dish. However, the term pasty appears in much earlier written records {{from other parts of the}} country, as mentioned above.|$|E
