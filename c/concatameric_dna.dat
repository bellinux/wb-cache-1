40|$|A microarray-based {{method has}} been {{developed}} for scoring thousands of DNAs for a co-dominant molecular marker on a glass slide. The approach was developed to detect insertional polymorphism of transposons and works well with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Biotin- terminated allele-specific PCR products are spotted unpurified onto streptavidin-coated glass slides and visualised by hybridisation of fluorescent detector oligonucleotides to tags attached to the allele- specific PCR primers. Two tagged primer oligonucleotides are used per locus and each tag is detected by hybridisation to a <b>concatameric</b> <b>DNA</b> probe labelled with multiple fluorochromes...|$|E
40|$|Ten temperature-sensitive mutants of T 4 D {{have been}} {{examined}} to find the times in the lytic cycle at which a shift to a restrictive temperature no longer exerts a lethal effect. Nine of these mutants {{play a role in}} phage DNA synthesis. The results of these experiments suggest that the products of three of the genes tested—genes 42, 44, and 45 —have control or complexing functions in addition to any enzymatic ones. The data also indicate that the products of genes 30 and 41 may act cooperatively. The properties of mutants of gene 43 (DNA polymerase) and gene 56 (dCTP-dUTPase) suggest that the production of a certain length of <b>concatameric</b> <b>DNA</b> is necessary before viable phage can be produced...|$|E
40|$|A mutant of λ was {{isolated}} that {{grows in the}} Escherichia coli himAΔ/gyrB-him 320 (Ts) double mutant at 42 °C; conditions which are non-permissive for wild-type λ growth. The responsible mutation, ohm 1, alters the 40 th codon of the Nul reading frame. The Nul and A gene products comprise the terminase protein which cleaves <b>concatameric</b> <b>DNA</b> into unit-length phage genomes during DNA packaging. The Nul-ohm 1 gene product acts in trans to support λ growth in the double himA/gyrB mutant, and λ cos 154 growth in the single himA mutant. The observation that an alteration in Nul suppresses the inhibition {{of growth in the}} double himA/gyrB mutant implicates DNA gyrase, as well as integration host factor, in the DNA: protein interactions that occur at the initiation of packaging. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe UL 33 gene of {{herpes simplex}} virus 1 (HSV- 1) encodes a protein (pUL 33) that is {{essential}} for the cleavage and packaging of <b>concatameric</b> herpesvirus <b>DNA</b> into preformed capsids. Previous data have suggested that the UL 33 protein interacts with the cleavage and packaging proteins encoded by UL 15 and UL 28 that are known to associate with capsids. Examination of purified A capsids that lack DNA and are derived from aborted packaging events, B capsids that lack DNA, and C capsids that contain DNA revealed an association of the UL 33 protein with all three capsid types. More UL 33 protein was detected in A capsids than was present in B capsids. Capsid association was susceptible to guanidine–HCl treatment and independent of the presence of UL 15 or UL 28. Capsid association of pUL 33 was also independent of UL 6, which is believed to encode the portal into which DNA is inserted. These data suggest that pUL 33 may act as part of the capsid-associated molecular machinery that translocates cleaved genomic DNA into the capsid interior...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNovobiocin {{inhibits}} the {{replication of}} vaccinia virus in cultured BSC 40 cells. All classes of viral proteins were synthesized during synchronous {{infection in the}} presence of drug. The onset of DNA replication was delayed slightly, yet the extent of DNA replication {{in the presence of}} novobiocin was comparable to that of a control infection. A delay in the temporal transition to late viral protein synthesis was in keeping with the effects on DNA replication. Although the precursor forms of the major viral structural proteins were synthesized normally at late times, the proteolytic processing of these polypeptides was inhibited, which suggested an impediment to virus assembly. Electron microscopy revealed that novobiocin blocked virus morphogenesis at an early stage. Conversion of the <b>concatameric</b> <b>DNA</b> replication intermediates into hairpin telomeres occurred in the presence of novobiocin, confirming that telomere resolution was not coupled to virus assembly. Novobiocin is the latest addition to a class of antipoxviral agents, which includes rifampin and IMCBH, that arrest morphogenesis...|$|E
40|$|To detect {{changes in}} capsid {{structure}} that occur when a preassembled bacteriophage T 7 capsid both packages and cleaves to mature-size longer (<b>concatameric)</b> <b>DNA,</b> the kinetics and thermodynamics are determined {{here for the}} binding of the protein-specific probe, 1, 1 '-bi(4 -anilino) naphthalene- 5, 5 '-di-sulfonic acid (bis-ANS), to bacteriophage T 7, a T 7 DNA deletion (8. 4 %) mutant, and a DNA-free T 7 capsid (metrizamide low density capsid II) {{known to be a}} DNA packaging intermediate that has a permeability barrier not present in a related capsid (metrizamide high density capsid II). Initially, some binding to either bacteriophage or metrizamide low density capsid II occurs too rapidly to quantify (phase 1, duration < 10 s). Subsequent binding (phase 2) occurs with first-order kinetics. Only the phase 1 binding occurs for metrizamide high density capsid II. These observations, together with both the kinetics of the quenching by ethidium of bound bis-ANS fluorescence and the nature of bis-ANS-induced protein alterations, are explained by the hypothesis that the phase 2 binding occurs at internal sites. The number of these internal sites increases as the density of the packaged DNA decreases. The accompanying change in structure is potentially the signal for initiating cleavage of a concatemer. Evidence for the following was also obtained: (a) a previously undetected packaging-associated change in the conformation of the major protein of the outer capsid shell and (b) partitioning by a permeability barrier of the interior of the T 7 capsid...|$|E
40|$|The UL 15 gene of {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1), like UL 6, UL 17, UL 28, UL 32, and UL 33, is {{required}} for cleavage of <b>concatameric</b> <b>DNA</b> into genomic lengths and for packaging of cleaved genomes into preformed capsids. A previous study indicated that the UL 15 gene encodes minor capsid proteins. In the present study, we {{have shown that the}} amino-terminal 509 amino acids of the UL 15 -encoded protein are sufficient to confer capsid association inasmuch as a carboxyl-terminally truncated form of the UL 15 -encoded protein with an Mr of approximately 55, 000 readily associated with capsids. This and previous studies have shown that, whereas three UL 15 -encoded proteins with apparent Mrs of 83, 000, 80, 000, and 79, 000 associated with wild-type B capsids, only the full-length 83, 000 -Mr protein associated with B capsids purified from cells infected with viruses lacking functional UL 6, UL 17, UL 28, UL 32, and UL 33 genes (B. Salmon and J. D. Baines, J. Virol. 72 : 3045 – 3050, 1998). Thus, all viral mutants that fail to cleave viral DNA into genomic-length molecules also fail to produce capsid-associated UL 15 80, 000 - and 79, 000 -Mr proteins. In contrast, the 80, 000 - and 79, 000 -Mr proteins were readily detected in capsids purified from cells infected with a UL 25 null virus that cleaves, but does not package, DNA. The conclusion that the amino terminus of the 83, 000 -Mr protein is truncated to produce the 80, 000 - and/or 79, 000 -Mr protein was supported by the following observations. (i) Whereas the C termini of the 83, 000 -, 80, 000 -, and 79, 000 -Mr proteins are identical, immunoreactivity dependent on the first 35 amino acids of the UL 15 83, 000 -Mr protein was absent from the 80, 000 - and 79, 000 -Mr proteins. (ii) The 79, 000 - and 80, 000 -Mr proteins were detected in capsids from cells infected with HSV- 1 (UL 15 M 36 V), an engineered virus encoding valine rather than methionine at codon 36. Thus, initiation at codon 36 is unlikely to account for production of the 80, 000 - and/or 79, 000 -Mr protein. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that capsid-associated UL 15 -encoded protein is proteolytically cleaved near the N terminus and indicate that this modification is tightly linked to maturation of genomic DNA...|$|E
40|$|During DNA replication, the hairpin telomeres of Minute Virus of Mice (MVM) are {{extended}} and copied to create imperfectly palindromic duplex junction sequences that bridge adjacent genomes in <b>concatameric</b> replicative-form <b>DNA.</b> These are {{resolved by the}} viral initiator protein, NS 1, but mechanisms employed at the two telomeres differ. Left-end:left-end junctions are resolved asymmetrically at a single site, OriLTC, by NS 1 acting in concert with a host factor, parvovirus initiation factor (PIF). Replication segregates doublet and triplet sequences, initially present as unpaired nucleotides in the bubble region of the left-end hairpin stem, {{to either side of}} the junction. These act as spacers between the NS 1 and PIF binding sites, and their asymmetric distribution sets up active (OriLTC) and inactive (OriLGAA) forms of OriL. We used a reverse genetic approach to disrupt this asymmetry and found that neither opposing doublets nor triplets in the hairpin bubble were tolerated. Viable mutants were isolated at low frequency and found to contain second-site mutations that either restored the asymmetry or crippled one PIF binding site. These mutations either inactivated the inboard or activated the outboard form of OriL, a polarity that strongly suggests that, in the genus Parvovirus, an active inboard OriL is lethal...|$|R
40|$|In {{our search}} for novel inhibitors of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1), {{a new class of}} {{thiourea}} inhibitors was discovered. N-{ 4 -[3 -(5 -Chloro- 2, 4 -dimethoxyphenyl) -thioureido]-phenyl}-acetamide and its 2 -fluoro-benzamide derivative inhibited HSV- 1 replication. HSV- 2, human cytomegalovirus, and varicella-zoster virus were inhibited to a lesser extent. The compounds acted late in the replication cycle by impairing both the cleavage of <b>concatameric</b> viral <b>DNA</b> into progeny genome length and the packaging of the DNA into capsids, indicative of a defect in the encapsidation process. To uncover the molecular target of the inhibition, resistant HSV- 1 isolates were generated, and the mutation responsible for the resistance was mapped using marker transfer techniques. Each of three independent isolates had point mutations in the UL 6 gene which resulted in independent single-amino-acid changes. One mutation was located in the N terminus of the protein (E 121 D), while two were located close together in the C terminus (A 618 V and Q 621 R). Each of these point mutations was sufficient to confer drug resistance when introduced into wild-type virus. The UL 6 gene is one of the seven HSV- 1 genes known {{to play a role in}} DNA packaging. This novel class of inhibitors has provided a new tool for dissection of HSV- 1 encapsidation mechanisms and has uncovered a new viable target for the treatment of herpesviral diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{proteins}} {{produced by}} the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) genes UL 15 and UL 28 are believed to form part of the terminase enzyme, a protein complex essential for the cleavage of newly synthesized, <b>concatameric</b> herpesvirus <b>DNA</b> and the packaging of the resultant genome lengths into preformed capsids. This work describes the purification of recombinant forms of pUL 15 and pUL 28, which allowed the calculation of {{the average number of}} copies of each protein in A and B capsids and in capsids lacking the putative portal encoded by UL 6. On average, 1. 0 (± 0. 29 [standard deviation]) copies of pUL 15 and 2. 4 (± 0. 97) copies of pUL 28 were present in B capsids, 1. 2 (± 0. 72) copies of pUL 15 and 1. 5 (± 0. 86) copies of pUL 28 were found in mutant capsids lacking the putative portal protein pUL 6, and approximately 12. 0 (± 5. 63) copies of pUL 15 and 0. 6 (± 0. 32) copies of pUL 28 were present in each A capsid. These results suggest that the packaging machine is partly comprised of approximately 12 copies of pUL 15, as found in A capsids, with wild-type B and mutant UL 6 (−) capsids containing an incomplete complement of cleavage and packaging proteins. These results are consistent with observations that B capsids form by default in the absence of packaging machinery in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, A capsids {{may be the result of}} initiated but aborted attempts at DNA packaging, resulting in the retention of at least part of the DNA packaging machinery...|$|R
