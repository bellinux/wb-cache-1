25|$|The {{burning of}} harder, older {{anthracite}} and bituminous coal typically produces Class F fly ash. This fly ash is pozzolanic in nature, and contains less than 7% lime (CaO). Possessing pozzolanic properties, the glassy silica and alumina of Class F fly ash requires a cementing agent, such as Portland cement, quicklime, or hydrated lime—mixed {{with water to}} react and produce <b>cementitious</b> compounds. Alternatively, adding a chemical activator such as sodium silicate (water glass) to a Class F ash can form a geopolymer.|$|E
25|$|Portland cement {{is by far}} {{the most}} common type of cement in general use around the world. This cement is made by heating {{limestone}} (calcium carbonate) with other materials (such as clay) to 1450°C in a kiln, in a process known as calcination, whereby a molecule of carbon dioxide is liberated from the calcium carbonate to form calcium oxide, or quicklime, which then chemically combines with the other materials that have been included in the mix to form calcium silicates and other <b>cementitious</b> compounds. The resulting hard substance, called 'clinker', is then ground with a small amount of gypsum into a powder to make 'ordinary Portland cement', the most commonly used type of cement (often referred to as OPC).|$|E
2500|$|Many {{types of}} {{concrete}} are available, distinguished by {{the proportions of}} the main ingredients below. In this way or by substitution for the <b>cementitious</b> and aggregate phases, the finished product can be tailored to its application. [...] Strength, density, as well chemical and thermal resistance are variables.|$|E
2500|$|Cement, most {{commonly}} Portland cement, {{is associated with}} the general term [...] "concrete." [...] A range of other materials can be used as the cement in concrete too. [...] One of the most familiar of these alternative cements is asphalt concrete. Other <b>cementitious</b> materials such as fly ash and slag cement, are sometimes added as mineral admixtures (see below) - either pre-blended with the cement or directly as a concrete component - and {{become a part of the}} binder for the aggregate.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the friction and interlocking (dilatancy) components of strength, the structure and fabric also {{play a significant role}} in the soil behavior. [...] The structure and fabric include factors such as the spacing and arrangement of the solid particles or the amount and spatial distribution of pore water; in some cases <b>cementitious</b> material accumulates at particle-particle contacts. Mechanical behavior of soil is affected by the density of the particles and their structure or arrangement of the particles as well as the amount and spatial distribution of fluids present (e.g., water and air voids). Other factors include the electrical charge of the particles, chemistry of pore water, chemical bonds (i.e. cementation -particles connected through a solid substance such as recrystallized calcium carbonate) ...|$|E
2500|$|Workability is {{the ability}} of a fresh (plastic) {{concrete}} mix to fill the form/mold properly with the desired work (vibration) and without reducing the concrete's quality. Workability depends on water content, aggregate (shape and size distribution), <b>cementitious</b> content and age (level of hydration) and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizer. Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability. Excessive water leads to increased bleeding or segregation of aggregates (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate blend with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump, which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water. An undesirable gradation can mean using a large aggregate that is too large for the size of the formwork, or which has too few smaller aggregate grades to serve to fill the gaps between the larger grades, or using too little or too much sand for the same reason, or using too little water, or too much cement, or even using jagged crushed stone instead of smoother round aggregate such as pebbles. [...] Any combination of these factors and others may result in a mix which is too harsh, i.e., which does not flow or spread out smoothly, is difficult to get into the formwork, and which is difficult to surface finish.|$|E
