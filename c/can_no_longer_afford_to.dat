Anmar passes the retakes and aspires to study English {{literature}} in college, and his family decide to move to the safer region of Arbul now that he has graduated. Hyder also retakes his exams and passes, but his family <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> pay for the university fees. Ali chooses not to retake the exams, and his family leave Iraq. Mohammad fails four subjects and must repeat his senior year. He chooses to do so at a different school while working at his uncle's scooter repair shop. As the documentary closes, it notes that during the year of filming, two of the boys' classmates were killed, six were kidnapped, and seventy-five left Iraq.|$|E

2500|$|The {{combination}} of Mill Valley's idyllic location nestled beneath Mount Tamalpais coupled with its relative ease {{of access to}} nearby San Francisco has made it a popular home for many high-income commuters. Over the last 30 years, following a trend that is endemic throughout the Bay Area, home prices have climbed in Mill Valley (the median price for a single-family home was in excess of $1.5 million as of 2005), which has {{had the effect of}} pushing out some residents who <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> live in the area.

2500|$|A French sociologist, Sylvain Crépon, who {{analysed}} {{the social}} and occupational groups of the FN voters in 2012, explained: [...] "The FN vote {{is made up of}} the victims of globalisation. It is the small shopkeepers who are going under because of the economic crisis and competition from the out-of-town hypermarkets; it is low-paid workers from the private sector; the unemployed. The FN scores well among people living in poverty, who have a real fear about how to make ends meet." [...] Crépon also analysed the increase of the FN vote in [...] "rural" [...] areas and the recent sociological changes in these areas made up of small provincial towns and new housing-estate commuter belts built on the distant outskirts of the cities: [...] "The rural underclass is no longer agricultural. It is people who have fled the big cities and the inner suburbs because they <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> live there. Many of these people will have had recent experience of living in the banlieues (high immigration suburbs) – and have had contact with the problems of insecurity."

5000|$|Toronto Pride Week has {{not been}} without controversy, as {{the growth of the}} event in recent years has led to {{allegations}} that it has become an overly commercial enterprise dependent on corporate sponsors and business interests, to the detriment of local community groups and political activism. Although Pride officially defines itself as inclusive of all races, communities and gender identifications, many such groups within the LGBT community have alleged that their events and communities and issues are increasingly marginalized in favour of a commercialized agenda. For example, many smaller community groups have indicated that they <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> the increased fees required to place a marching contingent in the parade, which is increasingly dominated by corporate-sponsored advertising floats; and many LGBTQ-owned small businesses which historically depended on vendor booths at Pride Toronto for publicity have indicated that they <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> the increased fees for inclusion in the vendor area.|$|R

6000|$|We want to {{have our}} young people filled with a new {{realisation}} that History is not over, that nothing is settled, and that the supreme dramatic phase {{in the story of}} England has still to come. It was not in the Norman Conquest, not in the flight of King James II, nor the overthrow of Napoleon; it is here and now. It falls to them to be actors not in a reminiscent pageant but a living conflict, and the sooner they are prepared to take their part in that the better our Empire will acquit itself. How absurd is the preoccupation of our schools and colleges with the little provincialisms of our past history before A.D. 1800!

[...] And he pours into our country every year a fresh supply of gentlemanly cricketing youths, gapingly unprepared--unless they have picked up a broad generalisation or so from some surreptitious Socialist pamphlet--for the immense issues they must control, and that are altogether uncontrollable if they fail to control them. The universities do scarcely more for our young men. All this has to be altered, and altered vigorously and soon, if our country is to accomplish its destinies.
