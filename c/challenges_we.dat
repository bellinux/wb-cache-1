The editorial in Dawn also echoed that [...] "the country's civil and military leaderships will unite to condemn the attacks and bemoan them as an attempt to sabotage CPEC by outside forces.

2500|$|Another {{article titled}} [...] "The Hillary Doctrine", {{published}} in The Atlantic in January 2013 by journalist David Rohde, {{talks about the}} terms of exchanges between Clinton and other American politicians within discussions of dilemmas concerning the United States and certain African countries. This time, Clinton explicitly called out actions taken by the United States abroad, and argued that, contrary to popular belief, [...] "a lot of the <b>challenges</b> <b>we</b> face are not immediately – or sustainably – solved by military action alone." [...] Further, while the aforementioned doctrine focuses on populations, such as women and children, that are typically ignored within discussions of national security, Clinton also makes an effort to push for including places that have historically been ignored within national security discussions, as well. However, Rohde never mentions the phrase [...] "Hillary Doctrine" [...] in the piece, {{and it could have}} been the creation of the magazine's headline writer.|$|E

2500|$|In 2017 {{a report}} on the ship's {{condition}} was issued. [...] The report noted that not only the hull but also the supports for a raised exhibition area within the ship were corroding, and that the ship's deteriorating condition left areas such as the engine room vulnerable to flooding. Repairs were estimated at close to $300 million. In November 2016 the City of Long Beach had put $23 million toward addressing the Queen Marys most vital repairs. John Keisler, economic and property development director for Long Beach, said, [...] "We have a timeline in which the engineers believe they can complete those immediate projects. These are major <b>challenges</b> <b>we</b> can only address over time; it can't all be done at once."

30|$|In phase 1, we {{conducted}} an exploratory study {{to explore the}} hyperspecialists phenomenon at a high level, analyzing {{the behavior of the}} participants in terms of types of <b>challenges</b> chosen. <b>We</b> collected data from more than 350, 000 Topcoder users and randomly sampled 664 to conduct phase 1. For each user, we focused on their first 18 months of interaction, starting from the date of each users’ first <b>challenge.</b> <b>We</b> split the 18 -month period into three 6 -month periods. We counted the number of challenges that each user registered for in each these periods, classifying the participation by type (in TopCoder there are three main types of challenge: design, development, and data <b>challenge).</b> <b>We</b> then analyzed the hyperspecialization phenomenon in terms of type of challenge, verifying whether their participation changed or not during the three periods, answering RQ 1 - 2.|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} modeling, {{parameter}} estimation and search challenges {{that arise from}} the introduction of reordering models that capture non-local reordering in alignment modeling. In particular, we introduce several reordering models that utilize (pairs of) function words as contexts for alignment reordering. To address the parameter estimation <b>challenge,</b> <b>we</b> propose to estimate these reordering models from a relatively small amount of manuallyaligned corpora. To address the search <b>challenge,</b> <b>we</b> devise an iterative local search algorithm that stochastically explores reordering possibilities. By capturing non-local reordering phenomena, our proposed alignment model bears a closer resemblance to stateof-the-art translation model. Empirical results show significant improvements in alignment quality {{as well as in}} translation performance over baselines in a large-scale Chinese-English translation task. ...|$|R
