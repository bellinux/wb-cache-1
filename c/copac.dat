Afterwards, he attempted a shift toward a skeptically elegiac, obsessive lyricism that dealt with regret and lack of fulfillment (Cercuri de <b>copac,</b> 1962; Drumul spre Dikson, 1969; Cetatea de pe aer, 1974).|$|E

40|$|Correlation {{clustering}} aims at {{the detection}} of data points that appear as hyperplanes in the data space and, thus, exhibit common correlations between different subsets of features. Recently proposed methods for correlation clustering usually suffer from several severe drawbacks including poor robustness against noise or parameter settings, incomplete results (i. e. missed clusters), poor usability due to complex input parameters, and poor scalability. In this paper, we propose the novel correlation clustering algorithm <b>COPAC</b> (COrrelation PArtition Clustering) that aims at improved robustness, completeness, usability, and efficiency. Our experimental evaluation empirically shows that <b>COPAC</b> is superior over existing state-of-the-art correlation clustering methods in terms of runtime, accuracy, and completeness of the results. ...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring {{cardiac output}} (CO) is {{important}} to optimize hemodynamic function in critically ill patients. The prevalence of aortic valve insufficiency (AI) is rising in the aging population. However, reliability of CO monitoring techniques in AI is unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the impact of AI on accuracy, precision, and trending ability of transcardiopulmonary thermodilution-derived COTCPTD in comparison with pulmonary artery catheter thermodilution <b>COPAC.</b> Sixteen anesthetized domestic pigs were subjected to serial simultaneous measurements of <b>COPAC</b> and COTCPTD. In a novel experimental model, AI was induced by retraction of an expanded Dormia basket in the aortic valve annulus. The Dormia basket was delivered via a Judkins catheter guided by substernal epicardial echocardiography. High (HPC), moderate (MPC) and low cardiac preload conditions (LPC) were induced by fluid unloading (20 ml kg- 1 blood withdrawal) and loading (subsequent retransfusion of the shed blood and additional infusion of 20 ml kg- 1 hydroxyethyl starch). Within each preload condition CO was measured before and after the onset of AI. For statistical analysis, we used a mixed model analysis of variance, Bland-Altman analysis, the percentage error and concordance analysis. Experimental AI had a mean regurgitant volume of 33. 6 ± 12. 0 ml and regurgitant fraction of 42. 9 ± 12. 6 %. The percentage error between COTCPTD and <b>COPAC</b> during competent valve function and after induction of substantial AI was: HPC 17. 7 % vs. 20. 0 %, MPC 20. 5 % vs. 26. 1 %, LPC 26. 5 % vs. 28. 1 % (pooled data: 22. 5 % vs. 24. 1 %). The ability to trend CO-changes induced by fluid loading and unloading did not differ between baseline and AI (concordance rate 95. 8 % during both conditions). Despite substantial AI, transcardiopulmonary thermodilution reliably measured CO under various cardiac preload conditions with a good ability to trend CO changes in a porcine model. COTCPTD and <b>COPAC</b> were interchangeable in substantial AI...|$|E
