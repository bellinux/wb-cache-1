40|$|To study multi-fractal {{behavior}} of <b>corroded</b> steel surface, {{a range of}} fractal surfaces of <b>corroded</b> surfaces of Q 235 steel were constructed by using the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot method under a high total accuracy.

Based on the shape feature of the multi-fractal spectrum of <b>corroded</b> steel surface, the least squares method {{was applied to the}} quadratic fitting of the multi-fractal spectrum of <b>corroded</b> surface.

In order {{to investigate the}} strengthening effects of aramid fiber reinforced polymer (AFRP) sheets on the flexural performance of the <b>corroded</b> beams, the flexural behaviors of <b>corroded</b> RC beams strengthened with AFRP sheets under different degrees of corrosion (minor: reinforcement mass loss is 2. 0 %, medium: reinforcement mass loss is 6. 0 %) are researched experimentally in this paper, and {{compared with that of}} the control beams (un-corroded) and un-strengthened <b>corroded</b> beams.

5|$|The {{relative}} {{reactivity of}} zinc {{and its ability}} to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe.

Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 110 inelastic {{buckling}} tests on <b>corroded</b> and uncorroded reinforcing bars with various bar diameters are conducted. Through regression analyses of experimental data the combined effect of nonuniform pitting corrosion and bar diameter (size effect) on buckling and post-yield buckling response of <b>corroded</b> and uncorroded bars are investigated. The experimental result shows that bar diameter has a minor influence on post-yield buckling response of uncorroded bars. However, {{it is found}} that bar diameter has a more significant impact on buckling capacity of <b>corroded</b> bars. Finally, the experimental data of tested <b>corroded</b> bars in this research are used to calibrate and update a new uniaxial material model of <b>corroded</b> bars to account for size effect. The proposed updated model simulates the inelastic buckling and post-buckling behaviour of <b>corroded</b> bars accounting for size effect.

40|$|Abstract. The {{failure mode}} of the <b>corroded</b> RC beam may shift from {{designed}} failure mode to others failure mode, as the load resisting mechanism changes {{due to the}} corrosion ratio of rebars. In this study, the load resisting mechanism and the failure mode of the <b>corroded</b> RC beam were investigated based on the bond performance. If the <b>corroded</b> RC beam is non-uniformly <b>corroded,</b> the beam suffers beam action and fails in flexural failure. Otherwise, the load resisting mechanism and the failure mode depend on the corrosion ratio of bottom portion stirrups. Moreover, the decision point is proposed to predict the load resisting mechanisms in the <b>corroded</b> RC beam...|$|R

30|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of a fatigue assessment model (FAM) for <b>corroded</b> members is not an easy task due to the many relevant parameters and variables that determine the fatigue behavior. Several {{attempts have been made to}} develop an FAM for <b>corroded</b> beams. The most common approaches are the stress-life and strain-life models (Ma et al. 2014; Elrefai et al. 2012). These models provide the fatigue life of members but do not predict the strain and stress distributions across the beam. Song and Yu (2015) tested beams with <b>corroded</b> steel reinforcement (<b>corroded</b> beams) strengthened with CFRP sheets and proposed an analytical fatigue prediction model (FPM) to assess the fatigue behavior of the CFRP-strengthened <b>corroded</b> beams. In this study, the effect of prestressed CFRP systems on the fatigue behavior of <b>corroded</b> RC beams was not studied. None of the available FAMs are capable of accurately assessing the fatigue behavior of <b>corroded</b> beams strengthened with prestressed CFRP. This paper presents the second phase of a research project conducted to quantify the effect of CFRP systems on the fatigue behavior of <b>corroded</b> RC beams. The first phase of the project (Song and Yu 2015) aimed to examine the effect of steel corrosion and the non-prestressed CFRP systems on the fatigue behavior of <b>corroded</b> RC beams. The results showed that non-prestressed CFRP systems are applicable to RC beams with only low corrosion degrees (0 – 4.6 %). The second phase intends to develop an overall assessment model capable of assessing the fatigue behavior of <b>corroded</b> RC beams strengthened with prestressed CFRP sheets and to discuss whether prestressed CFRP systems are applicable to RC beams with medium and high corrosion degrees.|$|R

Details of a comprehensive experiment designed to examine the mechanical behaviour of <b>corroded</b> stirrups in concrete structural members are presented.

Because corrosion is a diffusion-controlled process, it occurs on exposed surfaces.
