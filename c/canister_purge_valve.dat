40|$|This new utility patent is {{an active}} design that relies on the lung's role as an organic heat {{exchanger}} for providing deep body core heating of air. It {{is based on the}} fact that the greatest heat loss mechanism for an insulated human body immersed in a cold water environment is due to heat loss through respiration. This innovation successfully merges two existing technologies (cold immersion suit and existing valve technologies) to produce a new product that helps prevent against the onset of hypothermia at sea. During normal operations, a human maintains an approximate body temperature of [98. 6 F (37 C) ]. A mechanism was developed to recover the warm temperature from the body and reticulate it in a survival suit. The primary intention is to develop an encompassing systems design that can both easily and cost effectively be integrated in all existing currently manufactured cold water survival suits, and as such, it should be noted that the cold water immersion suit is only used as a framework or tool for laying out the required design elements. At the heart of the suit is the Warm Air Recovery (WAR) system, which relies on a single, large Main <b>Purge</b> <b>Valve</b> (MPV) and secondary <b>Purge</b> <b>Valves</b> (PV) to operate. The main <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> has a thin membrane, which is normally closed, and acts as a one-way check valve. When warm air is expelled from the lungs, it causes the main <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> to open. Air forced from the MPV is dumped directly into the suit, thereby providing warmth to the torso, legs, and arms. A slight positive over-pressure in the suit causes warm waste air (or water if the suit is punctured) to be safely vented into the sea through large PVs located at the bottom of each arm and leg. The secondary <b>purge</b> <b>valves</b> act to prevent the buildup of large concentrations of CO 2 gas and help guard against asphyxia. It is noted that the MPV causes the inhalation and exhalation cycles to be completely isolated from one another in the current suit design...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} century the petro {{chemical}} industry has provided an abundant and cheap source of hydrocarbons that have impacted and transformed many facets of our lives. Petrochemicals not only provide fuel that revolutionized transportation industry but also provided cheap petrochemical feedstock molecules that form a basis of many textiles, plastics, adhesives, detergents, and lubricants that are indispensable in modern life. Our dependence on the petrochemical industry and the sheer quantity of petrochemical based products that are consumed {{have led to a}} number of adverse and unintended effects on our environment. Recent attention to unintended effects of the petrochemical industry such as climate change, air pollution, and landfill overflow have sparked renewed interest in green chemistry and research in renewables that could potentially decrease our dependence on the petrochemical industry. Over the last two decades, with the advent of simple and cheap genetic engineering, a new field called metabolic engineering has emerged. A large focus of this field is centered around re-engineering the metabolism of simple organisms to produce bulk and specialty chemicals. We genetically engineered a lithoautotrophic organism, Ralstonia eutropha, to produce drop-in ready biofuels (isobutanol and 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol) in an electro-bio reactor using CO 2 as the sole carbon source and electricity as the sole energy input. This method integrates electrochemical formate production and biological CO 2 fixation and higher alcohol synthesis. The liquid fuels generated are a relatively stable way to store energy and possess energy densities about 100 times higher than current-day batteries. A different approach to metabolic engineering coined synthetic biochemistry seeks to reconstitute complex metabolic pathways outside of cells. The Synthetic Biochemistry approach eliminates the myriad unwanted side reactions that occur in cells and product toxicity, enabling near 100 % theoretical yields. Unfortunately, eliminating the cellular environment also eliminates key regulatory networks involved in maintaining appropriate carbon flux and cofactor balance. Synthetic biochemistry seeks to replace these complex regulatory networks in vitro by creating self-balancing pathways that automatically regulate the production and consumption of cofactors while maintaining constant carbon flux through the pathway. To this end, we developed the concept of a molecular <b>purge</b> <b>valve.</b> Generally, the <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> is made up of a NADPH dependent oxidase, a NADH dependent oxidase and a NADH specific oxidase (noxE). We first demonstrated this proof of concept by engineering the G. stearothermophilus pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to flip its cofactor specificity from NADH to NADPH and using it in the <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> to transform pyruvate to either polyhydroxybutyrate bioplastic or isoprene at near quantitative yields. The concept of using a <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> to maintain carbon flux in an inherently imbalanced pathway was expanded through the production of polyhydroxybutyrate from glucose using a synthetic pathway called the PBG cycle. The PBG cycle is made up of enzymes from the pentose phosphate pathway, the bifido shunt, and standard glycolysis (EMP). This pathway utilizes the <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> concept at the two reductase enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway and produced the bioplastic polyhydroxybutyrate from glucose. The PBG pathway ran semi-continuously for 55 hours and produced 86 % yield from 110 mM glucose. The pathway had a maximum productivity of 0. 7 g/L PHB and maintained 50 % of its productivity {{over the course of the}} 55 hours at room temperature. The PBG cycle serves as a demonstration that synthetic biochemistry could be an alternative to in vivo metabolic engineering for the production of bulk and specialty chemicals and could potentially be one way to replace some of the petrochemicals we use today with renewable bio-based chemicals...|$|R

50|$|Many hookahs are {{equipped}} with a <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> connected to the airspace in the water jar to purge stale smoke that has been sitting unused in the jar for too long. This one-way valve is typically a simple ball bearing sitting over a port that seals the port by gravity alone and will open if positive pressure is created by blowing into the hose. The bearing is held captive with a screw-on cover. The cover should be opened and the bearing and seat cleaned of residue and corrosion regularly to ensure proper sealing.|$|R
5000|$|Deposits {{reduce the}} heat {{transfer}} in the boiler, reduce the flow rate and eventually block boiler tubes. Any non-volatile salts and minerals that will remain when the feedwater is evaporated must be removed, because they will become concentrated in the liquid phase and require excessive [...] "blow-down" [...] (draining) to prevent the formation of solid precipitates. Even worse are minerals that form scale. Therefore, the make-up water added to replace any losses of feedwater must be demineralized/deionized water, unless a <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> is used to remove dissolved minerals.|$|R

50|$|Other freeflows may {{be caused}} by the second stage valve jamming due to grit or {{corrosion}} products fouling the movement of the valve poppet, or the <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> sticking in the depressed position. These can sometimes be stopped by pressing the purge button a few times to free up the works. If all else fails, the diver can breathe from a freeflowing demand valve by allowing excess air to escape from the sides of the mouth and the exhaust valve, which may allow a safe ascent, or at least the use of as much remaining gas as possible. When a full-face mask is used, excess gas will be vented through the exhaust valve and around the mask skirt, usually allowing the diver to continue to breathe without difficulty during the freeflow. This does not help after the cylinder has emptied.|$|R

If the mask is a good fit on the diver's face and the strap is correctly placed, exhaling through the nose will usually drive water out along the bottom edge of the skirt. It {{may be necessary to}} press {{the upper part of the}} mask against the face to improve the seal if the diver is rolled to one side. If the fit is not perfect, or the strap is too low, contact pressure of the top edge against the forehead may be insufficient to maintain a seal when the head is upright.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} comply with the exhaust {{emission}} regulations that are becoming more severe every year, more advanced engine control is necessary. Engine engineers are concerned about the Hydrocarbons (HCs) that flow through the air-intake ports and that are difficult to precisely control. The main sources of such HCs are; the <b>canister</b> <b>purge,</b> PCV, and back-flow gas through the intake valves. And the Air/Fuel ratio (A/F) may be aggravated when such HCs flow into the combustion chambers. The influence that HCs have on the A/F may even increase further due to the; increasingly stringent EVAP emission regulations, more effective ventilation in the crankcase, and growth of the VVT-operated angle and timing. In order to more precisely control the A/F, it is important to estimate the amount of HCs that are difficult to manage, and seek suitable controls over fuel injection, etc. Therefore, the authors have developed a HC concentration measuring technology of the air-intake system using FID (of which the gas sampling performance has been significantly improved). The characteristics of this new system are as follows; (1) Applicable to each point of the intake system (2) Applicable to all engine operating conditions including the transition stage (3) Gas sampling with little influence on the A/F contro...|$|R

'In this engine all we really have to lubricate is the crankshaft, the rest seems to lubricate itself' (C&D, Jul 1974). At top dead centre (TDC), the single-sleeve valve rotates in relation to the piston. This prevents boundary lubrication problems, as piston ring ridge wear at TDC and bottom dead centre (BDC) does not occur. The Bristol Hercules time between overhauls (TBO) life was rated at 3,000 hours, very good for an aircraft engine, but not so for automotive engines. Sleeve wear was located primarily in the upper part, inside the 'junk head'.|$|R

40|$|Though lots of {{numerical}} {{methods have}} been proposed in the literature to optimize me-chanical structures at {{the final stage of}} the design process, few designers use these tools since the first stage. However, a minor modification at the first step can bring significant change to the global performances of the structure. Usually, during the initial stage, models are based on theoretical and empirical equations, which are often characterized by mixed variables: continuous (e. g. geometrical dimensions), discrete (e. g. the cross section of a beam available in a catalogue) and/or integer (e. g. the number of layers in a composite material). Furthermore, the functions involved may be non differentiable, or even discontinuous. Therefore, classical algorithms based on the computation of sensi-tivities are no more applicable. Consequently, to solve these problems, the most wide-spread meta-heuristic methods are evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which work as follows: the best individuals among an initial population of randomly generated potential solutions are favoured and com-bined (by specific operators like crossover and mutation) in order to create potentially better individuals at the next generation. The creation of new generations is repeated till the convergence is reached. The ability of EAs to explore widely the design space is useful to solve single-objective unconstrained optimization problems, because it gener-ally prevents from getting trapped into a local optimum, but it is also well known that they do not perform very efficiently in the presence of constraints. Furthermore, in many industrial applications, multiple objectives are pursued together. Therefore, {{to take into account the}} constrained and multicriteria aspects of optimization problems in EAs, a new method called PAMUC (Preferences Applied to MUltiobjectiv-ity and Constraints) has been proposed in this dissertation. First the user has to assign weights to the m objectives. Then, an additional objective function is built by linearly aggregating the normalized constraints. Finally, a multicriteria decision aid method, PROMETHEE II, is used in order to rank the individuals of the population following the m+ 1 objectives.

Figure 5 {{is an example of a}} commercial GC/MS column test mixture used to evaluate GC/MS prior to analysis...|$|R
40|$|The STS- 55 initial launch attempt of Columbia (OV 102) was {{terminated}} on KSC launch pad A March 22, 1993 at 9 : 51 AM E. S. T. due to violation of an ME- 3 (Engine 2011) Launch Commit Criteria (LCC) limit exceedance. The event description and timeline are summarized. Propellant loading was initiated on 22 March, 1993 at 1 : 15 AM EST. All SSME chill parameters and launch commit criteria (LCC) were nominal. At engine start plus 1. 44 seconds, a Failure Identification (FID) was posted against Engine 2011 for exceeding the 50 psia Oxidizer Preburner (OPB) purge pressure redline. The engine {{was shut down}} at 1. 50 seconds followed by Engines 2034 and 2030. All shut down sequences were nominal and the mission was safely aborted. The OPB purge pressure redline violation and the abort profile/overlay for all three engines are depicted. SSME Avionics hardware and software performed nominally during the incident. A review of vehicle data table (VDT) data and controller software logic revealed no failure indications other than the single FID 013 - 414, OPB purge pressure redline exceeded. Software logic was executed according to requirements {{and there was no}} anomalous controller software operation. Immediately following the abort, a Rocketdyne/NASA failure investigation team was assembled. The team successfully isolated the failure cause to the oxidizer preburner augmented spark igniter <b>purge</b> check <b>valve</b> not being fully closed due to contamination. The source of the contaminant was traced to a cut segment from a rubber O-ring which was used in a fine clean tool during valve production prior to 1992. The valve was apparently contaminated during its fabrication in 1985. The valve had performed acceptably on four previous flights of the engine, and SSME flight history shows 780 combined check valve flights without failure. The failure of an Engine 3 (SSME No. 2011) check valve to close was sensed by onboard engine instruments even though all other engine operations were normal. This resulted in an engine shutdown and safe sequential shutdown of all three engines prior to ignition of the solid boosters...|$|R
40|$|A {{physical}} model simulating canister adsorption and desorption processes on activated carbon was developed from experimental {{data obtained from}} repeated tests on a single carbon canister. The model is able to predict canister behaviour under different loading and purging conditions and is thus able to predict canister breakthrough emissions. The {{physical model}} can accurately simulate butane adsorption and desorption on activated carbon. An empirical model was then developed, using simpler expressions for describing adsorption and desorption. Based on the empirical model a full evaporative emissions test procedure was simulated, enabling the calculation of evaporative emissions from canister-equipped vehicles. The fair agreement between measured and modelled emissions verifies that the empirical model {{may be used for}} the estimation of evaporative emissions from modern gasoline vehicles. For the calibration of the model extensive testing was conducted on one vehicle and for the final validation a smaller number of targeted tests were performed on other vehicles. These tests covered a wide range of parameters having an effect on evaporative emissions, namely fuel volatility, ambient temperature, canister and fuel tank sizes, fuel system materials. The source of evaporative emissions depends largely on the canister condition. A well <b>purged</b> <b>canister,</b> e. g. after extensive driving on the road, results in effective adsorption of vapour generated in the fuel tank. Evaporative emissions in this case may be attributed to fuel permeation and/or leakage rather than the canister. When the canister is close to saturation, breakthrough emissions dominate the total evaporative emissions. The empirical model is applied {{for the development of a}} methodology for the calculation of evaporative emissions from a fleet of vehicles. The development of emission factors for various vehicle categories taking into account a large number of activity data facilitates emissions inventorying. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{adaptive}} control of time delay systems with applications to automotive control problems. The stabilization of systems involving time delays is a difficult problem since {{the existence of a}} delay may induce instability or poor performance for the closed loop system. A unique approach for controlling systems with known time delay was originated by Otto Smith in the 1950 s by compensating for the delayed output using input values stored over a time window of [t - [tau], t] and estimating the plant output using a model of the plant. Later, this idea was extended to include unstable plants as well, using finite-time integrals of the delayed input values thereby avoiding unstable pole-zero cancellations that may occur in Smith's controller. Adaptive versions of these delay compensating controllers were also developed with rather complicated adaptive rules which might not be practical to use in real applications. In this thesis, a simpler adaptive version of delay compensating controllers is developed, which has adaptive rules that are easily implementable and thus suitable for real life implementations. The developed controller is tested in two important automotive control problems that are idle speed control (ISC) and fuel-to-air ratio (FAR) control. These two applications, ISC and FAR control, constitute the experimental part of this research. In ISC, the objective is to regulate the engine speed to a prescribed set-point in the presence of accessory load torque disturbances such as due to air conditioning and power steering. The adaptive controller, integrated with the existing proportional spark controller, is used to drive the electronic throttle actuator. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrating the performance improvement by employing the adaptive controller are presented. Modifications and improvements to the controller structure, which were developed during the course of experimentation to solve specific problems, are also presented. In addition, the potential for the reduction in calibration time and effort which can be achieved with our approach is discussed. (cont.) The objective in FAR control is to maintain the in-cylinder FAR at a prescribed set point, determined primarily by the state of the Three-Way Catalyst (TWC), so that the pollutants in the exhaust are removed with the highest efficiency. The FAR controller must also reject disturbances due to <b>canister</b> vapor <b>purge</b> and inaccuracies in air charge estimation and wall-wetting (WW) compensation. Two adaptive controller designs are considered. The first design is based on feedforward adaptation while the second design is based on both feedback and feedforward adaptation. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrating the performance improvement by employing the APC are presented. In addition, modifications and improvements to the APC structure, which were developed {{during the course of the}} experiments, to solve specific implementation problems are presented. by Yildiray Yildiz.
