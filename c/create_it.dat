5|$|As for the {{development}} of the parochial system, David's traditional role as its creator can not be sustained. Scotland already had an ancient system of parish churches dating to the Early Middle Ages, and the kind of system introduced by David's Normanising tendencies can more accurately be seen as mild refashioning, rather than creation; he made the Scottish system as a whole more like that of France and England, but he did not <b>create</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1911, a {{competition}} {{for the design of}} Canberra was launched, and Scrivener's detailed survey of the area was supplied to the competing architects. The Molonglo River flowed through the site, which was a flood plain and Scrivener's survey showed in grey an area clearly representing an artificial lake—similar to the lake later created—and four possible locations for a dam to <b>create</b> <b>it.</b> Most of the proposals took the hint and included artificial bodies of water.|$|E
5|$|Where sawgrass grows densely, few {{animals or}} other plants thrive, {{although}} alligators often choose these locations for nesting. Where {{there is more}} room, periphyton grows, appearing as mats or brown sausage-shaped chunks. Periphyton is predominantly algae, although over 100different microorganisms help <b>create</b> <b>it.</b> Larval insects and amphibians are supported by periphyton; these in turn provide food for birds, fish, and reptiles. Periphyton also absorbs calcium from the water, which creates marl where sawgrass takes root.|$|E

5|$|In 1894, Lemoine co-founded another {{mathematical}} journal entitled, L'intermédiaire des mathématiciens {{along with}} Charles Laisant, a friend {{whom he met}} at the École Polytechnique. Lemoine had been planning such a journal since early 1893, but thought {{that he would be}} too busy to <b>create</b> <b>it.</b> At a dinner with Laisant in March 1893, he suggested the idea of the journal. Laisant cajoled him to create the journal, and so they approached the publisher Gauthier-Villars, which published the first issue in January 1894. Lemoine served as the journal's first editor, and held the position for several years. The year after the journal's initial publication, he retired from mathematical research, but continued to support the subject. Lemoine died on 21 February 1912 in his home city of Paris.|$|E
5|$|The Society for Human Rights was an American LGBT Rights {{organization}} {{established in}} Chicago in 1924. Society founder Henry Gerber {{was inspired to}} <b>create</b> <b>it</b> by German Doctor Magnus Hirschfeld and his work with the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee. It was the first recognized gay rights organization in the United States, having received a charter {{from the state of}} Illinois, and produced the first American publication for homosexuals, Friendship and Freedom. A few months after being chartered, the group ceased to exist {{in the wake of the}} arrest of several of the Society's members. Despite its short existence and small size, the Society has been recognized as a precursor to the modern gay liberation movement.|$|E
5|$|The War Department envisaged {{that the}} Manhattan Project would be {{superseded}} by a statutory authority. Legislation to <b>create</b> <b>it</b> {{was drafted by}} two War Department lawyers, Kenneth C. Royall and William L. Marbury. Their draft bill ran into strong opposition, particularly from the influential Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg. On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative bill on atomic energy, which quickly {{became known as the}} McMahon bill. This was initially a very liberal bill towards the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson bill also provided for civilian control. Section 10 assigned the patent for any invention related to atomic energy to the commission.|$|E

5|$|The player {{begins the}} game as the latest recruit to TetraCorps mining {{franchise}} operation and is tasked with selling as much ore {{as possible to the}} Federation, which is a coalition of six of the seven known alien cultures: the Terrans, the Artemia, the Mikotaj, the Achean Gatherings, the Braccatia and the Rigellians. The Federation was inaugurated in 2439 following a coup deposing the last Terran Emperor Dramon Salaria in 2437 and was established to encourage commercial competition rather than full-scale wars between its constituent parties. The authority of the Federation is constantly challenged — in part by those who helped to <b>create</b> <b>it,</b> and the further away from the Federal center a person is, the less the Federation can influence their day-to-day lives. The seventh alien culture — the Mauna are not members of the Federation and it is revealed in the game that they are an untrustworthy and cruel species. It is not known if the Mauna were consulted with prior {{to the creation of the}} Federation, and trading with the Mauna is frowned upon by the Federation.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Ventus is the {{apprentice}} of Master Xehanort, who trains him to complete the legendary χ-blade. However, due to Ventus' reluctance to use darkness, Xehanort extracted it from his heart, resulting in the creation of Vanitas, but also leaving his heart incomplete and on the verge of collapse. Xehanort brings Ventus to Destiny Islands, where his heart merges with that of the newborn Sora to keep it safe. Having lost his memories, Ventus is placed in the care of Master Eraqus as his youngest Keyblade apprentice alongside Terra and Aqua. At the game's beginning, Vanitas taunts Ventus into following Terra who sets out to find Xehanort. Ventus travels through various worlds, fighting mysterious creatures called the Unversed and meeting various people. Vanitas attacks Ventus during his journey to test his strength, but he is defeated when Keyblade apprentice Mickey aids Ventus. Upon meeting Xehanort, Ventus is forced to remember his purpose as being used to create the χ-blade. Ventus refuses to battle Vanitas and <b>create</b> <b>it,</b> but is forced to after Vanitas threatens to kill Terra and Aqua if he does refuse. They battle within the Keyblade Graveyard, where Vanitas merges with Ventus and obtains the χ-blade. However, the fusion is incomplete, which allows Ventus to destroy Vanitas within his heart and Aqua to destroy the χ-blade. As a result, Ventus loses his heart and his body is placed within Castle Oblivion by Aqua until he awakens. Ventus' wandering heart is able to find its way back to the young Sora, who accepts Ventus' heart into his body. In the game's secret ending, he is seen in the Land of Departure with Terra, and the two utter Sora's name with newfound hope.|$|E
