5|$|It soon <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{name the}} new highway, and an {{upcoming}} visit by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth {{proved to be}} the focal point for a dedication ceremony. On June7, 1939, the two royal family members drove along the highway (which now connected to Niagara Falls) and passed through a light beam near the Henley Bridge in St. Catharines. This caused two Union Jacks to swing out, revealing a sign which read The Queen Elizabeth Way.|$|E
5|$|After Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a {{talk with}} Belushi about his antics, the {{production}} returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until it <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> shoot the final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} episode, both St-Pierre and Koscheck had Johnson {{at the top}} of their lists when it <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> select fighters. During the team {{selection}} process however, St-Pierre created a fake list which did not have Johnson among his top selections, and subtly showed it to Koscheck to fool him into believing it. This seemed to manipulate Koscheck into picking Marc Stevens, as he may have believed he could take Johnson later. This allowed St-Pierre to choose Johnson with the second overall pick.|$|E

5|$|The Simpsons shorts first {{appeared}} in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. Another family member, Grampa Simpson, {{was introduced in the}} later shorts. Years later, during the early seasons of The Simpsons, when it <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> give Grampa a first name, Groening says he refused to name him after his own grandfather, Abraham Groening, leaving it to other writers to choose a name. By coincidence, they chose Abraham, unaware that it was the name of Groening's grandfather.|$|E
5|$|When it <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{translate}} The Black Island, {{which is}} set in Great Britain, the opportunity was taken to make the scenes more true-to-life; such as ensuring that the British police were unarmed and ensuring scenes of the British countryside were more accurate for discerning British readers. Methuen had decided that the book did not portray Great Britain accurately enough, and had {{compiled a list of}} 131 errors of detail, which should be put right, asking Studios Hergé to rework it completely. The resulting album is the dramatically updated and redrawn 1966 version that is the most commonly available today. , Egmont publishes Tintin books in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|For Halloween II, Zombie {{decided to}} focus more on the {{connection}} between Laurie and Michael, and the idea they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. For the characters of Halloween II, it is about change. Zombie wanted to look at how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to show the connection between Laurie and Michael, and provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} shape for a ladle is a {{vertical}} cone, but other shapes are possible. Having a tapered cone as the shell adds strength and rigidity to the shell.

5|$|When it <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{kill off}} Ana Lucia, the {{character}} of Libby was killed {{at the same time}} to create an emotional impact. This happened amidst rumours that the characters were killed off because both actresses in question had been arrested for DUI while filming on location in Oahu. The producers denied that Ana Lucia was killed off because of Rodriguez's behaviour on set, saying although they had no interaction with her, they had been told she had been professional. Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where Lost is filmed; her allergies were hard to deal with, but she loved the scenery.|$|E
25|$|When it <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{close the}} {{remainder}} of the North Beach tramline, the Board decided to replace the trams with trolley buses. The second line, to Marshland Road via Richmond, opened on 17 December 1934.|$|E

A Bariba woman is expected to labor and birth alone at home, and when it <b>comes</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> deliver, she does so on her knees.

25|$|He {{continued}} to paint and make prints (as he would throughout his life), but, when it <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> declare his major, chose sculpture. He received his BFA in 1937. Although he had paintings and prints in several exhibitions, and was {{actively involved in}} Seattle's arts community, he didn't immediately focus on a career in art, as he was helping his uncles with the family business.|$|E
25|$|When it <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} further tramline closures in the mid-1930s, the Board {{decided to}} go with A.E.C. diesel buses as they felt the technology had matured {{to the point where}} they were a reliable option. Though the trolley buses introduced only a few years earlier had performed well and found favour with passengers, their dependence on fixed infrastructure did not suit the Board's preference for operational flexibility. The first order for ten chassis was placed with A.E.C. in 1935–1936.|$|E
25|$|To {{the extent}} that Italy held the {{territory}} by UN mandate, the trusteeship provisions gave the Somalis the opportunity to gain experience in political education and self-government. These were advantages that British Somaliland, {{which was to be}} incorporated into the new Somali state, did not have. Although in the 1950s British colonial officials attempted, through various administrative development efforts, to make up for past neglect, the protectorate stagnated. The disparity between the two territories in economic development and political experience would cause serious difficulties when it <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> integrate the two parts.|$|E

While attending recruit training Caddy received training on several weapons in use at the time including the Reising sub-machine gun, Browning automatic rifle, M-1 carbine, bayonet and the hand grenade. When it <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> qualify with the service rifle he fired a score of 305 qualifying him as a sharpshooter.|$|E
25|$|On {{a memorable}} evening in 1953, up and coming New York TV {{personality}} Steve Allen was a last-minute replacement for Godfrey on Talent Scouts. When it <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> deliver the live commercial for Lipton tea and soups, Allen impulsively prepared the soup and tea on camera, and poured both into a ukulele. Shaking the mixture well, {{he played a}} few damp notes while reciting {{the rest of the}} commercial. Allen became a national celebrity and within the year he would become the first host of NBC's Tonight Show.|$|E
25|$|When it <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> land on October 25, the North Koreans {{had already}} {{withdrawn}} and the British and South Koreans were securing the area. Ultimately the landing was not needed and MacArthur {{was criticized for}} not using the X Corps {{in the pursuit of}} the retreating North Korean Army on the Inchon front. On October 19, the South Korean Army captured Pyongyang so instead of heading there the American army went north along the coast to occupy Hungnam and the Chosin Reservoir areas while the 3rd Infantry Division landed at Wonsan in November as reinforcements.|$|E

25|$|Johnson's {{trial began}} in late March. With a {{predominantly}} Republican Senate, Johnson's impeachment seemed to many a foregone conclusion. However, throughout the process, several senators began showing hesitance {{to remove the}} President from office. Stanton, meanwhile, had remained barred in the War Department's headquarters for weeks, sneaking off {{once in a while}} to visit his home. When it seemed to Stanton that Johnson would not remove him forcefully from office, he began spending more time at home. Stanton watched closely as the trial, which he was convinced would end with Johnson's conviction, continued for several months. When it <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> vote, 35 voted to convict, 19 to acquit, falling one short of the 36-vote supermajority needed for a conviction. The remaining proceedings were delayed for several days for the Republican National Convention. On May 26, after Johnson had been acquitted on all of the ten other charges, Stanton submitted his resignation to the President.|$|E
