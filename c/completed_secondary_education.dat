5|$|Municipal {{elections}}, {{during which}} mayors are elected, take place every four years; they take place {{one year before}} presidential elections (since 2008) in the last Sunday of October. Candidates must comply a number of requisites in order {{to run for mayor}} of Pichilemu; those include: to have <b>completed</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> (Enseñanza Media), to be a citizen, literate, to have resided in the Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region {{for at least two years}} before the election, and to have their military status regularized. The mayor is usually sworn in on the 6 December following the election. The next election for the mayor will be in 2016. Municipal elections originally elected three mayors, called primer, segundo, and tercer alcalde, and a number of regidores. For example, the results of the first elections in Pichilemu, for the term between 1894 and 1897, showed José María Caro Martínez, Pedro Nolasco de Mira, and Francisco Reyes elected as the first primer, segundo, and tercer alcalde of Pichilemu, respectively. The role of the primer alcalde equals that of the current mayor of Pichilemu. However, voting was not popular: only taxpayers and landowners could vote. According to the Decree #5655 of 4 December 1945, regidores were popularly elected, and they had the faculty to vote for the mayor that would rule for the local government three-year term. The 1973 Chilean coup d'état interrupted Washington Saldías Fuentealba's mayoral term, hence terminating possibilities of new elections. The military regime of Augusto Pinochet appointed seven mayors, who held the office in a period of nineteen years. Following the Chilean transition to democracy, the D'Hondt method of proportional representation was used in the municipal elections of 1992, 1996, and 2000: all candidates run in a single list, the most voted candidate becomes the mayor and other five/six become councilors, according to the aforementioned method. For the municipal elections beginning in 2004, candidates for mayor and councilor run in separate lists, and mayors are elected by simple majority of votes.|$|E

According to the census men accounted for 1,219,000 persons, or 46.7%, and women for 1,393,000 persons, or 53.3%. Comparing the results with the previous census (1989) shows the trend of population ageing which, while prevalent throughout the country, is partly offset in Kiev by the inflow of working age migrants.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{estimates of}} the economic benefits of <b>completing</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> in Australia. The purpose of focusing on <b>secondary</b> school <b>education</b> is to highlight the importance of base level education {{in the production of}} human capital over life cycles of young men and young women. The distinctive feature {{of this study is that}} it attempts to calculate the option values generated by <b>completing</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> which are the opportunities for obtaining more advanced human capital skills through undertaking tertiary study programs. This study uses a modified Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989, 1992) lifetime labour income approach, which measures economic benefits of <b>completing</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> by additions to lifetime labour incomes due to additional schooling activities. Option values are calculated as differences between alternative lifetime labour incomes associated with the corresponding schooling choices upon <b>completing</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education.</b> The empirical results show that option values make up significant proportions of total returns to <b>secondary</b> <b>education,</b> ranging from 20 % to 30 % for men, and from 28 % to 44 % for women over the period 1986 – 2001. In particular, option values become increasingly prominent in recent years which have witnessed strong demand for more educated workers...|$|R

2500|$|Some prisons provide {{educational}} programs for inmates that can include basic literacy, secondary education, or even college education. Prisoners seek education {{for a variety}} of reasons, including the development of skills for after release, personal enrichment and curiosity, finding something to fill their time, or trying to please prison staff (which can often secure early release for good behavior). However, the educational needs of prisoners often come into conflict with the security concerns of prison staff and with a public that wants to be [...] "tough on crime" [...] (and thus supports denying prisoners access to education). Whatever their reasons for participating in {{educational programs}}, prison populations tend to have very low literacy rates and lack of basic mathematical skills, and many have not <b>completed</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education.</b> This lack of basic education severely limits their employment opportunities outside of prison, leading to high rates of recidivism, and research has shown that prison education can {{play a significant role in}} helping prisoners reorient their lives and become successful after reentry.|$|E
2500|$|According to the IPPR, the {{relatively}} low level of education amongst Somali migrants in the UK {{can be attributed to}} their migratory history and the situation in their country of origin. They note that, like many other refugee and migrant communities, early Somali migrants tend to be relatively well educated, but later arrivals, including family members of early migrants, are less well qualified. Labour migrants arriving prior to 1988 were generally literate in either English or Arabic, although few had <b>completed</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education.</b> Many of the initial wave of refugees from the Somali Civil War who started to arrive from 1988 onwards were well educated, with many possessing secondary education and some holding degrees. According to the IPPR, the educational profile of Somali migrants subsequently changed again, because {{of the impact of the}} civil war on education in Somalia. In the north, including Somaliland, the majority of schools in urban areas were destroyed, along with higher education institutions. In the south, [...] "education has been completely destroyed by the fighting". While some schools have been rebuilt and have reopened, the IPPR reports that [...] "younger Somalis who have come directly from Somalia will not have attended university and are likely to have had a very interrupted education or none at all".|$|E
