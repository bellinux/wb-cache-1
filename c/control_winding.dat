5000|$|The typical {{magnetic}} amplifier {{consists of two}} physically separate but similar transformer magnetic cores, {{each of which has}} two windings: a <b>control</b> <b>winding</b> and an AC winding. A small DC current from a low-impedance source is fed into the series-connected control windings. The AC windings may be connected either in series or in parallel, the configurations resulting in different types of mag amps. The amount of control current fed into the <b>control</b> <b>winding</b> sets the point in the AC winding waveform at which either core will saturate.

5000|$|In {{electronic}} circuits, transformers and inductors with ferromagnetic cores operate nonlinearly {{when the}} current through them {{is large enough to}} drive their core materials into saturation. This means that their inductance and other properties vary with changes in drive current. In linear circuits this is usually considered an unwanted departure from ideal behavior. When AC signals are applied, this nonlinearity can cause the generation of harmonics and intermodulation distortion. To prevent this, the level of signals applied to iron core inductors must be limited so they don't saturate. To lower its effects, an air gap is created in some kinds of transformer cores. [...] The saturation current, the current through the winding required to saturate the magnetic core, is given by manufacturers in the specifications for many inductors and transformers. [...] On the other hand, saturation is exploited in some electronic devices. Saturation is employed to limit current in saturable-core transformers, used in arc welding, and ferroresonant transformers which serve as voltage regulators. When the primary current exceeds a certain value, the core is pushed into its saturation region, limiting further increases in secondary current. In a more sophisticated application, saturable core inductors and magnetic amplifiers use a DC current through a separate winding to control an inductor's impedance. Varying the current in the <b>control</b> <b>winding</b> moves the operating point {{up and down in the}} saturation curve, controlling the AC current through the inductor. These are used in variable fluorescent light ballasts, and power control systems.|$|E

40|$|Intensive {{development}} {{in the field of}} high-temperature superconductors (HTS) has resulted in long length HTS with high current carrying capacity. The performance of HTS in the form of multifilamentary silver sheathed Bi- 2223 tapes is close to the requirements for power application. Several power apparatus prototypes based on HTS have been and are being demonstrated. Recently the first commercial order for a HTS power apparatus was placed. Tennessee Valley Authority ordered two 12 MVA synchronous condensers with HTS rotor windings for reactive power compensation. In most power devices the conductor is carrying an AC transport current while it is exposed to an AC magnetic field transverse to the current path. In certain applications such as multi-layer power transmission cables or the <b>control</b> <b>winding</b> in a controllable reactor, the conductors are exposed to a magnetic field component longitudinal to the tape axis that is parallel with the current path. In this thesis, the losses in HTS tapes in longitudinally applied magnetic field are investigated and a single phase small scale controllable reactor with a loss optimized HTS <b>control</b> <b>winding</b> is designed, constructed and tested. An experimental setup to measure the losses in tapes exposed to longitudinal magnetic fields, transport currents, frequencies, and temperatures is presented. The system is based on a calorimetric loss measuring method where the losses are determined by the temperature response of the conductor when exposed to magnetic field and/or carrying transport current. Semi-empirical loss models are developed from the results of the loss measurements of non-twisted multifilamentary Bi- 2223 tapes. The losses when the sample is carrying transport currents and is exposed to longitudinal magnetic fields are found to consist of hysteresis, flux flow, and eddy current losses. The hysteresis losses can be modeled with the critical state model. The flux flow losses can be described with a power law dependent current voltage characteristic. The loss models are well suited for the design of power devices in which HTS is exposed to longitudinal magnetic fields. Based on the knowledge of the losses a single phase small scale controllable reactor with a loss optimized HTS <b>control</b> <b>winding</b> is designed, constructed and tested. A simple model of the magnetic circuit of the controllable reactor is presented. Calculations from the model are compared with experimental measurements. The feasibility to design controllable shunt reactors with large linear dynamic range, low losses and limited harmonic distortion is demonstrated.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a programme of research encompassing the design, optimisation and experimental testing of a brushless doubly fed reluctance machine (BDFRM) {{for use as}} an aerospace electrical generator, specifically a direct line connected generator, to widen the input shaft speed beyond the normal constraints imposed by the 360 - 800 Hz specification for a variable-frequency AC aerospace network. BDFRMs offer the functionality of frequency correction, via a <b>control</b> <b>winding,</b> and {{have the advantage of}} using a robust reluctance rotor. A partially-rated <b>control</b> <b>winding</b> converter can, in principle, be used to provide the slip power required. A further advantage of the BDFRM is the inherent fail-safe nature of these machines, with the output voltage collapsing as soon as the <b>control</b> <b>winding</b> current has been removed. A synchronous reluctance machine was studied as a means of providing a baseline for the BDFRM performance, including a comparison of the effect of scaling on power density. A large number of time-stepped finite element simulations were undertaken to explore BDFRM performance, in particular, the influence of magnetic saturation in limiting the achievable power density and in compromising power quality. Detailed optimisation of a BDFRM was undertaken, including systematic mechanical design of the rotor for high speed operation. This analysis illustrates the significant compromises in machine electromagnetic performance which result from the need to accommodate mechanical stress. The scope for employing small amounts of permanent magnet material in the rotors of both synchronous reluctance machines and BDFRMs, to improve the machine performance {{at the lower end of}} the current density range, was investigated. Following detailed optimisation, a demonstrator machine was manufactured, which includes a skewed rotor.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel open-winding {{brushless}} doubly-fed reluctance generator (OW-BDFRG) with dual two-level converters {{in order to}} reduce the converter rating and switching frequency for large-scale wind turbine applications. The new converter topology is equivalent to a three-level converter directly connected to the <b>control</b> <b>winding</b> of typical BDFRG. The OW-BDFRG system with this topology structure requires lower converter rating and switching frequency, and has a more flexible control mode, better operation performance, and fault redundancy capability. For the OW-BDFRG, this paper also proposes a new control scheme combining direct power control (DPC) with sliding mode variable structure (SMVS) control to implement the power tracking. The voltage-vector switching table of DPC is redesigned according to the error signals of active and reactive powers of the power winding, as well as the sector location of <b>control</b> <b>winding</b> flux. The active and reactive powers of the OW-BDFRG can be directly decoupled and independently controlled by properly selecting the switching voltage vectors. The novelty of this paper lies in an OW-BDFRG topology driven by dual two-level converters to improve the system characteristics, and the use of SMVS control to improve the DPC accuracy and robustness to parameter variations. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed system is verified through simulation and experimental studies...|$|E
