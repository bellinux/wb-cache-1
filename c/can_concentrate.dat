5|$|Since American kestrels are carnivores, toxic {{chemical}} runoff ingested by their prey <b>can</b> <b>concentrate</b> {{at high levels}} in their blood. Wild kestrels are subject to immunomodulation, or an altered immune response, to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into the environment. When PBDEs accumulate in body tissues of kestrels, the T-cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency. As a result, kestrels that ingest PBDEs may not respond sufficiently to viruses or other invading microorganisms. In addition, certain PBDEs may suppress growth {{and development of the}} spleen and bursa in American kestrels.|$|E
5|$|To {{perform in}} vitro analysis, a protein must be {{purified}} {{away from other}} cellular components. This process usually begins with cell lysis, in which a cell's membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as a crude lysate. The resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation, which fractionates the various cellular components into fractions containing soluble proteins; membrane lipids and proteins; cellular organelles, and nucleic acids. Precipitation by a method known as salting out <b>can</b> <b>concentrate</b> the proteins from this lysate. Various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight, net charge and binding affinity. The level of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the desired protein's molecular weight and isoelectric point are known, by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features, or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity. Additionally, proteins can be isolated according their charge using electrofocusing.|$|E

This is organized along conventional lines for an application framework, but is based on the Portable Document Format (PDF) drawing model provided by Quartz. This allows creating custom drawing content using PostScript-like drawing commands, which also allows automatic printer support and so forth. Since the Cocoa framework manages all the clipping, scrolling, scaling and other chores of drawing graphics, the programmer is freed from implementing basic infrastructure and <b>can</b> <b>concentrate</b> on the unique aspects of an application's content.|$|E
25|$|A small {{investment}} fund can potentially yield a higher return because it <b>can</b> <b>concentrate</b> its investments {{in a small}} number of good opportunities without driving up the purchase price as they buy in, and later sell them without driving down the sale price as they sell off. Conversely, a large {{investment fund}} must spread its investments among so many securities that its results tend to track those of the market as a whole. As the size of the market controlled grows, the results will be closer to market average.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene {{hydration}} or brewing {{produces an}} ethanol–water mixture. For most industrial and fuel uses, the ethanol must be purified. Fractional distillation at atmospheric pressure <b>can</b> <b>concentrate</b> ethanol to 95.6% by weight (89.5 mole%). This mixture is an azeotrope with a boiling point of , and cannot be further purified by distillation. Addition of an entraining agent, such as benzene, cyclohexane, or heptane, allows a new ternary azeotrope comprising the ethanol, water, and the entraining agent to be formed. This lower-boiling ternary azeotrope is removed preferentially, leading to water-free ethanol.|$|E

25|$|Accretion disks {{are usually}} {{assumed to be}} {{threaded}} by the external magnetic fields present in the interstellar medium. These fields are typically weak (about few micro-Gauss), but they can get anchored to the matter in the disk, because of its high electrical conductivity, and carried inward toward the central star. This process <b>can</b> <b>concentrate</b> the magnetic flux around {{the centre of the}} disk giving rise to very strong magnetic fields. Formation of powerful astrophysical jets along the rotation axis of accretion disks requires a large scale poloidal magnetic field in the inner regions of the disk.|$|E

25|$|In {{a priori}} methods, {{preference}} information is first asked from the DM {{and then a}} solution best satisfying these preferences is found. In a posteriori methods, a representative set of Pareto optimal solutions is first found and then the DM must choose one of them. In interactive methods, the decision maker is allowed to iteratively search for the most preferred solution. In each iteration of the interactive method, the DM is shown Pareto optimal solution(s) and describes how the solution(s) could be improved. The information given by the decision maker is then taken into account while generating new Pareto optimal solution(s) for the DM to study in the next iteration. In this way, the DM learns about the feasibility of his/her wishes and <b>can</b> <b>concentrate</b> on solutions that are interesting to him/her. The DM may stop the search whenever he/she wants to. More information and examples of different methods in the four classes are given in the following sections.|$|E
25|$|Kelly {{stayed with}} de Gribaldy for 1977 and 1978. Then in 1978 Michel Pollentier was disqualified from the Tour de France after {{cheating}} a drugs test {{on the afternoon}} that he took the race lead. He left the team {{at the end of}} the season and started his own, with a new backer, Splendor. Both Maertens and Pollentier wanted Kelly. Pollentier and Splendor offered Kelly more and made him a team leader. But Splendor was new and logistic problems became obvious. The bikes were in poor state– enough that Splendor decided not to ride Paris–Roubaix– and the manager, Robert Lauwers, was replaced. Kelly rose above it and rode for himself. The writer Robin Magowan said: Some people can do business on the committee system; others find that life is only fun when you are running the show. In Kelly's case it was to mean working for the collection of underpaid has-beens that de Gribaldy habitually assembled. But a smaller, less pretentious team can have its advantages for a rider of Kelly's sort. When you don't have to compete for a team's loyalty you <b>can</b> <b>concentrate</b> on winning races, and that's exactly what Kelly proceeded to do.|$|E

500|$|Deserts contain {{substantial}} mineral resources, sometimes {{over their}} entire surface, giving them their characteristic colors. For example, the red of many sand deserts comes from laterite minerals. Geological processes {{in a desert}} climate <b>can</b> <b>concentrate</b> minerals into valuable deposits. Leaching by ground water can extract ore minerals and redeposit them, according to the water table, in concentrated form. Similarly, evaporation tends to concentrate minerals in desert lakes, creating dry lake beds or playas rich in minerals. Evaporation <b>can</b> <b>concentrate</b> minerals as a variety of evaporite deposits, including gypsum, sodium nitrate, sodium chloride and borates. Evaporites {{are found in the}} USA's Great Basin Desert, historically exploited by the [...] "20-mule teams" [...] pulling carts of borax from Death Valley to the nearest railway. A desert especially rich in mineral salts is the Atacama Desert, Chile, where sodium nitrate has been mined for explosives and fertilizer since around 1850. Other desert minerals are copper from Chile, Peru, and Iran, and iron and uranium in Australia. Many other metals, salts and commercially valuable types of rock such as pumice are extracted from deserts around the world.|$|E
500|$|Academic Leona W. Fisher {{wrote in}} Children's Literature Association Quarterly {{that the novel}} employs a seldom used yet ingenious {{literary}} technique: {{the story is told}} with [...] "the sustained internal monologue presented almost exclusively in the present tense". The mores of his society and the actions of adults are strained through Marty's mind concurrently with his emotional agony and ethical judgments. The dialogue of the other characters tempers but does not counteract the [...] "exclusivity of his linguistic point of view" [...] because Marty is the sole narrator. Shiloh has a [...] "compacted time-frame, bounded by the past-tense opening and closing". Fisher noted that because the novel's events are confined to several weeks in the summer, {{there is no need for}} a [...] "panoramic sweep" [...] of the actions. The reader <b>can</b> <b>concentrate</b> solely on Marty's ethical crisis. Conveying the mood of the novel is also mostly confined to Marty's thoughts and current action. Naylor uses the past-perfect verb [...] "had" [...] on several occasions to depict the tones of the scenes. This usage conveys turning-points in the story, transferring the reader from the [...] "immediate tension" [...] of the present to a growing cognizance.|$|E
500|$|The [...] is an eye genetic {{technique}} {{and one of}} the Three Great Dōjutsu that naturally occurs in members of the Ōtsutsuki clan and its descendants and the Hyuga clan. The Byakugan originated with Kaguya, with her son Hamura inheriting the dōjutsu before he and most of his clan took residence on the moon; only one branch of Hamura's clan remained behind and over many generations became the Hyuga clan. Unlike the Sharingan and Rinnegan which are gained through experience and time, the Byakugan manifest at the moment of the user's birth. While normally lavender-white, pupil-less eyes, Byakugan's activation causes the pupils to become more distinct while the veins near their temples bulge. The Byakugan gives the user a nearly 360-degree field of vision. The user <b>can</b> <b>concentrate</b> his or her chakra in the blind spot to achieve 360-degree awareness. They can see and focus on anything within a certain distance from themselves, the range of which can be extended through training. During Part I of the series, Neji Hyuga is limited to fifty meters; by Part II, he can see objects at least eight-hundred meters away.|$|E
