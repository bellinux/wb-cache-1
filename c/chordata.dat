5|$|Parasitic infestations, stings, and bites {{in humans}} {{are caused by}} several groups of organisms {{belonging}} to the following phyla: Annelida, Arthropoda, Bryozoa, <b>Chordata,</b> Cnidaria, Cyanobacteria, Echinodermata, Nemathelminthes, Platyhelminthes, and Protozoa.|$|E
5|$|Most protostome phyla {{outside the}} Lophotrochozoa {{are members of}} Ecdysozoa ("animals that molt"), which include Arthropoda, Nematoda and Priapulida. Most other bilaterian phyla are in the Deuterostomia, which include Echinodermata and <b>Chordata.</b> The Acoelomorpha, which are neither protostomes nor deuterostomes, are {{regarded}} as basal bilaterians.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of hagfish in the phylum <b>Chordata</b> is not settled. Phylogenetic research in 1998 and 1999 supported {{the idea that}} the hagfish and the lampreys form a natural group, the Cyclostomata, that is a sister group of the Gnathostomata.|$|E
25|$|QSER1 {{is highly}} conserved in most {{species of the}} clade <b>Chordata.</b> Orthologs {{have been found in}} primates, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish {{as far back as the}} coelacanth, which diverged 414.9 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the name}} <b>Chordata</b> is {{attributed}} to William Bateson (1885), it was already in prevalent use by 1880. Ernst Haeckel described a taxon comprising tunicates, cephalochordates, and vertebrates in 1866. Though he used the German vernacular form, it is allowed under the ICZN code because of its subsequent latinization.|$|E
25|$|Attempts to {{work out}} the {{evolutionary}} relationships of the chordates have produced several hypotheses. The current consensus is that chordates are monophyletic, meaning that the <b>Chordata</b> include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, which is itself a chordate, and that craniates' nearest relatives are tunicates.|$|E
25|$|All this {{suggests}} the deuterostomes and protostomes are separate, monophyletic lineages. The main phyla of deuterostomes are the Echinodermata and <b>Chordata.</b> The former are radially symmetric and exclusively marine, such as starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. The latter {{are dominated by}} the vertebrates, animals with backbones. These include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.|$|E
25|$|Hemichordata, which {{includes}} the acorn worms, has been presented as a fourth chordate subphylum, but it now is usually treated as a separate phylum. The Hemichordata, along with the Echinodermata ({{which includes}} starfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and crinoids), form the Ambulacraria, the sister taxon of the Chordates. The <b>Chordata</b> and Ambulacraria form the superphylum Deuterostomia, composed of the deuterostomes.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle {{divided the}} living world between animals and plants, {{and this was}} {{followed}} by Carl Linnaeus, in the first hierarchical classification. In Linnaeus's original scheme, the animals were one of three kingdoms, divided into the classes of Vermes, Insecta, Pisces, Amphibia, Aves, and Mammalia. Since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum, the <b>Chordata,</b> whereas the various other forms have been separated out.|$|E
25|$|Taxonomists place {{lampreys}} and hagfish in the subphylum Vertebrata of the phylum <b>Chordata,</b> {{which also}} includes the invertebrate subphyla Tunicata (sea-squirts) and the fish-like Cephalochordata (lancelets or Amphioxus). Recent molecular and morphological phylogenetic studies place lampreys and hagfish in the superclass Agnatha or Agnathostomata (both meaning without jaws). The other vertebrate superclass is Gnathostomata (jawed mouths) and includes the classes Chondrichthyes (sharks), Osteichthyes (bony fishes), Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia.|$|E
25|$|One {{challenge}} studying sleep {{evolution is}} that adequate sleep information is known only for two phyla of animals- <b>chordata</b> and arthropoda. With the available data, comparative {{studies have been}} used to determine how sleep might have evolved. One question that scientists try to answer through these studies is whether sleep evolved only once or multiple times. To understand this, they look at sleep patterns in different classes of animals whose evolutionary histories are fairly well-known and study their similarities and differences.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} Huxley's work was {{recognised}} and, on returning to England in 1850, {{he was elected}} a Fellow of the Royal Society. In the following year, {{at the age of}} twenty-six, he not only received the Royal Society Medal but was also elected to the Council. He met Joseph Dalton Hooker and John Tyndall, who remained his lifelong friends. The Admiralty retained him as a nominal assistant-surgeon, so he might work on the specimens he collected and the observations he made during the voyage of the Rattlesnake. He solved the problem of Appendicularia, whose place in the animal kingdom Johannes Peter MÃ¼ller had found himself wholly unable to assign. It and the Ascidians are both, as Huxley showed, tunicates, today regarded as a sister group to the vertebrates in the phylum <b>Chordata.</b> Other papers on the morphology of the cephalopods and on brachiopods and rotifers are also noteworthy. The Rattlesnakes official naturalist, John MacGillivray, did some work on botany, and proved surprisingly good at notating Australian aboriginal languages. He wrote up the voyage in the standard Victorian two volume format.|$|E
2500|$|Jawless fishes {{belong to}} the {{superclass}} Agnatha in the phylum <b>Chordata,</b> subphylum Vertebrata. Agnatha comes from the Greek, and means [...] "no jaws". It excludes all vertebrates with jaws, known as gnathostomes. Although a minor element of modern marine fauna, jawless fish were prominent among the early fish in the early Paleozoic. Two types of Early Cambrian animal apparently having fins, vertebrate musculature, and gills are known from the early Cambrian Maotianshan shales of China: Haikouichthys and Myllokunmingia. They have been tentatively assigned to Agnatha by Janvier. A third possible agnathid from the same region is Haikouella. A possible agnathid {{that has not been}} formally described was reported by Simonetti from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia.|$|E
2500|$|Consider a {{particular}} species, the red fox, Vulpes vulpes: its next rank, the genus Vulpes, comprises all the [...] "true" [...] foxes. Their closest relatives {{are in the}} immediately higher rank, the family Canidae, which includes dogs, wolves, jackals, and all foxes; the next higher rank, the order Carnivora, includes caniforms (mustelids, bears, seals, and all those mentioned above), and feliforms (cats, hyenas, mongooses, civets), plus other carnivorous mammals. As one group of the class Mammalia, {{all of the above}} are classified among those with backbones, in the <b>Chordata</b> phylum rank; and with them among all the animals, in the Animalia kingdom rank. Finally, all of the above will find their earliest relatives somewhere in their domain rank Eukarya.|$|E
2500|$|Mammalia is a {{class of}} animal within the Phylum <b>Chordata.</b> Mammal {{classification}} has been through several iterations since Carl Linnaeus initially defined the class. No classification system is universally accepted; McKenna & Bell (1997) and [...] Wilson & Reader (2005) provide useful recent compendiums. Many earlier ideas have been completely abandoned by Linnaeus and modern taxonomists, among these are the idea that bats are related to birds or that humans represent a group outside of other living things. Competing ideas about the relationships of mammal orders do persist and are currently in development. Most significantly in recent years, cladistic thinking {{has led to an}} effort to ensure that all taxonomic designations represent monophyletic groups. The field has also seen a recent surge in interest and modification due to the results of molecular phylogenetics.|$|E
2500|$|Conodonts resembled {{primitive}} jawless eels. They appeared 495 Ma {{and were}} wiped out 200 Ma. Initially they were known only from tooth-like microfossils called conodont elements. These [...] "teeth" [...] have been variously interpreted as filter-feeding apparatuses or as a [...] "grasping and crushing array". Conodonts ranged in length from a centimeter to the 40cm Promissum. Their large eyes had a lateral position, which makes a predatory role unlikely. The preserved musculature hints that some conodonts (Promissum at least) were efficient cruisers but incapable of bursts of speed. In 2012 researchers classify the conodonts in the phylum <b>Chordata</b> {{on the basis of}} their fins with fin rays, chevron-shaped muscles and notochord. Some researchers see them as vertebrates similar in appearance to modern hagfish and lampreys, though phylogenetic analysis suggests that they are more derived than either of these groups.|$|E
