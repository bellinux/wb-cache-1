40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{lubrication}} approximation theory (LAT) is used {{to provide}} numerical results for <b>calendering</b> <b>sheets</b> with a desired final thickness. The Herschel-Bulkley model of viscoplasticity is used, which reduces with appropriate modifications to the Bingham, the power-law and the Newtonian models. For a desired final sheet thickness, the results give the required thickness of the entering sheet {{as a function of}} the dimensionless power-law index (in the case of pseudoplasticity) and the dimensionless yield stress (in the case of viscoplasticity). The corresponding pressure-gradient and pressure distributions are also given. The integrated quantities of engineering interest are calculated. These include the maximum pressure, the roll-separating force, and the power input to the rolls. Both pseudoplasticity and viscoplasticity lead to thicker sheets than the Newtonian model for large entry thickness ratios, while they lead to thinner sheets for small entry thickness ratios. In the case of viscoplastic sheets, the interesting yielded/unyielded regions appear {{as a function of the}} dimensionless yield stress. All engineering quantities, given in a dimensionless form, increase substantially with the departure from the Newtonian values.

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the process and}} challenges of adding a new calender machine to AvCarb Material Solutions' pyrolytic graphite production plant. Before the machine {{could be used for}} mass production, several experiments needed to be conducted to better understand the capabilities of the machine. A process control procedure was designed to set up the machine to produce parts within specification. By using a one-factor-at-a-time approach, the process capability (Cpk) ofthe calender machine can be significantly improved. Additionally, the calender machine was used to investigate the significance of common defects on the uncalendered material. Experiments show that spots that are 3 millimeters or less, scratches, and certain ripples do not cause a destructive effect on the <b>calendered</b> sheet; therefore, <b>sheets</b> with these defects can be safely passed through the quality inspection stage. Foreign object debris causes bubbles, which are destructive effects, to appear on the <b>calendered</b> sheet; therefore, <b>sheets</b> with foreign object debris should not pass inspection. However, if the foreign object debris is physically removed from the <b>sheet</b> before <b>calendering,</b> the resulting <b>sheet</b> will not have any destructive defects. Thus, by not rejecting uncalendered sheets with certain defects, AvCarb can improve its process yield. Additionally, a thermal conductivity test apparatus was designed and used to determine that the calendered heat spreader is 70 % more thermally conductive than its uncalendered counterpart. by Ernest Knute Svenson.

Low-intensity TMP and high-intensity TMP with mechanical pre-treatment of chips {{were compared to}} ATMP (Mg+P), where development of fibres was enhanced using hydrogen peroxide and magnesium hydroxide. The main goal of the trial was to evaluate the potential of using ATMP process for production of SC (supercalendered) magazine paper. SC paper is especially demanding {{when it comes to}} the paper surface structure which is strongly influenced by the development of fibre properties. Improvement in individual fibre properties such as flexibility, fibre split index and fibre surface area index achieved using ATMP process was found to translate into decreased surface roughness and air permeability of <b>calendered</b> laboratory <b>sheets.</b> Both the refining process configuration and the addition of process chemicals were found to have significant impacts though the process configuration had major role.

40|$|The {{lubrication}} approximation theory (LAT) is used {{to provide}} numerical results for <b>calendering</b> a <b>sheet</b> from an infinite reservoir. The Herschel-Bulkley model of viscoplasticity is employed, which reduces with appropriate modifications to the Bingham, power-law, and Newtonian models. A dimensionless slip coefficient is introduced {{to account for the}} case of slip at the roll surfaces. The results give the final sheet thickness {{as a function of the}} dimensionless power-law index (in the case of pseudoplasticity), the Bingham number or the dimensionless yield stress calculated at the nip (in the case of viscoplasticity), and the dimensionless slip coefficient in both cases. Integrated quantities of engineering interest are also calculated. These include the maximum pressure, the roll-separating force, and the power input to the rolls. Decreasing the power-law index or increasing the dimensionless yield stress lead to excess sheet thickness over the thickness at the nip. All engineering quantities calculated in dimensionless form increase substantially with the departure from the Newtonian values. The presence of slip decreases pressure and the engineering quantities and increases the domain in all cases. Copyright © 2006 by ASME...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{have been}} undertaken {{for the process}} of <b>calendering</b> viscoplastic <b>sheets</b> with a finite thickness. The finite element method (FEM) is used to provide numerical results for a fixed entry thickness (known attachment point) under two-dimensional steady-state conditions. The Herschel-Bulkley-Papanastasiou model of viscoplasticity is used, which is valid for all ranges of deformation rates. Part of the solution is finding {{the shape of the}} free surfaces of the entering and exiting sheet. Yielded/unyielded regions are found a posteriori for a range of the dimensionless yield stress or Bingham number (Bn) from the Newtonian viscous fluid (Bn = 0) to a highly viscoplastic one (Bn = 1000). The 2 D FEM results show limited unyielded regions between the rolls, in disagreement with the lubrication approximation theory (LAT). which predicts erroneous extended unyielded regions. However, LAT is good at predicting the excess sheet thickness over the thickness at the nip (hence the detachment point), the pressure distribution and all engineering quantities of interest in calendering. For thick entering sheets, viscoplasticity (and also shear-thinning) leads to excess sheet thickness as the dimensionless Bingham number increases; it reduces the vortex size in the fluid bank, and gives virtually no swelling at the exit from the rolls. All engineering quantities, given in a dimensionless form, increase substantially with the departure from the Newtonian values. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{calendering}} {{and rolling}} processes {{are used in}} a wide variety of industries for the production of rolled sheets or films of specific thickness and final appearance. The acquired final sheet thickness depends mainly on the rheological properties of the material. Materials which have been used in the present study are foodstuff (such as mozzarella cheese and flour-water dough) used in food processing. These materials are rheologically viscoplastic, obeying the Herschel-Bulkley model. The results give the final sheet thickness and the torque as a function of the roll speed. Theoretical analysis based on the Lubrication Approximation Theory (LAT) shows that LAT is a good predictive tool for <b>calendering,</b> where the <b>sheet</b> thickness is very small compared with the roll size. However, in rolling where this is not true, LAT does not hold, and a 2 -D analysis is necessary. © 2007 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

50|$|The terms double-top, sandwich-top, and composite-top all {{refer to}} a {{relatively}} new way to construct the soundboard of a guitar, developed by Matthias Dammann in Germany in the late 1980s. Other luthiers such as Robert Ruck, Fritz Mueller, Jim Redgate, Michel Bruck, Boguslaw Teryks and Gernot Wagner have since adopted the method. A double top usually consists of a material called Nomex sandwiched by two thin sheets of tonewood. A flame resistant meta-aramid (a polymer used to make synthetic fiber) material, Nomex was originally designed by DuPont Chemical Co. in the 1960s as a lightweight material {{for use in the}} aviation industry. Luthiers use the honeycomb <b>sheet</b> (<b>calendered</b> paper) version of the product: the low mass, strength, and ease of shaping make it ideally suited for guitar soundboards. Though the construction of a double top significantly differs from the traditional soundboard, a double top guitar often looks just like a traditional guitar. A thin soundboard is often incorporated and used to obtain the most vibration and to allow for optimal sound.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Calendering is {{a process}} for {{producing}} plastic sheets of a desired final thickness and appearance. The thickness of the exiting <b>sheet</b> during a <b>calendering</b> operation is uniquely found by the lubrication approximation theory and the application of the Swift boundary conditions, which dictate that both the pressure and its axial derivative are zero at detachment. This cannot be used in a 2 D analysis of the process, where the detachment point is the anchor of a free surface, and hence a singular point where both the pressure and the stresses go through numerical oscillations. This difficulty can be circumvented by using the boundary element method (BEM), which uses as primary variables velocities and tractions, and thus avoids pressures and stresses. Then the detachment point is found as the point where the tangential traction becomes zero. Numerical tests undertaken here with the finite element method (FEM) show that the LAT results {{can be used as a}} good approximation for the detachment point, which is then fixed. Comparisons with 2 D BEM results show a good agreement for all flow field variables. However, the exact position of the detachment point in a 2 D FEM analysis is still elusive, since for viscous polymer melts the contact angle is not known and should be part of the solution. Some thoughts are given about how to tackle this still unresolved issue, based on double nodes with discontinuous velocities and pressures.

40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} three parts: Existing {{methods for}} characterisation of fibre crosssections have been improved, and new {{methods have been}} developed. These methods have then been applied to {{study the effects of}} wood characteristics and the pulping process on mechanical pulp fibres. Links have been established between fibre structure and paper properties such as surface smoothness and light scattering coefficient. New methods, based on SEM-images and image analysis, are described for providing cross-sectional fibre dimensions for large fibre populations, for wood tracheids (app. 60 000 tracheids in a wood trunk) and for processed pulp fibres (app. 1000 fibres per sample). The methods are suited e. g. for evaluation of changes in the fibre cross-sections from wood to the finished paper, or for mapping of fibre parameters within and between growth rings in a wood trunk. The treatment of data is discussed, showing how one may examine the changes in different groups of fibres (earlywood fibres, latewood fibres, split fibres) throughout a process. It is known from the literature that groundwood-based paper is superior to TMP-based paper with respect to printability. Fibres from SGW and PGW-pulp were found to be much more split in the longitudinal direction than TMP-fibres at comparable freeness. Intact groundwood fibres had thicker walls than intact TMP-fibres, but nevertheless super <b>calendered</b> hand <b>sheets</b> made from groundwood fibres were less roughened by moistening than were TMP-based sheets. Both for groundwood pulps and for TMPpulps, it was shown that reduced fibre wall thickness and increased fibre splitting was beneficial for improved surface smoothness and opacity. Latewood defibrate easier than earlywood during refining. In the case of grinding, there was no particular preference for earlywood or latewood to be defibrated. Reject refining of groundwood reject was, however, found to be very important for defibration of latewood-containing shives. Pulps made from a raw material with more compact fibres (high wall area to lumen area ratio) were found to defibrate easier, and contain less shives. It was found that refining tends to reduce wall thickness most on thickwalled parts of the fibre, thus causing a reduction of the wall thickness variation around the perimeter. Earlywood fibres were found to be preferentially split during refining. Most fibre splitting occurs during the primary stage, while the fibres are firmly attached to chips or fibre bundles. Latewood fibre wall thickness decreases considerably more than earlywood fibre wall thickness during refining. It seems that choosing an appropriate raw material is more effective than using excessive energy on reducing the wall thickness of thickwalled fibres. Earlywood fibres became more flattened during refining compared to latewood fibres, possibly due to repeated compressions and relaxations in the refiner. The energy consumption to a given freeness was found to be considerably larger for Scots Pine than for Norway Spruce. However, the fibre transverse dimensions did not differ much between Norway Spruce and Scots Pine. Pine pulps were far less developed than spruce pulps at similar energy level. A possible explanation for the large energy consumption may be that redistribution of extractives at the fibre surface could reduce friction in the refiner. This hypothesis should be further explored. The results in this study improve the knowledge of which fibre parameters that matter for surface smoothness and opacity of wood-containing publication paper. Further, this study elucidates how important fibre parameters such as wall thickness and fibre splitting are altered during a refining process. The results may be utilized to identify possible ways of modifying the TMP-process in order to produce paper with improved surface smoothness and opacity. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
