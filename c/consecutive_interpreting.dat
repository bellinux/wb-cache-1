40|$|Literature on {{interpreting}} discusses {{two main}} modes of conference <b>interpreting</b> (<b>consecutive</b> and simultaneous), but aptitude for interpreting {{seems to be}} understood as a single construct. Accordingly, admission tests typically do not include separate tests for <b>consecutive</b> and simultaneous <b>interpreting</b> aptitude. Rejšková (1999) set out to explore this issue, and concluded that <b>consecutive</b> and simultaneous <b>interpreting</b> tap different skills and warrant separate aptitude tests. In the present study, we report on a follow-up on the study by Rejšková. Six simultaneous interpreting exercises were administered to 80 conference interpreting students. The exercises included shadowing (repeating verbatim the source text), personalised cloze test (repeating verbatim the source text, but changing pre-specified segments), and four simultaneous interpreting exercises from a foreign language into the mother tongue. Performance on the simultaneous exercises is correlated with interim exam results, both consecutive and simultaneous, to determine whether the two interpreting modes show different relationship with the tests.

50|$|A sign {{language}} interpreter must accurately convey messages between two different languages. An interpreter {{is there for}} both deaf and hearing individuals. The act of interpreting occurs when a hearing person speaks, and an interpreter renders the speaker's meaning into {{sign language}}, or other forms used by the deaf party(ies). The interpreting also happens in reverse: when a deaf person signs, an interpreter renders the meaning expressed in the signs into the oral language for the hearing party, which is {{sometimes referred to as}} voice interpreting or voicing. This may be performed either as simultaneous or <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreting.</b> Skilled sign language interpreters will position themselves in a room or space that allows them to be seen by the deaf participants and heard clearly by hearing participants, as well as {{be in a position to}} hear and/or see the speaker or speakers clearly. In some circumstances, an interpreter may interpret from one language to another whether that is English to British Sign Language, English to American Sign Language, Spanish to English to American Sign Language and so on.|$|E

It is known that cognitive / non-cognitive loads become higher in such contexts, which would affect the occurrences of misunderstanding. The main aims of the study are twofold: i. to expand the analysis for the <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreting</b> process. ii. to use this practical data accompanied by cases to discuss them during the <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreting</b> classes as part of situated learning. Firstly, triggers of misunderstanding are noted, then cases, where possible, are given, followed by suggestions as to how would-be consecutive interpreters can cope with such misunderstanding. These are complemented by reactions to cases from class versus real settings about the mentioned types of misunderstanding. Thus, this descriptive paper proposes a tested constructivist approach to grow awareness and better cope with misunderstanding in sensitive settings for <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreting</b> classes...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{presents}} an experiment to investigate 1) whether judged fluency correlates with judged accuracy of <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreting</b> performance; and 2) {{whether and how}} judged fluency can be predicted {{on the basis of}} acoustic measures such as automatically calculated temporal measures of speech quality. In the experiment, ten raters judged six major quality measures related to accuracy and fluency of the <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreting</b> performance (in this study from Chinese into English) recorded from seven BA trainees and five MA trainees based on the same recorded source speech. Six consecutive interpretations per participants were recorded, two of which were analyzed acoustically by means of the speech analysis tool PRAAT. The pauses detected by PRAAT and the disfluencies transcribed and labeled manually were automatically counted by the text analysis computer program of AWK, based on which 12 acoustic measures of fluency were calculated. The results show that 1) there is a strong positive correlation between judged accuracy and judged fluency in consecutive interpreting; 2) there are strong correlations between judged fluency and objective acoustic measures of fluency in consecutive interpreting; and 3) effective speech rate appears to be the best predictor of judged fluency in <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreting.</b> The other important determinants of judged interpreting fluency are number of filled pauses, articulation rate, and mean length of pause.

40|$|The {{starting}} point for developing this toolkit {{was the lack of}} a practical handbook which can prepare and guide interpreter-trainers in training future generations of interpreters. The authors feel this missing link both from their experience as professional active interpreters and their role as interpreter-trainers. Being an experienced professional interpreter {{plays an important role in}} this scenario, but it does not automatically grant the interpreter expertise in, or even familiarity with, relevant pedagogy and processes in order to train students or assess their progress. The toolkit starts with an insight into the theoretical background of pedagogy in interpreting which presents a discussion on the main elements within the interpreter training program’s pedagogical framework. This discussion is linked to the importance for the novice-trainer to understand and be acquainted, not only with the content of the assigned course component, but also with the wider institutional setting and its pedagogical framework. However, the toolkit, above all, provides practical ideas and tools to guide the novice interpreter-trainer in approaching the teaching of course components in conference <b>interpreting</b> such as <b>consecutive</b> and simultaneous <b>interpreting.</b> Therefore, we accompany the introductory theoretical insight with practical recommendations on the teaching of <b>consecutive</b> and simultaneous <b>interpreting</b> within a hypothetical 1 -year program. The toolkit provides suggestions for training exercises which are useful at the different stages in the process of skill acquisition. It includes tools and suggestions which aid the interpreter-trainer to prepare and plan adequately for training sessions and addresses the aspects of teaching resources, adequate feedback and assessment methods. In the appendices we present examples of material used by interpreter-trainers. The guidance and suggestions in the toolkit are not meant for specific language-pairs since it is meant as a kit suitable for all novice interpreter-trainers, regardless of the language-pair they work with...|$|R

40|$|Interpreting is {{generally}} {{recognized as a}} particularly demanding language processing task for the cognitive system. Dependency distance, the linear distance between two syntactically related words in a sentence, is an index of sentence complexity and is also able to reflect the cognitive constraints during various tasks. In the current research, we examine the difference in dependency distance among three interpreting types, namely, simultaneous interpreting, <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreting</b> and read-out translated speech based on a treebank comprising these types of interpreting output texts with dependency annotation. Results show that different interpreting renditions yield different dependency distances, and <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreting</b> texts entail the smallest dependency distance other than those of simultaneous interpreting and read-out translated speech, suggesting that <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreting</b> bears heavier cognitive demands than simultaneous interpreting. The current research suggests {{for the first time}} that interpreting is an extremely demanding cognitive task that can further mediate the dependency distance of output sentences. Such findings may be due to the minimization of dependency distance under cognitive constraints...|$|E

40|$|This project {{examined}} {{the effectiveness of}} three specific interpreting practices to mitigate risks in interpreted police interviews and to reduce the potential for interpreting errors. Increasingly, interviewers rely on interpreters because they lack proficiency in the language spoken by the suspect. Yet {{little is known about}} ways that situational and relational factors within the control of the interviewer can be implemented to minimize risks or error. The present study addressed this gap in the literature by testing how real interpreters perform under different circumstances within the control of the interviewer. The key factors were the influence of (a) the presence of an interpreter (monolingual vs. <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreted</b> interview by trained interpreters vs. untrained bilinguals vs. monolingual intermediaries); (b) the position of the interpreter in the interview in relation to the interviewer and suspect (adjacent to or behind the interviewee); and (c) maintenance by the interpreter of rapport-building strategies used by the interviewer. A simulated interview tested the impact on interpreters’ performance of (a) their understanding of the interpreter’s role; (b) changes in interpreter placement; and (c) an information sheet on the importance of interviewer-interviewee rapport. A scripted interview containing typical interpreting challenges in propositional content, legal terminology, rapport-building strategies, manner of delivery, coordination of turn-taking and ethical protocols was performed by professional actors who role-played a police interviewer and a suspect with 99 English-Spanish untrained bilinguals and trained interpreters and 65 trained and untrained monolingual intermediary interview facilitators. The intermediaries served as a control group for the presence of a third party at an investigative interview. Participants completed a pre-experiment questionnaire about the interpreter’s role and their formal interpreting or facilitation training, and one half read a pilot-tested rapport-maintenance information sheet. In the simulated interview, all participants interpreted from both a triangular position and behind the suspect (changed mid-way through the interview). A post-experiment questionnaire for participants sought ratings of the suspect’s credibility. The performance of all participants was rated by the actors who were blind to their background. Interpretations were transcribed and objectively coded for accuracy on the interpreting challenges and interpreting competence. Rapport-maintenance was assessed verbally, paraverbally and nonverbally. Formally trained interpreters were more likely to understand and perceive their role as neutral and outperformed bilinguals on all measures of accuracy and competence. Interpreting training predicted fewer errors and omissions (d = - 1. 98), better maintenance of verbal rapport markers (d = 1. 56), and nonverbal communication, namely, pace (d = 1. 48), tone of voice (d = 1. 54), emotional variation (d = 1. 48), and facial expression (d = 0. 87). Together, interpreter training and understanding of the role accounted for 40 % of the observed differences in proficiency between trained interpreters and untrained bilinguals. Overall, the rapport maintenance information sheet did not assist trained interpreters or untrained bilinguals in replicating rapport-building strategies in either the triangular position or from behind the suspect. Finishing in the triangular position increased perceptions that the interaction between the police interviewer and suspect was positive but did not improve interpreting performance. Untrained bilinguals who reviewed the information sheet used the first person while interpreting significantly more than their counterparts who did not receive this information. Results support the need for universally available legal training for interpreters. To secure accurate reproduction of verbal and nonverbal communication and maintenance of rapport-building strategies practitioners are advised to use legally trained interpreters...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{empirical}} and interdisciplinary {{investigation into the}} consecutive conference interpreter’s (CCIr) role as intercultural mediator. It seeks {{to determine whether there}} is a case for intercultural mediation in conference interpreting despite the greater degree of cultural transparency that characterises discourse in conference interpreting situations (CISs) when compared with other settings such as community and/or court interpreting. It also proposes an account of the CCIr’s role as intercultural mediator as an alternative to other accounts of the interpreter’s role in the literature on conference interpreting because those accounts do not explain clearly the CCIr’s role or are in conflict with very well-established concepts and principles associated with translation/interpreting such as faithfulness, accuracy, neutrality or accessibility. The account of the CCIr’s role as intercultural mediator is derived from the principles of a theoretical framework that draws on the findings of the theory of sense (Seleskovitch and Lederer 1995) and Sperber and Wilson’s (1986; 1995) relevance theory of communication (RT). The account provides the basis for formulating a clearer definition of the concept of intercultural mediation in the context of <b>consecutive</b> conference <b>interpreting</b> (CCI). Analyses of two types of data underpin the investigation: data from authentic examples from interpreters’ actual performance and data from 295 responses to a worldwide survey of professional conference interpreters conducted by this researcher for use in this thesis. Results of both analyses confirm the case for intercultural mediation in CISs and the validity of the proposed account of the CCIr’s role as intercultural mediator though situationality has been found {{to play an important role}} in the extent to which intercultural mediation is needed. Results also shed light on CCIrs’ use of cultural mediation procedures and the role of interpreters’ professional status, experience and language direction on their ability/willingness to perform intercultural mediation.

In the experiment, ten raters judged six major quality measures of the accuracy and fluency of the interpreting output recorded from seven BA trainees and five MA trainees. The seventh quality measure expressed linguistic complexity as the number of clauses per AS-unit. The results show that the main effects of repetition and proficiency are both significant on accuracy and fluency, but the main effects are absent on linguistic complexity. Moreover, in terms of fluency BA trainees benefit significantly more from repetition than MA trainees. Accuracy improvement through repetition does not differ significantly between the two groups.

40|$|AbstractTwo {{studies of}} the General Direction for Education and Culture of the European Commission, one of 2008 and the other of 2011, {{recommend}} the use of subtitling both to encourage learning foreign languages and {{as a tool for}} formal learning of foreign languages. In this article we intend to illustrate the possibility of using subtitling for teaching professional interpretation from French into Romanian and from Romanian into French {{on the basis of their}} similarities. In subtitling and in interpreting, the meaning is rendered by the logical decoding of the linguistic and extralinguistic messages. Subtitling and interpreting are similar as far as the following are concerned: linguistic and extralinguistic competences involved, the semiotic systems, the types of constraints involved in decoding the message, a more active participation of the public, compared to the translation recipient. The article provides examples of the use of subtitling for all types of interpretation: sight translation, liaison <b>interpreting,</b> <b>consecutive</b> and simultaneous translation.

40|$|Using a {{footswitch}} system, the retest {{reliability of}} the temporal and distance parameters of gait was investigated within a session for 22 stroke patients in the early phase of rehabilitation. High to very high reliability was found for the temporal and distance parameters of gait, and the temporal symmetry index based on the difference in single-limb support duration between each leg (r = 0. 85 to 0. 98; intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) (2, 1) = 0. 82 to 0. 98). Significant {{differences were found between}} the two trials for velocity, stride length, and total double support (p <. 05). Despite the high reliability coefficients, 95 % confidence intervals, which take into account the random and systematic error, were wide for all parameters. These wide confidence intervals indicate that the use of two <b>consecutive</b> measurements for <b>interpreting</b> an individual patient's change would not be a sensitive method for monitoring progress or deterioration during rehabilitation. Strategies that may improve the clinical usefulness of temporal and distance gait measures in stroke rehabilitation are discussed.
