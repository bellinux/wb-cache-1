These compounds use a <b>chemical</b> <b>tracer</b> which is attracted to or concentrated by the activity which is being studied.

Gamma cameras and other similar detectors are highly efficient, and the tracer compounds are generally very effective at concentrating at the areas of interest, so the total amounts of radioactive material needed are very small.|$|E

50|$|To date, all {{screening}} procedures that examine football players for brain damage have been post mortem. In 2013, Gary Small and colleagues developed an in vivo <b>chemical</b> <b>tracer</b> that can detect tau protein {{build up in}} living players. Small and his team invented this new <b>chemical</b> <b>tracer,</b> 2-(1-{6-(2-F-18fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile, or FDDNP, {{that could be used}} in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans. This new tracer measures for tau protein and amyloid plaque accumulation in human brains; symptoms of repetitive brain trauma among other things. Although tracers have been developed to screen for the build-up of tau proteins in the human brain, FDDNP is the first PET tracer that can be used in vivo in human trials. FDDNP was originally developed in an effort to detect Alzheimer’s in elderly individuals, thus the article was published in the journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. However, because there are similarities between Alzheimer’s and the effects of chronic traumatic encephelopathy (CTE), FDDNP was used to study the extent of brain trauma in consenting, retired NFL players.|$|E

Under this contract we have incorporated <b>chemical</b> <b>tracers</b> into an existing ocean mixed-layer model to simulate the physical processes controlling the distribution and seasonal cycle of dissolved gases in the upper ocean. The broad background of concurrent chemical, physical, and biological measurements at Station ALOHA provides enough redundancy of ``ground truth`` to assess the model`s accuracy. Biological oxygen production estimated from modelled <b>chemical</b> <b>tracers</b> agrees with estimates based on measurement of carbon fluxes into the deep ocean and nitrate fluxes into the upper ocean during 1989 - 90 and 1992 - 93, verifying {{for the first time the}} utility of <b>chemical</b> <b>tracers</b> for determining biological fluxes in the ocean.

40|$|Surface water {{contamination}} by human faecal wastes {{is a widespread}} hazard for human health. Faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are {{the most widely used}} indicators to assess surface water quality but are less-human-specific and have the potential to survive longer and/or occur naturally in tropical areas. In this study, 13 wastewater chemicals (chloride, boron, orthosphophate, detergents as methylene blue active substances, cholesterol, cholestanol, coprostanol, diethylhexyl phthalate, caffeine, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, sucralose and saccharin) were investigated in order to evaluate tracers for human faecal and sewage contamination in tropical urban catchments. Surface water samples were collected at an hourly interval from sampling locations with distinct major land uses: high-density residential, low-density residential, commercial and industrial. Measured concentrations were analysed to investigate the association among indicators and tracers for each land-use category. Better correlations were found between different indicators and tracers in each land-use dataset than in the dataset for all land uses, which shows that land use is an important determinant of drain water quality. Data were further segregated based on the hourly FIB concentrations. There were better correlations between FIB and <b>chemical</b> <b>tracers</b> when FIB concentrations were higher. Therefore, sampling programs must be designed carefully to take the time of sampling and land use into account in order to effectively assess human faecal and sewage contamination in urban catchments. FIB is recommended as the first tier in assessment of surface water quality impairment and <b>chemical</b> <b>tracers</b> as the second tier.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{usefulness}} of stable isotopic composition (delta C- 13) along with other <b>chemical</b> <b>tracers</b> and air mass trajectory to identify the primary and secondary sources of carbonaceous aerosols. Aerosol samples (n = 84) were collected continuously from April 2003 to April 2004 at Gosan site in Jeju Island, South Korea. The concentrations of total carbon (TC), HCl fumed carbonate-free total carbon (fumed-TC) and their delta C- 13 were measured online using elemental analyzer interfaced to isotope ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS). Similar concentrations of TC and fumed-TC and their similar delta C- 13 values suggest the insignificant contribution of inorganic carbon to Gosan aerosols. The monthly averaged delta C- 13 (TC) showed the lowest in April/May (- 24. 2 to 24. 4 parts per thousand), which is related with the highest concentrations of oxalic acid (a secondary tracer). The result indicates an enhanced contribution of TC from secondary sources. The monthly averaged delta C- 13 (TC) in July/August (- 23. 0 to 22. 5 parts per thousand) {{were similar to those}} in January/February (- 23. 1 parts per thousand to 22. 7 parts per thousand). However, <b>chemical</b> <b>tracers</b> and air mass transport pattern suggest that the pollution source regions in January/February are completely different from those in July/August Higher delta C- 13 values in July/August are aligned with higher concentration ratios of marine tracers (azelaic acid/TC and methanesulfonate/TC), suggesting an enhanced contribution of marine organic matter to the aerosol loading. Higher delta C- 13 values in January/February are associated with higher concentrations of phthalic acid and K+/TC, indicating more contributions of carbonaceous aerosols from fossil fuel and C- 4 -plant biomass combustion. This study demonstrates that delta C- 13 (TG) along with other <b>chemical</b> <b>tracers</b> and air mass trajectory, {{can be used as a}} tracer to understand the importance of primary versus secondary pollution sources of carbonaceous aerosols in the atmosphere.
