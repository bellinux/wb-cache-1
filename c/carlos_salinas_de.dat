Moro and Zorrilla were sentenced to 25 and 35 years in prison respectively, but were released from prison in February 2009 for good conduct after serving {{at least half of}} their sentences. Several public intellectuals, journalists, press freedom organizations, newspapers, and politicians protested their releases. Zorrilla returned to prison later that year after he failed to provide a formal letter petitioning his release. On 10 September 2013, Zorrilla was released from prison after a Mexico City judge granted him the opportunity to fulfill the remaining years of his sentence at his residence due to unstable health conditions. The Mexican government closed the case after the arrests, but many journalists doubted the results of the investigation and believed that the masterminds behind the murder case remained at large.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, the nuevo peso (new peso) was {{the result}} of {{hyperinflation}} in Mexico. In 1993, President <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> Gortari stripped three zeros from the peso, creating a parity of $1 New Peso for $1000 of the old ones.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> {{was born}} 3 April 1948, the second son {{and one of}} five {{children}} of economist and government official Raúl Salinas Lozano and Margarita <b>de</b> Gortari <b>de</b> <b>Salinas.</b> Salinas's father served as President Adolfo López Mateos's minister of industry and commerce, but was passed over as the PRI's presidential candidate in favor of Gustavo Díaz Ordaz (1964–70).

25|$|In the 1980s {{the first}} cracks emerged in PRI's monopolistic position. In Baja California, Ernesto Ruffo Appel was elected as governor. In 1988, alleged electoral fraud {{prevented}} the leftist candidate Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas from winning the national presidential elections, giving <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> Gortari {{the presidency and}} leading to massive protests in Mexico City.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} reforms of President <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> Gortari {{had a tremendous}} effect on the city, {{as a number of}} businesses, including banks and airlines, were privatized. He also signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This led to decentralization and a shift in Mexico City's economic base, from manufacturing to services, as most factories moved away to either the State of Mexico, or more commonly to the northern border. By contrast, corporate office buildings set their base in the city.|$|E
25|$|DN1: Preparation of the {{military}} forces to repel external aggressions. No military armed force can leave Mexican territory without a declaration of war, and approval of the Congress. The last time this was invoked was in 1942, to send an expeditionary force to the Philippines, after war was declared against Germany and Japan, following the sinking of two Mexican ships by U-boats. In 1990, President <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> Gortari asked {{the permission of the}} Congress to send troops to the Gulf War, but it was refused, since there was no declaration of war against Iraq.|$|E

The report, titled [...] "Raul Salinas, Citibank and Alleged Money Laundering," [...] indicated that Citibank facilitated the transfer of millions of dollars through complex financial transactions that hid the funds' paper trail. The report indicated that Citibank took on Salinas as a client without making a thorough inquiry as to how he made his fortune, an omission that a Citibank official called a violation of the bank's [...] "know your customer" [...] policy.|$|R

25|$|Velázquez {{was also}} a {{faithful}} supporter of the technocrat current within the PRI, which sought to dismantle the nationalist economic policies of the Mexican Revolution in order to open México to foreign investment. Velázquez supported technocrat Presidents Miguel de la Madrid, <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> Gortari, and Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon as they privatized state-owned enterprises (formerly a bastion of power for the CTM) {{as part of the}} structural adjustment plans imposed by the International Monetary Fund. During those years the minimum wage in real terms fell by nearly 70 percent. Velázquez also supported passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 after initially denouncing it as a disaster for workers of all three countries.|$|E
25|$|Canada's Brian Mulroney {{not only}} ran {{on a similar}} {{platform}} but also favored closer trade ties with the United States. This led to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement in January 1989. Mexican presidents Miguel de la Madrid, in the early 1980s and <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> Gortari in the late 1980s, started implementing liberal economic strategies that were seen as a good move. However, Mexico experienced a strong economic recession in 1982 and the Mexican peso suffered a devaluation. In the United States president Ronald Reagan attempted to move the United States back towards a hard anti-communist line in foreign affairs, in what his supporters saw {{as an attempt to}} assert moral leadership (compared to the Soviet Union) in the world community. Domestically, Reagan attempted to bring in a package of privatization and regulation to stimulate the economy.|$|E
25|$|He {{became a}} member of the Democratic {{leadership}} as a deputy majority whip, where he became friends with Bill Clinton after they worked closely on several issues, including when he served as the ranking House Democrat in favor of NAFTA's passage in 1993. For his work as a back channel to <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> Gortari, Mexico's president at the time of the negotiations, he was awarded the Aztec Eagle Award, Mexico's highest award for a foreigner. Clinton in turn sent Richardson on various foreign policy missions, including a trip in 1996 in which Richardson traveled to Baghdad with Peter Bourne and engaged in lengthy one-on-one negotiations with Saddam Hussein to secure the release of two American aerospace workers who had been captured by the Iraqis after wandering over the Kuwaiti border. Richardson also visited Nicaragua, Guatemala, Cuba, Peru, India, North Korea, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Sudan to represent U.S. interests and met with Slobodan Milošević. In 1996 he played a major role in securing the release of American Evan Hunziker from North Korean custody and for securing a pardon for Eliadah McCord, an American convicted and imprisoned in Bangladesh. Due to these missions, Richardson was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times.|$|E

A state of emergency was declared in at least ten states in Mexico following Calvin's passage. Furthermore, Mexican officials implemented emergency measures with assistance of agencies such as the Mexican Army and the local health department in the most of the devastated areas. Civil protection authorities donated food to more than 40,000people for three days. They distributed around 11,000blankets, 5,000mattresses, 8,000sacks of sand to reinforce dikes, and an additional [...] of food, medicine, and clothes. Many Los Angeles residents looked for ways to donate aid to the needy. Then-Mexican President <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> Gortari announced that the government would channel $11.4million to three of the hardest-hit states.
