50|$|Impact F-2: Presence of the {{overhead}} transmission line would increase {{the probability of a}} wildfire (Class I)- The presence of {{the overhead}} transmission line would create an ongoing source of potential wildfire ignitions {{for the life of the}} project. Line faults can be caused by such unpredictable events as <b>conductor</b> <b>contact</b> by floating debris, gunshots, and helicopter collisions; these events are rare but would be unavoidable. Impact F-2 is considered a significant impact because certain ignition sources are unavoidable. Due to the potential for unavoidable ignitions related to the presence of the {{overhead transmission line}} to occur during extreme fire weather, the presence of the project would significantly increase the likelihood of a catastrophic wildfire (Class I). The risk of ignitions and the risk of damage from a project-related ignition can be reduced, though not to a level that is less than significant.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an improved method of modeling contact current {{distribution in the}} quasi-static and full-wave surface integral equation solver FastImp [1]. A significant shortcoming of FastImp is its lack of a single uniform approach to model contact current across different frequencies. Its method of computing contact current at high frequencies does not efficiently and optimally capture skin and proximity effects. Its method of computing contact current at low frequencies lacks accuracy due {{to the use of}} a centroid collocation scheme when evaluating fields on the contact surfaces. The method discussed in this thesis offers a unified, more accurate and more efficient method of computing contact current over a wide range of frequencies. It is shown in this thesis that the electric field on the <b>conductor</b> <b>contact</b> surfaces can be modeled effectively by only a few conduction modes as basis functions. These conduction modes were first introduced in [2] for a "volume " integral equation solver.

40|$|As {{integrated}} circuits operate at increasingly higher speed, methods {{are needed to}} handle wideband quasi-static and full wave EM analysis of distributed RLC impedances for package and on-chip interconnects. One particular solver {{that is capable of}} this type of analysis is a surface-based integral solver called FastImp. This talk will present a method that addresses many issues currently plaguing FastImp. A significant shortcoming of FastImp is its lack of a single uniform approach to model contact current over a wide range of frequencies. In addition, FastImp's handling of contact current at high frequencies cannot optimally and efficiently capture skin effects and proximity effects while its handling of contact current at low frequencies lacks accuracy due to its use of a centroid-collocation scheme. The method discussed in this talk addresses the above difficulties by offering a unified mean of computing contact current over a wide range of frequencies. It will be shown that the electric field on the <b>conductor</b> <b>contact</b> surfaces can be modeled accurately and efficiently by only a few “partitioned” surface-based conduction modes as basis functions. The electric field on the non-contact surface of the conductor is modeled by a set of standard piecewise constant basis functions. The conduction mode basis functions, used in a Galerkin technique, and the piecewise constant basis functions, used in a collocation scheme, are utilized for the discretization of the integral formulation in FastImp. Examples will demonstrate the improvements on accuracy, efficiency and consistency of our method. Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{report on}} {{electron}} transport studies on superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures of indium and n-type lead telluride, {{either in the}} form of quantum wells or bulk crystals. In-PbTe contacts form by spontaneous alloying, which occurs already at room temperature. The alloyed phase penetrates deeply into PbTe and forms metallic contacts even in the presence of depletion layers at the semiconductor surface. Although the detailed structure of this phase is unknown, we observe that it exhibits a superconducting transition at temperatures below 10 K. This causes such substantial reduction of the contact resistances that they even become comparable to those predicted for ideal superconductor-normal <b>conductor</b> <b>contacts.</b> Most importantly, this result indicates that the interface phase in the superconducting state becomes nearly homogeneous - in contrast to the structure expected for alloyed contacts. We suggest that the unusual interface superconductivity is linked to the unique properties of PbTe, namely, its huge static dielectric constant. Apparently the alloyed interface phase contains superconducting precipitates randomly distributed within the depletion layers, and their Coulomb charging energies are extremely small. According to the existing models of the granular superconductivity, even very weak Josephson coupling between the neighboring precipitates gives rise to the formation of a global superconducting phase which explains our observations.
