5000|$|Based on the {{requirement}} to respond to specific standing tasks assigned to the CAF by the Government of Canada, such as respond to a terrorist attack, an international crisis or a <b>CBRN</b> <b>threat,</b> CANSOFCOM has developed several standing Special Operations Task Forces:• Immediate Response Task Force (IRTF). The IRTF is the highest readiness task force available to the Government of Canada; it is deployed on extremely short notice to address issues that could affect national interests. It is composed of personnel from all CANSOFCOM units and is led by JTF 2. Its primary focus is counter-terrorism operations, domestic or international. o Tasks include, {{but are not limited}} to: Hostage rescue, direct action, CBRN response, sensitive site exploitation, counter-proliferation, maritime special operations. • Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Task Force. This Task Force is based on the personnel and capabilities of CJIRU and includes the CANSOFCOM contribution to Canada’s National CBRNE Response Team, led by the RCMP. The CBRN Task Force provides a short notice response to crisis or major events within Canada and is primarily focused on counter-terrorism that involves Chemical, Biological, Radiological and/or Nuclear elements. It provides technical response to CBRN incidents and can be enabled by the capabilities of other CANSOFCOM units as required. At the request of the Government of Canada, the CBRN Task Force can also conduct counter-proliferation operations and be deployed internationally. o Tasks include, but are not limited to: Reconnaissance, surveillance, sampling, limited decontamination for Task Force personnel and sensitive site exploitation. • Task Force Arrowhead. TF Arrowhead is a scaleable, agile force able to respond to threats and incidents around the globe on short notice. While it is internationally focused, it can also be deployed in Canada. It is a high readiness SOTF capable of quickly deploying to a crisis for short periods of time. It is composed of personnel from all four units in the Command and is led by CSOR. TF Arrowhead represents an initial response that could be a pre-cursor to the deployment of another SOTF or conventional task force. o Tasks include, but are not limited to: Direct action, CBRN response, sensitive site exploitation, counter-proliferation, support to non-combatant evacuation operations, special protection operations. • SOF Teams. Small teams of CANSOFCOM personnel perform tasks that fall outside the scope of the three standing task forces. SOF teams generally deploy for short periods of time, typically not longer than six months. SOF teams are made up of personnel and capabilities from all four units. o Tasks include, but are not limited to: Defence, diplomacy and military assistance, strategic advice, planning and liaison, strategic reconnaissance and security support to operations of other Government of Canada organizations.|$|E
40|$|Based on zero-inflated {{negative}} binomial regressions {{applied to}} the Monterey {{weapons of mass destruction}} data, this article assesses the future risks from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) terrorism. Once the threshold for CBRN attacks is surpassed, further attacks arise: the expected number of CBRN incidents is over one and a half times higher than past events. Religious cults and groups with a transnational orientation pose the largest <b>CBRN</b> <b>threat</b> to society. Other things constant, nationalists ⁄ separatists and religious fundamentalists are not more apt to engage in CBRN terrorism than compared to ‘‘other groups. ’ ’ Democratic and corrupt regimes are the likely venues for CBRN incidents. Based on past incidents, rich countries are especially vulnerable to CBRN terrorism. Thus, recent actions by the U. S. Department of Homeland Security to put more resources into guarding against CBRN attacks appear sound. This study indicates that nonfundamentalist terrorists also present CBRN risks to democracies.

40|$|Fortunately, the <b>CBRN</b> <b>threat</b> {{is only a}} minor {{segment of}} the {{spectrum}} of challenges that Defense and Security organizations {{have to be prepared}} for. Although not neglected, CBRN is not high on political agendas. This means that maintaining adequate CBRN defense, as well as the research needed to enable it, acquire only relatively moderate financial resources. Unfortunately, the nature of the <b>CBRN</b> <b>threat</b> is highly dynamic and extremely difficult to predict. Therefore, existing preventive and protective solutions not necessarily cope with the actual threat. This, however, puts severe pressure on scarce research funding. The contradistinction between moderate political attention {{on the one hand and}} an urgent need for adaptive solutions on the other, inspire nations to seek international collaboration as a cost-sharing mechanism. This is neither new nor specific for CBRN. Many, even ancient, memoranda of understanding have been the formal basis of excellent scientific collaborative achievements. The presentation will provide some examples of hi- and trilateral CBRN research projects. The main driving force thus far has been to create a multiplier for existing research efforts. Another, more innovative, approach for international research collaboration, would be based on mutual willingness and preparedness to allow a certain level of interdependence between participating nations. The foundation would be to come to an agreement on defining, building and maintaining a shared knowledge base on a domain of common interest. That knowledge base would consist of competences and resources of research institutes of both nations. Those competences could have common grounds, but would rather be complementary in order to broaden the overall pool. That knowledge base should be readily accessible for both defense organizations and should be mutually guaranteed for an agreed upon term. In 2015, the Ministers of Defense of the Netherlands and Norway have signed an agreement to come to a Strategic Mutual Assistance in Research & Technology (SMART). As a first domain to discover the feasibility of SMART, they have tasked their national defense research establishments, TNO and FFI, respectively, to build a mutually shared knowledge base on CBRN. For that purpose, TNO and FFI have compared their CBRN portfolios, made a long term plan to achieve a shared knowledge base and have started research projects to fill it. The presentation will explain the SMART concept in more depth and will share the earliest experiences...|$|E

40|$|Evidence in the {{disaster}} mental health literature indicates that psychosocial consequences of terror-ism are {{a critical component}} of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) events, both at the clinical level and the normal behavioral and emotional levels. Planning for such psychosocial aspects should {{be an integral part of}} emergency preparedness. As Canada and other countries build the capacity to prevent, mitigate, and manage CBRN threats and events, it is important to recognize the range of social, psychological, emotional, spiritual, behavioral, and cognitive factors that may affect victims and their families, communities, children, the elderly, responders, decision makers, and others at all phases of terrorism, from threat to post-impact recovery. A structured process to assist CBRN emergency planners, decision makers, and responders in identifying psychosocial risks, vulnerable populations, resources, and interventions at various phases of a CBRN event to limit negative psychosocial impacts and promote resilience and adaptive responses is the essence of our psychosocial risk assessment and management (P-RAM) framework.

40|$|The SARS {{outbreak}} {{during the}} spring of 2003 showed that any new cases can trigger rapid community and non-social cluster transmission of SARS-CoV. This created substantial health, social and economic consequences. Improved outbreak management requires that identification of such diseases must trigger an immediate public health response. Rapid detection and management of infectious diseases such as SARS and their contacts together with the prompt implementation of the appropriate control measures can arrest and contain the transmission and spread of disease. Given the likelihood and observed frequency of outbreaks of infectious diseases, {{there is a need to}} be able to detect, manage and control the disease transmission as early as possible and thus minimise the impact of the outbreaks. Effective public health surveillance can act as an early warning system by detecting microbial, environmental, behavioural, occupational, and other health threats. It can also concentrate resources, focus interventions and facilitate planning. The issues and technological solutions for infectious disease management are also applicable to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (<b>CBRN)</b> <b>threat</b> domains as these all share many common factors. This paper aims to discuss the use of and need for visualising the network of interconnected information for situation awareness to assist in taking effective control measures during infectious disease outbreaks...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{international}} security context, the Prevention and mitigation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) hazards {{has become an}} important area of activities. EU is contributing to {{the international}} community effort to mitigate the threat and risks associated with these materials. The EU CBRN Action Plan (AP) was adopted in December 2009. The AP aims to strengthen CBRN security throughout the EU. Based on an all-hazard approach, the AP's overall goal is to reduce the threat of, and damage from CBRN incidents of accidental, natural and intentional origin, including terrorist acts. The AP contributes to the implementation of the EU Counter Terrorism Strategy and provides for three main areas of CBRN security work: Prevention, Detection, Preparedness and response. A total of 124 actions are to be implemented by the EU Member States and the EU Institutions. In addition to 25 actions relating to radiological and nuclear security, there are 32 actions covering biological or chemical security. A further 67 actions are horizontal actions {{in the sense that they}} apply to more than one area. The implementation of the Action Plan is guided by consultation with national authorities and other relevant stakeholders. The IAEA, Interpol, and Europol are closely associated to the implementation of the Action Plan. Outside EU border, the Instrument for Stability in its Indicative Programme 2009 - 2011 identifies “capacity building against CBRN threats” as a necessary condition for risk mitigation and preparedness. Effective response to CBRN risk depends on cooperation and co-ordination between all levels of government, response organizations and international partners. An effective strategy to deal with the <b>CBRN</b> <b>threat</b> requires a very high level of co-operation and co-ordination among many different authorities within and among countries. Therefore, the EU launched in 2010 the 'EU CBRN risk mitigation – Centres of Excellence initiative'. The overall scope of the initiative is hence to strengthen the long-term national and regional capabilities of responsible authorities and administrative infrastructures, and develop a durable cooperation legacy in the fight against the <b>CBRN</b> <b>threat.</b> JRC is supporting the EC DG DEVCO in the technical implementation of the CBRN CoE initiative through activities such as the analysis of CBRN needs and project proposals of partner country/region, Preparation of terms of references for selected projects, follow-up and quality control of projects, management of the IT tools (website, databases); as well as communication and coordination between all stakeholders. The JRC has long-standing experience and expertise in the field of nuclear security and safeguards in support to EURATOM, the IAEA and to implementation of EU projects under TACIS (Technical Assistance to Commonwealth of Independent States), Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation and Instrument for Stability. It was logical that JRC have been attributed several RN actions of the EU CBRN AP and also the technical implementation of the CBRN CoE Initiative. In this paper, we will highlight some of the activities of JRC in support to the implementation of the EU CBRN AP as well as the role and activities of JRC under the CBRN CoE initiative. JRC.
