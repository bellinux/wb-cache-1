In order to ensure mining safety at the <b>coal</b> <b>face,</b> it is of great significance to find out distribution condition of hidden trouble of water gushing from the <b>coal</b> <b>face</b> in advance, and then take effective prevention and control measures. This article introduces principles, methods, technologies and application effects of several electromagnetic methods for detection of hidden trouble of water gushing at <b>coal</b> <b>face,</b> and lays emphasis on expounding method principles and effects of down-hole detections by electric transmission tomography and transient electromagnetic method. It is shown {{by the results of}} actual measurement that the mine electromagnetic method is sensitive to water-bearing low-resistivity body and can play a unique role in detecting hidden trouble of water gushing at <b>coal</b> <b>face...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs for {{coal seam}} feature, {{geological}} structure and mining face stress concentration, the thin coal zone in island <b>coal</b> <b>face</b> with potential outburst {{is liable to}} induce dynamic disaster, such as coal and gas outburst, rockburst. It can improve the safety level and resource recovery ratio to research the outburst control technology of thin coal zone in island <b>coal</b> <b>face.</b> 11061 mining face of Liangbei mine is an island <b>coal</b> <b>face,</b> and the <b>coal</b> seam has outburst danger. When 11061 <b>coal</b> <b>face</b> exposed the thin coal zone unexpectedly, the strata behaviours were so serious that the <b>coal</b> <b>face</b> was forced to stop mining. Based on the distribution characteristics and stress regularity of the thin coal zone, the comprehensive outburst prevention and control technology which consists of pressure-releasing drill, loosening blast, discharging drill and effect check has been found and used in the thin coal zone. The results has proved that the comprehensive outburst prevention and control technology is effective to remove the outburst danger of the thin coal zone in 11061 mining face, and the comprehensive technology can help to mine 11061 <b>coal</b> <b>face</b> continuously {{in spite of the}} thin coal zone, which has brought successful engineering experience and distinct economic benefit...|$|R

Base on the {{geological}} conditions of instable and soft thin-seam with hard roof in Caoyao Coal Mine of Yima Coal Group, China, and combined with related parameters of strata behaviors at <b>coal</b> <b>faces,</b> the paper concludes that the strata control on the thin-seam <b>coal</b> <b>face</b> is comparatively easy in line with the criteria for classification on strata stability of gently-inclined <b>coal</b> <b>faces</b> in China. Hydraulic supports of two-prop shielding with rated effective resistance of 2400 kN can be employed in thin seam <b>coal</b> <b>faces.</b> Basic requirements for coordination equipments of shearer are summed up while mining thin seams. According to successful experiences of extracting thin seams in similar geological conditions in China, the scheme of feasibility coordination equipments of shearer is optimized in thin seams with thickness of 0. 8 - 1. 4 m and 1. 1 - 1. 9 m, respectively. The conclusions will provide a reference value for Caoyao Coal Mine on carrying out mechanized mining of the mine, improving safety production capability, and prolonging the mine life...|$|R

5000|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{longwall}} mining {{was developed in}} England in the late 17th century. Miners undercut the coal along {{the width of the}} <b>coal</b> <b>face,</b> removing <b>coal</b> as it fell, and used wooden props to control the fall of the roof behind the face. This was known as the Shropshire method of mining. While the technology has changed considerably, the basic idea remains the same, to remove essentially all of the coal from a broad <b>coal</b> <b>face</b> and allow the roof and overlying rock to collapse into the void behind, while maintaining a safe working space along the face for the miners.Starting around 1900, mechanization was applied to this method. By 1940, some referred to longwall mining as [...] "the conveyor method" [...] of mining, after the most prominent piece of machinery involved. [...] Unlike earlier longwall mining, the use of a conveyor belt parallel to the <b>coal</b> <b>face</b> forced the face to be developed along a straight line. The only other machinery used was an electric cutter to undercut the <b>coal</b> <b>face</b> and electric drills for blasting to drop the face. Once dropped, manual labor was used to load coal onto the conveyor parallel to the face and to place wooden roof props to control the fall of the roof.|$|R

40|$|Excessive {{emissions}} of methane from the coal seams {{can have a}} serious adverse effect on both safety and productivity of longwall <b>coal</b> <b>faces.</b> Mechanization of <b>coal</b> <b>faces</b> has increased production possibilities {{to the extent that}} normal ventilation systems {{may not be able to}} ventilate <b>coal</b> <b>face</b> areas in order to lower methane content in the air to within legal limits. Production increases may therefore be prohibited for this reason, especially in gassy seams. Methane drainage from the coal seam by means of long holes and before production starts can act as a useful remedial action. In this paper a two dimensional mathematical model has been produced. The model that is based on finite elements, simulates a methane drainage system where the resultant risk is linked to the coefficient of diffusion, coal permeability, holes pattern and the duration for which the seam is subject to drainage. It is concluded that methane drainage of this type can assist in achieving production increases in many coals seems, especially where high gas content is a virtue of the seam...|$|R
