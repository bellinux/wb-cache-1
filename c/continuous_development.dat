5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that smaller-sized P. rebeli from Hungary {{normally}} eclose {{at the end of}} June or mid-July; however, when these populations are studied in laboratories, they do not eclose until late August. This has led researchers to speculate that P. rebeli larvae that do not receive adequate food can still fully develop in one year and act as a functioning adult. However, they are unlikely to be bivoltine (producing two broods in one season). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that certain researchers claim that P. rebeli larvae can have <b>continuous</b> <b>development.</b>|$|E

40|$|In a {{hospital}} environment {{the focus is}} on quality patient care. One of the important factors {{to improve the quality of}} patient care is the implementation of a <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> programme. In a <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> programme of {{a hospital}} three stakeholders namely management, clinical facilitators and the nurse practitioners are identified as partners. When the stakeholders reach a point where it is believed that the <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> programme does not serve its purpose to improve the quality of patient care it is time to evaluate and refine the programme. This study evaluate the critical care and high care units in a private hospital in Gauteng’s <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> programme and the conclusions and recommendations are therefore limited to this specific clinical setting. The refinements recommended cannot be utilised in other clinical setting but the evaluation and research methodology can be utilised to evaluate similar <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> programmes. Evaluation of a <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> has the potential to negatively influence the nurse practitioners attitude towards <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development.</b> The objective of the research approach chosen namely a 4 -D Appreciative Inquiry approach was to gain the collaboration of all the stakeholders in an effort to ensure that the evaluation of the <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> programme of the critical care and high care units in the private hospital in Gauteng does not negatively affect the delivery of quality patient care. The Appreciative Inquiry research approach with its positive approach lends it to be the most appropriate research methodology of the study. The study utilised a Focus Group Inquiry as data a collection mechanism. From the study In-service training emerged as the element that form an important element of an effective <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> programme but that it is of the at most importance that an effective Workplace learning environment exists. The supportive role of Management for a <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> programme also emerged as one of the main themes required for the implementation of a <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> programme. These findings were utilised in the refinement for the <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> programme for the critical care and high care units in the private hospital in Gauteng. The research recommends that a steering committee be appointed to implement a pilot <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> programme that incorporate the refinement elements identified. Due to the continuous improvement nature of the Appreciative Inquiry methodology it is also recommended that the pilot <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> programme been re-evaluation to ensure long-term success and improvement.

5|$|The River Lea was {{a smaller}} {{boundary}} than the Thames, {{but it was}} a significant one. The building of the Royal Docks consisting of the Royal Victoria Dock (1855), able to berth vessels of up to 8000tons; Royal Albert Dock (1880), up to 12,000tons; and King George V Dock (1921), up to 30,000tons, on the estuary marshes, extended the <b>continuous</b> <b>development</b> of London across the Lea into Essex for the first time. The railways gave access to a passenger terminal at Gallions Reach and new suburbs created in West Ham, which quickly became a major manufacturing town, with 30,000 houses built between 1871 and 1901. Soon afterwards, East Ham was built up to serve the new Gas Light and Coke Company and Bazalgette's grand sewage works at Beckton.|$|E
5|$|The <b>continuous</b> <b>development</b> of Johor Bahru was, however, halted {{when the}} Japanese under General Tomoyuki Yamashita invaded the town on 31 January 1942. As the Japanese had reached {{northwest}} Johor by 15 January, they easily captured major towns of Johor such of Batu Pahat, Yong Peng, Kluang and Ayer Hitam. The British and other Allied forces {{were forced to}} retreat towards Johor Bahru; however, following a further series of bombings by the Japanese on 29 January, the British retreated to Singapore and blew up the causeway the following day as a final attempt to stop the Japanese advancement in British Malaya. The Japanese then used the Sultan's residence of Bukit Serene Palace located in the town as their main temporary base for their future initial plans to conquest Singapore while waiting to reconnect the causeway. The Japanese chose the palace as their main base because they already knew the British would not dare to attack it as this would harm their close relationship with Johor.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND : Society demands {{competent}} and safe health care, which obligates professionals to deliver quality patient care using current knowledge and skills. Participation in <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> programs {{is a way}} to ensure quality nursing care. Despite the importance of <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development,</b> however, critical care nurse practitioners’ attendance rates at these programs is low. OBJECTIVE : To explore critical care nurses’ reasons for their unsatisfactory attendance at a <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> program. METHODS : A nominal group technique was used as a consensus method to involve the critical care nurses and provide them the opportunity to reflect on their experiences and challenges related to the current <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> program for the critical care units. Participants were 14 critical care nurses from 3 critical care units in 1 private hospital. RESULTS : The consensus was that the central theme relating to the unsatisfactory attendance at the <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> program was attitude. In order of importance, the 4 contributing priorities influencing attitude were communication, <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development,</b> time constraints, and financial implications. CONCLUSION : Attitude relating to attending a <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> program can be changed if critical care nurses are aware of the program’s importance and are involved in the planning and implementation of a program that focuses on the nurses’ individual learning needs.

40|$|<b>Continuous</b> {{professional}} <b>development</b> {{has become}} {{an essential part of}} contemporary nursing practice. <b>Continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> implies that accident and emergency (A&E) practitioners can never stop learning. A&E practitioners therefore must be prepared to seek new challenges and reflect honestly upon their performance and experiences and adjust their practice in order to obtain and maintain quality service delivery. Network sampling was done and a focus group was used to collect data. This study sought to identify components for a structured reflective tool to enhance <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> of A&E practitioners. Reflection was seen as an important learning strategy and components for a structured reflective tool to enhance <b>continuous</b> professional <b>development</b> of A&E practitioners were identified. In addition essential elements that should be in place prior to the implementation of reflection into clinical practice were identified.
