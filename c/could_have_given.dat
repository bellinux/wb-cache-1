He suggested that another rider in the final part of the race <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> a better result, as Paolini's tiredness after a long spell {{at the front of}} the race meant that Kristoff had to start his sprint too early. Michael Matthews's third-place finish was the most significant result of his career, but he too was disappointed at having fallen short, after feeling strong on the climb of the Poggio.|$|E
5|$|Tales of the undead {{consuming}} {{the blood}} or flesh of living beings {{have been found}} in nearly every culture around the world for many centuries. Today we know these entities predominantly as vampires, but in ancient times, the term vampire did not exist; blood drinking and similar activities were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood; even the devil was considered synonymous with the vampire. Almost every nation has associated blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon, from the ghouls of Arabia to the goddess Sekhmet of Egypt. Indeed, some of these legends <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> rise to the European folklore, though they are not strictly considered vampires by historians when using today's definitions.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians {{planned to}} {{fight their way}} out eastward but—using a local double agent, usually known by his cover of François Toli—attempted to deceive Bonaparte into {{thinking}} {{they would try to}} march north, cross the Po, and head for Milan, joined by the remaining troops marching up from Genoa. The spy would advise Bonaparte to march via Sale on the northern side of the plain, so that he could be engaged by the Austrian left wing; meanwhile the main force would move through Marengo village in the centre, turn north, and fall into the French left flank. Ott arrived from Montebello of 13 June in a war council. The senior generals of the Austrian army strongly approved this plan, as the alternative would have meant that the Austrian army would have had to retreat along the river Po and leave Piedmont to the enemy without a fight. Nonetheless, by abandoning the San Giuliano plain, where the superior Austrian cavalry <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> him an edge, Melas probably made a serious mistake.|$|E

25|$|After this {{incident}} Atherton and England headed to Headingley, Leeds {{for the second}} Test. Atherton played {{one of his best}} innings, grinding out 99 before being caught and bowled by Brian McMillan. Atherton stated that this innings was the best answer he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> to the 'gutter press'. He led England to a win in the third Test at the Oval, which tied the series, although he failed to score a century.|$|E

25|$|According to legend, a {{portrait}} was painted of Monmouth after his execution: the tradition {{states that it}} was realised after the execution {{that there was no}} official portrait of the Duke – so his body was exhumed, the head stitched back on the body, and it was sat for its portrait to be painted. However, {{there are at least two}} formal portraits of Monmouth tentatively dated to before his death currently in the National Portrait Gallery in London, and another painting once identified with Monmouth that shows a sleeping or dead man that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> rise to the story.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} year in Division One, Hibs {{finished}} in a creditable third place. The club also reached the Scottish Cup final, where they were to meet Hearts. This {{raised the issue of}} where the match should be played, as the cup final is traditionally played in Glasgow. The Scottish Football Association decided that an Edinburgh venue would make more sense, and decided upon New Logie Green, the home of St Bernard's. Hearts won 3–1 before a crowd of 17,000. The following season a victory over Hearts in their final League match <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> them the league championship, but a 1–0 defeat allowed Hearts to go on claim the title instead.|$|E
25|$|The FBI and CDC {{investigation}} has been {{hampered by the}} destruction of a large collection of anthrax spores collected over more than seven decades and kept in more than 100 vials at Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa. Many scientists claim that the quick destruction of the anthrax spores collection in Iowa eliminated crucial evidence useful for the investigation. A precise match between the strain of anthrax used in the attacks and a strain in the collection would have offered hints as to when bacteria had been isolated and, perhaps, as to how widely it had been distributed to researchers. Such genetic clues <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> investigators the evidence necessary to identify the perpetrators.|$|E

25|$|When Mar Ukba {{was about}} to die, he asked to see his charity accounts. Finding gifts worth 7,000 Sijan gold denarii {{recorded}} therein, he exclaimed that the provisions were scanty and the road was long, and he forthwith distributed half of his wealth to charity. The Gemara asked how Mar Ukba <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> away so much, when Rabbi Elai taught that when the Sanhedrin sat at Usha, it ordained that if a person wishes to give liberally the person should not give more than {{a fifth of the}} person's wealth. The Gemara explained that this limitation applies only during a person's lifetime, as the person might thereby be impoverished, but the limitation does not apply to gifts at death.|$|E
25|$|In the 2003/2004 season White {{produced}} {{his most}} consistent season {{in over a}} decade. After reaching the semi-finals of the UK Championship in November 2003, White defeated Neil Robertson, Stephen Hendry and Peter Ebdon to reach the semi-finals of the 2004 Masters – where he lost a tight match against Ronnie O'Sullivan. White followed this up with further victories over Hendry and Robertson {{en route to the}} final of the European Open in Malta, but was beaten 3–9 by world number 48 Stephen Maguire. His last ranking victory to date came in April 2004, when White defeated Shaun Murphy, John Parrott, Ian McCulloch, Peter Ebdon and Paul Hunter to win the Players Championship in Glasgow – his first ranking title in over 11 years. Victory in the 2004 World Championship <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> White the number-one ranking, but he was beaten 10–8 by qualifier Barry Pinches after leading 4–2.|$|E
25|$|Gray Davis critics often {{charge that}} he did not respond {{properly}} to the crisis, while his defenders attribute the crisis solely to the corporate accounting scandals and say that Davis did all he could. Some critics on the left, such as Arianna Huffington, alleged that Davis was lulled to inaction by campaign contributions from energy producers. Some of Davis' energy advisers were formerly employed by the same energy speculators who made millions from the crisis. In addition, the Democratic-controlled legislature would sometimes push Davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities. Some conservatives argued that Davis signed overpriced energy contracts, employed incompetent negotiators and refused to allow prices to rise for residences statewide much like they did in San Diego, which they argue <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> Davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation. The electricity crisis {{is considered one of the}} major factors that led to Davis' recall.|$|E

Lynsey wears a naughty nurse's outfit on webcam for the show, further angering Silas who causes a blackout in Lynsey's flat, breaks in and grabs Lynsey from behind. Silas steals her ring but when Riley hears her screams he leaves. Upon hearing Silas' voice, Lynsey accuses {{him of being}} her attacker. Riley refuses to believe Lynsey and {{due to lack of}} evidence the police do not investigate. Lynsey and Texas begin to question whether Silas is responsible for India's murder. When searching Silas' belongings for her ring, Lynsey is interrupted by Riley and returns home to discover her ring has been returned. Texas makes Riley doubt Silas' innocence and when Lynsey accuses Silas of murdering India, Riley questions Silas. Silas collapses with a heart attack and is taken to hospital where Lynsey is assigned as Silas' nurse. Assuming he is faking a heart attack, Lynsey removes his oxygen mask and questions Silas about his innocence. Silas' daughter Heidi finds Lynsey withholding treatment from Silas and calls for help leading to Lynsey being suspended. Lynsey gives Cheryl some diet pills, which Silas replaces with his heart medication. Cheryl falls, knocking herself unconscious which leads to the discovery of sedatives in her system. Silas tells Cheryl that Lynsey <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> her the sedatives, making her doubt Lynsey's state of her mind.|$|E
