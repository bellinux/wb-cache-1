5|$|Michael and Olga {{frequently}} went on {{hikes in}} the forests around Gatchina with their father, who {{took the opportunity to}} teach them woodsmanship.

5|$|A one-yard rush was {{followed}} by a pass to running back Ken Oxendine that lost three yards. Following the negative-yardage play, North Carolina committed a five-yard penalty that gave the Hokies a third down and seven. Despite the extra yardage provided by the penalty, Clark's pass attempt on third down was incomplete and the Hokies again prepared to punt. During the kick, however, North Carolina defender Quinton Savage broke through the Virginia Tech offensive line and blocked the punt by Jimmy Kibble. Tar Heels' defender Dre Bly picked up the loose ball and ran into the end zone for North Carolina's second touchdown of the game. Following the play, North Carolina was penalized 15 yards for excessive <b>celebration</b> <b>and</b> the resulting 35-yard extra point kick was no good. Despite the missed kick, North Carolina extended its lead to 160 with 1:03 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|At the plantation, Northup meets Patsey, {{a favored}} slave who can pick over 500 pounds of cotton a day, twice the usual quota, whom Epps {{regularly}} rapes and abuses. Some time later, cotton worms destroy Epps's cotton. Unable {{to work his}} fields, Epps leases his slaves to a neighboring plantation for the season. While there, Northup gains the favor of the plantation's owner, Judge Turner, who allows him to play the fiddle at a neighbor's wedding anniversary <b>celebration,</b> <b>and</b> to keep his earnings. When Northup returns to Epps, he attempts {{to use the money}} to pay a white field hand and former overseer, Armsby, to mail a letter to his friends in New York State. Armsby agrees, and accepts Northup's saved money, but immediately betrays him to Epps. In {{the middle of the night}} Epps wakes Solomon and questions him menacingly about the letter. Northup is narrowly able to convince Epps that Armsby is lying and Epps relents.|$|E
5|$|Both {{before the}} {{establishment}} of Australia Day as the national day of Australia, and {{in the years after}} its creation, several dates have been proposed for its <b>celebration</b> <b>and,</b> at various times, the possibility of moving Australia Day to an alternative date has been mooted. Some reasons put forward are that the current date, celebrating the foundation of the Colony of New South Wales, lacks national significance; that the day falls on school holidays which limits the engagement of schoolchildren in the event; and that it fails to encompass members of the indigenous community and some others who perceive the day as commemorating the date of an invasion of their land. Connected to this is the suggestion that moving the date would be seen as a significant symbolic act.|$|E

5|$|Dunn {{trained and}} showed Tennessee Walking Horses for 50 years, and {{during his career}} won two World Grand Championships and 20 World Championships with various horses, {{competing}} in 125 to 150 horse shows a year. Dunn participated in the breed's major annual horse show, the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, nearly every year from 1950. By 1993 he was so popular that he often signed autographs for several hours before a performance. In total, Dunn personally showed 108 horses at the <b>Celebration,</b> <b>and</b> several hundred others which he trained were shown by other riders. Among them was Sundust Royal Flush, a stallion who, at the 1970 Celebration, won both the Preliminary Stallion class and the Three-Year-Old World Championship. Among other winning horses were Stock Exchange, who won the Junior Stallion Championship at the Dixie Jubilee in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1984, and Yankee Delight, who won the Grand Championship at the same show. Dunn rode both horses to their wins. Among horses that were trained by Dunn but ridden by amateur riders, Delight Puff and Stuff was Amateur Champion, and Aces Executive was Ladies' Champion, also in 1984.|$|E

Traveling with men-at-arms, horses, gold and equipment, Carrouges and his entourage rode to Sluys and took ship to Leith during the spring of 1385.|$|E
