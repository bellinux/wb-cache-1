5|$|In {{order to}} win the 2004game against the Kansas Jayhawks, Texas had to <b>convert</b> <b>a</b> 4th-and-18situation and {{complete}} a touchdown pass with only elevenseconds remaining on the clock. The 2005game provided much less on-field drama, as Texas led 52–0 by halftime and defeated Kansas 66–14.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the game {{turned into a}} {{defensive}} battle. Neither side scored {{until late in the}} third quarter, when Tech took advantage of a State fumble to score the first touchdown of the second half. Tech failed to <b>convert</b> <b>a</b> two-point conversion, but NC State fumbled again on the ensuing possession, and Tech was able to drive for another touchdown. Leading 22–21, Tech attempted another two-point conversion, which also failed.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} quarter in {{possession}} of the ball in Tennessee territory, attempting to capitalize upon a drive begun in the third quarter. Tennessee's defense, however, allowed only one yard {{on the first two}} plays of the quarter, and Tech placekicker Waldron returned to the field to <b>convert</b> <b>a</b> 46-yard field goal, extending Virginia Tech's lead to 27-14 with 13:33 left in the game.|$|E

A muezzin was appointed to perform the Islamic call to prayer and Sufi rites directly next to the Wall. These were seen as a provocation by the Jews who prayed at the Wall.

5|$|In the game, coach Mack Brown and his Texas Longhorns beat USC by {{the score}} of 41–38 and ended USC's 34game win streak. The game's outcome {{was still in}} doubt late in the fourth quarter, when the Trojans tried to <b>convert</b> <b>a</b> fourth down play that would win the game for them. After they were stopped Young led the Longhorns on a {{touchdown}} drive that was capped by his fourth down rush for the twelveyard touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Ole Miss {{scored the}} only {{points of the}} third quarter on a 12-yard Randall Mackey {{touchdown}} run that capped a 70-yard drive that saw the Rebels <b>convert</b> <b>a</b> pair of fourth downs. The final margin of 33–14 was provided by a pair of Shelley field goals from 26 and 24 yards in the fourth quarter. In the game, McCarron eclipsed Brody Croyle's team record of 190 consecutive pass attempts without throwing an interception. Starting wide receiver DeAndrew White and backup running back Demetrius Hart both suffered knee injuries {{during the course of the}} game that sidelined both of them for the remainder of the season. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Rebels to 46–9–2 (50–8–2 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|SMU struck {{first in}} the second quarter via a 17-yard rush from Gilbert, their quarterback, to put the Bulldogs up 7-0. Fresno State's ensuing drive started with a first down, but ended when quarterback Derek Carr was sacked by SMU defender Margus Hunt; Hunt forced a fumble that was {{recovered}} by the Mustangs at the Fresno State 16-yard line. SMU gained only three yards on their drive, but due to their excellent field position, kicker Chase Hover was able to <b>convert</b> <b>a</b> 30-yard field goal making it 10-0.|$|E

For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese, but such cheeses {{might not be}} acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher gelatin, an animal product, derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carrageenan are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher fish products) pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{began its}} drive with an {{incomplete}} pass, which {{was followed by}} a short run. On third down, Vick prepared to throw the ball, but he was hit by Clemson defender Keith Adams and fumbled the ball. Fellow Clemson defender Terry Jolly recovered the loose football and returned it to the Tech 14-yard line before he was tackled. Following the turnover, Dantzler was stopped on a short run then threw two incomplete passes. Rather than again attempt to <b>convert</b> <b>a</b> fourth down, Bowden sent in kicker Aaron Hunt to attempt a 28-yard field goal. The kick soared through the uprights, and Clemson narrowed Virginia Tech's lead to 1410 with 5:45 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Mikoyan-Gurevich I-211 was a {{prototype}} high-altitude Soviet fighter aircraft built during World War II. It was {{a version of}} the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-210, itself a variant of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3, fitted with a Shvetsov ASh-82F radial engine. Its development was quite prolonged, although successful, but by the time it finished its manufacturer's trials in early 1944 {{there was no need for}} a high-altitude fighter and it was not worth reducing the production of existing fighters to <b>convert</b> <b>a</b> factory over to the I-211.|$|E

5|$|The general {{goal of a}} {{level is}} to gain control over every village on an island, {{accomplished}} through acts that persuade the villagers {{to believe in the}} player. Villagers can be swayed by everything from assistance with day-to-day tasks to being terrorised by fireballs and lightning storms. Artefacts (special objects that glow in their owner's colour) and missionary disciples can be used to impress villagers. Villagers become bored with repetitive attempts to impress them. For example, if boulders fly overhead too frequently, their effect is lost. This forces the player to use multiple methods to <b>convert</b> <b>a</b> village.|$|E
5|$|After Kansas {{failed to}} <b>convert</b> <b>a</b> shot on their next possession, North Carolina {{proceeded}} {{to pass the}} ball {{around the perimeter of}} the court for close to two minutes. After finding the right setup, Lennie Rosenbluth drove to the basket and scored. Following that possession, Kansas began to make outside jump shots. When combined with Carolina's inability to score, Kansas' improved jump shots led to a 102 Kansas run, with Kansas taking the lead nine minutes into the second half. In addition, as North Carolina players continued to foul Chamberlain in order to make him score from the free throw line, they began to get into foul trouble. Kansas' coach Dick Harp then began to hold the ball beginning with their next possession. Harp's plan worked for a while as Carolina was not able to overcome Kansas' three point lead; Kansas did not attempt a shot for over five minutes.|$|E
5|$|If {{a player}} is dealt {{a pair of}} eights, the total of 16 is {{considered}} a troublesome hand. In fact, the value 16 {{is said to be}} the worst hand one can have in blackjack. Since sixteen of the other fifty cards have a value of 10 and four have a value of 11, there is a strong chance of getting at least an 18 with either or both split cards. A hand totaling 18 or 19 is much stronger than having a 16. Splitting eights limits one's losses and improves one's hand. Probabilistic research of expected value scenarios shows that by splitting eights one can <b>convert</b> <b>a</b> hand that presents an expected loss to two hands that may present an expected profit or a reduced loss, depending on what the dealer is showing. A split pair of eights is expected to win against dealer upcards of 2 through 7 and to lose less against dealer upcards of 8 through ace. If a player hits on a pair of eights, he is expected to lose $52 for a $100 bet. If the player splits the eights, he is expected to lose only $43 for a $100 bet.|$|E
