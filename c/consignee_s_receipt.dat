40|$|The {{market for}} the {{licensing}} of intellectual property and other intangibles is growing rapidly in the United States. At {{the same time there}} is increasing interest in the value of these intangible assets and their impact on economic growth, productivity, and competitiveness. Despite this interest there are large gaps in the available data to track and evaluate the impact of intangibles and intellectual property on the economy. This paper describes the measurement challenges and presents both aggregate and industrial sector preliminary estimates of receipts of royalties and license fees. These estimates can be used to better assess the macroeconomic impact of intangibles and to trace the flows and impacts across industries. This paper uses previously unpublished estimates of BEA International Services trade data for royalty and licensing fees by industry sector to improve the current output measures for domestic producers of intellectual property by estimating the share of royalty income earned by different types of intangible assets for 2002. These assets are patents and trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, and franchised business formats. The estimates show that U. <b>S.</b> <b>receipts</b> for the use of these intellectual property assets totaled approximately $ 92 billion dollars in 2002; this compares with rental and leasing receipts for automobiles, machinery, computers, and other equipment of $ 95. 1 billion dollars in 2002...|$|R

Another is to immediately and permanently cut all spending, apart from servicing outstanding debt, by 22. 4 percent. How can a country with vast energy resources and foreign reserves and other financial assets that exceed its official debt still have very major fiscal problems? The answer is that the Russia 2 ̆ 019 s energy resources are finite, whereas its expenditure needs are not. Moreover, Russia is aging and facing massive obligations from its pension system and other age related expenditures...|$|R
40|$|Droughts are of {{economic}} interest {{not because of}} the physical damage they cause, but because of the financial consequences that result from the physical damage. This distinction is not trivial, as physical damage may not result in economic loss. In an article recently published in Agricultural Policy for the 21 st Century (Iowa State University Press (ISUP)) and adapted for a forthcoming article in CHOICES, I discuss an empirical finding that the price flexibility obtained by regressing the spring-to-harvest change in harvest futures price on the spring-to-harvest change in average U. S. yield has not differed significantly from- 1 over the period beginning with the 1974 crop year for corn, cotton, oats, soybeans, and wheat. This finding implies that, on average, the product of market-level price and market-level yield, i. e., average U. S. per acre cash receipt, does not change as average U. S. yield changes from spring to harvest. The procedures are discussed briefly in the appendix. Risk is conventionally divided into (1) systemic risk, or risk at the market level, and (2) idiosyncratic risk, or risk unique to the individual. Thus, the above finding can be interpreted as implying that, on average, systemic U. S. yield risk does not translate into systemic U. <b>S.</b> cash <b>receipt</b> risk. In other words, on average the so-called “natural hedge ” between U. S. average price and U. S. average yield was perfect over the last quarter century for these five major U. S. field crops.

40|$|Under Pennhurst, a {{court may}} {{conclude}} that Congress has imposed a condition on the grant {{of federal funds}} to a state recipient only if Congress unambiguously expressed its intent to do so; under Chevron, the existence of statutory ambiguity {{with respect to a}} particular issue requires the reviewing court to defer to a reasonable agency interpretation of the ambiguous statutory language. What, then, should a court do when the terms of a federal-state grant program 2 ̆ 7 s condition are not fully elaborated in the statute and when the agency charged with enforcing the statute has issued regulations that purport to define the terms of the condition? Such controversies arise at the crossroads of administrative law and federalism principles. They raise the question whether Chevron deference, which is appropriate only when a statute is ambiguous, ever is warranted when the statutory provision at issue attaches a condition to a state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>receipt</b> of funds - a provision that must, in order to be effective under Pennhurst, attach the condition unambiguously. This Essay considers whether the usual principles of Chevron deference govern the interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions in federal-state grant programs. Resolution of this question depends principally on how one characterizes Pennhurst 2 ̆ 7 s clear-statement rule. The first approach, which I call the 2 ̆ 2 accountability model, 2 ̆ 2 treats Pennhurst 2 ̆ 7 s rule as a structural mechanism to ensure congressional accountability when Congress imposes burdens on the states. Under this framework, Congress (which, at least theoretically, represents the interests of the states), in contradistinction to administrative agencies (which do not), must unambiguously decide whether to impose a particular burden on the states. The second approach, which I call the 2 ̆ 2 state choice model, 2 ̆ 2 views Pennhurst 2 ̆ 7 s rule as a means to ensure notice - and thus fairness - to the states when a federal grant program imposes a burden on the state recipients. Under this account, the question of which federal actor (that is, Congress or the agency) has imposed a condition on the state is not determinative; the inquiry focuses instead on whether, in light of the information available when the state accepted federal funds, the state can fairly be said to have understood the nature of the bargain, and thus had the opportunity 2 ̆ 2 freely 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 choose 2 ̆ 2 whether to accept the funds. This Essay argues that the accountability model upsets the delicate balance that Pennhurst achieved between federal and state interests and undermines the important values advanced by the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Chevron. By requiring an unrealistic standard of congressional precision, the accountability model effectively converts Pennhurst 2 ̆ 7 s rule from an interpretive tool to a substantive limitation on Congress 2 ̆ 7 s power to regulate through the spending power. The state choice model, on the other hand, accommodates the values advanced by Chevron and limits Pennhurst 2 ̆ 7 s application to those cases that involve obvious unfairness to the states. An agency regulation provides a state with notice of its federal obligations just as effectively as a statute does, and states accordingly should be bound if the administering agency has issued an interpretation of the statutory grant condition before the state accepts funds...|$|R
40|$|In Florida, the {{ad valorem}} {{property}} tax {{is the single}} most important source of revenue for local governments. Considerable revenue is lost to local governments when property that should be taxed is not taxed because of mistaken application of the governmental immunity doctrine. Most governmentally owned property is used by the governmental entity for governmental purposes and remains nontaxable. However, when governmentally owned property is used by a nongovernmental person for a nonexempt use, the property no longer enjoys governmental immunity and is taxable. After all, such property is being used for private, profit-seeking purposes in competition with nongovernmentally owned property being used for similar purposes; the privately owned property is taxable, and so too is the governmentally owned property. It is a matter of compelling public interest that Florida 2 ̆ 7 s tax system is applied in a fair, evenhanded manner [...] that similarly situated taxpayers be taxed in the same manner. When property is being used for private, nonexempt purposes, it should be subject to ad valorem taxation, regardless of who owns the underlying fee interest in the property. Part II of this article briefly discusses the governmental immunity doctrine and the circumstances under which it has been waived. Part III explores the waiver of immunity from ad valorem taxation in Florida when governmentally owned property is used by a nongovernmental entity for a nonexempt use. Part IV discusses the role that the state and local governments play in Florida in the imposition and collection of sales tax. Part V examines the governmental immunity doctrine in the context of Florida 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> gross <b>receipts</b> tax and documentary stamp tax...|$|R

Despite this immense growth and profound influence on our lives, there has been very little study into this emerging area. Delaney [1] argues, 2 ̆ 2 THE U. S.

From this we may suggest that an absence of academic study into gaming could result in an industry driven only by economics. In this paper we look at {{a vast number of}} different attitudes from academics that provide some insight into what makes a good video game.

40|$|Existing {{evidence}} suggests that U. <b>S.</b> Government budget <b>receipts</b> forecasts are unbiased and efficient. Our study {{is an attempt to}} examine the veracity of these findings. The time series framework employed in this study is distinguished from previous work in three ways. First, we build a model that explicitly admits serial correlation in the residuals by allowing for autoregressive, moving-average, serial correlation. Second, we employ the nonparametric Monte-Carlo bootstrap to free ourselves from reliance on asymptotic distribution theory which is suspect given the short data series available for this study. Third, we control for errors in the macroeconomic and financial assumptions used to produce the U. S. Government’s budget forecasts. We find that the U. S. Government’s annual, one-year ahead, budget receipts forecasts for fiscal years 1963 through 2003 are biased and inefficient. In addition, we find that these forecasts exhibit serial correlation in their errors and thus do not efficiently exploit all available information. Finally, we find evidence that is consistent with strategic bias that may reflect the political goals of the Administration in power. 1 Introduction...|$|R
