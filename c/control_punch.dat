40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances offer new ways for {{encouraging people to}} participate in physical activities. The NFC Orienteering app is developed for the orienteering sport. Orienteering is an outdoor sport, in which orienteers compete to navigate from one point to another {{as fast as possible}} using a map and a compass. The aim of the app was to eliminate the need of physical equipment such as a physical compass, a printed paper map and an electronic <b>control</b> <b>punch</b> device that are required in conventional way of orienteering sport. The primary goal of this thesis was to find the usability problems in the current prototype. In a usability test I organized a small orienteering track of 500 meters with the targeted end-users in its real context of use. Moreover, the study also involved measuring the essential user experience (UX) elements such as aesthetics, ergonomics, interest, frustration, motivation and effectiveness of the app. Classical usability testing method was used with some modifications to make it suitable for this study. The data was collected using different techniques such as think-aloud protocol, questionnaires, field observation, system logs and semi-structured interview. Usability testing identified many usability problems. Moreover, participants seemed to expect more complex and interesting features in the app. Despite the identified problems, all the participants were able to complete the orienteering track by visiting all 4 control points, which showed that the app fulfils its basic function. Most of the participants expressed their interest to use a better version of the app in the future. Finally, based on the test study I proposed a new design for the app...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a novel controllable mechanical metal forming press, {{which is a}} 2 -DOF planar mechanism driven by a large constant speed motor and a small servomotor. The constant speed motor provides the main power while the servomotor tunes the trajectory and velocity of the punch in order to realize the <b>controlled</b> <b>punch</b> motion. The new press needs high accuracy, repeatability and resolution to guarantee the <b>controlled</b> <b>punch</b> motion. Improving manufacturing and assembly process could help it, but sometimes is very difficult and not feasible. Therefore parameter calibration has {{a significant effect on}} the accuracy, repeatability and resolution of the press. In this work, a simple parameter calibration method is presented without using complex and precise metrology system. Experiment results indicate that this kind of calibration method is fast, easy, accurate and cost effective...|$|R

5000|$|The IBM Card Verifier was {{the first}} {{commercial}} device to use infrared LEDs. The LEDs replaced tungsten bulbs that <b>controlled</b> <b>punched</b> card readers. Infrared light was sent through the holes or blocked by the card, which not only significantly reduced the size and power required, but also improved the reliability. In November 1978, Tom M.

The paper is focused on analysis of the operations {{to be done on}} the formed panel when they are clamped and supported on the MPPT. From the results of finite element analysis, it can be concluded that the interval between punches is the key factor which affects accuracy of MPPT. And also sheet thickness, material and geometric shape have influence on performance of MPPT...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The paper {{introduces}} a new <b>Controlled</b> <b>Punch</b> Through (CPT) IGBT buffer for next generation devices, which utilise thin wafers technology. The new concept {{is based on}} very shallow buffers with optimized doping profiles enabling minimum silicon design thicknesses close to the theoretical limit for a given voltage class. The advanced shaping of the buffer doping profile brings additional degree of freedom in IGBT design. The work was car-ried out for 1200 V IGBTs, but the CPT buffer can be applied with advantages to any voltage class. While this approach is targeting mainly reduced ON-State losses, the IGBT maintains good block-ing, soft turn-off, wide SOA and good short circuit capability. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} a novel design strategy for iterative learning and repetitive controllers for systems with a high modal density, presented in the companion paper, on two experimental case studies. Both case studies are examples of active structural acoustic control, where the goal is to reduce the radiated noise using structural actuators. In the first case study, ILC is used to <b>control</b> <b>punching</b> noise. An electrodynamic actuator on the frame of the punching machine is driven by the ILC algorithm which takes advantage of the repetitiveness of the consecutive impacts to reduce noise radiation. In the second case study, an RC algorithm is used to control the noise radiated by rotating machinery, which is often mainly periodic. A piezoelectric actuator incorporated in the bearing is driven by the RC algorithm which is capable of reducing harmonics of the rotational frequency of the shaft. Both applications show the practical usefulness of the novel design strategy. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Many {{locations}} {{still use}} heat-sensitive tickets (and TRA's tourist branches still use Edmondsons), requiring one ticket examiner per fare <b>control.</b> Examiners <b>punch</b> and collect non-magnetic tickets, provide customer information and assistance, troubleshoot AFC malfunctions (e.g. mutilated tickets), and return cancelled (stamped) tickets to passengers requiring proof-of-travel for expense claims. TRA volunteers (with yellow vest) staff some gates. Volunteers, like America's auxiliary police and volunteer firefighters, include carefully selected and specifically trained {{members of the}} public, and retired industry personnel.

50|$|The {{original}} machine-readable medium {{used for}} data (as opposed to <b>control)</b> was <b>punch</b> card used for {{records in the}} 1890 United States Census: each punch card was a single record. Compare the journal entry from 1880 and the punch card from 1895. Records were well established {{in the first half}} of the 20th century, when most data processing was done using punched cards. Typically each record of a data file would be recorded in one punched card, with specific columns assigned to specific fields. Generally, a record was the smallest unit that could be read in from external storage (e.g. card reader, tape or disk).|$|R
50|$|There are 2 {{types of}} tablet presses: single-punch and rotary tablet presses. Most high speed tablet presses {{take the form}} of a {{rotating}} turret that holds any number of punches. As they rotate around the turret, the punches come into contact with cams which <b>control</b> the <b>punch's</b> vertical position. Punches and dies are usually custom made for each application, and can be made in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and can be customized with manufacturer codes and scoring lines to make tablets easier to break. Depending on tablet size, shape, material, and press configuration, a typical modern press can produce from 250,000 to over 1,000,000 tablets an hour.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE:: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the cytokine-related pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus retinopathy in human autopsy eyes. METHODS:: Fresh autopsy eyes were procured from clinically diagnosed patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who had died as a result of disease-related complications; eyes were immediately immersed in RNAlater. Clean 2 -mm trephines were used to punch individual pathologic retina in areas of cotton-wool spots and <b>control</b> <b>punches.</b> Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol extraction protocol, and the optimal density of the RNA was measured at an optical density of 260 nm. [Delta]Ct (cytokine) values were calculated using the comparative cytokine analysis method. The results are expressed as a mean fold modulation and as a statistical comparison of Ct values controlling for retinal areas without a lesion in the same eye. RESULTS:: The fold modulations and the statistical comparisons of the cytokines studied in tissues from cotton-wool spots and control retina, respectively, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (5. 32 x, P = 0. 04), and Bcl- 2 -associated X protein (1. 24 x, P = 0. 05) had a marked elevation of fold modulation and were statistically significant compared with control tissue. Interleukin- 8 (1. 09 x, P = 0. 18), interleukin- 4, and interleukin- 10 (2. 7 x, P = 0. 30) were not significantly expressed in cotton-wool spots.

40|$|In {{sheet metal}} {{fabrication}} using an NCT (numerically <b>controlled</b> turret <b>punch</b> press) machine, automatic tool selection {{is a major}} problem to be solved to improve its production performance. However, this operation has been done either manually or semi-automatically by human experts. In this paper, we have introduced the shape-index-set to handle the shape of sheet metal parts and developed an algorithm through which one can find the successive matching curves between two curve lists, one from the punching tool and the other from the boundaries of the sheet metal part. The algorithm is used to select the tools automatically to punch out the boundaries of sheet metal parts. Several experiments are presented to prove the successful tool selection. ...|$|R
