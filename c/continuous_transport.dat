2500|$|The {{first step}} in {{glycolysis}} is phosphorylation of glucose by a family of enzymes called hexokinases to form glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). This reaction consumes ATP, but it acts to keep the glucose concentration low, promoting <b>continuous</b> <b>transport</b> of glucose into the cell through the plasma membrane transporters. In addition, it blocks the glucose from leaking out [...] the cell lacks transporters for G6P, and free diffusion out of the cell is prevented due to the charged nature of G6P. Glucose may alternatively be formed from the phosphorolysis or hydrolysis of intracellular starch or glycogen.|$|E

40|$|An {{emergency}} {{situation in a}} <b>continuous</b> <b>transport</b> system is an undesirable phenomenon during which the continuity of production or technological processes is seriously endangered. This situation can be brought about by various factors. In technological equipment of environmental continuous belt conveyor systems and pipe conveyors various adverse critical conditions may arise, which may result {{in the creation of}} an {{emergency situation}}. In particular, both conveyor and supporting rollers being the most significant components of the conveyor belt can substantially contribute to the onset of an emergency situation. Any damage to them can lead to a reduction or a complete standstill of the <b>continuous</b> <b>transport</b> process, which impedes upon the subsequent production operations. This contribution describes the possibility of the measurement and assessment of normal contact forces, which are applied by the conveyor belt to the supporting rollers on the hexagonal idler roller support of the pipe conveyors. This allows an early prediction of the critical condition and thus any developing emergency situation can be forestalled...|$|E
30|$|At the {{beginning}} of the measurements between 2005 AD and 2006 AD, the <b>continuous</b> <b>transport</b> of the bed load in the downstream direction was limited because of these sediment traps. In 2006 AD, an event with a discharge of 26  m 3 /s and flow velocities of approximately 0.5  m/s occurred in the Inde catchment. Such an event occurs statistically five times in 1  year, especially during summer periods [36]. The sediment volume trapped in the seven sediment traps before (reference date August 2005 AD) and after the flood event (March 2006 AD) was compared, and the sedimentological composition of each trap was analyzed. The amounts of sediment deposited in the sediment traps were also analyzed and conclusions regarding the stability of the different river reaches between two sediment traps were drawn. Trapped material can be returned into the system and potentially compensate for the vertical erosion of the riverbed [37]. Today, all sediment traps are emptied irregularly, which allows the <b>continuous</b> <b>transport</b> of sediments inside the restoration area.|$|E
