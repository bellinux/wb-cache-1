40|$|The {{ozone layer}} {{depletion}} and its harmful impact on living beings have been a greater concern of all the scientists all over the world. The aim {{of this paper is}} to reveal the current status of stratospheric ozone over Pakistan. The annual, monthly and seasonal analyses have been performed in order to check the status. The variation in total <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> has been observed during these analyses and decrease in total <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> has been seen in all the investigations from 1987 - 2008. The correlation coefficient for JRA forecasted data and observed ozone data is 0. 6. Both the data sets show decline in ozone concentration. The total change calculated in annual depth of ozone is ? 5. 67 D. U and ? 4. 2 D. U in monthly depth of ozone. The seasonal analysis shows that the total change in ozone in summer is ? 6. 3 D. U, in spring ? 10. 5 D. U, in winter ? 3. 15 D. U and in autumn ? 2. 0 D. U. Maximum change in ozone thickness has been found in spring and minimum in autumn. The solar radiations, decrease in temperatures of stratosphere and carbon dioxide (CO 2) play significant role in {{ozone layer depletion}}. According to the findings of this study solar radiations and carbon dioxide (CO 2) are inversely proportional to the total <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone.</b> The correlation coefficient for solar radiations and ozone on annual basis is 0. 44 (R 2 = 0. 44) and on monthly basis is around 0. 35 (R 2 = 0. 35). Therefore the more intense the solar radiations the more ozone layer thinning will occur. The correlation coefficient for ozone and carbon dioxide is around 0. 3 (R 2 = 0. 3) during the study period. The decrease in stratospheric temperatures will cause the cooling of stratosphere which is ultimately responsible for ozone layer depletion. The total decrease analyzed in stratospheric temperatures during the study period is about ? 1. 3 ℃. It is observed that alarming rise in carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration is not only contributing to global warming in troposphere but cooling in the stratosphere...|$|E

40|$|This study {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to obtain ozone vertical profile information given coincident satellite measurements of both cloud-top pressure and above-cloud column ozone. This method is denoted "cloud slicing". In this study information of cloud-top pressure is derived from Geostationary Orbital Earth Satellite (GOES) infrared data, while above-cloud column ozone is obtained from the Earth Probe total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) instrument. Several case examples are presented showing the feasibility of this technique as well as providing new geophysical results. Because the TOMS instrument measures backscattered UV radiation, it does detect ozone lying below dense water vapor clouds. This opaque property of TOMS can be used directly in conjunction with co-located cloud-top pressure data to derive ozone profile information in the troposphere. The cloud slicing method is an extension of the "Convective Cloud Differential" (CCD) method. In the CCD method, tropospheric column ozone (i. e., the total vertical <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> lying in the troposphere) is computed by taking total column ozone with low reflectivity (R less than 0. 2) and subtracting from this a nearby measurement of above-cloud column ozone amount under conditions of high reflectivity (R greater than 0. 9). (High reflectivity away from snow/ice conditions coincides with strong convection and tropopause-level clouds). The key element in determining tropospheric ozone profile information from the cloud slicing method is to have simultaneous and co-located measurements of both above-cloud column ozone and cloud-top pressure...|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{short-lived}} biogenic and anthropogenic chemical {{species that are}} emitted into the atmosphere break down efficiently by reaction with OH and do not reach the stratosphere. Here we show {{the existence of a}} pronounced minimum in the tropospheric <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> over the West Pacific, the main source region for stratospheric air, and suggest a corresponding minimum of the tropospheric column of OH. This has the potential to amplify the impact of surface emissions on the stratospheric composition compared to the impact when assuming globally uniform OH conditions. Specifically, the role of emissions of biogenic halogenated species for the stratospheric halogen budget and the role of increasing emissions of SO 2 in Southeast Asia or from minor volcanic eruptions for the increasing stratospheric aerosol loading need to be reassessed in light of these findings. This is also important since climate change will further modify OH abundances and emissions of halogenated species. Our study is based on ozone sonde measurements carried out during the TransBrom cruise with the RV Sonne roughly along 140 – 150 ° E in October 2009 and corroborating ozone and OH measurements from satellites, aircraft campaigns and FTIR instruments. Model calculations with the GEOS-Chem Chemistry and Transport Model (CTM) and the ATLAS CTM are used to simulate the tropospheric OH distribution over the West Pacific and the transport pathways to the stratosphere.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of ozone measurements from Natal, Brazil (6 deg S, 35 W), {{with a focus}} on the seasonal behavior in the troposphere, is presented. The amplitude of seasonal cycle at Natal is much larger than at Panama (9 deg N), the only other tropical site for which similar data are available. Concentrations of ozone in the middle troposphere in the southern spring are unexpectedly high, 60 - 70 ppb, similar to values found at northern midlatitudes in summer, and larger by 20 - 30 ppb than values found at Panama and at southern midlatitudes. It is suggested that photochemical production of ozone associated with emissions of CO, hydrocarbons, and NO(x) from biomass burning may contribute significantly to the high values of ozone, but note that stratospheric intrusions could also play a role. The data available at present do not permit a definitive evaluation of the relative importance of these two sources of ozone. The data from Natal, in combination with recent aircraft and surface data, show that tropical ozone exhibits strong spatial and temporal inhomogeneities. The distribution of tropospheric ozone appears to be considerably more complex than the traditional view, which suggested a northern midlatitude maximum and north/-south hemispheric asymmetry. The seasonal cycle in the total <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> at Natal appears to mirror the behavior of the tropospheric contribution to the ozone column rather than the stratospheric contribution, and this may account for differences in the annual cycle of the total column at Natal versus other tropical locations...|$|E

The ozone profiles derived using the Ozone Profile Retrieval Algorithm (OPERA) based on optimal estimation and the Neural Network Ozone Retrieval System (NNORSY) both show Kelvin wave signals in agreement with previously identified signals in the GOME total ozone columns. However, because of the inadequate vertical resolution, these two data sets {{are not able to}} resolve the vertical structure of the Kelvin wave activity. The third data set, consisting of assimilated OPERA ozone profiles, does provide height-resolved information on Kelvin wave activity that is consistent with results from the analysis of GOME total ozone columns and ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA- 40) temperature data. Largest Kelvin-wave-induced perturbations of up to 0. 69 DU/km coincide with the maximum vertical gradient in ozone around 35 hPa and show an in-phase relationship with temperature perturbations in ERA- 40 as expected from theoretical considerations. These results indicate that the ozone perturbations in the lower stratosphere and in the total <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> are transport related.

It employs a low cost spectrometer coupled with fiber optics, which are aimed at the sun to collect solar radiation. Measurements taken throughout the day with this instrument exhibited a large variability. The DOAS procedure derives total column ozone from the analysis of daily DOAS Langley plots. This plot relates the measured differential column to the airmass factor. The use of such plots is conditioned by the time the concentration of ozone remains constant. Observations of ozone are typically conducted throughout the day. Observations of total column ozone were conducted for 5 months. Values were derived from both DOAS and Nebgen’s procedure and compared to satellite data. Although differences observed from both procedures to satellite data were similar, the variability found in measurements was reduced from 70 Dobson units, with Nebgen’s procedure, to 4 Dobson units, with the DOAS procedure. A methodology to measure atmospheric nitrogen dioxide using DOAS was also investigated.

An airborne expedition, including 21 experiments on two aircraft, was mounted for Punta Arenas, Chile, in August and September, 1987, to gather a wide range of data to understand the origins and implications of this phenomenon, known as the ozone hole. As a part of this expedition, a high resolution Fourier transform spectrometer was flown on the DC- 8, measuring the column amount of a number of trace gases above the flight altitude. Column results are presented only from the flight of September 21; results from other flights are included in an accompanying paper. The deduced column for ozone HCl, and NO 2 deduced from the spectra, plotted as a function of latitude are shown. It should be noted that there are many other factors varying as well as the latitude, but latitude seems to be the variable which most clearly provides a passage across the vortex boundary.

Results for both the upper and lower tropical troposphere show a year-round zonal wavenumber 1 pattern in column ozone with largest amounts in the Atlantic region (up to approx. 15 DU in the 100 - 400 hPa pressure band and approx. 25 - 30 DU in the 400 - 1000 hPa pressure band). Upper tropospheric ozone derived from cloud slicing shows maximum column amounts in the Atlantic region in the June-August and September-November seasons which is similar to the seasonal variability of CCD derived TCO in the region. For the lower troposphere, largest column amounts occur in the September-November season over Brazil in South America and also southern Africa. Localized increases in the tropics in lower tropospheric ozone are found over the northern region of South America around August and off the west coast of equatorial Africa in the March-May season. Time series analysis for several regions in South America and Africa show an anomalous increase in ozone in the lower troposphere around the month of March which is not observed in the upper troposphere. The eastern Pacific indicates weak seasonal variability of upper, lower, and total tropospheric ozone compared to the western Pacific which shows largest TCO amounts in both hemispheres around spring months. Ozone variability in the western Pacific is expected to have greater variability caused by strong convection, pollution and biomass burning, land/sea contrast and monsoon developments...|$|E

Chemical loss <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> occurred between altitudes of about 14 and 22 km (pressures from ~ 120 to 30 mbar) and resulted in a 61 ± 13 Dobson unit reduction in totalcolumn ozone between late November 1999 and 5 March 2000 (the date of the last balloon-bornemeasurement considered here). This loss estimate is valid for {{the core of the}} vortex during the timeperiod covered by the observations. It is shown that the observed changes in the O 3 versus N 2 Orelation were almost entirely due to chemistry and could not have been caused by dynamics. Thechemical loss <b>of</b> <b>column</b> <b>ozone</b> inferred from the balloon-borne measurements using the "ozoneversus tracer" technique is shown to compare well with estimates of chemical loss found usingboth the Match technique (as applied to independent ozonesonde data) and the "vortex-averageddescent" technique (as applied to Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement (POAM) III satellitemeasurements <b>of</b> <b>ozone).</b> This comparison establishes the validity of each approach for estimatingchemical loss <b>of</b> <b>column</b> <b>ozone</b> for the Arctic winter of 1999 / 2000...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a new flow-visualization technique {{based on the}} absorption of ultraviolet light by ozone. Ozone is an excellent tracer, because as a gas {{it has the same}} effective physical properties as air. Ozone strongly absorbs the principal line (253. 7 nm) of a mercury lamp, so that when an ozone-traced flow passes between a mercury lamp and a fluorescent screen, a sharp, shadow-like image <b>of</b> the <b>ozone</b> tracer is cast on the screen. Quantitative photometry can be carried out by replacing the screen with ultraviolet detectors that yield the path-integrated <b>column</b> density <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> in the flow. High-speed quantitative point monitoring (10 Hz at 10 ppb O 3) is possible with capillary probes and chemiluminescent analysis...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{erythemal}} UV {{radiation is}} mainly affected by total column ozone, aerosols, clouds, and solar zenith angle. The effect <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> {{on the surface}} UV radiation has been explored {{many times in the}} previous studies due to the decrease <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> layer. In this study, we calculated the effect of aerosols on the surface UV radiation as well as that <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> using data acquired from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). First, ozone, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and surface erythemal UVB radiation measured from satellite are compared with those from ground measurements. The results showed that the comparison for ozone was good with r (2) of 0. 92. For aerosol, there was difference between satellite measurements and surface measurements due to the insufficient information on aerosol in the retrieval algorithm. The r (2) for surface erythemal UV radiation was high (similar to 0. 94) but satellite measurements showed about 30 % larger values than surface measurements on average by not considering the effect of absorbing aerosols in the retrieval process from satellite measurements. Radiative amplification factor (RAF) is used to access the effect <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> and aerosol quantitatively. RAF for ozone was 0. 97 similar to 1. 49 with solar zenith angle. To evaluate the effect of aerosol on the surface UV radiation, only clear-sky pixel data were used and solar zenith angle and total <b>column</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> were fixed. Also, RAF for aerosol was assessed according to the single scattering albedo (SSA) of aerosols. The results showed that RAF for aerosol with smaller SSA (0. 90). The RAF for aerosol was 0. 09 similar to 0. 22 for the given conditions which was relatively small compared to that for ozone. However, considering the fact that aerosol optical depth can change largely in time and space while the total <b>column</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> does not change very much, it needs to include the effect of aerosol to predict the variations of surface UV radiation more correctly. close 3...|$|R
40|$|The Atacama Desert {{has been}} pointed out {{as one of the}} places on earth where the highest surface {{irradiance}} may occur. This area is characterized by its high altitude, prevalent cloudless conditions and relatively low <b>columns</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> and water vapor. Aimed at the characterization of the solar spectrum in the Atacama Desert, we carried out in February-March 2015 ground-based measurements of the spectral irradiance (from the ultraviolet to the near infrared) at seven locations that ranged from the city of Antofagasta (on the southern pacific coastline) to the Chajnantor Plateau (5, 100 m altitude). Our spectral measurements allowed us to retrieve the total ozone column, the precipitable water, and the aerosol properties at each location. We found that changes in these parameters, as well as the shorter optical path length at high-altitude locations, lead to significant increases in the surface irradiance with the altitude. Our measurements show that, in the range 0 - 5100 m altitude, surface irradiance increases with the altitude by about 27 % in the infrared range, 6 % in the visible range, and 20 % in the ultraviolet range. Spectral measurements carried out at the Izana Observatory (Tenerife, Spain), in Hannover (Germany) and in Santiago (Chile), were used for further comparisons...|$|R
