50|$|<b>Consequently,</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of {{building}} canals {{passed to the}} states. The Erie Canal in New York {{proved to be an}} early success after it was completed in 1825. The Ohio House and Senate had worked for two decades to pass legislation authorizing a canal, gaining success with the Act of February 4, 1825, which finally approved the construction of the Ohio canal system. The canal was largely state-funded, using money acquired from selling off land near where the canals were to be dug. The state government planned and built two canals in the state: the Miami and Erie Canal, from Cincinnati to Toledo, connecting the Ohio River and Lake Erie; and the Ohio and Erie Canal, which connected Cleveland, another lake port, to Portsmouth. This system provided the interior of Ohio with new travel routes that effectively extended to the major Atlantic port of New York City, as merchants could ship goods through Lake Erie, the Erie Canal and the Hudson River to New York.|$|E

Positive interventions which flow from the successful application of this enforcement process then reduce the incidence or severity of the nuisance, resulting in a more harmonious neighbourhood and a successful enforcement outcome.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Applications {{on modern}} {{supercomputers}} are in-creasingly {{limited by the}} cost of data movement, but mainstream programming systems have few abstractions for describing {{the structure of a}} program’s data. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of managing data movement, placement, and layout currently falls primarily upon the programmer. To address this problem we previously proposed a data model based on logical regions and described Legion, a programming system incorporating logical regions.

We show that structure slicing enables Legion to automatically infer task parallelism from field non-interference, decouple the specification of data usage from layout, and reduce the overall amount of data moved. We demonstrate that structure slicing enables both strong and weak scaling of three Legion applications including S 3 D, a production combustion simulation that uses logical regions with thousands of fields, with speedups of up to 3. 68 X over a vectorized CPU-only Fortran implementation and 1. 88 X over an independently hand-tuned OpenACC code.

40|$|Abstract. The image {{segmentation}} {{technology has been}} extensively applied in many fields. As the foundation of image identification, the effective {{image segmentation}} {{plays a significant role}} during the course of subsequent image processing. Many theories and methods have been presented and discussed about image segmentation, such as K-means and fuzzy C-means methods, method based on regions information, method based on image edge detection, etc. In this work, it is proposed to apply Bayesian decision-making theory based on minimum error probability to gray image segmentation. The approach to image segmentation can guarantee the segmentation error probability minimum, which is generally what we desire. On the assumption that the gray values accord with the probability distribution of Gaussian finite mixture model in image feature space, EM algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of mixture model. In order to improve the convergence speed of EM algorithm, a novel method called weighted equal interval sampling is presented to obtain the contracted sample set. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>the</b> computation <b>burden</b> of EM algorithm is greatly reduced.

40|$|Environmental {{conditions}} and external effects, such as shocks, {{have a significant}} impact on the calibration parameters of visual-inertial sensor systems. Thus long-term operation of these systems cannot fully rely on factory calibration. Since the observability of certain parameters is highly dependent on the motion of the device, using short data segments at device initialization may yield poor results. When such systems are additionally subject to energy constraints, it is also infeasible to use full-batch approaches on a big dataset and careful selection of the data is of high importance. In this paper, we present a novel approach for resource efficient self-calibration of visual-inertial sensor systems. This is achieved by casting the calibration as a segment-based optimization problem that can be run on a small subset of informative segments. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>the</b> computational <b>burden</b> is limited as only a predefined number of segments is used. We also propose an efficient information-theoretic selection to identify such informative motion segments.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} biomass energy dependency in Tanzania. The study was conducted based on the available literature on energy and biomass in Tanzania. Energy is essential to meet the most basic needs: cooking, boiling water, lighting, and heating. It is also a prerequisite for good health, a reality that has been largely ignored by the world community. More than 80 % of Tanzanians depend on biomass {{as a source of}} energy by burning firewood, dung, and other traditional fuels. Biomass use accounts for over 90 % of total energy consumption. In recent years biomass energy activities mainly firewood wood and charcoal have increased dramatically and the rapid population growth of both urban and rural areas, however, has placed severe strain on the biomass resources, which has led to desertification and deforestation of some areas. This paper reveals that one way of economizing on firewood and charcoal use is to improve their production methods and the use of energy efficient stoves. In addition, the use of alternative energy sources such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and biogas reduces the frequent use of firewood and charcoal and <b>consequently</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> on the forest resources...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A lot {{of hidden}} {{information}} {{is present in}} client programs of most existing online multi-player games. This hidden information is necessary for clients to render a player’s view of the game. However, the same hidden information can be exploited by cheaters to gain an unfair advantage over other players. Eliminating hidden information from the game client comes at a significant cost to the server, since it must now send the data required to render a client’s view on-demand. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of tracking a player’s view shifts from the client to the server, hindering scalability and degrading game performance. We propose SpotCheck, a more scalable approach for detecting information exposure cheats. The key idea is that servers still disseminate game state information on-demand, but clients retain the burden of tracking a player’s view. After each move, clients must submit a descriptor pertaining to the player’s view. The server then randomly chooses to validate the descriptor and sends back relevant game state information. Our experimental results show, that SpotCheck can reduce the server CPU overhead {{by as much as}} half when compared to the alternative, while still being an effective defense against information exposure cheats.

The healthcare expenditure per person, {{as well as the}} healthcare expenditure portion of personal income, have grown and will continue to increase. The effect of such increasing healthcare expenditures is to reduce real income. Such income reductions diminish total utility and increase financial stresses, especially among low income groups. One in five American adults is struggling to pay his healthcare bills, and over 62 % of all personal bankruptcies have a medical cause (Himmelstein et al., 2009). Many with coverage are found to be under-insured and to have a responsibility for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. Even though others have private insurance, they lose it when they become too sick to work. 25 % of companies withdraw healthcare insurance immediately when their employees suffer from illness. Another 25 % do so within 1  year (Pereira 2003). The loss of income from illness is common, but can often be coupled with high healthcare bills. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of healthcare expenditure is linked to widespread indebtedness.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study aims to {{determine}} the burden of illness imposed by severe sepsis in Switzerland by evaluating the direct and indirect patient-related costs for critically ill patients with severe sepsis. METHODS: In order to estimate the direct costs a retrospective analysis was undertaken using records from 61 adult patients treated in three intensive care units (ICUs) in three different University hospitals in Switzerland, in 2001. Resource use was determined by a bottom up approach and valued using centre-specific unit costs for medication, nutrition, blood products, disposables and official tariffs for laboratory and microbiology analysis, diagnostic services, and clinical procedures. By adding centre-specific personnel and basic bed (hotel) costs total direct costs in the ICU were calculated. Indirect costs resulting from unfitness for work, early retirement, and premature death were calculated using official Swiss statistics for the years 1998 - 2000. RESULTS: The mean total direct costs for a severely septic patient are CHF 41, 790 (+/- 33, 222 CHF) or CHF 3244 (+/- 757 CHF) per day. Nonsurvivors cause significantly higher costs than survivors (CHF 45, 956 vs. CHF 37, 759, p < 0. 001). The total intensive care costs in Switzerland due to severe sepsis amount to CHF 146 - 355 million. Indirect costs were estimated to range from CHF 347 to 844 million (predominantly due to premature death). <b>Consequently</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of illness of severe sepsis can be estimated to range from CHF 493 to 1199 million per year in Switzerland (1 CHF = 0. 662 Euro in 2001). CONCLUSION: Patients suffering from severe sepsis in Switzerland have a high mortality rate and spend a prolonged time in the ICU, leading to high direct and indirect costs.

40|$|This essay uses theistic humanism as a super {{structure}} to do a hermeneutic {{appraisal of the}} doctrine of salvation in a pluralistic world. It operates on the assumption that reality is multidimensional, just as human belief systems and cultural perspectives are diverse. More importantly, is the point that most countries on the African continent house a potpourri of belief systems, prominent among which are Christianity, Islam and Traditional African Religion (ATR). Thus, theistic humanism offers us the opportunity to do a pluralistic assessment of salvation, thereby making myriad interpretations of the notion of salvation possible. Again, the essay neither intends to examine the meaning of God nor is it interested in analyzing how God gets manifested in human existence. Rather, the basic objective is to consider the various ways in which salvation has been conceived in relation to the human condition. In the process of our delineation, it shall be shown that salvation as a doctrine can be conceived from two principal angles which are: 1) the perspective of religion and 2) the non-religious or secularist perspective. Whereas the first presents other-worldly account of salvation, the second presents a this-worldly account of salvation. The import here is that since in the most ordinary sense, God is all about perfection and human goodness, it implies that the quest for salvation in whatever dimension, deliberately or inadvertently, amounts to the search for the ultimate essence or the most perfect state of reality which religions call God. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of this essay is to show that salvation is an ideal state of reality which humankind is striving to attain. Bearing in mind that humans as free beings that have the capacity to interpret salvation either anthropocentrically or theocentrically, thereby, making the myriad presentations of salvation possible; one is of the view that metaphysical notions of reality are also contagious of salvation. Hence, for monists and reductionists the way to salvation is narrow and single, while for the pluralists the way to salvation may be narrow but diverse. Thus, since the hermeneutic appraisal of salvation is hinged on the assumption that belief systems are diverse and multi-faceted, the essay privileges the pluralistic presentation of salvation over and above the monistic presentation of salvation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Research, {{especially}} in science, is increasingly data-driven (Hey & Trefethen, 2003). The obvious {{type of research}} data is raw data produced by experiments (by means of sensors and other lab equipment). However, other types of data are highly relevant as well: calibration and configuration settings, analyzed and aggregated data, data generated by simulations. Today, nearly all of this data is born-digital. Based on the recommendations for "good scientific practice", researchers are required to keep their data for a long time. In Germany, DFG demands 8 - 10 years for published results (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, 1998). Ideally, data should not only be kept and made accessible upon request, but be published as well - either {{as part of the}} publication proper, or as references to data sets stored in dedicated data repositories. Another emerging trend are data publication journals, e. g. the Earth System Science Data Journal ([URL] In contrast to these high-level requirements, many research institutes still lack a well-established and structured data management. Extremely data-intense disciplines like high-energy physics or climate research have built powerful grid infrastructures, which they provide to their respective communities. But for most "small sciences", such complex and highly specialized compute and storage infrastructures are missing and may not even be adequate. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of setting up a data management infrastructure and of establishing and enforcing data curation policies lie with each institute or university. The ANDS project has shown that this approach is even preferable over a central (e. g., national or discipline-specific) data repository (The ANDS Technical Working Group, 2007). However, delegating the task of proper data curation to the head of a department or a working group adds a huge workload to their daily work. At the same time, they typically have little training and experience in data acquisition and cataloging. The library has expertise in cataloging and describing textual publications with metadata, but typically lacks the disciplinespecific knowledge needed to assess the data objects in their semantic meaning and importance. Trying to link raw data with calibration and configuration data {{at the end of a}} project is challenging or impossible, even for dedicated "data curators" and researchers themselves. Consequently, researchers focus on their (mostly textual) publications and have no established procedures on how to cope with data objects after the end of a project or a publication (Helly, Staudigel, & Koppers, 2003). This dilemma can be resolved by acquiring and storing the data automatically at the earliest convenience, i. e. during the course of an experiment. Only at this point in time, all the contextual information is available, which can be used to generate additional metadata. Deploying a data infrastructure to store and maintain the data in a generic way helps to enforce organization-wide data curation policies. Here, repository systems like Fedora ([URL] (Lagoze, Payette, Shin, & Wilper, 2005) or eSciDoc ([URL] (Dreyer, Bulatovic, Tschida, & Razum, 2007) come into play. However, an organization-wide data management has only a limited added-value for the researcher in the lab. Thus, the data acquisition should take place in a non-invasive manner, so that it doesn 2 ̆ 7 t interfere with the established work processes of researchers and thus poses a minimal threshold to the scientist...|$|E
30|$|Another {{factor that}} has been less {{analysed}} as a determinant of social expenditure is public sector income. Few empirical {{studies have examined the}} role of revenue constraints as a determinant of social spending (Garrett 1998; Kato 2003; Lindert 2004; Haggard and Kaufman 2004). They have argued that the fragile ability of fiscal institutions to collect taxes could be responsible for Latin America’s low social expenditures during the 1980 s and 1990 s (Haggard and Kaufman 2004). This fact is reinforced by the weak level of <b>the</b> fiscal <b>burden</b> in almost all countries of the region (Aldunate and Martner 2006). Governments with lower revenues and higher commitments to social services are more likely to face greater constraints on social spending, even under strong pressure from the beneficiaries (Haggard and Kaufman 2004). In addition, Gupta (1967) and Nomura (1991, 1995) have observed that the rise in revenue collection {{goes hand in hand with}} economic growth. Burgess and Stern (1993), Tanzi and Zee (2000), Fox and Gurley (2005) find a positive correlation between tax revenue and GDP per capita. This evidence ties in with Wagner’s law of increasing state activity (Bird 1971), which states that government activities grow with the economic development of a country over time, through increasing public expenditure to satisfy social needs. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>the</b> fiscal <b>burden</b> and its connection with GDP per capita and its growth might also explain the dynamics of social spending.|$|R

However, {{with the increase in}} human obesity and its health complications, this study was done to compare L-AmBi tissue distribution in young, non-obese versus older, obese uninfected and Candida albicans infected mice. Methods: Cyclophosphamide immunosuppressed mice, uninfected or infected with 3. 0 x 10 ex 4 Candida albicans/mouse intravenously were treated intravenously with 5 or 10 mg/kg L-AmBi or 5 % dextrose (D 5 W) for five days. Tissues were collected 24 h post-treatment, homogenized, and assayed for fungal burden by determining CFU/g and for drug concentration by bioassay. Results: With all L-AmBi doses in both young and older mice, drug levels in kidneys, spleens and fat were 5 - 20 fold lower in uninfected vs infected mice indicating more drug accumulation at infection sites. All L-AmBi doses significantly reduced the yeast in kidneys, spleen and fat of infected mice vs D 5 W (P< 0. 01) with no detectable yeast in the liver. With respect to survival, L-AmBi at 5 or 10 mg/kg in the young or old mice was significantly better than D 5 W treated mice (p= 0. 03). Conclusion: Higher L-AmBi levels in all tissues, including fat, in infected versus uninfected mice support previous in vivo observations that L-AmBi targets to fungi in infected tissues, which leads to reduction in <b>the</b> fungal <b>burden</b> by <b>the</b> L-AmBi. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>the</b> fungal <b>burden</b> in individuals with higher body fat is likely to be greater than in non-obese individuals, requiring more aggressive treatment...|$|R

We tested 1105 serum samples from healthy population in both endemic and non-endemic areas in the country. Our results revealed a seroprevalence of 4. 0 % (range 0 - 9. 3 %) which is comparable to the seroprevalence in other countries. We show that seroprevalence is correlated to the disease incidence in each studied municipality. We also tested 401 animal sera (353 cow, 30 sheep, 10 goat and 8 chicken) in four endemic municipalities in Kosovo. We detected specific antibodies in all animals except in chicken. Seroprevalence in cows is comparable to other endemic areas and correlates to the seroprevalence in humans. No CCHF RNA could be detected in 105 tick samples obtained in 2012 and 2013.

40|$|Maatalouspolitiikan suhteen EU:n jäsenmaiden kansallinen liikkumavara on vähäinen. Verotus ja sosiaalipolitiikka kuuluvat kuitenkin melko pitkälle kansallisen päätäntävallan piiriin. Maa- ja metsätalousministeriön rahoittamassa tutkimushankkeessa on selvitetty Saksan maatalousverojärjestelmää saksalaisviljelijöiden mahdollisten kilpailuetujen ja -haittoja arvioimiseksi suomalaisiin viljelijöihin verrattuna. Tutkimuksesta käy ilmi, että saksalaisviljelijöiden maksettavaksi tulevan tuloveron määrä on noin 50 % alhaisempi kuin Suomessa. Saksassa maataloudenharjoittajien pakolliset sosiaalivakuutusmaksut ovat kuitenkin huomattavasti korkeammat kuin Suomessa. Vertailu osoittaa saksalaisten ja suomalaisten tilojen maksurasitteen olevan lähes yhtä suuren. Saksassa perintö- ja lahjaverosäännöstöstä on muodostettu selkeä kansallinen tukimuoto maataloudelle. Useat päällekkäiset vapaaosat, omaisuuden arvostamissäännökset ja siviilioikeudellisen lainsäädännön säännökset saavat aikaan sen, että vähennysten jälkeen maatiloille ei pääsääntöisesti jää maksettavaksi perintö- tai lahjaveroa, eikä tilanpidon jatkaja juuri koskaan maksa sukupolvenvaihdosluovutuksesta erillistä vastiketta. Saksassa tuloverotuksen edullisuus johtuu useista päällekkäisistä vähennyksistä. Ensin kunkin tulolajin sisällä vähennetään tulonhankkimismenot, jonka lisäksi kaikkien tulojen yhteissummasta tehdään vähennyksiä, joita ei voida kohdistaa yksittäisiin tulolajeihin. Saksassa suuret tilat ovat velvollisia pitämään kahdenkertaista kirjanpitoa. Hieman tätä pienemmät tilat ilmoittavat tulot kassaperusteisen meno-tulolaskelman mukaisesti. Kolmas menetelmä on kaavamainen pinta-alaperusteinen menetelmä, jossa todellisista tuloista tulee verotettavaksi 45 - 75 %. Tässä menetelmässä tuloverotus on edullisimmillaan, mutta sitä voivat käyttää vain pienet, tulokseltaan heikohkot ja sivutoimiset tilat. Mikäli maataloudenharjoittaja ei täytä ilmoitusvelvollisuuttaan, tulot arvioidaan. Arviointimenetelmä on ollut perinteisesti monille pientiloille edullinen, joten siihen ajaudutaan usein harkitusti. Saksan vuonna 1996 uudistettu perintö- ja lahjaverosäännöstö ulotti yritysten sukupolvenvaihdoksia koskevat veronhuojennukset myös maatalouteen. Perittäessä tai lahjoitettaessa maatalous- ja yritysomaisuutta omaisuuden arvosta voidaan vähentää 500 000 DM:n vapaaosa ja jäljelle jäävästä summasta vielä 40 %. Huojennus kohdistuu maatilan peltoihin, metsään ja maataloustyöntekijöiden asuntoihin. Käteisvarat ja maanviljelijän oma asunto lisätään huojennettuun omaisuuteen. Huojennuksen ja muiden vähennysten jälkeen lahjansaaja tai perillinen voi vähentää oman henkilökohtaisen vapaaosansa, joka on rintaperillisillä 400 000 DM. Saksan perintö- ja lahjaverotuksen edullisuus johtuu myös omaisuuden arvostusmenettelystä, jossa maatilan irtaimen omaisuuden, talousrakennusten, eläinten ja maitokiintiön arvo sisällytetään maapohjan arvoon. Käytännössä niiden osuus lopullisesta perintö- ja lahjaverotusarvosta on olematon. Uudistetun arvostusmenettelyn pohjalta määritettävät maapohjan arvot ovat lähellä tämän päivän reaalisia tuottoarvoja. Uudistuksessa arvot nousivat huomattavasti, mutta vastaavasti henkilökohtaisia vapaaosia nostettiin entisestä. Maatilojen sukupolvenvaihdosluovutusten edullisuuden takana vaikuttavat myös siviilioikeudelliset ja alueelliset sukupolvenvaihdosluovutuslait, joiden tarkoituksena on taata, että tila ei siirry suvun ulkopuolelle. Jatkajan kannalta siviilioikeudellisten sukupolvenvaihdoslakien suurimman hyödyn muodostavat lain sanelemat pienet väistyvien perillisten korvaukset ja se, että vanhemmille tuleva korvaus muodostuu yleensä vain syytingistä. The {{study is}} {{composed}} of two parts. He first part studies farmers income taxation in Germany. In Germany farmers may report their annual income for taxation according to three different taxation procedures. Large farms are obliged to double-entry bookkeeping and to report their incomes according to this. Smaller farms report their incomes according to cash basis expenditure and income calculation, and the information value of this is somewhat weaker than that of double-entry bookkeeping. The third procedure is a fully schematic method based on the area, and through this only about 45 - 75 % of the real income can be taxed. This method can be used only by small farms with weak results or part-time farms. The income taxation is the lowest when using the third method, {{which is based on}} averages. If a farmer fails to fulfill the reporting obligation, an estimation procedure of incomes is applied. The estimation procedure differs from the Finnish tax assessment by estimation in that it has traditionally been beneficial for many small farms, and thus it has been used deliberately. Farmers cannot choose the procedure to be used, but they are directed to the appropriate procedure {{on the basis of the}} size, result and economic value of the farm. If the farm size or the result changes, the farmer may change the procedure, but the change is binding for a certain period of time. When the amount of income taxes to be paid by German farms are examined, it can be noted that these are about 50 % lower than in Finland. Income taxation is the lowest when the taxpayer is married. The German legislation on income taxes is constructed so that the spouses may use tax tables of their own, and thus enjoy considerable tax concessions. The low income taxation is also partly caused by several overlapping deductions, which are first made within each type of income and, finally, deductions are made on the total of all types of income that could not be made in the case of the individual types of income. However, when the obligatory social security payments comparable to taxes in the countries in question were taken into account in addition to the amount of income taxes, the research result changed in a significant way. The social security expenses of German farmers are considerably higher than in Finland. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> caused by such payments on the Finnish and German farms is almost equal - on the German bookkeeping farms it is even a little higher than in Finland. This can be seen in the farm models presented in the latter part of the study. The second part of the study considers inheritance and gift duties of farms in Germany. The stipulations on inheritance and gift duties in Germany revised in 1996 extended the tax concessions concerning the change of generation in companies to agriculture as well. When agricultural or company property is inherited or given away, concession according to section 13 a of the act is directed to the property. Based on this concession, a free share of DM 500, 000 can be deducted from the value of the property, and a further deduction of 40 % can be made on the remaining amount. The concession concerns the arable land and forest of farms as well as residences of farm workers. Cash funds and the residence of the farmer are added to the property on which the concessions have been made. In addition to this concession, the recipient of the gift or heir may deduct a personal free share after all other deductions. In the case of direct heirs the personal free share is DM 400, 000. Due to the several overlapping free shares, in most cases there remain no inheritance or gift duties to be paid by farms. The low inheritance and gift duties in Germany are also partly based on the valuation of property in which the movable property, production buildings, animals or milk quotas are not valued separately. In practice the share of these of the final inheritance and gift duty value is DM 0. After the reform the old unit values defined in 1964 are no longer used as the basis for inheritance and gift duties. These were replaced by the first uniform valuation procedure applied in the whole country, and the values determined on the basis of this are close to the current realistic productive values of the ground. Thus the values rose considerably, but this was compensated by raising the personal free shares. One reason for the low payments in connection with changes of generation is also the regional act concerning the transfer of farms to descendants (Höfeordnung) based on the civil law, which makes sure that the farm is not transferred outside the family. The most significant benefits of acts concerning the change of generation that are based on the civil law consist of the small compensations to the heirs yielding the property and life-annuity to the parents. As a result of these factors the heir remaining on the farm hardly ever pays any separate compensations in connection with the transfer of the farm. Consequently, the low inheritance and gift duties in Germany are based on several overlapping free shares, valuation of the property, as well as stipulations based on the civil law that guarantee very low or no payments in connection with the transfer of a farm. vokMTT TaloustutkimusTaxation of agriculture in German...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{economic}} crisis in the UK. It argues that everyday accounting practices are deeply implicated in the inequitable distribution of income and wealth, {{a major cause of}} the economic crisis engulfing the neoliberal economies. Without adequate purchasing power middle and low income households cannot make the purchases necessary for a sustained revival of the economic activity. Accounting calculations and discourses {{play a major role in}} the determination of wages and taxes. They prioritise the interests of capital over labour and the state and have systematically eroded labour?s share of the gross domestic product. At the same time, despite a massive growth in corporate profitability, the UK state?s share of the national wealth in the form of tax revenues has also declined. It is argued that accounting practices which label payment of wages to labour and payment of taxes to the state as ?costs? amplify capitalist concerns about private appropriation of surpluses and have played a major role in assigning such payments to negative spaces. Through the sale of tax avoidance schemes to corporations and wealthy elites, accountancy firms have facilitated a skewed distribution of income of wealth and further constrained the state?s capacity to reflate <b>the</b> economy. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>the</b> tax <b>burdens</b> on <b>the</b> less well-off have increased and further eroded their purchasing power and possibilities of building a sustainable economy...|$|R
40|$|Summary Efforts {{to control}} malaria have been boosted {{in the past}} few years with {{increased}} international funding and greater political commitment. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>the</b> reported malaria <b>burden</b> is being reduced in a number of countries throughout the world, including in some countries in tropical Africa where <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of malaria is greatest. These achievements have raised new hopes of eradicating malaria. This paper summarizes the outcomes of a World Health Organization’s expert meeting on the feasibility of such a goal. Given the hindsight and experience of the Global Malaria Eradication Programme of the 1950 s and 1960 s, and current knowledge of the effectiveness of antimalarial tools and interventions, it would be feasible to effectively control malaria in all parts of the world and greatly reduce the enormous morbidity and mortality of malaria. It would also be entirely feasible to eliminate malaria from countries and regions where the intensity of transmission is low to moderate, and where health systems are strong. Elimination of malaria requires a re-orientation of control activity, moving away from a population-based coverage of interventions, to one based on a programme of effective surveillance and response. Sustained efforts will be required to prevent the resurgence of malaria from where it is eliminated. Eliminating malaria from countries where the intensity of transmission is high and stable such as in tropical Africa will require mor...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} {{adaptation}} of methodological approaches {{to the development of}} risk-based model of control and supervisory activities in such a big city as Moscow, it was found that a high density of population, a considerable mass of circulating consumer products, especially food products, large volumes of services rendered to the population by the specific legal entities or individual entrepreneurs, entail an increase of the risk of harm to the population by the individual economic entities and, accordingly, increase the class of object supervision compared with the class of similar objects in other areas. In the big city the proportion of objects that form the extremely high risks associated with the violation of the sanitary legislation is about 4 %, the proportion of high-risk sites – about 12 %, which is 2 – 2, 5 times higher than the average for the Russian Federation. This entails an increase in labor costs for each inspection and, <b>consequently,</b> increases <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> on supervisory authorities. However, according to a study more than 20 % of all objects of the capital city to be supervised form low population health risks for the citizens and can be removed from under routine surveillance.

40|$|Global {{investment}} in Medical Research and Development has markedly {{increased in the}} last few decades. However, due to the decreasing public altruism, researchers have come under increased pressures from the funding bodies to produce results. Out of desperation, some researchers have resorted to using incentives as a means of sourcing for volunteers. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>the</b> research <b>burden</b> has disproportionately been shared among the most vulnerable populations in the society. Incentives especially monetary ones present an ethical dilemma because of the uncertainties&# 146; surrounding the morality, amount and type of payment, vulnerability of volunteers and possible threats to voluntary participation. Several studies done on the use of incentives in medical research have noted that financial motivation was the number one reason for subjects to volunteer in Medical research. Mutual benefit and freedom of choice by participants were given as reasons to support their use. However, scientists who are against the use of incentives believe that they are coercive or undue inducements, and may influence a subjects&# 146; ability to give an informed consent. Guidelines exist that protect vulnerable groups from exploitation, although none sheds light into the use of incentives. Nonetheless, {{in the face of the}} waning public altruism, the benefits of using incentives far outweigh the dangers, although researchers should avoid situations where their use may become problematic. As a mode of payment to research subjects, researchers should adopt a combination of the Dickerts&# 146; Wage and re-imbursement models as guides in quantifying the incentive.
