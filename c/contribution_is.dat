5|$|Tristan Tzara was an {{influential}} author and performer, whose <b>contribution</b> <b>is</b> credited with having created a connection from Cubism and Futurism to the Beat Generation, Situationism and various currents in rock music.

5|$|Between them, the Harvey {{brothers}} totalled 25,185 runs in 772 appearances for the Fitzroy Cricket Club. Over time, {{their numbers}} in the ranks began to diminish. In 194950, Mick moved to Queensland while Harold was dropped from his position in the Fitzroy First XI. Merv retired after 1954-55 and Neil moved to New South Wales after 195657. Ray retired from the First XI {{at the end of}} 196061 and Brian the year after. In 1962-63, the club played their first season for 30 years without a Harvey in the team. At first-class level, the family's <b>contribution</b> <b>is</b> 26,532 in 405 appearances, with 7,964 coming for Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Eli Roth's <b>contribution</b> <b>is</b> a promo for the slasher opus Thanksgiving. Produced in {{the style}} of holiday-themed slasher films like Halloween, Silent Night, Deadly Night, April Fool's Day and My Bloody Valentine, the trailer starred Jeff Rendell as a killer who stalks victims while dressed as a pilgrim; Jordan Ladd, Jay Hernandez, and Roth himself as his {{intended}} victims; and Michael Biehn as the Sheriff. The design for the titles in Thanksgiving was based on a Mad magazine slasher parody titled Arbor Day. Excerpts of the score from Creepshow were used in the faux trailer.|$|E
5000|$|Non-concessional {{contributions}} (also {{referred to}} as [...] "undeducted" [...] or [...] "after-tax" [...] <b>contributions)</b> <b>are</b> <b>contributions</b> for which no-one has received a tax deduction.

5000|$|Contributions made to superannuation, {{either by}} an {{individual}} or on behalf of an individual, are taxed differently depending on whether that <b>contribution</b> <b>was</b> made from 'pre-tax' or 'post-tax' money. [...] "Pre-tax" [...] <b>contributions</b> <b>are</b> <b>contributions</b> on which no income tax has been paid at time of <b>contribution,</b> and <b>are</b> also known as [...] "before-tax" [...] contributions or as [...] "concessional" [...] contributions. They comprise mainly compulsory employer SG contributions and additional salary sacrifice <b>contributions.</b> These <b>contributions</b> <b>are</b> taxed by the superannuation fund at a [...] "contributions tax" [...] rate of 15%, which is regarded as [...] "concessional" [...] rate. For individuals who earn more than $300,000, the <b>contributions</b> tax <b>is</b> levied at 30%.|$|R
50|$|Category 3 - People aged between 20 and 60 {{years old}} who are {{dependent}} on Category 2 contributors. <b>Contributions</b> <b>are</b> waived for Category 3 members, as their <b>contributions</b> <b>are</b> subsidized by all Category 2 contributors.|$|R
5|$|Matching, also {{referred}} to as “cost sharing”, is a requirement for the recipient to provide contributions or donations (usually non-federal) of a specified amount or percentage to supplement federal assistance received. In other words, when the recipient participates in a federal program (e.g. it receives federal assistance) and an operating budget is prepared, the federal government may require the recipient to provide contributions to cover a portion of that program’s operations. The matching requirement is based on the assertion that total program expenses are 100% and that, although the federal government provides assistance for most of those expenses, the recipient must still cover a portion of them. Such proportion is solely decided by the federal government, but usually the recipient decides how that <b>contribution</b> <b>is</b> provided and to which expenses, so long as the <b>contribution</b> <b>is</b> verifiable, generally does not originate from another federal program, and is considered in the operating budget. The expenses must be necessary and reasonable, allowed under cost principles (see B section above), and not used for another federal program. Matching may be in the form of contributing the recipient’s own funds or money to suffrage program allowable costs (e.g., paying program utility bills, paying part of program personnel payroll, etc.) or, in some cases, in the form of in-kind contributions, which are donations of non-monetary objects such as services, materials, property, etc.|$|E
5|$|Schlosberg's <b>contribution,</b> <b>is,</b> in many ways, a {{response}} to challenges made to his Defining Environmental Justice (2007). Schlosberg aims to step beyond previous accounts of animal rights or environmentalism as requirements of justice by deploying a mixed capabilities/deliberation approach applicable to both ecosystems and nonhuman animals. Schlosberg challenges criticisms of his capabilities approach (specifically, a capabilities approach which moves beyond humans) grounded {{in the existence of}} conflicts of capabilities, claiming that a form of deliberative democracy can overcome the problem posed by these conflicts. His mixed account, he claims, provides a form of justice appropriate for thinking about human and nonhuman individuals and collectives in the Anthropocene.|$|E
5|$|Since 1900, {{the major}} taxonomic studies on Amphidromus have been {{faunistic}} (a {{study of the}} fauna of some territory or area) in scope. The papers of American malacologist Paul Bartsch (1917, 1918, 1919) on the Philippine species, Bernhard Rensch (1932) on the Lesser Sunda Islands forms, and Tera van Benthem Jutting (1950, 1959) on Javan and Sumatran populations are especially comprehensive. Potentially the most valuable <b>contribution</b> <b>is</b> that of Curt Haniel (1921), who discussed the variation within A. contrarius and A. reflexilabris on Timor; the variations in color and form were well illustrated {{in a series of}} color plates.|$|E

5|$|The group {{carried out}} their vocal overdubs during the {{afternoon}} of 18 October. Over the instrumental break and the outro, the harmonies consist of McCartney singing a third above and Lennon a tenth below Harrison's double-tracked lead vocal. During the same session, Ringo Starr added a tambourine part. Although some Beatles authors credit Martin as having played harmonium, Fontenot says this <b>contribution</b> <b>is</b> inaudible on the completed track. A mono mix of the song was made on 25 October, and a stereo mix on 26 October – the day the Beatles collected their MBEs from Buckingham Palace.|$|E

5000|$|Superannuation <b>contributions</b> <b>are</b> either {{concessional}} or non-concessional contributions. Concessional contributions (sometimes {{referred to}} as [...] "before-tax" [...] <b>contributions)</b> <b>are</b> <b>contributions</b> for which someone (such as an employer) has received a tax deduction. Concessional contributions include superannuation guarantee (SG) contributions, salary sacrifice contributions, other employer contributions and contributions claimed as a personal tax deduction. Concessional <b>contributions</b> <b>are</b> taxed in the fund. While taxable components do not change the tax payable by the superannuation fund, they may {{be a factor in}} calculating the tax payable on withdrawals from a super fund.|$|R
