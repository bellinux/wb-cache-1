5|$|A <b>contact</b> angle {{less than}} 90° (low <b>contact</b> angle) usually {{indicates}} that wetting {{of the surface}} is very favorable, and the fluid will spread over a large area of the surface. <b>Contact</b> angles greater than 90° (high <b>contact</b> angle) generally means that wetting of the surface is unfavorable, so the fluid will minimize <b>contact</b> with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet.|$|E

5|$|In simpler terms, <b>contact</b> angle {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially}} the displacement of a <b>contact</b> line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding <b>contact</b> angles. The advancing <b>contact</b> angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding <b>contact</b> angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable <b>contact</b> angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable <b>contact</b> angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

40|$|Background rVSV-ZEBOV is a recombinant, {{replication}} competent {{vesicular stomatitis}} virus-based candidate vaccine expressing a surface glycoprotein of Zaire Ebolavirus. We tested {{the effect of}} rVSV-ZEBOV in preventing Ebola virus disease in <b>contacts</b> and <b>contacts</b> of <b>contacts</b> of recently confirmed cases in Guinea, west Africa. Findings In the randomised part of the trial we identified 4539 <b>contacts</b> and <b>contacts</b> of <b>contacts</b> in 51 clusters randomly assigned to immediate vaccination (of whom 3232 were eligible, 2151 consented, and 2119 were immediately vaccinated) and 4557 <b>contacts</b> and <b>contacts</b> of <b>contacts</b> in 47 clusters randomly assigned to delayed vaccination (of whom 3096 were eligible, 2539 consented, and 2041 were vaccinated 21 days after randomisation). No cases of Ebola virus disease occurred 10 days or more after randomisation among randomly assigned <b>contacts</b> and <b>contacts</b> of <b>contacts</b> vaccinated in immediate clusters versus 16 cases (7 clusters affected) among all eligible individuals in delayed clusters. Vaccine efficacy was 100 % (95 % CI 68 · 9 – 100 · 0, p= 0 · 0045), and the calculated intraclass correlation coefficient was 0 · 035. Additionally, we defined 19 non-randomised clusters in which we enumerated 2745 <b>contacts</b> and <b>contacts</b> of <b>contacts,</b> 2006 of whom were eligible and 1677 were immediately vaccinated, including 194 children. The evidence from all 117 clusters showed that no cases of Ebola virus disease occurred 10 days or more after randomisation among all immediately vaccinated <b>contacts</b> and <b>contacts</b> of <b>contacts</b> versus 23 cases (11 clusters affected) among all eligible <b>contacts</b> and <b>contacts</b> of <b>contacts</b> in delayed plus all eligible <b>contacts</b> and <b>contacts</b> of <b>contacts</b> never vaccinated in immediate clusters. The estimated vaccine efficacy here was 100 % (95 % CI 79 · 3 – 100 · 0, p= 0 · 0033). 52 % of <b>contacts</b> and <b>contacts</b> of <b>contacts</b> assigned to immediate vaccination and in non-randomised clusters received the vaccine immediately; vaccination protected both vaccinated and unvaccinated people in those clusters. 5837 individuals in total received the vaccine (5643 adults and 194 children), and all vaccinees were followed up for 84 days. 3149 (53 · 9 %) of 5837 individuals reported at least one adverse event in the 14 days after vaccination; these were typically mild (87 · 5 % of all 7211 adverse events). Headache (1832 [25 · 4 %]), fatigue (1361 [18 · 9 %]), and muscle pain (942 [13 · 1 %]) were the most commonly reported adverse events in this period across all age groups. 80 serious adverse events were identified, of which two were judged {{to be related to}} vaccination (one febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one possibly related (influenza-like illness); all three recovered without sequelae...|$|R
5|$|Such {{motion of}} a phase boundary, {{involving}} advancing and receding <b>contact</b> angles, {{is known as}} dynamic wetting. When a <b>contact</b> line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, the <b>contact</b> angle is increased and generally {{is related to the}} velocity of the <b>contact</b> line. If the velocity of a <b>contact</b> line is increased without bound, the <b>contact</b> angle increases, and as it approaches 180°, the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from the <b>contact</b> line moving at such a high speed that complete wetting cannot occur.|$|E
5|$|The <b>contact</b> angle (θ), {{as seen in}} Figure 1, is {{the angle}} at which the liquid–vapor {{interface}} meets the solid-liquid interface. The <b>contact</b> angle {{is determined by the}} result between adhesive and cohesive forces. As the tendency of a drop to spread out over a flat, solid surface increases, the <b>contact</b> angle decreases. Thus, the <b>contact</b> angle provides an inverse measure of wettability.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} {{astronomer}} Steven J.

Seeing radio-based <b>contact</b> as a more plausible scenario than a visit from extraterrestrial spacecraft, the study rejects the commonly stated analogy of European colonization of the Americas as an accurate model for information-only <b>contact,</b> preferring events of profound scientific significance, such as the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions, as more predictive of how humanity might be impacted by extraterrestrial <b>contact.</b>|$|E

5|$|An ideal {{surface is}} flat, rigid, {{perfectly}} smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero <b>contact</b> angle hysteresis. Zero hysteresis implies the advancing and receding <b>contact</b> angles are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable <b>contact</b> angle exists. When {{a drop of}} liquid is placed on such a surface, the characteristic <b>contact</b> angle is formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed. The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Another {{special case}} {{is where the}} <b>contact</b> angle is exactly 180°. Water with {{specially}} prepared Teflon approaches this. <b>Contact</b> angle of 180° occurs when the liquid–solid surface tension is exactly equal to the liquid–air surface tension.|$|E
5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the <b>contact</b> patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the <b>contact</b> patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} <b>contact</b> patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the <b>contact</b> patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E
40|$|Electrical <b>contacts</b> {{are usually}} plated {{in order to}} prevent corrosion. Platings of {{detachable}} electrical <b>contacts</b> experience wear because of the motion between <b>contacts.</b> Once the protecting platings have been worn out, electrical <b>contacts</b> will fail rapidly due to corrosion or fretting corrosion. Therefore the wear resistance of the platings is a very important parameter for the long lifetime of electrical <b>contacts.</b> Many measures which improve the wear resistance can diminish the conductivity of the platings. Due to the fact that platings of electrical <b>contacts</b> must have both a high wear resistance and a high electrical conductivity, the manufacturing of high performance platings of electrical <b>contacts</b> poses a great challenge. Our study shows firstly the correlation between the wear resistance of platings and lifetime of electrical <b>contacts</b> and then the measures, which improve the wear resistance without impairing the electrical performance of the <b>contacts...</b>|$|R
