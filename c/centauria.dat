25|$|Also, {{if another}} similar planet orbited at 0.71AU from Alpha CentauriB (so {{that in turn}} Alpha Centauri B {{appeared}} as bright as the Sun seen from the Earth), this hypothetical planet would receive slightly more light from the more luminous Alpha <b>CentauriA,</b> which would shine 4.7 to 7.3 magnitudes dimmer than Alpha CentauriB (or the Sun seen from the Earth), ranging in apparent magnitude between −19.4 (dimmest) and −22.1 (brightest). Thus Alpha <b>CentauriA</b> would appear between 830 and 70 times dimmer than the Sun but some 580 to 6900 times brighter than the full Moon. During the orbital period of such a planet of 0.6(3) a, an observer on the planet would see this intensely bright companion star circle the sky just as humans see with the Solar System's planets. Furthermore, Alpha CentauriA's sidereal period of approximately eighty years means that this star would move through the local ecliptic as slowly as Uranus with its eighty-four year period, but as the orbit of Alpha <b>CentauriA</b> is more elliptical, its apparent magnitude will be far more variable. Although intensely bright to the eye, the overall illumination would not significantly affect climate nor influence normal plant photosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|For example, some {{theoretical}} planet orbiting about 1.25 AU from Alpha <b>CentauriA</b> (so {{that the}} star appears roughly {{as bright as}} the Sun viewed from the Earth) would see Alpha CentauriB orbit the entire sky once roughly every one year and three months (or 1.3(4) a), the planet's own orbital period. Added to {{this would be the}} changing apparent position of Alpha CentauriB during its long eighty-year elliptical orbit with respect to Alpha <b>CentauriA.</b> (The average speed, at 4.5 degrees per Earth year, is comparable in speed to Uranus here. With the eccentricity of the orbit, the maximum speed near periapse, about 18 degrees per Earth year, is faster than Saturn, but slower than Jupiter. The minimum speed near apoapse, about 1.8 degrees per Earth year, is slower than Neptune.) Depending on its and the planet's position on their respective orbits, Alpha Centauri B would vary in apparent magnitude between −18.2 (dimmest) and −21.0 (brightest). These visual apparent magnitudes are much dimmer than the apparent magnitude of the Sun as viewed from the Earth (−26.7). The difference of 5.7 to 8.6 magnitudes means Alpha CentauriB would appear, on a linear scale, 2500 to 190 times dimmer than Alpha <b>CentauriA</b> (or the Sun viewed from the Earth), but also 190 to 2500 times brighter than the full Moon as seen from the Earth (−12.5).|$|E
25|$|To {{be in the}} star's {{habitable}} zone, any suspected planet around Alpha <b>CentauriA</b> {{would have}} to be optimally placed about 1.25AU away – about halfway between the distances of Earth's orbit and Mars's orbit in the Solar System– so as to have similar planetary temperatures and conditions for liquid water to exist. For the slightly less luminous and cooler Alpha CentauriB, the habitable zone would lie closer at about , approximately the distance that Venus is from the Sun.|$|E
25|$|In the Solar System both Jupiter and Saturn were {{probably}} crucial in perturbing comets {{into the inner}} Solar System. Here, the comets provided the inner planets with their own source of water and various other ices. In the Alpha Centauri system, Proxima Centauri may have influenced the planetary disk as the Alpha Centauri system was forming, enriching the area around Alpha Centauri A and B with volatile materials. This would be discounted if, for example, Alpha CentauriB happened to have gas giants orbiting Alpha <b>CentauriA</b> (or conversely, Alpha <b>CentauriA</b> for Alpha CentauriB), or if the stars B and A themselves were able to perturb comets into each other's inner system as Jupiter and Saturn presumably {{have done in the}} Solar System. Such icy bodies probably also reside in Oort clouds of other planetary systems, when they are influenced gravitationally by either the gas giants or disruptions by passing nearby stars many of these icy bodies then travel starwards. There is no direct evidence yet of the existence of such an Oort cloud around Alpha CentauriAB, and theoretically this may have been totally destroyed during the system's formation.|$|E
25|$|An {{observer}} on {{a hypothetical}} planet orbiting around either Alpha <b>CentauriA</b> or Alpha CentauriB {{would see the}} other star of the binary system as an intensely bright object in the night sky, showing a small but discernible disk while near periapse: A up to 210 arc seconds, B up to 155 arc seconds. Near apoapse, the disc would shrink to 60 arc seconds for A, 43 arc seconds for B, being too small to resolve by naked eye. In any case, the dazzling surface brightness could make the discs harder to resolve than a similarly sized less bright object.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of planets orbiting other star systems, including similar binary systems (Gamma Cephei), {{raises the possibility}} that additional planets may exist in the Alpha Centauri system. Such planets could orbit Alpha <b>CentauriA</b> or Alpha CentauriB individually, or be on large orbits around the binary Alpha Centauri AB. Because both the principal stars are fairly similar to the Sun (for example, in age and metallicity), astronomers have been especially interested in making detailed searches for planets in the Alpha Centauri system. Several established planet-hunting teams have used various radial velocity or star transit methods in their searches around these two bright stars. All the observational studies have so far failed to find any evidence for brown dwarfs or gas giants.|$|E
2500|$|Alpha Centauri A, {{also known}} as Rigil Kentaurus, is the {{principal}} member, or primary, of the binary system, being slightly larger and more luminous than the Sun. It is a solar-like main-sequence star with a similar yellowish colour, whose stellar classification is spectral type G2V. From the determined mutual orbital parameters, Alpha <b>CentauriA</b> is about 10 percent more massive than the Sun, with a radius about 22 percent larger. The projected rotational velocity [...] of this star is , resulting in an estimated rotational period of 22days, which gives it a slightly faster rotational period than the Sun's 25 days. When considered among the individual brightest {{stars in the sky}} (excluding the Sun), Alpha <b>CentauriA</b> is the fourth brightest at an apparent visual magnitude of +0.01, being fractionally fainter than Arcturus at an apparent visual magnitude of −0.04.|$|E
2500|$|Alpha Centauri is {{the name}} given to what appears as a single star {{to the naked eye}} and the {{brightest}} star in the southern constellation of Centaurus. At −0.27 apparent visual magnitude (calculated from A and B magnitudes), it is fainter only than Sirius and Canopus. The next-brightest star in the night sky is Arcturus. Alpha Centauri is a multiple-star system, with its two main stars being Alpha <b>CentauriA</b> [...] and Alpha CentauriB , usually defined to identify them as the different components of the binary [...] A third companion—Proxima Centauri (or Proxima or [...] )—is much further away than the distance between stars A andB, but is still gravitationally associated with the AB system. As viewed from Earth, it is located at an angular separation of 2.2° from the two main stars. Proxima Centauri would appear to the naked eye as a separate star from [...] if it were bright enough to be seen without a telescope. Alpha CentauriAB and Proxima Centauri form a visual double star. Together, the three components make a triple star system, referred to by double-star observers as the triple star (or multiple star), [...]|$|E
2500|$|Assuming this {{hypothetical}} planet had a low {{orbital inclination}} {{with respect to}} the mutual orbit of Alpha <b>CentauriA</b> and B, then the secondary star would start beside the primary at [...] "stellar" [...] conjunction. Half the period later, at [...] "stellar" [...] opposition, both stars would be opposite each other in the sky. As a net result, both the local sun and the other star would each be in the sky for half a day, like Sun and Moon are both above the horizon for half a day. But during stellar conjunction, the other star being [...] "new" [...] would be in the sky during daytime, while during the opposition, the other star being [...] "full" [...] would be in the sky for the whole night. In an Earth-like atmosphere, the light of the other star would be appreciably scattered, causing the sky to be perceptibly blue though darker than during daytime, like during twilight or total solar eclipse. Humans could easily walk around and clearly see the surrounding terrain, and reading a book would be quite possible without any artificial light. Over the following half period, the secondary star would be in the sky for a progressively decreasing part of the night (and an increasing part of the day) until at the next conjunction the secondary star would only be in the sky during daytime near the primary star.|$|E

40|$|We {{carried out}} a {{quantitative}} assessment of the consumption of herbaceous plants by Opatrum sabulosum (Linnaeus, 1761) – a highly significant agricultural pest species. We researched the feeding preferences of this pest species with respect to 33 uncultivated and 22 cultivated plant species. This species of darkling beetle feeds on many uncultivated plant species, including those with hairy leaves and bitter milky sap, such as Scabiosa ucrainca (5. 21 mg/specimen/ 24 hours), Euphorbia virgata (3. 45), Solanum nigrum (3. 32), <b>Centauria</b> scabiosa (2. 47), Lamium album (2. 41), Aristolochia clematitis (1. 76), Chenopodium album (1. 73), Arctium lappa (1. 51), Asperula odorata (1. 20). A high rate of leaf consumption is also characteristic for cultivated species, for example, Perilla nankinensis (5. 05 mg/specimen/ 24 hours), Lycopersicon esculentum (3. 75), Tropaeolum majus (3. 29), Nicotiana tabacum (2. 66), Rumex acetosa (1. 96), Beta vulgaris (1. 27). O. sabulosum is capable of feeding on plants which are poisonous to cattle.
