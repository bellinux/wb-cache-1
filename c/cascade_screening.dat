40|$|Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder {{mainly caused by}} mutations in the LDLR gene, resulting in elevated serum cholesterol levels and elevated risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Timely treatment with lipid lowering medication can {{lower the risk of}} CVD to the same level of the normal population. Currently the incidence of FH is estimated at 1 in 240 persons in the Caucasian population. A diagnosis of FH can be {{made on the basis of}} clinical criteria (including LDL cholesterol and family history) or DNA testing. When a mutation is known within a family an unequivocal diagnosis can be made by DNA testing in family members at any age. Genetic <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> is a cost-effective way to identify patients and prevent CVD. Between 1994 until 2014 a nationwide and government subsidized <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> program functioned to identify FH patients in the Netherlands. During this time more than 28, 000 patients with FH have been identified and entered in a central, national database. Since 2014 <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> has been integrated in the regular Dutch health care system. Screening, counseling and treatment are now integrated in the care as a whole of FH patients and families, coordinated by the treating physician, while the national FH database is still maintained. However, since <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> by actively approaching family members cannot be applied anymore because of new regulations within the healthcare system, the number of family members participating in the <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> program, has plummeted. With this review we would like to highlight the practical consequences of implementing and executing a <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> program with a special focus on the lessons learned in the Netherlands.

40|$|Objectives: {{to compare}} the effectiveness, {{estimate}} the associated costs, and summarise available evidence about the feasibility and acceptability of different screening strategies in England and Wales. Also to establish a model for estimating effectiveness and costs of these different strategies. Data sources: literature searches were restricted to MEDLINE and EMBASE, as well as citations in included papers. A broad search strategy was used involving all aspects of fragile X syndrome (FXS) and covered all relevant literature published between 1991 and 2001. Review methods: an assessment was conducted of published literature and efforts focused {{on the development of}} a model {{that could be used to}} synthesise data from various sources, estimate cost-effectiveness of different strategies, and conduct sensitivity analyses according to different assumptions. Results: the identified screening programmes were effective in detecting carriers, but a comparison of different strategies was not possible. Simulation results by the FXS Model showed that, over the first 10 years, 4 % of premutation (PM) females and 70 % of full mutation (FM) females could be detected by active cascade screening; it is 10 % and 58 %, respectively, by prenatal screening. The maximal detection rate for FM carriers by active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> is higher than that by prenatal screening (91 % versus 71 %). However, the maximal rate of detection of female PM carriers by active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> (6 %) is much lower than that by prenatal screening (60 %). During the first 10 years of simulation, the estimated direct cost per year to the NHS in England and Wales is 0. 7 - 0. 2 million pounds sterling by active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> and 14. 5 - 9. 1 million pounds sterling by a programme of prenatal screening. The incremental cost per extra carrier detected (using current practice as the reference standard) is on average only 165 pounds sterling by active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> and 7543 pounds sterling by prenatal screening. The incremental cost per FXS birth avoided is on average 8494 pounds sterling by active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> and 284, 779 pounds sterling by prenatal screening. Conclusions: the empirical evidence suggests that both prenatal screening and <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> are feasible and acceptable. Population-based prenatal screening is more efficacious, but it will cost more than active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening.</b> The active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> of affected families is more efficient, cheaper, but less effective than a population-based prenatal screening. It is suggested that both strategies be evaluated in large-scale trials, which might also help to determine whether and how the different strategies could be simultaneously or sequentially combine...|$|E
40|$|Screening {{for genetic}} {{variants}} that predispose individuals or their offspring to disease may be {{performed at the}} general population level or may instead be targeted at the relatives of previously identified carriers. The latter strategy {{has come to be}} known as “cascade genetic screening. ” Since the carrier risk of close relatives of known carriers is generally higher than the population risk, <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> is more efficient than population screening, in the sense that fewer individuals have to be genotyped per detected carrier. The efficacy of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening,</b> as measured by the overall proportion of carriers detected in a given population, is, however, lower than that of population-wide screening, and the respective inclusion rates vary according to the population frequency and mode of inheritance of the predisposing variants. For dominant mutations, we have developed equations that allow the inclusion rates of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> to be calculated in an iterative fashion, depending upon screening depth and penetrance. For recessive mutations, we derived only equations for the screening of siblings and the children of patients. Owing to their mathematical complexity, it was necessary to study more extended screening strategies by simulation. <b>Cascade</b> <b>screening</b> turned out to result in low inclusion rates (< 1 %) when aimed at the identification of heterozygous carriers of rare recessive variants. Considerably higher rates are achievable, however, when screening is performed to detect covert homozygotes for frequent recessive mutations with reduced penetrance. This situation is exemplified by hereditary hemochromatosis, for which up to 40 % of at-risk individuals may be identifiable through screening of first- to third-degree relatives of overt carriers (i. e., patients); the efficiency of this screening strategy was found to be ∼ 50 times higher than that of population-wide screening. For dominant mutations, inclusion rates of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> were estimated to be higher than for recessive variants. Thus, some 80 % of all carriers of the factor V Leiden mutation would be detected if screening were to be targeted specifically at first- to third-degree relatives of patients with venous thrombosis. The relative cost efficiency of cascade as compared with population-wide screening (i. e., the overall savings in the extra managerial cost of the condition) is also likely to be higher for dominant than for recessive mutations. This notwithstanding, once screening has become cost-effective at the population level, it can be expected that <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> would only transiently represent an economically viable option...|$|E

40|$|Cascade testing or {{screening}} {{provides an}} important mechanism for identifying {{people at risk}} of a genetic condition. For some autosomal dominant conditions, such as Familial Hpercholesterolaemia (FH), identifying relatives allows for significant health-affecting interventions to be administered, which can extend a person’s life expectancy significantly. However, <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> is not without ethical implications. In this paper, we examine one ethically contentious aspect of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> programmes, namely the alternative methods by which relatives of a proband can be contacted. Should the proband be responsible for contacting {{his or her family}} members, or should the screening programme contact family members directly? We argue that direct contact is an ethically justifiable method of contact tracing in <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> for FH. Not only has this method of contact already been utilised without adverse effects, an examination of the ethical arguments against it shows these are unsubstantiated.

40|$|Familial DNA <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> for {{familial}} hypercholesterolemia (FH) {{has recently been}} introduced in Scotland. This study investigated index patients' experiences of DNA testing and mediating <b>cascade</b> <b>screening.</b> Thirty-eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of definite or possible FH who had undergone DNA testing in the lipid clinic took part in semi-structured qualitative interviews. All patients were positive about DNA screening being undertaken by familiar and trusted clinicians within the lipid clinic. Most patients had already cascaded close relatives for serum cholesterol testing following their attendance at the lipid clinic. Identified mutation carriers who had attended the genetics clinic (n[*]=[*] 15) for a cascading appointment described finding this consultation helpful because it identified other at-risk family members and provided them with tailored information for their relatives. Participants who expressed a preference said they favoured indirect (patient-mediated) methods of cascading as they considered indirect approaches to be less threatening to family members than direct clinical contact. We conclude that DNA screening and indirect familial cascading is perceived as highly acceptable to index patients with FH. However, while indirect cascading methods may be more acceptable to patients, they do not yield the same numbers as more direct methods. There is, therefore, a need for further systematic research to investigate patients', family members' and staff views of the acceptability of direct versus indirect methods of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening...</b>|$|E

However, large scale genetic <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> for FH showed that 15 % of the LDL-receptor (LDLR) or Apolipoprotein B (APOB) mutation carriers have LDL-C levels below P 75. Non-pathogenicity of sequence changes may explain this phenomenon. Methods: To assess pathogenicity of a mutation we proposed three criteria: 1) mean LDL-C >P 75 in untreated mutation carriers; 2) higher mean LDL-C level in untreated carriers than in untreated non-carriers; and 3) {{higher percentage of}} medication users in carriers than in non-carriers at screening. We considered a mutation non-pathogenic when {{none of the three}} criteria were met. We applied these criteria to mutations that had been determined in more than 50 untreated adults.

Study design Questionnaires covering topics such as demographics, family history, physician consultation, and treatment were sent to parents of patients with FH (age 0 - 18 years), 18 months after diagnosis. Results We retrieved 207 questionnaires of patients aged 10. 9 +/- 4. 2 years (mean +/- SD) at diagnosis; 48 % were boys, and the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at diagnosis was 167 +/- 51 mg/dL. Of these patients, 164 (79 %) consulted a physician: a general practitioner (35 %), lipid-clinic specialist (27 %), pediatrician (21 %), internist (11 %), or another physician (6 %). LDL-C level at diagnosis and a positive family history for cardiovascular disease were independent predictors for physician consultation. Of the patients who visited a physician, 62 % reported to have received lifestyle advice, and 43 (26 %) were prescribed statin treatment. Independent predictors for medication use were age, LDL-C level, and educational level of parents.

40|$|Background: Familial {{hypercholesterolemia}} (FH) is {{a serious}} genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in every 300 to 500 individuals and is characterised by excessively high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, substantially increased risk of early-onset coronary heart disease (CHD) and premature mortality. If FH is untreated, it leads to a greater than 50 % risk of CHD in men {{by the age of}} 50 and at least 30 % in women by the age of 60. FH can be diagnosed through genetic screening and effectively managed through pharmacological treatment and lifestyle changes. Purpose: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic health condition that increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although FH can be effectively managed with appropriate pharmacological and dietary interventions, FH detection rate through genetic screening remains low. The present study explored perceptions and experiences of FH patients (N = 18) involved in a genetic <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> programme. Methods: Face-to-face interviews were conducted to assess patients’ knowledge and understanding of FH, explore factors linked to adherence to health-protective behaviours and examine perceptions of genetic screening. Results: Thematic analysis of interviews revealed four themes: disease knowledge, severity of FH, lifestyle behavioural change and barriers to <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> and treatment. Participants recognised FH as a permanent, genetic condition that increased their risk of CHD and premature mortality. Many participants dismissed the seriousness of FH and the importance of lifestyle changes because they perceived it to be effectively managed through medication. Despite positive attitudes toward screening, many participants reported that relatives were reluctant to attend screening due to their relatives’ ‘fatalistic’ outlook or low motivation. Participants believed that they had insufficient authority or control to persuade family members to attend screening and welcomed greater hospital assistance for contact with relatives. Conclusions: Findings support the adoption of direct methods of recruitment to <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> led by medical professionals, who were perceived as having greater authority. Other implications included the need for clinicians to provide clear information, particularly to those who are asymptomatic, related to the seriousness of FH and the necessity for adherence to medication and lifestyle changes.

To improve identification of this under-diagnosed disease, experts suggested raising the age limit for CRC tumour genetic testing from 50 to 70 years. The present study evaluates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this strategy. METHODS: Probabilistic efficacy and cost-effectiveness analyses were carried out comparing tumour genetic testing of CRC diagnosed at age 70 or below (experimental strategy) versus CRC diagnosed at age 50 or below (current practice). The proportions of LS patients identified and cost-effectiveness including <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> of relatives, were calculated by decision analytic models based on real-life data. RESULTS: Using the experimental strategy, four times more LS patients can be identified among CRC patients when compared with current practice.

A recent survey commissioned by the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) reported a lack of awareness of FH in the general population.

Methods A survey designed to assess knowledge of diagnostic criteria, risk assessment, the role of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening,</b> and management options for patients with FH was distributed to 1000 healthcare professionals (response rate 44. 3 %).

Similarly, just 65. 9 % were aware of recommendations regarding <b>cascade</b> <b>screening.</b> Conclusions The prevalence and associated risk of FH continue to be underestimated, and knowledge of diagnostic criteria and treatment options is suboptimal. These results support the recent Consensus Statement of the EAS and production of quality standards by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Further work is required to formulate interventions to improve FH awareness and knowledge, and to determine the effect these interventions have on patient outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and objectives: Catecholaminergic {{polymorphic}} {{ventricular tachycardia}} is a malignant disease, due to mutations in proteins controlling Ca 2 + homeostasis. While the phenotype {{is characterized by}} polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias under stress, supraventricular arrhythmias may occur and are not fully characterized. Methods: Twenty-five relatives from a Spanish family with several sudden deaths were evaluated with electrocardiogram, exercise testing, and optional epinephrine challenge. Selective RyR 2 sequencing in an affected individual and <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> {{in the rest of}} the family was offered. The RyR 2 R 420 Q mutation was generated in HEK- 293 cells using site-directed mutagenesis to conduct in vitro functional studies. Results: The exercise testing unmasked catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in 8 relatives (sensitivity = 89...|$|E
40|$|Hypercholesterolemia is an {{important}} cardiovascular risk (CV) factor that can be due to environmental or genetic causes. Identification of a young population with high CV risk allows early intervention and prevention, delaying or abolishing occurrence of CHD in adult life. Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is associated with major risk of CV events and usually results from mutations in three different genes involved in lipid metabolism such as LDLR, APOB and PCSK 9 genes. The Portuguese FH Study is established in the National Institute of Health, Lisbon, since 1999 where the biochemical characterization and DNA diagnosis have been performed for patients with clinical diagnosis of FH and <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> in relatives of the affected index patients...|$|E
40|$|Identifying small {{molecules}} that induce {{the disruption of}} constitutive protein-protein interfaces is a challenging objective. Here, a targeted biophysical <b>screening</b> <b>cascade</b> was employed to specifically identify {{small molecules}} that could disrupt the constitutive, homodimeric protein-protein interface within CK 2 β. This approach could potentially be applied to achieve subunit disassembly of other homo-oligomeric proteins {{as a means of}} modulating protein function.

40|$|Arrhythmogenic right {{ventricular}} cardiomyopathy {{is a rare}} inherited heart-muscle {{disease that}} is a cause of sudden death in young people and athletes. Causative mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins have been identified and the disease is nowadays regarded as a genetically determined myocardial dystrophy. The left ventricle is so frequently involved as to support {{the adoption of the}} broad term arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Clinical diagnosis can be achieved by demonstrating function and structure changes of the right ventricle, electrocardiogram depolarisation and repolarisation abnormalities, ventricular arrhythmias, and fibrofatty replacement through endomyocardial biopsy. Although specific, the standardised diagnostic criteria lack sensitivity for early disease and their primary application remains in establishing the diagnosis in probands. However, the main clinical targets are early detection of concealed forms and risk stratification for preventive strategies, which include physical exercise restriction, antiarrhythmic drugs, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy. <b>Cascade</b> genetic <b>screening</b> of family members of gene-positive probands allows the identification of asymptomatic carriers who would require lifelong follow-up due to the age-related penetrance...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} target human-mosquito {{parasite}} transmission challenges global malaria elimination. However, {{it is not}} obvious what a transmission-blocking drug will look like; should it 1) target only parasite transmission stages; 2) be combined with a partner drug killing the pathogenic asexual stages or 3) kill both the sexual and asexual blood stages, preferably displaying polypharmacology. The development of transmission-blocking anti-malarials requires objective analyses of the current strategies. Here, pertinent issues and unanswered questions regarding the target candidate profile of a transmission-blocking compound, {{and its role in}} malaria elimination strategies are highlighted and novel perspectives proposed. The essential role of a test <b>cascade</b> that integrates <b>screening</b> and validation strategies to identify next generation transmission-blocking anti-malarials is emphasised. Koen Dechering (TROPIQ, The Netherlands), Francesco Silvestrini (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy), Sarah D’Alessandro and Donatella Taramelli (University of Milan, Italy), Robert Sauerwein (University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands) and Omar Vandal (The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) are acknowledged for their contributions towards the <b>screening</b> <b>cascade,</b> which they developed {{in the course of the}} Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Project OPP 1040394 ‘Gametocyte Assays for Malaria (GAM) for novel transmission blocking drugs’, coordinated by PA.
