40|$|Assessing the {{accuracy}} of predictive models is critical because predictive models have been increasingly used across various disciplines and predictive accuracy determines the quality of resultant predictions. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r) and the coefficient of determination (r 2) {{are among the most}} widely used measures for assessing predictive models for numerical data, although they are argued to be biased, insufficient and misleading. In this study, geometrical graphs were used to illustrate what were used in the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>r</b> and r 2 and simulations were used to demonstrate the behaviour of r and r 2 and to compare three accuracy measures under various scenarios. Relevant confusions about r and r 2, has been clarified. The <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>r</b> and r 2 is not based on the differences between the predicted and observed values. The existing error measures suffer various limitations and are unable to tell {{the accuracy}}. Variance explained by predictive models based on cross-validation (VEcv) is free of these limitations and is a reliable accuracy measure. Legates and McCabe's efficiency (E 1) is also an alternative accuracy measure. The r and r 2 do not measure the accuracy and are incorrect accuracy measures. The existing error measures suffer limitations. VEcv and E 1 are recommended for assessing the accuracy. The applications of these accuracy measures would encourage accuracy-improved predictive models to be developed to generate predictions for evidence-informed decision-making...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) {{experiment}} {{is widely used}} to quantitatively analyse the effects of chemical exchange on NMR spectra. In a CPMG experiment, the effective transverse relaxation rate, R 2,eff, is typically measured {{as a function of}} the pulse frequency, νCPMG. Here, an exact expression for how R 2,eff varies with νCPMG is derived for the commonly encountered scenario of two-site chemical exchange of in-phase magnetisation. This result, summarised in Appendix A, generalises a frequently used equation derived by Carver and Richards, published in 1972. The expression enables more rapid analysis of CPMG data by both speeding up <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>R</b> 2,eff over numerical methods by a factor of ca. 130, and yields exact derivatives for use in data analysis.

30|$|The {{consequences}} {{of the lack of}} compliance with species material balance by the BO PVT formulation become especially exacerbated during the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rs,</b> where physically negated negative values can be found (see Table  1). This is caused by the overestimation of Nfo, described above, compounded with an underestimation of Gfo. BO PVT property prediction algorithms preserve total amount of total surface gas (Gfg + Gfo + Gp), in spite of it being an increasing quantity as pressure depletes due to the volatilization of liquid intermediates. This leads to a consistent underestimation of Gfo based on such material balance constraint that uses Gfg and Gp values independently obtained from CVD data. The combination of underestimated Gfo values with overestimated Nfo values can translate into seriously underestimated Rs, (see Rs definition in Fig.  1 and calculated values in Table  1, with estimation errors higher than 200  %). This underestimation can be so severe that negative values <b>of</b> <b>Rs</b> can be found at low pressures—for this case, for pressures below 800  psia. At pressures below 800  psia, the sum of Gfg and Gp becomes higher than total surface gas (Gfg + Gfo + Gp) at dew point pressure leading to negative Rs values. It should be noted that Nfo and Gfo values do not participate in the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> Bg and Rv (see Fig.  1), and thus errors in their estimation do not impact Bg and Rv calculations.|$|R

ET o is calculated following the method of Hargreaves (HG) from a dense database of meteorological stations in the northernmost semi-arid region of Europe, the Ebro valley. The HG method requires the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> estimates <b>of</b> extraterrestrial radiation (<b>R</b> a).

We also compared possible propagations of errors in the map calculations for maps derived from modelled layers of maximum and minimum temperatures with those modelled using previously determined local ET o calculations. We demonstrate that <b>calculations</b> <b>of</b> <b>R</b> a from a DTM and GIS modelling provide a more realistic spatial distribution of ET o than those derived by only considering latitude. It is also preferable to model in advance the variables involved in the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> ET o (temperature and R a) and to subsequently calculate ET o by means of layer algebra in the GIS rather than directly model the local ET o calculations.

40|$|Summary. [...] The {{purpose of}} this paper is to fred a sound {{approach}} to the problem of the theoretical prediction of sectional characteristics taking account of the boundary layer. Attention is mainly concentrated on the lift, since it is on the accuracy <b>of</b> this <b>calculation</b> that the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>calculations</b> for other characteristics such as pressure distribution and moments must depend. <b>Calculations</b> <b>of</b> the lift and of the velocity at the edge of the boundary layer near tile trailing edge have been made for two dissimilar symmetrical aerofoils at an incidence of 6 deg, using boundary-layer data taken from experiment. Tile method <b>of</b> <b>calculation</b> satisfies the fundamental theorem that no net vorticity is discharged into tile wake at the trailing edge and in contrast to tile earlier <b>calculations</b> <b>of</b> <b>R.</b> & M. 1996, full account is now taken of the effect of the boundary layer on the velocity field outside tile boundary layer, so that tile empiricism of that report is avoided. Tile presentcalculations harmonise tile two different methods of approach which have been used in the past, namely, the one in which tile loss of lift below tile Joukowski value was attributed entirely to the incidence and camber effects of the boundary layer, and the other in which the vorticity theorem was satisfied, but boundary-layer camber effects were ignored.
