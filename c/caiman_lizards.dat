2500|$|The Tropical Realm is {{also the}} centre of the reptile collection. The {{crocodile}} pools (which formerly housed West African dwarf crocodiles, American alligators and Philippine crocodiles) currently house spectacled caimans in one and white-winged wood ducks and a yellow-Faced myna in the other. Near the entrance is an enclosure for tuataras. This lizard-like species from New Zealand is the last surviving sphenodont, a prehistoric group of reptiles, and Chester is the only British zoo to exhibit them. In February 2016, a tuatara hatched for the first time outside of New Zealand, leading Chester Zoo to be the only zoo to have bred them anywhere else. There were many varieties of snakes and lizards in the past (many had to depart as a result) emerald tree boas and Moellendorf's Ratsnakes now being the only remaining. The lizard collection is now made up of Serrated Casquehead Iguanas, Graham's Anoles, Jamaican Anoles, <b>caiman</b> <b>lizards,</b> and a Parson's chameleon.|$|E

5000|$|The genus Dracaena (romanized {{form of the}} Ancient Greek δράκαινα - drakaina, [...] "female dragon"), {{also called}} <b>caiman</b> <b>lizards</b> or water tegu, is in the teiid family, along with tegus and ameivas. <b>Caiman</b> <b>lizards</b> are found in South America in Ecuador, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru and Brazil. These lizards {{spend a lot of}} time in the water and they inhabit marshes, streams and flooded forests. <b>Caiman</b> <b>lizards</b> often bask on {{branches}} overhanging the water.|$|E
50|$|<b>Caiman</b> <b>lizards</b> {{are kept}} in private collections, {{but they are not}} yet kept in large numbers due to their {{tendency}} to only accept snails, and their high price. Additionally, <b>caiman</b> <b>lizards</b> are arboreal, aquatic, and burrowing, so suitable enclosures are usually only made by zoos. <b>Caiman</b> <b>lizards</b> born in captivity have been known to take a variety of food items, including snails, fish, cat food, and crustaceans. Their temperament is comparable to that of a tegu.|$|E

50|$|The <b>caiman</b> <b>lizard</b> {{is built}} {{similarly}} to its cousin the tegu, {{with a large}} heavy set body and short but powerful limbs. Its head is bulky and often a red or orange color. Their jaws are heavily muscular to help aid in eating its normal prey of snails, crawfish and fresh water clams. It also has a few adaptaions that help it in its watery habitat. It has a long and flattened tail, similar to its namesake, the caiman. The long tail helps the <b>caiman</b> <b>lizard</b> to successfully swim and dive. A clear third eyelid is thought {{to act like a}} pair of goggles underwater.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>caiman</b> <b>lizard</b> {{has been}} hard to keep in captivity. Due to their natural diet {{consisting}} almost purely of snails, most wild caught adults will refuse to eat anything else. Some zoos and aquariums have had success in keeping and breeding them.|$|R
50|$|The {{body of the}} <b>caiman</b> <b>lizard</b> is {{very similar}} to that of a crocodile. It is {{typically}} a bright green with slight dark green banding. There are horned raised scales along the dorsal of the back. This help to provide some protection against predators.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} {{caiman lizard}} {{spends most of}} its time in or near water. At night, it hides in trees and bushes. <b>Caiman</b> <b>lizards</b> in the wild will take a variety of prey: snails, fish, crawfish, clams, invertebrate and other freshwater inhabitants all can make up a <b>caiman</b> <b>lizards</b> diet. However they do specialize in snails. It takes the snail in the jaws, raises its head up so that the prey will slide {{into the back of}} the mouth, then crushes it with its back teeth. It then spits out the pieces of shell. The lizard has been known to even kill and eat amazon river turtles by crushing the shell by the edges and eating the softer parts chunk after chunk. It has also been known to burrow like its cousin the tegu.|$|E

5000|$|Yellow anacondas {{are known}} to be able to can prey on {{relatively}} large game, such as brocket deer or peccaries. Observations and analysis of gut and waste contents from regularly flooded areas in the Pantanal region of southwestern Brazil indicate the species is a generalist feeder that employs both ambush predation and wide-foraging strategies. The snakes forage predominately in open, flooded habitats, in relatively shallow water; most predation instances occur from June to November, when flooded areas have noticeably dried out and wading birds are the most common prey. They have also been known to prey on fish, turtles, small <b>caimans,</b> <b>lizards,</b> birds' eggs, small mammals and fish carrion. The prey-to-predator weight ratio is often much higher than for other types of Boidae.|$|R
50|$|With the {{addition}} of a Yellow Anaconda, the zoo started gaining popularity and was able to acquire more animals to their collection, but there was a slight twist. Instead of purchasing new animals from breeders Discovery Reptiles decided to rescue and rehabilitate unwanted animals and sick animals. They were able to rescue Sulcata Tortoise Geochelone sulcata, Jungle Carpet Pythons Morelia spilota cheynei, Coastal Carpet Pythons Morelia spilota mcdowelli, a Borneo Blood Python Python curtus breitensteini, an Argentine Black and White Tegu Tupinambis merianae, Amazon Tree Boa Corallus hortulanus, Bull Snakes Pituophis catenifer sayi, Corn Snakes Pantherophis guttatus guttatus, Hog Nose Snake Heterodon nasicus, Hog Island Boa Boa constrictor imperator and many more. They also added other animals, including a female <b>Caiman</b> <b>Lizard</b> to go along with their two male, critically endangered Grand Cayman Blue Iguanas Cyclura lewisi, and two endangered Louisiana Pine Snakes Pituophis ruthveni.|$|R
50|$|That being said, some owners claim {{there is}} a reward to keeping them. <b>Caiman</b> <b>lizards</b> are {{intelligent}} {{as can be seen}} in the way they approach a snail that is clinging to the rocks. They can solve problems which many other lizards apparently fail to and can generally recognize their owners, given they have been kept for the right amount of time and are in good health.|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} five years, farmed baby <b>caiman</b> <b>lizards</b> from South America have {{made their way into}} the pet trade around the world. These {{hatchlings}} are more willing to accept other food sources. Even so, this is not a lizard which by any means is easy to keep or raise in captivity. They have strong jaws that are capable of delivering painful bites. Their aquatic lifestyle means they need a large pool or tank, but also need a place to dig and burrow and logs or other suitable material with dry surfaces to bask on. This can be quite hard to accommodate due to their need for high humidity and high basking surface temperatures. Proceeded by the fact that these lizards can grow to be fairly large, up to 4 feet in length, a large enclosure is mandatory to successfully keep them alive.|$|E

50|$|Discovery Reptiles is a {{traveling}} zoo in Naples, Florida. Its collection includes {{some of the}} most endangered reptiles on earth. Discovery Reptiles was founded in 2009, and started with just four animals. They had two Red Tailed Boa Constrictors Boa constrictor, an Asian Water MonitorVaranus salvator and an African Rock MonitorVaranus albigularis ionidesi. Over the course of 2010 Discovery Reptiles slowly added to their animal collection {{with the addition of a}} <b>Caiman</b> <b>Lizard</b> Dracaene guianensis and Rhinoceros Iguana Cyclura cornuta which is listed as Threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN. The main purpose of the zoo is to educate the public on conservation and the importance of biodiversity; in order to do that it wanted to add an animal that would capture the attention of audiences around Southwest Florida. Discovery wanted an animal not found in the Southwest Florida region or commonly found in zoos, so they added a young female Yellow Anaconda Eunectes notaeus.|$|R
2500|$|World of Reptiles {{has been}} an {{attraction}} at the zoo since it first opened. The building's first curator was Raymond Lee Ditmars, who had kept 45 snakes in his attic before being hired at the zoo. The exhibit is a long hall with various terrariums situated on both sides. The exhibit also features a nursery area, which exhibits newborn herptiles born at the zoo, {{as well as a}} window into the off-show breeding and caring facilities. In the building, the zoo breeds and exhibits a wide range of endangered species, including Cuban crocodile, false gharial, yellow-headed day gecko, Mary River turtle, Fly River turtle, golden coin turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Volcán Darwin giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra microphyes), Egyptian tortoise, pancake tortoise, Panamanian golden frog, and golden poison dart frog. The building also is home to the zoo's breeding population of Kihansi spray toads, which the zoo saved from extinction. Other species held include lace monitor, northern <b>caiman</b> <b>lizard,</b> Taylor's cantil, green anaconda, eyelash palm pitviper, giant snake-necked turtle, Chiapas giant musk turtle, and Solomon Island leaf frog. On March 25, 2011, a cobra escaped from its off-show enclosure, during which time the exhibit was closed to the public. Six days later, the animal was found elsewhere in the building. The zoo named the cobra [...] "MIA" [...] (Missing In Action) and placed it on-exhibit.|$|R
50|$|Operation Central was {{the largest}} probe ever of the {{unlawful}} commercial exploitation of highly endangered sea turtles - {{all of which are}} listed under Appendix I of CITES which bans international trade. Operation Central was planned and designed to infiltrate two widely active segments of the black market wildlife trade - sea turtle skin and skin products moving illegally from Mexico to the United States and sea turtle shell and shell products being smuggled to the United States from China. The investigation also documented the role of U.S. retailers in the unlawful commercial exploitation of other CITES-listed species (including <b>caimans</b> and <b>lizards)</b> in the exotic boot trade. The government of Mexico coordinated enforcement activities with the Fish and Wildlife Service that also resulted in arrests in Mexico.|$|R

It is typically a bright green with slight dark green banding. The Paraguayan <b>caiman</b> <b>lizards</b> (Dracaena paraguayensis) are typically much more drab, with gray bodies and heads. There are tough raised scutes along the dorsal portion of the back. These give the caiman lizard a crocodilian appearance, and help to provide some protection against predators. These lizards can become up to 4 feet long and weigh up to 10 lbs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Three {{separate}} epidemics {{occurred in}} <b>caiman</b> <b>lizards</b> (Dracaena guianensis) that were imported into the USA from Peru in late 1998 and early 1999. Histologic evaluation of tissues from necropsied lizards demonstrated a proliferative pneumonia. Electron microscopic examination of lung tissue revealed {{a virus that}} was consistent {{with members of the}} family Paramyxoviridae. Using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against an isolate of ophidian (snake) paramyxovirus, an immunoperoxidase staining technique demonstrated immunoreactivity with-in pulmonary epithelial cells of 1 lizard. Homogenates of lung, brain, liver, or kidney from affected lizards were placed in flasks containing monolayers of either terrapene heart cells or viper heart cells. Five to 10 days later, syncytial cells formed. When Vero cells were inoculated with supernatant of infected terrapene heart cells, similar syncytial cells developed. Electron microscopic evaluation of infected terrapene heart cells revealed intracyto-plasmic inclusions consisting of nucleocapsid strands. Using negative-staining electron microscopy, abundant filamentous nucleocapsid material with a herringbone structure typical of the Paramyxoviridae was observed in culture medium of infected viper heart cells. Seven months following the initial epizootic, blood samples were collected from surviving group 1 lizards, and a hemagglutination inhibition assay was performed to determine presence of specific antibody against the caiman lizard isolate. Of the 17 lizards sampled, 7 had titers of # 1 : 20 and 10 had titers of. 1 : 20 and # 1 : 80. This report is only the second of a paramyxovirus identified in a lizar...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{morphological}} {{peculiarities of}} turtles have, {{for a long}} time, impeded their accurate placement in the phylogeny of amniotes. Molecular data used to address this major evolutionary question have so far been limited {{to a handful of}} markers and/or taxa. These studies have supported conflicting topologies, positioning turtles as either the sister group to all other reptiles, to lepidosaurs (tuatara, lizards and snakes), to archosaurs (birds and crocodiles), or to crocodilians. Genome-scale data {{have been shown to be}} useful in resolving other debated phylogenies, but no such adequate dataset is yet available for amniotes. Results In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to obtain seven new transcriptomes from the blood, liver, or jaws of four turtles, a <b>caiman,</b> a <b>lizard,</b> and a lungfish. We used a phylogenomic dataset based on 248 nuclear genes (187, 026 nucleotide sites) for 16 vertebrate taxa to resolve the origins of turtles. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian concatenation analyses and species tree approaches performed under the most realistic models of the nucleotide and amino acid substitution processes unambiguously support turtles as a sister group to birds and crocodiles. The use of more simplistic models of nucleotide substitution for both concatenation and species tree reconstruction methods leads to the artefactual grouping of turtles and crocodiles, most likely because of substitution saturation at third codon positions. Relaxed molecular clock methods estimate the divergence between turtles and archosaurs around 255 million years ago. The most recent common ancestor of living turtles, corresponding to the split between Pleurodira and Cryptodira, is estimated to have occurred around 157 million years ago, in the Upper Jurassic period. This is a more recent estimate than previously reported, and questions the interpretation of controversial Lower Jurassic fossils as being part of the extant turtles radiation. Conclusions These results provide a phylogenetic framework and timescale with which to interpret the evolution of the peculiar morphological, developmental, and molecular features of turtles within the amniotes. </p...|$|R
