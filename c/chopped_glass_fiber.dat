40|$|The creep of polymer {{concrete}} (PC) systems based on unsaturated polyester/styrene and versamid-cured epoxy resins was investigated using PC systems with different resin and aggregate contents, {{as well as}} the unfilled resins respectively. In both polyester and epoxy PC systems data was obtained at different temperatures, stresses, and resin contents. Data reduction made it possible to describe the creep compliance (J) of PC systems as a product of separable functions of time (t), temperature (T), stress (σ) and resin volume fraction (v) : J(t,T,σ,v) = J r (exp (-ΔH T/RT) exp (Kσσ) exp (K vv) t) m. The activation energy of the creep compliance is independent of temperature (Arrhenius behavior), decreases with increasing stress, and increases with resin content, indicating that creep behavior of the aggregate-filled PC systems is governed by the polymer matrix. Use of this master curve enables prediction of the long-term creep compliance of different PC systems through a range of temperatures, stresses and resin contents from limited data on a single system over short time periods (ca. 10 hours). Introduction of <b>chopped</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> in the polyester PC systems (in addition to aggregate and filler) enhanced their short-term flexural strength {{as well as the}}ir creep resistance. It also extended the stable creep domain to stress-to-strength ratios of 0. 8. The creep data obtained with fiber-reinforced PC systems at different levels of the governing variables (temperature, stress, resin content) were also reduced to a master curve using the triple-superposition scheme. Treatment of the glass fibers with silane coupling agent and dispersion of the mineral montomorrilonite (MMT) into the resin produced further enhancement in both the short-term flexural strength as well as the long-term creep resistance of fiber-reinforced PC systems. Morphological studies of the fracture surface of the PC systems indicated either adhesive failure (disbonding of the aggregate or the fiber from the resin matrix) or cohesive failure (aggregate or fiber rupture). The mode of failure depends on the size of aggregate, type of binding polymer, treatment of glass fiber and use of special additives. (Abstract shortened with permission of author. ...|$|E

30|$|Figure  6 shows a graph {{of storage}} modulus versus {{temperature}} for SiC-filled chopped glass fiber-reinforced epoxy composite. Storage modulus values for <b>chopped</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> SiC filler-reinforced epoxy composites show a linear trend with slight {{decrease in the}} value of storage modulus with the change in temperature (room temperature to 70 °C). This shows glassy regime in region 1, i.e., from room temperature to 65 °C. Region 2 shows a sharp decline in the values of storage modulus with the increase in the values of temperature (65 °C to 90 °C), i.e., the material changes from glassy to rubbery transition regime in the temperature range of 65 °C to 90 °C; due to a sharp drop {{in the value of}} storage modulus, the material has lost its usefulness as a structural material. Due to amorphous structure in the polymer and the presence of unorganized intermolecular structure, the storage modulus value drops suddenly. Region 3 again is a straight line showing negligible decrease in the values of storage modulus with the increase in the value of temperature. Here, the values of storage modulus nearly tend to zero, which shows a rubbery regime indicating degradation of the moduli above 90 °C. In the glassy state, i.e., at low temperatures, stiffness is related to the small displacement of molecules, whereas in the rubbery state at high temperature, molecular chains have considerable flexibility; so that in the undeformed state, they can adopt conformations that lead to maximum entropy. The higher values in region 1 and sharp decrease in the values in region 2 are {{due to the fact that}} in region 1, the material is in glassy state in which the contribution of elastic modulus is more than the viscous modulus, whereas in region 2, the material is in glass transition stage in which a change from glass transition state into rubber elastic state takes place. In the glass transition region, i.e., from glassy to the rubbery transition regime region, the value of storage modulus falls during heating to a level of 1, 000 th to 10, 000 th of its original value (Jinmin et al.

To do this analysis, we used the method of unconventional design of experiments to model the behaviour of material and consequently make decisions to reduce this wear.

The weld geometries used included mainly T-joint samples, and also butt welds were done, and some further analyses were done on CWF and shear samples made previously. Three different Design of Experiments (DOE) matrices were used to create three sets of T-joint samples which were analyzed to understand the interactions among the process parameters. The usual analysis of variance was extended by multivariate analysis to better define the individual roles of each of the process parameters. Cross-sections of the various types of welds were examined. DOE matrices were also performed on butt welds where the samples were either 3 mm thick welded to 3 mm thick samples, or 6 mm thick to 6 mm thick welds.

Impact failure of cladding panels made of GRC may occur during production if some tool falls onto the panel, due to stone or other objects impacting at low velocities or caused by debris projected after a blast. Impact failure of a front panel of a building may have not only an important economic value but also human lives may be at risk if broken pieces of the panel fall from the building to the pavement. Therefore, knowing GRC impact strength is necessary to prevent economic costs and putting human lives at risk. One-stage light gas gun is an impact test machine capable of testing different materials subjected to impact loads. An experimental program was carried out, testing GRC samples of five different formulations, commonly used in building industry. Steel spheres were shot at different velocities on square GRC samples. The residual velocity of the projectiles was obtained both using a high speed camera with multiframe exposure and measuring the projectile’s penetration depth in molding clay blocks. Tests were performed on young and artificially aged GRC samples to compare GRC’s behavior when subjected to high strain rates. Numerical simulations using a hydrocode were made to analyze which parameters are most important during an impact event. GRC impact strength was obtained from test results.

The main objective of this research is to study the possibility of recycling fiber obtained from mineral wool of the C&DW as an alternative material to <b>chopped</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> that are currently used as reinforcing elements in the prefabricated plaster. To achieve this objective, series are made of plaster E- 35 additived with rock wool residue and glass wool residue at different rates of addition. These series are repeated by changing the additive by E fiberglass (length of 25 mm) to make a comparative analysis with respect to the series additived with mineral wool waste. All the series are subjected to the test to determine Shore C surface hardness and mechanical testing to determine the compressive and flexural strength. From the results it can be concluded that: with rock wool residue, increases Shore C hardness up to 15 % with respect to the <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> and 9 % with respect to the glass wool, with a percentage of addition 2 %. With rock wool residue, weight is decreased by 5 % with respect to the <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> and 4 % with respect to the glass wool waste, with an addition percentage of 4 %. For an addition rate of 4 %, results in the flexural strength test with fiberglass are 85 % higher than those obtained with glass wool residue. However, for a percentage of 1 % addition, the results obtained with glass wool residue are 35 % higher than those obtained with fiberglass. For an addition rate of 3 % results in the compressive strength test with fiberglass are 54 % lower than those obtained with rock wool waste and 70 % lower than those obtained with glass wool waste. Comparing the two mineral wools, it can be concluded that up to 3 % of the addition, the glass wool series results obtained are 10 % higher than those additived with rock wool. However, higher percentages of addition show that the results obtained with rock wool are 35 % higher than those obtained with glass wool. The general conclusion is that the series additived with mineral wool from C&DW show better results in tests than the ones used nowadays as plaster reinforcement...|$|R
5000|$|Older {{structures}} that have failed offer clues to better practices. In addition to eliminating air where it contacts steel, modern concrete additives may include acrylic liquid [...] "admixtures" [...] to slow moisture absorption and increase shock {{resistance to the}} hardened product or to alter curing rates. These technologies, borrowed from the commercial tile installation trade, have greatly aided in the restoration of these structures. <b>Chopped</b> <b>glass</b> or poly <b>fiber</b> {{can be added to}} reduce crack development in the outer skin. (Chopped fiber could inhibit good penetration of the grout to steel mesh constructions. This should be taken into consideration and mitigated, or limited to use on outer subsequent layers. Chopped fibers may also alter or limit some wet sculpting techniques.) ...|$|R
30|$|The impact {{resistance}} of concrete was typically improved using additives, specifically fibers, to the polymer matrix or by replacing aggregate with energy absorbent ones. Li and Xu (2009) improved the energy absorption capacity and deformation at failure of PC by adding basalt fibers. The dynamic {{modulus of elasticity}} and energy absorption were also improved using marble particles (Martínez-Barrera and Brostow 2010). Moreover, dispersed <b>chopped</b> <b>glass</b> and carbon <b>fibers</b> were used to produce fiber reinforced polymer concrete with enhanced strength, stiffness and energy absorption (Wang et al. 2013; Sett and Vipulanandan 2004). For instance, chopped carbon fibers were proved to improve the energy absorption of isophthalic polyester mortar by up to 360  % (Sett and Vipulanandan 2004). Other researchers showed that carbon fibers with as low as 0.2  % volume fraction were able to improve the strength and energy absorption of concrete (Xu et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{composites}} with variable strength/toughness properties can {{be manufactured}} using combinations of brittle or ductile mesh {{in addition to}} brittle and ductile matrix reinforcements. The bending and tensile properties of thin sheet fiber cement composites made from these mixtures were investigated. Composites consisted of a woven mesh of either polyvinyl chloride (PVC) coated E-glass or polypropylene (PP) fibers for the surface reinforcement. In addition, chopped polypropylene, acrylic, nylon, and alkali-resistant (AR) <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> {{were used for the}} core reinforcement. It is shown that by controlling fiber contents, types, and combinations, design objectives such as strength, stiffness and toughness, can be achieved. Superior post-cracking behavior was measured for composites reinforced both with glass mesh and PP mesh. Load carrying capacity of PP mesh composites can be increased with the use of 1 % or higher <b>chopped</b> PP <b>fibers.</b> <b>Glass</b> mesh composites with short AR <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> as matrix reinforcement indicate an increased matrix cracking strength and modulus of rupture. Combinations of PP mesh/short AR glass did not show a substantial improvement in the matrix ultimate strength. An increased nylon fiber surface area resulted in improved post peak response...|$|R
