40|$|This paper {{presents}} an elastic shear stress distribution theoretical model at the carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) -adhesive interface of a single-rod and a multi-rod straight-pipe bonding anchor. A comparison between theoretical and {{finite element analysis}} results reveals that {{the accuracy of the}} theory can be used to guide the preliminary design of CFRP rod bonding anchors. The mechanical performance of the inner <b>cone</b> bonding <b>anchor</b> for multi-rods are evaluated within different coefficients of friction and inner inclined angles. Numerical results indicate that the straight-parabolic inner <b>cone</b> bonding <b>anchor</b> has a significant effect on reducing the shear force at the loading end...|$|R
50|$|<b>Anchor</b> <b>Cone</b> is a {{mountain}} in western British Columbia, Canada, {{located on the}} south side of Lowe Inlet, Grenville Channel, and southwest of Kitimat. It lies in the Countess of Dufferin Range, a subrange of the Kitimat Ranges which in turn form part of the Coast Mountains.|$|R
40|$|A {{retrospective}} histological and immunohistochemical {{study has}} been carried out in 25 cases of tick bites recorded in our Departments. The samples that included an attached tick showed a cement <b>cone</b> <b>anchoring</b> the mouthparts to the skin and a blood-soaked, spongiform appearance of the superficial dermis, with a mild neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltration. The vessels displayed a loose multilayered endothelial proliferation, with plump endothelia, permeated with erythrocytes. A few of them were severed, allowing copious blood extravasation. The established lesions included the following: erythema chronicum migrans-like cases, foreign body granulomas-sometimes containing remnants of the mouthparts-cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia, either of the T-cell or the B-cell type, and tick-bite alopecia. In both the T-cell and B-cell pseudolymphomas, several vessels showed concentric endothelial and perithelial proliferation similar to that seen in the acute lesions. In the tick-bite alopecia, a lymphocytic infiltrate attacked the permanent portion of the hair follicles, whose reaction was a noticeable hyperplasia of the fibrous sheaths, although only a minority of the hairs was destroyed. The observed alterations are specific in the acute lesions and in the alopecia, where they directly arise {{as a result of the}} interactions between the host's tissues and the antihemostatic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory chemicals contained in the tick saliva. In the other lesions, the changes seem less characteristic, although the fragments of mouthparts and the special vascular changes provide a clue to their etiology...|$|R
5000|$|Mr Garvey {{arrives at}} the planet Down, having heard about the natives called Grogs. Garvey Limited, a company owned by his father, makes {{artificial}} limbs and other tools for the [...] "Handicapped" [...] species; sentient beings that evolved minds but with nothing that would serve as hands, like dolphins. A local reluctantly agrees to show him a living Grog in the desert, but the Grog {{turns out to be}} a disappointment. It is sessile enough, being a furry <b>cone</b> living <b>anchored</b> to a rock, but it seems utterly void of sentience. The latter observation is later confirmed by a local exobiologist.|$|R

25|$|There {{are also}} many cytoskeletal-associated proteins, which perform {{a variety of}} duties within the growth <b>cone,</b> such as <b>anchoring</b> actin and microtubules to each other, to the membrane, and to other cytoskeletal {{components}}. Some of these components include molecular motors that generate force within the growth cone and membrane-bound vesicles which are transported {{in and out of}} the growth cone via microtubules. Some examples of cytoskeletal-associated proteins are Fascin and Filamin (actin bundling), Talin (actin anchoring), myosin (vesicle transport), and mDia (microtubule-actin linking).|$|R
40|$|Viral {{assembly}} was {{studied by}} viewing platinum replicas of cytoplasmic and outer plasma membrane surfaces of baby hamster kidney cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus. Replicas of the cytoplasmic {{surface of the}} basilar plasma membrane revealed nucleocapsids forming bullet-shaped tight helical coils. The apex of each viral nose <b>cone</b> was <b>anchored</b> to the membrane and was free of uncoiled nucleocapsid, whereas tortuous nucleocapsid {{was attached to the}} base of tightly coiled structures. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we identified the nucleocapsid (N) viral protein as a component of both the tight-coil and tortuous nucleocapsids, whereas the matrix (M) protein was found only on tortuous nucleocapsids. The M protein was not found on the membrane. Using immunoreagents specific for the viral glycoprotein (G protein), we found that the amount of G protein per virion varied. The G protein was consistently localized at the apex of viral buds, whereas the density of G protein on the shaft was equivalent to that in the surrounding membrane. These observations suggest that G-protein interaction with the nucleocapsid via its cytoplasmic domain may be necessary for the initiation of viral assembly. Once contact is established, nucleocapsid coiling proceeds with nose cone formation followed by formation of the helical cylinder. M protein may function to induce a nucleocapsid conformation favorable for coiling or may cross-link adjacent turns in the tight coil or both...|$|R
40|$|Approximating {{detailed}} {{models with}} coarse, texture-mapped meshes results in polygonal silhouettes. To eliminate this artifact, we introduce silhouette clipping, {{a framework for}} efficiently clipping the rendering of coarse geometry to the exact silhouette of the original model. The coarse mesh is obtained using progressive hulls, a novel representation with the nesting property required for proper clipping. We describe an improved technique for constructing texture and normal maps over this coarse mesh. Given a perspective view, silhouettes are efficiently extracted from the original mesh using a precomputed search tree. Within the tree, hierarchical culling is achieved using pairs of <b>anchored</b> <b>cones.</b> The extracted silhouette edges are used to set the hardware stencil buffer and alpha buffer, which in turn clip and antialias the rendered coarse geometry. Results demonstrate that silhouette clipping can produce renderings of similar quality to high-resolution meshes in less rendering time...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this paper is to characterize the mechanical behavior of a new embedded point-fixing device for laminated glass. This kind of support is based on the principle known as “interlayer junction” in which the anchor is bonded to the interlayer and embedded in the glass panes during the lamination process. The purposes of this innovative point-fixing system are mainly focused on interior architecture applications: e. g. balustrades, stairs, doors, elevators, design furniture, etc., taking advantage of the beautiful aesthetic of an “all-glass” element. This {{is due to the fact}} that, contrary to traditional point-fixings bolted connections, the countersunk hole is not passing through the outer glass layer, so that the truncated <b>cone</b> stainless steel <b>anchor</b> looks like embedded in the glass mass. A comprehensive experimental investigation on the load-bearing capacity under the combined action of axial and shear force has thus been performed. Finally, design criteria are provided and applied to a case study with demonstration purpose only. In addition to the interaction diagrams given for combined load cases between axial and shear force also a simplified analytical failure criterion, which is intended for use in the practical design, is proposed...|$|R
