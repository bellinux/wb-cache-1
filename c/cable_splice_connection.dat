40|$|Abstract. The main {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} was to investigate the cyclic performance of <b>splice</b> <b>connection</b> in weak-axis column-tree connections with the formation of plastic hinge assumed at <b>splice</b> <b>connection</b> and provide some design recommendations. By reducing the cross-sectional area of the splice plates, the <b>splice</b> <b>connection</b> in this test are designed as a weaken component to utilize the ductility capacity and energy dissipation. The results showed that it could develop the plastic rotation capacity in the beam <b>splice</b> <b>connection</b> and portion in the link beam but not increase the energy dissipation capacity during the same story drift ratio...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve larger spans of timber arch bridges, glulam massive timber {{sections}} must be spliced on-site by moment resisting and rotationally stiff joints. In this paper, a novel timber <b>splice</b> <b>connection</b> utilizing long threaded rods and grout-filled couplers is presented. Flexural characteristics of the splice joint were investigated by full-scale experimental tests and 3 D finite element models. An analytical model is proposed for determining the moment capacity and the rotational stiffness of the <b>splice</b> <b>connection.</b> The experimentally measured efficiency of the <b>splice</b> <b>connection</b> with regard to moment capacity and rotational stiffness was 69 % and 66 %, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{failure of}} post-and-beam w-beam {{guardrails}} during impact is sometimes {{due to the}} rupture of the w-beam rail where two sections are spliced together with bolts. This paper summarizes {{a study of the}} mechanics of failure of the <b>splice</b> <b>connection.</b> The causes of rupture are identified and a design alternative is formulated that will reduce the likelihood of rupture of the <b>splice</b> <b>connection.</b> The tensile forces in the w-beam rail and the mode of deformation of the <b>splice</b> <b>connection</b> during impact were critical factors considered in the study. The results of full-scale crash tests, laboratory tests and finite element analysis indicate that relocating splices to mid-span locations would greatly reduce the chance of observing a rupture of the guardrail in full-scale crash tests as well as real-world collisions...|$|R
