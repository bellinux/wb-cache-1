They arrived safely, but Christie suffered a miscarriage at the journey's end. Chinua rejoined them soon afterwards in Ogidi. These cities were safe from military incursion because they were in the southeast, part of the region which would later secede.|$|E
5|$|Commercials {{instructed}} fans to mail in episodes' geographical destinations during sweeps week. Advertisements appeared through Time Warner's television channels, Sports Illustrated for Kids, DC Comics publications, radio stations, and Warner Brothers stores. The contest {{marked the}} first time that Cartoon Network U.S., TNT Europe, Cartoon Network Europe, Cartoon Network Asia, and Cartoon Network Latin America united for a single promotion. Turner encouraged local cable operators to submit their own spots, generating 34,000ads among 174cable systems for a total of $3.4million cross-channel media support. 50,000children with a median age of ten entered the competition, and 20,000answered correctly. Turner selected ten viewers from the United States and nine from Latin America and Asia as grand-prize winners. They and two-hundred others received Quest-themed adventure packs, including a backpack, flashlight and siren, travel journal, pen, T-shirt, and glow sticks. Cartoon Network aired the names of winning <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> special feature in which Jeremiah Surd issued personal threats.|$|E

5|$|Overall, Super Typhoon Bess was {{responsible}} for ¥591.6billion (US$2.32billion) in damage and 95fatalities. According to police reports, 26people were initially missing. A total of 119were hurt. Four {{people were killed in}} Osaka due to landslides, while two people were buried alive in Yokohama via mudslides. At the foot of Mt. Fuji, a series of mudslides buried 36vehicles, killed one person and injured five policemen. The landslides stranded approximately 2,000persons, including 1,500primary school <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> camping trip. In Mie, Bess was considered the worst storm to affect the city in 23years, where 17fatalities occurred and seven were initially listed missing. Elsewhere, in Nara, a couple was killed and a boy was hurt. Throughout western Japan, five people were rendered missing in heavy rains that caused at least five landslides and damaged 15automobiles. Along Tokyo Bay, high waves from Typhoon Bess left windows 11stories high coated with salt. Although Tokyo was on {{the eastern edge of the}} storm, large trees were uprooted nevertheless due to high winds. Five people were wounded in the city. Many cars and trucks were stranded due to mudslides; air traffic was also paralyzed.|$|E
5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> day-to-day basis than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside {{the home and the}} mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E

25|$|Overall, studies {{investigating}} whether cognitive function in already iron-deficient {{children can be}} improved with iron supplements have produced mixed results, possibly because deficiency in critical growth periods may cause irreversible damage. However, several studies with better design have shown substantial benefits. One way to prevent iron deficiency is to give specific supplementation to children, for example as tablets. However, this is costly, distribution mechanisms are often ineffective, and compliance is low. Fortification of staple foods (cereals, flour, sugar, salt) to deliver micronutrients to <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> large scale {{is probably the most}} sustainable and affordable option, even though commitment from governments and the food industry is needed. Developed nations fortify several foods with various micronutrients.|$|E
25|$|Spock {{advocated}} {{ideas about}} parenting that were, at the time, considered {{out of the}} mainstream. Over time, his books helped to bring about major change. Previously, experts had told parents that babies needed to learn to sleep on a regular schedule, and that picking them up and holding them whenever they cried would only teach them to cry more and not to {{sleep through the night}} (a notion that borrows from behaviorism). They were told to feed their <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> regular schedule, and that they should not pick them up, kiss them, or hug them, because that would not prepare them to be strong and independent individuals in a harsh world. In contrast Spock encouraged parents to see their children as individuals, and not to apply a one-size-fits all philosophy to them.|$|E
500|$|Babcock {{was born}} into a family of {{thirteen}} <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> farm in Frontenac County, Ontario. According to Babcock, the barn where he was born (which no longer exists) was located off Highway 38 in South Frontenac Township. His father died in 1906 after a tree-cutting accident, when Babcock was only six years old. As described in his account given to Maclean's, while his father was cutting down one tree, another dead tree fell on his shoulder. Although he was brought into the house on bobsleigh, he only survived another two hours. Babcock said that this was an [...] "awful blow" [...] to the family.|$|E

500|$|Streep {{appeared}} with Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Winona Ryder in The House of the Spirits (1993), set during the military dictatorship of Chile. The film {{was not well}} received by critics. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote: [...] "This is really quite an achievement. It brings together Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Winona Ryder, Antonio Banderas, and Vanessa Redgrave and insures that, without exception, they all give their worst performances ever". The following year, Streep featured in The River Wild, {{as the mother of}} <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> whitewater rafting trip who encounter two violent criminals (Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly) in the wilderness. Though critical reaction was generally mixed, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone found her to be [...] "strong, sassy and looser than she has ever been onscreen".|$|E
500|$|... "Baby Don't Cry" [...] {{was used}} as the theme song for the Japanese {{television}} drama series, Himitsu no Hanazono (2007). Alongside this, it was included in three Japanese commercials: the Avex Trax [...] "Myu-Umo" [...] music commercial, the Pokemero Joysound commercial, and for the Fuji TV television series, Secret Garden. An accompanying music video was shot in Japan by Masashi Muto. It opens with Amuro running on outdoor steps, and walking along a pavement bridge. As the chorus starts, intercut scenes of trees are shown, as she walks through the city. The second verse has her walking through a park, with yellow-ish leaves on the ground. She witnessed two small <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> park bench, holding the chain to a dog. The third chorus then has her walking through a city square, and ends with her standing on a beach front at sunset.
