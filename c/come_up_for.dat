25|$|Obama {{resigned}} from the Senate effective November 16, 2008. Initially, {{it was thought that}} his replacement would be named by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Since the term for the seat expired in January 2011, it would <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> its normal election in 2010 with no special election necessary. Blagojevich was expected to name Obama's immediate successor in the Senate by January 3, 2009. However, on December 9, 2008, the status of Obama's succession in the Senate was cast in doubt after Blagojevich was arrested on federal corruption charges, which included allegedly attempting to sell the appointment. Although placed in federal custody and released on $4,500 bail, as long as he remained governor Blagojevich continued to have sole authority to make the appointment. Several Democrats, including Sen. Dick Durbin, asked the Illinois General Assembly to schedule a special election instead. Blagojevich appointed Roland Burris to fill Obama's vacated seat.|$|E
