5000|$|In Brazil, {{the most}} popular chamberings were for the [...]320 and [...]380 <b>centrefire</b> <b>cartridges,</b> similar to the [...]32 S&W and [...]38 S&W in appearance, but conical. They were also {{chambered}} for the [...]22 Short, [...]22 Long, [...]22 Long Rifle, and the [...]32, 8mm, and 9mm Flobert cartridges, among others.|$|E
5000|$|The Beaumont-Adams {{revolver}} is a muzzle-loading, double-action, percussion revolver. Originally {{adopted by}} the British Army in [...]442 calibre (54-bore, 11.2mm) in 1856, many were later converted to use <b>centrefire</b> <b>cartridges.</b> It was replaced in British service in 1880 by the [...]476 calibre (actually 11.6mm) Enfield Mk I revolver.|$|E
50|$|Impact bullet traps {{typically}} use vertical or angled 500 Brinell hardness {{steel plate}} at least 0.375 in thick for <b>centrefire</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Plate thickness of 4-6mm may be adequate for rimfire ammunition. Sloping plates deflect bullets downward into sand, water {{or some other}} capture material; but the plate angle is often steep enough to largely disintegrate the bullet upon initial impact, and bullets are expected to disintegrate upon impacting vertical plates. Shooter protection for firing positions within 25 m of the impact plate may require an anti-splash curtain of Linatex or similar self-healing material hung {{in front of the}} plate to contain any fragments of “back splash” as well as dust. Rifle bullets may be partially melted by the energy of bullet impact. The spray of molten metal may solidify as dust, and lead bullets often leave a smear of lead upon impacting the steel plate. Smeared metal may be converted to additional dust by subsequent bullet impact.|$|E
50|$|It was a {{bolt-action rifle}} {{based on the}} Mauser action, {{originally}} chambered for the 8×50mmR rimmed <b>centrefire</b> <b>cartridge</b> (not {{to be confused with}} the dimensionally similar Austrian 8×50mmR Mannlicher or French 8×50mmR Lebel cartridges). It was later upgraded as the Type 66 rifle and chambered to fire the 8x52mmR cartridge with a spitzer bullet.|$|R
50|$|The M1870 Vetterli was the Italian service rifle from 1870-1887, {{when it was}} {{gradually}} replaced with the M1870/87 Italian Vetterli-Vitali variant. The M1870 was a single-shot bolt action rifle chambered for the 10.4mm Vetterli <b>centrefire</b> <b>cartridge,</b> at first loaded with black powder and later with smokeless powder. The M1870 was based upon the M1869 Swiss Vetterli but simplified for economy.|$|R
5000|$|After the American Civil War, {{production}} continued of the Tranter percussion revolver (despite {{the increasingly}} availability of cartridge-firing designs) {{because many people}} thought percussion firearms were safer and cheaper than the [...] "new-fangled" [...] cartridge-based designs of the time. In 1863, Tranter secured the patent for rimfire cartridges in England, and started production using the same frame as his existing models. As early as 1868, Tranter had also begun the manufacture of <b>centrefire</b> <b>cartridge</b> revolvers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of the double rifle has always followed the {{development of}} the double-barrelled shotgun, the two are generally very similar but the stresses of firing a solid projectile are far greater than shot. The first double-barrelled muskets were created in the 1830s when deer stalking became popular in Scotland. Previously single barrelled weapons had been used but, recognising the need for a rapid second shot to dispatch a wounded animal, double-barrelled muskets were built along the same format as double-barrelled shotguns already in common use. These first double-barrelled weapons were black powder, smoothbore muzzleloaders built with either flintlock or percussion cap ignition systems. Whilst true rifling dates from the mid 16th century, the invention of the express rifle by James Purdey [...] "the Younger" [...] in 1856 allowed for far greater muzzle velocities to be achieved through a rifled longarm, significantly improving the trajectory and as such greatly improving the range of these rifles. [...] These express rifles had two deep opposing grooves which were wide and deep enough to prevent the lead bullets from stripping the rifling if fired at high velocities, a significant problem previously. These muzzle loading rifles came in a large variety of calibres, the most common calibres for medium thin skinned plains and deer sized game were [...]400 in, [...]450 in, [...]500 in, [...]577 in and 12 bore (18.5 mm or [...]729 in). For larger thick skinned type game 10 bore (19.7 mm or [...]775 in), 8 bore (21.2 mm or [...]835 in) and 4 bore (26.7 mm or 1.05 in) were used, the last being a specialist elephant hunting calibre. Whilst most of these calibres could be purchased with rifling, the giant 4 bore and the less common 6 bore were rarely rifled, as the increased friction from the rifling caused excessive recoil. Various experimental breech loaders had been in existence since the 16th century, however developments such as the Ferguson rifle in the 1770s and early pinfire cartridges in the 1830s had little impact on sporting rifles due to their experimental nature, expense and the extraordinary strength and reliability of the percussion muzzleloader. [...] In 1858, Westley Richards patented the break open, top leaver breech loading action, whilst a useful development these early break open designs {{had a great deal of}} elasticity in the action and upon firing they sprung open slightly, a problem that gradually worsened with repeated firing and with more powerful cartridges. Many gunmakers tried various methods to rectify this problem, all to little avail until Westley Richards invented the [...] "Dolls head" [...] lock in 1862 which greatly improved rigidity, this was followed by James Purdey's under-locking mechanism in 1863 and W.W. Greener's [...] "Wedge fast" [...] system in 1873, finally the basic break open action known to this day had the strength required to meet the stresses of large-bore projectiles. By 1914, triple, quadruple and even quintuple locking designs could be found in various proprietary actions. In 1861 the centrefire rifle cartridge was invented, and quickly a large number of blackpowder <b>centrefire</b> <b>cartridges</b> were developed in the same calibres as their muzzle loading forebears, [...] including the [...]450/400 Black Powder Express, the extremely popular [...]450 Black Powder Express, the [...]500 Black Powder Express and the [...]577 Black Powder Express, all with various case lengths. The first brass 10 bore, 8 bore and 4 bore cartridges were not developed until 1870, their arrival spelling the end of the muzzle loading era. Until this time all double rifles had external hammers whose fall struck the mechanism which fired the cartridge, however attempts to remove them were well under way. The first [...] "hammerless" [...] action of significance was invented by Thomas Murcott in 1871, known as [...] "The Mousetrap", it was a complex design but it sold in significant numbers. In 1875, Westley Richards employees William Anson and John Deeley patented the [...] "Anson & Deeley" [...] hammerless boxlock action, and in 1878 the Birmingham gunmakers W&C Scott & Son invented the basic sidelock action which was so successful it was immediately adopted by Holland & Holland. By 1900 the boxlock and sidelock hammerless actions had largely superseded the hammer rifles and, with the addition of ejectors and assisted opening, the basic design of the double rifle has changed little to this day. Interestingly, it was Westley Richards who invented the first reliable safety catch for doubles, ejectors, the single selective trigger and the special extractors that enabled rimless cartridges to be used in double rifles, all features found in modern double rifles. In 1898, John Rigby & Company loaded the [...]450 Black Powder Express with smokeless cordite creating the [...]450 Nitro Express, the first Nitro Express cartridge, this was to have a profound impact on sporting cartridge development and the double rifle was to become synonymous with the Nitro Express cartridges. Now in its final form and chambering modern Nitro Express cartridges, the British double rifle entered its golden age at the turn of 20th century and it was to last for the next three decades, with the birth of the White hunter and professional hunting safari industry in East Africa.|$|E

5000|$|The [...]222 Rimmed is a <b>centrefire</b> rifle <b>cartridge,</b> {{originating}} in Australia in the 1960s as a cartridge for single shot rifles, particularly the Martini Cadet action. Performance {{is similar to}} the [...]222 Remington on which it is based however loads should be reduced as the walls of the brass cases are generally thicker.Extraction of cases that have been loaded to higher pressures can be difficult due to the inefficient extraction method utilised by the Martini Cadet.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 1873 {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} Winchester rifles of its day, with Winchester marketing it as [...] "The Gun that Won the West". Still an icon in the modern day, it was manufactured between 1873 and 1923. It was originally chambered for the [...]44-40 cartridge, which was the first <b>centrefire</b> <b>cartridge</b> and which became immensely popular. The 1873 was later produced in [...]38-40 and [...]32-20, all of which later became popular handgun cartridges of the day, allowing users to carry just one type of ammunition. The Model 1873 was produced in four variations: a 24-inch barrel rifle, a 20-inch barrel carbine, and a [...] "musket"—which was aimed at military contracts and only made up less than 5% of production.(Musket was a term that, at the time, denoted a full length military-style stock, not to be confused with a true smoothbore musket). The standard rifle-length version was most popular in the 19th century, although Winchester would make rifles to order in any configuration the customer wished, including longer barrels or baby carbines with barrels as short as 12 inches, octagonal-shaped barrels, colour case hardened receivers and fancy engraving.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{relatively}} high velocity {{for the time}} and [...] "shocking" [...] power led to an initial surge of popularity, and the [...] "Imp" [...] was attributed with almost magical killing powers even on large and dangerous soft-skinned game such as tigers. Reverend H. R. Caldwell used his [...]22 Hi-power on 400 pound tigers in China with success, something the Savage rifle company exploited in its advertising for the cartridge in the early days. The famous elephant hunter WDM Bell used a [...]22 Savage Hi-Power to kill Cape buffalo in West Africa in the 1920s, and reported in his magazine articles that the cartridge was popular at that time for red deer stalking in Scotland. While it {{was used in the}} UK on deer as large as Red Stags, it fell out of favour as a big game cartridge due to its small caliber and light bullets. Other [...]22 <b>Centrefires</b> <b>cartridges</b> outstripped it in performance such as the [...]220 Swift, and after the 1950s, {{with the advent of the}} [...]222 Remington, the cartridge was considered obsolete. Today it is regarded as a vintage round, and aficionados use it for small game hunting in similar applications as the [...]222 and the [...]223 Remington; although it is used for deer hunting where it is legal to do so. In Europe the cartridge is still chambered in combination guns, and the cartridge is still used by hunters for smaller European deer species such as Roe deer.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]240 Holland & Holland Magnum (also {{known as}} the [...]240 Apex, [...]240 Belted Nitro Express, [...]240 Magnum Rimless, or [...]240 Super Express) is a <b>centrefire</b> {{sporting}} rifle <b>cartridge</b> developed in England in the 1920s, primarily for use in hunting deer and plains game. This round has always been {{closely associated with the}} firm of Holland & Holland, rifle and gun makers of London, England, which has built more magazine and double rifles in this calibre than anyone else. A rimmed variant of this cartridge, {{known as the}} [...]240 Magnum Flanged, was developed for use in double rifles.|$|R
5000|$|The Mauser M 98 bolt {{system was}} {{introduced}} in the Mauser Gewehr 98 and is the most common bolt-action system in the world, being in use in nearly all modern hunting rifles and the majority of military bolt-action rifles until the middle of the 20th century. The Mauser system is stronger than that of the Lee-Enfield due to two locking lugs just behind the bolt head which make it better able to handle higher pressure cartridges (i.e. [...] "Magnum" [...] calibre <b>centrefire</b> rifle <b>cartridges).</b> The 8×68mm S and 9.3×64mm Brenneke magnum rifle cartridge [...] "families" [...] were designed for the Mauser M 98 bolt action. A novel safety feature was the introduction of a third locking lug present {{at the rear of the}} bolt that normally did not lock the bolt, since it would introduce asymmetrical locking forces. The Mauser system features [...] "cock on opening", meaning the upward rotation of the bolt when the rifle is opened cocks the action. A drawback of the Mauser M 98 system is that it cannot be cheaply mass-produced very easily. Many Mauser M 98 inspired derivatives feature technical alterations, such as omitting the third safety locking lug, to simplify production.|$|R
