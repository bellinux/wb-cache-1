40|$|ABSTRACT High {{toxicity}} of the preservatives {{most frequently used}} in wood treatment and the resulting risks of handling {{pose a threat to}} small producers and to the environment. In an attempt to mitigate these problems, the present study was conducted with the objective of evaluating the preservative effect of tannic extract on biodeterioration of Acacia mearnsii wood. For this purpose, untreated and preserved specimens, some with tannin extract and some with a preservative mixture based on CCB (Chromated <b>Copper</b> <b>Borate),</b> were submitted to accelerated rotting trials with the fungus that causes white rot (Pycnoporus sanguineus) for 16 weeks. The evaluations were made with a basis on weight loss and chemical components analysis, and they showed that the natural resistance of Acacia wood is moderate when exposed to the white rot fungus. The tannin concentrations showed similar effects to those of the CBB mixture in all evaluations, i. e., they significantly increased the biological resistance of the material, which started to be classified as very resistant to the fungus. Overall, the results suggest that tannin can be considered as a potential natural preservative product...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} {{aimed to}} evaluate the influence of removing the diaphragm {{on the quality of}} the preservative treatment of bamboo culms of Dendrocalamus giganteus and Bambusa vulgaris submitted to sap displacement method. The bamboos were collected in clumps in Alegre and Jerônimo Monteiro, south of Espírito Santo state, Brazil. The stems were sectioned in culms of 2. 0 m in length. One part of the culms had the diaphragm removed while in the other they were kept unbroken. The culms were treated in soutions of 1 % and 3 % of active ingredients (a. i.) of copper, chromated <b>copper</b> <b>borate</b> (CCB). The culms were kept in the solution for 5, 10 and 15 days. The preservative treatment quality was evaluated by means of penetration and retention of CCB in culms. There was greater penetration of copper and boron at the base of the culms, the removing of the diaphragm provided greater movement of the solution in the culms and the retention was, for most treatment conditions, below than the one recommended by Brazilian standards for wood preservative treatment...|$|E
40|$|Strontium <b>copper</b> <b>borate</b> SrCu 2 (BO 3) 2 {{is a novel}} {{material}} with a spin gapped ground state. Its crystal structure is topologically equivalent to the Shastry Sutherland lattice. We have studied the spin- 1 / 2 models on the Shastry Sutherland lattice in undoped case and doped cases, by using exact diagonalization method on the 32 -site lattice. In the undoped case, we study magnon (triplet) dispersions of the Heisenberg model with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. Fine features on the first branch of magnon dispersions in SrCu 2 (BO 3) 2 {{can be explained by}} using relatively small DM interactions. We also study the effects of these anisotropic couplings on the first branch of magnon dispersions and extract their magnitudes from the experimental data. They will be useful in describing fine features on other branches of magnon dispersions. In the doped case, we study the spin and the hole properties of the t-J model on the Shastry Sutherland lattice with up to two holes. We have found that two dominant spin orders, the diagonal dimer order and the anti-ferromagnetic long range order, are enhanced at different signs of t' /t. We also argue that the effects of geometrical frustration are influenced by the doping level. However, we have not found any hole pairing across a diagonal in the diagonal dimer region at the realistic t/J value. Therefore, this is an example where doping a spin gapped system does not guarantee hole pairing...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand {{for renewable energy}} is driving innovations in both science and technology. Hydrogen has been broadly identified as a potential clean energy carrier due to its high energy capacity (enthalpy of combustion {{is as high as}} 286 kJ/mol) and environmental friendliness (the only product after burning is water). Meanwhile, solar energy is renewable, abundant and easily available. Solar-driven H 2 production from water has therefore attracted global attention in the past decades since the first report of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting based on an n-type TiO 2 photoanode. Many semiconductor-based materials have been synthesized and studied for their photocatalytic or PEC performance. Among them, visible-light-active photocatalytsts are more promising since the energy of the visible-light region takes up {{a large proportion of the}} whole solar spectrum. Herein, we found two novel groups of compounds, e. g. <b>copper</b> <b>borates</b> and boron carbides. We investigated the origins and performances of their photocatalytic water splitting under visible light irradiation. It is found that the visible light activities of the two groups are resulted from different band-gap engineering mechanisms. For the two <b>copper</b> <b>borates</b> compounds, e. g. CuB 2 O 4 and Cu 3 B 2 O 6, we found that the visible light activity is from the intrinsic midgap states in the two compounds. Both midgap states serve as an electron acceptor level, but they function very differently in the two <b>copper</b> <b>borates.</b> For CuB 2 O 4, the midgap states facilitate the visible light absorption for photocatalytic water splitting, while for Cu 3 B 2 O 6, the midgap states trap electrons and reduce the photocatalytic activity. For the two boron carbides, e. g. B 4. 3 C and B 13 C 2, they exhibit efficient photocatalytic H 2 evolution and PEC H 2 evolution as a stable photocathode under visible light irradiation. Interestingly, it is found that the inherent defects and structural distortions in B 4. 3 C cause a continuum downshift of its conduction band (CB) edge that facilitates visible-light absorption and water splitting based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In B 13 C 2, however, the more complicated structural defects and distortions result in a large number of midgap states between the CB and the valence band (VB), which reduce its overall photocatalytic and PEC water splitting efficiency by promoting charge recombination...|$|R

In all of the structures, the boron cations form BO 3 triangles, which are connected {{with each other and}} with copper polyhedra only via corners in Li 6 CuB 4 O 10 and Li 3 CuB 3 O 7 and via both corners and edges in Li 8 Cu 7 B 14 O 32 and Li 2 Cu 9 B 12 O 28. The Li 3 CuB 3 O 7 and Li 8 Cu 7 B 14 O 32 compounds were synthesized as pure samples with only trace amounts of impurities; hence, their magnetic properties could be investigated and analyzed in terms of underlying magnetic couplings. Other compositions always represented multiphase mixtures. Li 3 CuB 3 O 7 features infinite Cu,O chains formed by Cu 2 O 6 units consisting of edge-shared CuO 4 squares. Together with two apical oxygen atoms with long interatomic Cu-O distances of 2. 7 - 2. 8 angstrom, the Cu 2 O 6 units form chains extended along the a-axis. These pseudochains are responsible for strong anisotropic thermal expansion behavior. The temperature dependence of the magnetization between 4 and 380 K for Li 3 CuB 3 O 7 could be fit well by a spin-dimer model. The magnetic susceptibility of Li 8 Cu 7 B 14 O 32 showed a more complex temperature dependence, with two different Curie-Weiss regimes in the temperature range of 2 - 380 K...|$|R

In this paper, {{we report on the}} infrared and Raman spectroscopic studies of the lattice dynamics and the electronic structure of 3 d^ 9 copper states below the fundamental absorption band. The lattice dynamics is characterized by a large number of phonons due to a low P 1 space group symmetry and a large unit cell with Z= 10. Unusually rich set of phonons was found in the low-energy part of the infrared and Raman spectra below 100 cm^- 1, which we tentatively assign to interlayer vibrations activated by a crystal superstructure and/or to weak force constants for modes related to some structural groups. Several phonons show anomalous behavior {{in the vicinity of the}} magnetic phase transition at T_N= 10 K thus evidencing magnetoelastic interaction. No new phonons were found below T_N, which excludes the spin-Peierls type of the magnetic transition. In the region of electronic transitions, a strong broad absorption band centered at ∼ 1. 8 eV is observed, which we assign to overlapping of transitions between the 3 d^ 9 states of Cu^ 2 + ions split by the crystal field in nonequivalent positions. The fundamental charge-transfer absorption band edge has a complex structure and is positioned around ∼ 2. 8 - 3. 0 eV. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, 68 reference...|$|E
40|$|Alkyl Ammonium Compound (AAC) and Protein Ammonia <b>Copper</b> <b>Borate</b> (PACB) are {{two types}} of {{waterborne}} preservatives. In this paper they were examined, first by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under different heating rates (5 or 40 ℃/min), second by using thermogravimetric analysis with infrared spectrometry (TGA-IR), and third by using continuous emission monitoring (CEM) techniques. The results obtained from the TGA tests found that the decomposition temperature of AAC and PACB at the heating rate of 5 ℃/min was lower than that at 40 ℃/min. Regardless of the different heating rates, the decomposition temperatures of PACB were all higher than those for AAC, and the char (wt %) of the PACB (65. 38 wt % for 5 ℃/min and 66. 92 wt % for 40 ℃/min) was more than that of the AAC (0. 042 wt % for 5 ℃/min and 0. 046 wt % for 40 ℃/min). The IR response of AAC and PACB in the TGA-IR tests showed that at a heating rate of 5 ℃/min, the evolved species of AAC were less than those of PACB. However, at a heating rate of 40 ℃/min the numbers of evolved species of AAC were much higher than those of PACB. Considering the decomposition step (thermal time or temperature) at different heating rates in the TGA tests and the IR response from the TGA-IR analysis, the results showed that at the slow-heating regime, the concentrations of CO_ 2 and the evolved species of =CH_ 2 groups produced by PACB were higher than those of AAC, but at 40 ℃/min the results were reversed. The results of combustion emissions obtained by CEM techniques found that the emission gas temperature of AAC was higher than that of PACB. Both O_ 2 and CO_ 2 reached a plateau curve until the end of combustion, during which time they were closely related. The highest emission quantity of CO was about 94. 0 ppm for AAC, but it was 120. 0 ppm for PACB. The emission quantity of SO_ 2 for each type of sample was zero. The maximum NOx for AAC was about 49. 5 ppm, but it was insignificant for the amount of PACB during combustion. The above results of the TGA-IR and CEM analysis allowed us to determine the kinds of evolved species and the emission gas concentrations of O_ 2 and CO_ 2, the emission contents (CO, SO_ 2, NOx), and the temperature of the emission gases for referencing the thermo-decomposition processes of AAC and PACB during combustion...|$|E

Several of the formulations-three quaternary ammonium compounds, copper naphthenate, and Folpet imparted some decay resistance to the blocks but were not detectable with the bioassay.

Moreover, the mechanism of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on copper in mildly alkaline media has been studied by means of EIS over the frequency range of 0. 01 Hz ≤ f ≤ 5 kHz. The impedance spectra were modeled using a mechanism based upon the Volmer-Heyrovsky-Tafel steps for hydrogen evolution and by considering the reactions involved in hydrogen atom and hydroxyl group adsorption on the copper surface. A single set of kinetic parameters, including the rate constants and transfer coefficient, has been derived for each pH by optimization of the mechanistic model on the experimental impedance (eis) data.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to show a comprehensive literature review about wood preservation in Brazil, since the earliest years until 2011. Brazil is rich in natural resources and wood has always occurred in abundance. With the industrial growing, there was the necessity of using wood with low natural durability but with chemical preservative treatment. Wood chemical treatment began in late XIX century, mainly to attend the big demand of sleepers to railroads. Only during the 60 ’s, wood preservation gained market with the increase of scientific researches, elaboration of technical standards and building industrial plants for wood preservation. From this point on, few advances have been reached. In 2011, Eucalyptus and Pinus, were the main species used in wood preservation plants that adopts the vacuum-pressure process. In small production scale, diffusion process is adopted. Copper chromium arsenate (CCA) and <b>Copper</b> chromium <b>borate</b> (CCB) are the most preservatives utilised with some creosote utilisation. The treatedwood production is concentrated in fence posts, poles and sleepers. As a trend, the wood preservation must reach new markets, such as building constructions, wood packages and crossarms, and also to intensify the traditional uses. Although {{there are a lot of}} researches about chemicals for wood preservation, CCA must keep by the years, once alternative products do not present the same efficacy or clear effects about human health and environment...|$|R

The energy band gap measurements of the glass samples reveal that, introducing <b>copper</b> into lithium <b>borate</b> glass reduce the energy band gap of the samples, while the addition of SnO 2 into Cu-doped sample increase the energy band gap. The impact of SnO 2 gives an enhancement in the luminescence intensity by almost 3 times when 0. 1 mol% SnO 2 was added to 0. 1 mol% Cu-doped borate glass. The peaks shapes shifted from blue luminescence to blue and green luminescence for Cu-doped and co-doped samples respectively. The thermoluminescence (TL) properties of Cudoped and co-doped with SnO 2 glass were investigated in this work. The glow curves position of Cu-doped and co-doped with SnO 2 glass were recorded at 205 ?C and 215 ?C respectively at a heating rate of 20 ?Cs? 1. In addition, the optimum annealing procedure of Cu-doped and co-doped with SnO 2 glass was 20 min at 400 ?C and 30 min at 400 ?C respectively. The highest TL intensity of Cu-doped sample was recorded at Cu concentration of 0. 1 mol%. The highest TL intensity for co-doped with SnO 2 glass was observed at SnO 2 concentration of 0. 1 mol%. The linear relationship of dose?TL intensity was observed for both glass samples for different doses ranging from 0. 5 to 4. 0 Gy subjected to 6, 10 and 12 MV X-ray photon energies and Co? 60 gamma ray. The co-doped with SnO 2 glass has always higher TL response compared to Cu-doped glass. The study of fading characteristics shows that co-doped with SnO 2 glass has lower fading compared to Cu-doped glass. Reproducibility study of both types of glasses show the thermoluminescence intensity of Cu-doped glass are slowly decreasing about 1. 6 % with the repeating readout and about 1. 3 % for co-doped with SnO 2. Study on the TLD sensitivity shows that the co-doped with SnO 2 glass is almost 6 times more sensitive than the Cudoped glass. The TL sensitivity was found as 75 ?C g? 1 Gy? 1 and 266 ?Cg? 1 Gy? 1 for Cu-doped and co-doped with SnO 2 glass respectively. The relative energy response of Cu-doped and co-doped with SnO 2 glass have been calculated theoretically for photon energies up to 1. 25 MeV and it is found that the theoretical calculations are in good agreement with the experimental results.
