40|$|The UK is a {{world leader}} {{in the use of}} <b>carbon</b> <b>footprints.</b> The {{introduction}} of PAS 2050 has legitimised <b>carbon</b> <b>footprinting</b> and manufacturers and retailers have responded by estimating <b>carbon</b> <b>footprints</b> for selected products. In industrial production, where the relationship between inputs and outputs is constant and the process is tightly controlled, <b>carbon</b> <b>footprints</b> tend to be reproducible. However, agricultural production is different, being influenced by biological, geological and climatic variation. Thus, although the use of a single value to represent the carbon burden of a food product is appealing, in practice it can be misleading. This paper discusses the variability associated with <b>carbon</b> <b>footprints</b> of agricultural products and considers the value of carbon labelling. We suggest that <b>carbon</b> <b>footprinting</b> is a useful approach that will assist in the transition to a low carbon society but that current approaches to carbon labelling may not help consumers understand the carbon burden of agricultural products...|$|R

5|$|A {{study by}} Arima et al. {{published}} in May 2011 used spatial regression modeling {{to provide the}} first statistical assessment of ILUC for the Brazilian Amazon due to soy production. Previously, the indirect impacts of soy crops were only anecdotal or analyzed through demand models at a global scale, while the study took a regional approach. The analysis showed a strong signal linking the expansion of soybean fields in settled agricultural areas at the southern and eastern rims of the Amazon basin to pasture encroachments for cattle production on the forest frontier. The results demonstrate the need to include ILUC in measuring the <b>carbon</b> <b>footprint</b> of soy crops, whether produced for biofuels or other end-uses.|$|E
5|$|LCA is {{used for}} example in the {{building}} sector. Buildings today account for the 40% of the world’s energy use. The resulting carbon emissions are substantially {{higher than those of}} the transportation sector. New buildings using more energy than necessary are being built every day, and millions of today's inefficient buildings will remain standing until at least 2050. It’s therefore necessary to start reducing energy use in new and existing buildings {{in order to reduce the}} planet's energy-related <b>carbon</b> <b>footprint.</b> Growing interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building. Mineral, vegetable, or animal materials such as perlite, vermiculite, rock wool, glass wool, cork, plant fibers (cotton, flax, hemp, coconut), wood fiber, cellulose, and sheep's wool can be used for the production of insulation panels.|$|E
40|$|Many {{countries}} are now developing {{policies and measures}} to promote zero or low carbon buildings. However, as a clear definition of zero carbon building (ZCB) and effective evaluation methods for buildings’ <b>carbon</b> <b>footprints</b> are not available, people are often confused about the performance of ZCBs. This research investigates the meaning of ZCBs and develops methods for evaluating their <b>carbon</b> <b>footprints.</b> The definition of ZCB and its related concepts are described. The meaning of footprints and the rationale for using <b>carbon</b> <b>footprints</b> as indicators to measure sustainability are presented. It is found that footprint-based assessment requires {{a clear understanding of}} emissions categories, assessment boundaries and carbon accounting principles. The assessment outcome depends on the problem definition and interpretation methodology. The main influences on <b>carbon</b> <b>footprints</b> include building functions, site conditions, energy and carbon intensity of the building systems and components. In order to develop systematic methods for assessing ZCBs, a holistic approach to <b>carbon</b> accounting and <b>footprint</b> calculation is needed. When applying the concepts to assess the buildings in high density cities like Hong Kong, some key factors for urban density and community sustainability should be considered, such as transportation strategy, urban form and typology...|$|R

40|$|There {{is little}} {{research}} evidence of <b>carbon</b> <b>footprints</b> becoming a decisive factor when making product purchase decisions. Consumer attitudes towards disposal methods of returned items {{as a predictor}} of their intention to continue patronising the products was used as a proxy to assess the influence of <b>carbon</b> <b>footprints</b> in consumer purchase preferences. There is evidence in this study that consumers accept the reconstitution of returned appliances and clothing items, but they themselves are not prepared to repurchase from mainline stores those brands that are known to be selling as reconstituted items in alternative stores or charity shops. Notwithstanding manufacturers' attempts to build brand equity with smaller <b>carbon</b> <b>footprints</b> by responsible disposal of returned items, it may be prudent for producers not to publicise the availability of their reconstituted brands in alternative/charity stores, because prime consumers might be inhibited from patronising the pristine brands in mainstream stores. Reconciling the double-mindedness of consumer attitudes towards smaller <b>carbon</b> <b>footprints</b> may foreshadow major changes to the way products are positioned in future...|$|R

According to a representative of Standard Chartered, which invested US$75 million in Saudi Binladin Group, Saudi Arabia is going to spend over US$400 billion (SR1.5 trillion) on infrastructure {{over the next few}} years. According to reports by Citi Investment Research & Analysis, $220 billion worth of development, accounting for 36% of all construction spending in the MENA region, will be directly or indirectly beneficial to Jeddah Tower. Jeddah Tower and City themselves are intended to set an example of green development, using modern technology and having a low <b>carbon</b> <b>footprint</b> relative to the number of people they will support. However, there is also an increasing problem of poor education levels in Arab countries {{due to a lack of}} spending in research and education, which it is argued should be invested in rather than building skyscrapers, and that the tower is nothing more than a symbol of hubris.
