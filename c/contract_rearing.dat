40|$|Mountain farming {{areas are}} {{associated}} with high nature value and offer attractive landscapes, but farming in these areas is less viable than farming in more favorable regions. Consequently, there is a threat of land abandonment. Additionally, due to lower productivity of mountain farms, their products often bear a higher environmental burden than those from other areas. An optimal division of labor between mountain farms and farms in more favorable regions based on comparative advantages could help maintain attractive landscapes and reduce environmental impacts of agricultural production. An established Swiss <b>contract</b> <b>rearing</b> system, in which dairy farms from the agriculturally favorable lowlands collaborate with heifer rearing farms in the mountains, represents a promising approach for such a division of labor. In this system, the intensive phase of dairy production is performed in the lowlands, while the less intensive phase is performed in the mountains. Here, we analyzed a sample of 16 farms to compare the <b>contract</b> <b>rearing</b> system to {{a situation in which}} both, mountain and lowland farms produce milk and rear their own restocking animals. We performed a life cycle assessment to quantify environmental impacts of the dairy production systems, assessing environmental impacts both per kg of milk and per hectare of agricultural area. This assessment was supplemented with analysis of the workload of the farms, since increased work efficiency is one reason that farmers engage in <b>contract</b> <b>rearing.</b> Workload was calculated with a workload budgeting tool. We found that collaboration reduced environmental impacts as well as the workload per kg of milk. Collaboration had no effect on environmental impacts per hectare of agricultural area or the workload on lowland farms, while on mountain farms the environmental impacts and workload were reduced. In particular, reduction in environmental impacts of mountain farms is expected to foster the high nature value of this farmland and the provisioning of important ecosystem services. This case study of a <b>contract</b> <b>rearing</b> system thus illustrates how collaboration based on comparative advantages can benefit both environmental impacts of agricultural products and the high nature value of agriculturally less favorable farmland...|$|E
40|$|Joint farming ventures (JFVs) are {{promoted}} within Irish and EU policy discourses as {{strategies that}} {{can enhance the}} economic and social sustainability of family farming. Research has shown that JFVs, including arrangements such as farm partnerships, <b>contract</b> <b>rearing</b> and share farming, can potentially enable farmers to work cooperatively to improve farm productivity, reduce working hours, facilitate succession, develop skills and improve relationships within the farm household. In the context of increasing policy promotion of JFVs, {{there is a need to}} make some attempt at understanding the macro socio-cultural disposition of family farming to cooperation. Reviewing sociological studies of agricultural cooperation and taking a specific focus on the Irish contextual backdrop, this paper draws the reader’s attention to the importance of historical legacy, pragmatic economic and social concerns, communicative norms, inter-personal relationships, individualism and, policy and extension stimuli, all of which shape farmers’ dispositions to cooperation and to JFVs specifically. peer-reviewedThis work was funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Ireland under the Research Stimulus Fund (RSF), Project Number: 11 /S/ 151...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Severe {{outbreaks}} of interdigital phlegmon (IP) {{associated with a}} high morbidity and major economic losses have occurred in Finland in the past decade. A survey was performed to indicate the current occurrence of infectious hoof diseases and to identify herd level risk factors predisposing to an outbreak of IP. Results Responses to a questionnaire revealed that an outbreak of IP defined as morbidity ≥ 5 % within the 1 st month of the outbreak, had occurred in 18. 0 % of the respondent study farms. Risk factors for an outbreak included animal transport between herds, i. e. either animal purchase or <b>contract</b> heifer <b>rearing,</b> enlargement or renovation of the barn, and if the fields of the farm had been organically cultivated. Having any kind of mechanical ventilation in comparison to natural ventilation seemed to {{lower the risk of}} IP. Additionally, the farms that had experienced an outbreak of IP often had other infectious hoof diseases. However, it was unclear which disease appeared first. Conclusions More attention is needed before and during enlargement or renovation of the barn and substantial planning is crucial for every part of the enlargement process in dairy farms...|$|R
40|$|A {{dynamic and}} {{stochastic}} simulation model (the "JohneSSim model") {{was developed to}} evaluate the economic and epidemiological effects of different strategies for control of paratuberculosis in dairy herds. Animals occupy {{one of the six}} defined infection states; the spread of Johne's disease is modeled with five infection routes. Many different dairy farm situations can be simulated. Control strategies that can be simulated are: (1) test-and-cull; (2) calf hygiene management; (3) vaccination and (4) grouping of animals. Losses are caused by: (1) reduced milk production; (2) diagnosis and treatment costs; (3) lower slaughter value of cows and (4) sub-optimal culling. The benefits were calculated as reduction in the losses caused by Johne's disease; the costs of each strategy were calculated on the basis of actual costs of each item; and net present value (NPV) was calculated as benefits minus costs. Herd and prevalence data from The Netherlands and Pennsylvania, USA were used. In both situations, a low true mean prevalence within 20 years could be reached only when all calf management tools were applied. The Dutch control program (PPN) was on average economically attractive (with or without labor costs, the average NPV was Euro 1183 and 12, 397, respectively). In Pennsylvania, <b>contract</b> heifer <b>rearing</b> and improved calf hygiene reduced the prevalence effectively and had large economic benefits (US$ 43, 917 for 20 -year period) if the calves were sent to the heifer facility while very young. Validation with data from 21 infected Dutch dairy farms (as well as face-validation: comparison {{of the results of the}} JohneSSim model with experiences of Johne's experts) supported the basic assumptions in the model...|$|R
40|$|Our {{previous}} work {{has shown that}} male Sprague–Dawley rats reared in social isolation, standard housing and environmental enrichment differ in their spontaneous open-field activity and in some neurobehavioral depressive-like parameters. Here, we extended this evidence by using a shorter postweaning rearing period (1 month) and including additional evaluations. First, {{in order to obtain}} a better characterization of the exploratory strategies among rearing conditions we analyzed in detail the spontaneous activity at the first minute and during the 10 -min session. Second, we asked whether the changes in open-field activity were related with basal anxiety levels in the elevated plus-maze. Third, behavior in the forced-swimming test was analyzed and afterward, the tissue levels of hippocampal norepinephrine and serotonin were assessed. The possible relationship between neurotransmitters and forced-swimming behavior were explored through correlation analyses. We found that rearing conditions (i) differed on locomotor habituation and on sensory-motor exploration at the first minute and during the 10 -min session without modifying the plus-maze behavior; (ii) affected differentially the grooming time, its sequential components, and the relationship between grooming and locomotor parameters; (iii) modified forced-swimming behavior and the hippocampal concentration of norepinephrine, serotonin, and its turnover; and (iv) produced different correlation patterns between both neurotransmitters and forced-swimming behaviors. Overall, environmental enrichment accelerated open-field habituation and led to behavioral and neurochemical antidepressant-like effects. In <b>contract,</b> isolation <b>rearing</b> strongly impaired habituation and simple information processing, but showed marginal effects on depressive-like behavior and on hippocampal neurochemistry. The current results suggest that differential rearing is not only a useful procedure to study behavioral plasticity or rigidity in response to early experience, but also to modeling some developmental protective or risk factors underlying depressive disorders.

40|$|Wommack, K. EricThe {{production}} of chicken for their meat (broilers) is a multi-billion dollar industry in which large firms <b>contract</b> the chicken <b>rearing</b> out to individual local farms. Poultry litter, composed of bedding material, chicken excrement and feathers, and spilled feed is often maintained {{on the floor}} of the house through many successive growing cycles. The litter generated by this process is used extensively as both feed for other domestic animals and as crop fertilizer. Highthroughput sequencing was chosen as a means to assess the richness and diversity of the poultry litter environment. Samples from under water lines (Wet) and from common areas away from water and feed lines (Dry) were collected from four commercial broiler houses in the Delmarva region. Over 22, 000 bacterial 16 S rRNA gene sequences were produced using 454 pyrosequencing. All 16 S amplicon sequences were assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 95 % identity level. 16 S OTU clustering by house reveals that the dominant bacterial taxa are not distributed evenly across houses. Furthermore, the distribution of OTUs between Wet and Dry litter samples also reveal dramatic differences. Comparing the most abundant OTUs from each sample type reveals a greater amount of richness and diversity in the Wet litter, with 90 % of the total abundance covered across the top 214 OTU clusters. In contrast, the top 50 clusters cover 90 % of the total abundance in the Dry litter. This increased diversity is further supported by a number of high abundance OTUs found to be derived entirely from Wet litter sequence. One house, using a modern cooling system, contained the highest number of unique OTU clusters. One of the unique clusters from this house was the sixth largest OTU cluster overall and classified as an Arcobacter sp., a potential human pathogen. Additionally, enumeration of both total virus and bacteria in litter by direct counts found a ten to one hundred-fold greater abundance compared to that found in soils. Two of the broiler houses sampled had experienced recurring outbreaks of the poultry disease gangrenous dermatitis while the other two had no history of the disease. Although the primary pathogenic Clostridial and Staphylococcal species were not found in any house, there were 13 OTUs found primarily in houses affected by recurring GD. These results provide a starting point for future studies aimed at clarifying the relationship between the microbial community of litter and poultry disease.
