5|$|Ford died on December 26, 2006, at {{his home}} in Rancho Mirage, California, of arteriosclerotic <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease and diffuse arteriosclerosis. He had end-stage {{coronary}} artery disease and severe aortic stenosis and insufficiency, caused by calcific alteration of one of his heart valves. He was 93. Ford died on the 34th anniversary of President Harry Truman's death; he was the last surviving member of the Warren Commission.|$|E
5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic <b>cerebrovascular</b> accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5|$|Goble {{suffered}} from hypertensive <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease {{and died in}} Heidelberg, Victoria, on 24 July 1948. He was cremated, leaving his wife Kathleen, and three sons. His son John (born 1923) joined the Royal Australian Navy and qualified as a pilot in the Fleet Air Arm, rising {{to the rank of}} commodore and commanding 817 Squadron, the naval air station HMAS Albatross, and the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne. Goble Street in Hughes, Australian Capital Territory, was named for Jimmy Goble. In 1994 he and Ivor McIntyre were honoured with the issue of a postage stamp by Australia Post, in a series depicting Australian aviators that also included Freda Thompson, Lawrence Hargrave, and Sir Keith and Sir Ross Macpherson Smith.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} for New Zealanders in 2012 was 84 {{years for}} females, and 80.2 years for males. Life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80 years to 85 years in 2050 and infant mortality {{is expected to}} decline. New Zealand's fertility rate of 2.1 is relatively high for a developed country, and natural births account for {{a significant proportion of}} population growth. Consequently, the country has a young population compared to most industrialised nations, with 20% of New Zealanders being 14 years old or younger. By 2050 the population is forecast to reach 5.3 million, the median age to rise from 36 years to 43 years and the percentage of people 60 years of age and older to rise from 18% to 29%. In 2008, the leading cause of premature death was cancer, at 29.8%, followed by ischaemic heart disease, 19.7%, and then <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease, 9.2%.|$|E
25|$|Tentative {{evidence}} shows a possible benefit in <b>cerebrovascular</b> diseases. The clinical experience and results so far published has promoted {{the use of}} HBO therapy in patients with <b>cerebrovascular</b> injury and focal <b>cerebrovascular</b> injuries. However, the power of clinical research is limited because of the shortage of randomized controlled trials.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{significant}} association between miscarriage and later development of coronary artery disease, but not of <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease.|$|E
25|$|Dong-A University Hospital {{is a major}} {{location}} for cardiovascular and <b>cerebrovascular</b> care in Busan-Gyeongnam region. The Cardiology Department has been offering experienced coronary intervention with case volumes ranging in the top ranks at both regional and national levels. Emergency treatment for acute myocardial infarction at DAUH is highly graded for its expedient intervention and thorough systematic algorithm specifications designed for acute coronary care. For <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease, DAUH's Stroke Center has been operating the Stroke Care Unit, {{the first of its}} kind in the region. 'CODE RED' is a coordinated response system that begins from the moment of first contact in the emergency department or outpatient clinics, through to acute treatment and neurological rehabilitation. The performance of DAUH's Cardiocerebrovascular Center led to its certification of DAMC as the primary Regional Cardio- and <b>Cerebrovascular</b> Center for Busan-Ulsan area in March 2010.|$|E
25|$|Taking vitamin D {{supplements}} {{does not}} meaningfully {{reduce the risk}} of stroke, <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease, cardial infarction, or ischaemic heart disease. Supplementation has no effect on blood pressure.|$|E

25|$|The goal of {{treatment}} of severe hypertension in pregnancy {{is to prevent}} cardiovascular, kidney, and <b>cerebrovascular</b> complications. The target blood pressure has been proposed to be 140–160 mmHg systolic and 90–105 mmHg diastolic, although values are variable.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009, Cronkite was {{reported}} to be terminally ill. He died on July 17, 2009, at his home in New York City, at the age of 92. He is believed to have died from <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease.|$|E
25|$|Ketorolac is {{contraindicated}} {{in those}} with hypersensitivity, allergies to the medication, cross-sensitivity to other NSAIDs, prior to surgery, history of peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, alcohol intolerance, renal impairment, <b>cerebrovascular</b> bleeding, nasal polyps, angioedema, and asthma.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA) reductase inhibitors, called statins, was {{a breakthrough in}} the prevention of hypercholesterolemia and related diseases. Hypercholesterolemia is considered {{to be one of the}} major risk factors for atherosclerosis which often leads to cardiovascular, <b>cerebrovascular</b> and peripheral vascular diseases.|$|E
25|$|Since {{vascular}} dementia {{is the second}} most common form of dementia (after Alzheimer's disease), reducing the risk of <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease also reduces the risk of dementia. Thus, physical exercise, having good blood cholesterol, healthy body weight and blood pressure lowers the risk of developing dementia. An active lifestyle can almost halve the risk compared to a sedentary one.|$|E
25|$|One {{meta-analysis}} found {{a decrease}} in mortality in elderly people. Another meta-analysis covering over 350,000 people concluded that vitamin D supplementation in unselected community-dwelling individuals does not reduce skeletal (total fracture) or non-skeletal outcomes (myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease, cancer) by more than 15%, and that further research trials with similar design are unlikely to change these conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Uesugi Kenshin, {{the famous}} daimyō of Echigo Province, {{was rumored to}} {{have been killed by}} a ninja. The legend credits his death to an assassin who is said to have hidden in Kenshin's lavatory, and fatally injured Kenshin by {{thrusting}} a blade or spear into his anus. While historical records showed that Kenshin suffered abdominal problems, modern historians have usually attributed his death to stomach cancer, esophageal cancer or <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease.|$|E
25|$|Other common neuropsychiatric {{manifestations of}} SLE include {{cognitive}} dysfunction, mood disorder, <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease, seizures, polyneuropathy, anxiety disorder, psychosis, depression, {{and in some}} extreme cases, personality disorders. Steroid psychosis can also occur {{as a result of}} treating the disease. It can rarely present with intracranial hypertension syndrome, characterized by an elevated intracranial pressure, papilledema, and headache with occasional abducens nerve paresis, absence of a space-occupying lesion or ventricular enlargement, and normal cerebrospinal fluid chemical and hematological constituents.|$|E
25|$|The SYNTAX {{trial was}} a {{randomized}} controlled trial of 1800 patients with multivessel coronary disease, comparing CABG versus PCI using drug-eluting stents (DES). The {{study found that}} rates of major adverse cardiac or <b>cerebrovascular</b> events at 12 months were significantly higher in the DES group (17.8% versus 12.4% for CABG; P=0.002). This was primarily driven by higher need for repeat revascularization procedures in the PCI group with no difference in repeat infarctions or survival. Higher rates of strokes were seen in the CABG group.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 Mulford {{experienced}} a devastating <b>cerebrovascular</b> accident leaving him paralyzed {{on one side}} and almost always using a wheelchair. Despite the paralysis, he continued to sketch with his good hand. He had a series of smaller strokes {{over the next four years}} before ultimately dying at his home in 1978. Following his death a memorial fund was established at the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens. The Mulford B. Foster Identification Center was established which remains to this day with the intent on furthering interest and study of the bromeliad.|$|E
25|$|Francesco M. Galassi and Hutan Ashrafian {{suggest that}} Caesar's {{behavioral}} manifestations—headaches, vertigo, falls (possibly caused by muscle weakness due to nerve damage), sensory deficit, giddiness and insensibility—and syncopal episodes were {{the results of}} <b>cerebrovascular</b> episodes, not epilepsy. Pliny the Elder reports in his Natural History that Caesar's father and forefather died without apparent cause while putting on their shoes. These events can be more readily associated with cardiovascular complications from a stroke episode or lethal heart attack. Caesar possibly had a genetic predisposition for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|As {{with any}} {{pharmacological}} or hormone treatment, there are potential side effects, {{which in the}} case of hormone therapy include changes in sexual functioning. These have the ability to significantly impact sexual functioning, either directly or indirectly through the various side effects, such as <b>cerebrovascular</b> disorders, obesity, and mood fluctuations. In addition, some research has found an onset of diabetes following feminizing hormone therapy, which impairs sexual response. Whatever route an individual and his or her doctor choose to take, {{it is important to consider}} both the medical risks of hormone therapy as well as the psychological needs of the patient.|$|E
25|$|Veganism {{appears to}} provide a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and ischemic heart disease. A 2016 {{systematic}} review found that a vegan diet {{was associated with a}} reduction in cancer risk, although only in a small number of studies. The review concluded that there was no effect of vegan diets overall on all-cause mortality, cancer mortality, <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease or cardiovascular-disease-related mortality. The effects also disappeared when specific cancers were analysed. Some studies of vegan diets in diabetes have been criticized for poorly controlling for factors such as medication status; the effect of vegan diets on diabetes and glycemic control is inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Kim Jong-il was {{reported}} by North Korean state television news on 19 December 2011. The presenter Ri Chun-hee {{announced that he had}} died on 17 December at 8:30 am of a massive heart attack while travelling by train to an area outside Pyongyang. Reportedly, he had received medical treatment for cardiac and <b>cerebrovascular</b> diseases. During the trip though, he was said to have had an advanced acute myocardial infarction, complicated with a serious heart shock. However, it {{was reported by}} South Korean media in December 2012 that he had died in a fit of rage over construction faults at a crucial power plant project.|$|E
25|$|MRI is {{the investigative}} tool {{of choice for}} {{neurological}} cancers, as it has better resolution than CT and offers better visualization of the posterior fossa. The contrast provided between grey and white matter makes MRI {{the best choice for}} many conditions of the central nervous system, including demyelinating diseases, dementia, <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease, infectious diseases, and epilepsy. Since many images are taken milliseconds apart, it shows how the brain responds to different stimuli, enabling researchers to study both the functional and structural brain abnormalities in psychological disorders. MRI also is used in mri-guided stereotactic surgery and radiosurgery for treatment of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations, and other surgically treatable conditions using a device known as the N-localizer.|$|E
25|$|During the {{afternoon}} {{session of the}} Sheffield Shield match between South Australia and New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 25 November 2014, Hughes, batting at 63 not out, was struck in the neck by the ball after missing an attempted hook shot to a bouncer from New South Wales bowler Sean Abbott. Hughes was wearing a helmet, but the ball struck an unprotected area just below his left ear. He collapsed before receiving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and was subsequently taken to St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, where he underwent surgery and was placed into an induced coma. Hughes' injury was a rare but described type of sport-related blunt-force <b>cerebrovascular</b> injury called a vertebral artery dissection which led to subarachnoid haemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|Age is a {{major risk}} factor for most common {{neurodegenerative}} diseases, including mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease, Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease. While much {{research has focused on}} diseases of aging, there are few informative studies on the molecular biology of the aging brain (usually spelled ageing brain in British English) in the absence of neurodegenerative disease or the neuropsychological profile of healthy older adults. However, research does suggest that the aging process is associated with several structural, chemical, and functional changes in the brain as well as a host of neurocognitive changes. Recent reports in model organisms suggest that as organisms age, there are distinct changes in the expression of genes at the single neuron level. This page is devoted to reviewing the changes associated with healthy aging.|$|E
25|$|The VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, {{conducted}} by Bombardier, et al., which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen, had {{indicated a significant}} 4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, RR 0.25) over the 12-month span of the study. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There {{was no significant difference}} in the mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher risk of heart attack, i.e. those meeting the criteria for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis of secondary cardiovascular events (previous myocardial infarction, angina, <b>cerebrovascular</b> accident, transient ischemic attack, or coronary artery bypass).|$|E
25|$|Hartnell reprised {{the role}} of the Doctor in Doctor Who during the tenth anniversary story The Three Doctors (1972–73). When Hartnell's wife Heather found out about his planned involvement, she {{informed}} the crew of the show that his failing memory and weakening health prevented him from starring in the special. An agreement was made between the crew and Heather that Hartnell would only be required to sit down during the shoot and read his lines from cue cards. His appearance in this story was his final piece of work as an actor. His health had worsened during the early 1970s, and in December 1974 he was admitted to hospital permanently. In early 1975 he suffered a series of strokes brought on by <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease, and died in his sleep of heart failure on 23 April 1975, at the age of 67. He was cremated and his ashes are buried at the Kent and Sussex Crematorium and Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Inuit diets derive {{approximately}} 50% {{of their}} calories from fat, 30–35% from protein and 15–20% of their calories from carbohydrates, {{largely in the}} form of glycogen from the raw meat they consumed. This high fat content provides valuable energy and prevents protein poisoning, which historically was sometimes a problem in late winter when game animals grew lean through winter starvation. It has been suggested that because the fats of the Inuit's wild-caught game are largely monounsaturated and rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the diet does not pose the same health risks as a typical Western high-fat diet. However, actual evidence has shown that Inuit have a similar prevalence of coronary artery disease as non-Inuit populations and they have excessive mortality due to <b>cerebrovascular</b> strokes, with twice the risk to that of the North American population. Indeed, the cardiovascular risk of this diet is so severe that the addition of a more standard American diet has reduced the incidence of mortality in Inuit population. Furthermore, fish oil supplement studies have failed to support claims of preventing heart attacks or strokes.|$|E
25|$|In 1895, O'Reilly married Eleanor McCulloch {{and there}} were three {{children}} of the marriage. During his wife's illness, which lasted for many years, O'Reilly had a difficult and lonely life, which was brightened by a correspondence with a cousin in England whom he had met {{when she was a}} child. His father had taken him on a visit to Europe when he was 14. His cousin was too young at the time to have any memory of him, but after the death of O'Reilly's wife in August 1914, the letters gradually developed into love-letters and in June 1917 they were married. Their letters were collected, and published in 1927 under the title of Dowell O'Reilly From his Letters, an illuminating revelation of his interesting personality. In 1920 O'Reilly made a small collection of his short stories from the Sydney Bulletin and other periodicals, and published them under the name of Five Corners. He died after a short illness of <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease and pneumonia at Leura in the Blue Mountains. He was survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter, afterwards Mrs Eleanor Dark, a leading Australian novelist.|$|E
25|$|Paleolithic peoples {{suffered}} less {{famine and}} malnutrition than the Neolithic farming tribes that followed them. This was partly because Paleolithic hunter-gatherers accessed {{a wider variety}} natural foods, which allowed them a more nutritious diet and a decreased risk of famine. Many of the famines experienced by Neolithic (and some modern) farmers were caused or amplified by their dependence on {{a small number of}} crops. It is thought that wild foods can have a significantly different nutritional profile than cultivated foods. The greater amount of meat obtained by hunting big game animals in Paleolithic diets than Neolithic diets may have also allowed Paleolithic hunter-gatherers to enjoy a more nutritious diet than Neolithic agriculturalists. It has been argued that the shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture resulted in an increasing focus on a limited variety of foods, with meat likely taking a back seat to plants. It is also unlikely that Paleolithic hunter-gatherers were affected by modern diseases of affluence such as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and <b>cerebrovascular</b> disease, because they ate mostly lean meats and plants and frequently engaged in intense physical activity, and because the average lifespan was shorter than the age of common onset of these conditions.|$|E
25|$|The first {{published}} case {{report of a}} blood clot and pulmonary embolism in a woman using Enavid (Enovid 10mg in the U.S.) at a dose of 20mg/day did not appear until November 1961, four years after its approval, by which time it had been used by over one million women. It would take almost a decade of epidemiological studies to conclusively establish {{an increased risk of}} venous thrombosis in oral contraceptive users and an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in oral contraceptive users who smoke or have high blood pressure or other cardiovascular or <b>cerebrovascular</b> risk factors. These risks of oral contraceptives were dramatized in the 1969 book The Doctors' Case Against the Pill by feminist journalist Barbara Seaman who helped arrange the 1970 Nelson Pill Hearings called by Senator Gaylord Nelson. The hearings were conducted by senators who were all men and the witnesses {{in the first round of}} hearings were all men, leading Alice Wolfson and other feminists to protest the hearings and generate media attention. Their work led to mandating the inclusion of patient package inserts with oral contraceptives to explain their possible side effects and risks to help facilitate informed consent. Today's standard dose oral contraceptives contain an estrogen dose that is one third lower than the first marketed oral contraceptive and contain lower doses of different, more potent progestins in a variety of formulations.|$|E
