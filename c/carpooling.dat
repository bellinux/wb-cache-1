5|$|Duration: For most goods, {{the longer}} a price change holds, {{the higher the}} {{elasticity}} is likely to be, {{as more and more}} consumers find they have the time and inclination to search for substitutes. When fuel prices increase suddenly, for instance, consumers may still fill up their empty tanks in the short run, but when prices remain high over several years, more consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to <b>carpooling</b> or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater fuel economy or taking other measures. This does not hold for consumer durables such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect demand to be less elastic.|$|E

When Detective Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) goes to tell Ed's son Mike (Jake O'Connor) about his father’s death, Megan stops him, telling Bud to let his mother tell him. Megan has a flashback to when she was younger, focussing on when a young Megan (Madeline Milne) receives the news of her father’s death from a policeman, as the police did not know where her mother, Joan (Joanna Cassidy), was at the time. Jen admits that she cleaned up some footprints; she thought they were Mike's. The attack on Ed was personal and after Detective Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) concludes that the attack on Ed was personal after she finds evidence to suggest Mike did indeed kill his father, such as negative emails.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} presents {{findings in}} regard to the vehicular interactions that arise when <b>carpools</b> and regular vehicles are segregated in their own lanes. Empirical evidence shows that the presence of a <b>carpool</b> lane can diminish vehicular lane-changing maneuvers near bottlenecks, which in turn can increase bottleneck discharge flows in adjacent lanes. This so-called smoothing effect is so pronounced that in many cases even an underutilized <b>carpool</b> lane can increase total bottleneck discharge flows and therefore benefit all freeway commuters and not only carpoolers. Ironically, the congested regular-use lanes are often damaging to the carpool-lane travelers. It is found that slow speeds in a <b>carpool</b> lane can be due to both, high demand for that lane and slow speeds in the adjacent regular-use lane. These findings imply that the current US policy to restrict most classes of Low-Emitting Vehicles (LEVs) from slow-moving <b>carpool</b> lanes can be counterproductive. The LEVs excluded from <b>carpool</b> lanes will thereafter contribute to congestion and slowing in the regular lanes, and this, in turn, can also reduce the speeds of those vehicles that continue to use the <b>carpool</b> lanes, despite the reduced use of those lanes. Implications for all of the above findings are discussed. This includes discussion on constructive ways to amend the new regulation, and promising strategies to increase the vehicle speeds in <b>carpool</b> lanes by improving the travel conditions in regular lanes...|$|R
40|$|The Maximum <b>Carpool</b> Matching {{problem is}} a star packing problem in {{directed}} graphs. Formally, given a directed graph G = (V, A), a capacity function c: V -> N, and a weight function w: A -> R^+, a <b>carpool</b> matching is a subset of arcs, M subseteq A, such that every v in V satisfies: (i) d^{in}_M(v) cdot d^{out}_M(v) = 0, (ii) d^{in}_M(v) <= c(v), and (iii) d^{out}_M(v) <= 1. A vertex v for which d^{out}_M(v) = 1 is a passenger, and a vertex for which d^{out}_M(v) = 0 is a driver who has d^{in}_M(v) passengers. In the Maximum <b>Carpool</b> Matching problem {{the goal is to}} find a <b>carpool</b> matching M of maximum total weight. The problem arises when designing an online <b>carpool</b> service, such as Zimride, which tries to connect between users based on a similarity function. The problem is known to be NP-hard, even in the unweighted and uncapacitated case. The Maximum Group <b>Carpool</b> Matching problem, is an extension of Maximum <b>Carpool</b> Matching where each vertex represents an unsplittable group of passengers. Formally, each vertex u in V has a size s(u) in N, and the constraint d^{in}_M(v) <= c(v) is replaced with sum_{u:(u,v) in M} s(u) <= c(v). We show that Maximum <b>Carpool</b> Matching can be formulated as an unconstrained submodular maximization problem, thus it admits a 1 / 2 -approximation algorithm. We show that the same formulation does not work for Maximum Group <b>Carpool</b> Matching, nevertheless, we present a local search (1 / 2 - epsilon) -approximation algorithm for Maximum Group <b>Carpool</b> Matching. For the unweighted variant of both problems when the maximum possible capacity, c_{max}, is bounded by a constant, we provide a local search (1 / 2 + 1 /{ 2 c_{max}} - epsilon) -approximation algorithm. We also show that the problem is APX-hard, even if the maximum degree and c_{max} are at most 3...|$|R

40|$|Real {{data show}} that reserving a lane for <b>carpools</b> on {{congested}} freeways induces a smoothing effect that is characterized by significantly higher bottleneck discharge flows (capacities) in adjacent lanes. The effect arises because disruptive vehicle lane changing diminishes {{in the presence of}} a <b>carpool</b> lane. The effect is reproducible across days and freeway sites: it was observed, without exception, in all cases tested. Queueing analysis shows that the effect greatly reduces the times spent by people and vehicles in queues. By ignoring the smoothing effect at one of the sites we analyzed, for example, one would predict that its <b>carpool</b> lane increased both the people-hours and the vehicle-hours traveled by well over 300 %; when in reality the <b>carpool</b> lane and its attendant smoothing reduced both measures. The effect is so significant, in fact, that even a severely underused <b>carpool</b> lane can in some instances increase a freeway bottleneck’s total discharge flow. This happens for the site we analyzed when <b>carpool</b> demand is as low as 1200 vph. It follows that strategies designed to induce smoothing by other means also hold promise for managing congestion, both for freeways that have <b>carpool</b> lanes and those that do not. Possible strategies of this kind are discusse...|$|R
