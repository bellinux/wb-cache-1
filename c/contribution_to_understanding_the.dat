5|$|Rothenberg's {{legacy is}} not only the generations of {{scholars}} he prepared, but also his vast historiographical <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> Revolutionary era. For many years, his Army of Francis Joseph (1976) was the standard and the only English language analysis of the Habsburg Army in the French Revolutionary and the Napoleonic wars. He changed the widespread perception of Archduke Charles' military acumen. A masterful historian, Rothenberg was known furthermore as an eminently fair scholar. After publishing a critique of a publication, the author contacted him, and proved the critique unjust; Rothenberg immediately wrote to a review retracting the criticism, and the two scholars remained friends for the remainder of his life.|$|E

His interviews are notable for their <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> mind of serial killers, with FBI profiler John E. Douglas describing Kemper as [...] "among the brightest prison inmates" [...] he ever interviewed and capable of [...] "rare insight for a violent criminal." [...] Kemper is also forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has said that he participated in the interviews to save others like himself from killing; stating {{at the end of his}} Murder: No Apparent Motive interview: [...] "There's somebody out there that is watching this and hasn't done that – hasn't killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure they have it under control. They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and talk about something that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's a horrible thing, it doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts." [...] He also conducted an interview with French writer Stéphane Bourgoin in 1991.|$|E
