40|$|Today, {{procedure}} of creating bachelor and master thesis suffers from many problems. Amongst them {{the main issue}} would consist of absence of central storage ability connected to creating and couching the thesis. In practice that would mean information about records from consultation, comments to thesis etc. are to be lost and neither student, nor his thesis couch can take a look {{to the history of}} thesis progress. Furthermore, {{there is a lack of}} date registration for <b>consultations</b> and <b>deadlines</b> of handing out thesis. As a consequence, both efficiency and quality of final thesis are decreased by such poor management. As a solution, support of whole thesis procedure with software tool is suggested. There are many options of such software solutions, however only one is the most suitable and that is exactly what this thesis is trying to find. Thesis formulates requirements for such software application, after the analysis of current situation and identification of core issues. Application should bring improvement of the situation and at the same time should be users, operational and financially acceptable. From wide spectrum of available solutions, only those which had fulfilled basic conditions were chosen. Basic conditions such as: users interface in Czech language, saving documents availability and large capacity of users accounts. Final group of potential solutions was put through detail analysis for support utility for thesis couching. This analysis finally shows the most suitable solution. This bachelor thesis brings analysis of utility for commonly available web application or hosted applications for bachelor and diploma thesis couching. The implementation could be done quickly without further problems, thanks to the undemanding IT and financial requirements of software application. After finding the most suitable solution, this thesis shows how large scale of efficiency Microsoft SharePoint Services 3. 0 brings. Furthermore, at the end of this thesis, many more options for using this application are shown...|$|R
