40|$|AbstractThe {{notion of}} {{confluence}} is prevalent in graph transformation systems (GTS) {{as well as}} constraint handling rules (CHR). This work presents a generalized embedding of GTS in CHR that allows to consider strong derivations in <b>confluence</b> <b>analyses.</b> Confluence of a terminating CHR program is decidable, whereas confluence of a terminating GTS is undecidable. We show that observable confluence in CHR coincides with a sufficient criterion for confluence of the embedded GTS. For this purpose the automatic confluence check for CHR can be reused...|$|E

Distinguishing features of our type system are: it can verify lock-freedom of concurrent {{programs that have}} sophisticated re-cursive communication structures; it can be fully automated; it is hybrid, in that it combines a type system for lock-freedom with lo-cal reasoning about deadlock-freedom, termination, and <b>confluence</b> <b>analyses.</b> Moreover, the type system is parameterized by deadlock-freedom/termination/confluence analyses, so that any methods (e. g. type systems and model checking) {{can be used for}} those analyses. A lock-freedom analysis tool has been implemented based on the proposed type system, and tested for non-trivial programs. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{exploratory}} <b>confluence</b> {{framework for}} <b>analysing</b> mathematical problem solving in socially {{different educational contexts}} is introduced. The central premise of the framework is that a key solution idea to a problem can be constructed by a solver {{as a result of}} shifts of attention that come from individual effort, interaction with peer problem solvers or interaction with a source of knowledge about the solution. The framework consolidates some existing theoretical developments and aims at addressing the perennial educational challenge of helping students become more effective problem solvers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the politics}} surrounding the Syrian refugee crisis in Jordan, the country that, along with Lebanon, hosts the largest Syrian refugee population {{in relation to}} its overall population. It focuses in particular on the significance of policy legacies and policy memories for shaping perceptions of Syrian refugees and practices of managing them. It {{is based on the}} hypothesis that past experiences with large influxes of Palestinian and Iraqi refugees in Jordan have shaped the Syria refugee response as much as the policy blueprints and professional experiences of international and national humanitarian and development actors present in Jordan, as well as other actors, including refugees themselves. The paper illustrates this <b>confluence</b> by <b>analysing</b> two salient aspects of the response: the numerous contradictory ways in which Syrian refugees are counted; and the shaping of labour regulations, particularly the negotiations around providing work permits for Syrians. It argues that in all cases, overlapping regulations and ambivalences, which stem from assembled policy legacies and memories, have been key to ‘policy success’, {{in the sense that they}} have made it possible to tie a heterogeneous set of agencies and actors together and create a semblance of coherence...|$|R
40|$|Classic {{descriptions}} of drainage patterns suggest that confluence angle {{is determined by}} the shape of the drainage basin unless constraining factors, such as the geological structure, affect stream flow. Downstream changes in channel width below tributary junctions have long been associated with tributary inputs of flow and sediment. Analysis of tributary junction geometry and channel width changes in large rivers and over large reaches is sparse. The Lower Mekong Basin exhibits a generally dendritic drainage network despite flowing through a diverse array of geological settings. Publicly available SPOT- 5 imagery from Google Earth was used to identify and catalogue junction geometries and downstream changes in channel width below tributary junctions along a ~ 2200 ?km reach of the Mekong River. Of the 284 junctions identified, the majority (66. 2 %) were acute. However 12 (4. 8 %) were found to be normal (90 °) and 75 (30 %) were found to be obtuse. This latter number is in contrast to previous studies over similar spatial scales which found little evidence of obtuse junctions. Meander extension of the incoming tributary and deflection of the tributary across bedrock shoulders were found to be the dominant geomorphological causes of obtuse tributary junctions. The relationship between the width of the tributary channels and the width of the mainstem upstream and downstream of the <b>confluences</b> was <b>analysed.</b> It was observed that, over the whole reach, a slight narrowing occurred immediately below tributary junctions. Although the changes themselves were small, the slight net narrowing is shown to be statistically significant. The observed relationship is shown to vary considerably with geology. The geological control suggests that complex factors play important roles in determining changes to channel width across large systems and that simple cause–effect relationships do not hold in such complicated geological setting...|$|R
40|$|In 2009, London Overground {{management}} {{implemented a}} new tactical plan for a. m. and p. m. peak {{service on the}} North London Line (NLL). This paper documents that tactical planning intervention and evaluates its outcomes in terms of certain aspects of service delivery (the operator's perspective on system performance) and service quality (the passenger's perspective). Analyses of service delivery and quality and of passenger demand contributed to the development, proposal, {{and implementation of the}} new tactical plan. NLL trains were delayed routinely en route, with excessive dwell time a major cause. Near-random passenger incidence behavior suggested that an even headway service for NLL might have been more appropriate. The <b>confluence</b> of these <b>analyses</b> was confirmed by the corresponding excess journey time results. On the basis of longitudinal analysis, an evaluation showed that on-time performance increased substantially and observed journey time decreased with the introduction of the new plan. Overall, the effects of this implementation appeared to have been positive on balance. This case study thus demonstrated the applicability of automatic data generally, and certain measures and techniques in the London Overground specifically, to support the tactical planning of an urban railway.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ascorbate}} on the glycosaminoglycans synthesized by normal and simian virus 40 (SV 40) -transformed human skin fibroblasts was examined. Cells were incubated {{in the presence}} or absence of ascorbate, and radiolabelled with [3 H]glucosamine and [35 S]sulphate for 48 h, 3 days after reaching <b>confluence.</b> Glycosaminoglycans were <b>analysed</b> in the medium, a collagenase extract, and in the trypsin/cell-associated fraction. Hyaluronic acid was the main 3 H-labelled glyco-saminoglycan in all but the collagenase extracts, and showed a large decrease in normal fibroblast cultures, but a significant increase in SV 40 -transformed fibroblast cultures following feeding with ascorbate. Incorporation of [3 H]glucosamine into sulphated glycosaminoglycans was reduced in normal fibroblast cultures but increased slightly in SV 40 -transformed cultures following ascorbate supplementation. [35 S]sulphate incorporation remained essentially unaltered in both cell cultures. Ascorbate stimulated the deposition of glycosaminoglycans into the insoluble matrix of normal fibroblasts while reducing the deposition in SV 40 -transformed fibroblast cultures. The observed changes may in part be related to ascorbate-induced deposition of collagen in normal fibroblast cultures and the inability of the transformed fibroblast cells to deposit an extensive extra-cellular matrix, in addition to possible changes in the specific activity of the UDP-iV-acetyl-[3 H]hexosamine pool...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. Retinitis pigmentosa {{is a form}} of {{inherited}} retinal degeneration, {{whereby the}} rod photoreceptors are gradually lost. Patients usually manifest symptoms in the third decade of life, beginning with night blindness and loss of peripheral vision gradually progressing to tunnel vision and eventually complete blindness, as cone photoreceptors die as a secondary effect. Mutations causing non-syndromic, autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) were recently identified in TOPORS (RP 31 locus, chromosome 9 p 21. 1). TOPORS is a ubiquitously expressed gene, encoding a protein showing multi-functional character. It is currently the only known protein to demonstrate E 3 ligase activity for both ubiquitin and SUMO- 1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier). It also shows tumor-suppressor activity. The {{purpose of this study is}} to characterize the role of TOPORS in the retina, in particular in the photoreceptor cells, which may explain the retinal degeneration seen with mutations in this gene. METHODS. To identify the functional consequences of the mutations TOPORS was cloned from human retinal cDNA into FLAG-tagged vector pCATCH, identified mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis and transfected into MDCK cells. Over-expressed TOPORS was detected using an antibody directed against the FLAG-tag. Functional analyses of WT lymphoblastoid cell lines and specifically generated patient cell lines was also conducted using the TOPORS antibody. A commercially available antibody was obtained and used for immunofluorescent staining of endogenous topors in a number of cell lines, and in mouse, pig and human retinal sections. Tissue sections were costained for TOPORS with several proteins of known localisation in the retina (for example, RP 1 and γ-tubulin), to ascertain a more detailed localisation of TOPORS and to indicate potential interactants. Cellular localisation experiments were carried out in cell lines on a single cell level to determine the exact sub-cellular localisation. To identify functional partners of TOPORS, immuno-precipitation experiments were carried out to substantiate data obtained from localisation studies in retinal sections. RESULTS. Both mutations in TOPORS result in frameshift, prematurely terminating the protein; however this appeared to make no difference to the nuclear localization of the over-expressed WT and mutants proteins. Work on the patient lymphoblastoid cell lines showed that the mutant protein is not expressed although the mutant mRNA is detectable by RT-PCR. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the expression of TOPORS as a 150 kDa band in cell lines and retinal tissue extracts. Localisation studies showed a novel localisation for TOPORS in the retina and in confluent, non-diving cells. TOPORS localised to the connecting cilium of the photoreceptors in retinal sections, and to the primary cilia of cells grown at <b>confluence.</b> Further <b>analyses</b> showed that it co-localizes with γ-tubulin to the base of the cilium, to the basal body. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that TOPORS does not interact with many known connecting cilium proteins although it has a similar localization pattern. It did not show interaction with proteins involved in anterograde transport. However, TOPORS does show interaction with some of the protein subunits involved in retrograde transport. CONCLUSIONS. Topors is a multi-functional, ubiquitously expressed gene however mutations in it only cause retinal degeneration (adRP). Results suggest that the mutant proteins are not expressed in patients, hence haplo-insuffiency is likely to be the cause of retinal degeneration. TOPORS is expressed in many cell and tissue types, and is primarily a nuclear protein. However, it shows a unique localisation in the retina - to the base of the connecting cilium in the photoreceptors. Similarly, in ciliated cells, topors localised to the base of the primary cilium which was confirmed by co-localisation with γ-tubulin. The co-IP experiments confirmed its interaction with γ-tubulin and also showed that topors associates with protein involved in retrograde transport. This together suggests it plays a novel role in the retina, possibly related to signal transduction and/or trafficking, that when compromised, results in specific photoreceptor degeneration...|$|R
40|$|The Deûle River is {{a highly}} {{polluted}} River by heavy metals caused by the historical discharges of ore minerals from the former ore smelter “Metaleurop. ” The potential mercury (Hg) pollution in the Deûle River implicates the importance of Hg distribution study in the river. As well as to configure the different biogeochemical factors that control the distribution and the potential transport of Hg to distant places. Four different sites were studied as follows: D-A (Deûle River, a site located upstream the river), D-B (Deûle River, a site located near a Zn, Pb, Cu, and Ni smelter that closed in 2003), L-C (Lys River, a site located upstream {{the confluence of the}} Deûle River with Lys River), and L-D (downstream the rivers <b>confluence).</b> Different Hg <b>analyses</b> were performed including total mercury in sediment (HgT S), methylmercury (MeHg) in sediment, total mercury in pore water (HgT PW), total mercury in surface water (HgT D), and total suspended particulate Hg in water (HgT P). HgT S decreases downstream from the Deûle River sites with a mean value of 11 [*]±[*] 0. 34 mg/kg to Lys River site (L-D) with a mean value of 0. 53 [*]±[*] 0. 02 mg/kg at the confluence. The unaffected side of the Lys River, localized before the confluence (L-C), is characterized by low HgT S of an average value of 0. 042 [*]±[*] 0. 003 mg/kg and high % MeHg reaching 4. 2 %. Whereas, the highly contaminated Deûle sites are designated by low % MeHg with an average value of 0. 053 %. Low pristine environments like that found in L-C site with more favorable biogeochemical conditions of lower concentrations of HgT S, sulfides, and Corg host more active biotic methylation than that of the highly polluted Deûle sites with high concentrations of HgT S and sulfides concentrations. Methylation in D-B (the closet site to Metaleurop smelter) is an old and recent methylation activity that has contributed to MeHg accumulation in the sediments as opposed to the exclusive recent events of methylation in Lys sites. MeHg in all sites is produced in situ rather than exported from other potential sources confirmed by significant relations of % MeHg with %Corg and AVS. Hg pollution is transported from the Deûle River to the Lys River (L-C and L-D) through suspended particles leached or remobilized from the River catchment. The dominance of reducing conditions in the Deûle River attributed to higher sulfide concentration has contributed to higher HgT PW than the Lys sites. Diffusive fluxes of HgT from sediment to water column for the Deûle and Lys River sites (L-C and L-D) were estimated to be 224, 53, and 2 ng/cm 2 year, respectively...|$|R

Da bi fenomenološko določili sovisnosti med integralnimi parametri vodnih tokov in lastnostmi stoječega valovanja na območju sotočja, smo najprej izvedli meritve topografije vodne gladine za 168 kombinacij dveh tokov (scenarijev na sotočju). Za meritve prečnega poteka gladine smo uporabili lasersko skeniranje, ki kot sodobna brezkontaktna merilna tehnika omogoča meritve pojavov z veliko dinamiko ter prostorsko in časovno ločljivostjo. Kljub razširjenosti laserskega skeniranja pa to za zajem topografije gladine čiste vode, brez dodanih primesi, plovcev ipd., še ni bilo uporabljeno. Zaradi narave interakcije med laserskimi žarki in gladino vodnih teles smo v prvem delu raziskali, ali % in pod kakšnimi pogoji % je lasersko skeniranje uporabno za zajem topografije vodne gladine. S primerjavo teh meritev z referenčnimi vrednostmi drugačnih merilnih tehnik smo potrdili prvo hipotezo, da je % tako pri laboratorijskih kot tudi terenskih meritvah % mogoče z laserskim skeniranjem zelo natančno zajeti potek vodne gladine predvsem razburkanih, dvofaznih tokov z veliko vertikalno dinamiko, torej kompleksnejših hidravličnih pojavov, kjer so druge merilne metode manj uspešne oziroma neuporabne. V drugem delu smo uporabili sistematične meritve vodne gladine po prerezih na območju sotočja pri vseh scenarijih za določitev srednjega poteka gladine in z izdelavo mrežnih modelov izdelali topografije stoječega valovanja. S tem smo pridobili pomembno podlago za analizo topologije sotočja. Rezultati so potrdili drugo hipotezo, da je mogoče zapisati fenomenološke zveze med vhodnimi, geometrijskimi in hidravličnimi parametri tokov ter glavnimi značilnostmi vodnih struktur, ki se pojavljajo na sotočjih pri deročem toku. Nove fenomenološko izpeljane enačbe, ki opisujejo prečni in vzdolžni potek gladin ter tudi višino fluktuacij, opišejo topologijo vodne gladine v ustrezni meri ter tako prinašajo informacije o procesih in njihovi magnitudi, ki so pomembne za inženirsko prakso.
