It deals with the production technology of the part using various sheet metal materials of different surface finish. The most suitable solution has been found in using a cutting and a bending press. The chosen production method has been evaluated with regard to technological difficulties connected to processing thus modified sheet metal as well as with regard to economical cost of the production. Forming processes have been executed using a TRUMPF TC 200 R <b>cutting</b> <b>press,</b> having a nominal shearing force of 165 kN, and URSVIKEN Optiflex bending press, having a nominal pressing force of 1300 kN. Forming tools are optimally chosen according to the parameters of individual types of sheet metal. At the end the project evaluated the most convenient material to produce this part...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{evolution}} of micorelectronics is placing greater {{demands on the}} packaging technology of integrated circuits (IC), the trend being towards higher lead counts, smaller lead width, finer lead pitch and thinner leadframes. These demands impose stringent requirements {{on the quality of}} dam-bar cutting, the latter being a mechanical trimming process in which the dam bar btween the leads of an IC package after post-molding process is pierced out. The leadframe thickness and the area of cutting are in the order of one tenth of a millimeter and cutting is performed at a much higher speed than that found in conventional blanking and piercing processes. In this work, a purposely built single-punch dam-bar <b>cutting</b> <b>press</b> was constructed. The effects of percentage punch-die clearance, punch shear and the plastic anisotropy of the leadframe materials on the cutting force and energy, {{and the quality of the}} sheared edge of the dam-bar, were studied. The optimum punch-die clearance for minimum cutting energy was established. The cutting force, energy and burr height were found to be affected by the plastic anisotropy of the virgin leadframe materials. These findings can be applied in the design of trimming tools used in the dam-bar cutting of IC packages. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
