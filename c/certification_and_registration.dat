Universal suffrage was introduced in Azerbaijan in 1918 by the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, thus making Azerbaijan the first Muslim-majority countries and Turk-majority countries ever to enfranchise women. Now, 28 women are members in the Azerbaijan Parliament (Milli Məclis). As of 2015, there were 21 women in the 125-seat parliament. The percentage of female members of parliament increased from 11 to 17 percent between 2005 and 2015. Traditional social norms and lagging economic development in the country’s rural regions continued to restrict {{the role of women}} in the economy, and there were reports that women had difficulty exercising their legal rights due to gender discrimination. As of May 2009, women held the positions of Deputy Chairman of the Constitutional Court, Deputy Chairman of the Nakhchivan AR Cabinet of Ministers, four Deputy Ministers, an Ambassador, and Ombudsmen of Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan AR. Women constituted 4 of the 16 members of the Central Election Commission and chaired of 3 of the 125 district election commissions.

DESIGN [...] A long term cohort study established to receive details of death <b>certification</b> <b>and</b> tumour <b>registrations</b> through the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and NHS central register. PATIENTS [...] All patients (1246 male, 662 female) treated for short stature with pituitary growth hormone under the Medical Research Council working party and health services human growth hormone committee. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Death or development of neoplasia. RESULTS [...] 110 patients died (68 male, 42 female; aged 0. 9 - 57 years) from 1972 to 1990. Fifty three death were from neoplasia responsible for growth hormone deficiency (27 craniopharyngioma, 24 other intracranial tumour, two leukaemia); two from histiocytosis X; and 13 from pituitary insufficiency. Six patients died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, six of other neurological disorders, and eight of acute infection. Other deaths were apparently unrelated to growth hormone deficiency or its treatment. Seventeen tumours (in 16 patients) were identified during or after growth hormone treatment. Four were in patients with previous intracranial neoplasia and two were after cranial irradiation. Thirteen were intracranial, the others being Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, carcinoma of colon, and basal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS [...] Recurrence or progression of intracranial tumours and potentially avoidable metabolic consequences of hypopituitarism were the main causes of death. Growth hormone treatment probably did not contribute to new tumour development. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after pituitary growth hormone treatment continues to occur in the United Kingdom.

The experimental factors included five seed sizes (2 - 2. 2, 2. 2 - 2. 5, 2. 5 - 2. 8, 2. 8 - 3 and> 3 mm) and three wheat cultivars (Mahdavi, Pishtaz and Bahar). The experiment {{was carried out in}} a 3 × 5 factorial design (three cultivars, five different seed sizes) based on randomized complete blocks with three replicates. Seedling emergence percentage, green weight of 100 plants, dry weight of 100 plants, the number of spikes per area, number of seeds per spike, 1000 - seeds weight and grain yield were measured. Seed size {{had a significant impact on}} all of measured traits with the exception of 1000 - seeds weight. Results indicated that number of seeds per spike significantly decreased by increasing seed size. The other traits showed significant increase by increasing seed size. Cultivar had significant effect on 1000 - seeds weight and number of spikes per area but other traits were similar among cultivars.

40|$|Organic farms face {{numerous}} challenges {{unique to}} organic production {{that can lead}} to cessation of the farm business or conversion to conventional production. In California, one of the leading U. S. states for organic production, all producers of commodities marketed as organic are required to register with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Organic Program. The purpose of this survey study was to compare farmers who had recently discontinued their registration with the program with farmers still registered, to determine whether deregistered farmers leave farming altogether or convert to conventional production, and to shed light on the main challenges faced by organic farmers. Results indicate 26 % of those identified as deregistered were mistakenly identified as such (due to late submissions, name changes, or other reasons), and 35 % had stopped farming altogether. Significantly fewer actually deregistered farmers owned their own land than still registered producers, and a significantly higher percentage had farm revenues lower than US$ 100, 000. Deregistered producers considered regulatory issues as the most problematic, especially paperwork requirements, while registered producers ranked production issues as most problematic. Accordingly, registered farmers were more likely to request technical production assistance in the form of organic-focused research and extension, while deregistered farmers responded that financial assistance with <b>certification</b> <b>and</b> <b>registration</b> costs and more streamlining and clarification of the certification process and organic rules would have helped them more as organic farmers. These results point to a continuing need for certification cost share programs, especially for small farms, and streamlining of regulatory procedures. Additional strategies to retain more organic farmers include trained organic advisors who can facilitate between farmers and certifying and regulatory agencies, more organic-focused research, and producer cooperatives for small organic farms to pool information and labor resources and marketing efforts...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} paper is meant as an exploratory empirical research project. The {{objective was to}} query {{a small sample of}} active community interpreters on a limited set of key dimensions concerning their own perception of the profession. Sixty anonymous self-report questionnaires were sent out via 12 interpreting agencies, generating nineteen responses. Because of its exploratory nature, the questionnaire was mainly made up of open-ended questions. These were subsequently conceptualized through content analysis by post-categorization. Three main themes were explored: the perception of the professional image and role of community interpreters, their views on quality and their views on a professional code of conduct and, specifically, on impartiality. The interpreters perceive themselves as having an important role in society and also as being perceived as such by others. But as yet that reality is not translated into due respect and appreciation, proper remuneration and legal recognition of the profession. Training, of community interpreters as well as of social workers, is seen as the most important and effective factor of a quality label for community interpreting, more so than the more formal elements of <b>certification</b> <b>and</b> <b>registration.</b> Formal education at Master’s level was deemed less important by our respondents. Supervision is seen as a valuable means of in-service training and general quality improvement. The respondents who already had some form of (basic or introductory) training were convinced that above all training and external assessment are necessary for quality improvement. The Flemish community interpreters seem to perceive of a professional code of conduct as mainly externally motivated: it is imposed and assessed by the interpreting agencies, through the evaluations of the other parties in the triad. On the specific topic of impartiality, a majority of respondents profess to a strict adherence to the professional code of conduct. status: publishe...|$|E

When the engines were shut down, the pilot moved the rudder to maximum deflection to counter the resulting yaw. The Stratoliner then experienced rudder lock, where the control loads prevented the rudder from being re-centered. As a result, the 307 went into a spin and crashed. The ten people aboard, including KLM test pilot Albert von Baumhauer, Boeing test pilot Julius Barr, Boeing Chief Aerodynamicist Ralph Cram, Boeing Chief Engineer Earl Ferguson, and a TWA representative were killed. Subsequent wind tunnel testing showed that the addition of an extended dorsal fin ahead of and attached to the vertical tail prevented rudder lock.
