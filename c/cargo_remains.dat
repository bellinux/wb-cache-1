40|$|SummaryA {{regulated}} {{mechanism of}} cargo loading {{is crucial for}} intracellular transport. N-cadherin, a synaptic adhesion molecule that is critical for neuronal function, must be precisely transported to dendritic spines in response to synaptic activity and plasticity. However, the mechanism of activity-dependent <b>cargo</b> loading <b>remains</b> unclear. To elucidate this mechanism, we investigated the activity-dependent transport of N-cadherin via its transporter, KIF 3 A. First, by comparing KIF 3 A-bound cargo vesicles with unbound KIF 3 A, we identified critical KIF 3 A phosphorylation sites and specific kinases, PKA and CaMKIIa, using quantitative phosphoanalyses. Next, mutagenesis and kinase inhibitor experiments revealed that N-cadherin transport was enhanced via phosphorylation of the KIF 3 A C terminus, thereby increasing cargo-loading activity. Furthermore, N-cadherin transport was enhanced during homeostatic upregulation of synaptic strength, triggered by chronic inactivation by TTX. We propose the first model of activity-dependent cargo loading, in which phosphorylation of the KIF 3 A C terminus upregulates the loading and transport of N-cadherin in homeostatic synaptic plasticity...|$|R

40|$|SummaryEarly in infection, {{adenovirus}} {{travels to}} the nucleus as a naked capsid using the microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein.

We find that cytoplasmic dynein and its associated proteins dynactin and NudE/NudEL, but not LIS 1 or ZW 10, colocalized with incoming, postendosomal adenovirus particles. However, in contrast to physiological cargos, dynein binding to adenovirus was independent of these dynein-associated proteins. Dynein itself directly interacted through its intermediate and light intermediate chains with the adenovirus capsid subunit hexon in a pH-dependent manner. Expression of hexon or injection of anti-hexon antibody inhibited virus transport but not physiological dynein function. These results identify hexon as a direct receptor for cytoplasmic dynein and demonstrate that hexon recruits dynein for transport to the nucleus by a mechanism distinct from that for physiological dynein cargo...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The minus end–directed {{microtubule}} motor cytoplasmic dynein transports vari-ous cellular cargoes, including early endosomes, but how dynein binds to its <b>cargo</b> <b>remains</b> unclear. Recently fungal Hook homologues {{were found}} to link dynein to early endosomes for their transport. Here we identified FhipA in Aspergillus nidulans as a key player for HookA (A. nidulans Hook) function via a genome-wide screen for mutants defective in early-endosome distribution. The human homologue of FhipA, FHIP, is a protein in the previously discovered FTS/Hook/FHIP (FHF) complex, which contains, besides FHIP and Hook proteins, Fused Toes (FTS). Although this complex was not previously shown {{to be involved in}} dynein-mediated transport, we show here that loss of either FhipA or FtsA (A. nidulans FTS homo-logue) disrupts HookA–early endosome association and inhibits early endosome movement. Both FhipA and FtsA associate with early endosomes, and interestingly, while FtsA–early endosome association requires FhipA and HookA, FhipA–early endosome association is inde-pendent of HookA and FtsA. Thus FhipA is more directly linked to early endosomes than HookA and FtsA. However, in the absence of HookA or FtsA, FhipA protein level is signifi-cantly reduced. Our results indicate that all three proteins in the FtsA/HookA/FhipA complex are important for dynein-mediated early endosome movement...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{regulate}} the biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profile of therapeutic <b>cargo</b> <b>remains</b> a challenge for biomedical research. This lack in precisely modulating the in vivo fate of drug and gene cargo following administration diminishes potency, challenges safety, and ultimately plagues the likelihood of therapeutic efficacy. Catalyzed by Richard Feynman’s 1959 lecture “Plenty of Room at the Bottom” and K. Eric Drexler’s prominent vision of molecular manufacturing, the field of nanotechnology has undergone exponential growth in both interest and application. Specifically, the use of nanotechnology in medicine is an emerging area that demonstrates great promise in drug delivery. The chief ambition of applying nanoscale principles in drug delivery is to mask the unfavorable characteristics of therapeutic cargo with the tunable properties of the nanocarrier. This effectively decouples the therapeutic mechanism of the drug from its in-transit behavior. Although substantial progress has been made, the ability to facilitate potency while circumventing toxicity remains elusive. To advance the field of “nanomedicine”, this dissertation focuses on developing a lipid nanocarrier that can achieve robust spatiotemporal control of therapeutic cargo. ^ The lipid nanoparticle (LNP) system was engineered from biocompatible components and surface functionalized with hyaluronic acid (HA) to endow the decorated particles (HALNPs) with colloidal stability, high cargo entrapment, and the salient feature of active targeting for cell-specific uptake. Following optimization, the HALNP system was successfully employed for breast cancer therapy via targeted delivery of microRNA. This was the first study to use microRNA in combination with a translational nanocarrier as a standalone treatment for HER 2 positive breast cancer. In a separate application, the targeting potential of the HALNPs was tested {{for the treatment of}} glioblastoma. This study validated that the HALNPs promoted preferential uptake into cancer cells over corresponding healthy brain tissue and demonstrated a novel chemotherapeutic delivery method. The HALNP platform was also used with an in vitro mechanobiology model to determine how changes in local microenvironment during cancer progression alter the functionality of targeting ligands to create smarter nanocarriers. Lastly, a novel substrate delivery platform comprising of HALNP embedded thin film assemblies was developed for the future creation of implantable devices. ...|$|E

Although excavation still continues, with tentative plans of completion in 1998, this document analyzes {{data collected from}} the 1991 and 1992 seasons. Commonly referred to as 'The Pipe Wreck," owing to the large consignment of clay tobacco smoking pipes carried as <b>cargo,</b> the <b>remains</b> of the vessel add a substantial corpus of information to our scant knowledge of seventeenth-century shipwrecks in the New World. The investigation of the extant hull and cargo was undertaken {{to test the hypothesis}} that the wreck represents a Dutch merchantman headed for a Dutch-American outpost in the New World. Preliminary results of the excavation and subsequent study seasons, however, suggest that the vessel was English-built and sank sometime, most likely, between 1652 and 1656. Dendrochronological studies, clay pipe morphologies and their accompanying maker's marks. ceramic types, and counterstamped silver coins fit well into this temporal framework. Historical and archaeological data suggest that the wreck represents an English merchant vessel bound for the northeastern seaboard of what is now the United States. The possibility exists, however, that it sailed {{in the service of the}} Dutch West India Company. Additional hypotheses examine the likelihood that the ship may have entered Monte Cristi Bay in search of salt, or perhaps to trade with the boucaniers that were prevalent along the northern coast of Hispaniola. A major portion of the cargo appears to have been manufactured in Holland, and archaeological collections from contemporary sites suggest that many items were intended for the Native American trade in the Hudson River Valley.

We also found that the interaction between mutant SOD 1 and the dynein motor {{played a critical role in}} the formation of large inclusions containing mutant SOD 1. In this study, we showed that, in contrast to the dynein situation, mutant SOD 1 did not interact with anterograde transport motors of the kinesin- 1 family (KIF 5 A, B and C). Using dynein and kinesin accumulation at the sciatic nerve ligation sites as a surrogate measurement of axonal transport, we also showed that dynein mediated retrograde transport was slower in G 93 A than in WT mice at an early pre-symptomatic stage. While no decrease in KIF 5 A-mediated anterograde transport was detected, the anterograde transport of dynein heavy chain as a cargo was observed in the pre-symptomatic G 93 A mice. The results from this study along with other recently published work support that mutant SOD 1 might only interact with and interfere with some kinesin members which in turn could result in the impairment of a selective subset of <b>cargos.</b> Although it <b>remains</b> to be further investigated how mutant SOD 1 affect different axonal transport motor proteins and various cargos, it is evident that mutant SOD 1 can induce defects in axonal transport, which subsequently contribute to the propagation of toxic effects and ultimately motor neuron death in ALS...|$|R

To design a new port, information is needed about future trade and traffic anticipated in the future. An {{effort was made to}} make some forecasts in order to render this report more realistic. The produced forecasts are bases on a combination of past data extrapolation, trade and traffic trends as well as insight in the situation of Albania and hinterland connections. The master plan duration, which will be 25 years (2010 - 2035), is divided into three periods. Three different growth scenarios were taken into account. This report has been based on the medium growth scenario (4. 3 %, 3. 8 % and 3. 1 % increase in the total trade of Albania in tons for the three time periods respectively). Assuming a medium growth scenario 1, 807, 000 tons of dry bulk will be handled in Porto Romano in 2035, 774, 000 tons liquid bulk, 1, 033, 000 tons general cargo and 215, 111 TEUs. When Romano Port starts functioning, it is immediately able to accommodate container vessels up to 45, 000 dwt. For dry bulk it is assumed that the port should be able to accommodate vessels up to 40, 000 dwt. The General Cargo vessels which currently enter the port of Durrës have an average size of 4, 000 dwt. Although in general the size of General <b>Cargo</b> vessels <b>remains</b> relative small the average ship is expected to increase up to 10, 000 dwt in 2035, with a maximum of 15, 000 dwt. The maximum ship size for the liquid bulk terminal is assumed at 25, 000 dwt. Taking into account the above forecasts, the future needs concerning terminal areas, berths and equipment were depicted. The container terminal will require a storage area of 440, 000 m 2 and a berth length of 466 meter. Dry bulk needs an area of 62, 000 m 2 and a berth length of 240 meter. General cargo will require a storage area of 84, 000 m 2 and a berth length of 543 meter. For the liquid bulk terminal, no additional berth is required. Ten alternatives were generated based on the future needs above. Three of them were discussed in more detail. Several affecting parameters were taken into account like extensibility, tranquillity, manoeuvrability etc. The comparison among these alternatives was conducted {{with the help of a}} multi criteria analyses. The objectivity of this method was verified by doing several sensitivity checks. Finally it leads to a final optimum port layout. Two chapters are written about the breakwater and quay wall. After an analysis, where several breakwater types were discussed and a comparison between a caisson type and rubble mound breakwater was made, the rubble mound breakwater appeared to be the preferred solution. The breakwater armour layer is designed using a single layer of Accropode ll elements. A concrete unit is selected because the required weight of the armour units is substantially larger than the available 2 ton rock in the quarry nearby. For the quay wall, an open pile construction has been selected. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
