Methods: A total of 70 Wistar Albino female rats with a mean weight 213 ± 27 g were randomly divided into equal seven groups. The first group (C) underwent no procedure. The second group (RT) underwent the whole thoracic radiation including heart. The third group (T) was adminis-tered T through tail vein alone. The fourth group (RT+T+Tx) was administered T initially and the whole thoracic radiation at two hours, followed by tamoxifen at one week. The fifth group (RT+T+Le) was administered T and then underwent thoracic radiation, followed by letrozole. The sixth group (T+RT+An) was administered T and then underwent thoracic radiation, followed by anastrazole. The seventh group (T+RT+Ex) was admin-istered T and then underwent thoracic radiation, followed by exemestane at one week. Hormonotherapy was administered to the rats in the Group 5, 6 and 7, as indicated in the Group 4. Radiation therapy was administered following T treatment at two hours as a single 12 Gy fraction. After the rats were sedated under anesthesia and sacrificed at 24 weeks, cardiac tissues were removed.

Hence, we aimed {{to determine the}} presence of lead and mercury in selected soaps commonly used in Mashhad, northeastern Iran. Methods: Different common brands of cosmetic, hygiene and contraband soaps were purchased from retail market of Mashhad in 2016. Levels of these metals were determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy technique. Results: All samples had the mercury and lead levels but did not exceed the maximum acceptable level (1 µg/g for mercury and 20 µg/g for lead) recommended by FDA. The mean levels of mercury were 0. 02, 0. 08 and 0. 23 µg/g, respectively in cosmetic, hygiene and contraband soaps. These levels for lead were 0. 10, 0. 19 and 0. 13 µg/g. The highest mercury and lead levels were detected in Halazoon contraband and P hygiene brands, respectively.

40|$|Locally {{advanced}} {{breast cancer}} is a specific clinic entity, comprising various degrees of breast cancer local and regional extension. This term is applied to nonmetastatic large primary tumors (including inflammatory breast carcinoma), with or without extensive regional lymph node involvement, with a rapid or slow evolution, and usually with poor prognosis. This clinical presentation of mammary carcinoma is common in developing countries (30 % to 60 %), but also with a remarkable incidence in developed countries (10 % to 20 %). During many decades patients were treated with radical surgery or radiation therapy and with their combination, but always with poor results. The inclusion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment enabled more favorable treatment results. The mortality from disseminated disease is the main problem in these patients, inducing the question of need for additional postoperative adjuvant systemic therapy. For steroid receptor positive patients hormonotherapy is a convenient choice of maintaining treatment. In endocrine non-responsive tumors, the role of postoperative chemotherapy is doubtful, having in mind preoperative chemotherapy and <b>cumulative</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>effects.</b> New trials including {{the large number of}} patients are necessary to obtain the definite answer whether the maintaining chemotherapy is useful but today it seems that additive postoperative treatment is not more efficient than preoperative alone...|$|R

In recent times many neurological problems among children are being addressed in endemic areas. Thereby reasons for the neurotoxicity have to be explicated thoroughly. In this study premated Wistar albino rats were exposed to 50 and 150 ppm fluoride in drinking water during gestation and pups born to them were used to analyze the extent of neurotoxicity imposed in discrete brain areas. Dose dependent toxicity was evident in different brain regions and fluoride exposure has significantly enhanced the levels of malondialdehyde (P> 0. 05), glutathione (P> 0. 05) and decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase (P> 0. 05), catalase (P> 0. 05), glutathione peroxidase (P> 0. 05) and glutathione- S-transferase (P> 0. 05). Alterations were region specific and oral supplementation of dietary antioxidants viz., vitamin-C (20 mg), vitamin-E (400. g), zinc (200. g) and selenium (40. g) not only inhibited oxidative stress but also enhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Metabolic {{syndrome}} (MetS) is {{a constellation}} of symptoms used as a measure to identify patients {{at increased risk for}} cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality. The results of prolonged life expectancy and <b>cumulative</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> of antiretroviral therapy increase the chance that HIV can cause clinical abnormalities, including MetS. METHODS: We evaluated 89 people living with HIV (PLWH; mean age 48 [*]±[*] 7 years; mean duration of HIV infection 17 [*]±[*] 12 years; 47 % men; 66 % African-American, 22 % Hispanic, and 10 % non-Hispanic white; and 84 % unemployed) enrolled in a community-based exercise training and nutrition education program targeting individuals of low socio-economic status (SES). The prevalence of MetS characteristics and the factors associated with the presence of MetS were analyzed. RESULTS: One in three (33 %; 12 men and 17 women) PLWH met ATPIII criteria for MetS. In our cohort, MetS was driven by high waist circumference and elevated blood pressure. In addition, higher use of protease inhibitors, elevated hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c), greater self-reported daily caloric intake and consumption of carbohydrates, sugar, added sugar, and higher glycemic load were found among the individuals with MetS, compared to those without it. Elevated HbA 1 c and high total sugar consumption were the strongest predictors and accounted for 30 % of the occurrence of MetS. CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of MetS in our PLWH cohort receiving antiretroviral therapy is higher than previously reported in the general population and in other PLWH cohorts. Additional work is needed to determine whether MetS is a more disease dependent or lifestyle dependent condition in PLWH...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cisplatin is {{primarily}} used {{for treatment of}} ovarian and testicular cancer. Oxaliplatin is the only effective treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. Both are known to cause dose related, <b>cumulative</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> on the peripheral nervous system and thirty to forty percent of cancer patients receiving these agents experience painful peripheral neuropathy. The mechanisms underlying painful platinum-induced neuropathy remain poorly understood. Previous studies have demonstrated important roles for TRPV 1, TRPM 8, and TRPA 1 in inflammation and nerve injury induced pain. Results In this study, using real-time, reverse transcriptase, polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we analyzed the expression of TRPV 1, TRPM 8, and TRPA 1 induced by cisplatin or oxaliplatin in vitro and in vivo. For in vitro studies, cultured E 15 rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were treated for up to 48 hours with cisplatin or oxaliplatin. For in vivo studies, trigeminal ganglia (TG) were isolated from mice treated with platinum drugs for three weeks. We show that cisplatin and oxaliplatin-treated DRG neurons had significantly increased in TRPV 1, TRPA 1, and TRPM 8 mRNA expression. TG neurons from cisplatin treated mice had significant increases in TRPV 1 and TRPA 1 mRNA expression while oxaliplatin strongly induced only TRPA 1. Furthermore, compared to the cisplatin-treated wild-type mice, cisplatin-treated TRPV 1 -null mice developed mechanical allodynia but did not exhibit enhancement of noxious heat- evoked pain responses. Immunohistochemistry studies showed that cisplatin-treated mice had {{no change in the}} proportion of the TRPV 1 immunopositive TG neurons. Conclusion These results indicate that TRPV 1 and TRPA 1 could {{contribute to the development of}} thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia following cisplatin-induced painful neuropathy but that TRPV 1 has a crucial role in cisplatin-induced thermal hyperalgesia in vivo. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{polyethers}} yessotoxin (YTX) and {{okadaic acid}} (OA) are two marine algal toxins frequently associated as edible shellfish contaminants.

The study was carried out on male albino Wistar rats (n= 30, age= 35 - 37 days, body mass 120 g +/- 10 g). The animals were raised in controlled laboratory conditions and provided with standard laboratory rat food and tap water ad libitum. The rats were divided into two groups: ten animals composed the control group and did not undergo any treatment. The 20 experimental rats were exposed to 10 mg of CdCl 2 /L drinking water for 90 days. After 90 days, all animals were victimized and after the macroscopic inspection of the heart, myocardial tissue was routinely processed and embedded in paraffin. Sections 5 micrometers thick were stained by HE method and histochemical PAS-AB (pH 2, 5), Masson trichrome method for demonstrating collagen fibers and Toluidine blue for mast cells identification. Cross-striated banding pattern of cardiac cells was ruined. Noticeable atrophy and hydropic degeneration of subendocardial localized cardiac cells were found, with the focal presence of myocytolysis. Endothelial cell hyperplasia and edema of the intima were present on arteriolar type blood vessels causing the focal subocclusion. Fibrocytes, histiocytes and mast cells were numerous, perivascularly localized. Mast cells were polymorphic, larger than normal, oval and mostly degranulated. Instead of scanty endomysium, there is a noticeable interstitial fibrillar fibrosis with few fields of collagen in all myocardium layers between cardiac cells, which is particularly prominent around the larger blood vessels.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Maintenance therapy {{improves}} {{outcomes in}} various tumour types, but <b>cumulative</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> limit {{the choice of}} drugs. We investigated whether maintenance therapy with vinflunine would delay disease progression in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma who had achieved disease control with first-line chemotherapy. METHODS: We did a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2 trial in 21 Spanish hospitals. Eligible patients had locally advanced, surgically unresectable, or metastatic transitional-cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract, adequate organ function, and disease control after four to six cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine (carboplatin allowed after cycle four). Patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive vinflunine or best supportive care until disease progression. We initially used block randomisation with a block size of six. Four lists were created for the two stratification factors of starting dose of vinflunine and presence of liver metastases. After a protocol amendment, number of cisplatin and gemcitabine cycles was added as a stratification factor, and eight lists were created, still with a block size of six. Finally, we changed to a minimisation procedure {{to reduce the risk}} of imbalance between groups. Vinflunine was given every 21 days as a 20 min intravenous infusion at 320 mg/m 2 or at 280 mg/m 2 in patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 1, age 75 years or older, previous pelvic radiotherapy, or creatinine clearance lower than 60 mL/min. The primary endpoint was median progression-free survival longer than 5 · 3 months in the vinflunine group, assessed by modified intention to treat. Comparison of progression-free survival between treatment groups was a secondary endpoint. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01529411. FINDINGS: Between April 12, 2012, and Jan 29, 2015, we enrolled 88 patients, of whom 45 were assigned to receive vinflunine and 43 to receive best supportive care. One patient from the vinflunine group was lost to follow-up immediately after randomisation and was excluded from the analyses. One patient in the best supportive care group became ineligible for the study and did not receive treatment due to a delay in enrolment, but was included in the intention-to-treat efficacy analysis. After a median follow-up of 15 · 6 months (IQR 8 · 5 - 26 · 0), 29 (66 %) of 44 patients in the vinflunine group had disease progression and 24 (55 %) had died, compared with 36 (84 %) of 43 patients with disease progression and 32 (74 %) deaths in the best supportive care group. Median progression-free survival was 6 · 5 months (95 % CI 2 · 0 - 11 · 1) in the vinflunine group and 4 · 2 months (2 · 1 - 6 · 3) in the best supportive care group (hazard ratio 0 · 59, 95 % CI 0 · 37 - 0 · 96, p= 0 · 031). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (eight [18 %] of 44 in the vinflunine group vs none of 42 in the best supportive care group), asthenia or fatigue (seven [16 %] vs one [2 %]), and constipation (six [14 %] vs none). 18 serious adverse events were reported in the vinflunine group and 14 in the best supportive care group. One patient in the vinflunine group died from pneumonia that was deemed to be treatment related. INTERPRETATION: In patients with disease control after first-line chemotherapy, progression-free survival exceeded the acceptable threshold with vinflunine maintenance therapy. Moreover, progression-free survival was longer with vinflunine maintenance therapy than with best supportive care. Vinflunine maintenance had an acceptable safety profile.

40|$|BACKGROUND Imatinib, a {{selective}} BCR-ABL 1 kinase inhibitor, improved the prognosis {{for patients with}} chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We conducted efficacy and safety analyses {{on the basis of}} more than 10 years of follow-up in patients with CML who were treated with imatinib as initial therapy. METHODS In this open-label, multicenter trial with crossover design, we randomly assigned patients with newly diagnosed CML in the chronic phase to receive either imatinib or interferon alfa plus cytarabine. Long-term analyses included overall survival, response to treatment, and serious adverse events. RESULTS The median follow-up was 10. 9 years. Given the high rate of crossover among patients who had been randomly assigned to receive interferon alfa plus cytarabine (65. 6 %) and the short duration of therapy before crossover in these patients (median, 0. 8 years), the current analyses focused on patients who had been randomly assigned to receive imatinib. Among the patients in the imatinib group, the estimated overall survival rate at 10 years was 83. 3 %. Approximately half the patients (48. 3 %) who had been randomly assigned to imatinib completed study treatment with imatinib, and 82. 8 % had a complete cytogenetic response.

40|$|Although {{there are}} high {{survival}} rates {{for children with}} acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, their outcome is often counterbalanced by the burden of <b>toxic</b> <b>effects.</b> This is because reported frequencies vary widely across studies, partly because of diverse definitions of <b>toxic</b> <b>effects.</b> Using the Delphi method, 15 international childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia study groups assessed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia protocols to address <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> that were to be considered by the Ponte di Legno working group. 14 acute <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> (hypersensitivity to asparaginase, hyperlipidaemia, osteonecrosis, asparaginase-associated pancreatitis, arterial hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, seizures, depressed level of consciousness, methotrexate-related stroke-like syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, high-dose methotrexate-related nephrotoxicity, sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, thromboembolism, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) that are serious but too rare to be addressed comprehensively within any single group, or are deemed to need consensus definitions for reliable incidence comparisons, were selected for assessment. Our results showed {{that none of the}} protocols addressed all 14 <b>toxic</b> <b>effects,</b> that no two protocols shared identical definitions of all <b>toxic</b> <b>effects,</b> and that no <b>toxic</b> <b>effect</b> definition was shared by all protocols. Using the Delphi method over three face-to-face plenary meetings, consensus definitions were obtained for all 14 <b>toxic</b> <b>effects.</b> In the overall assessment of outcome of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment, these expert opinion-based definitions will allow reliable comparisons of frequencies and severities of acute <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> across treatment protocols, and facilitate international research on cause, guidelines for treatment adaptation, preventive strategies, and development of consensus algorithms for reporting on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment.

50|$|A {{large number}} of studies have been {{conducted}} to assess the potential toxicity of YTXs. To date none of these studies has highlighted any <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> of YTXs when they are present in humans. They have, however, found YTXs to have <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> in mice when the YTX had been administered by an intraperitoneal injection into the animal. The toxicicological effects encountered are similar to those seen for paralytic shellfish toxins, and include hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and neurotoxicity, with a YTX level of 100 µg/kg causing <b>toxic</b> <b>effects.</b> Limited <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> have been seen after oral administration of the toxin to animals.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Imatinib, a {{selective}} BCR-ABL 1 kinase inhibitor, improved the prognosis {{for patients with}} chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We conducted efficacy and safety analyses {{on the basis of}} more than 10 years of follow-up in patients with CML who were treated with imatinib as initial therapy. METHODS: In this open-label, multicenter trial with crossover design, we randomly assigned patients with newly diagnosed CML in the chronic phase to receive either imatinib or interferon alfa plus cytarabine. Long-term analyses included overall survival, response to treatment, and serious adverse events. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 10. 9 years. Given the high rate of crossover among patients who had been randomly assigned to receive interferon alfa plus cytarabine (65. 6 %) and the short duration of therapy before crossover in these patients (median, 0. 8 years), the current analyses focused on patients who had been randomly assigned to receive imatinib. Among the patients in the imatinib group, the estimated overall survival rate at 10 years was 83. 3 %. Approximately half the patients (48. 3 %) who had been randomly assigned to imatinib completed study treatment with imatinib, and 82. 8 % had a complete cytogenetic response. Serious adverse events that were considered by the investigators to be related to imatinib were uncommon and most frequently occurred {{during the first year of}} treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 11 years of follow-up showed that the efficacy of imatinib persisted over time and that long-term administration of imatinib was not associated with unacceptable <b>cumulative</b> or late <b>toxic</b> <b>effects.</b> (Funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals; IRIS ClinicalTrials. gov numbers, NCT 00006343 and NCT 00333840.)
