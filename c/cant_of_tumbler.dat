40|$|Abstract. A multi-faceted {{introduction}} {{on current}} state and development trends <b>of</b> <b>tumbler</b> screening technology was proposed, which included that {{the origin and}} development <b>of</b> the <b>tumbler</b> screening machines, a comparison between tumbler screening machines and rotary vibration screens, the structure design and analysis, especially the screen mesh cleaning technology and specific machine applications. The status and development trends <b>of</b> <b>tumbler</b> screening machines in China and abroad especially in German were analyzed. The developing direction <b>of</b> future <b>tumbler</b> screening machines and the situation of Chinese businesses producing tumbler screening machines development were introduced. The Origin and Development Tumbler screening is a special form of screening machine among many other structures, and it is named after the rocking motion of its circular screen. Tumbler screening machines adopt mechanical eccentricity and offset angle forced driving mode. The entire cylindrical screen box makes rocking motion driven by the rocking shaft, and thus the machine belongs to mechanical rocking motion screens. The basic structure <b>of</b> the <b>tumbler</b> screening machines is developed in 1999 [1], the German inventor G. Kainz was granted the patent in Europe. Then, several technica...|$|R
30|$|We {{compared}} preoperative {{and postoperative}} results by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The correlations among preoperative and postoperative <b>canting</b> <b>of</b> the canines, <b>canting</b> <b>of</b> the molars, {{slope of the}} canines, slope <b>of</b> the molars, <b>canting</b> <b>of</b> the lips at rest, and slope of the lips at rest were examined by regression analyses. Similarly, the correlations among preoperative and postoperative <b>canting</b> <b>of</b> the canines, <b>canting</b> <b>of</b> the molars, slope of the canines, slope of the molars, and canting and slope angle of the lips while smiling were analyzed by regression analyses. The statistical significances of the results were verified using the IBM SPSS statistics 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) program. The level of significance was set at 0.05.|$|R

The magnitude of the postoperative lip line improvement while smiling was not significantly correlated with changes in the <b>canting</b> and slopes <b>of</b> the canines, molars, and lip lines at rest.|$|R

50|$|This is the {{separation}} of material which the fine particles fall through the screen and the oversize particles contain on the above screen, unfortunately {{a certain percentage of}} fine particles usually remain on the above screen after the oscillation. Moreover, without good maintenance, long-term using may cause wearing of screen surface which lead to oversize particles fall through screen.The efficiency <b>of</b> <b>tumbler</b> screening machine η can be express as: η = Mp÷MF, where Mp is the mass of fine particles which pass through the screen surface during the operation <b>of</b> <b>tumbler</b> screening machine, and MF is the mass of fine particles which in the initial feed of material to the tumbler screening machine.|$|R
