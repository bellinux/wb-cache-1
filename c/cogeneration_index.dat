50|$|The {{so-called}} COGIX (<b>COGeneration</b> <b>IndeX)</b> is {{an indicator}} for the operating efficiency of CHP-plants, that receive revenues at the wholesale electricity market. It {{is similar to}} the spark spread / green spark spread including emission costs for greenhouse gases, which is a contribution margin calculated from fuel costs, emission costs and revenues from electricity sales. In the COGIX framework, also the revenues from heat sales of the CHP-plant are considered.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, multivariant {{simulation}} calculations {{are performed}} {{for the following}} natural-gas fired combined heat-and-power plants with gas turbines: (1) a gas-steam combined heat-and-power plant with an extraction-condensing steam turbine, and (2) a gas-steam combined heat-and-power plant with a back-pressure steam-turbine. For these systems, mathematical models of the behaviours of their basic elements, such as: the block of the gas turbine (compressor, combustion chamber and gas turbine), heat-recovery steam generator and steam-turbine cycle were developed. On the basis of elaborate mathematical models, a computer program performed multivariant simulation calculations. For each variant, the following factors were calculated for particular types of combined heat-and-power plants: energy efficiency, efficiency of electric-energy generation, <b>cogeneration</b> <b>index</b> and cogeneration factor.
