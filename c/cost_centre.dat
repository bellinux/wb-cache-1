[...] The [...] "base" [...] location (including all stations and ticket-issuing locations) has 00 after the first four digits; other two-digit combinations signify other types of asset, with the first four digits indicating the [...] "base" [...] location to which they relate.

2500|$|Third, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 section 188 {{requires}} employers, who are [...] "contemplating" [...] redundancies of 20 employees, in an [...] "establishment" [...] over 90 days, {{to consult}} for 30 {{days with the}} workforce. [...] "Redundancy" [...] is an economic dismissal [...] "not related to the individual concerned" [...] (e.g. for poor work or misconduct). In University of Stirling v UCU the Supreme Court held that expiry of fixed term contracts, for 140 University teaching staff, did not count as a reason [...] "related to the individual", and so staff should have been consulted. An [...] "establishment" [...] includes [...] "a distinct entity that is ordinarily permanent, entrusted with performing specified tasks, namely primarily the sale of goods, and which has, to that end, several workers, technical means and an organisational structure in that the store is an individual <b>cost</b> <b>centre</b> managed by a manager." [...] In Lyttle v Bluebird UK Bidco 2 Ltd, the Court of Justice held this meant that Woolworths shops in Northern Ireland, each with under 20 employees, could claim to be separate establishments. More doubtfully, it was held by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in E Green & Sons (Castings) Ltd v ASTMS that three companies, all operating from the same premises, were different establishments {{even though they were}} part of the same group. There is considerable disagreement over when an employing entity must begin consulting: the Directive says when decision-makers are [...] "contemplating", while the Regulations say [...] "proposes". In AEK ry v Fujitsu Siemens Computers Oy the Court of Justice held consulting must begin [...] "once a strategic or commercial decision compelling him to contemplate or to plan for collective redundancies has been taken." [...] In groups of companies, where a parent controls the subsidiary, the duty to perform the consulting process falls on the subsidiary, but the duty begins as soon as the parent has contemplated that a particular subsidiary [...] "has been identified" [...] for redundancies for consulting [...] "to have any meaning". Consultation should take place with the recognised trade union first, but if there is none, then elected employee representatives, if necessary giving enough time to organise an election. Section 188(7) says that an employer has a [...] "defence" [...] for not consulting if there are [...] "exceptional circumstances", but this [...] "exception" [...] is not in the Directive, and courts have avoided applying it. Dismissals cannot take effect until meaningful negotiation has taken place. If employers fail to negotiate, they must pay a [...] "protective award" [...] of up to 90 days' pay to each employee. Essentially similar rules apply for consultation with staff before any transfer of an undertaking.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, factory {{management}} was faced with the problem how overhead cost should be assigned to products. According to Levant & Zimnovitch [...] "other problems also appeared at this time in the modelling of costing systems, such as how to distinguishbetween “production” <b>cost</b> <b>centres</b> working directly for production and “service provider” <b>cost</b> <b>centres</b> working for other centres, making it necessary to cascade the distribution of the charges related to these <b>cost</b> <b>centres.</b> Garner (1954) refers to Nicholson (1913) as well as to Webner (1917) and Taylor for how this problem was tackled." ...|$|R
5000|$|Makes {{the manager}} more {{efficient}} - Managers compare cost data from different time periods {{in order to}} see whether the <b>cost</b> <b>centre</b> is becoming more or less profitable. Generally a specific person (a <b>cost</b> <b>centre</b> manager) is held accountable for costs incurring in the <b>cost</b> <b>centre</b> under his or her control, in which case, collecting and comparing costs may motivate the manager to be more productive.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cost</b> <b>centre</b> adds to a firm's cost {{whereas a}} profit centre {{adds to the}} firm's cost and profit. Furthermore, the main {{objective}} of a <b>cost</b> <b>centre</b> is to minimise cost whereas the main objective of a profit centre is to maximise profit. Profit centres provide a wider and more general measurement of performance than the <b>cost</b> <b>centre.</b> In <b>cost</b> <b>centre,</b> the manager is only responsible for the cost whereas in a profit centre, the manager is responsible for cost and profit. In situations like this when manager is responsible for both, profit and cost, the contribution of each manager {{to the goal of}} the firm becomes easier to measure.|$|E
5000|$|Efficiency and {{productivity}} cannot be assessed properly - in a <b>cost</b> <b>centre,</b> {{the result of}} a decision is calculated by cost alone; the achievements of the <b>cost</b> <b>centre</b> are not measured in financial terms, therefore it is hard to assess efficiency {{and productivity}} properly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide a description and analysis of the main costing and pricing (reimbursement) systems employed by hospitals in the Spanish National Health System (NHS). Hospitals cost calculations are mostly based on a full costing approach as opposite to other systems like direct costing or activity based costing.

5000|$|A <b>cost</b> <b>centre</b> is a {{department}} within a business to which costs can be allocated. The term includes departments {{which does not}} produce directly but incurs costs to the business, when the manager and employees of the <b>cost</b> <b>centre</b> are not accountable for the profitability and investment decisions of the business but {{they are responsible for}} some of its costs.|$|E

50|$|The main {{function}} of a <b>cost</b> <b>centre</b> is the tracing of all expenses linked with a certain function. For example, by considering a call centre as an independent unit, the firm can calculate how much it is spending each year for its 1-800 support service. If a <b>cost</b> <b>centre</b> is not considered independent then {{it would take a}} lot of effort in measuring the cost of providing this service because it will include dividing up the company's entire personnel and phone bills by department each month.|$|E
5000|$|Nicholson most {{important}} contributions to cost accounting consisted of [...] "emphasizing <b>cost</b> <b>centres</b> and the measuring of profits for individual departments based on machine hour rates."

For example, if an HR department was removed then basic employment functions and essential business processes cannot be performed which will affect the firm's profit negatively.|$|R

30|$|In {{connection}} to this, Carlin (2005) sets out {{the superiority of}} accrual accounting over the cash-based system, basing his perspective on three points: first of all, an accrual accounting system leads to greater transparency and improved quality of information, resulting in a more accurate allocation of company resources; it works {{on the performance of}} each individual and the group in general and, by identifying <b>cost</b> <b>centres,</b> organisational efficiency also increases.|$|R
40|$|The {{significance}} of indirect {{costs in the}} cost price calculation of clinical chemistry laboratory tests {{by way of the}} production centres method has been investigated. A cost structure model based on the ‘production centres’ method, the Academisch Ziekenhuis Groningen (AZG) 1 - 2 - 3 model, is used for the calculation of cost and cost prices as an add-in tool to the spreadsheet program Lotus 1 - 2 - 3. The system specifications of the AZG 1 - 2 - 3 cost structure model have been extended with facilities to impute all relevant indirect <b>costs</b> to <b>cost</b> <b>centres</b> by aid of allocation rules, which can be chosen freely. The inference is made that as indirect costs play a more important part in decision-making processes concerning planning and control, the specification of the relation to the <b>cost</b> <b>centres</b> should be determined in a more detailed way. The AZG 1 - 2 - 3 cost structure model has therefore been extended in order to increase the significance as a management tool for laboratory management...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} an {{adequate}} information system for the Highways Departments in the United Kingdom has been recognised by the report of a committee presented to the Minister of Transport in 1970, (The Marshall Report). This research aims to present a comprehensive information system on a sound theoretical basis which should enable the different levels of management to execute their work adequately. The suggested system presented in this research covers the different functions of the Highways Department, and presents a suggested solution for problems which may occur during the planning and controlling {{of work in the}} different locations of the Highways Department. The information system consists of:- 1. A coding system covering the <b>cost</b> units, <b>cost</b> <b>centres</b> and <b>cost</b> elements. 2. Cost accounting records for the cost units and <b>cost</b> <b>centres.</b> 3. A budgeting and budgetary control system covering, the different planning methods and procedures which are required for preparing the capital expenditure budget, the improvement and maintenance operation flexible budgets and programme of work, the plant budget, the administration budget, and the purchasing budget. 4. A reporting system which ensures that the different levels of management are receiving relevant and timely information. 5. The flow of documents which covers the relationship between the prime documents, the cost accounting records, budgets, reports and their relation to the different sections and offices within the department. A comprehensive <b>cost</b> units, <b>cost</b> <b>centres,</b> and <b>cost</b> elements codes together with a number of examples demonstrating the results of the survey, and examples of the application and procedures of the suggested information system have been illustrated separately as appendices.
