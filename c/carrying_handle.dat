25|$|<b>Carrying</b> <b>handle</b> {{replaced}} with a Picatinny rail for scope mounting as a designated marksman rifle. Said {{to be for the}} use of Indonesian special forces. The front sight has been removed and the barrel lengthened and accurized to improve accuracy.|$|E
25|$|A new rifle {{based on}} the SS1, being {{replaced}} in the Indonesian military after tests had been conducted from 2003–2005. It has been adopted by Indonesian security forces in 2006. It has a <b>carrying</b> <b>handle</b> that can be replaced with a scope for scope mounting on a Picatinny rail and a side-folding stock. It is the only rifle variant that the Pindad SPG-1A underbarrel grenade launcher can be used.|$|E
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} between the TMA-5 and the TMA-5A is that the TMA-5 uses a rope <b>carry</b> <b>handle,</b> and the TMA-5A uses a webbing <b>carry</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|R

25|$|Guitar {{amplifiers}} {{vary widely}} in price and quality. Many music equipment companies import small, low-powered practice amplifiers {{for students and}} beginners that sell for less than $50 USD. Other companies produce expensive custom-made amplifiers for professional musicians, which can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars (USD). Most combo amplifiers have a <b>carrying</b> <b>handle,</b> and many combo amplifiers and cabinets have metal or plastic-reinforced corners to protect the amp during transportation.|$|E
25|$|Mitrailleur M. 20. In the Netherlands, the Lewis in both {{ground and}} {{aircraft}} versions {{was used in}} 6.5×53 mm R caliber, using a 97-round magazine only. The infantry version was equipped with a <b>carrying</b> <b>handle</b> on a clamp around {{the rear of the}} cooling tube. After the German invasion of May 1940, the weapon was also used by Germany under the designation 6,5 mm leichtes Maschinengewehr 100 (h).|$|E
25|$|The ARM {{light machine}} gun variant is {{additionally}} equipped with a <b>carrying</b> <b>handle,</b> folding bipod and a larger wooden handguard. The wooden handguard remains cooler during sustained automatic fire and has grooves for bipod storage. When folded, the bipod's legs form a speed chute for rapid magazine insertion; the bipod will form a wire cutter and the rear handguard ferrule, which retains the bipod legs, {{can be used to}} open bottles by design, in order to prevent soldiers using magazine lips for this purpose which damaged them.|$|E
50|$|Enhanced {{variants}} {{with reduced}} <b>carrying</b> <b>handles</b> (flat-tops) {{have been built}} in both Canada and China.|$|R
50|$|Colt and Diemaco further {{improved}} on the design, {{adding a}} flat top <b>carry</b> <b>handle</b> and a further improved bipod to the {{weapon in the}} 1990s. Colt refers {{to it as the}} Model 950, but markets it as the Colt Automatic Rifle, and until their purchase by Colt, as the Diemaco LSW. Because of the Colt-Diemaco partnership on this system, it was the only weapon in their product line to feature A2 rear sights, and when modified a detachable <b>carry</b> <b>handle</b> with A2 rear sights (the majority of Diemaco's product line had A1 rear sights, and they actually developed a detachable <b>carry</b> <b>handle</b> with A1 rear sights). A maple leaf is stamped on the lower receiver of current Colt Automatic Rifles.|$|R
50|$|There is also {{a variant}} with quad-rail handguards and {{telescopic}} CAA CBS-style buttstock and sometimes with extended quad-rail and cut <b>carry</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|R
25|$|The SS2 is {{an upgrade}} of the Pindad SS1, being a {{licensed}} {{version of the}} FN FNC. The SS2's flash suppressor is based on that of the Colt M16A2, {{and it has a}} reciprocating charging handle {{that can be used for}} forward assist, with the front sight being based on the AK rifles. The <b>carrying</b> <b>handle</b> and detachable rear sight is placed on top of Picatinny railings. Most of the SS2 rifle variants can have its carry handle removed in order to gain access to its picatinny railings to install various optics.|$|E
25|$|The export {{versions}} have {{a single}} telescopic sight with a 1.5× magnification and an aiming reticle fixed at 300 m. All rifles are adapted to use the Hensoldt NSA 80 third-generation night sight, which clamps into the G36 carry handle adapter {{in front of the}} optical sight housing and mates with the rifle's standard optical sight. The sighting bridge also functions as a <b>carrying</b> <b>handle</b> and features auxiliary open sights molded on top of the handle that consist of a forward blade and rear notch, but these can only be used with the reflex sight removed, as in the G36V. The optical sight system is produced by Hensoldt AG (a subsidiary of Carl Zeiss AG).|$|E
2500|$|The AR-15's most {{distinctive}} ergonomic {{feature is the}} <b>carrying</b> <b>handle</b> and rear sight assembly {{on top of the}} receiver. This is a by-product of the original ArmaLite design, where the carry handle served to protect the charging handle. As the line of sight is [...] over the bore, the AR-15 has an inherent parallax problem. At closer ranges (typically inside 15–20 meters), the shooter must compensate by aiming high to place shots where desired. The standard AR-15 rifle has a 500mm (19.75inches) sight radius. The AR-15 uses an L-type flip, aperture rear sight and it is adjustable with two settings, 0 to 300 meters and 300 to 400 meters. The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation. The rear sight can be adjusted for windage. The sights can be adjusted with a bullet tip or pointed tool. The AR-15 can also mount a scope on the <b>carrying</b> <b>handle.</b> With the advent of the AR-15A2, a new fully adjustable rear sight was added, allowing the rear sight to be dialed in for specific range settings between 300 and 800 meters and to allow windage adjustments without the need of a tool or cartridge. Current versions such as AR-15A4 use Picatinny rails, which allows the use of various scopes and sighting devices.|$|E

2500|$|The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, {{semi-automatic}} shotgun {{that resembles}} the M16 rifle and mimics the layout and placement {{of some of}} the controls. It was created by Turkish company Akdal Arms. [...] The MKA 1919 uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be quickly removed from upper receiver. To charge the rifle, the charging handle on the receiver must be pulled. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic rifle has a 5-round detachable box magazine. It has a bolt release identical in location and [...] function to the one on the M16. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style being located {{on the left side of}} the receiver above the pistol grip. Standard sights include a front post installed on the M16-style removable base and a detachable M16A2-style <b>carrying</b> <b>handle</b> with built-in diopter sight. On the upper receiver, an integral Picatinny rail exists which will accept detachable <b>carrying</b> <b>handle</b> or optional red-dot or other optical sight attachments.|$|E
2500|$|After {{modifications}} (most notably, {{the charging}} handle was re-located {{from under the}} <b>carrying</b> <b>handle</b> like AR-10 {{to the rear of}} the receiver), the new redesigned rifle was subsequently adopted as the M16 Rifle. [...] "(The M16) was much lighter compared to the M14 it replaced, ultimately allowing Soldiers to carry more ammunition. The air-cooled, gas-operated, magazine-fed assault rifle was made of steel, aluminum alloy and composite plastics, truly cutting-edge for the time. Designed with full and semi-automatic capabilities, the weapon initially did not respond well to wet and dirty conditions, sometimes even jamming in combat. After a few minor modifications, the weapon gained in popularity among troops on the battlefield." ...|$|E
2500|$|G36C (C="Compact", {{commonly}} {{mistaken for}} [...] "Commando", a term trademarked by Colt Firearms for the CAR-15): This subcarbine {{model is a}} further development of the G36K. It has a shorter barrel than the G36K, and a four-prong open-type flash hider or a birdcage type flash hider. The extremely short barrel forced designers to move the gas block closer to the muzzle end and reduce {{the length of the}} gas piston operating rod. The handguard and stock were also shortened and the fixed carry handle (with optics) was replaced with a <b>carrying</b> <b>handle</b> with an integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail. The dual optical sight found on the standard G36 and G36K models was replaced with a set of rail-mounted detachable iron sights that consist of a semi-shrouded front post and a flip-up rear sight with two apertures of different diameter. The short handguard has four accessory attachment points, one of which could be used for a vertical grip. The G36C was developed and produced in January 2001.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid 90s, the SAF {{decided to}} develop an {{indigenous}} rifle to replace the aging M16S1, most {{of which had been}} in service since the 70s. The other option was to procure new—and more expensive—weapons, with the chief contender being the M16A2. The Advanced Combat Rifle was conceived, and it eventually became the SAR 21. The SAR 21 is the first production assault rifle of its class to incorporate a built-in Laser Aiming Device (LAD) (powered by a single [...] "AA" [...] battery) as standard. The rifle incorporates various patented safety features, such as a Kevlar cheek plate and overpressure vent that protects the shooter in the unlikely event of a chamber explosion or catastrophic failure. It also has an integral 1.5× optical scope that is built into its <b>carrying</b> <b>handle.</b> The scope aids in target acquisition, particularly under low light conditions. The scope is factory-zeroed, and requires minimal further zeroing to suit different users. This minimizes non-training range time to zero the weapons and maximises live-firing training hours.|$|E
2500|$|In 1928, the Stromberg-Voisinet {{firm was}} the first company to sell an {{electric}} stringed instrument and amplifier package. However, musicians found that the amps had an [...] "unsatisfactory tone and volume, [...] dependability problems", so the product did not sell well. Even though the Stromberg-Voisinet amp did not sell well, it still launched a new idea: a portable electric instrument amp with a speaker, all in an easily transported wooden cabinet. In 1929, Vega electrics launched a portable banjo amplifier. In 1932, Electro String Instruments and amplifier (this {{is not the same}} company as Stromberg Electro Instruments) introduced a guitar amp with [...] "high output" [...] and a [...] "string driven magnetic pickup". Electro set out the standard template for combo amps: a wooden cabinet with the electronic amplifier mounted inside, and a convenient <b>carrying</b> <b>handle</b> to facilitate transporting the cabinet. 1n 1933, Vivi-Tone amp set-ups were used for live performances and radio shows. In 1934, Rickenbacker launched a similar combo amp that added metal corner protectors to keep the corners in good condition during transportation.|$|E
2500|$|The 50MG was {{developed}} in the 1980s by CIS to replace the obsolete [...] Browning M2HB machine guns used by the SAF. The CIS engineers learnt from the lesson of the unsuccessful American [...] "Dover Devil GPHMG" [...] programme, to create a modular weapon suited for modern tactical doctrines and production techniques. They succeeded and in 1988, CIS introduced the new machine gun and simply named it as the [...] "CIS 50MG". The SAF used the 50MG in its infantry regiments and as a mounted weapon on armoured vehicles and naval craft. The CIS 50MG is a gas-operated, air-cooled, belt-fed weapon. It has a quick-detachable barrel equipped with a <b>carrying</b> <b>handle.</b> The gun is operated using dual gas pistons, located in two gas tubes placed {{on either side of the}} barrel. The barrel is locked by means of a rotary bolt with multiple radial lugs that engages the barrel extension, eliminating the need for headspace adjustments. The CIS 50MG utilizes the same [...] "constant recoil" [...] system used in the Ultimax 100. A unique feature of the 50MG is its dual belt-feed system that allows for fast and easy switching of ammunition from standard ball to armor-piercing Saboted Light Armor Penetrator (SLAP). Such systems are more commonly used in modern automatic cannons.|$|E
