Non-invasive time resolved quenching of Palladium-porphyrin phosphorescence injected into experimental animals has given much fundamental insight in mechanisms of oxygen transport to tissue {{in health and}} models of disease. Until now, most of the phosphorimeters used flash lamps as a light excitation source. However, a major drawback of flash lamps is the plasma glow that persists for tens of microseconds after the primary discharge. When a flash lamp produces a pulse, a tail remains causing unwanted further excitation to the initial pulse of the phosphor in a time dependent manner. This generates a <b>complex</b> <b>excitation</b> pulse pattern, which if not taken into account using deconvolution analysis, can lead to inaccurate PO 2 readings.|$|E
