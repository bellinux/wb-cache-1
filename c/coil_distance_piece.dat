The sensor is simple, low-cost, and applicable for machine shafts speed measurements (spatially available and unavailable). On the shaft, whose rotational speed is measured, the rotational per-manent magnet is fixed. From measured frequency value of induced voltage in the coil sensor the rotational speed value is given using PC with adequate software, interface for the analogue signal conditioning and AD converter. The rotational speed depen-dence on the induction <b>coil</b> sensor <b>distance</b> from the rotational permanent magnet has been given. The induced voltage dependence on the <b>coil</b> <b>distance</b> from the magnet has been obtained as well.

40|$|Dynamic {{wireless}} charging (DWC) of electric vehicles (EVs) is an emerging technology {{that could lead}} to the breakthrough of EVs. The technology is based on the inductive coupling between an electrified track deployed under the road surface and a pickup coil fitted in EV. This paper refers to a lumped track made of DD coils and is concerned with the design of the track layout, namely coil dimension in the motion direction and track <b>coil</b> <b>distance</b> for a given energy requirement. This paper starts by comparing the coupling characteristics of DD coils with different dimensions by a finite-element method (FEM) analysis. Afterward, an analytical procedure is developed to establish the track <b>coil</b> <b>distance</b> able to transfer to a moving EV the propulsion energy required per unit of traveled space. The procedure utilizes the DD-coil coupling characteristics to calculate the power and, from it, the energy transferred from the track coils to the pickup coil along the track. Instrumental in the calculation is the definition of a parameter, denoted as track flux coverage, which gives the ratio between the dimension of the track coils in the motion direction and the coil distance; such a parameter corresponds to the percentage of road populated with track coils so that it is a cost index of the DWC system implementation. Effects of a lateral displacement of the EV motion from the line joining the track coil centers are also analyzed. Design findings are checked against the results obtained with a computer-assisted analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report {{was to determine the}} effects of press temperature and pressing time on the density distribution of particleboards throughout the thickness, and to make clear the relation of the density distribution to the strength properties of these boards. Wood particle used in this experiment was splinter type (5 - 16 mesh) of Lauan. The bond used was phenol resin and its solid content was 6 % (OD) for weight of a particle-mat. <b>Distance</b> <b>piece</b> of 15 mm thick was used and press temperature was varied within the range of 130 to 190 °C, and pressing time 10 - 35 min. The density distribution of particleboard was measured by soft x-ray and densitometric method. The results obtained will be summarized as follows: (1) The percentages of thickness recovery of particleboards after hot-pressing decrease rapidly with increasing of pressing time as shown in Fig. 1, and critical pressing time is about 25 min for 130 °C of press temperature and about 15 min for 150 - 190 °C of press temperature. (2) The consolidation progress of each layer within particle-mat and the variation of density distribution of the particleboard through the thickness during hot-pressing are illustrated in Fig. 2 and 3. These figures indicate that the final type of density distribution of particleboards which are hot pressed with <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> at the different press temperature in the range of 130 - 190 °C are not differ from each other. However, the density distribution of the particleboard which is hot-pressed without <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> is differ from them (Fig. 4). (3) The bending strength of particleboards depend primarily on the density of the face (back), and so, the values are scarecely affected by press temperature and pressing time after the layers have been consolidated (Fig. 5).

It is shown to contribute to the short <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> at the same order of magnitude as the box diagram. Typeset using REVTEX 1 The phenomenon of meson mixing has been studied for a long time. Observed in the K 0 − ¯ K 0 and B 0 − ¯ B 0 systems, it provides an extremely sensitive test of the Standard Model (SM) and essential for the CP violation in the neutral meson system. It is well known that because of the GIM cancellation mechanism and large mass of the top quark the short distance box diagram dominates in B 0 − ¯ B 0 system and constitutes a significant fraction of the K 0 − ¯ K 0 mixing amplitude. The case of D 0 − ¯ D 0 system is somewhat special: the b-quark contribution to the fermion loop of the box diagram providing ∆C = 2 transition is diminished by a tiny Vub CKM matrix element. Thus, only the light quark mass difference guarantees that mixing does take place. The effect vanishes in the limit of the SU(3) invariance. All of that results in the estimated value for ∆mD being of the order of 10 − 17 GeV if only short distance contributions are taken into account [1], [2].

A wireless magnetic link, operating at 1 MHz, has been developed. It comprises a dedicated class E power driver, tuned for an inter-coil distance of 100 mm, at the primary side, and a sensor module (⌀ 15 mm x 4 mm), used to measure human activity, at the secondary side. A high data rate RF transceiver, operating in the 2. 4 GHz ISM band, is used for both sensor data transfer and wireless power feedback. The system is able to support a constant energy level at the secondary side for dynamic <b>coil</b> <b>distance</b> variations between 35 and 200 mm.

40|$|Inductive {{powering}} for implanted medical devices, such as implantable biosensors, is a {{safe and}} effective technique that allows power to be delivered to implants wirelessly, avoiding the use of transcutaneous wires or implanted batteries. Wireless powering is very sensitive {{to a number of}} link parameters, including <b>coil</b> <b>distance,</b> alignment, shape, and load conditions. The optimum drive frequency of an inductive link varies depending on the coil spacing and load. This paper presents an optimum frequency tracking (OFT) method, in which an inductive power link is driven at a frequency that is maintained at an optimum value to ensure that the link is working at resonance, and the output voltage is maximised. The method is shown to provide significant improvements in maintained secondary voltage and system efficiency for a range of loads when the link is overcoupled. The OFT method does not require the use of variable capacitors or inductors. When tested at frequencies around a nominal frequency of 5 MHz, the OFT method provides up to a twofold efficiency improvement compared to a fixed frequency drive.

We {{show that}} because of the milder GIM suppression, the four-quark dipenguin {{operator}} contributes to the short <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> of the D 0 − ¯ D 0 mixing amplitude at the same order of magnitude as the box diagram. In addition, we put an upper bound ∆mLDR D ≤ 5 × ∆mbox D on a long-distance resonant contribution induced by the penguin mixing. The phenomenon of meson mixing has been studied for a long time. Observed in the K 0 − ¯ K 0 and B 0 − ¯ B 0 systems, it provides an extremely sensitive test of the Standard Model (SM). Extremely large value of the top quark mass makes the short distance box diagram (e. g. Fig. 1 a) dominate B 0 − ¯ B 0 and K 0 − ¯ K 0 mixing amplitudes. This fact effectively turns GIM cancellation mechanism (vanishing of the total ∆Q = 2 contribution in the limit of equal internal quark masses) into the ”GIM-enhancement ” of the short-distance contribution to ∆mP for P = {K, B}. Long-distance contributions associated with the propagation of the hadronic degrees of freedom and higher-order QCD effects are relatively unimportant for the mixing of B and K mesons. The situation is drastically different {{in the case of the}} D 0 − ¯ D 0 system: the only available heavy b-quark contribution to the box diagram providing ∆C = 2 transition is greatly reduced by a tiny Vub CKM matrix element and can be safely neglected in the analysis of the box diagram contribution to ∆mD (the inclusion of the b-quark further decreases the box diagram contribution [1]). This forces the vanishing of the effect in the SU(3) limit and implies that only the light quark mass difference guarantees that mixing does take place. Calculating a box diagram and constructing the effective Hamiltonian, we realize that the smallness of the short <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> is guaranteed by a factor of (m 2 s − m 2 d) 2 /m 2 c [2] (we define L = (1 + γ 5) / 2) Heff = G 2 F 2 π 2 ξsξd (m 2 s − m 2 d) 2 m 2 [ūγµLcūγµLc + 2 ūRcūRc c (1) ic Viu.
