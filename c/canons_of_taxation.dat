40|$|Abstract: The paper {{which is}} {{theoretical}} has {{set out to}} investigate Tax Reforms and sustainable economic development. Tax is a compulsory levy by the Government on people and organizations within its jurisdiction. Taxation {{is one of the}} most important sources of revenue to government. Adam Smith and David Ricardo are the first people to propound theories of taxation. Adam Smith gave four maxims or <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> as simplicity, certainty, neutrality/fairness and efficiency of collection. These maxims have inspired many other theories thereafter. Thus Tax Reforms have been seen as very important to assist the government achieve its goals including sustainable economic development. The paper calls on government to find ways of dealing with tax evasion and tax avoidance for sustainable development is a pattern of growth that advocates use of resources aimed at meeting human needs of the present and future generations. Sustainable economic development is world wide and broader than traditional economic development which is limited to the third world...|$|E

The underlying principle of the method is in the measurement of highway wear andtear in terms of impact force on the highway. From impact force, slightly modified by highway space occupied and a limited application of the 'ability to pay' <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation,</b> a schedule <b>of</b> relative ratios showing the proportional place that different vehicles should occupy in the scale of contributions is evolved. Using this schedule, actual figures of highway costs are taken to show how the method may be worked out into a compensating system of registration fees and gasoline taxes.

40|$|A {{government}} can finance its activities in four ways. It can tax. It can borrow. It can create money. And it can generate revenue through its operation of enterprises. 1 These days, taxation {{is widely regarded}} as the primary source of state revenue, and this primacy is generally accepted as proper. It is quite common for contemporary authors to cite Adam Smith’s four <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation,</b> which he articulated in 1776 in the Wealth of Nations. These canons held that taxes should be levied in proportion to property, should be certain and not arbitrary, should be convenient to pay, and should be economical to administer for both the taxpayer and the state. Furthermore, Smith thought that taxation ideally should be the sole source of state revenue. He preceded his discussion of tax canons with an argument that the state should abolish its holdings of property, thereby relinquishing any revenue it derives from those holdings. Modern states, of course, have not followed Smith’s advice in this respect, and have proven ready to accept revenue from nearly any source. While Smith’s vision of a state financed predominately by taxation i...|$|E
40|$|In a group structure, {{individual}} companies comprising a {{group are}} effectively managed {{as a single}} 'economic unit'. The economic unit concept refers {{to a group of}} companies that are collectively integrated on a financial, an organisational or an economic basis by virtue of common control, so that they are working towards a common purpose or goal. The South African income tax dispensation currently makes no provision for group taxation. Each legal entity within a group is taxed as a separate taxpayer. This study aims to evaluate whether {{there is a need for}} a system of group taxation in South Africa. In order to do so, the definition of a group was considered, the different tax treatment of divisions as opposed to a group structure were investigated, the current income tax dispensation for inter-group transactions was analysed, and anomalies arising from that were highlighted. The recommendations of the Katz Commission in its Third Interim Report, which addressed the issue of group taxation, were also examined to determine whether the report supports the implementation of a system of group taxation in South Africa. The impact of a system of group taxation for meeting the requirements of the <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation,</b> as well as the implications for the fiscus and the taxpayer, were also examined. The analyses and the conclusions clearly show that the status quo with regard to the inherent tax anomalies arising from the taxation of intra-group transactions is unsustainable, and that a system of group taxation should be implemented in South Africa...|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. VAT is a {{tax that}} is based on taxing the value added on {{successive}} transactions in the supply chain, accordingly it {{is a tax}} designed for the retail or manufacturing industries. South Africa introduced VAT that is similar to that introduced across the world and later refined it. The revisions included the introduction of VAT on banking services. The introduction of VAT to banking is a first in the VAT world but still does not find a cure for the principle dilemma of taxing a bank's value added, under VAT. The study therefore established if banks are treated fairly by investigating: • The three <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation,</b> • The eight principles on which VAT rests, • And the agreement between SARS and the Council of South African Banks. The reason of the above is to propose enhancements or an alternative design that would either increase the accuracy, equity, or simplify the calculation of VAT in the banking sector. The study found that there are several options when introducing VAT to the financial services sector, namely: • zero rate it and the fiscuss looses out on the output VAT, • tax it and increase the cost of borrowing as well as face the problems of determining the value added per transaction or; • exempt it and a practice known as cascading takes place. Neither of these solutions seemed viable although the full taxation option is conceptually the only correct method oftaxation. In most countries the exemption option was taken. The result of exempting interest is that banks have to apportion their input VAT. There are various options open to a bank when calculating the ratio of input VAT to be claimed, yet legislation has only made mention of two. To alleviate this situation the VAT authorities and the Council of South African Banks have agreed upon a methodology to calculate the ratio of input VAT to be reclaimed. This agreement is not compulsory and only applies to areas where the bank does not have an alternative apportionment technique, and in some instances is also flawed in its logic. Consequently banks have the option to apportion input VAT on what they perceive to be a fair basis. The indecision and inequities described above does not result an accurate VAT. The conclusion was that the design is urtiust and the practical calculation, when applied, does not the deliver the correct amount of tax payable. The study introduced a different form of VAT, named the Business Transfer Tax. This tax is an additive form of VAT, based on accounts that relate to interest and trading income. Interest income and trading income would be zero rated under the current VAT, and therefore entitle the bank to claim input tax incurred on expenditure. This would overcome all of the issues not resolved previously...|$|E

40|$|Tax {{avoidance}} is {{an exceedingly}} complex area of law. It {{is also a}} matter generally found {{not far from the}} headlines, or from the concerns of state and policy forums such as the G 8 and the OECD. In an increasingly capital mobile world, the concern on the part of Governments for the protection of their sources of revenue has increased. Adam Smith’s four <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> are well known. In his work, The Wealth of Nations, Smith regarded the values of certainty, equity, efficiency and convenience as integral to the functioning of a tax system. Among these, however, Smith would seem to have regarded certainty as of particular significance. The prominence afforded to the value of certainty, in conjunction with the smaller role afforded the state likely contributed to the formalistic approach taken by the courts of the British Commonwealth to the interpretation of taxing statutes. In recent times, however, the importance of certainty among policy makers and jurists has declined. Although this is not to contend that the value of certainty has ceased to be a consideration, it would seem to have come to be regarded as a lesser value among many rather than an end in itself. Although the optimal level of certainty within a jurisdiction is undoubtedly a matter for debate, the presence of uncertainty may carry with it a number of risks and unintended consequences which may hinder the achievement of the ends sought after by policy makers. These may include an increase in the rate of capital flight and in the use of asset sheltering devices, a decrease in the incidence of economic activity, and decreased rates of compliance among taxpayers. The value of certainty, in other words, may be of greater significance to the efficient functioning of a tax system than it has in recent times been thought to be. In contending with tax avoidance, the countries of the British Commonwealth tend to employ either one of two instruments; a statutory General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) or a judicial doctrine; an innovation of the common law. In this thesis, the writer sets out to examine the judicial doctrine applied in the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom (UK), and the statutory GAARs deployed in Canada and New Zealand, and the respective implications of each instrument for the value of certainty. While the difference in the implications presented by the application of a broad judicial doctrine and a narrow GAAR may be slight, it is the writer’s contention that, all things held equal, the use of a judicial doctrine is likely to have a less deleterious effect on the value of certainty than a GAAR. Accordingly, it is the writer’s contention that the use of a judicial doctrine is for this reason be preferred...|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the facts}} and judgment in CIR v Niko, involving the transfer of business assets from a sole trader to a company, the shares of which were substantially owned by the same sole trader. This case changed the inherently fl awed, but prevailing practice at that stage of regarding a lump-sum payment from a lock-stock-and-barrel sale of a business as a receipt of a capital nature, to a receipt {{that needed to be}} allocated to the various assets included in the sale, and therefore potentially the receipt would be partly of a capital and partly of a revenue nature. Although the conclusion relating to lock-stock-and-barrel sales in general was sound, the submission made in this article is that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the economic reality of the transaction was not considered – virtually no economic gain was realised by J. Niko, the seller and sole owner of the business to a company of which he was also the substantial shareholder. Two subsequent court decisions, which similarly ignored the economic reality of the transactions {{in the context of a}} group of companies, followed this judgment. In this article, the problematic nature of the decisions that ignored the economic reality of the transactions is demonstrated with reference to accepted <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> a good <b>taxation</b> system. The article also explains the partial legislative relief that has subsequently been granted for transfers of assets from a person to a company and for transfers within a group of companies, but concludes that there is a need for full recognition of a group of companies as an economic entity for tax purposes.
