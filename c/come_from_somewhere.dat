25|$|In contrast, {{in civil}} law jurisdictions, courts give the {{writings}} of law professors significant weight, partly because civil law decisions traditionally were very brief, sometimes {{no more than a}} paragraph stating who wins and who loses. The rationale had to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> else: the academy often filled that role.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} a rocket to work, it needs two things: {{reaction}} mass and energy. [...] The impulse provided by launching a particle of reaction mass having mass m at velocity v is mv. [...] But this particle has kinetic energy mv²/2, which must <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere.</b> In a conventional solid, liquid, or hybrid rocket, the fuel is burned, providing the energy, and the reaction products are allowed to flow out the back, providing the reaction mass. [...] In an ion thruster, electricity is used to accelerate ions out the back. Here some other source must provide the electrical energy (perhaps a solar panel or a nuclear reactor), whereas the ions provide the reaction mass.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Todd Carroll also {{states that}} a more likely source of the {{knowledge}} of the Sirius star system is from contemporary, terrestrial sources who provided information to interested members of the tribes. James Oberg, however, citing these suspicions notes their completely speculative nature, writing that, [...] "The obviously advanced astronomical knowledge must have <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere,</b> but is it an ancient bequest or a modern graft? Although Temple fails to prove its antiquity, the evidence for the recent acquisition of the information is still entirely circumstantial." [...] Additionally, James Clifford notes that Griaule sought informants best qualified to speak of traditional lore, and deeply mistrusted converts to Christianity, Islam, or people with too much contact with whites.|$|E
5000|$|... "I want {{to touch}} {{something}} that <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> impossible." ...|$|R
60|$|A gust of {{laughter}} <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> beyond. The burly soldier {{paused at the}} foot of the blockhouse.|$|R
60|$|While he remained, {{his face}} changing, shouts and hurrahs <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the {{direction}} of the river.|$|R
2500|$|Louis Pasteur remarked, about {{a finding}} of his in 1864 which he {{considered}} definitive, [...] "Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment." [...] One alternative was that life's origins on Earth had <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> else in the Universe. Periodically resurrected (see Panspermia, above) Bernal said that this approach [...] "is equivalent in the last resort to asserting the operation of metaphysical, spiritual entities... it turns on the argument of creation by design by a creator or demiurge." [...] Such a theory, Bernal said, was unscientific. A theory popular {{around the same time}} was that life was the result of an inner [...] "life force", which in the late 19th century was championed by Henri Bergson.|$|E
60|$|Soames turned {{square to}} him, {{with a sound}} which seemed to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> very deep.|$|E
60|$|All {{strained}} their ears, {{and from}} a great distance made out an answering cry. It appeared to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> above them.|$|E
6000|$|... "The call <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> inside," [...] said Sam. [...] "Come on in. But {{be on your}} guard, Songbird. We don't want to {{get into}} trouble." ...|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{the door}} had closed behind Marguerite, there <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the room {{the sound of a}} yawn, a grunt and a volley of oaths.|$|R
60|$|Her {{own hand}} at the moment was on that gilded knob of the door, through which she had been about to pass. His voice <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> close behind her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no--" [...] began Aurelia, but her {{own voice}} seemed to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> else, and being inexperienced in fainting, she was frightened.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have noticed}} for some time,' she said, 'a lurid glare over the Durnover {{end of the}} town. It seems to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> about Mixen Lane.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Ah Mr. Sapsea!” exclaimed {{the young}} man. “Disguise from you is impossible. You know already that I <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere,</b> and am going somewhere else. If I was to deny it, {{what would it}} avail me?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I am {{beginning}} to think the call <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> overhead,” answered our hero. “Captain, {{see if you can}} flash a light on those rocks to the left of our heads.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{meant that}} anybody {{could see that}} she <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> out in the wilds. As a matter of fact, Bill tells me that she was brought up in Snake Bite, Michigan." ...|$|R
6000|$|A loud thudding noise <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> downstairs. [...] "That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar," [...] said she. [...] "Her husband lies snoring on {{the kitchen}} rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle's." ...|$|R
60|$|A low rhythmic {{drumming}} {{that suggested}} {{the beat of}} hoofs rose from the waste, but it was lost as the branches rattled and the long grass swayed noisily before a rush of breeze. George thought the sound had <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> half a mile away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Softly, softly, child!" [...] said Thumb. [...] "It is {{only your}} giddy eyes rolling. What's more," [...] he said, pretending to laugh, [...] "those old hairy Men of the Mountains, {{even if only}} Meermuts, must have <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere.</b> Where they came from we can go to. O and Ahôh!" [...] he called.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he heard}} a queer, {{grunting}} sound, a very queer sound, that seemed to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> {{on the top of}} the hill. Jimmy grinned as he listened. [...] "That's Prickly Porky telling himself how good his dinner tastes," [...] laughed Jimmy. [...] "Funny how some people do like to hear their own voices." ...|$|E
50|$|Bělá Castle (Hrad Dolní Bělá) is {{a castle}} {{located in the}} Plzeň Region of the Czech Republic. The first mention of the castle <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> between 1315 and 1318. It {{is located in the}} village of Dolní Bělá near Plzeň.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly. There was an American family named Endicott over here. They <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> out West. They had a {{daughter}} about Laura's age, and the two were chums. I think your sister sailed with the Endicotts for the States." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> east," [...] {{answered}} the deacon, {{careful not to}} let the doctor know the place whence the stranger had come, though to little purpose, as will presently be seen. [...] "He has neither friend nor acquaintance, here; though I should think his effects sufficient to meet all charges." ...|$|R
6000|$|On this {{particular}} morning Peter {{happened to be}} sitting under some ferns {{on the edge of}} a little open space among the trees when again he heard that strange voice. It seemed to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> back in the woods in the very direction from which he had just come. [...] "Gobble-obble-obble!" [...] said the voice, and again a moment later [...] "Gobble-obble-obble!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Great heavens!" [...] said Good, {{starting}} up, [...] "I {{never thought}} of that. It can't come through the stone door, for it's air-tight, if ever a door was. It must <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere.</b> It there were no current of air in the place {{we should have been}} stifled or poisoned when we first came in. Let us have a look." ...|$|E
60|$|He thrilled {{from head}} to foot. This time {{there could be no}} mistake. It was the voice he knew so well, his wife's voice, and it had <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> down near the garden-gate. It is {{difficult}} to judge distance where sounds are concerned, but Mortimer estimated that the voice had spoken about a short mashie-niblick and an easy putt from where he stood.|$|E
5000|$|David Horton's Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia {{contains}} {{an article on}} Aboriginal mythology observing:"A mythic map of Australia would show thousands of characters, varying in their importance, but all in some way connected with the land. Some emerged at their specific sites and stayed spiritually in that vicinity. Others <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> else and went somewhere else." ...|$|R
60|$|Her head ached intolerably: {{that was}} the first {{conscious}} sensation which came to her; then she vaguely perceived a pale ray of sunshine, very hazy and narrow, which <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> {{in front of her and}} struck her in the face. She kept her eyes tightly shut, for that filmy light caused her an increase of pain.|$|R
60|$|And as Yvonne too in instinctive {{response}} to that peremptory call was further straining her every sense in order to listen, there <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere,</b> not very far away, right through {{the stillness of the}} night, a sound which caused her pulses to still their beating and her throat to choke with the cry which rose from her breast.|$|R
6000|$|The soldier looked {{round in}} surprise. [...] "I {{did not know}} Englishmen could speak our {{language}} so well; of course I noticed that your speech was not quite like mine, but I am {{from the south and}} I thought you must <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the north or from Poland. How did--" [...] and here he stopped. [...] "But I must not ask that; I don't want to know anything, not even your name. Look there, we are just going to pass a convoy of other prisoners." ...|$|E
6000|$|He stared his query, and I went on eagerly: [...] "That is {{what makes}} life at once so splendid and so strange. We are in the wrong world. When I {{thought that was the}} right town, it bored me; when I knew it was wrong, I was happy. So the false optimism, the modern {{happiness}}, tires us because it tells us we fit into this world. The true happiness is that we don't fit. We <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> else. We have lost our way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wait a moment,' {{answered}} {{a voice that}} seemed to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> very high up indeed. 'An eagle is playing with it just now, but he will be here with it in an instant;' {{and a few minutes}} after there was a sound of wings, and an eagle came fluttering towards them with the veil in his beak. And Ciccu saw it was the very same eagle that he had freed from the snare. So he took the veil and rode back to the king.|$|E
60|$|As she {{was gazing}} up the broad staircase, and had {{concluded}} that the voice <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> above, a rustle of dress attracted her attention. She {{looked down and saw}} a woman crossing the hall, having issued apparently through one of the many doors. Her face was averted, so that at first she was not aware of Miss Haldin.|$|R
6000|$|The {{rehearsal}} went on. The hero got off his line. There was {{a slight}} outburst of frightfulness between the stage-manager and a Voice named Bill that <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> near the roof, the subject under discussion being where the devil Bill's [...] "ambers" [...] were at that particular juncture. Then things went on again until the moment arrived for Cyril's big scene.|$|R
30|$|Tirumūlar {{explains}} jāgrit in suṣupti as {{that where}} nothing occurs. This {{is the state}} from which a person emerges into wakeful state knowing that he <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> but does not know the “where”. Svapna in suṣupti {{is the emergence of}} a feeling. Suṣupti in suṣupti is objective awareness getting destroyed by awareness or being aware of subjective awareness. Turiya in suṣupti is indescribable void (v 2203).|$|R
