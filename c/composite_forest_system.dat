High interception under <b>forest</b> <b>systems</b> therefore further limits water availability for recharging groundwater. In contrast, the managed LULC such as annual crops and grassland interception losses are lower (Williamson et al. 1987), which {{also contributes to}} the finding of higher groundwater recharge rates across the evaluated studies.|$|R

The logical reasoning and hierarchical structures of the <b>forest</b> multi-agent <b>system</b> can suitably capture the hierarchical property of the real systems and therefore is practically realistic. We propose further four classes of first-order BDI interpreted systems and four proof systems which are sound and complete with respect to corresponding classes of BDI interpreted systems.
