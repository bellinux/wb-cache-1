6000|$|Paley, {{a common}} {{authority}} with many on moral questions, in his chapter on the [...] "Duty of Submission to Civil Government," [...] resolves all <b>civil</b> <b>obligation</b> into expediency; and he proceeds {{to say that}} [...] "so long as {{the interest of the}} whole society requires it, that is, so long as the established government cannot be resisted or changed without public inconvenience, it is the will of God [...] . that the established government be obeyed--and no longer. This principle being admitted, the justice of every particular case of resistance is reduced to a computation of the quantity of the danger and grievance on the one side, and of the probability and expense of redressing it on the other." [...] Of this, he says, every man shall judge for himself. But Paley appears never to have contemplated those cases to which the rule of expediency does not apply, in which a people, as well as an individual, must do justice, cost what it may. If I have unjustly wrested a plank from a drowning man, I must restore it to him though I drown myself. This, according to Paley, would be inconvenient. But he that would save his life, in such a case, shall lose it. This people must cease to hold slaves, and to make war on Mexico, though it cost them their existence as a people.|$|E

50|$|Contract law forms {{part of the}} law of {{obligation}}s. An {{obligation is}} a legal bond (vinculum iuris) between two or more parties, obliging the obligor (the ‘debtor’) to give, do or refrain from doing something to or for the obligee (the ‘creditor’). The right created by an obligation is personal, a ius in personam, as opposed to a real right (ius in re). The words ‘creditor’ and ‘debtor’ apply not only in respect of a claim for money, but to a claim for anything else that is owed—whether unconditionally, conditionally, or in the future. If an obligation is enforceable by action in a court, it is a <b>civil</b> <b>obligation,</b> rather than the less common and unenforceable natural obligation. ‘The most important point’, in discussing the legal effect of contracts, is ‘the duty of the parties to perform their obligations’.|$|E

40|$|During the American Civil War, {{widely held}} Christian values and doctrines {{affected}} Confederate generals’ understanding and {{conduct of the}} war. This study examines the extent and the manner of religion’s influence on the war effort and the minds and lives of Confederate generals. Letters, diaries, and memoirs are used in addition to war reports and secondary sources to understand the range and complexity of this topic. Based on the supposition that each person’s religion is a unique relationship between {{a human being and}} his or her Creator, this study analyses the uniqueness of the generals’ religious beliefs using biographical details. Religion had a variety of effects on these Southern military leaders. Some high-ranking generals, such as Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, embraced the virtues of faith, hope and charity as the basis of their religious behaviour. Others such as Jubal Early simply used religion to instill morality and discipline in their soldiers. Confederate generals possessed religious convictions about slavery that enabled them to support or ignore the peculiar institution. Their understanding of Providence gave them confidence in the power of their armies, and in their petitions to God. Many Confederate generals performed their duty not only through a sense of <b>civil</b> <b>obligation</b> but also religious mission. Pious generals led their men and fought the war according to Christian ethics. Many Confederate military leaders died fighting not only for their country, but for their God. Religious beliefs, specifically a belief in absolute Providence, encouraged some generals to be reckless with their lives and to believe death was not the end of their existence, but rather a new beginning. This study examines some of the manifold relationships between religion and warfare in the Civil War South and argues that an understanding of the religious faith and practices of generals needs {{to be taken into account}} when writing military history. By integrating and comparing the religion of different Confederate generals this study offers a greater awareness of how religion influenced the conduct of the generals and the Civil War as a whole...|$|E
