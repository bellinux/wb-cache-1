Additionally, individuals who were highly food neophobic exhibited greater negative attitudes towards Chinese and Thai <b>cuisines.</b> Conversely, individuals who were low on the food neophobic continuum exhibited more positive attitudes towards the <b>cuisines...</b>|$|R

The author sets out to explore characteristic features of the culinary space of nine Baltic States {{as part of the}} global culinary space. The author uses empirical data on the number of restaurants serving different national <b>cuisines</b> in the main cities of the region. The Baltic culinary space incorporates the world’s leading <b>cuisines</b> (Italian, Japanese, Chinese, etc.) as well as the local <b>cuisines</b> of the BSR countries. The world’s leading <b>cuisines</b> prove to be more influential in the region than the local ones. Some countries of the Baltic Sea region (Russia, Poland, Sweden, Latvia, and Denmark) have culinary sovereignty, since their residents prefer national <b>cuisines.</b> In some other countries of the region (Finland, Estonia, and Lithuania), the public favours the world’s leading <b>cuisines</b> — Italian, Japanese and American — over the local ones. The non-capital Baltic cities of Poland and Germany, as well as St. Petersburg, display a greater sense of culinary patriotism than Warsaw, Berlin, and Moscow respectively.
