5|$|As {{elevation}} <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase,</b> {{only the}} hardiest trees {{remain in the}} forest, which is composed almost exclusively of balsam fir. Most of the understory plants and animals from the upper spruce-fir zone, however, {{can be found in}} this forest. Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped from the soil and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at a rate that is too slow to replenish them.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the San Juan {{watershed}} supported up to 12 invertebrate species, 5 fish species, 12 amphibian species, 35 reptile species, 143 bird species, and 42 mammal species, which {{benefited from}} the diverse vegetation communities present. Some streams and ponds host federally listed endangered/threatened species such as tidewater goby, fairy shrimp, and California red-legged frog. Federally listed bird species include least Bell's vireo, California gnatcatcher, California least tern, and southwestern willow flycatcher. Other listed species include Pacific pocket mouse and Quino checkerspot butterfly. As urbanization <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> in the San Juan watershed, most sensitive species have been pushed back to the foothills, mountains, and agricultural/ranching areas of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Rural {{areas in}} South Dakota are {{experiencing}} a trend of falling populations, despite an overall increase in population. The effect of rural flight {{has not been}} spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural counties and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area and the Black Hills have gained population. In fact, Lincoln County, near Sioux Falls, is the ninth fastest-growing county (by percentage) in the United States. The growth in these areas has compensated for losses {{in the rest of}} the state, and South Dakota's total population <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> steadily, albeit at a slower rate than the national average.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} rural flight {{has not been}} spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural {{counties}} and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area, the larger counties along Interstate 29, the Black Hills, and many Indian reservations have all gained population. As the reservations have exercised more sovereignty, some Sioux have returned to them from urban areas. Lincoln County near Sioux Falls was the seventh fastest-growing county (by percentage) in the United States in 2010. The growth in these areas has compensated for losses {{in the rest of}} the state. South Dakota's total population <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> steadily, albeit at a slower rate than the national average.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} use of the English language globally has {{had an effect on}} other languages, leading to some English words being assimilated into the vocabularies of other languages. This influence of English has led to concerns about language death, and to claims of linguistic imperialism, and has provoked resistance to the spread of English; however the number of speakers <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> because many people around the world think that English provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved lives.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{computer}} models, {{the presence of}} the Moon appears to stabilize the obliquity of the Earth, which may help the planet to avoid dramatic climate changes. This stability is achieved because the Moon increases the precession rate of the Earth's spin axis (that is, the precession motion of the ecliptic), thereby avoiding resonances between the precession of the spin and precession of the planet's orbital plane relative to that of Jupiter. However, as the semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase,</b> this stabilizing effect will diminish. At some point, perturbation effects will probably cause chaotic variations in the obliquity of the Earth, and the axial tilt may change by angles as high as 90° from the plane of the orbit. This is expected to occur between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E

5|$|By annual ridership, the New York City Subway is {{the busiest}} rapid transit rail system {{in both the}} Western Hemisphere and the Western world, {{as well as the}} seventh busiest rapid transit rail system in the world; only the metro (subway) systems in Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo, Guangzhou, and Moscow record higher annual ridership. In 2015, the subway {{delivered}} over 1.76 billion rides, averaging approximately 5.7 million daily rides on weekdays and a combined 5.9 million rides each weekend (3.3 million on Saturdays; 2.7 million on Sundays). Ridership <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase,</b> and on September 23, 2014, more than 6.1 million people rode the subway system, establishing the highest single-day ridership since ridership was regularly monitored in 1985.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{seventeen}} countries produced concentrated uranium oxides, with Canada (27.9% {{of world}} production) and Australia (22.8%) being the largest producers and Kazakhstan (10.5%), Russia (8.0%), Namibia (7.5%), Niger (7.4%), Uzbekistan (5.5%), the United States (2.5%), Argentina (2.1%), Ukraine (1.9%) and China (1.7%) also producing significant amounts. Kazakhstan <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> production {{and may have}} become the world's largest producer of uranium by 2009 with an expected production of 12,826tonnes, compared to Canada with 11,100t and Australia with 9,430t. In the late 1960s, UN geologists also discovered major uranium deposits and other rare mineral reserves in Somalia. The find was the largest of its kind, with industry experts estimating the deposits at over 25% of the world's then known uranium reserves of 800,000 tons.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, Babe begins blackmailing Les anonymously. Les' wife, Pam Coker (Lin Blakley), realises Babe is the blackmailer, but is too {{ashamed to}} report it so Babe <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> the blackmail amount. Babe later threatens to reveal photos of Les crossdressing, causing Pam to humiliate herself while {{the stress of the}} blackmail causes Les to suffer a heart attack. When Babe discovers that Abi and Lee had sex and that Abi has passed on an STI to Lee's pregnant girlfriend, Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Babe badly burns Abi's hand. After the fling is exposed, Abi informs the Carter family about Babe's involvement and the family subsequently disown her. At a low ebb, Babe begins blackmailing the Cokers again, despite the recent death of their grandson, Paul, as well as threatening Abi. Pam eventually confides in Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) about the blackmail and she threatens Babe to stop it.|$|E

Examples of homegrown bands include the popular Romanian rock band Compact, the modern pop band Sistem—which {{finished third in the}} Eurovision Song Contest 2005, the rhythm and blues band Nightlosers, the alternative band Luna Amară, Grimus—the winners of the 2007 National Finals of Global Battle of the Bands, as well as a large assortment of electronic music producers, notably Horace Dan D. The Cheeky Girls also grew up in the city, where they studied at the High School of Choreography and Dramatic Art. While many discos play commercial house music, the city has an increasing minimal techno scene, and, to an extent jazz/blues and heavy metal/punk. The city's nightlife, particularly its club scene, grew significantly in the 1990s, and <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase.</b> Most entertainment venues are dispersed throughout the city centre, spreading from the oldest one of all, Diesel Club, on Unirii Square. The list of large and fancy clubs continues with Obsession The Club and Midi, the latter being a venue for the new minimal techno music genre. These three clubs are classified as the top three clubs in the Transylvania-Banat region in a chart published by the national daily România Liberă. The Unirii area also features the Fashion Bar, with an exclusive terrace sponsored by Fashion TV. Some other clubs in the centre are Aftereight, Avenue, Bamboo, Decadence, Kharma and Molotov Pub. Numerous restaurants, pizzerias and coffee shops provide regional as well as international cuisine; many of these offer cultural activities like music and fashion shows or art exhibitions.|$|E

25|$|Other {{research}} findings report {{a projection of}} opposite trend. Although the demand for nurses <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase,</b> the rate of employment has slowed down since 1994 because hospitals were incorporating more less-skilled nursing personnel to substitute for nurses. With the decrease in employment, the earnings for nurses decreased. Wage among nurses leveled off in correlation with inflation between 1990 and 1994. The recent economic crisis of 2009 has further decreased the demand for RNs.|$|E
