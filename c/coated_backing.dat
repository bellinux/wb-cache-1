40|$|International audienceMagnetron {{sputtering}} deposition {{has already}} demonstrated its ability for the fabrication of efficient PEMFCelectrodes with high Pt utilization rate. As the nanoparticle growth by sputtering methods is atomic by nature, simulations {{at the molecular}} level areexpected to be relevant for understanding basic mechanisms of this deposition method. Indeed, moleculardynamics (MD) as being able to exactly calculating the trajectory of atomic systems is a suitable method foraddressing this topic, especially in the context of plasma sputtering. Very recently, it has been shown thatMD simulations allowed confirming and predicting the morphology and structure of Pt nanocatalysts. As bimetallic Pt alloys can improve the activity and stability of PEMFC’s catalysts, MD simulations on PtxX (Xbeing a less noble or common metal) deposition and growth are carried out for studying the preferredmorphology and structure (size, geometry, atomic arrangements…) of such clusters. Both formation methods,i. e. on the surface or during time of flight to substrate, is also addressed for understanding the best growthmode for catalyst <b>coated</b> <b>backing</b> or membrane. Radial distribution functions and X-Ray Diffraction pattern aresystematically computed for enabling direct comparison with experiments...|$|E

50|$|Carbonless {{copy paper}} {{consists}} of {{sheets of paper}} that are coated with micro-encapsulated dye or ink or a reactive clay. The back of the first sheet is coated with micro-encapsulated dye (referred to as a <b>Coated</b> <b>Back</b> or CB sheet). The lowermost sheet is coated on the top surface with a clay that quickly reacts with the dye to form a permanent mark (Coated Front, CF). Any intermediate sheets are coated with clay on top and dye on the bottom (<b>Coated</b> Front and <b>Back,</b> CFB).|$|R

50|$|The {{application}} of the clay in different thicknesses to the blade allows the steel to cool more quickly along the thinner coated edge when plunged into the tank of water and thereby develop into the harder form of steel called martensite, which can be ground to razor-like sharpness. The thickly <b>coated</b> <b>back</b> cools more slowly retaining the pearlite steel characteristics of relative softness and flexibility. The precise {{way in which the}} clay is applied, and partially scraped off at the edge, is a determining factor {{in the formation of the}} shape and features of the crystalline structure known as the hamon. This distinctive tempering line found near the edge is one of the main characteristics to be assessed when examining a blade.|$|R
