The dependence of KSV on ionic strength, <b>charge</b> and <b>conjugation</b> length of the polymer, and the dimensions (and thus optical properties) of the nanoparticles suggests that three factors account for this extraordinary efficiency: (i) amplification of the quenching via rapid internal energy or electron transfer, (ii) electrostatic interactions between the cationic polymer and anionic nanoparticles, and (iii) the ability of gold nanoparticles to quench via efficient energy transfer.

The morphological transformation process of rod-shaped gold nanoparticles resulting from the interaction with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) showed the role of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in nanostructures as the main interacting agent.

The only known common property of these anticarcinogens is {{their ability to}} elevate in animal cells the activities of enzymes that inactivate the reactive electrophilic forms of carcinogens. Structure-activity studies on the induction of quinone reductase [NAD(P) H:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase, EC 1. 6. 99. 2] and glutathione S-transferases have revealed that many anti-carcinogenic enzyme inducers contain a distinctive and hitherto unrecognized chemical feature (or acquire this feature after metabolism) that regulates the synthesis of these protective enzymes. The inducers are Michael reaction acceptors characterized by olefinic (or acetylenic) bonds that are rendered electrophilic (positively <b>charged)</b> by <b>conjugation</b> with electron-withdrawing substrates. The potency of inducers parallels their efficiency in Michael reactions. Many inducers are also substrates for glutathione S-transferases, which is further evidence for their electrophilicity.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{nanoparticle}} <b>charge</b> and <b>conjugation</b> {{to the cell}} penetrating peptide Tat on the uptake of nanoparticles into MRC- 5 fibroblasts was investigated using a range of advanced imaging techniques including atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) and fluorescence microscopy. New technologies are required to investigate the uptake of nanoparticles since although many studies have examined their destination within cells, little {{work has been done}} looking at the interaction between the nanoparticles and cell which also plays an important role. Polyacrylamide nanoparticles showed a clear correlation between increased positive charge and cellular uptake. These results obtained using fluorescence microscopy correlated well with those observed using AFM. Nanoparticles with low levels of positive charge caused minor effects on bilayer structure such as fusion of holes in the bilayer, whilst negatively charged nanoparticles had no effect on the bilayer. Polyacrylamide nanoparticles conjugated to the cell penetrating peptide Tat displayed greater cell uptake and increased effects on the bilayer depth and coverage than the similarly charged nanoparticles alone. This indicated that the peptide leads to enhanced uptake by additional mechanisms other than just the presence of a positive charge. In contrast, silica nanoparticles with high levels of positive and negative charge entered cells to a similar extent. However, when the interaction with the cell membrane was imaged using Scanning Surface Confocal Microscopy (SSCM), there were differences. Nanoparticles possessing a negative charge were often found to be associated with extensions of the membrane. Positively charged particles were also found associated with membrane extensions in some cases but were also observed isolated on the membrane.

The model possesses the <b>charge</b> and particle <b>conjugation</b> symmetries. These symmetries mandate the reflection symmetry of the spectrum about the line E= 0. We obtain the bound state energies and wave functions of the fermion in this model using two different methods, analytically and exactly, for every arbitrary choice of the parameters of the kink, i. e. its value at spatial infinity (θ_ 0) and its scale of variations (μ). Then, we plot the bound state energies of the fermion as a function of θ_ 0. This graph enables us to consider a process of building up the kink from the trivial vacuum. We can then determine the origin and evolution of the bound state energy levels during this process. We see that the model has a dynamical mass generation process at the first quantized level and the zero-energy fermionic mode responsible for the fractional fermion number, is always present during the construction of the kink and its origin is very peculiar, indeed. We also observe that, as expected, none of the energy levels crosses each other. Moreover, we obtain analytically the continuum scattering wave functions of the fermion and then calculate the phase shifts of these wave functions. Using the information contained in the graphs of the phase shifts and the bound states, we show that our phase shifts are consistent with the weak and strong forms of the Levinson theorem. Finally, using the weak form of the Levinson theorem, we confirm that the number of the zero-energy fermionic modes is exactly one. Comment: 11 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

40|$|Degradable {{polymeric}} {{materials such as}} hydrogels are extensively utilized as delivery vehicles due to their biocompatibility and tunable properties. Encapsulating therapeutic agents inside hydrogels stabilizes the cargo by preventing degradation, extending circulation time, and also allows for targeted release and delivery. Due to their small size and tunable properties, nano-scale hydrogels, or nanogels, are frequently utilized to deliver therapeutics to areas difficult to reach, such as tumors and the cytoplasm, through traditional means. To control hydro- and nanogel function, degradable cross-links can be installed, allowing for cargo release in response to specific stimuli, such as hydrolysis or reduction. This dissertation offers three degradable strategies {{that can be applied}} to synthesize hydrogels and nanogels for the stabilization and release of therapeutic cargo. In the first example, mixed imine cross-linking chemistry was applied to synthesize poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) -based hydrogels with tunable degradability to encapsulate and deliver cells. Time to degradation of the gels could be controlled from 24 hours to more than 7 days by varying the hydrazone structure and the ratio of hydrazone and oxime cross-links. Encapsulated cells exhibited high viability up to at least 7 days, suggesting this system may be useful for cell delivery applications. In the second example, disulfide cross-links were utilized to form redox-responsive nanogels comprised of trehalose copolymers. The synthesis of a methacrylate trehalose monomer (TrMA) was optimized, improving the overall yield from 14 % to 42 %. TrMA was subsequently copolymerized with pyridyl disulfide ethyl methacrylate (PDSMA) using free radical polymerization conditions to form copolymers with two monomer ratios (1 : 1 and 2 : 1) which were cross-linked with 1 kDa PEG-dithiol via disulfide exchange to form uniform nanogels approximately 9 nm in diameter. The addition of a cross-linker eliminated the need to add reducing agent to facilitate cross-linking and nanogel formation, making this approach ideal for the encapsulation of sensitive therapeutic agents. Next, PDSMA-co-TrMA nanogels were utilized to encapsulate, stabilize, and release glucagon, an unstable peptide hormone used to treat hypoglycemia. The amines on glucagon were modified with thiol groups while retaining their positive <b>charges</b> for reversible <b>conjugation</b> and cross-linking. Glucagon-nanogel conjugates were synthesized with > 80 % conjugation yield, and the reversible disulfide linkage between peptide and polymer allowed for efficient cargo release under mild reducing conditions. The nanogels stabilized glucagon against aggregation in solution up to five days as well as solubilized the peptide at neutral pH. In vitro bioactivity of the modified peptide was found to be comparable to native glucagon, suggesting this may be a promising formulation strategy for further in vivo study. Finally, a series of dual-enzyme responsive peptides was synthesized by masking the ε-amine of lysine with protease substrates. After unmasking the amine by enzymatic cleavage, a second enzyme was able to cleave at the C terminus of lysine, which was monitored colorimetrically. Three different dual-enzyme responsive peptides were prepared, (AcAAF) K-pNA, (AcFG) K-pNA, and (AcDEVD) K-pNA, for chymotrypsin, papain, and caspase 3 sensitivity, respectively, followed by trypsin sensitivity after cleavage by the first enzyme.
