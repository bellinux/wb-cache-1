40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{functionality}} {{of the units}} used in <b>connectionist</b> <b>Artificial</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Artificial</b> Neural Networks form {{the foundation of the}} research and their units, Artificial Neurons, are first compared with alternative models. This initial work is mainly in the spatial-domain and introduces a new neural model, termed a Taylor Series neuron. This is designed to be flexible enough to assume most mathematical functions. The unit is based on Power Series theory and a specifically implemented Taylor Series neuron is demonstrated. These neurons are of particular usefulness in evolutionary networks as they allow the complexity to increase without adding units. Training is achieved via various traditiona and derived methods based on the Delta Rule, Backpropagation, Genetic Algorithms and associated evolutionary techniques. This new neural unit has been presented as a controllable and more highly functional alternative to previous models. The work on the Taylor Series neuron moved into time-domain behaviour and through the investigation of neural oscillators led to an examination of single-celled intelligence from which the later work developed. <b>Connectionist</b> approaches to <b>Artificial</b> <b>Intelligence</b> are almost always based on Artificial Neural Networks. However, another route towards Parallel Distributed Processing was introduced. This was inspired by the intelligence displayed by single-celled creatures called Protoctists (Protists). A new system based on networks of interacting proteins was introduced. These networks were tested in pattern-recognition and control tasks in the time-domain and proved more flexible than most neuron models. They were trained using a Genetic Algorithm and a derived Backpropagation Algorithm. Termed "Artificial BioChemical Networks" (ABN) they have been presented as an alternative approach to connectionist systems. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Today, {{symbolic}} and <b>connectionist</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> have proved their complementary efficiency for {{various aspects of}} cognitive processing. Both approaches {{can be seen as}} complementarily acting on specific parts of information, namely data and knowledge. Such a dichotomy can also be observed as one consider real world applications. A general theory is rarely available to build a complete knowledge based system. Conversely, data can generally be extracted from the problem but never cover the whole problem. Accordingly, the idea has emerged that the combination of {{symbolic and}} connectionist tools could be a way to benefit from the advantages of both approaches. Neurosymbolic integration that will be presented here is the domain whose goal is to define strategies and propose tools for the cooperation of symbolic and <b>connectionist</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with copyright regulation of works created by <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>systems.</b> The rapid advances in <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> are calling into question some of the fundamental assumptions upon which intellectual property law rests. Currently, the European framework of copyright law does not take non-human innovation into account. Meanwhile, advances in <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> are quickly making machine-generation of creative works a reality. Institutions of the European Union have recently explicitly addressed the need to clarify legal implications of advancements in <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> In this regard, two research questions have been analysed in the thesis: First, whether works co-created or independently created by <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>systems</b> are eligible for copyright protection under current EU copyright law. Second, to whom, if anyone, should the rights to works entirely generated by <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>systems</b> be allocated...|$|R
