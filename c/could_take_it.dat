Army {{investigators}} later found the SD card in Manning's basement room in her aunt's home, in Potomac, Maryland. On January 23, Manning flew to the United States via Germany, for two weeks of leave. It was during this visit that she first went out dressed as a woman, wearing a wig and makeup. After her arrest, her former partner, Tyler Watkins, told Wired that Manning had said during the visit that she had found some sensitive information and was considering leaking it.|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} government captured numerous (mostly Dutch) men and women, both {{clergy and}} laymen, and instituted policies that changed how services were held. They forbade {{the use of}} Dutch in services and in writing, and seized several church properties. Soegijapranata attempted to resist these seizures, at times filling the locations with people to make them unmanageable or indicating that other buildings, such as cinemas, would serve Japanese needs better. When the Japanese attempted to seize Randusari Cathedral, Soegijapranata replied that they <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> only after decapitating him; the Japanese later found another location for their office. He prevented the Japanese from taking Gedangan Presbytery, where he lived, and assigned guardians for schools and other facilities to prevent seizure. These efforts were not always successful, however, and several Church-run institutions were seized, as were church funds.|$|E

In 1983 there were seven challengers for the cup competing for the inaugural Louis Vuitton Cup, the winner of which would go on to the America's Cup match against the NYYC's yacht selected in their trials. Bond's yacht, Australia II, designed by Ben Lexcen, skippered by John Bertrand, and representing the Royal Perth Yacht Club, easily won the Louis Vuitton challenger series, and Dennis Conner in Liberty was selected for the Cup defense.|$|E
25|$|During the 2003 provincial election, the Saskatchewan Party {{campaigned on}} a {{platform}} of tax reduction and decreased government involvement in the private sector. The party won 28 seats, while the NDP won 30 seats. The party was accused of having undisclosed plans to privatize the province's crown corporations. Hermanson stated he would not sell the four major crown corporations, but would consider offers. The NDP used the ambiguity in the Saskatchewan Party's position to turn the election into a referendum on crown corporation ownership for many voters, and won the one seat it needed to regain a majority government. Hermanson resigned as leader shortly afterward. He stated he had taken the party as far as he could, and {{it was time for the}} party to elect a new leader who <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> further.|$|E

Patti LuPone was appearing in Anything Goes on Broadway around that time, so Paige sought to become the co-producer of the West End production as a way to secure the role there before LuPone <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> [...] Playing Reno Sweeney was Paige's first experience using an American accent on stage, and the role earned her a third Olivier Award nomination. Beyond her theatre roles, she appeared in the television programme Unexplained Laughter in 1989 alongside Diana Rigg.|$|E

500|$|As a manager, he was {{a strict}} disciplinarian, {{possibly}} {{a result of his}} military background. [...] Carroll [...] "Dink" [...] Mothell maintained that [...] "Rogan wanted to run the ball club like they did it in the army. He liked to give orders too much, even before he was managing. He used to bawl players out for different things. I <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> but we had ball players, when he'd get on them, they'd go into a shell, resented it, and didn't give him their best." [...] Another Monarchs pitcher, Chet Brewer, said that [...] "Rogan wasn't the best manager because he was such a great ball player himself. [...] He couldn't teach pitchers much, because he'd say, 'All {{you have to do is}} go out and throw the man what I threw'." [...] According to historian Phil Dixon, [...] "In Rogan's first few years as manager he was reluctant to pinch-hit for many of the veterans on his roster because they were his friends." [...] He didn't trust younger players, often inserting himself to pitch or pinch-hit for them. He sometimes treated rookies harshly. Eventually Rogan [...] "discarded his distant approach" [...] and became increasingly known for teaching and developing less experienced players.|$|E
500|$|Some {{hardcore}} punk bands made {{a conscious}} decision to avoid putting Reagan in their lyrics. In wanting his music to outlast the administration, [...] Washington, D.C. musician Ian MacKaye, who was in the bands Minor Threat, Embrace, Pailhead, and Fugazi during the Reagan years, has said, [...] "I remember clearly resisting the urge to put the word 'Reagan' in any of the songs". In the late 1980s U.S. skinheads spearheaded a patriotic right-wing faction within the New York hardcore scene, and although bands like Agnostic Front and Cro Mags did not reference the president directly in their lyrics, their support of Reagan fell within their interpretation of patriotic backlash that reimagined hardcore without the antiestablishment ethos of punk rock. Some groups' stances on the president were a bit more ambiguous. When the drunk-rock group Murphy's Law praised Reagan and his films in their 1986 song [...] "California Pipeline," [...] fans <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> as either actual pro-Republican patriotism, or a tongue-in-cheek take on anti-Reagan irony. By the late 1980s, reference to Reagan in hardcore music had become so commonplace that the joke was no longer on the president, but on a punk scene where bands were practically obliged to put a Reagan song on their setlist or album.|$|E
500|$|Although {{her husband}} {{was aware of the}} books she was writing, he showed no {{interest}} in the subject. He was interested enough in the money she made from them, however, but had forbidden her to use her married surname, not wishing to see it on a book cover with art of questionable taste. She took the name [...] "Bannon" [...] from a list of his customers and liked it because it contained her own name in it. She continued to experience difficulty in her marriage, however, and in realizing that [...] "not all lesbians were nice people", she took these frustrations out on her characters. [...] "I couldn't stand some of what was happening to me–but Beebo <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> Beebo really, in a way, had my nervous breakdown for me...I think I was overwhelmed with grief and anger that I was not able to express," [...] she recalled later. Women in the Shadows was also published in 1959 and proved very unpopular with Bannon's readers. The book examined interracial relationships, self-loathing in matters of sexuality and race, alcoholism, jealousy, violence, and as Laura marries Jack in an atypical arrangement in the 1950s, also explored the intricate details {{of what it was like}} to pass as heterosexual in an attempt to live some semblance of what was considered a normal life at the time.|$|E

500|$|Following the album's release, Charles quickly {{earned an}} influx of white {{listeners}} and audiences at concert venues, without experiencing any fall-out from his predominantly black audience. Writer Daniel Cooper later said of the album's effect, [...] "It's an idea as corny as any country song you can think of, and one that Charles knew to be true; music unites people. It just really does." [...] Throughout the years following its initial reception, Modern Sounds gained further acknowledgment of {{its impact on the}} music industry and society. Through conceiving and recording the album, Charles {{became one of the first}} African-American musicians to receive and practice artistic control bestowed upon by a mainstream record company. In a 1998 interview, country musician Raul Malo acknowledged the album's influence, calling it [...] "one of the most important records of our time, not only because of its content, but also due to its social and political ramifications." [...] In a July 8, 2004 article for Rolling Stone magazine, music journalist Robert Christgau praised the impact and influence that the Modern Sounds recordings had on music, stating [...] "In the world it created, not only could a black person sing the American songbook Ella Fitzgerald owned by then, but a country black person <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> over. Soon Charles's down-home diction, cotton-field grit, corn-pone humor and overstated shows of emotion were standard operating procedure in American music, black and white." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{tone was}} {{inspired}} by a discussion with editor Nicholas Porteous about a review of Ang Lee's film Hulk, in which a producer theorized that the film was seen as a commercial failure [...] "because it wasn’t dark and gritty, like Batman Begins". Natale found the idea that Begins succeeded solely due to its tone insulting to its director Christopher Nolan, and joked with Majdoub on the popularity of 'dark' series reboots, pondering what series would be good for a live-action adaptation. Settling on Pokémon due to its undertones of animal rights abuse, Majdoub wanted to approach the film from a completely mature standpoint. Displeased with the current trend of video game to film adaptations, they wished to [...] "see how far we <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> without being absolutely ridiculous". A variety of locations were worked in to give the completed project a proper trailer feel. The title Pokémon Apokélypse was chosen as nod to Apocalypse Now, due to the similarity of the shooting ratios, with only ten percent of the footage actually used. Though several scenes were shot to add more content to the film, others using dialogue and one-liners from the anime series were purposefully shot in longer scenes then cropped down, in order to ensure the lines did not feel forced and to give a sense that [...] "here is a world beyond what is shown in the trailer".|$|E
