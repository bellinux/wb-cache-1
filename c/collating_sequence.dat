NoV GII. 4 variants have caused six pandemics since 1995 and novel variants emerge {{every two to}} three years. The recent pandemic variant, GII. 4 Sydney 2012, has been the predominant genotype since 2013. Recently, a previously rare genotype, GII. 17, was detected as the dominant genotype in Asia and in sporadic AGE cases around the world. This thesis aimed to evaluate NoV genotype distribution in the Oceania region between 2013 and 2015. Three comprehensive studies were performed in NSW (2014 - 2015), WA (2013 - 2014) and NZ (2013 - 2014). <b>Collated</b> <b>sequence</b> data was used for genotyping, recombination detection and to study capsid antigenic variation. Overall, 391 NoV outbreaks and 205 individual cases were identified in this study. The majority of outbreaks occurred in aged-care facilities (59. 3 %) followed by commercial food operators (10. 9 %), childcare centres (9. 9 %) and hospitals (7. 2 %). RT-PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses revealed NoV GII. 4 Sydney 2012 as the dominant genotype (54. 7 %- 70. 4 %) in all three regions. Twenty non-GII. 4 capsid genotypes were identified including GII. 7 (13. 8 %), GII. 6 (12. 9 %), GI. 3 (11. 9 %) and GII. 13 (11. 5 %). NZ reported majority of the NoV GI strains (94. 6 %). Co-circulation of different NoV genotypes increases the chances of coinfections and recombination, which is an important mechanism of NoV evolution. Recombination at the ORF 1 /ORF 2 junction facilitates an exchange of non-structural (ORF 1) and structural (ORF 2) genes that can confer selective advantages on the virus. A total of 21 intergenotypic recombinants and one intragenotype recombinant (GII. P 4 New Orleans 2009 /GII. 4 Sydney 2012) were detected. Two emerging epidemic strains, GII. P 16 /GII. 4 Sydney 2012 and GII. P 17 /GII. 17 were also identified. Variation in the GII. 4 capsid sequence has been reported to alter viral antigenicity resulting in immune evasion. VP 1 analyses of GII. 4 Sydney 2012 (n= 26) and GII. 17 (n= 1) strains showed mutations within the hypervariable P 2 domain. These results highlight constant NoV evolution, which requires routine surveillance to effectively track it and predict potential pandemic-causing novel variants. In summary, this thesis described NoV molecular epidemiology in the Oceania region from 2013 to 2015 and explored the dynamic interplay of antigenic drift and shift in NoV evolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{zinc finger}} motifs (Cys 2 His 2) {{are found in}} several {{proteins}} {{playing a role in}} the regulation of transcripton. SmZF 1, a Schistosoma mansoni gene encoding a zinc finger protein was initially isolated from an adult worm cDNA library, as a partial cDNA. The full sequence of the gene was obtained by subcloning and sequencing cDNA and genomic fragments. The <b>collated</b> gene <b>sequence</b> is 2181 nt and the complete cDNA sequence is 705 bp containing the full open reading frame of the gene. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed the presence of three introns interrupting the coding region. The open reading frame theoretically encodes a protein of 164 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 18, 667 Da. The predicted protein contains three zinc finger motifs, usually present in transcription regulatory proteins. PCR amplification with specific primers for the gene allowed for the detection of the target in egg, cercariae, schistosomulum and adult worm cDNA libraries indicating the expression of the mRNA in these life cycle stages of S. mansoni. This pattern of expression suggests the gene plays a role in vital functions of different life cycle stages of the parasite. Future research will be directed to elucidate the functional role of SmZF 1.

30|$|Observations of solo {{females were}} {{collected}} from November to December 2004, and paired females were observed in January 2005 by a single observer. The process used to identify females meant that it could take several attempts before a female was identified from the stock culture and an observation completed. Only one or two 30  min observations were completed sequentially during the morning of any 1  day to minimise observer fatigue. All observational data were recorded in real time by using the Observer 5.0 (Noldus Information Technology, [URL] on a handheld device. This is event logging software designed specifically for direct recording of behaviour. The software can calculate the duration and frequency of different behaviours for an individual observation or across groups of observations as required. It is also possible to <b>collate</b> behavioural <b>sequence</b> data, e.g. determine how often drumming was followed by probing. To summarise behavioural sequences, {{the probability of a}} particular transition from one behaviour to another behaviour for either all solo or all paired observations was calculated as follows: the frequency that behaviour 1 was followed by behaviour 2 divided by the total frequency of behaviour 1. For example, out of 71 occasions when solo females were resting on the host egg batch, there were 60 occasions when next behaviour was drumming, so the probability that ‘rest on host’ is followed by ‘drum’ is 60 / 71 [*]=[*] 0.85. The observational data can also be exported from the Observer into a spreadsheet to conduct additional statistical analyses not available within the programme itself.|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of a protein's structure with its known sequence variation provides insight on how that protein evolves, {{for instance in}} terms of (changing) function or immunogenicity. Yet, <b>collating</b> the corresponding <b>sequence</b> variants into a multiple sequence alignment, calculating each position's conservation, and mapping this information back onto a relevant structure is not straightforward. We therefore built the Sequence Conservation on Protein 3 D structure (scop 3 D) tool to perform these tasks automatically. The output consists of two modified PDB files in which the B-values for each position are replaced by the percentage sequence conservation, or the information entropy for each position, respectively. Furthermore, text files with absolute and relative amino acid occurrences for each position are also provided, along with snapshots of the protein from six distinct directions in space. The visualization provided by scop 3 D can for instance {{be used as an}} aid in vaccine development or to identify antigenic hotspots, which we here demonstrate based on an analysis of the fusion proteins of human respiratory syncytial virus and mumps virus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Despite phylogeographical {{patterns}} {{being well}} characterised {{in a large}} number of species, and generalised patterns emerging, the carnivores do not all appear to show consistent trends. While some species tend to fit with standard theoretical phylogeographic expectations (e. g. bears), others show little obvious modern phylogeographic structure (e. g. wolves). In this study we briefly review these studies, and present a new phylogeographical study of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) throughout Europe, using a combination of ancient DNA sequences obtained from museum specimens, and modern <b>sequences</b> <b>collated</b> from GenBank. We used cytochrome b (250 bp) and the mitochondrial control region (268 bp) to elucidate both current and historical phylogeographical patterning. Results We found evidence for slight isolation by distance in modern populations, as well as differentiation associated with time, both of which can likely be attributed to random genetic drift. Despite high sequence diversity (11. 2 % cytochrome b, 16. 4 % control region), no evidence for spatial structure (from Bayesian trees) is found either in modern samples or ancient samples for either gene, and Bayesian skyline plots suggested little change in the effective population size over the past 40, 000 years. Conclusions It is probable that the high dispersal ability and adaptability of the red fox has contributed to the lack of observable differentiation, which appears to have remained consistent over tens of thousands of years. Generalised patterns of how animals are thought to have responded to historical climatic change are not necessarily valid for all species, and so understanding the differences between species will be critical for predicting how species will be affected by future climatic change. </p...|$|R

50|$|Alternate <b>Collating</b> <b>Sequence</b> (ACS) {{pages are}} pages that allow records to be sorted in a {{different}} order. Collation is the assembly of written information into a standard order. In common usage, this is called alphabetisation, though collation {{is not limited to}} ordering letters of the alphabet.

This can serve to apply the correct conventions used for alphabetical ordering in the language in question, dealing properly with differently cased letters, modified letters, digraphs, particular abbreviations, and so on, as mentioned above under Alphabetical order, and in detail in the Alphabetical order article. Such algorithms are potentially quite complex, possibly requiring several passes through the text.|$|E
50|$|The letter 'W' is rare. Before the 19th century, 'W' was {{interchangeable}} with 'V' ('W' {{was used}} in Fraktur, 'V' in Antiqua). Official orthographic standards since 1801 use only 'V' for common words. Many family names kept their 'W' despite the change to common words. Foreign words and names bring in uses of 'W', particularly combinations with webb for (World Wide) Web. Swedish sorting traditionally and officially treated 'V' and 'W' as equivalent, so that users {{would not have to}} guess whether the word, or name, they were seeking was spelled with a 'V' or a 'W'. The two letters were often combined in the <b>collating</b> <b>sequence</b> as if they were all 'V' (or all 'W'), until 2006 when the 13th edition of Svenska Akademiens ordlista. By 2006, 'W' had grown in usage because of new loanwords, so 'W' officially became a letter, and the 'V' = 'W' sorting rule was deprecated. Pre-2006 books and software generally use the rule (unless the authors did not know about or chose not to implement this unusual rule). After the rule was deprecated, some books and software continued to apply it. Visual Studio 2010 documentation shows the rule still in effect. (The Swedish Academy's Orthographic Dictionary) declared a change.|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, data {{is ordered}} to {{facilitate}} further processing or to {{enable you to}} quickly find information in a report or other form of data presentation. The SAS System’s primary means of achieving an alternative <b>collating</b> <b>sequence</b> has been to specify a translation table (TRANTAB), using the PROC SORT SORTSEQ option, with which PROC SORT can reorder individual characters. SAS ® 9. 2 extends the SORTSEQ option to enable the specification of an arbitrary encoding for non-native binary collation. SAS 9. 2 also extends the SORTSEQ option to enable the specification of linguistic collation, which is useful for presenting data because it produces results that are more intuitive and culturally acceptable. The linguistic collation capability is highly compatible with the Unicode Collation Algorithm and adaptable to user preference using various options. In this paper, we describe the four collation capabilities offered by PROC SORT in SAS. We further detail the applicability, the advantages, the processing requirements, and the processing implications of each approach. We conclude with information regarding the future directions of collation and sorting within the SAS System...|$|E
