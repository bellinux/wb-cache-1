The generators are the minimal ones among the equivalent itemsets, while the <b>closed</b> <b>pattern</b> is the maximum one. As a generator is usually smaller than the <b>closed</b> <b>pattern</b> in cardinality, by the Minimum Description Length Principle, the generator is preferable to the <b>closed</b> <b>pattern</b> in inductive inference and classification. To efficiently discover frequent generators from a large dataset, we develop a depth-first algorithm called Gr-growth. The idea is novel in contrast to traditional breadth-first bottom-up generator-mining algorithms. Our extensive performance study shows that Gr-growth is significantly faster (an order or even two orders of magnitudes when the support thresholds are low) than the existing generator mining algorithms. It can be also faster than the state-of-the-art frequent closed itemset mining algorithms such as FPclose and CLOSET+...|$|E

40|$|Sequential pattern mining ¯rst {{proposed}} by Agrawal and Srikant has received intensive research {{due to its}} wide range applicability in many real-life domains. Various improvements have been proposed which include mining a closed set of sequential patterns. Sequential patterns supported by the same sequences in the database {{can be considered as}} belonging to an equivalence class. Each equivalence class contains patterns partially-ordered by sub-sequence relationship and having the same support. Within an equivalence class, the set of maximal and minimal patterns are referred to as <b>closed</b> <b>patterns</b> and generators respectively. Generators used together with <b>closed</b> <b>patterns</b> can provide additional information which <b>closed</b> <b>patterns</b> alone are not able to provide. Also, as generators are the minimal members, they are preferable over <b>closed</b> <b>patterns</b> for model selection and classi¯cation based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Several algorithms have been proposed for mining <b>closed</b> sequential <b>patterns,</b> but none so far for mining sequential generators. This paper ¯lls this research gap by investigating properties of sequential generators and proposing an algorithm to e±ciently mine sequential generators. The algorithm works on a three-step process of search space compaction, non-generator pruning and a ¯nal ¯ltering step.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{theoretical}} insights {{have led}} to the introduction of efficient algorithms for mining closed item-sets. This paper investigates potential generalizations of this paradigm to mine <b>closed</b> <b>patterns</b> in relational, graph and network databases.

The paper investigates these implications in the context of generalizing the LCM algorithm, an algorithm for enumerating closed item-sets. LCM is attractive since its run time is linear in the number of <b>closed</b> <b>patterns</b> and since it does not need to store the patterns output in order to avoid duplicates, further reducing memory signature and run time. Our investigation shows that the choice of semantics has a dramatic effect on the properties of <b>closed</b> <b>patterns</b> and as a result, in some settings a generalization of the LCM algorithm is not possible. On the other hand, we provide a full generalization of LCM for the semantic setting that has been previously used by the Claudien system...|$|R

In this paper, we consider the frequent <b>closed</b> <b>pattern</b> discovery problem for a class of structured data, called attribute trees (AT), which is a subclass of labeled ordered trees and can be also regarded as a fragment of description logic with functional roles only. We present an efficient algorithm for discovering all frequent closed patterns appearing in a given collection of attribute trees. By using a new enumeration method, called the prefix-preserving closure extension, which enable efficient depth-first search over all closed patterns without duplicates, we show that this algorithm works in polynomial time both in the total size of the input database and the number of output trees generated by the algorithm. To our knowledge, this {{is one of the}} first result for output-sensitive algorithms for frequent closed substructure disocvery from trees and graphs...|$|E

40|$|Maximal biclique (also {{known as}} {{complete}} bipartite) subgraphs can model many applications in web mining, business, and bioinformatics. Enumerating maximal biclique subgraphs from a graph is a computationally challenging problem, as {{the size of}} the output can become exponentially large with respect to the vertex number when the graph grows. In this paper, we efficiently enumerate them through the use of <b>closed</b> <b>patterns</b> of the adjacency matrix of the graph. For an undirected graph G without self-loops, we prove that: (i) the number of <b>closed</b> <b>patterns</b> in the adjacency matrix of G is even; (ii) the number of the <b>closed</b> <b>patterns</b> is precisely double the number of maximal biclique subgraphs of G; and (iii) for every maximal biclique subgraph, there always exists a unique pair of <b>closed</b> <b>patterns</b> that matches the two vertex sets of the subgraph. Therefore, the problem of enumerating maximal bicliques can be solved by using efficient algorithms for mining <b>closed</b> <b>patterns,</b> which are algorithms extensively studied in the data mining field. However, this direct use of existing algorithms causes a duplicated enumeration. To achieve high efficiency, we propose an O(mn) time delay algorithm for a non-duplicated enumeration, in particular for enumerating those maximal bicliques with a large size, where m and n are the number of edges and vertices of the graph respectively. We evaluate the high efficiency of our algorithm by comparing it to state-of-the-art algorithms on three categories of graphs: randomly generated graphs, benchmarks, and a real-life protein interaction network. In this paper, we also prove that if self-loops are allowed in a graph, then the number of <b>closed</b> <b>patterns</b> in the adjacency matrix is not necessarily even; but the maximal bicliques are exactly the same as those of the graph after removing all the self-loops...|$|R

The PDA shunt flow was identified from four Doppler patterns, and the <b>closed</b> <b>pattern</b> of a closed duct was also presented. Clinically significant PDA was diagnosed when there was colour Doppler echocardiographic evidence of left to right ductal shunt associated with {{at least two of the}} following clinical signs: heart murmur (systolic or continuous); persistent tachycardia (heart rate> 160 /min); hyperactive precordial pulsation; bounding pulses; and radiographic evidence of cardiomegaly or pulmonary congestion.  RESULTS—Of 68  infants enrolled into this study, clincally significant PDA developed in 31.  The most recordable sequence of transition change of shunt flow pattern for clinically significant PDA was: pulmonary hypertension pattern, to growing pattern, to pulsatile pattern, to closing pattern, to <b>closed</b> <b>pattern.</b> And that for non-clinically significant PDA was: pulmonary hypertension pattern, to closing pattern, to <b>closed</b> <b>pattern.</b> The growing and the pulsatile patterns were mostly documented in infants with clinically significant PDA. The first documented growing pattern to predict clinically significant PDA gave a sensitivity of 64. 5 % and a specificity of 81. 1 %; the first documented pulsatile pattern gave a sensitivity of 93. 5 % and a specificity of 100 %.  CONCLUSION—Doppler echocardiographic assessment of PDA shunt flow pattern during the first 4  days of life is useful for predicting the development of clinically significant PDA in premature infants. At that stage, the closing or closed Doppler pattern indicates that infants are not at risk of developing clinically significant PDA; the growing or pulsatile Doppler pattern indicates a continuing risk of developing clinically significant PDA.    Keywords: Echocardiography; patent ductus arteriosus; Doppler flow patter...|$|E
