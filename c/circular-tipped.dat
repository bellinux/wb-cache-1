40|$|The {{pressure}} distribution data {{discussed in}} this report represents the results of part of an investigation conducted on the factors affecting the aerodynamic safety of airplanes. The present tests were made on semispan, <b>circular-tipped</b> Clark Y airfoil models mounted in the conventional manner on a separation plane. Pressure readings were made simultaneously at all test orifices at each of 20 angles of attack between - 8 degrees and + 90 degrees. The results of the tests on each wing arrangement are compared on the bases of maximum normal force coefficient, lateral stability {{at a low rate}} of roll, and relative longitudinal stability. Tabular data are also presented giving the center of pressure location of each wing...|$|E
