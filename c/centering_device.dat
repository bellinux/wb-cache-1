50|$|The {{object with}} an {{articulated}} locomotive is to distribute traction power over {{a larger number}} of driving wheels with a flexible wheelbase. On the Mallet type, the boiler was fixed to the frame of the rear engine unit, as on a regular steam locomotive. The front engine unit carried the boiler barrel by means of a large supporting bracket, attached to the underside of the barrel and carried on a slide, fixed to the front engine unit's frame. On curves, the front engine unit could move several inches laterally under the boiler barrel. Side control springs acted as a <b>centering</b> <b>device</b> for the engine unit.|$|E
50|$|Double Cardan joints {{are similar}} to double Cardan shafts, except that {{the length of the}} {{intermediate}} shaft is shortened leaving only the yokes; this effectively allows the two Hooke's joints to be mounted back to back. DCJs are typically used in steering columns, as they eliminate the need to correctly phase the universal joints at the ends of the intermediate shaft (IS), which eases packaging of the IS around the other components in the engine bay of the car. They are also used to replace Rzeppa style constant-velocity joints in applications where high articulation angles, or impulsive torque loads are common, such as the driveshafts and halfshafts of rugged four wheel drive vehicles. Double Cardan joints require a centering element that will maintain equal angles between the driven and driving shafts for true constant velocity rotation. This <b>centering</b> <b>device</b> requires additional torque to accelerate the internals of the joint and does generate some additional vibration at higher speeds.|$|E

5000|$|Trailing wheels first {{appeared}} on American locomotives between 1890 and 1895, but their axle worked in rigid pedestals. It enabled boilers to be lowered, since {{the top of the}} main frames was dropped down behind the driving wheels and under the firebox. The firebox could also be longer and wider, increasing the heating surface area and steam generation capacity of the boiler, and therefore its power. The concept was soon improved to provide radial lateral movement by placing the pair of trailing wheels and their axle in a fabricated sub-frame or truck, usually with outside bearings as they gave the best lateral riding stability. One-piece cast-steel trailer trucks were developed about 1915, to provide the additional strength for a booster engine to be fitted to the trailing axle. Finally, about 1921 the Delta trailing truck was developed with an inverted-rocker <b>centering</b> <b>device</b> at the rear ends of the truck frame. Delta trucks were soon enlarged to carry four trailing wheels, and later six.|$|E
50|$|Racing wheels {{started off}} as simple plastic wheels {{hooked up to}} a rotary potentiometer, which were sprung by springs or bungees. Eventually {{manufacturers}} began to use electric motors in the controllers, in place of springs, in order to achieve a level of force feedback, first seen in Microsoft's Sidewinder wheel. At first this technology simply provided the centering force and other artificial effects such as shaking the wheel in a crash or other vibrations. However, as driving simulations have evolved, their physics engines have become more accurate and the developers have linked their in-game physics more closely to the force feedback. This allows the user to truly feel what forces go through the steering rack, instead of just artificial effects, and genuinely enhance the realism of the game. Despite this, some high end manufacturers believe that force feedback has still not been perfected, and therefore companies such as Thomas SuperWheel have not adopted a force feedback system in their products. Frex, on the other hand, has gone the other way and equips their high-end Simwheel with powerful force feedback and no mechanical <b>centering</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

The wire for pin 34 is attached normally on the other types and is not grounded. Installing the cable backwards (with the black connector on the system board, the blue connector on the remote device and the gray connector on the <b>center</b> <b>device)</b> will ground pin 34 of the remote device and connect host pin 34 through to pin 34 of the <b>center</b> <b>device.</b> The gray <b>center</b> connector omits the connection to pin 28 but connects pin 34 normally, while the black end connector connects both pins 28 and 34 normally.|$|R

40|$|Statement of Problem: Mediolateral {{orientation}} (centralization) of the earpiece face-bow is {{a difficult}} skill to master when a student’s experience is minimal. Purpose: Assessment of centering reliability of an earpiece face-bow incorporating a new <b>centering</b> <b>device</b> called median sagittal plane indicator (MSPI) compared to the conventional one. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 30 subjects. For each subject, two ear-bow transfers were applied, the first utilized the conventional Hanau 159 - 4 earpiece face-bow and the second used the same earpiece face-bow modified with the MSPI as an anterior reference point to ensure mediolateral centralization. Results: This investigation demonstrated {{a statistically significant difference}} between the two methods, where the modified method was superior to the conventional one regarding the number of trials used to achieve centralization of the earpiece transfer. Conclusion: Introduction of MSPI which could be used with most commercial facebows appears to be a reliable clinical procedure concerning accuracy in the determination of mediolateral location, and hence centralization particularly for less experienced practitioners, for instance dental studentsKing Saud Universit...|$|E

40|$|Hybrid microproducts {{are very}} {{important}} in every application where small dimension and light weigh are fundamental. They are used in different fields, such as the automotive, the aeronautic/aerospace, the automation, the medical and biomedical field, the watch industry, {{but also in the}} sport and entertainment sectors. These microproducts differ from MOEMS because they consist of several components with some features of few hundreds microns made of different materials. The final product is obtained by the assembly of the various components and this gives hybrid microproducts a high 3 D aspect and better mechanical performance than MOEMS. The main problem that limits the market diffusion of these products is the enormous assembly cost that represents up to the 80 % of their final cost. This is due to their manual assembly that is a time consuming activity. Actually, traditional assembly systems are not suitable because when dimensions of objects are less than 1 mm, many problems arise: surface forces become bigger than gravity, there are difficulties due to the vision and force control, objects can be fragile, tolerances become very narrow, there is not a systematic design for microassembly, methods and models are not developed enough in microdomain. Different approaches can be found in literature as an alternative to manual assembly to reduce costs. One of the most promising strategies is the assembly microfactory. It is a miniaturization of an assembly system with the aims of improving precision and reducing the ratio, in terms of energy, material and space consumption, between the assembly facilities and the microproducts obtained. Therefore, many assembly and control devices have to work in a very little area with low energy consumption and high precision. Nowadays, one of the main problems that makes difficult the development of these microfactories is the lack of handling devices able to manipulate components that have dimension of few hundreds microns. The required handling devices are microfeeders to transport, orient and position microparts, microsorters to arrange components, microgrippers to grasp and release them, micromanipulators and microrobots to support microgrippers. In the PhD research activity various innovative handling devices for manipulating parts of different materials and shapes have been designed, developed and tested. These systems are able to solve some critical issues in the automatic handling of objects with dimensions of few hundreds microns such as feeding and transporting, grasping and releasing, positioning. The developed systems are an electrostatic <b>centering</b> <b>device</b> and an electrostatic sorter, some mechanical and adhesive grippers and a 2 DOF microrobot. The two electrostatic devices make use of electrostatic force to transport and position microparts (the <b>centering</b> <b>device)</b> and to sort and arrange a group of objects randomly positioned (the sorter system). Two kinds of gripper have been designed: the mechanical (piezo actuated) and the adhesive gripper. The first kind uses a piezoelectric actuator to close and open the fingers, the second exploits capillary forces to grasp and center microobjects. Finally, the 2 DOF manipulator is an electromagnetic device able to support light grippers as electrostatic and adhesive ones. These devices have been integrated in the assembly microfactory in progress at the Department of Mechanical, Nuclear and Production Engineering of the University of Pisa within the Italian research PRIN project “Development of innovative technologies for the assembly of hybrid microproducts”. In this microfactory, the assembly strategy makes use of a carrier that contains the components of the products to be assembled and moves from an assembly station to the next one. This assembly system is confined in a controlled environment and consists, at the moment, of an assembly station equipped with various grippers (on the basis of the assembly tasks to be carried out) and controlled by vision systems...|$|E

Design details Centi. ijiugal basket In the recent past, centrifugal basket volumes have been continuously increasing due to market requirements, resulting in volumes of 2, 200 kg per charge and even more. In general {{it can be said that}} in the purging of even sized crystals for both white and raw sugar a gravity factor of approximately l 000 to 1 - l 00 is sufficient. The layer thickness in the basket should not exceed 230 mm, especially for fine sugar having a crystal size of approximately 0, 4 mm, since the smaller gaps between such crystals provide more resistance to molasses drainage. The baskets described here are exclusively in stainless steel. A higher charge volume of the centrifugal basket (Figure 1) can be achieved by increasing: the height H of the basket andor the diameter D of the basket andlor the thickness of the crystal layer HK...|$|E
