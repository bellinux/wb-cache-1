A fourfold increase in combined residual chlorine was required to achieve the same degree of inactivation for occluded virus as for free or secondarily adsorbed virus. A <b>combined</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> of 6. 6 mg/liter was necessary to achieve 50 % inactivation in 15 min at pH 8. 0 and 22 degrees C in a particulate suspension containing occluded virus compared to 1. 4 mg/liter for free virus. These differences were found to be relatively small compared to differences due to the presence of dissolved organics or between free and combined chlorine residuals.

40|$|Three {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of chloramines in water were compared using pH-buffered nanopure water and natural organic matter (NOM) solutions. We investigated whether the N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) colorimetric method and/or an adapted indophenol method (Hach MonochlorF) are suitable for determining the concentration of monochloramine in drinking water. Membrane introduction mass spectrometry (MIMS) {{was used as a}} reference analysis method to determine the different chloramine species in water. All methods measured monochloramine accurately in Nanopure water, but the DPD colorimetric method measured higher residuals (inorganic and organic chloramines) than MonochlorF or MIMS when in the presence of NOM due to organic chloramines. The indophenol method (MonochlorF) accurately detected only monochloramine and not other chloramine forms. Overall, the monochloramine concentration measured by MonochlorF was comparable with the MIMS results. A <b>combined</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> approach by the DPD colorimetric method does not differentiate between monochloramine and organic chloramines. Therefore, DPD colorimetric methods can overestimate disinfection efficacy in chloraminated water systems because of interference from organic chloramines that have no or poor bactericidal ability. Compared with the DPD colorimetric method, MonochlorF is a better choice for chloraminated water systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Haloacetic acids (HAAs), {{which are}} formed during the {{disinfection}} of drinking waters with chlorine, are {{regulated by the}} US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Stage 1 Disinfectant/Disinfection Byproducts (D/DBP) Rule. Recently, three studies have been reported indicating that low concentrations of HAAs can also be formed during disinfection with chloramines. Methods currently approved for compliance monitoring under the Stage 1 Rule arrest the chlorine-mediated formation of HAAs by adding ammonium chloride, which forms chloramines. Studies were undertaken using an in-process water that favored the formation of HAAs with moderate total organic carbon concentration {{and high levels of}} chlorine to investigate the potential formation of HAAs under sample storage conditions. The ammonium chloride-quenched sample did form a small amount of HAAs, but total formation over a period equal to the 14 -day sample storage time was less than 2 µg/l, whereas the unquenched samples increased 41 mg/l during the same period. Pour plate studies indicated that chlorinated drinking waters quenched with ammonium chloride are protected from microbial growth, which is an important additional advantage to this preservation scheme. The presence of a <b>combined</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> should prevent microbial degradation of HAAs in samples.

The goal {{was to determine if}} a significant decrease in DBP formation could be achieved. The final Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection By-Products (DDBP) Rule has prompted A WC to investigate strategies that can help decrease DBP formation in their finished and distributed water.

40|$|A coordinated {{research}} {{effort was}} undertaken {{to investigate the}} impact of secondary-treated effluents from the Wahiawa and Whitmore Sewage Treatment Plants on the Wahiawa Reservoir and to evaluate alternatives to the present mode of effluent disposal. The research for the Department of Public Works, City and County of Honolulu, consisted of studies of the historical and institutional background of the reservoir, water and sediment quality, algal growth potential, fish toxicity of the secondary effluent, and reservoir and waste water management alternatives. Evaluation of the water quality data indicates {{a high level of}} nitrogen and phosphorus in the Wahiawa Reservoir waters as compared to upstream control points, such as the Ku Tree Reservoir. Sediment quality indicates a definite eutrophic condition downstream of the treatment plant discharges. Algal growth studies show that nitrogen may be the limiting growth factor for near-surface waters and phosphorus for deeper waters downstream of the treatment plant discharges and that phosphorus may be limiting upstream from those points. As expected, highest growth potential occurred with the sewage effluent or at the points of its discharge into the reservoir. The fish bioassays resulted in a 96 -hr TLm at about 0. 24 to 0. 47 mg/l <b>combined</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> in continuous flow studies for tilapia, 0. 28 mg/l for mosquito fish, and 0. 05 mg/l for mollies. A number of management alternatives were evaluated and the most feasible of these alternatives appears to be secondary effluent reuse for sugarcane irrigation or tertiary waste water treatment. Although these warrant further detailed evaluation, both as to system design, costs and institutional constraints, preliminary estimates of costs and benefits derived favor the tertiary treatment alternative. The recommendation for management of the Wahiawa and Whitmore Village Sewage Treatment Plant effluents is the application of tertiary treatment, particularly for phosphorus removal. This level of treatment should only be necessary during the low flow period of the year, and the dilution and assimilation capacity of the reservoir waters can be utilized at higher reservoir water levels with the present secondary level of treatment. It is emphasized that the decision to implement tertiary treatment should not be a unilateral one, but should be made in consultation with all agencies involved in management and control of use of the reservoir waters so that the final management scheme is {{in the best interests of}} all.

Les résultats obtenus montrent que la cinétique de désinfection est loin d'être uniforme. L'utilisation du modèle de Chick et Watson n'est en effet {{possible}} que si on l'adapte pour tenir compte de la modification de la vitesse de désinfection au cours du processus. Le modèle de Collins et Selleck {{permet de}} rendre compte de façon satisfaisante de l'évolution de la vitesse d'élimination des germes au cours du temps. La faible valeur du paramètre t trouvée (0. 26 min. mg/l pour les coliformes totaux et 0. 58 min. mg/l pour les coliformes fécaux) semble cependant démontrer que la période de latence est relativement peut importante surtout lorsqu'on utilise des dose de chlore élevées. Il s'avère d'autre part que la demande en chlore de ce type d'eau est très importante. La concentration en chlore résiduel dans le réacteur décroît très rapidement pour atteindre environs 10 % de la dose de chlore injectée et cela quelle que soit la dose utilisée (de 1 à 10 mg/l). Le dimensionnement des réacteurs de désinfection fonctionnant en continu nécessite de prendre en compte le comportement hydrodynamique de l'eau dans le réacteur. Sachant qu'un abattement de 3 U-Log est nécessaire, dans le cas de la réutilisation de l'eau pour l'irrigation, un modèle intégrant l'expression de la cinétique de désinfection et l'hydrodynamique du contacteur a été proposé. Les résultats mettent en évidence l'intérêt de concevoir des réacteurs se rapprochant le plus possible de l'écoulement piston. Secondary wastewater is considered {{as an important}} additional resource of water in a country, which has a semiarid climate as Tunisia. On quality basis, the use of water for irrigation is governed by chemical parameters of the water that affect plant, soils conditions and the underlying groundwater. Treated urban wastewater is susceptible {{to be used in}} irrigation without major risks (see table 1). However, the use of such a water can represent a risk of contamination of edible crops, pasture lands, and feed crops by direct contact with disease agent carried in reclaimed water or aerosols from spray irrigation. These sanitary risks can be considerably reduced with the practice of an efficient disinfection. Chlorinating is one of the simplest and less expensive disinfection processes. The objectives of this work are the study of the disinfection kinetics and the rate of exertion of chlorine demand of water, when the sodium hypochlorite is used for treating a secondary wastewater. for this, a batch reactor tests have been done. After applying a dose of chlorine (between 1 and 10 mg/l), we have determined the evolution with time of chlorine residual concentration and rate of inactivation of the total and fecal coliform. Chlorine demandTo describe chlorine decay in the complex milieu of water, like wastewater, Haas and Karra (1984) have developed followed equation:C=C 0 [XE-k 1 t+(1 -X) e]-k 2 twhere:C : concentration of residual chlorine, mg/lC 0  : dose of chlorine, mg/lX : empirical constantt : contact time, mink 1 and k 2  : rate constants, min- 1 In the case of wastewater chlorinating, we can ascertain that the chlorine concentration in the batch reactor decrease rapidly, {{in the beginning of the}} reaction, and very moderately after satisfaction of the initial chlorine demand. This initial chlorine demand is very important. It represents near 90 % of the dose injected in the reactor. The chlorine concentration decay can be described by Haas and Karra equation with X= 0. 9, k 1 = 3 min- 1 and k 2 = 0. 001 min- 1. After some minutes of contact time, we can notes, see figure 2, that the chlorine concentration decay is susceptible to be approximate by a first order equation:t ≥ 2 min ⇒ C ≅ 0. 1 e- 0. 001 tThe concentration of residual chlorine becomes practically constant in the reactor, once initial chlorine demand has been satisfied, with C ≅ 0. 1 C 0. Disinfection kineticsUsing a pseudo first order Chick and Watson model reveals that the rate of inactivation of coliform bacteria is not uniform. We can employ this model to fit experimental data only when we subdivide the process in two stages characterised by different kinetics. for example, the logarithm of fecal coliform survival rate can be expressed by the relationships:for C ∙ t ≤ 2. 85 min ∙ mg/L Ln(N/N 0) = - 1. 65 C ∙ tfor C ∙ t ≥ 2. 85 min ∙ mg/L Ln(N/N 0) = - 3. 89 - 0. 29 C⋄tCollins and Selleck (1972) developed a general kinetic expression for the effect of <b>combined</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> on both total and fecal coliform. Combining the work of chick and Gard (Gard, 1957) they developed the following formula describing the survival of these bacteria:for C∙t τ (N/N 0) =(τ/C∙t) nwhere C : the <b>combined</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual,</b> mg/lt : contact time, minutet : an environmental coefficient or induction timen : Constant In this formula, we have assumed that the concentration of chlorine remains constant. We can apply this model when we consider that C is the chlorine concentration after the immediate wastewater demand had been satisfied. Using Collins and Selleck disinfection model to plot the survival rate of total and fecal coliform in chlorinated secondary effluent, we have obtained the coefficients below: for total coliform : n= 1. 94 t= 0. 26 min∙mg/lfor fecal coliform : n= 3. 1 t= 0. 58 min∙mg/lThe constant τ represents the time required for the disinfectant to diffuse through the cell wall and begin its disinfectant activity. we can see that this initial lag time is very short. The disinfectant becomes rapidly efficacious to inactivate coliform bacteria. Design of disinfectant contact facilitiesSo as to estimate the influence of the hydraulic efficiency of chlorine contact chambers on disinfection process performance, we have compared efficiency of two ideals reactors: the completely stirred tank reactor and plug flow reactor. The kinetic equations presented above had been established in a batch reactor. To obtain the mean conversion in the entire contactor, one has to apply the segregated flow model. Using the concept of segregated flow system, the survival ratio will be the sum of the batch reactions of all small aggregates, or:           ∞(N/N 0) =∫(N/N 0) batchE(Ɵ) dƟ            0 Ɵ : normalized contact time (contact time/hydraulic residence time) E(Ɵ)  : normalized frequency distribution of agesIn completely mixed regime, fluid particles are exponentially distributed throughout a tank until the fluid properties exhibited by the effluent leaving the unit are identical to those within the unit. Using Collins and Selleck model, the survival ratio corresponding to hydraulic residence time Ts and to the residual chlorine concentration C is expressed by equation:           ∞                      (τ/C∙Ts)            ∞(N/N 0) =∫(N/N 0) batche-ƟdƟ = ∫ e-ƟdƟ + ∫ (τ/C∙t) me-ƟdƟ            0                              0          (τ/C∙Ts) The survival ratio for a hydraulic residence times between 5 min and 60 min and a residual chlorine concentration between 0. 2 mg/l and 1 mg/l are reported in table 3 and table 4. In a plug flow regime all particles entering in a basin have equal velocity values, travel on parallel flow paths, and remain in the unit for an identical period known as the hydraulic residence time. the performance of such a reactor is identical at the batch reactor performance. In table 5 and table 6 we have reported the survival ratio given by plug flow reactor with residence time until 60 min and residual chlorine concentration between 0. 2 mg/l and 1 mg/l. Knowing that the secondary wastewater reuse necessitates a 3 U-Log fecal coliform inactivation, we can see clearly the importance of reactor design on his performance. Indeed, to reach a 3 U-log inactivation, it is sufficient (see table 6) to use a dose of 2 mg/l of chlorine and a hydraulic residence time of 30 minutes, in plug flow reactor. Such dose and the same residence time given only a 1 U -Log inactivation (see table 4) when the reactor is completely mixed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: Toowoomba Regional Council (TRC) {{maintains}} a distribution {{network in the}} city of Toowoomba that provides drinking quality water to over 90, 000 people. The quality of water throughout this network must be maintained to high standards according to TRC’s water guidelines. Adhering to these guidelines minimises the risk of harmful waterborne pathogens and microbial contamination within the water distribution network. Water quality monitoring is an everyday task of the TRC ground staff. Manual tests at set locations within each pressure zone are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that water quality is at an adequate standard. TRC have identified that the testing data obtained from these manual tests only give an indication of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> levels at one location at one point in time. The only feasible method to analyse <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> throughout an entire network is to construct a hydraulic model which enables <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> to be modelled at every point within the distribution system at all times of the day. The {{purpose of this study was}} to construct a hydraulic model that was able to identify low and high <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> levels within the Platz pressure zone and the Trunk mains system based on the hydraulic behaviour of both areas. Options to rectify the problem areas that were identified were recommended to keep <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> levels within the guidelines specified by TRC. “Pipes++”, developed by Watercom Pty.

Due to the new requirements that fall under the pmposed S 2 DDBPR, an initial distribution system evaluation (IDSE) on the Stamford WDS is required to locate potential monitoring sites for compliance with DSP regulations. Between July 2002 and August 2003, three field study events (summer 2002, winter 2003, and sunnner 2003) were conducted on the Stamford WDS to calculate water age at different locations, as well as pmvide a better understanding of water quality (WQ) including temporal and spatial variations in DBP concentrations in the Stamford WDS. A computer model of the Stamford WDS was created by Haestad Methods. The field data and operational data supplied to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst allowed for the verification and application of this model. The model predictions of tracer concentrations and <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> were similar to a majority of the field results from the three sampling events. Water demands during the three sampling events were calculated from operational data supplied by the AWC and used as the water demands in the model.

Field measured free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> were modeled by applying the free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> measured in the SWTP clearwell effluent, and a calculated first order bulk water decay rate based upon field measurements. The model predictions of tracer concentrations and <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> were compared to field measurements of fluoride concentrations and free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> at locations in the Stamford WDS.

40|$|Abstract {{approved}} (Major professor) For decades, the {{sanitary engineer}} has used chlorine as the fi nal, {{and in some}} cases the only, treatment of a potable water to pre vent the spread of water-borne diseases. In addition, he also has used coliform organisms as an indicator of the bacteriological quali ty of the chlorinated water he has produced. Yet never, in all these years of water treatment practices, has there been reported a study of the correlation of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> found in the water of the distribution systems with the bacteriological quality of the water based on the coliform indicator organisms. In this study, data were collected from seven cities throughout the country. In addition to the results of the coliform tests, the data included the results of total <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> determinations made at the time bacteriological samples were taken. A frequency distribu tion showing the percent of positive coliform tubes versus the total Redacted for privacy <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> was made and an equation fitted to this distribution by means of a least squares analysis. The results of the analyses show conclusively that a mathemat ically definable relationship does exist between <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> and coliform density in water distribution systems. It is also shown that regardless of the <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> maintained in a water distribu tion system, at least 0. 45 percent of all coliform tubes examined will show a positive presence of these organisms. This is attributed to the positive nature of the errors involved in the sampling and analyti cal procedures used in the coliform test...|$|R

In the current study, we investigate the inactivation of Ebola virus in sterilized domestic wastewater utilizing sodium hypochlorite addition and pH adjustment. No viral inactivation was observed in the one-hour tests without sodium hypochlorite addition or pH adjustment. No virus was recovered after 20 seconds (i. e. 4. 2 log 10 unit inactivation to detection limit) following the addition of 5 and 10 mg L- 1 sodium hypochlorite, which resulted in immediate free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> of 0. 52 and 1. 11 mg L- 1, respectively. The addition of 1 mg L- 1 sodium hypochlorite resulted in an immediate free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> of 0. 16 mg L- 1, which inactivated 3. 5 log 10 units of Ebola virus in 20 seconds. Further inactivation was not evident due to the rapid consumption of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual.</b> Elevating the pH to 11. 2 was found to significantly increase viral decay over ambient conditions. These results indicate the high susceptibility of the enveloped Ebola virus to disinfection in the presence of free chlorine in municipal wastewater; however, we caution that extension to more complex matrices (e. g. bodily fluids) will require additional verification...|$|R

A field study {{conducted at the}} Wahiawa Wastewater Treatment Plant {{on the island of}} Oahu, Hawaii was established to determine the effect of aeration on disinfection efficiency in the chlorine contact chamber. A range of chlorine dosages was applied to the waste water entering the contact chamber for aeration rates of 0, 2. 36 x 10 ^(- 3), and 4. 72 x 10 ^(- 3) std. m^ 3 /s (0, 5, and 10 std. cfm) of air. The chlorine demand and chlorine requirement of the waste water was then determined by measuring the <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> and fecal coliform concentration in the effluent leaving the chlorine contact chamber. The addition of aeration into the chlorine contact chamber enhanced the disinfection efficiency of chlorine, while its effect on <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> loss in the contact chamber was not readily apparent; however, a greater drop in the <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> was observed for higher chlorine dosages during periods of aeration, in comparison to nonaerated conditions.

In {{spite of the}} high chlorine dose at the treatment plant (~ 6 mg/l), the <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> is virtually zero {{at the end of}} the pipe. By understanding the chlorine decay kinetics in this pipe and the parameters influencing this decay, a model forecasting the free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> will be developed. It will provide the basis for developing feedback systems that can be used to adjust chlorine dosing levels at the treatment plant in response to residual levels at the extremities of the distribution system. The research involves laboratory measurements as well as a field study. The laboratory measurements are undertaken in order to select the most appropriate chlorine decay kinetic model and to understand the parameters involved in this decay. Of particular interest are the four fractions of natural organic matter (NOM) extracted using ionexchange resins. The field study involves chlorine and flow monitoring by on-line sensors along the pipe. Instead of using sparse data collected along the pipe, this extended period of monitored data will enable a good calibration of the computer model.

Multiple disinfectants can be utilized to optimize a good water quality program. The goal of these water disinfectants is to greatly reduce or eliminate the presence of all bacteria. In recent years, the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) meter has been a tool utilized by the poultry industry to monitor chlorine efficacy in drinking water. An ORP reading of 650 - 750 millivolts (mV) has become the industry standard for assuring an acceptable sanitizing <b>residual</b> of free <b>chlorine</b> is present for controlling microbial contamination regardless of the actual amount of total or free chlorine or the water pH. A recent bench top evaluation of a new chlorine product revealed microbial contamination even when the oxidation-reduction potential read 650 mV. Given these results, it is beneficial for the poultry industry to re-evaluate the relationship between total <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual,</b> free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual,</b> ORP value, and microbial levels. Additionally, the study determined if a new ORP standard should be the target and if this standard consistently correlates to free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> (ppm) even under scenarios of different water quality parameters. This study evaluated the efficacy of two different forms of chlorine, a liquid product (sodium hypochlorite) and a crystalline dry product (sodium dichloro-S-triazinetrione) at three concentrations (2, 4, and 8 oz/gal) commonly used for drinking water sanitation in the poultry industry. The objective {{was to determine the}} relationship between total and free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual,</b> ORP, pH, and microbial content of the water when the chlorine products are utilized in water with a high microbial level typically found in unclean poultry drinking water lines. Results indicated both forms of chlorine were effective disinfectants for reducing aerobic bacteria present in the water. Additionally, the results of this experiment showed under field conditions where microbiologically challenged water is present, an ORP reading of 700 mV is required to achieve an efficient microbial reduction/elimination and this is supported by at least 3 ppm of free chlorine...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2012 International Journal of Civil EngineeringCompared to {{conventional}} chlorination methods which apply chlorine at water treatment plant, booster chlorination has almost solved {{the problems of}} high dosages of <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> near water sources and lack of <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> in the remote points of a water distribution system (WDS). However, control of trihalomethane (THM) formation as a potentially carcinogenic disinfection by-product (DBP) within a WDS has still remained as a water quality problem. This paper presents a two-phase approach of multi-objective booster disinfection in which both <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> and THM formation are concurrently optimized in a WDS. In the first phase, a booster disinfection system is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem in which the location of booster stations is determined. The objectives are defined as to maximize the volumetric discharge with appropriate levels of disinfectant residuals throughout all demand nodes and to minimize the total mass of disinfectant applied with a specified number of booster stations. The most frequently selected locations for installing booster disinfection stations are selected for the second phase, in which another two-objective optimization problem is defined. The objectives in the second problem are to minimize the volumetric discharge avoiding THM maximum levels and to maximize the volumetric discharge with standard levels of disinfectant residuals. For each point on the resulted trade-off curve between the water quality objectives optimal scheduling of chlorination injected at each booster station is obtained. Both optimization problems used NSGA-II algorithm as a multi-objective genetic algorithm, coupled with EPANET as a hydraulic simulation model. The optimization problems are tested for different numbers of booster chlorination stations in a real case WDS. As a result, this type of multi-objective optimization model can explicitly give the decision makers the optimal location and scheduling of booster disinfection systems {{with respect to the}} trade-off between maximum safe drinking water with allowable <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> levels and minimum adverse DBP levels...|$|R

Further, taste sensitivity may be different for populations never exposed to chlorinated water. Here, household chlorination trials in Bangladesh similarly revealed dissatisfaction with treated water due to taste and odour, although attempts to quantify chlorine sensitivity disputed the dissatisfaction at lower residuals. A granular activated carbon (GAC) filter fitted to the spigot of a covered tank removed the remaining <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> prior to drinking and increased user satisfaction.

The most basic of these compounds is molecular chlorine (Cl2); however, its application is primarily in large commercial public swimming pools. Inorganic forms of chlorine-releasing compounds frequently used in residential and public swimming pools include sodium hypochlorite commonly known as liquid bleach or simply bleach, calcium hypochlorite and lithium hypochlorite. <b>Chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> from Cl2 and inorganic chlorine-releasing compounds break down rapidly in sunlight. To extend their disinfectant usefulness and persistence in outdoor settings, swimming pools treated with {{one or more of the}} inorganic forms of chlorine-releasing compounds can be supplemented with cyanuric acid—a granular stabilizing agent capable of extending the active <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> half-life (t½) by four to sixfold.

Microbiological quality was assessed from densities of total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, total colony counts, and {{the presence or absence}} of amoebae, including the pathogen Naegleria fowleri. Although a free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> of 1. 0 mg/liter and a pH range of 7. 0 to 7. 6 are recommended by local health authorities, 41 pools had a lower free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> and 37 had a pH outside this range. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to test the association of field measurements with the microbiological data. The analysis demonstrated a strong positive association of free chlorine with bacteriological quality and the absence of Naegleria spp. No other field measurement was predictive in this regard, although the absence of all amoebae was associated with a relatively low water temperature and pH. Using a mathematical model derived from this analysis, it was estimated that 99 % of pools would have acceptable bacteriological quality and 94 % would be free of Naegleria spp. at a free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> of 1. 0 mg/liter.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. The studied scopes consisted of groundwater (60 wells), reservoirs (10 tanks), and water distribution network (33 points). One sample was taken from each source monthly. Statistical tests used included post hoc tests (Tukey HSD). Finally, the results were compared with drinking water standards. Results: The average concentrations of iron in groundwater, reservoirs, and distribution networks were 0. 09, 0. 07, and 0. 07 mg/l, respectively. The average concentrations of manganese in groundwater, reservoirs, and distribution networks were 0. 15, 0. 09, and 0. 1 mg/l, respectively. The turbidity averages in groundwater, reservoirs, and distribution networks were 0. 58, 0. 6, and 0. 52 NTU, respectively. The average concentrations of free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> in water reservoirs and distribution networks were 1. 74 and 1. 06 mg/l, respectively. The pH averages in groundwater, reservoirs, and distribution networks were 7. 4, 7. 7, and 7. 5, respectively. The amounts of iron, manganese, turbidity, free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual,</b> and pH in the investigated resources had no significant differences (P > 0. 05). Conclusion: The amounts of iron, manganese, turbidity, free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> and pH in groundwater, reservoirs, and water distribution networks of Qom are within permissible limits of national standards and EPA guidelines.

40|$|Disinfection is an {{important}} process in the treatment and supply of potable water, as it protects public health {{from the threat of}} waterborne diseases. The use of chlorine for disinfection is widespread due to the cost-effectiveness and simplicity of the chlorination process and the persistence of a free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> within the water distribution system (WDS). Maintenance of a <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> is a commonly adopted strategy for secondary disinfection of potable water supplies, however effective maintenance of a residual is often often hampered by a lack of a suitable control system for regulating chlorine doses. In order to develop appropriate dosing strategies, it is first necessary to be able to describe the behaviour of <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> within the WDS. Traditionally, dynamic water quality modelling has involved coupling of water quality models to calibrated hydraulic models. Such models are useful for the design and analysis of a WDS, however they are expensive to construct and include assumptions regarding the complex processes that affect the decay of chlorine within the WDS. In contrast, a control-oriented approach aims to describe the dynamic input-output behaviour between an applied chlorine dose and the residual measured downstream at a strategic point within the WDS. Empirical modelling techniques are extremely useful for developing input-output models {{in the absence of a}} calibrated hydraulic model of the WDS, and without a great deal of a priori knowledge of chlorine decay processes. Recently, an empirical WDS modelling methodology based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been shown to produce models that accurately describe the non-linear inputoutput behaviour of <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals.</b> This robust type of model has tremendous potential for implementation in intelligent adaptive control schemes. In this paper, the development of a control-oriented model is described for a single case study. The type of ANN model selected for this study was the general regression neural network (GRNN). The methodology applied to model development aims to ensure that the final model performs well and is therefore considered more rigorous than typical GRNN development methodologies. A comparison is made to a linear auto-regressive movingaverage (ARMA) model that is often proposed for control-oriented modelling. The GRNN was found to perform particularly well in this application (r² ~ 0. 98) and this was far better than the ARMA model (r² ~ 0. 85). This result indicates that the ANN approach to controloriented modelling has increased potential for use in the development of robust control systems for the regulation of <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> within a WDS. Such a control system will provide the benefits of process optimisation and cost reduction and improved water quality for customers...|$|R
