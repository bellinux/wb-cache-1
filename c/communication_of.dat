Chovanec didn't repeat his sentiment regarding the number of gun license holders, and instead specified that one of the issues to be analyzed will be the issuing and revocation of licenses under the existing legislation.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the attacks, many governments across the world passed {{legislation}} to combat terrorism. In Germany, where several of the 9/11 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that country's liberal asylum policies, two major anti-terrorism packages were enacted. The first removed legal loopholes that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in Germany. The second addressed the effectiveness and <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> intelligence and law enforcement. Canada passed the Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act, that nation's first anti-terrorism law. The United Kingdom passed the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. New Zealand enacted the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002.|$|E

This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human {{language is}} also considered unique.|$|E

40|$|The <b>communication</b> {{patterns}} <b>of</b> engineers {{has been}} well researched over the past decades. However, due to the rise <b>of</b> new <b>communication</b> technologies and their speed of inception within society, {{it can be argued}} that this research could be less relevant to modern <b>communication</b> patterns <b>of</b> engineers. In addition, the engineers may have a preference on the communication technology used depending on the subject or purpose <b>of</b> the <b>communication.</b> Therefore, this paper discusses the results from an exploratory study that has investigated the <b>communication</b> patterns <b>of</b> engineers within an SME in 2012. The instances <b>of</b> <b>communication,</b> subject <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> and the purpose <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> were <b>of</b> particular focus.

5|$|The {{cultural}} historian Jeremy Black {{points out}} that From Russia, with Love was written and published {{at a time when}} tensions between East and West were on the rise and public awareness of the Cold War was high. A joint British and American operation to tap into landline <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin using a tunnel into the Soviet-occupied zone had been publicly uncovered by the Soviets in April 1956. The same month the diver Lionel Crabb had gone missing on a mission to photograph the propeller of the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze while the ship was moored in Portsmouth Harbour, an incident that was much reported and discussed in British newspapers. In October and November that year a popular uprising in Hungary was repressed by Soviet forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm had}} several {{long-term}} consequences. Complaints against the USDA Weather Bureau of alleged unpreparedness resulted in increased efforts to achieve more accurate weather forecasting and faster realization and <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> proper storm warnings. Criticism of the shipping companies and shipbuilders {{led to a}} series of conferences with insurers and mariners to seek safer designs for vessels. This resulted in the construction of ships with greater stability and more longitudinal strength. Immediately following the blizzard of Cleveland, Ohio, the city began a campaign to move all utility cables underground, in tubes beneath major streets. The project took half a decade.|$|E

5|$|In English law, secret trusts are a {{class of}} trust defined as an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee, made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a formal will. The property {{is given to the}} trustee in the will, and he would then be expected to pass it on to the real beneficiary. For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the trust must prove that the testator intended to form a trust, that this intention was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his office. There are two types of secret trust — fully secret and half-secret. A fully secret trust is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. In the case of a half-secret trust, the face of the will names the trustee as trustee, but does not give the trust's terms, including the beneficiary. The most important difference lies in <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> the trust: the terms of a half-secret trust must be communicated to the trustee before the execution of the will, whereas {{in the case of a}} fully secret trust the terms may be communicated after the execution of the will, as long as this is before the testator's death.|$|E
