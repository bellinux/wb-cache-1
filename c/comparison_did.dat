Eventually this volcanism model was overturned, as numerous Earth craters (demonstrated by e. g., shatter cones, shocked quartz and other impactites, and possibly spall) were found, after having been eroded over geologic time. Craters formed by larger and larger ordnance also served as models. The Moon, on the other hand, shows no atmosphere or hydrosphere, and could thus accumulate and preserve impact craters over billions of years despite a low impact rate at any one time.

Thwaites and Dagnan, in [...] "Moderating variables {{in the relationship between}} social comparison and depression", investigated the relationship between social comparison and depression utilizing an evolutionary framework. Their hypothesis was that depression was an outcome from social comparisons that people carried out. This study investigated the moderating effects on social comparison of the importance of comparison dimensions to the person, and of the perceived importance of the dimensions to other people. What the researchers used to measure the depression in their participants was a self-esteem test called the Self Attributes Questionnaire created by Pelham and Swann in 1989. The test consisted of 10-point Likert scale ratings on 10 individual social comparison dimensions (e.g. intelligence, social skills, sense of humor). [...] "Questions were added to explore beliefs regarding the importance of social comparison dimensions. Data were collected from a combined clinical sample and non-clinical sample of 174 people." [...] They concluded that social <b>comparison</b> <b>did</b> have a relationship with depression based on the data that they collected. More people that contributed in social comparisons had a higher level of depression than people that rarely used social comparison.|$|E

The correlation between response rates and survival has been examined by reviewing 79 comparisons between arms with unequal response rates in 50 published trials of chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. In 73 % of comparisons the group with the higher response rate also demonstrated the longer median survival (P less than 0. 001).

The system consists of two components, a preprocessing component for automatic generation of key terms for a predefined topic, and a condensation component that produces the condensed versions of on-line documents. To evaluate its performance, we compared Surrogater with five other summarization technologies, including Searchable LEAD, a commercial product. Twenty topics across four domains were evaluated, totalling. 30 documents and 1800 summaries. A two-way ANOVA test suggested that Surrogater performed at least equally well, if not better, compared to other commercial or nearly commercial products.
