40|$|Collateralization {{with daily}} {{margining}} {{has become a}} new standard in the post-crisis market. Although there appeared vast literature on a so-called multi-curve framework, a complete picture of a multi-currency setup with cross-currency basis can be rarely found since our initial attempts. This work gives its extension regarding a general framework of interest rates in a fully collateralized market. It gives a new formulation of the currency funding spread which is better suited for the general dependence. In the last half, it develops a discretization of the HJM framework with a fixed tenor structure, which makes it implementable as a traditional Market Model. Comment: Revised version. Initial title was "choice of <b>collateral</b> <b>currency</b> updated. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{valuation}} of a derivative partially collateralized {{in a specific}} foreign currency defined in its credit support annex traded between default-free counterparties is studied. Two pricing approaches [...] by hedging and by expectation [...] are presented to obtain the same valuation formulae. Our findings show that the current marking-to-market value of such a derivative consists of three components: {{the price of the}} perfectly collateralized derivative (a. k. a. price by collateral rate discounting), the value adjustment due to different funding spreads between the payoff currency and the <b>collateral</b> <b>currency,</b> and the value adjustment due to funding requirements of the uncollateralized exposure. These results generalize previous works on discounting for fully collateralized derivatives and on funding value adjustment for partially collateralized or uncollateralized derivatives. ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that traded foreign {{exchange}} forwards and cross currency swaps (CCS) cannot be priced applying overnight cash and carry arguments as they imply absence of funding advantage of one currency to the other. This paper proposes a heuristic present value concept for multi-currency pricing and hedging which allows taking into account the funding and therefore the <b>collateral</b> <b>currency</b> and its pricing impact. For uncollateralized operations, it provides more funding optionality to achieve either cheaper or more connected funding to the hedging instruments. When foreign exchange forwards get aligned with overnight cash and carry arguments, this method naturally converges to the well established OIS discounting where each leg is funded in its own currency. A worked example compares this approach with a benchmark. Comment: 19 pages, without figures, this version is in review process in Wilmott magazin...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} market {{practice}} for interest rate yield curves construction and pricing interest rate derivatives. Then we give {{a brief description}} of the Vasicek and the Hull-White models, with an example of calibration to market data. We generalize the classical Black-Scholes-Merton pricing formulas, considering more general cases such as perfect or partial collateral, derivatives on a dividend paying asset subject to repo funding, and multiple currencies. Finally we derive generic pricing formulae for different combinations of cash flow and <b>collateral</b> <b>currencies,</b> and we apply the results to the pricing of FX swaps and CCS, and we discuss curve bootstrapping...|$|R

40|$|Collateral {{has been}} used {{for a long time in}} the cash market and we have also {{experienced}} significant increase of its use as an important credit risk mitigation tool in the derivatives market for this decade. Despite its long history in the financial market, its importance for funding has been recognized relatively recently following the explosion of basis spreads in the crisis. This paper has demonstrated the impact of collateralization on derivatives pricing through its funding effects based on the actual data of swap markets. It has also shown the importance of the "choice" of <b>collateral</b> <b>currency.</b> In particular, when a contract allows multiple currencies as eligible collateral as well as its free replacement, the paper has found that the embedded "cheapest-todeliver" option can be quite valuable and significantly change the fair value of a trade. The implications of these findings for risk management have been also discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, we have {{observed}} the dramatic {{increase of the}} use of collateral as an important credit risk mitigation tool. It has become even rare to make a contract without collateral agreement among the major financial institutions. In addition to the significant reduction of the counterparty exposure, collateralization has important implications for the pricing of derivatives through the change of effective funding cost. This paper has demonstrated the impact of collateralization on the derivative pricing by constructing the term structure of swap rates based on the actual market data. It has also shown the importance of the "choice" of <b>collateral</b> <b>currency.</b> Especially, when the contract allows multiple currencies as eligible collateral and free replacement among them, the paper has found that the embedded "cheapest-to-deliver" option can be quite valuable and significantly change the fair value of a trade. The implications of these findings for market risk management have been also discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, we have {{observed}} dramatic increase of collateralization {{as an important}} credit risk mitigation tool in over the counter (OTC) market [6]. Combined with the significant and persistent widening of various basis spreads, such as Libor-OIS and cross currency basis, the practitioners have started to notice the importance of difference between the funding cost of contracts and Libors of the relevant currencies. In this article, we integrate the series of our recent works [1, 2, 4] and explain the consistent construction of term structures of interest rates {{in the presence of}} collateralization and all the relevant basis spreads, their no-arbitrage dynamics as well as their implications for derivative pricing and risk management. Particularly, we have shown the importance of the choice of <b>collateral</b> <b>currency</b> and embedded "cheapestto- deliver" (CTD) option in a collateral agreement.

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{derivation}} of the arbitrage-free pricing framework for multiple-currency collateralized products. We include {{the impact on}} option pricing of the policy adopted to fund in foreign currency, so {{that we are able}} to price contracts with cash flows and/or collateral accounts expressed in foreign currencies inclusive of funding costs originating from dislocations in the FX market. Then, we apply these results to price cross-currency swaps under different market situations, to understand how to implement a feasible curve bootstrap procedure. We present the main practical problems arising from the way the market is quoting liquid instruments: uncertainties about <b>collateral</b> <b>currencies</b> and renotioning features. We discuss the theoretical requirements to implement curve bootstrapping and the approximations usually taken to practically implement the procedure. We also provide numerical examples based on real market data...|$|R
40|$|Bearing in {{mind the}} major risks of lending to small {{enterprises}} and entrepreneurs in Serbia, this paper analyzes this problem and presents the concrete activities that commercial banks should undertake to mitigate these risks. After analyzing the business environment in Serbia and the current lending practice, we have concluded that {{in the process of}} approving loan applications, without exception, the following analyses and activities need to be undertaken: verification of the client's status, financial analysis of the entrepreneurial business, analysis of the entrepreneur's business operations, assessment of how regularly the entrepreneur settles his liabilities, analysis of risks entailed by the bank's offer (i. e. the set of products), evaluation of loan <b>collaterals,</b> <b>currency</b> risk of lending to the business, and risks of lending to a start-up entrepreneurial business. Similar studies were conducted in the United States, yet this particular analysis focuses on the needs and practices of the banking sector in Serbia, with the aim of suggesting to commercial banks to implement the above stated activities and analyses persistently and comprehensively, putting them ahead of accelerated lending procedures, acquisitions and sound, short-term business results...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007 / 08 caused catastrophic consequences {{and brought a}} bunch of changes around the world. Interest rates that were known to follow or behave similarly of each other diverged. Furthermore, the regulation {{and in particular the}} counterparty credit risk began to to be considered and quantified. Consequently, pre-crisis models are no longer valid. Indeed, this work sets the basis to define a valid model that considers the post-crisis world assumptions for the Mexican swap market. The model used in this work was the proposed by Fujii, Shimada and Takahashi in [Fujii et. al., 2010 b]. This model allow us to value interest rate derivatives and future cash flows with the existence of a collateral agreement (with a <b>collateral</b> <b>currency).</b> In this document we build the discounting and projection curves for MXN interest rate derivatives considering the collateral currencies: USD, EUR and MXN. Also, we present the pricing when the derivative is uncollateralized. Finally, we show the effect of the cross-currency swaps when valuing through different collateral currencies...|$|E
2500|$|Pepper was so {{valuable}} {{that it was}} often used as <b>collateral</b> or even <b>currency.</b> In the Dutch language, [...] "pepper expensive" [...] (peperduur) is an expression for something very expensive. The taste for pepper (or the appreciation of its monetary value) was passed on {{to those who would}} see Rome fall. Alaric the Visigoth included 3,000 pounds of pepper as part of the ransom he demanded from Rome when he besieged the city in 5th century. After the fall of Rome, others took over the middle legs of the spice trade, first the Persians and then the Arabs; Innes Miller cites the account of Cosmas Indicopleustes, who travelled east to India, as proof that [...] "pepper was still being exported from India in the sixth century". By the end of the Early Middle Ages, the central portions of the spice trade were firmly under Islamic control. Once into the Mediterranean, the trade was largely monopolized by Italian powers, especially Venice and Genoa. The rise of these city-states was funded in large part by the spice trade.|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} {{on financial}} collateral agreements, provided by Directive 2002 / 47 / EC (so called Collateral Directive) – put into {{force in the}} Italian legal system by legislative decree n. 170 / 2004 – contains specific rules inspired by a principle opposite to that found on the ground of the prohibition of patto commissorio (art. 2744 c. c.). Therefore, {{the implementation of the}} Directive in the Italian legal system has created a specific area – related to financial collateral – in which the prohibition of patto commissorio is ineffective. Furthermore, this European regulation is the expression of a trend favouring self-help remedies for the creditor, who can – if the debt is not paid – sell or appropriate the collateral, subject to the condition that he will give the debtor the difference between the price obtained (or the value of the collateral) and the amount of the debt. The challenge for the Italian doctrine shall therefore be to examine whether the above self-help remedies could be granted in every case in which the value of the collateral can be determined according to objective criteria, such as whether the <b>collateral</b> consists of <b>currency,</b> receivables or financial instruments negotiable in the market...|$|R
