50|$|S. H. <b>Couch</b> was re-organized {{and became}} a {{subsidiary}} of <b>Couch</b> Associates some time between 1926 and 1941. <b>Couch</b> Associates apparently was a financial holding company that served the founder, his spouse, and his adopted brother William <b>Couch.</b> According to an undated letter written by Mr. Samuel <b>Couch,</b> {{the assets of the}} original S. H. <b>Couch</b> company consisted of plant, machinery, inventories, cash in banks and on hand, accounts and notes receivables, and securities such as stocks and bonds of other companies. Mr. <b>Couch</b> noted the plant, machinery and tools, patents, and inventories were sold to the new S. H. <b>Couch</b> company for $240,000.00. Three individuals, Mr. Atkinson, Mr. Cameron and Mr. Morrison, all attached to the new company, were to issue $210,000.00 of 6% preferred stock and $30,000.00 of common stock back to <b>Couch</b> Associates, Inc. The remaining assets of the old S. H. <b>Couch</b> were retained by <b>Couch</b> Associates. According to Mr. <b>Couch's</b> estate tax filings, he held preferred and common stock shares in <b>Couch</b> Associates to his death in 1954.|$|R

5|$|They {{later became}} Mikengreg in 2010 and {{released}} Solipskier in August for both Flash and iOS later that year. Its success {{let them take}} a more experimental approach towards their next game, the free-to-play Gasketball. Mikengreg {{ran out of money}} during the game's development and the two lived on friends' <b>couches.</b> The game was reviewed favorably upon its August 2012 launch, but did not earn near the developers' estimates. Their next game, TouchTone (2015), spent two years in development.|$|E
5|$|Falle had no role models. She {{began writing}} poetry about suicide and wearing black clothing. She acted out by {{stealing}} cars and using drugs recreationally. She {{started out with}} soft drugs and {{then moved on to}} using psychedelic mushrooms and LSD. Her associates in these criminal activities, who came from similarly dysfunctional backgrounds, provided her with a sense of belonging that she no longer found at home. Falle's mother had a series of boyfriends who abused her and made the house unsafe, so Falle ran away from home. She slept at friends' houses, on their <b>couches</b> and in tents in their backyards, concealing her presence from her friends' parents.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball is an action, sports {{video game}} for the iPad by Mikengreg, an {{independent}} development team of Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. Players flick basketballs through 2D physics puzzles into the hoop in single-player, local multiplayer, and asynchronous HORSE-style online multiplayer modes. The game is free-to-play with in-app purchases. Development began in mid 2011 following Mikengreg's successful Solipskier. They were able to live from the earnings for Gasketball two year development at their previous salary, which afforded them the stability to try new avenues and reject prototypes, though they worked 100-hour weeks. Towards {{the end of their}} development, they ran out of money and lived on the <b>couches</b> of friends. It was released on August 9, 2012, and the game did not reach their desired conversion rate at the time of launch.|$|E

5|$|Tower C is {{different}} from Towers A and B in several ways, but primarily {{in the fact that}} its rooms are single occupancy. The rooms are 2/3 the size of rooms in Towers A and B, and like Tower A and Tower B, every third floor has a lounge containing a television, <b>couches,</b> and tables for extra study. In addition, each floor has 30 rooms, except floors containing a lounge, which have 27. No official specialized student communities are housed in Tower C, but designated male and female floors are 24-hour Quiet Living Communities. Up until 2010-11, Tower C was open to students of any year, however it now houses primarily first-year students.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball was {{developed}} and produced by Mikengreg, an Iowa-based two-man team: Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. After releasing their first game, the sport-inspired Solipskier for iPhone and iPad, Boxleiter and Wohlwend lived off the profits for two years while working on Gasketball, paying themselves their same salaries from their Adobe Flash development days but having the security to try new ideas. Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as Puzzlejuice with Asher Vollmer, but shared his income with Boxleiter. Development began in mid 2011. Even though Solipskier was successful, the duo {{did not have a}} following comparable to indie developers like Team Meat and thus did not feel pressured to meet high expectations. Instead, their pressure was internal. Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while living on the Solipskier funds. When they ran out of money, Boxleiter borrowed money from his parents, and eventually they both went homeless, living on the <b>couches</b> of friends.|$|E
5|$|The House of Orpheus in the {{southern}} part of the city thus takes its name from the large mosaic depicting Orpheus playing his harp to an audience of trees, animals and birds. As Paul MacKendrick puts it, the mosaic is rather artlessly executed, as the animals are all of different sizes and face in different directions with no relationship to Orpheus. It appears that the mosaicist simply copied patterns from a book without attempting to integrate the different elements. The mosaic is situated in the triclinium, the dining room, where the diners would have reclined on <b>couches</b> set against the walls and admired the central mosaic. Other mosaics can be seen in the atrium, which has a depiction of Amphitrite in a chariot pulled by a seahorse and accompanied by other sea creatures, and in the bathing rooms. One room off the main courtyard has a mosaic of a dolphin, considered by the Romans to be a lucky animal.|$|E

5|$|Towers A and B {{are very}} similar to each other. All rooms in both towers are doubles, meaning that two people share each room. There is a lounge the size of three dorm rooms every third floor, {{containing}} a large television and several <b>couches</b> and tables for studying. Communal and university-sponsored events frequently take place in the various lounges throughout the towers. Every floor shares a communal bathroom, with several shower and restroom stalls. Each floor has twenty rooms, except for the lounge floors, which only have seventeen. Each floor's resident assistant lives alone in their respective room, meaning each floor houses 39 people. On the ground floor of Tower A there is a small fitness center containing treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and weight equipment. A fully functioning post office and all student mailboxes are located {{on the ground floor of}} Tower B. Due to the fact that both Towers A and B are exclusively residences for first year students, they are both designated as alcohol-free. Its distribution, sale, and consumption, is punished if discovered.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the dynasty (c. 965) the two Zhe provinces (now Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu) presented (to the throne) two dragon ships each more than (60.00m/200ft) in length. The upper works included several decks with palatial cabins and saloons, containing thrones and <b>couches</b> all ready for imperial tours of inspection. After many years, their hulls decayed and needed repairs, but the work was impossible {{as long as they were}} afloat. So in the Xi-Ning reign period (1068 to 1077) a palace official Huang Huaixin suggested a plan. A large basin was excavated at the north end of the Jinming Lake capable of containing the dragon ships, and in it heavy crosswise beams were laid down upon a foundation of pillars. Then (a breach was made) so that the basin quickly filled with water, after which the ships were towed in above the beams. The (breach now being closed) the water was pumped out by wheels so that the ships rested quite in the air. When the repairs were complete, the water was let in again, so that the ships were afloat once more (and could leave the dock). Finally the beams and pillars were taken away, and the whole basin covered over with a great roof so as to form a hangar in which the ships could be protected from the elements and avoid the damage caused by undue exposure.|$|E
