5|$|As a {{follow-on}} to the Nilgiris, India commenced {{development of}} a new frigate, based on the Leander/Nilgiri, but larger. The resultant , also known as Project 16, <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> two Sea Kings simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Close {{support for}} the battle fleet. They could be {{stationed}} {{at the ends of}} the battle line to stop enemy cruisers harassing the battleships, and to harass the enemy's battleships if they were busy fighting battleships. Also, the Invincibles <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> as the fast wing of the battlefleet and try to outmanouevre the enemy.|$|E
5|$|During 2000–2001, Drukair <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> {{with only}} one single {{aircraft}} {{for over a year}} due to a corrosion defect in its A5-RGD aircraft in the wing tanks that was detected during a check at Woodford. The wings were replaced. In 2002, an RJ70 was wet-leased from airBaltic to cover for maintenance to A5-RGE.|$|E

5|$|Photons {{have many}} {{applications}} in technology. These examples are chosen to illustrate applications of photons per se, rather than general optical {{devices such as}} lenses, etc. that <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> under a classical theory of light. The laser is an extremely important application and is discussed above under stimulated emission.|$|E
5|$|Since 1983, large festivals have {{required}} licences from local authorities. This led to certain restrictions {{being placed on}} the festival, including a crowd limit and specified times during which the stages <b>could</b> <b>operate.</b> The crowd limit was initially set at 30,000 but has grown every year to over 100,000.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Sustainment Brigade was {{permanently}} {{attached to}} the 1st Cavalry Division, though it <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> independently when needed. Currently, it falls under {{the organization of the}} 1st Armored Division, having relocated as part of the Base Realignment and Closure 2005. This assignment allows the unit maximum flexibility when deployed, as it can provide any support function needed, without being permanently attached to any particular unit or area of operations.|$|E

5|$|The T2000 {{operated}} on Line 1 of the T-bane, and replaced the aging HkB 600 teak wagons {{used on the}} Holmenkoll Line. The units were equipped with both third rail and overhead wire collectors, so they <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> on the Common Line and on the Holmenkoll Line. The trains were a prototype for a new design intended to replace the aging T1000 stock, but the MX3000 was chosen instead, as the T2000 did not perform satisfactorily. The T2000 were taken out of service in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of an}} {{aluminium}} {{body was}} controversial, and international experts recommended that the tram company should not choose that solution. The goal was to decrease the weight so the trams <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> with less-powerful motors, giving a lower cost. The first prototype was a full-scale model of a tram, built at Homansbyen Depot in 1935, using an undercarriage from disused horsecars.|$|E
5|$|This {{was about}} to get worse, when France and the Low Countries fell in May to June 1940. U-boats <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> from French Atlantic ports, {{reducing}} their need to make the dangerous journey from ports in Norway or Germany around Scotland, and increasing their operational range in the ocean by several hundred miles. The Luftwaffe with its small, but valuable fleet of Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors, could now operate from the same area. From June 1940 onwards, the Battle of the Atlantic began in earnest.|$|E

5|$|Three bids were {{submitted}} by the deadline of 1 April 1997, and the contract with Talbot, which had just been bought by Bombardier, was finalized on 27 November 1997. By this time the order had been extended to eleven units, which are variations of the Talbot Talent. Before delivery a further four units were purchased, so the trains <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> all the services on the Nordland Line, replacing most of the locomotive-hauled day trains. Only the night train would remain locomotive-hauled.|$|E
5|$|Tram no. 141 {{arrived at}} Oslo on 5 January 1999 in three parts. They were {{connected}} together and tried within {{the end of}} the month on the entire network, prior to the delivery of tram 142. Delivery frequency was set to every two weeks. During periods from April through June, the voltage along sections of the Lilleaker Line was raised from 600 to 750V; this included trials with the SL95 to ensure that it <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> under this current as well.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1943 the Axis forces had complete control of the airspace over Yugoslavian territory. No aerial opposition of any kind was expected {{and that was the}} primary reason that the bomber force <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> without any fighter cover, notwithstanding {{the fact that there was}} a total lack of any serious fighter force in the ZNDH's squadrons. However, the situation started to change by {{the beginning}} of 1943. The Headquarters (HQ) of the ZNDH had plans to re-arm at least one Group with more modern aircraft of German or Italian origin. The Italians refused to supply the requested Macchi C.200 and Macchi C.202 fighters, as the Regia Aeronautica needed every aircraft to fill its own squadrons in {{the beginning of}} 1943.|$|E

In 2005 the company made a phone with dual SIM-slot which <b>could</b> <b>operated</b> {{simultaneity}} in both GSM and CDMA-based mobile networks, {{which was the first}} manufacturer in the world to invent it.|$|R
5|$|Chapman's {{archipelago}} frigates provided better {{protection for}} their crew than the galleys they replaced, {{and up to}} three times the capacity for stores and provisions. They <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> in the narrow, shallow waters around skerries in all weathers and in open water {{in all but the}} worst storms. They had a deeper draft than galleys, but considerably shallower draft than traditional sailing warships. The new ship types also increased the archipelago fleet's firepower, provided it with better defensive capabilities, and made possible more efficient fire support in amphibious operations.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, the Sultanate of Sulu granted {{use of an}} area {{of land in the}} Sandakan Bay to William Frederick Schuck, {{a former}} agent of the German {{consular}} service who had lived on the Sulu island of Jolo since 1864. The arrival of German warship Nymph at the Sulu Sea in 1872 to investigate the Sulu-Spanish conflict made the Sultanate believe Schuck was connected with the German government. The Sultanate authorised Schuck to establish a trading port to monopolise the rattan trade in the northeast coast, where Schuck <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> freely, without the Spanish blockade. He continued this operation until this land also was ceded to Overbeck, with the Sultan receiving an annual payment of $5,000, by a treaty signed in 1878.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the Air Force was {{tasked with}} {{gathering}} intelligence, air reconnaissance, and air transport. Support of ground troops, both doctrinally {{and as a}} practical matter, became marginal. These missions were strongly influenced by a shrinking capability, since its combat aircraft <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> by daylight only, its anti-aircraft artillery was obsolete, and the FLORIDA radar system had reached the limits of operational effectiveness. The retirement of the Hawker Hunters in 1994ended its ground support capability, and a cut of one-third from the defence budget meant that plans for a second purchase of F/A-18s and supporting air-to-ground weapons (the reason the multi-capable Hornet was selected) had to be canceled, leaving both it and the F-5s in a strictly air-to-air role.|$|E
50|$|Previous Granger-causality methods <b>could</b> only <b>operate</b> on continuous-valued data so the {{analysis}} of neural spike train recordings involved transformations that ultimately altered the stochastic properties of the data, indirectly altering {{the validity of the}} conclusions that could be drawn from it. Recently however, a new general-purpose Granger-causality framework was proposed that <b>could</b> directly <b>operate</b> on any modality, including neural-spike trains.|$|R

5|$|It {{had been}} {{decided that the}} Bergen Line, unlike the Voss Line, was to be built with {{standard}} gauge. So the newly laid line from Bergen to Voss had to be converted {{in time for the}} opening of the Bergen Line. This was especially challenging because of the continuous traffic on the line, with 36 departures per day to Nesttun, six to Garnes and four to Voss. In preparation a few curves had to be straightened, the tunnels widened and the bridges strengthened. On the night of 10/11 August 1904 all the track was changed and in the morning the trains <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> on standard gauge to Voss.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{declared}} neutrality at {{the start}} of World War I, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic, which could also be easily seeded with minefields. The threat from these underwater weapons was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations.|$|E
5|$|Oslo Sporveier {{was highly}} {{satisfied}} with the SL79 articulated trams that had been delivered during the 1980s. In 1985, work started {{on the development of}} a modified version for the western suburban lines. The stock on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås Lines were the first that needed to be replaced. At the same time, the company wanted to make the trains compatible with the metro so they <b>could</b> <b>operate</b> on both systems. The new stock was considered to be a trial; if it met performance expectations, future orders could be made to replace the T1000 stock, after the latter reached the end of its economical life in about 2000. The required specification for the new train was published in October 1988.|$|E
