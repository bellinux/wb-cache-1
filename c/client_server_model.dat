His presidency was marked by the addition of graduate degrees, the massive growth of computer facilities. In 1977, Lawrence Tech shed its [...] "commuter" [...] classification by opening the nine-story University Housing-South residence hall. The Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Affleck House in Bloomfield Hills was donated to the University in 1978. The Wayne H. Buell Management Building and the Don Ridler Field House were completed during his presidency. Numerous improvements to existing buildings, and a substantial increase in state-of-the-art laboratory and computer equipment were highlights of these years. Master's degree programs in management were launched in 1989, and in engineering in 1990. Simultaneously, LIT's change to its present name, Lawrence Technological University, was approved on January 1, 1989, by the State of Michigan, and more clearly described Lawrence Tech's undergraduate and graduate mission.Charles M. Chambers became president in 1993 and served as chancellor in 2006. During his presidency, he oversaw significant enhancement of the University's international reputation as a distinguished center of technological education and research. A Strategic Plan and Campus Master Plan were adopted to guide the University. Other achievements included construction of the University Technology and Learning Center, University Housing-North; the A. Alfred Taubman Student Services Center; a redeveloped campus quadrangle; the Center for Innovative Materials Research; establishment of a Faculty Senate; conversion of the computer system to a <b>client</b> <b>server</b> <b>model</b> with full Internet2 connectivity and online library access; creation of Michigan's first completely wireless laptop campus; and expanded bookstore, dining, and student activity facilities. Master of Architecture program was added in 1993, and graduate degree in Arts and Sciences in 1997. Doctoral programs were launched in 2002. The University Technology and Learning Center opened in 2001, University Housing-North in 2002, and the A. Alfred Taubman Student Services Center and the Center for Innovative Materials Research in 2006. Lewis N. Walker was named interim president in February 2006, became president on July 1, and was inaugurated on November 2, 2006. He had previously served as provost, the University's chief academic officer, and executive vice president. Walker was committed to developing the leadership skills of Lawrence Tech's students and worked with faculty to add a leadership component to the curricula of all undergraduate programs. In addition, he engaged in partnerships with universities worldwide that brought international students to campus and provided further opportunities for Lawrence Tech students to study abroad. Most importantly, Lewis Walker was a valued tenured faculty member in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Varsity athletics returned under his watch in 2011.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Public Geographic Information system (GIS) is a {{solution}} that automates the process of collecting community contributions of spatial data, cross-referenced to base maps. It provides the capabilities of analyzing such spatial data giving effective decision support information. On the other hand, the most important implementation models for GIS used recently are Client-Server and Software as a Service (SaaS). This paper focus on giving typical situation {{as a case study}} for exploring the advantages of SaaS implementation model over Client server one where public GIS services are implemented first as <b>client</b> <b>server</b> <b>model</b> and secondly when implemented as SaaS. In our new urban City state office, SaaS implementation achieved huge reduction on the total cost of ownership for users of public GIS solution rather than previous GIS Client-Server implementation. High level of cooperative collaboration between departments has been achieved (e. g. survey dept., land use dept.). Achieved huge reduction on front-up cost required to start using the GIS solution (typically it costs 4. 26 % of the total front-up cost in case client-server model is used which was 214000 USD), and reduction in maintenance /installation hours needed to fix a bug or install new feature across department rather than previous GIS Client Server implementation where the same maintenance /installation hours must be replicated to install new batch containing the fix for new feature. Hence, SaaS implementation model for public GIS overcomes <b>Client</b> <b>Server</b> <b>model</b> in many different aspects and increased the Return On Investment (ROI) value for public GIS solution as it empowers departments in state office to focus in delivering more spatial business's value rather than being busy with having a dedicated data center to operate and manage separate installation of GIS software in <b>client</b> <b>server</b> <b>model...</b>|$|E
