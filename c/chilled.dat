5|$|During the 1870s ice {{began to}} be used by Timothy Eastman, of the Bell Brothers firm, to {{transport}} American meat to Britain; the first shipment successfully arrived in 1875 and by the following year 9,888 tons (8,909,000kg) of meat was shipped. The <b>chilled</b> meat was retailed through special warehouses and stores. There was concern in Britain that <b>chilled</b> American meat might flood the market and harm domestic farmers, but the exports continued. The rival Chicago-based meat firms of Armour and Swift entered the refrigerated meat transport market in the late 1870, establishing their own fleet of refrigerator cars, network of icing stations and other infrastructure, increasing the sales of <b>chilled</b> Chicago beef to the eastern seaboard from 15,680 tons (14,128,000kg) a year in 1880, to 173,067 tons (155,933,000kg) in 1884.|$|E

40|$|Dormancy is {{commonly}} separated into a rest period, when the buds remain dormant due to growth-arresting physiological conditions, and a quiescent period, when the buds remain dormant due to unfavourable environmental conditions. A sequential model predicting {{the number of}} days during dormancy based on accumulation of <b>chill</b> days during rest and anti-chill days during quiescence is described. <b>Chill</b> days and anti-chill days are calculated using the single triangle method to estimate degree days relative to a threshold temperature. The temperature threshold for calculating the <b>chill</b> and anti-chill days and the <b>chilling</b> requirement to determine when rest is broken are found by trial and error to minimize the root mean square error of predicted and observed bud-burst dates. Using several years of weather and phenological data for cherry, pear, kiwifruit and olive orchards and nine forest species from locations in Sardinia, Italy, the <b>Chill</b> days model performed better than four classical <b>chill</b> unit models and two <b>chilling</b> hour models. The classical <b>chill</b> unit and <b>chilling</b> hour models failed to predict bud-burst in some years depending on the species and climate, whereas the <b>Chill</b> days model always gave good results. The classical <b>chill</b> unit and <b>chilling</b> hour models start to accumulate <b>chilling</b> when temperatures fall below the threshold in autumn, whereas the <b>Chill</b> days model begins to accumulate <b>chilling</b> at a phenological stage (i. e. leaf fall or harvest). Moreover, the classical <b>chill</b> unit and <b>chilling</b> hour models do not separate dormancy into rest and quiescent periods.

An idealized daily temperature curve was used to convert daily temperature records from 43 weather stations, taken throughout the twentieth and late nineteenth centuries, into an hourly dataset, which was then converted to units of winter <b>chill.</b> Besides exposing temporal trends in winter <b>chill,</b> the data could be spatially interpolated, yielding contiguous maps of typical winter <b>chill</b> in Germany around 2010, as well as <b>chilling</b> losses since 1950. Throughout Germany, winter <b>chill</b> varied between 1700 and 3000 <b>Chilling</b> Hours or 125 and 150 <b>Chill</b> Portions. The areas of highest winter <b>chill</b> were located in the northern parts of the country. For the whole of Germany, there were no significant temporal trends. The extent of interregional variation in winter <b>chill</b> depended on the <b>chilling</b> model used. While the <b>Chilling</b> Hours Model showed strong declines in winter <b>chill</b> for the areas around Dresden and Leipzig, {{as well as for the}} Lake Constance region, the Dynamic Model did not detect such dramatic changes. More than a decline in winter <b>chill,</b> increased heat during the winter months might become a challenge to German fruit growers.

5|$|By the 1860s, natural ice was {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} move western American products to the east, starting with <b>chilled</b> meat from Chicago. There was some initial opposition, both from the cattle-car owners and from eastern butchers, who stood to lose out from the trade; by the 1870s, however, multiple shipments were leaving for the east each day. <b>Chilled</b> butter from the mid-West was then shipped onwards from New York to Europe, and by the 1870s 15 percent of the United Kingdom's butter consumption was being met in this way. A chain of icing stations at Chicago, Omaha, Utah and Sierra Nevada allowed railroad refrigerator cars to cross the continent. The ability of ice companies to ship their product by rail from the east proved the final straw for the Alaskan ice trade, which collapsed during the 1870s and 1880s {{in the face of}} the competition, destroying the local saw-mill industry in the process.|$|E

40|$|Many {{fruit and}} nut trees must fulfill a <b>chilling</b> {{requirement}} to break their winter dormancy and resume normal growth in spring. Several models exist for quantifying winter <b>chill,</b> and growers and researchers often tacitly {{assume that the}} choice of model is not important and estimates of species <b>chilling</b> requirements are valid across growing regions. To test this assumption, Safe Winter <b>Chill</b> (the amount of winter <b>chill</b> that is exceeded in 90 % of years) was calculated for 5, 078 weather stations around the world, using the Dynamic Model [in <b>Chill</b> Portions (CP) ], the <b>Chilling</b> Hours (CH) Model and the Utah Model [Utah <b>Chill</b> Units (UCU) ]. Distributions of the ratios between different winter <b>chill</b> metrics were mapped on a global scale. These ratios should be constant if the models were strictly proportional. Ratios between winter <b>chill</b> metrics varied substantially, with the CH/CP ratio ranging between 0 and 34, the UCU/CP ratio between − 155 and + 20 and the UCU/CH ratio between − 10 and + 5. The models are thus not proportional, and <b>chilling</b> requirements determined in a given location may not be valid elsewhere. The Utah Model produced negative winter <b>chill</b> totals in many Subtropical regions, where {{it does not seem}} to be useful. Mean annual temperature and daily temperature range influenced all winter <b>chill</b> ratios, but explained only between 12 and 27 % of the variation. Data on <b>chilling</b> requirements should always be amended with information on the location and experimental conditions of the study in which they were determined, ideally including site-specific conversion factors between winter <b>chill</b> models. This would greatly facilitate the transfer of such information across growing regions, and help prepare growers for the impact of climate change...|$|R

5|$|Refrigerated {{ships were}} also made {{possible}} {{through the ice}} trade, allowing perishable goods to be exported internationally, first from the U.S. and then from countries such as Argentina and Australia. Early ships had stored their <b>chilled</b> goods along with the main cargo of ice; the first ships to transport <b>chilled</b> meat to Britain, designed by Bate, adapted the railroad refrigerator cars, using ice {{at either end of}} the hold and a ventilation fan to keep the meat cool. An improved version, invented by James Craven, piped a brine solution through the ice and then the hold to keep the meat cool, and created a drier atmosphere in the hold, preserving the meat better. Natural ice was also used in fishing industries to preserve catches, initially in the eastern American fisheries. In 1858 the Grimsby fishing fleet began to take ice out to sea with them to preserve their catches; this allowed longer journeys and bigger catches, and the fishing industry became the biggest single user of ice in Britain.|$|E

By mid-19th century, water was always <b>chilled</b> in America if possible. Iced milk also popular, and German lager, traditionally drunk <b>chilled,</b> also used ice. Drinks such as sherry-cobblers and mint juleps were created that could only be made using crushed ice. There were distinct differences in 19th-century American and European attitudes to adding ice directly to drinks, with the Europeans regarding this as an unpleasant habit; British visitors to India were surprised to see the Anglo-Indian elite prepared to drink iced water. Some Hindus in India regarded ice as unclean for religious reasons, and as such an inappropriate food.|$|E
