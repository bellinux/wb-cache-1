40|$|We {{consider}} a symbolic coding for geodesics {{on the family}} of Veech surfaces (translation surfaces rich with affine symmetries) recently discovered by Bouw and Möller. These surfaces, as noticed by Hooper, can be realized by cutting and pasting a collection of semi-regular polygons. We characterize the set of symbolic <b>sequences</b> (<b>cutting</b> <b>sequences)</b> that arise by coding linear trajectories by the sequence of polygon sides crossed. We provide a full characterization for {{the closure of the}} set of <b>cutting</b> <b>sequences,</b> {{in the spirit of the}} classical characterization of Sturmian sequences and the recent characterization of Smillie-Ulcigrai of <b>cutting</b> <b>sequences</b> of linear trajectories on regular polygons. The characterization is in terms of a system of finitely many substitutions (also known as an S-adic presentation), governed by a one-dimensional continued fraction-like map. As in the Sturmian and regular polygon case, the characterization is based on renormalization and the definition of a suitable combinatorial derivation operator. One of the novelties is that derivation is done in two steps, without directly using Veech group elements, but by exploiting an affine diffeomorphism that maps a Bouw-Möller surface to the dual Bouw-Möller surface in the same Teichmüller disk. As a technical tool, we crucially exploit the presentation of Bouw-Möller surfaces via Hooper diagrams. Comment: 74 pages, 50 figures. Comments welcome...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the cutting sequences of geodesic flow on the modular surface H/PSL(2,Z) {{with respect to}} the standard fundamental domain F = z=x+iy: - 1 / 2 = 1 of PSL(2,Z). The <b>cutting</b> <b>sequence</b> for a vertical geodesic θ+it: t > 0 is related to a one-dimensional continued fraction expansion for θ, called the one-dimensional Minkowski geodesic continued fraction (MGCF) expansion, which is associated to a parametrized family of reduced bases of a family of 2 -dimensional lattices. The set of cutting sequences for all geodesics forms a two-sided shift in a symbol space L,R,J which has the same set of forbidden blocks as for vertical geodesics. We show that this shift is not a sofic shift, and that it characterizes the fundamental domain F up to an isometry of the hyperbolic plane H. We give conversion methods between the <b>cutting</b> <b>sequence</b> for the vertical geodesic θ+it: t > 0, the MGCF expansion of θ and the additive ordinary continued fraction (ACF) expansion of θ. We show that the <b>cutting</b> <b>sequence</b> and MGCF expansions can each be computed from the other by a finite automaton, and the ACF expansion of θ can be computed from the <b>cutting</b> <b>sequence</b> for the vertical geodesic θ+it by a finite automaton.

40|$|Roof support {{awaiting}} time’ (RSAT) is a {{term used}} at Goedehoop Colliery’s Simunye Shaft to describe the potential production time lost due to the continuous miner (CM) standing idle waiting for roof support to catch up. Investigations revealed that in 2013, Simunye Shaft had approximately 1400 hours of RSAT, {{which suggests that the}} mine could have potentially produced an additional 280 000 t of coal. This project consisted of two parts. Firstly, the causes of the high RSAT and means to improve the situation were investigated. Secondly, as insisted by mine management, the CM <b>cutting</b> <b>sequence</b> was investigated as a possible cause of high RSAT. Machine-related challenges due to the roofbolter installing support too slowly, geological conditions (mostly hard roof conditions and slips), logistical challenges pertaining to the CM <b>cutting</b> <b>sequence,</b> man-related challenges related to operator fatigue, re-support, operator inexperience, and the absence of support targets were identified as main contributors to RSAT. Furthermore, results showed that the roofbolters in the sections at Simunye Shaft are slower than the CMs. A target of 28 % reduction in RSAT was set. Experts from Kennametal and Fletcher were consulted to find solutions for the identified causes. In total, eight solutions for RSAT were identified, but the solution that contributed most significantly to reducing RSAT was to use hard roof drill bits as a standard product at Simunye Shaft. Calculations showed that by using hard roof drill bits, RSAT can be reduced by 43 %, which is more than the specified 28 % target. The cutting sequences at Kriel, Greenside, and Simunye Shaft, together with three newly developed cutting sequences, were simulated using the UCMS (Underground Coal Mining Simulation) program. A re-aligning principle was incorporated into the newly developed cutting sequences to align the cutting sequences to general support work and to reduce RSAT. A decision matrix revealed that a <b>cutting</b> <b>sequence</b> in which boxing takes place in R 3 (third road {{to the right of the}} belt road) and in which the realigning principle has been incorporated will be the best option for Simunye Shaft.

The second is a key pass. This pass cuts a key at the toe of the new highwall and also shifts the bench further towards the low-wall. This may also require a chop pass if the wall is blocky. A chop pass involves the bucket being dropped down onto an angled highwall to scale the surface. The next sequence is the slowest operation, the blocks pass. However, this pass moves most of the material. It involves using the key to access to bottom of the material to lift it up to spoil or to an elevated bench level. The final cut if required is a pull back, pulling material back further to the low-wall side.|$|R
