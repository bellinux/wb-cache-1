40|$|International audiencePost-collisional {{context is}} {{commonly}} associated with production of large amount of peraluminous granitic magmas produced from the melting of crustal material. The variability of the produced granite commonly varies from leucogranitic to granodioritic and are mostly peraluminous. The South-Eastern French Massif Central (EFMC) region record several evidence for crustal <b>melting</b> revealed <b>by</b> migmatitic and granitic bodies providing ~ 30 Ma history of peraluminous granite production. Previous thermobarometric studies provides records for two successivves melting event: 1) a biotite stable event at ~ 314 Ma (720 °C and 5 kb) 2) a bitotite breakdown melting event constrained at ~ 301 Ma (850 °C 4 kb) This suggests geotherms evolution from 45 °C/km to 70 °C/km in 13 Ma. A thermodynamic modelling approach considering a 20 km thick pile of crustal material undergoing successive geotherm evolving from 25 °C/km to 70 °C/km with starting conditions between 3 and 10 kb. Along this evolution our approach allows successive melt extraction and the monitoring of melt compositional variability, residuum evolution and mineral phases modal and compositional variabities according to depth, geotherm and composition of the source. Over the 5 crustal sources used as starting composition for the model, 305 individual partial melting reactions are triggered. Melt and peritectic phases produced provide a variability that suggest the importance of source composition in matter of granite production for some element and ratios (K/Na, XMg). Compared to regional granites (EMCF). Most of the granites produced in the post collisional context of the EFMC can be reproduced <b>by</b> either <b>melt</b> <b>only</b> (leucogranite) or <b>melt</b> in addition to peritectic material produced along with melt (granite to granodiorite). In the same way, the relative-time constrain provided by the approach shows {{that it is possible}} to produce simultaneously heterogeneous granitic magmas in respect to source protolith and depth. Identically, the residual crust undergo an very variable evolution depending on protolith leading to an heterogeneous granulitic lower crust...|$|R

40|$|Although {{water in}} the mantle is mostly present as trace H {{dissolved}} in minerals, it has a large influence on its melting and rheological properties. The water content of the mantle lithosphere beneath continents is better constrained by abundant mantle xenolith data than beneath oceans where it is mainly inferred from MORB glass analysis. Using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry, we determined the water content of olivine (Ol), clinopyroxene (Cpx) and orthopyroxene (Opx) in spinel peridotite xenoliths from Salt Lake Crater, Oahu, Hawaii, which are thought to represent fragments of the Pacific oceanic lithosphere that was refertilized <b>by</b> alkalic Hawaiian <b>melts.</b> <b>Only</b> Ol exhibits H diffusion profiles, evidence of limited H loss during xenolith transport to the surface. Water concentrations (Ol: 9 - 28 ppm H 2 O, Cpx: 246 - 566 ppm H 2 O, Opx: 116 - 224 ppm H 2 O) are {{within the range of}} those from continental settings but higher than those from Gakkel ridge abyssal peridotites. The Opx H 2 O contents {{are similar to those of}} abyssal peridotites from Atlantic ridge Leg 153 (170 - 230 ppm) but higher than those from Leg 209 (10 - 14 ppm). The calculated bulk peridotite water contents (94 to 144 ppm H 2 O) are in agreement with MORB mantle source water estimates and lower than estimates for the source of Hawaiian rejuvenated volcanism (approx 540 ppm H 2 O). The water content of Cpx and most Opx correlates negatively with spinel Cr#, and positively with pyroxene Al and HREE contents. This is qualitatively consistent with the partitioning of H into the melt during partial melting, but the water contents are too high for the degree of melting these peridotites experienced. Melts in equilibrium with xenolith minerals have H 2 O/Ce ratios similar to those of OI...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{consequences}} of global warming is the increase of melt on glaciers. This increase of melt could cause the glacier to move faster in the ablation zone and the glacier could decrease faster in size.

Annual average velocities {{do not seem to be}} influenced <b>by</b> the <b>melt,</b> at least not such a big enough influence that it shows in these observations. The data is also used to look at trends in velocity, but no significant trend in the velocity was found over the years 2007 - 2014.
