40|$|To {{assure a}} correct {{position}} and {{orientation of the}} patient's eye in radiation treatment, a new approach in image-guided radiotherapy is {{used to determine the}} misalignment of the eye and the respective correction for the patient support devices. New methods allow correcting the misalignment of the patient's eye full-automatically. Therefore, metallic clips attached to the patient's eyeball are detected in a CT and in two digital X-ray images. Corresponding pairs of <b>clip</b> <b>positions</b> found in the X-ray images are then transferred into the 3 D space of the CT volume via inverse projection and compared to the clips found in the CT slices.

40|$|The {{planning}} of proton beam irradiation of intraocular tumors typically requires a 3 -dimensional {{model of the}} patient’s eye based on measurements taken with ultrasound, fundus photography and during surgery. Tantalum marker clips sutured to the diseased eye’s sclera {{play a central role}} in tumor modeling and, during irradiation, in the precise positioning of the patient. Modern high-resolution computed tomography (CT) images may help during the eye modeling. A verification of the eye model with CT data normally entails a time-consuming procedure since this step is not implemented in the standard planning software. The time-consuming procedure of verifying the eye model can be shortened by using automated image processing. To enable such a quality control procedure, a software has been developed that allows the superposition of CT data and eye model, the automatic determination of <b>clip</b> <b>positions,</b> and the calculation of clip-to-clip distances and distance measurements using the CT data. A 3 -D segmentation algorithm was developed to automatically segment the volumes of each clip in the CT datasets. The volume center points are used to define the <b>clip</b> <b>positions</b> and to determine the distances between the clips. The process was evaluated using phantom measurements and subsequently applied to more than 500 patients. The planning process was substantially faster than the conventional comparison method using CT film printouts. The Hahn-Meitner-Institut (HMI) Berlin needs the CT data for planning and conducting the therapy. A concept has been developed to transfer the data securely from Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin (Campus Benjamin Franklin) to HMI via the internet.

Using lentiviral gene transfer in vivo, we expressed the immunodominant epitope of collagen type II (CII) on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (MHC II) in a mouse model of destructive arthritis. A sequence corresponding to amino acids 259 - 270 of CII was fused into the class II-associated invariant chain peptide (<b>CLIP)</b> <b>position</b> of the invariant chain to achieve efficient binding to MHC II. Transduction of cloned cells and primary antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in vitro demonstrated successful presentation of the peptide on MHC II, and a physiological glycosylation pattern. Compared with controls, mice intravenously injected with lentiviral vectors encoding this epitope displayed significantly less frequent, less severe, and less destructive arthritis, decreased lymphocyte proliferation in response to restimulation with CII, and lower CII-specific antibody levels. This was associated with an increased production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in vitro. We suggest that overexpression of the immunodominant CII epitope on MHC II induces T cell production of TGF-beta and leads to inhibition of arthritis by means of both antigen-specific and bystander mechanisms.

BackgroundIn patients with challenging anatomy, the application of PMVR is limited, potentially resulting in insufficient reduction of mitral regurgitation (MR) or clip detachment. Under general anesthesia, however, ventilation maneuvers can be used to facilitate PMVR. MethodsA total of 50 consecutive patients undergoing PMVR were included. During mechanical ventilation, different levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were applied, and parameters of heart geometry were assessed using transesophageal echocardiography. ResultsWe found that increased PEEP results in elevated central venous pressure. Specifically, central venous pressure increased from 14. 0 ± 6. 5 mm Hg (PEEP 3 mm Hg) to 19. 3 ± 5. 9 mm Hg (PEEP 20 mm Hg; p  4. 9 mm at PEEP of 10 mm Hg resulted in a significant reduction of PMVR procedure time (152 ± 49 min to 116 ± 26 min; p = 0. 05).

Also, the influence of kVp, concentration of contrast material, and clip orientation in clipped patients was studied. METHODS: A phantom containing a clip was scanned with varying parameters. Artifact was quantified with 3 D volumetry. Artifact volumes were compared for the different parameters. In addition, the number of artifact streaks was presented {{as a function of}} the pitch. Five clipped patients were scanned with 90 kVp and 120 kVp and 5 with 120 kVp and 140 kVp. The artifact area was compared.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Outcome of {{surgical}} treatment of cerebral aneurysms may be severely compromised by local cerebral ischaemia or infarction {{resulting from the}} inadvertent occlusion of an adjacent vessel by the aneurysm clip, or by incomplete aneurysm closure. It is therefore mandatory to optimise clip placement in situ to reduce the complication rate. The present study was performed to investigate the reliability of intraoperative microvascular Doppler ultrasonography (MDU) in cerebral aneurysm surgery, and {{to assess the impact}} of this method on the surgical procedure itself.  METHODS—Seventy five patients (19 men, 56 women, mean age 54. 8 years, range 22 - 84 years) with 90 saccular cerebral aneurysms were evaluated. Blood flow velocities in the aneurysmal sac and in the adjacent vessels were determined by MDU before and after aneurysm clipping. The findings of MDU were analysed and compared with those of visual inspection of the surgical site and of postoperative angiography. Analysis was also made of the cases in which the clip was repositioned due to MDU findings.  RESULTS—A relevant stenosis of an adjacent vessel induced by <b>clip</b> <b>positioning</b> that had escaped detection by visual inspection was identified by Doppler ultrasonography in 17 out of 90 (18. 9 %) aneurysms. In addition, Doppler ultrasound demonstrated a primarily unoccluded aneurysm in 11 out of 90 (12. 2 %) patients. The aneurysm clip was repositioned on the basis of the MDU findings in 26 out of 90 (28. 8 %) cases. In middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms, the MDU results were relevant to the surgical procedure in 17 out of 44 (38. 6 %) cases. Whereas with aneurysms of the anterior cerebral artery significant findings occurred in only five of 32 cases (15. 6 %; p< 0. 05). The clip was repositioned on the basis of the MDU results in 18 out of 50 (36 %) aneurysms in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) grade I-V compared with only eight out of 40 (20 %) aneurysms in patients without SAH (p< 0. 05).  CONCLUSIONS—MDU should be used routinely in cerebral aneurysm surgery, especially in cases of MCA aneurysms and after SAH. Present data show that a postoperative angiography becomes superfluous whenever there is good visualisation of the "working site" and MDU findings are clear. ...|$|R

An algorithm is proposed for estimating the source directions in addition to the estimation of unknown array parameters such as sensor gains and phases, as a way of performing array self-calibration. The cost function is an extension of the maximum likelihood (ML) criteria that were originally developed for DOA estimation with a perfectly calibrated array. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to explore the high-dimensional problem space and find the global minimum of the cost function. The design of the PSO is a combination of the problem-independent kernel and some newly introduced problem-specific features such as search space mapping, particle velocity control, and particle <b>position</b> <b>clipping.</b> This architecture plus properly selected parameters make the PSO highly flexible and reusable, while being sufficiently specific and effective in the current application.

40|$|Motivation: Attentional {{allocation}} {{is determined}} by the interplay between bottom-up and top-down influences. Here we try to quantify the relative contributions of different influences on attentional allocation in dynamic scenes, as well as examine how they change over time. Methods: In order to manipulate the availability of top-down influences on attentional allocation, heterogeneous video clips were cut into clippets (M= 2 s), which were scrambled and re-assembled into MTV-style clips. Two groups of 8 Subjects each were instructed to "follow the main actors and actions". One group viewd the original stimuli while the other group viewd the MTV-style <b>clips.</b> Eye <b>positions</b> were recorded using an ISCAN eye-tracker (240 Hz, yielding a total of more than a million samples for each group), and segmented into saccades, blinks, and fixation/smooth pursuit periods. A saliency-based model of attention capture (Itti & Koch 2000) was used to probe the relative contribution of bottom-up influences on attentional allocation based on a novel performance metric - Chance-Adjusted Saliency Accumometric (CASA). CASA values were computed based on the weighted sum of differences between normalized saliency at human vs. random saccade targets. Results: Total CASA based on the full saliency model was 6 % higher in the MTV group compared to the original group. In both original and MTV groups, CASA based on either motion or flicker features alone was ~ 95 % of the CASA based on the full saliency model. CASA based on either color, intensity, or orientation features alone was ~ 66 % of the full model CASA. Generally, CASA values for earlier saccades after stimulus onset (clip or clippet start) were higher than for later saccades, but tapered off and flactuated around a fairly high value after the first several saccades. Conclusions: The 6 % CASA difference between the original and MTV groups shows that eliminating visual context beyond the first ~ 2 s of viewing barely increased the overall relative weight of bottom-up influences on attentional allocation. Our results imply that the relative weight of top-down influences on attentional allocation in dynamic scenes does not increase with viewing time (beyond the first ~ 2 s). We also found that either motion or flicker are ~ 150 % stronger than either color, intensity, or orientation as bottom-up attractors of attention...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to discuss the intraoperative validation of CT-based boundaries of lymph nodal levels in the neck, and in particular the clinical relevance of the delineation of sublevels IIa and IIb in case of selective radiation therapy (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: To validate the radiologically defined level contours, <b>clips</b> were <b>positioned</b> intraoperatively at the level boundaries defined by surgical anatomy. In 10 consecutive patients, clips were placed, at the time of a neck dissection being performed, at the most cranial border of the neck. Anterior-posterior and lateral X-ray films were obtained intraoperatively. Next, in 3 patients, neck levels were contoured on preoperative contrast-enhanced CT scans according to the international consensus guidelines. From each of these 3 patients, an intraoperative CT scan was also obtained, with clips placed at the surgical-anatomy-based level boundaries. The preoperative (CT-based) and intraoperative (surgery-defined) CT scans were matched. RESULTS: Clips placed at the most cranial part of the neck lined up at the caudal part of the transverse process of the cervical vertebra C-I. The posterior border of surgical level IIa (spinal accessory nerve [SAN]) did not match with the posterior border of CT-based level IIa (internal jugular vein [IJV]). Other surgical boundaries and CT-based contours were in good agreement. CONCLUSIONS: The cranial border of the neck, i. e., the cranial border of level IIa/IIb, corresponds to the caudal edge of the lateral process of C-I. Except for the posterior border between level IIa and level IIb, a perfect match was observed between the other surgical-clip-identified levels II-V boundaries (surgical-anatomy) and the CT-based delineation contours. It is argued that (1) because of the parotid gland overlapping part of level II, and (2) the frequent infestation of occult metastatic cells in the lymph channels around the IJV, the division of level II into radiologic sublevels IIa and IIb may not be relevant. Sparing of, for example, the ipsilateral parotid gland in selective RT can even be a treacherous undertaking with respect to regional tumor control. In contrast, the surgeon's reasoning for preserving the surgical sublevel IIb is that the morbidity associated with dissection of the supraspinal accessory nerve compartment of level II is reduced, whereas there is evidence from the surgical literature that no extra risk for regional tumor control is observed. Therefore, in selective neck dissections, the division into surgical sublevels IIa/IIb makes sense...|$|R

While the patient is immobilised in the treatment chair and keeps looking at a fixation light, <b>clip</b> and eye <b>positions</b> can be determined with a digital X amp; 64979;ray system providing orthogonal images. The clip projections derived from the treatment plan are superimposed with the present X ray images for position control. By the correction of chair and fixation light coordinates the patient is repositioned until both actual and target clip projections match with each other. In order to avoid a time consuming trial and error correction approach, a novel procedure has been implemented in the image processing software that compares both projections with each other. By automatically calculating the necessary corrections of chair and light coordinates it is aimed to facilitate adjustment to the final treatment position. Results Perpendicular X ray views provided precise patient positioning with an accuracy of below 0. 3 mm. By use of the automated procedure, the mean positioning time could be reduced. Discussion and Conclusions To date, the installation of an on amp; 64979;site digital X ray system for patient positioning is unique in proton therapy. Reduced positioning time due {{to the use of}} image processing to full capacity makes therapy more tolerable for the patient and may result in higher patient throughput...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the long-term results of the iris clip lens in senile aphakia. It is not intended to discuss the many different forms of intraocular lens im-plants. Ophthalmic surgeons are well aware of the discouraging short- and long-term failure rate when contact lenses are used to correct aphakia, and this has stimulated renewed interest in intraocular lens implants in both Europe and America. Bonnet, Massin, and Gerhard (I 966), reviewing 308 adult unilateral aphakics, found that after IO years only 20 per cent. were still wearing their contact lens. Mills and Lewis (197 I), reviewing I 32 patients who had been fitted with scleral contact lenses between I 961 and I 966 inclusive, found at the end of I 968 that 46 per cent. were no longer wearing their contact lenses, although nine had worn the contact lens successfully before cataract extraction on the second eye. Despite this, the authors concluded that the insertion of the intraocular lens as a primary procedure is not indicated in patients, who, at the time of preoperative assessment, seem suitable for contact lens fitting. Martin Walker (1968), in a 5 -year survey of 74 patients for whom contact lenses were authorized, found that only 3 I were still wearing their contact lens at the time of the review. It is difficult to convince a unilaterally aphakic patient, who has good vision in his phakic eye and is unable to tolerate a contact lens, that the operation that he has undergone is a success, even if he has useful visual function in the aphakic eye.

40|$|Background and Purpose Proton {{therapy for}} uveal {{melanoma}} provides high conformal dose {{application to the}} target volume and, thus, an optimal saving of the organs at risk nearby. Treatment planning is done with the model based treatment planning system EYEPLAN. Tumor reconstruction is based only on a fundus composite, which often leads to an overestimation of the clinical target volume CTV. The purpose was to exploit MRI on trial in a proton therapy planning system by using the novel image based treatment planning system OCTOPUS. Patients and Methods Ten patients with uveal melanomas received both a high resolution planning CT and MRI of the eye. MR examinations were made with an eye coil. EYEPLAN requires eye geometry data for modeling, and tantalum marker <b>clips</b> for submillimeter <b>positioning</b> and additional information from ultrasound and 3 D imaging. By contrast, OCTOPUS provides the full integration of 3 D imaging e. g., CT, MRI. CTVs were delineated in each slice. For all patients, CTVs EYEPLAN vs. OCTOPUS were compared intraindividually. Results OCTOPUS planning led to a mean reduction of the target volume {{by a factor of}} 1. 7 T 1 weighted [T 1 w] and 2. 2 T 2 w without compromising safety. The corresponding field size could be scaled down on average by a factor of 1. 2 T 1 w and 1. 4 T 2 w, respectively. Conclusion Compared with the conventional EYEPLAN, MRI based treatment planning of ocular tumors with OCTOPUS could be a powerful tool for reducing the CTV and, consequently, the treatment volume and the field size. This might be translated into a better patient compliance during treatment and a decreased late toxicity. Key Words Proton therapy Uveal melanoma Radiotherapy EYEPLAN OCTOPU...|$|R
40|$|Usually {{the word}} {{conversion}} implies conversion from a laparoscopic procedure {{to an open}} procedure to solve complications occurring during laparoscopy. In this article we report a conversion from an open procedure to a laparoscopic one, to treat a vascular complication that occurred during an orchiectomy performed in open surgery. A 2 -year-old boy came to our center for a right orchiectomy. The clinical history of this baby showed {{the presence of a}} right atrophic testis positioned in the medial part of the inguinal canal, a finding also confirmed by ultrasonography. One of our residents performed a right orchiectomy via an open inguinal procedure. After removing the testis, and before ligating the inner spermatic vessels {{at the level of the}} internal inguinal ring, the forceps that held the vessels was inadvertently opened, causing a contraction of the spermatic vessels. Since we were unable to identify the vessels and achieve hemostasis via the inguinal opening, a conversion to laparoscopic surgery was decided. A 10 -mm 0 ° optics was introduced through an umbilical trocar and revealed a large retroperitoneal hematoma along both the inner spermatic vessels and the deferential vessels, for about 3 – 4 cm from the internal inguinal ring. Two 5 -mm trocars were positioned in triangulation and hemostasis was achieved by <b>positioning</b> <b>clips</b> on the vessels at the level of internal inguinal ring and proximally to the hematoma. Surgery lasted 1 hour; the laparoscopic procedure, 25 minutes. The baby was discharged 2 days after surgery. At a 9 -month follow-up the clinical and ultrasonographical evaluation was normal. This case clearly shows the usefulness of laparoscopy in pediatric surgery, as well as to solve complications due to open surgery. We think that nowadays the use of laparoscopy should be considered indispensable by every pediatric surgical team...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: Recent {{prospective}} {{studies have}} explored the partial breast irradiation (PBI) {{for patients with}} early-stage breast cancer using different technical approaches. The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore feasibility, tumor control and acute and late toxicity of a specific hypo-fractionated 3 D-CRT when treating postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer with partial breast irradiation, using five fractions in five consecutive days. Materials and Methods: Ten patients, aged ≥ 70 underwent breast conservative surgery for invasive breast carcinoma with a complete microscopic resection; no lymphovascular invasion was found and negative axillary node status was assessed. Metal <b>clips</b> were <b>positioned</b> in the surgical bed at the time of surgery. All of the patients provided an informed consent for breast irradiation. Seven patients received Tamoxifen. Of the ten patients, five were treated for left breast disease, and five for right breast disease. The dose fractionation schedule was 3000 cGy delivered to the isocenter in 5 fractions (600 cGy/fr) using 6 MV photons. According to the linear quadratic model and an α/β ratio of 4 Gy this prescription is equivalent to 50 Gy in a standard 2 -Gy fractionation schedule. Patients were treated in the supine position. A comercial breast board was used as immobilization device in order to keep the arms of the patient raised. The clinical target volume (CTV) was drawn with a uniform 1 -cm three-dimensional margin around the surgical clips. The CTV was limited to 3 mm from the skin surface and 3 mm from the lung-chest wall interface. A three-dimensional margin was added to the CTV to obtain the planning target volume (PTV). The ipsilateral and controlateral breast, the ipsilateral and controlateral lung, heart and spinal cord were contoured as organs at risk (OAR). The treatment was developed using Precise Plan Treatment Planning System and four no-coplanar fields. The constraints used have been: uninvolved breast (ipsilateral breast-PTV) : V 15 ≤ 50 %; heart: V 3 ≤ 10 %; ipsilateral lung: V 10 ≤ 20 %; controlateral lung: V 5 ≤ 10 % and controlateral breast: maximum dose ≤ 1 Gy. We required PTV coverage of ≥ 90 %. Patient set-up was verified every day before treatment using portal images. No tumour bed boost was delivered. Clinical assessments of early normal tissue reaction were carried out every day during radiotherapy and 10 days after the end of the treatment. After radiotherapy, we visited all patients every 3 months during the first 2 years and every six month thereafter. Frontal and lateral pictures of the breast were taken on the first day of treatment (baseline), at the end of treatment, 10 days after the end of treatment and at the first follow-up. Any change in breast appearance compared with the baseline picture was scored on a four-point RTOG for acute and late radiation morbidity scoring scale. Results: No local or distant recurrences was observed and then confirmed by mammograms performed every year and breast ultrasound performed every six months. For acute and late toxicity, only 2 patients developed acute effects at the end of the treatment. Conclusion: The clinical outcomes observed in ten patients demonstrate a good feasibility of the schedule adopted both in terms of tumour control and acute and late toxicity, with good cosmetics results. Long term follow-up and a large number of patients will be needed for full evaluation...|$|R
