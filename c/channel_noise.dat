In the case of communication of information over a noisy channel, this abstract concept was made concrete in 1948 by Claude Shannon in his paper [...] "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", in which [...] "information" [...] is thought of as a set of possible messages, where the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and then to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error, in spite of the <b>channel</b> <b>noise.</b> Shannon's main result, the noisy-channel coding theorem showed that, in the limit of many channel uses, the rate of information that is asymptotically achievable is equal to the channel capacity, a quantity dependent merely on the statistics of the channel over which the messages are sent.|$|E

Introduction Recently, it has been recognized that the combination of a long low density paritycheck(LDPC) code[1] and the sum-product algorithm gives near capacity performance for the additive white Gaussian channel with reasonable decoding complexity[2].
