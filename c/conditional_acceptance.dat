500|$|By early morning, Michael was proclaimed as [...] "Emperor Michael II" [...] to Russian {{troops and}} in cities {{throughout}} Russia, but his accession was not universally welcomed. While some units cheered and swore {{allegiance to the}} new Emperor, others remained indifferent. The newly formed Provisional Government had not agreed to Michael's succession. When Michael awoke that morning, he discovered not only that his brother had abdicated in his favour, as Nicholas had not informed him previously, but also that a delegation from the Duma would visit him at Putyatina's apartment in a few hours' time. The meeting with Duma President Rodzianko, the new Prime Minister Prince Lvov and other ministers, including Pavel Milyukov and Alexander Kerensky, lasted all morning. Putyatina laid on a lunch, and in the afternoon two lawyers (Baron Nolde and Vladimir Nabokov) were called to the apartment to draft a manifesto for Michael to sign. The legal position was complicated as {{the legitimacy of the}} government, whether Nicholas had the right to remove his son from the succession and whether Michael actually was Emperor were all open to question. After further discussion, and several drafts, the meeting settled on a declaration of <b>conditional</b> <b>acceptance</b> as an appropriate form of words.

60|$|Mr. Gladstone {{immediately}} {{informed the}} Queen (Feb. 15) that viewing {{the likelihood of}} early and sanguinary actions, Lord Kimberley thought that the receipt of such an overture at such a juncture, although its terms were inadmissible, made it a duty to examine whether it afforded any hope of settlement. The cabinet were still more strongly inclined towards coming to terms. Any other decision would have broken up the government, for {{on at least one}} division in the House on Transvaal affairs Mr. Bright and Mr. Chamberlain, along with three other ministers not in the cabinet, had abstained from voting. Colley was directed (Feb. 16) to inform the Boers that on their desisting from armed opposition, the government would be ready to send commissioners to develop a scheme of settlement, and that meanwhile if this proposal were accepted, the English general was authorised to agree to the suspension of hostilities. This was in substance a <b>conditional</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the Boer overture.(24) On the same day the general was told from the war office that, as respected the interval before receiving a reply from Mr. Kruger, the government did not bind his discretion, but “we are anxious for your making arrangements to avoid effusion of blood.” The spirit of these instructions was clear. A week later (Feb. 23) the general showed that he understood this, for he wrote to Mr. Childers that “he would not without strong reason undertake any operation likely to bring on another engagement, until Kruger’s reply was received.”(25) If he had only stood firm to this, a tragedy would have been averted.|$|E

Mrs Merdle also, as a leading lady rich in distinction, elegance, grace, and beauty, he mentioned in very laudatory terms. He felt it his duty to remark (he was sure a gentleman of Mr Sparkler's fine sense would interpret him with all delicacy), {{that he could not}} consider this proposal definitely determined on, until he should have had the privilege of holding some correspondence with Mr Merdle; and of ascertaining it to be so far accordant with the views of that eminent gentleman as that his (Mr Dorrit's) daughter would be received on that footing which her station in life and her dowry and expectations warranted him in requiring that she should maintain in what he trusted he might be allowed, without the appearance of being mercenary, to call the Eye of the Great World. While saying this, which his character as a gentleman of some little station, and his character as a father, equally demanded of him, {{he would not}} be so diplomatic as to conceal that the proposal remained in hopeful abeyance and under <b>conditional</b> <b>acceptance,</b> and that he thanked Mr Sparkler for the compliment rendered to himself and to his family. He concluded with some further and more general observations on the--ha--character of an independent gentleman, and the--hum--character of a possibly too partial and admiring parent. To sum the whole up shortly, he received Mr Sparkler's offer very much as he would have received three or four half-crowns from him in the days that were gone.|$|E

5000|$|Rev. Allen {{traveled}} to Maryland in 1767, arriving {{with a letter}} from Lord Baltimore directing the governor to give him whatever he wished in the province. An arranged change of rectorships allowed Allen to obtain the living of St. Anne's parish in Annapolis, and he became the chaplain for and a drinking buddy of Governor Horatio Sharpe. [...] Rev. Allen also soon secured the living at St. James Herring Bay, although having such dual positions was illegal in the colony at the time, his plan to rent out the glebe flouted the vestry's <b>conditional</b> <b>acceptance,</b> and his remark that the £300/yr living could barely pay his alcohol budget inflamed many. Allen gave up the position at St. Anne's (but not St. James) when he secured the most lucrative parish in the colony, All Saints Church in Frederick, Maryland (worth £1000 sterling annually), after the early death of the scholarly incumbent, Rev.

50|$|As {{early as}} April 1803 Laussat {{reported}} to his government {{that he was}} beginning to find his position difficult. It does appear that, {{as a result of his}} own personality as much as the force of circumstances, he managed to alienate all parties, even the most rabid Republicans. The Royalists and émigrés saw in him merely the agent of a hated government. His relations with the official classes also gradually grew unpleasant. Laussat attributed this to the influence of the Marquès de Casa Calvo, who arrived in May as the Spanish Commissioner for the transfer of the Province. The power struggle between Burthe and Laussat begun on the voyage from France escalated, representing the rivalry between military and civilian authority. Each refused to recognise the jurisdictian of the other, and the Spanish Governor Salcedo openly received Burthe as if he were a representative of the French government, and allowing him to inspect barracks and hospitals, an action guaranteed to alienate Laussat still further. The animosity between the two Frenchmen became increasingly public, with both parties indulging in disgraceful behaviour, including deliberately organising rival dinner parties and competing for prominent guests. Matters came to a head when both men invited the official Vinache to dinner on 14 July 1803; when Vinache only gave <b>conditional</b> <b>acceptance</b> of Burthe's invitation, Laussat claims that Burthe attempted to place Vinache under arrest. Vinache complained of this to Laussat, with the result that Laussat informed Casa Calvo that he was issuing a warrant demanding Burthe’s arrest and return to France. (This warrant survives in the collection of Laussat's published papers.) However the Spaniard would not recognize Laussat's rights to make such a demand: he took the ground that, until the Province was actually transferred to France, Spanish authority prevailed.|$|E
