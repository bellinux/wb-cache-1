[...] He also opposed the extension of degree granting powers (which were only granted to universities at the time) to colleges, advocated against the inclusion of education in the General Agreement on Trade in Services and Free Trade Agreement of the Americas, and unsuccessfully lobbied the City of Edmonton to stop assessing property taxes on university residences. [...] He expanded the Students' Union's involvement in environmental issues - creating a Students' Union environmental office, spearheading an energy audit of the Students' Union's building, passing an ethical buying and purchasing policy, helping to open a Women's Centre on campus, and founding a <b>car</b> <b>pool</b> registry.

2500|$|As {{a result}} of his {{reputation}} within the industry, Zemeckis had trouble finding work in the early 1980s, though he and Gale kept busy. They wrote scripts for other directors, including <b>Car</b> <b>Pool</b> for Brian De Palma and Growing Up for Spielberg; neither ended up getting made. Another Zemeckis-Gale project, about a teenager who accidentally travels back in time to the 1950s, was turned down by every major studio. The director was jobless until Michael Douglas hired him in 1984 to film Romancing the Stone. A romantic adventure starring Douglas and Kathleen Turner, Romancing was expected to flop (to the point that, after viewing a rough cut of the film, the producers of the then-in-the-works Cocoon fired Zemeckis as director), but the film became a sleeper hit. [...] While working on Romancing the Stone, Zemeckis met composer Alan Silvestri, who has scored all of his subsequent pictures.|$|E
2500|$|The {{refrigerated}} {{rail car}} (refrigerated van or refrigerator car), {{along with the}} dense railroad network, became an exceedingly important link between the marketplace and the farm allowing for a national opportunity rather than a just a regional one. Before {{the invention of the}} refrigerated rail car it was impossible to ship perishable food products long distances. The beef packing industry made the first demand push for refrigeration cars. The railroad companies were slow to adopt this new invention because of their heavy investments in cattle cars, stockyards, and feedlots. [...] Refrigeration cars were also complex and costly compared to other rail cars, which also slowed the adoption of the refrigerated rail car. [...] After the slow adoption of the refrigerated car, the beef packing industry dominated the refrigerated rail car business with their ability to control ice plants and the setting of icing fees. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated that in 1916 over sixty-nine percent of the cattle killed in the country was done in plants involved in interstate trade. [...] The same companies that were also involved in the meat trade later implemented refrigerated transport to include vegetables and fruit. [...] The meat packing companies had much of the expensive machinery, such as refrigerated cars, and cold storage facilities that allowed for them to effectively distribute all types of perishable goods. [...] During World War I, a national refrigerator <b>car</b> <b>pool</b> was established by the United States Administration to deal with problem of idle cars and was later continued after the war. [...] The idle car problem was the problem of refrigeration cars sitting pointlessly in between seasonal harvests. [...] This meant that very expensive cars sat in rail yards for {{a good portion of the}} year while making no revenue for the car’s owner. [...] The <b>car</b> <b>pool</b> was a system where cars were distributed to areas as crops matured ensuring maximum use of the cars. Refrigerated rail cars moved eastward from vineyards, orchards, fields, and gardens in western states to satisfy Americas consuming market in the east. [...] The refrigerated car made it possible to transport perishable crops hundreds and even thousands of miles. The most noticeable effect the car gave was a regional specialization of vegetables and fruits. The refrigeration rail car was widely used for the transportation of perishable goods up until the 1950s. [...] By the 1960s the nation's interstate highway system was adequately complete allowing for trucks to carry the majority of the perishable food loads and to push out the old system of the refrigerated rail cars.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{deals with}} the use of the stated preference technique (SP) and transport demand modelling to analyse travel mode choice behaviour for commuting urban trips in Palermo, Italy. The principal aim of the study was the calibration of a demand model to forecast the modal split of the urban transport demand, allowing for the possibility of using innovative transport systems like car sharing and <b>car</b> <b>pooling.</b> In order to estimate the demand model parameters a specific survey was carried out inside the urban area of Palermo. The survey focused on the morning rush hour and involved mainly employees, selfemployed workers and students (about 500 respondents) whose final destination is located within the historical centre of the city. The questionnaires contained a stated preference experiment regarding the choice between four different transport alternatives: private <b>car,</b> <b>car</b> <b>pooling,</b> <b>car</b> sharing and public transport. A random utility model was developed by using data resulting from the SP experiment. We found out that, for the specific case of Palermo, the multinomial logit proved to be the best urban transport demand model, even if the choice set contained three car alternatives. We identified as main attributes affecting mode choice behaviour the one-way trip travel time and cost, the parking time, the number of cars available to each household member, the alternative specific attributes for the car option and the car sharing one. The model was applied to analyse the potential demand for car sharing and <b>car</b> <b>pooling</b> in Palermo, under a future scenario characterized by several policy actions for limiting private transport use. The analysis highlighted that the car club market share could increase up to the 10...|$|R
