5|$|In medieval England {{there was}} no <b>clear</b> <b>separation</b> between the king's {{household}} and the treasury. The main sources of royal income were the royal estates, feudal rights (such as feudal aids or feudal reliefs, which derived from the king's position as a feudal overlord), taxation, and fees and other profits from the judicial courts. In 1130, the records of revenues paid into the treasury show that about 40% came from royal estates, 16% from feudal rights, 14% from taxes, and 12% from the judicial courts. By 1194 revenue from the land came to about 37% of the total, about 25% came from feudal rights, taxation raised about 15%, and income from judicial sources about 11%.|$|E

On May 18, Moshe Dayan, who had been born in Degania, was given command of all forces in the area, after having been charged with creating a commando battalion in the 8th Brigade just a day before. A company of reinforcements from the Gadna program was allocated, along with 3 PIATs. Other reinforcements {{came in the form of}} a company from the Yiftach Brigade and another company of paramilitaries from villages in the Lower Galilee and the Jezreel Valley. The Palmach counterattack on the police station on the night of May 18 gave the Israeli forces an additional day to prepare defense and attack plans.|$|E

McMaster, who urged a more direct debate between civilians and the military on defense policy and actions, and Summers, who argued for a <b>clear</b> <b>separation</b> between civilians and the military, both pointed out controversies over the proper roles of civilian and military leaders.|$|E

The consulting firm Mercer has for many years ranked Zürich as a city with the highest quality of life in the world.

Other Swiss cities, Bern and Geneva, were also listed among the top ten. Zürich is also ranked the sixth most expensive city in the world. In 2008, Zürich was ranked ninth.

25|$|By early 1992, {{the search}} was on for a good byte stream {{encoding}} of multi-byte character sets. The draft ISO 10646 standard contained a non-required annex called UTF-1 that provided a byte stream encoding of its 32-bit code points. This encoding was not satisfactory on performance grounds, among other problems, and the biggest problem was probably {{that it did not}} have a <b>clear</b> <b>separation</b> between ASCII and non-ASCII: new UTF-1 tools would be backward compatible with ASCII-encoded text, but UTF-1-encoded text could confuse existing code expecting ASCII (or extended ASCII), because it could contain continuation bytes in the range 0x21–0x7E that meant something else in ASCII, e.g., 0x2F for '/', the Unix path directory separator, and this example is reflected in the name and introductory text of its replacement. The table below was derived from a textual description in the annex.|$|E
25|$|In some {{countries}} the radical tendency is {{a variant of}} liberalism. Sometimes it is less doctrinaire and more moderate; other times it is more extreme. In Victorian era Britain the Radicals {{were part of the}} Liberal coalition, but often rebelled when the more traditional Whigs in that coalition resisted democratic reforms. In other countries, these left-wing liberals have formed their own radical parties with various names, e.g. in Switzerland and Germany (Freisinn), Bulgaria, Denmark, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands but also Argentina (Radical Civic Union), Chile and Paraguay. This does not mean that all radical parties were formed by left-wing liberals. In the French political literature it is normal to make a <b>clear</b> <b>separation</b> between liberalism and radicalism in France. In Serbia both radicalism and liberalism have had their distinctiveness during the 19th century, with the Radical Party being the dominant political party throughout the entire multi-parliamentary period before the unification of Yugoslavia. It had cracked in 1903 when the Independent Radical Party had left, leaving the old People's Radical Party straying far from liberalism and into right-wing nationalism and conservatism. The Independents had created the Democratic Party, whereas the Radicals of today are a far-right political group.|$|E
30|$|After {{digestion}} of the non-poly(3 -HB) biomass, {{the polymer}} sedimented to the ground. However, sedimentation proceeded slowly, and the polymer did not sediment completely.

The much faster sedimentation of the polymer was accompanied by a <b>clearer</b> <b>separation.</b> Consequently, the sedimented poly(3 HB) could be decanted from the supernatant much easier. About 90 % of the supernatant could be removed by decanting, so that 10 % of the initial volume was left to be centrifuged.|$|R

500|$|The mature mRNA {{finds its}} way to a ribosome, where it gets translated. In prokaryotic cells, which have no nuclear compartment, the {{processes}} of transcription and translation may be linked together without <b>clear</b> <b>separation.</b> [...] In eukaryotic cells, the site of transcription (the cell nucleus) is usually separated from the site of translation (the cytoplasm), so the mRNA must be transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it can be bound by ribosomes. [...] The ribosome reads the mRNA triplet codons, usually beginning with an AUG (adenine−uracil−guanine), or initiator methionine codon downstream of the ribosome binding site. [...] Complexes of initiation factors and elongation factors bring aminoacylated transfer RNAs (tRNAs) into the ribosome-mRNA complex, matching the codon in the mRNA to the anti-codon on the tRNA. Each tRNA bears the appropriate amino acid residue to add to the polypeptide chain being synthesised. [...] As the amino acids get linked into the growing peptide chain, the chain begins folding into the correct conformation. Translation ends with a stop codon which may be a UAA, UGA, or UAG triplet.|$|E

Van der Weyden's symbolism was far more nuanced than Campin's but not as dense as van Eyck's. According to Harbison, van der Weyden incorporated his symbols so carefully, and in such an exquisite manner, that [...] "Neither the mystical union that results in his work, nor his reality itself for that matter, seems capable of being rationally analyzed, explained or reconstructed." [...] His treatment of architectural details, niches, colour and space is presented in such an inexplicable manner that [...] "the particular objects or people we see before us have suddenly, jarringly, become symbols with religious truth".|$|E
