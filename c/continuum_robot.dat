In this paper, we investigate the dexterity of three <b>continuum</b> <b>robots</b> combining both mechanisms. Indices based {{on the concept of}} orientability are introduced to analyze the distribution of the dexterity. A Monte Carlo method is used to calculate the dexterity distribution across the workspace. Particularly, directional dexterity indices are put forward to describe the dexterity along different axes. Results imply that evenly allocating degrees of freedom (DOFs) among the segments achieves the best workspace and dexterity. Otherwise, assigning more DOFs to the proximal segment tends to enlarge the workspace and adding more DOFs to the distal segment tends to improve the dexterity. In addition, the dexterity along different axes can vary significantly and thus requires special attention when applying the robot to specific surgical procedures...|$|R

40|$|Continuum robots {{have been}} the subject of {{extensive}} research due to their potential use in a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose a new <b>continuum</b> <b>robot</b> with three backbones, and provide a unified analytic method for the kinematics and dynamics of a multiple‐backbone <b>continuum</b> <b>robot.</b> The robot achieves actuation by independently pulling three backbones to carry out a bending motion of two‐degrees‐of‐freedom (DoF).

40|$|International audience— This paper {{presents}} a {{development of a}} new method dedicated to the modeling and control of <b>Continuum</b> <b>Robots,</b> based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) using quasi-static assumption. The modeling relies on a discretization of the <b>continuum</b> <b>robots</b> using 6 DoFs Frames along the structure of the robot that is compatible with the modeling of a sequence of rigid vertebras. When the robot's structure relies on rods with constant sections, internal forces are computed with beam elements, placed between two adjacent frames, that applies forces and torques. In the opposite, when the robot is composed of a complex shape deformable backbone separated by the rigid vertebras, a domain decomposition strategy is used to obtain an equivalent stiffness between two vertebras using volumetric FEM. In both cases, for solving the whole robot model and inverting it in real-time, the numerical method takes advantage of the serial nature of <b>continuum</b> <b>robots,</b> using a Block-Tri-Diagonal solver. The factor of improvement in the computation time reaches several order of magnitude compared to a classical FEM model, while keeping a good precision.

40|$|Robust and {{efficient}} tracking of <b>continuum</b> <b>robots</b> {{is important for}} improving patient safety during space-confined minimally invasive surgery, however, {{it has been a}} particularly challenging task for researchers. In this paper, we present a novel tracking scheme by fusing fiber Bragg grating (FBG) shape sensing and stereo vision to estimate the position of <b>continuum</b> <b>robots.</b> Previous visual tracking easily suffers from the lack of robustness and leads to failure, while the FBG shape sensor can only reconstruct the local shape with integral cumulative error. The proposed fusion is anticipated to compensate for their shortcomings and improve the tracking accuracy. To verify its effectiveness, the robots&# 39; centerline is recognized by morphology operation and reconstructed by stereo matching algorithm. The shape obtained by FBG sensor is transformed into distal tip position with respect to the camera coordinate system through previously calibrated registration matrices. An experimental platform was set up and repeated tracking experiments were carried out. The accuracy estimated by averaging the absolute positioning errors between shape sensing and stereo vision is 0. 67 ± 0. 65 mm, 0. 41 ± 0. 25 mm, 0. 72 ± 0. 43 mm for x, y and z, respectively.
