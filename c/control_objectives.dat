50|$|The SDLC phases {{serve as}} a {{programmatic}} guide to project activity and provide a flexible but consistent way to conduct projects to a depth matching {{the scope of the}} project. Each of the SDLC phase objectives are described in this section with key deliverables, a description of recommended tasks, and a summary of related <b>control</b> <b>objectives</b> for effective management. It is critical for the project manager to establish and monitor <b>control</b> <b>objectives</b> during each SDLC phase while executing projects. <b>Control</b> <b>objectives</b> help to provide a clear statement of the desired result or purpose and should be used throughout the entire SDLC process. <b>Control</b> <b>objectives</b> can be grouped into major categories (domains), and relate to the SDLC phases as shown in the figure.|$|E

For this scenario, we propose a bounded control law which can provably preserve the connectivity of the multi-robot system over time even in the presence of any desired bounded <b>control</b> <b>objective.</b> Furthermore, we characterize the effects of the connectivity control term on the collective <b>control</b> <b>objective,</b> in terms of robustness of the desired <b>control</b> <b>objective</b> to the disturbance of the connectivity, by resorting to the set Input- to-State Stability framework (set-ISS). For the validation of the proposed bounded connectivity control law we consider the encirclement problem as an example of collective control ob- jective. Simulations are provided to corroborate the theoretical results...|$|R

50|$|Around {{this time}} EDP {{auditors}} formed the Electronic Data Processing Auditors Association (EDPAA). The {{goal of the}} association was to produce guidelines, procedures and standards for EDP audits. In 1977, {{the first edition of}} <b>Control</b> <b>Objectives</b> was published. This publication is now known as <b>Control</b> <b>Objectives</b> for Information and related Technology (CobiT). CobiT is the set of generally accepted IT <b>control</b> <b>objectives</b> for IT auditors. In 1994, EDPAA changed its name to Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA). The period from the late 1960s through today has seen rapid changes in technology from the microcomputer and networking to the internet and with these changes came some major events that change IT auditing forever.|$|E

A vaccination control law based on a static-state feedback linearization strategy is developed for achieving such a <b>control</b> <b>objective.</b> This technique requires a nonlinear coordinate transformation, based on the theory of Lie derivatives [23], in the system representation.|$|R

5000|$|In {{business}} and accounting, information technology controls (or IT controls) are specific activities performed by persons or systems {{designed to ensure}} that business objectives are met. They are a subset of an enterprise's internal control. IT <b>control</b> <b>objectives</b> relate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and the overall management of the IT function of the business enterprise. IT controls are often described in two categories: IT general controls (ITGC) and IT application controls. ITGC include controls over the Information Technology (IT) environment, computer operations, access to programs and data, program development and program changes. IT application controls refer to transaction processing controls, sometimes called [...] "input-processing-output" [...] controls. Information technology controls have been given increased prominence in corporations listed in the United States by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The COBIT Framework (<b>Control</b> <b>Objectives</b> for Information Technology) is a widely used framework promulgated by the IT Governance Institute, which defines a variety of ITGC and application <b>control</b> <b>objectives</b> and recommended evaluation approaches. IT departments in organizations are often led by a Chief Information Officer (CIO), {{who is responsible for}} ensuring effective information technology controls are utilized.|$|E
