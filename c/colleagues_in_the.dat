5|$|After his censure, McCarthy {{continued}} senatorial duties {{for another}} {{two and a half}} years, but his career as a major public figure had been unmistakably ruined. His <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate avoided him; his speeches on the Senate floor were delivered to a near-empty chamber or were received with conspicuous displays of inattention.|$|E
5|$|Brunel died in 1859, {{without seeing}} the {{completion}} of the bridge. His <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Institution of Civil Engineers felt that completion of the Bridge would be a fitting memorial, and started to raise new funds. In 1860, Brunel's Hungerford suspension bridge over the Thames in London was demolished {{to make way for a}} new railway bridge to Charing Cross railway station. Its chains were purchased for use at Clifton.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 11 September 1867, police arrested two men found {{loitering}} in Oak Street, Shudehill, suspecting them of planning to rob a shop. Both were charged under the Vagrancy Act and held in custody. The Manchester police were initially unaware of their identities, until their <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Irish police identified them as Kelly and Deasy.|$|E

5|$|The name Pluto, {{after the}} god of the underworld, was {{proposed}} by Venetia Burney (1918–2009), an eleven-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England, who was interested in classical mythology. She suggested it in a conversation with her grandfather Falconer Madan, a former librarian at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Library, who passed the name to astronomy professor Herbert Hall Turner, who cabled it to <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E
5|$|As {{dozens of}} newly {{unemployed}} professors began searching for positions outside of Germany, their <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States sought {{to provide assistance}} and job opportunities for them. Albert Einstein and Hermann Weyl were appointed by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, while others worked to find a sponsor required for legal immigration. Noether was contacted by representatives of two educational institutions, Bryn Mawr College in the United States and Somerville College at the University of Oxford in England. After a series of negotiations with the Rockefeller Foundation, a grant to Bryn Mawr was approved for Noether and she took a position there, starting in late 1933.|$|E
5|$|By the 3rd century, Romanised Illyrians and Thracians, mostly primipilares {{and their}} descendants, came to {{dominate}} the army's senior officer echelons. Finally, the Danubian officer-class seized {{control of the state}} itself. In 268, the emperor Gallienus (ruled 260–68) was overthrown by a coup d'état organised by a clique of Danubian senior officers, including his successors Claudius II Gothicus and Aurelian (270–75). They and their successors Probus (276–82) and Diocletian (ruled 284–305) and his <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tetrarchy formed a sort of self-perpetuating military junta of Danubian officers who were born in the same provinces (several in the same city, Sirmium, a major legionary base in Moesia Superior) and/or had served in the same regiments.|$|E

5|$|Chambers {{reflected}} {{on drug use}} in athletics {{in an interview with}} Olympic gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent for the BBC's Inside Sport programme. Chambers claimed there would always be athletes using performance-enhancing drugs because drug testers did not keep pace with advances in science and that athletes who took drugs had an immense advantage over those who remained clean. Chambers was roundly condemned for his comments in the interview by both the press and his former <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> athletics world, including Sir Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Sebastian Coe, although former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell supported Chambers' claims.|$|E
5|$|In late 1991, Syrian {{authorities}} arrested Nayyouf's {{wife and}} young {{daughter in a}} crackdown on members of the CDF in order to pressure Nayyouf to give himself up. On 10 January 1992, Nayyouf surrendered to authorities. After his arrest, Nayyouf was tortured at the Palestine Branch of Syrian Military Intelligence. Many of Nayyouf's <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CDF were also arrested, and at least 17 were tried alongside Nayyouf by the Syrian Supreme State Security Court (SSSC) in proceedings lasting from 29 February to 27 March 1992.|$|E
5|$|Mallory {{resigned}} {{after the}} Confederate government had fled from Richmond {{at the end}} of the war, and he and several of his <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cabinet were imprisoned and charged with treason. After more than a year in prison, the public mood had softened, and he was granted parole by President Andrew Johnson. He returned to Florida, where he supported his family in his final years by again practicing law. Unable to hold elective office by the terms of his parole, he continued to make his opinions known by writing letters to newspapers. His health began to deteriorate, although he was not incapacitated until the very end. He died on November 9, 1873.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 {{study showed}} that holes in the skulls of several {{specimens}} that were previously explained by intraspecific attacks might {{have been caused by}} Trichomonas-like parasites that commonly infect avians. Further evidence of intraspecific attack were found by Joseph Peterson and his <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> juvenile Tyrannosaurus nicknamed Jane. Peterson and his team found that Jane's skull showed healed puncture wounds on the upper jaw and snout which they believe came from another juvenile Tyrannosaurus. Subsequent CT scans of Jane's skull would further confirm the team's hypothesis, showing that the puncture wounds came from a traumatic injury and that there was subsequent healing. The team would also state that Jane's injuries were structurally different from the parasite-induced lesions found in Sue and that Jane's injuries were on her face whereas the parasite that infected Sue caused lesions to the lower jaw.|$|E
5|$|Honório Hermeto {{departed}} for Montevideo, {{the capital of}} Uruguay, on 23 October. He chose José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco) to assist him. Paranhos was a brilliant {{young man who had}} once been a Liberal Party member and protégé of the disgraced Aureliano Coutinho. This surprising choice was a clear signal from Honório Hermeto to his <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cabinet of his independence. On 21 November, Honório Hermeto signed a treaty of alliance with Uruguay and the rebel Argentine provinces of Entre Ríos and Corrientes. On 3 February 1852, the allies defeated Rosas, who fled to the United Kingdom. As a reward for his role, the Emperor granted Honório Hermeto the title of Visconde de Paraná (Viscount of Paraná) in July 1852. The title was derived from the Paraná River, a tributary of the Río de la Plata, upon which free passage rights for Brazilian shipping was secured after Rosas' downfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumstances}} {{regarding how}} Ray came into {{possession of the}} Gretzky T206 Wagner have been shrouded in mystery. He tried to avoid answering any questions regarding the matter but, in a 2001 interview, claimed to have received it from a relative, whose name he did not disclose. Inside the memorabilia community, there was speculation that the card had been cut from a printing sheet during the deal made with Mastro. Mastro has told <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> memorabilia circuit that he purchased the card from a printer, which was not Ray's profession. Ray personally stated that Mastro might {{have been doing this}} to prevent others from trying to trace the card. Some also claim that Mastro bought the card from Sevchuk, not Ray.|$|E

5|$|The rebel {{leaders were}} quickly rounded up. A rebel leader {{by the name}} of Jack Straw was {{captured}} in London and executed. John Ball was caught in Coventry, tried in St Albans, and executed on 15 July. Grindecobbe was also tried and executed in St Albans. John Wrawe was tried in London; he probably gave evidence against 24 of his <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope of a pardon, but was sentenced to be executed by being hanged, drawn and quartered on 6 May 1382. Sir Roger Bacon was probably arrested before the final battle in Norfolk, and was tried and imprisoned in the Tower of London before finally being pardoned by the Crown. As of September 1381, Thomas Ingleby of Bridgwater had successfully evaded the authorities.|$|E
5|$|However, the Americans {{were not}} {{counting}} on Thảo {{and his fellow}} Catholic Phát trying to seize power on an explicitly religious platform, claiming fidelity to slain former Catholic President Ngô Đình Diệm and promising to recall Khiêm from the US to lead the new regime. This caused alarm among the Buddhist majority, who had campaigned heavily against Diệm's discriminatory religious policies {{in the months leading}} up to his ouster in November 1963. Although they wanted Khánh gone, the Americans did not want Thảo and Phát to succeed, so they sought out Kỳ and Thi in an attempt to have them defeat the original coup and then depose Khánh. During the initial attack, Thảo and Phát tried to capture both Khánh and Kỳ, but both men escaped narrowly, although some of their <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Armed Forces Council were arrested. Although the rebels were able to take control of Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the largest in the country and the military headquarters of South Vietnam, Kỳ was able to regroup quickly and retain control of the nearby Bien Hoa Air Base, using it to mobilize air power and stop the rebel advance with threats of bombing. Late in the night, Thảo and Phát met Kỳ in a meeting arranged by the Americans, where an agreement was reached for the coup to be ended in return for Khánh's ouster. By early next morning, the bloodless military action was over as Thảo and Phát went into hiding, and the junta voted to sack their leader Khánh, who was absent on a military inspection tour, thinking that Kỳ and Thi were on his side.|$|E
