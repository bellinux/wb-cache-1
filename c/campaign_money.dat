5|$|Jackson {{and wife}} Sandi signed plea {{agreements}} in early February 2013. Jackson Jr. agreed {{to plead guilty}} to charges of fraud, conspiracy, making false statements, mail fraud, wire fraud, and criminal forfeiture—having used about $750,000 in <b>campaign</b> <b>money</b> for over 3000 personal purchases that included a Michael Jackson fedora and cashmere capes.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, Paul filed {{to run for}} {{re-election}} to his Senate seat in 2016. Had he become the Republican presidential (or vice-presidential) nominee, state law would prohibit him from simultaneously running {{for re-election}}. In March 2014, the Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate passed {{a bill that would}} allow Paul to run for both offices, but the Democratic-controlled Kentucky House of Representatives declined to take it up. Paul spent his own <b>campaign</b> <b>money</b> in the 2014 legislative elections, helping Republican candidates for the State House in the hopes of flipping the chamber, thus allowing the legislature to pass the bill (Democratic Governor Steve Beshear's veto can be overridden with a simple majority). However, the Democrats retained their 54–46 majority in the State House. Paul has since given his support to the idea that the Kentucky Republican Party could decide to hold a caucus rather than a primary, potentially giving Paul more time to decide whether he should run for U.S. Senator or continue a potential bid for President.|$|E
5|$|While the {{committees}} are established by formal Senate rules, {{there are a}} number of caucuses that exercise significant influence over the legislative process. The most powerful of these are the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Caucus, each of which has a leader and a whip, referred to as a majority and minority leader and whip. As Democrats currently control a majority of seats in the Senate, their leader is referred to as the Majority Leader, and their caucus is able to influence legislation to a greater extent than the Republican caucus. The Majority Leader and Minority leader are responsible for managing their party's participation in debate on the floor. Party caucuses also raise and distribute <b>campaign</b> <b>money</b> to assist their candidates. The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and Women Legislators of Maryland, caucuses of African-American and female Senators respectively, also play prominent roles in the Senate.|$|E

25|$|During the election, Townsend {{was criticized}} for her choice of running mate; she picked retired Admiral Charles R. Larson, a novice {{politician}} who had switched parties {{only a few weeks}} before. The Townsend campaign was also hurt by the unpopularity of Governor Parris Glendening, who had implemented a redistricting proposal that was overturned by Maryland's highest court. Townsend's popularity continued to fall when it was reported that much of her <b>campaign</b> <b>money</b> was given by out-of-state donors; Ehrlich remained on the attack while the lieutenant governor's poll numbers declined.|$|E
25|$|The Liberals {{were also}} {{hampered}} by {{their inability to}} raise <b>campaign</b> <b>money</b> competitively after Chrétien passed a bill in 2003 which banned corporate donations, even though the Liberals had enjoyed by far the lion's share of this funding due to the then-divided opposition parties. It {{has been suggested that}} Chrétien, who had done nothing about election financing for his 10 years in office, could be seen as the idealist as he retired, while his rival and successor Paul Martin would have the burden of having to fight an election under the strict new rules.|$|E
500|$|Edward {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of a castle at Harlech, one of seven built across North Wales {{in the wake of the}} 1282 <b>campaign.</b> <b>Money</b> to pay for the initial phase arrived in mid-May and carpenters and 35 stonemasons were dispatched in June and July to commence work. By the winter of 1283, the first [...] of the inner walls had been constructed, allowing the castle to be defended in the event of an attack, and a small, planned town had been founded alongside the castle. John de Bonvillars was appointed the constable of the castle in 1285; after his death in 1287 his wife, Agnes, took up the role until 1290.|$|E

500|$|When Halliday died in June, {{parliament}} was in recess. As {{a result}} of this, a writ could not be issued until parliament reconvened in the winter. This extended the election campaign to run for six months, causing major disruption to the wool trade in the town. In his History of Taunton, Joshua Toulmin reported that {{the length of the}} campaigning allowed [...] "the display of every manoeuvre, and the exertion of every power, by which the parties could counteract each other's views." [...] A lot of money was spent {{on both sides of the}} election; in addition to the £3,000 which Maxwell said he was willing to spend, the government put forward £3,675 of secret service money for his campaign. Both men had plates and mugs made which were given free to the voters, generally full of food and drink. A number of delft plates bearing the enscription [...] "Sir John Pole for ever" [...] still exist, and one such plate sold for over £2,000 in 2011. A drinking glass with a similar inscription is housed at the British Museum in London. The public houses became aligned to one of the two candidates, and much of the <b>campaign</b> <b>money</b> was placed into these to gain their support. Toulmin lamented that [...] "the houses of entertainment were kept open during all this time; [...] habits of idleness and licentiousness were formed." [...] In a letter to Lord Sackville, Maxwell wrote that the election campaign involved [...] "a great deal of smoking, some drinking, and kissing some hundreds of women." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in {{the third}} quarter, after second quarter {{fundraising}} totals increased only slightly to over $760,000, Huckabee criticized the top tier Republicans for wastefully spending their <b>campaign</b> <b>money</b> and said that [...] "I really don't want some folks {{in charge of the}} federal treasury if the way they're burning <b>campaign</b> <b>money</b> is indicative of how they would burn taxpayer money" ...|$|E

50|$|On 4 October 2012 it was {{announced}} that Money had joined Cambridge United as head coach, with the then current manager, Jez George, returning to his role as Director of Football. Cambridge finished 14th {{at the end of the}} 2012-13 campaign before undertaking a significant rebuild of the squad. A host of players arrived in readiness for the new <b>campaign,</b> <b>Money's</b> first full season in charge, and Cambridge were unbeaten after the first 16 games of the Conference season. Though that run was eventually ended by Southport, Cambridge remained in the top two for the remainder of the season - winning the FA Trophy along the way. Money then led the club to promotion via the play-offs, a 2-1 victory over Gateshead at Wembley securing a return to the Football League after a nine-year absence.|$|R

2500|$|Huckabee {{generated}} {{even better}} reviews from {{his performance in}} the May 15, 2007 Republican Presidential Debates.

Many supporters of the FairTax plan were also impressed by Huckabee's unfettered support of that proposed policy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bill passed}} and {{was signed by}} Governor Terry Bradstad on March 2, 2012. According to the DesMoines Register, [...] "The National Institute on Money in State Politics has found that almost 10 percent of the $8.9 million Governor Branstad raised in his most recent {{campaign}} came from the agriculture industry. And almost $8,000 – more than one-fourth of all the <b>campaign</b> <b>money</b> raised in 2010 by Sen.

2500|$|In 2003 and 2004, Lewis, then {{chairman}} of the defense appropriations subcommittee, was in a fierce competition for the chairmanship. [...] The Republican leadership had begun assigning chairmanships in part based on how much <b>campaign</b> <b>money</b> a member had raised for other members. Mr. Lewis and his rivals for the post, Representatives Ralph Regula of Ohio and Harold Rogers of Kentucky, each began a fund-raising blitz. And each concentrated on the industry that had benefited from spending appropriated by their subcommittee, which in Mr. Lewis's case was defense.|$|E

2500|$|During the 30 years {{following}} the Civil War the Republican Party was largely the party of New Castle County industrialists and the African-American population.
