Method Twenty-eight male collegiate soccer players were assigned to either a 9 -week <b>concentration</b> <b>grid</b> training condition or a control condition. <b>Concentration</b> <b>grid</b> training consisted of 9 weekly meetings with an experienced sport psychologist with practice assignments in between sessions. During the first, fifth and final weeks of the experiment all participants completed a battery of concentration tasks (a visual search task, a video observation task and a <b>concentration</b> <b>grid).</b> Results A series of MANOVA's and ANOVA's indicated no significant interaction effects indicating that the concentration training group did not improve to a greater extent than the control group in any measure of concentration. Conclusions The findings highlight the need for further research examining the efficacy of the <b>concentration</b> <b>grid</b> exercise using different training protocols and different dependent measures. In addition, the results also indicate support for sport psychologists who have urged caution with the use of the <b>concentration</b> <b>grid</b> exercise in applied sport psychology...|$|E

Domestic chemical loads in waste water are estimated using gridded population data. River flows are estimated by combining predicted runoff with topographically derived flow direction.

No differences were observed between groups on measures of emotion and self-efficacy.

The main purposes of the work are to show the importance of atmospheric dispersion modelling for epidemiological studies and to discuss advantages and disadvantages of the different models used. For this study the emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans and biphenyls (PCDD/F) from the municipal waste incinerators of Modena (Italy, Case A) and of Reggio Emilia (Italy, Case B) have been considered. Ground-level (0 – 10 m) concentrations of PCDD/F over the city of Modena were computed using the ARIA Industry dispersion model for the period from 1 October, 2005 to 1 October, 2006. Ground-level concentrations of PCDD/F over the city of Reggio Emilia were computed using the WinDimula 3. 0 model for the years 1999, 2000 and 2001, and for the period from 1 July, 2005 to 30 June, 2006.

In this research, we examined the selectivity of and insulin release from two boronic acids (2 -formyl- 3 -thienylboronic acid (FTBA) and 4 -formylphenylboronic acid (FPBA)) to glucose when conjugated to chitosan as nanoparticles. Adsorption of glucose to BA: chitosan conjugates was dose-dependent up to 1 : 1 at 35 and 42 % for FPBA and FTBA respectively but the FTBA conjugates adsorbed more glucose and fructose at respective FPBA ratios. The affinity of both BA conjugates to glucose decreased with increase in BA ratio. On the other hand, the affinity of both BA conjugates for fructose decreased from ratio 1 : 1 to 2 : 1 then rose again at 3 : 1. Insulin release from FPBA nanoparticles (FPBAINP) and FTBA nanoparticles (FTBAINP) were both concentration-dependent within glyceamically relevant values (1 - 3 mg/ml glucose and 0. 002 mg/ml fructose). Furthermore, the total amounts of insulin released from FPBAINP in both the media were higher than from FTBAINP.

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{in this paper}} is to provide a simple, conceptual, framework for describing the metalnonmetal (MNM) transition in systems that can be viewed in terms of a lattice of impurity states embedded in a host matrix. From an extensive analysis of experimental data, we find that a particular (scaled) form of the Mott criterion, nc 13 aH*= 0. 26 ± 0. 05, is applicable over a range of approximately 1010 in critical densities (nc) and approximately 600 in Bohr radii (aH*). Here aH* is defined as an appropriate radius associated with a realistic wave function for the localized state in the low-electron-density regime. The systems of interest range from tight-binding (Frenkel) metal-atom states in the rare-gas solids to shallow (Wannier-like) states in the group-IV a semiconductors and indium antimonide. The possible origins of this apparent universality have been formulated from a consideration of Berggren's interpretation of the Hubbard model for the transition, as applied to condensed systems. In essence, it appears that the role of the host matrix in the phenomenon of MNM transition is important primarily {{in the sense that it}} determines the form of the radial distribution of the (localized) impurity state. We suggest that once these matrix-induced modifications to the (gas-phase) donor state are taken into account, the ensuing transition to the metallic state (at finite impurity concentrations) reduces to a one-electron problem in a suitably renormalized <b>concentration</b> <b>grid.</b> © 1978 The American Physical Society...|$|E

Some of the ATDMs used the same and others different meteorological data consistent with their normal operating practices. There were four global meteorological analyses data sets available and two regional high-resolution analyses. Not all of the ATDMs {{were able to use}} all of the meteorological data combinations. The ATDMs were configured identically as much as possible with respect to the release duration, release height, <b>concentration</b> <b>grid</b> size, and averaging time. However, each ATDM retained its unique treatment of the vertical velocity field and the wet and dry deposition, one of the largest uncertainties in these calculations. There were 18 ATDM-meteorology combinations available for evaluation. The deposition results showed that even when using the same meteorological analysis, each ATDM can produce quite different deposition patterns. The better calculations in terms of both deposition and air concentration were associated with the smoother ATDM deposition patterns. The best model with respect to the deposition was not always the best model with respect to air concentrations. The use of high-resolution mesoscale analyses improved ATDM performance; however, high-resolution precipitation analyses did not improve ATDM predictions. Although some ATDMs could be identified as better performers for either deposition or air concentration calculations, overall, the ensemble mean of a subset of better performing members provided more consistent results for both types of calculations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Statistical {{trajectory}} {{analysis has}} been widely used to identify potential source regions for chemically and radiatively important chemical species in the atmosphere. The most widely used method is a statistical source–receptor model developed by Stohl (1996), of which the underlying principle is that elevated concentrations at an observation site are proportion-ally related to both the average concentrations on a specific grid cell where the observed air mass has been passing over and the residence time staying over that grid cell.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} geographical analysis {{of air pollution}} in the Tucson region. Image processing, geographic information system (GIS), climatological, and statistical tools are used to develop and analyze air pollution-related databases. These databases are then {{used in conjunction with}} a limited number of spatial measurements of ozone concentrations to create accurate and theoretically sound ground-level ozone maps. High spatial resolution, gridded, multi-temporal, atmospheric emissions inventories (EIs) of ozone precursor chemical (i. e. volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ)) emissions are initially developed. GIS-driven "top-down" and "bottom-up" methods are employed to create anthropogenic VOC and NOx emissions inventories while satellite imagery and field surveys are employed to create biogenic VOC (BVOC) emissions inventories. Accounting for approximately 50 % of the anthropogenic emissions, on-road vehicles are the dominant anthropogenic source. The forest and desert lands emit nearly all of the BVOCs within the entire Tucson region while exotic trees such as eucalyptus, pine, and palm emit most of the BVOCs within the City of Tucson. Relationships between VOC and NOₓ emissions, atmospheric conditions, and ambient ozone levels are determined by examining spatio-temporal variations in ozone levels, temporal variations in VOC and NOₓ emissions and atmospheric conditions, atmospheric conditions which are conducive to elevated ozone levels. In addition, the likelihood of ozone transport from Phoenix to Tucson is assessed. The highest ozone levels occur at "rural," downwind monitors, occur in August, and occur during the early afternoon hours. Atmospheric conditions conducive to elevated concentrations differ between the months while inter-city ozone transport is most likely to occur in June. Pooled, cross-sectional, times series, regression models are developed with the aid of cluster analysis and principal components analysis to spatially predict daily maximum 1 -hr and 8 -hr average ozone <b>concentrations.</b> <b>Gridded,</b> multi-temporal estimates of VOCs and NOₓ emissions are the primary predictor variables in the regression models.

Traditional simulations utilize uniformly spaced rectangular computational grids to perform the smoke simulation. Various changes had been proposed to improve different aspects of the simulation, including level of details, memory usage and simulation speed. In this thesis, I propose a novel computational grid that improves upon the level of details as well as memory usage. I propose a frustum aligned grid that takes advantage of the viewing camera because details are most important in the area close to the camera. A frustum aligned grid reduces the amount of grid points necessary to cover the whole domain by placing a high <b>concentration</b> of <b>grid</b> points near the camera while having sparse grid points away from the camera. By using a larger number of grid lines in the direction parallel to the camera and fewer grid lines in the direction perpendicular to the camera, high level of details using a smaller amount of memory can be achieved.

The boiler model is a 3 D problem that involves turbulence, combustion, radiation in addition to NOx modeling. The 3 D computational fluid dynamic model is developed using Fluent simulation package, where {{the volume of the}} furnace was divided into 371000 control volumes with more <b>concentration</b> of <b>grids</b> near solid walls and regions of high property gradients. The model provides calculations of the 3 D temperature distribution as well as the rate of formation of the NOx pollutant, enabling a better understanding on how and where NOx are produced. The boiler was simulated under various operating conditions. The generated data is then used to train and test the developed neural network softsensors for emission prediction based on the conventional process variable measurements. The softsensors were constructed using Polynomial Networks (PolyNets), which are a special class of the recently introduced Functional Networks. PolyNets compose complex Neural Networks from simple transfer polynomials with weights that are computed efficiently by ordinary least-squares. The performance of the proposed PolyNet softsensor is evaluated in detail in the paper and compared with the traditional MLP neural networks. It is shown that PolyNets achieve better accurac...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{cardiovascular}} {{and stroke}} mortality rates in Arkansas {{are among the}} highest in the USA. The annual trends of stroke and cardiovascular mortality are barely correlated to smoking cessation; while the prevalence of risk factors such as obesity; cholesterol and hypertension increased over the 1979 – 2007 period. The study determined the effect of chronic exposure to PM 2. 5 on non-accidental; cardiovascular; stroke and lung cancer mortality in Arkansas over the 2000 – 2010 period using the World Health Organization’s log-linear health impact model. County chronic exposures to PM 2. 5 were computed by averaging spatially-resolved <b>gridded</b> <b>concentrations</b> using PM 2. 5 observations. A spatial uniformity was observed for PM 2. 5 mass levels indicating that chronic exposures were comparable throughout the state. The reduction of PM 2. 5 mass levels by 3. 0 μg/m 3 between 2000 and 2010 explained a significant fraction of the declining mortality. The effect was more pronounced in southern and eastern rural Arkansas as compared to the rest of the state. This study provides evidence that the implementation of air pollution regulations ha...|$|R
40|$|Reverse ElectroDialysis (RED) {{is a very}} {{promising}} technology allowing the electrochemical potential difference of a salinity gradient to be directly converted into electric energy. Fluid dynamics optimization of the thin channels to be devoted for the RED process is still an open problem. The present preliminary work focuses on the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of the flow and concentration fields in these channels. In particular three different configurations were investigated: a channel unprovided with a spacer and two different spacer (made of either overlapped filaments or woven filaments) filled channels. Two passive scalars were transported along with the water in order to evaluate <b>concentration</b> polarization phenomena. <b>Grid</b> topology and computational domain effects were also addressed. Results show that: (i) the grid topology affects the concentration boundary layer; (ii) {{the adoption of a}} small computational domain along with periodic boundary conditions provide the same flow field obtained with a wider domain; (iii) the woven spacer filled channel is the best compromise between pressure drops and concentration polarization. Future works will address the inclusion of electrical effects along with the migrative transport of the ions in the channel...|$|R
50|$|The cost {{of added}} {{physical}} complexity is a corresponding increase in computational cost, {{so much so}} that a full three-dimensional explicit treatment of combustion in wildland fuels by direct numerical simulation (DNS) at scales relevant for atmospheric modeling does not exist, is beyond current supercomputers, and does not currently make sense to do because of the limited skill of weather models at spatial resolution under 1 km. Consequently, even these more complex models parameterize the fire in some way, for example, papers by Clark use equations developed by Rothermel for the USDA forest service to calculate local fire spread rates using fire-modified local winds. And, although FIRETEC and WFDS carry prognostic conservation equations for the reacting fuel and oxygen <b>concentrations,</b> the computational <b>grid</b> cannot be fine enough to resolve the reaction rate-limiting mixing of fuel and oxygen, so approximations must be made concerning the subgrid-scale temperature distribution or the combustion reaction rates themselves. These models also are too small-scale to interact with a weather model, so the fluid motions use a computational fluid dynamics model confined in a box much smaller than the typical wildfire.|$|R
40|$|Formation {{of ozone}} and organic aerosol in {{continental}} atmospheres {{depends on whether}} isoprene emitted by vegetation is oxidized by the high-NO x pathway (where peroxy radicals react with NO) or by low-NO x pathways (where peroxy radicals react by alternate channels, mostly with HO 2). We used mixed layer observations from the SEAC 4 RS aircraft campaign over the Southeast US to test {{the ability of the}} GEOS-Chem chemical transport model at different grid resolutions (0. 25 ° [*]×[*]  0. 3125 °, 2 ° [*]×[*]  2. 5 °, 4 ° [*]×[*]  5 °) to simulate this chemistry under high-isoprene, variable-NO x conditions. Observations of isoprene and NO x over the Southeast US show a negative correlation, reflecting the spatial segregation of emissions; this negative correlation is captured in the model at 0. 25 ° [*]×[*]  0. 3125 ° resolution but not at coarser resolutions. As a result, less isoprene oxidation takes place by the high-NO x pathway in the model at 0. 25 ° [*]×[*]  0. 3125 ° resolution (54  %) than at coarser resolution (59  %). The cumulative probability distribution functions (CDFs) of NO x, isoprene, and ozone concentrations show little difference across model resolutions and good agreement with observations, while formaldehyde is overestimated at coarse resolution because excessive isoprene oxidation takes place by the high-NO x pathway with high formaldehyde yield. The good agreement of simulated and observed concentration variances implies that smaller-scale non-linearities (urban and power plant plumes) are not important on the regional scale. Correlations of simulated vs. observed concentrations do not improve with grid resolution because finer modes of variability are intrinsically more difficult to capture. Higher model resolution leads to decreased conversion of NO x to organic nitrates and increased conversion to nitric acid, with total reactive nitrogen oxides (NO y) changing little across model resolutions. Model concentrations in the lower free troposphere are also insensitive to grid resolution. The overall low sensitivity of modeled <b>concentrations</b> to <b>grid</b> resolution implies that coarse resolution is adequate when modeling continental boundary layer chemistry for global applications...|$|R
