40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{simulation}} of rotor oil pump is completed by using SC/Tetra under variable conditions, which obtains {{the distribution of}} pressure and velocity. The pressure in the outlet oil chamber rises with rotation of rotor which makes the space smaller and smaller. In the result of postprocessor the maximum pressure is 4. 3 Mpa. This paper also studies on the internal velocity field distribution of pump body and <b>pump</b> <b>cover.</b> By the chart of velocity vector, fluid exists obvious reflow phenomenon. This is because of effection of the rotor rotation. The maximum velocity mainly exists in <b>pump</b> <b>cover.</b> Futhermore, flow characteristic curve is compared with the experimental result. The result basically shows the correctness of numerical simulation...|$|R

40|$|For delivery, dosing and {{pressure}} control of fluids in mobile and stationary applications electromagnetically operated piston pumps are an established solution. The volume per stroke is exactly {{defined by the}} geometry. Nevertheless cavitation, more likely with the new fuel blends containing {{a high proportion of}} ethanol / 1 /, deteriorates the dosing precision of the liquid portion. One important criterion of precise metering is the transport of the liquids through the reciprocating piston pump without transferring bubbles. Especially, pumping in the range of vapour pressure of gasoline fuels implies challenges for precision. The objective of this work is revealing potential sources of reduced cavitation by optimising the design. For doing so, optical investigations have been applied. In addition to this, cavitation can be diminished controlling the piston’s travel externally. The second important item <b>covers</b> <b>pumping</b> of degenerated fluids even without negative effects on the pump’s performance. Up to now, wide, inefficient gaps or high force surplus are necessary. A new helix-design / 2 / has been investigated and built up {{in order to reduce the}} described effort. The effects coming with the helix allow a permanent rinsing of the stressed surfaces, leading to lubrication and lower temperature loads. The results are shown in simulation, fundamental tests and is validated in practical pump operation...|$|R

40|$|Women play a {{major role}} in {{domestic}} water management in areas where safe water and drainage are not available in the house. In these settings, women are typically responsible for collecting, storing, and using water and for disposing of wastewater (1, 2). Most studies of women’s water management and the health benefits of safe water and sanitation examine the effect of protected water sources, such as <b>covered</b> wells or <b>pumps,</b> and basic sanitation (3). However, water management may also be a health issue in large villages and periurban communities that are supplied with piped water but have inadequate sanitation or drainage facilities.

40|$|Many {{aquifers}} {{around the}} globe are located in coastal areas and are thus subjected to the seawater intrusion phenomenon. The growth of population in coastal areas and the conjugate increase in human, agricultural, and industrial activities have imposed an increasing demand for freshwater. This increase in water demand is often <b>covered</b> by extensive <b>pumping</b> of fresh groundwater, causing subsequent lowering of the water table (or piezometric head) and upsetting the dynamic balance between freshwater and saline water bodies. The classical result of such a development is seawater intrusion. This paper presents a review for the seawater intrusion phenomenon in coastal aquifers. The effect of pumping activities on the seawater intrusion in the Nile Delta aquifer of Egypt is investigated. It was concluded that any additional pumping should {{be located in the}} middle Delta and avoided in the eastern and western sides of the Delta...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The process CAD {{design is}} the key part for steel casting {{production}} in general foundry enterprises. Formerly, for those parts with PDF file from customers, especially foreign customers, the process CAD design was done just by 2 D casting process CAD system depending on AutoCAD system; so the designer must spend much time drawing part by AutoCAD according the PDF file which cause low efficiency. In this paper, a new process CAD design method is proposed based on PDF file {{in order to avoid}} drawing part by AutoCAD. Fist, the framework of process CAD design is constructed. Second, as the base part of process CAD design, the practical 2 D CAD frame is established. Third, the part drawing with PDF file is resolved to be displayed clearly through the Mupdf rendering engine. Finally, the casting processes design of two actual steel castings, including a <b>pump</b> <b>cover</b> casting and a large gear casting, are presented to illustrate this new process CAD design method...|$|R
