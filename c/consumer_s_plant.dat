40|$|This paper {{provides}} an alternative theory of price adjustment resting on consumer loss aversion {{in the price}} dimension. In line with prospect theory the perceived losses from price increases are weighted stronger in the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> utility function than the perceived gains resulting from price decreases of equal magnitude. Prices are evaluated relative to a certain reference price which is endogenous, sluggish and depends to the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> recent rational price expectations. Two key modeling implications arise: First, demand responses are more elastic for price increases than for price decreases and thus firms face a downward-sloping demand curve that is kinked at the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> reference price. Second, changes in the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> recent rational price expectations and hence in the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> reference price can alter demand through {{what we call the}} reference-price-updating effect. We incorporate this into an otherwise standard dynamic neoclassical model of monopolistic competition and analyze price and quantity reactions to various demand shocks. We find that although firms may change their prices flexibly, {{depending on the size of}} the shock the prices adjust more or less pronounced than in the standard monopoly model and that prices can even be rigid. Additionally, we find that the price adjustment is asymmetric with respect to shock size and sign and the current state of the business cycle, i. e. pricing is state-dependent...|$|R

We find that U. <b>S.</b> <b>plants</b> release less toxic emissions when their parent firm imports more from low-wage countries (LWCs). Consistent with the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, goods imported by U.

40|$|As food quality {{becomes more}} complex, <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> are tending {{to reduce their}} {{involvement}} in the food purchase decision- making process. Consequently, prices are becoming more significant as they represent an easy choice criterion when <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> have less information {{about the differences between}} the product and process quality inherent in food items (including environmental or social issues).

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} {{that supported the}} hypothesis that the mutation to the psbA plastid gene that confers S-triazine resistance (R) in Brassica napus also results in an altered diurnal pattern of photosynthetic carbon assimilation (A) relative to that of the susceptible (S) wild type, and that these patterns change over the ontogeny of a plant. Photosynthetic photon flux density, under closely controlled environmental conditions, was incrementally increased and decreased {{on either side of the}} midday maxima of 1150 to 1300 μmol quanta m− 2 s− 1. In all experiments, A approximately tracked the increasing and decreasing diurnal light levels. Younger (3 - to 4 -leaf) R plants had greater photosynthetic rates early and late in the diurnal light period, whereas those of <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> were greater during midday as well as during the photoperiod as a whole. These relative photosynthetic characteristics of R and <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> changed in several ways with ontogeny. As the plants aged during the vegetative phase of development, <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> gradually assimilated more carbon in the early, and then in the late, part of the day. At the end of the vegetative phase of development, R plant carbon assimilation was less relative to <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> at most times of the day, and was never greater. This relationship between the two biotypes dramatically changed with the onset of the reproductive phase (8 ½ to 9 ½ leaf) of plant development: R plants assimilated more carbon than <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> during all periods of the diurnal light period with the exception of the late part of the day. In addition to these differences in A, R plant stomatal function differed from that in <b>S</b> <b>plants.</b> R plant leaves were always cooler than <b>S</b> <b>plant</b> leaves under the same environmental and diurnal conditions. Correlated with this difference in leaf temperature were equal or greater total conductances to water vapor and intercellular CO 2 partial pressures in R compared to S leaves in most instances. These studies indicate a more complex pattern of photosynthetic carbon assimilation than previously observed. The photosynthetic superiority of one biotype relative to the other was a function of the time of day and the age of the plant. These studies also suggest that R plants may have an adaptive advantage over <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> in certain unfavorable ecological niches independent of the presence of S-triazine herbicides, such as cool, low-light environments early and late in the day, as well as late in the plants' development. This advantage could result in R biotypes appearing in populations of a species in greater numbers than plastidic mutation alone could cause...|$|R

40|$|It {{is not yet}} {{understood}} {{whether the}} implementation of traceability systems can contribute towards restoring consumer confidence in food quality and safety, {{one of the goals}} of the European Food Law. To date, little is known about how consumers perceive the role and potential impact of traceability within the supply chain. This paper aims to provide insight into how traceability information can offer guarantees of food quality and safety, and contribute towards increased consumer confidence. Data, collected in four EU countries, examines salient cognitions and attitudes that underpin consumer beliefs about product traceability that will influence their decision making. It will link traceability- related food attributes to perceived benefits (in terms of quality and safety) and important consumer values. Furthermore, variations between different <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> are examined to illustrate how the concepts of food safety and food quality may have different meanings and consequences in the various European countries.

40|$|Recently, Italian {{agriculture}} {{has been}} widely characterised by {{the increasing number of}} farms and land converting to organic farming. In the slow process of shifting from a "niche" to a broader consumption in the organic products market deep differences between conventional and organic production, distribution and consumption became evident. In such a context, the consumer's behaviour about organic products analysis transpires to be complex as it involves either social - economic and psychographic characteristics. In order to address this issue a research has been carried out in two steps: in the first one, a qualitative analysis step, 45 <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> of organic products were interviewed by phone using laddering techniques; then, in the second quantitative step, data from a 203 <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> sample, representative of a region of South of Italy, was analysed by means of a multinomial logit.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of hereditary endophytic fungi, {{and the effects}} on grass persistence strategies (i. e. relative investment in sexual reproduction and vegetative growth) under natural conditions may help to predict how some alpine ecosystems will respond to environmental change. Grass persistence and endophyte maintenance in host populations are closely related, but could become independent due to endophyte loss mechanisms. We used native grass and endophyte populations {{to test the hypothesis}} that fungal endophytes manipulate grass persistence strategies to secure endophyte maintenance in plant populations. Two conditions were required to verify this hypothesis: 1) the fungus caused alterations in host plant strategies; and 2) plant phenotypic changes induced by the fungal endophyte increased endophyte transmission. We compared symbiotic (S) and non-symbiotic (NS) persistence strategies of Festuca eskia (Poaceae), an alpine grass infected by the asexual form of the fungal endophyte Epichloë festucae. We characterised endophyte transmission efficiency, and described vegetative growth and sexual reproduction in a field population that naturally supports approximately 50 % <b>S</b> <b>plants.</b> We built a demographic model to estimate plant vegetative growth rates. A correlation between plant persistence strategy, and fungal maintenance was evaluated by increasing soil resource levels. Under natural conditions, <b>S</b> and NS <b>plants</b> exploited different persistence strategies in the same population; <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> exhibited greater vegetative growth than their NS counterparts, while maintaining the same reproductive output. In response to higher soil resource levels, <b>S</b> <b>plants</b> shifted in persistence strategies and phenology, whereas NS plants maintained the same strategies. Therefore, results suggested the fungal endophyte fine-tuned host persistence strategies according to soil resource level. Finally, we found no direct relationship between the changes induced by fungal endophyte and endophyte transmission. Consequently, fungal endophytes affected host persistence strategies, but did not directly increase endophyte transmission. 10 page(s...|$|R
