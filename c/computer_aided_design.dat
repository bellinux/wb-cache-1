In addition to Liberal Arts courses, students can take advanced placement biology, chemistry, physics, anatomy & physiology, forensic science, robotics, geometry, algebra 2, and calculus at the AEA. Students preparing for civil engineering and architecture careers can take pre-engineering, computer networking and <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> <b>design</b> (CAD) at the AEA.

5|$|Mathematics can {{be discerned}} {{in many of}} the arts, such as music, dance, painting, architecture, and sculpture. Each of these is richly {{associated}} with mathematics. Among the connections to the visual arts, mathematics can provide tools for artists, such as the rules of linear perspective as described by Brook Taylor and Johann Lambert, or the methods of descriptive geometry, now applied in software modelling of solids, dating back to Albrecht Dürer and Gaspard Monge. Artists from Luca Pacioli in the Middle Ages and Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer in the Renaissance have made use of and developed mathematical ideas in the pursuit of their artistic work. The use of perspective began, despite some embryonic usages in the architecture of Ancient Greece, with Italian painters such as Giotto in the 13th century; rules such as the vanishing point were first formulated by Brunelleschi in about 1413, his theory influencing Leonardo and Dürer. Isaac Newton's work on the optical spectrum influenced Goethe's Theory of Colours and in turn artists such as Philipp Otto Runge, J. M. W. Turner, the Pre-Raphaelites and Wassily Kandinsky. Artists may also choose to analyse the symmetry of a scene. Tools may be applied by mathematicians who are exploring art, or artists inspired by mathematics, such as M. C. Escher (inspired by H. S. M. Coxeter) and the architect Frank Gehry, who more tenuously argued that <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> <b>design</b> enabled him to express himself in a wholly new way.|$|E

25|$|A {{polygonal}} mesh {{is composed}} {{of a set of}} vertices, edges, and faces that specify the shape of a polyhedral object in 3D space. The surfaces of the phantom are defined by a large amount of polygonal meshes, most commonly triangles. The polygonal mesh has three remarkable advantages in developing whole-body phantoms. Firstly, mesh surfaces depicting human anatomy can be conveniently obtained from real patient images or commercial human anatomy mesh models. Secondly, the polygonal mesh-based phantom has considerable flexibility in adjusting and fine-tuning its geometry, allowing the simulation of very complex anatomies. Thirdly, many commercial <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> <b>design</b> (CAD) software, such as Rhinoceros, AutoCAD, Visualization Toolkit (VTK), provide built-in functions able to rapidly convert polygonal mesh into NURBS.|$|E

25|$|Solid {{modeling}} {{systems for}} <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> <b>design</b> {{offer a variety}} of methods for building objects from other objects, combination by Boolean operations being one of them. In this method the space in which objects exist is understood as a set S of voxels (the three-dimensional analogue of pixels in two-dimensional graphics) and shapes are defined as subsets of S, allowing objects to be combined as sets via union, intersection, etc. One obvious use is in building a complex shape from simple shapes simply as the union of the latter. Another use is in sculpting understood as removal of material: any grinding, milling, routing, or drilling operation that can be performed with physical machinery on physical materials can be simulated on the computer with the Boolean operation x∧¬y or x−y, which in set theory is set difference, remove the elements of y from those of x. Thus given two shapes one to be machined and the other the material to be removed, the result of machining the former to remove the latter is described simply as their set difference.|$|E
500|$|Digital {{camouflage}} {{provides a}} disruptive effect {{through the use}} of pixellated patterns at a range of scales, meaning that the camouflage helps to defeat observation at a range of distances. Such patterns were first developed during the Second World War, when Johann Georg Otto Schick designed a number of patterns for the Waffen-SS, combining micro- and macro-patterns in one scheme. The German Army developed the idea further in the 1970s into Flecktarn, which combines smaller shapes with dithering; this softens the edges of the large scale pattern, making the underlying objects harder to discern. Pixellated shapes pre-date <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> <b>design</b> by many years, already being used in Soviet Union experiments with camouflage patterns, such as [...] "TTsMKK" [...] developed in 1944 or 1945.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. This paper is a {{retrospective}} analysis {{of the development of}} an integrated curriculum in product design at Wolverhampton which brings together creative design, technology, materials, manufacture and computing. In the late 1980 s the Schools of Art and Design, Engineering, Technology and Computing decided to introduce what at that time was a new type of degree in product design with a multidisciplinary approach that drew from expertise across the institution. The BSc (Hons) in <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> product <b>design</b> which had its first student intake in 1989 aimed to develop a product designer with a richer blend of skills between design, technology and engineering, but which also put the student at the centre and developed a curriculum that fostered independent learning. Over the last decade a group of undergraduate honours awards have grown out of the successful <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> product <b>design</b> degree including a BA in industrial design, a BSc in <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> industrial <b>design,</b> and a BSc in <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> engineering <b>design.</b> This paper reflects on the evolution of this curriculum in design over the last 10 years, concentrating on the following innovative areas: 1. development of independent learning to foster academic and practical design skills 2. integrating the technological and creative elements in the design project work 3. meeting future design, technological, and sociological needs through curriculum development...|$|R
