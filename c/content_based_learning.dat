By our proposed adaptive e-learning framework, we attempt to bridge in the gap between pedagogy and technology, emerging in recent web-based learning environments.

Findings of the study indicate differences in performance between matched and non-matched students in one case of the study and in the other case, demonstrate no significant difference.

Such ways of second language learning not only increase the student's language skills, but also affect his cognitive development.

40|$|Abstract — Nowadays most of Internet users surfer from spam emails. Filtering {{technique}} {{is one of}} the effective methods which help us {{to get rid of the}} spam emails. One of the problems of filtering is that it cannot detect spam emails accurately when the concepts change or drift happens as time goes by. Therefore, it is required to handle concept drift accurately and quickly. This paper proposes a new algorithm for concept drift detection with three different levels; control, warning, and alarm level. The results show that the proposed algorithm can detect concept drift more accurately compared with the previously proposed ones. In addition, it can detect sudden concept changes more accurately.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} evidence {{given in}} support of English for Specific Academic Purposes (ESAP) over English for General Academic Purposes (Liyanage & Birch 2001), {{as well as more}} general arguments for <b>Content</b> <b>Based</b> Language <b>Learning</b> (CBLL) (Kasper 1994, 1997, Brinton et al. 1989, Song 2006). While there are now a number of studies that demonstrate the considerable potential of 'embedding' English Language Studies in the academic disciplines, the reasons behind its apparent advantages await further investigation. Aside from the challenges presented by the inherently collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of CBLL, this lack of any widely accepted rationale may in part account for the degree of hesitancy with which it has been embraced by the academic community. Researchers have proposed that successful outcomes of ESAP may reflect a neuro-cognitive or a sociology-of-learning dimension, or both (Kasper 1997, Grabe & Stoller 1997). This paper explores suggestions arising from theories of Knowledge Building (Scardamalia & Bereiter 2003) that argue that the development of disciplinary expertise is a motivational factor in successful outcomes in ESAP.

30|$|In this paper, we {{described}} the educational practices <b>based</b> on the <b>learning</b> support system we developed {{in our previous}} work. The system, which offers visualization of program behavior, supports learners to understand algorithms, and hence introducing these systems is expected to allow learners to cultivate an improved understanding. However, existing systems {{tend to focus on}} reproducing the entire flow of the algorithm behavior, which means {{that it is necessary to}} structure the contents of classes such that the properties of an algorithm such as the number of comparisons or swaps are taught. Furthermore, almost all of existing systems disallows variation in the teacher’s intent of instruction to accommodate the learners. Based on these considerations, we introduced the system developed in our previous work. Our system visualizes the target domain world according to the visualization policy defined by the teacher. We included <b>contents</b> <b>based</b> on discovery <b>learning</b> about the properties of algorithms in our classroom practices.

By formulating a utility (inverse of service delay) maximization problem, we propose a cache update algorithm based on spatio-temporal traffic demands. To account for the large number of contents, we propose a content clustering algorithm to group similar contents.

40|$|Poor {{integration}} of pedagogical and technological learning elements within {{teaching and learning}} methodologies may have substantial impacts {{on the effectiveness of}} learning. Although educational institutions are improving their courses, teaching and learning methodologies and assessment strategies with tailored approaches, their efforts at improvement tend to focus narrowly on academic results.

EOLib is operated in the Payload Ground Segment of TerraSAR-X. The main goal of EOLib is to provide semantic annotations of satellite image content and offer to the end user a semantic catalogue via a web user interface. Moreover, EOLib has more functionality such as searches based on image metadata and semantics, visual exploration of the image archives, metadata extraction, etc. The system consists of components such as a query engine, knowledge discovery in databases, visual data mining, epitome generation, and user services. EOLib is able to ingest a TerraSAR-X scene with 8000 × 8000 pixels in about three minutes.

40|$|With the new planned Sentinel missions, the {{availability}} of Earth Observation data is increasing everyday offering {{a larger number of}} applications that can be created using these data. Currently, three of the five missions were launched and they are delivering a wealth of data and imagery of the Earth's surface as, for example, the Sentinel- 1 carries an advanced radar instrument to provide an all-weather, day-and-night supply of Earth imagery. The second mission, the Sentinel- 2, carries an optical instrument payload that will sample 13 spectral bands at different resolutions. Even though, we count on tools for automated loading and visual exploration of the Sentinel data, we still face the problem of extracting relevant structures from the images, finding similar patterns in a scene, exploiting the data, and creating final user applications based on these processed data. In this paper, we present our approach for processing radar and multi-spectral Sentinel data. Our approach is mainly composed of three steps: 1) the generation of a data model that explains the information contained in a Sentinel product. The model is formed by primitive descriptors and metadata entries, 2) the storage of this model in a database system, 3) the semantic definition of the image <b>content</b> <b>based</b> on machine <b>learning</b> algorithms and relevance feedback methods. © (2016) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

The eLearning in Portugal {{as in many other}} countries is not yet so widely used as an alternative to other forms of training: as is the case of traditional classroom. This is because learners don’t identify their own learning style in the way the presentation of education content are done in the majority of eLearning material produced today, or not feel enough customization in the content to their own needs. This paper describes the design, development and implementation of the model of an adaptive course player that uses Kolb learning styles[1] and neural networks to model learners and dynamically generates navigation paths and layout adaptation. The system implements adaptation of individual recommendations and <b>content</b> adaptation <b>based</b> on <b>learning</b> styles, previous learner knowledge, learner’s progress and persistence of their own preferences. This is a ongoing work, and we are using our own experience producing eLearning content and an actual eLearning project to evolve the way difficult domain content can be presented to different individuals or stereotyped groups (similar conceptual understanding) with a disparity of objectives, different kind of professional roles, dissimilar previous knowledge and different context...|$|R

We have tried to present facts and concepts of science (both concrete and abstract) in a visually appealing manner without detracting from the <b>content.</b> Activity <b>based</b> <b>learning</b> is now accepted as the basis of science education. These activities should be regarded as a means for open-ended investigation rather than for verification of principles/content given in the textbook are has been designed to facilitate low cost activities and experiments using locally available materials. With a view to streamlining the activities, we have now segregated them into three groups: y I Do - activities to be done by an individual learner. y We Do - activities to be done by a group of learners. and y We Observe- activities to be demonstrated by the teacher. The third group of activities have a higher degree of difficulty or require careful handling as it may involve dealing with chemicals, electricity etc., The “More to know ” snippets in the text represents some unusual and interesting facts or information in which the students need not be examined. The evaluation section is nothing but another space for learning in a different manner. As the focus is on understanding, rote learning is to be discouraged thoroughly. Application of learnt ideas, problem solving skills and critical thinking is to be encouraged. There could be scope for more than one answer to a question, which should be acknowledged always.
