5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1879-1880, {{extended}} periods of extreme cold affected the Netherlands. Permafrost and temperatures down to minus 16 degrees Celsius led to distress among the citizens of Delft. In response, Matthes founded the Vereeniging voor Armenzorg (Association to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor),</b> helping regardless of religious or political beliefs. She prompted her husband to launch a Wintersnood-Commissie, which was led by him, his brother-in-law Arnold Kerdijk, and CEO-to-be Gerard Knuttel.|$|E
5|$|The 19th century saw major {{development}} in healthcare in Arbroath. In 1836 a dispensary {{was set up}} by public subscription to provide medical <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> In 1842 a typhus epidemic in the town {{led to the creation of}} a small fever ward to keep patients in isolation. The following year subscriptions began to be taken to develop this into Arbroath Infirmary, which opened in 1845, and moved to new premises in 1916.|$|E
5|$|In {{supporting}} Calvin's {{proposals for}} reforms, {{the council of}} Geneva passed the Ordonnances ecclésiastiques (Ecclesiastical Ordinances) on 20 November 1541. The ordinances defined four orders of ministerial function: pastors to preach and to administer the sacraments; doctors to instruct believers in the faith; elders to provide discipline; and deacons to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> and needy. They also called {{for the creation of}} the Consistoire (Consistory), an ecclesiastical court composed of the lay elders and the ministers. The city government retained the power to summon persons before the court, and the Consistory could judge only ecclesiastical matters having no civil jurisdiction. Originally, the court had the power to mete out sentences, with excommunication as its most severe penalty. The government contested this power and on 19 March 1543 the council decided that all sentencing would be carried out by the government.|$|E
5000|$|Progressive Christians {{believe that}} Christ came to [...] "save the lost and downtrodden," [...] and place {{emphasis}} on <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> whereas conservatives tend to preach moral principles, and stress <b>the</b> need <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lost and downtrodden to accept Jesus Christ {{as the only}} way to salvation in addition to <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b>|$|R

40|$|Since the psalms are religious, poetic, existential {{expressions}} of life, entailing both extreme joy and intense suffering, {{it stands to}} reason that poverty (in its literal sense and otherwise) would receive considerable attention. Focussing on material poverty and challenging the idea of a homogeneous view on poverty (e. g. Armenfr�mmigkeit) in the psalms, the diversity of views on poverty in the psalms is explored. Attention is paid to YHWH or God <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> <b>the</b> (Israelite) king as champion <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> <b>the</b> gods (heavenly assembly) (non) <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> in Zion theology, God as crusher of <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> and mutual human charity. The article concludes with some remarks regarding the possible present-day appropriation of the views in the psalms. Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: The article challenges the traditional notion on Armenfr�mmigkeit in the psalms. This is important for contexts where identifying with <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> are fed by selfish interest and actually feeds exploitation. It also propounds that various views on poverty exist, demanding creative and contextual applicable measures to combat poverty in the present-day world. </p...|$|R
5|$|During the English Civil War, the Royal Fort was {{considered}} the strongest part of Bristol's defences, and {{it was to the}} fort that the Royalists retreated when they found themselves under siege from the Parliamentarians. It fell to the parliamentary forces in 1645 and was subsequently demolished. St Nicholas's Almshouses were built in 1652 to provide <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> Several public houses were also built in this period, including the Llandoger Trow on King Street and the Hatchet Inn. More churches were built, including St Michael on the Mount Without. It served the St Michaels hill area, one of the first areas outside the city walls to be colonised by the wealthy merchants who were by then trying to escape the overcrowded and unhealthy conditions in the city centre. The city was by this time beginning to expand rapidly beyond its traditional city walls, and the surrounding villages were starting to become suburbs, such as the villages of Horfield and Brislington. Both had their own churches, the Church of the Holy Trinity with St Edmund and St Lukes respectively.|$|E

25|$|Paul {{says that}} when he entered medical {{practice}} in the early 1960s, before the Medicare and Medicaid programs were established, the poor and the elderly were hospitalized at about the same rates as they have been under Medicare and Medicaid in the 2000s, and that they received good care. He says further that in those days, doctors and hospitals provided cut-rate or free care to people who did not have health insurance – “every physician understood that he or she had a responsibility toward the less fortunate, and free medical <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> was the norm” – and that this was possible because healthcare costs were much lower. At a church charity hospital where he worked in his early years of practice, “nobody was turned away” for lack of ability to pay.|$|E
500|$|The poem {{consists}} of four stanzas, each with twelve lines. [...] Riley dedicated his poem [...] "to all the little ones," [...] which served as an introduction to draw the attention of his audience when read aloud. The alliteration, parallels, phonetic intensifiers and onomatopoeia add effects to the rhymes that become more detectable when read aloud. The exclamatory refrain ending each stanza is spoken with more emphasis. The poem is written {{in the first person}} and in a regular iambic meter. It begins by introducing Annie, and then sets a mood of excitement by describing the children eagerly gathering to hear her stories. The next three stanzas are each a story which Annie tells the children. Each story tells of a bad child who is snatched away by goblins and has an underlying moral which is announced in the final stanza, encouraging children to obey their parents and teachers, help their loved ones, and <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> and disadvantaged.|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Italian-American Giacomo Patri (1898–1978) {{produced}} {{his only}} wordless novel, the linocut White Collar.

[...] It also deals with controversial topics such as abortion, accessibility of health <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> and loss of Christian faith. [...] From 1948 to 1951, Canadian Laurence Hyde (1914–1987) produced his single wordless novel, the woodcut Southern Cross, in response to the American atomic tests in the Bikini Atoll. [...] The work tells of an American evacuation of an island for nuclear tests, where one family is left behind. [...] Polish-American Si Lewen's (1918–) first book, The Parade: A Story in 55 Drawings (1957), won praise from Albert Einstein for its anti-war message. [...] Canadian George Kuthan's Aphrodite's Cup (1964) is an erotic book drawn in an ancient Greek style. [...] In the early 21st century, Canadian George Walker made wordless woodcut novels, beginning with Book of Hours (2010), about the lives of those in the World Trade Center complex just before the September 11 attacks.|$|E
50|$|The monastic {{community}} was always quite small. In 1480, only the commander, the prior and six knights lived there. In {{keeping with the}} Rule of Life of the Order, the knights at the commandery were responsible <b>for</b> providing pastoral <b>care</b> {{to the people of}} the area, operating a pilgrims' hospital and <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> <b>The</b> commander of Münchenbuchsee often was also appointed the head of the Thunstetten Commandery.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} begun in 1575 {{adjacent}} to a 1528 hospital that <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> and disabled orphans.

500|$|Secular {{buildings}} include The Red Lodge, {{built in}} 1580 for John Yonge as a lodge {{for a larger}} house that once stood {{on the site of}} the present Colston Hall. It was subsequently added to in Georgian times and restored in the early 20th century. St Bartholomew's Hospital is a 12th-century town house which was incorporated into a monastery hospital founded in 1240 by Sir John la Warr, 2nd Baron De La Warr (...) , and became Bristol Grammar School from 1532 to 1767, and then Queen Elizabeth's Hospital 1767–1847. The round piers predate the hospital, and may come from an aisled hall, the earliest remains of domestic architecture in the city, which was then adapted to form the hospital chapel. Three 17th-century town houses which were attached to the hospital were incorporated into model workers' flats in 1865, and converted to offices in 1978. St Nicholas's Almshouses were built in 1652 to provide <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> Several public houses were also built in this period, including the Llandoger Trow on King Street and the Hatchet Inn.|$|E
500|$|Several {{instrumental}} {{leaders of}} soldiers' aid and relief organizations came from Massachusetts. These included Dorothea Dix, who had traveled {{across the nation}} working to promote proper <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> and insane before the war. After {{the outbreak of the}} war, she convinced the U.S. Army to establish a Women's Nursing Bureau on April 23, 1861 and became the first woman to head a federal government bureau. [...] Although army officials were dubious about the use of female nurses, Dix proceeded to recruit many women who had previously been serving as unorganized volunteers. One of her greatest challenges, given the biases of the era, was to demonstrate that women could serve as competently as men in army hospitals. Dix had a reputation for rejecting nurses who were too young or attractive, believing that patients and surgeons alike would not take them seriously. [...] U.S. Army surgeons often resented the nurses of Dix's bureau, claiming that they were obstinate and did not follow military protocol. [...] Despite such obstacles, Dix was successful at placing female nurses in hospitals throughout the North.|$|E
500|$|Bucer had ambitious {{goals in}} {{diffusing}} the Reformation throughout England. He was disappointed, therefore, when {{those in power}} failed to consult him in bringing about change. On learning about the custom of presenting a memorandum to the king every new year, he worked on a major treatise which he gave as a draft to his friend John Cheke on 21 October 1550. The [...] {{was the culmination of}} Bucer's many years of experience, a summary of his thought and theology that he described as his legacy. In it he urged Edward VI {{to take control of the}} English Reformation, and proposed that Parliament introduce fourteen laws of reform, covering both ecclesiastical and civil matters. [...] In his view the Reformation was not only concerned with the church, but in all areas of life. Noting the difficult social conditions in England, he promoted the role of deacons to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> and needy. [...] He described marriage as a social contract rather than a sacrament, hence he permitted divorce, a modern idea that was considered too advanced for its time. [...] He advocated the restructuring of economic and administrative systems with suggestions for improving industry, agriculture, and education. [...] His ideal society was distinctively authoritarian, with a strong emphasis on Christian discipline. [...] The De Regno Christi was never to be the charter of the English Reformation that Bucer intended: it was finally printed not in England but in Basel, in 1557.|$|E
