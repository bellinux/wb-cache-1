40|$|A precise optical {{method was}} {{developed}} for measuring the concentricity of a longitudinal hole in a cylinder relative to the outer cylindrical surface. The work was done to provide improved accuracy over existing methods for measuring the concentricity ofan optical fiber relative to the outer ferrule diameter in an optical connector. Fiber concentricity {{is very important for}} reliable coupling of high optical power densities from one connectorized fiber cable to another. The technique involves the use of a laser interferometer to measure the passage of the ferrule into and out of a light beam whose attenuated energy is measured simultaneously to high precision. Combined measurements of the passage of a precisely fit pin or fiber in the ferrule hole through the light beam allow the concentricity of the fiber hole to be measured relative to the outer ferrule diameter. Repeatability measurements were made under different experimental arrangements, with both a collimated light beam and a slightly convergent light beam. Depending on the particular arrangement, the standard deviation for <b>concentricity</b> <b>measurement</b> in a given plane of the ferrule ranged from 2. 37 microinches to 4. 19 microinches...|$|E
40|$|The {{insertion}} loss of fiber-optic components {{is one of}} the most important parameters that determine the performance of fiber-optic transmission systems. Some of the most widely used components in fiber optics systems are fiber optic connectors. To achieve a low loss connection between two optical fibers, precise and accurate alignment of their cores is essential. To achieve good quality alignment in a typical connector, high accuracy and precision must be maintained with respect to all connector ferrule geometrical parameters such as concentricity error, outside diameter, micro-hole diameter and end radius. Having an accurate measurement method for these parameters is a fundamental need for the connector manufacturing industry to asses and control their manufacturing processes. Up to now, the industry was unable to directly measure ferrule concentricity because all current standard test methods measure a combination of ferrule outside diameter roundness error and concentricity error. However, it is important to distinguish between concentricity error and roundness error because the ferrules are inserted into a ceramic sleeve that mostly accommodates the roundness error of the ferrule. At the same time, ferrule roundness error is an important parameter of the ferrule and it should not be ignored. A clear separation between the measurement of ferrule concentricity and roundness error would improve the <b>concentricity</b> <b>measurement</b> accuracy, resulting in better process controls and a subsequent reduction of connector {{insertion loss}} in the field. The new method proposed in this thesis, allows the concentricity error to be separated from the roundness error. The mechanical configuration of the method is identical to the standard surface reference method but more sophisticated analysis is employed. In the proposed method, the concentricity and roundness errors are calculated using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Because the frequency components generated by the DFT are orthogonal, the roundness and concentricity errors are also orthogonal when calculated by this method, and thus are separate. The proposed method will yield a more accurate measurement of installed concentricity while providing an accurate roundness error measurement at the same time. This method will not only improve the industry's measurement capability but it will also serve as an invaluable tool for process control. Subsequently, the insertion loss of fiber optic connectors will improve. Thus the ultimate goal of the work described in this thesis. is to reduce the loss in optical fiber systems...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objectives}} Clinical heart failure (HF) {{is associated with}} CKD and faster rates of kidney function decline. Whether subclinical abnormalities of cardiac structure are associated with faster kidney function decline is not known. The association between cardiac concentricity and kidney function decline was evaluated. Design, setting, participants, & measurements This is a longitudinal study of 3866 individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (2000 – 2007) who were free of clinical cardiovascular disease, with an estimated GFR (eGFR) $ 60 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 at baseline and 5 years of follow-up. <b>Concentricity,</b> a <b>measurement</b> of abnormal cardiac size, was assessed bymagnetic resonance imaging and evaluated as a continuousmeasurement and in quartiles. GFR was estimated by creatinine (eGFRcr) and cystatin C (eGFRcys). The association of con-centricity with annual eGFR decline, incident CKD, and rapid kidney function decline (. 5 % per year) was investigated using linearmixedmodels aswell as Poisson and logistic regression, respectively. Analyses adjusted for demographics, BP, diabetes, and inflammatory markers. ResultsMedian decline was 20. 8 (interquartile range, 23. 1, 20. 5) by eGFRcr. Comparedwith the lowest quartile of concentricity, persons in the highest quartile had an additional 21 % (9 %– 32 %) decline in mean eGFRcr in fully adjusted models. Concentricity was also associated with incident CKD and with rapid kidney function decline after adjustment. Conclusions Subclinical abnormalities in cardiac structure are associated with longitudinal kidney function decline independent of diabetes and hypertension. Future studies should examine mechanisms to explain these associations...|$|R
40|$|Researchers at the Timken Company {{conceived}} {{a project}} to develop an on-line instrument for wall thickness measurement of steel seamless mechanical tubing based on laser ultrasonic technology. The instrument, which has been installed and tested at a piercing mill, provides data on tube eccentricity and <b>concentricity.</b> Such <b>measurements</b> permit fine-tuning of manufacturing processes to eliminate excess material in the tube wall and therefore provide a more precisely dimensioned product for their customers. The resulting process energy savings are substantial, as is lowered environmental burden. The expected savings are $ 85. 8 million per year in seamless mechanical tube piercing alone. Applied across the industry, this measurement has a potential of reducing energy consumption by 6 x 10 {sup 12 } BTU per year, greenhouse gas emissions by 0. 3 million metric tons carbon equivalent per year, and toxic waste by 0. 255 million pounds per year. The principal technical contributors to the project were the Timken Company, Industrial Materials Institute (IMI, a contractor to Timken), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Timken provided mill access as well as process and metallurgical understanding. Timken researchers had previously developed fundamental ultrasonic analysis methods on which this project is based. IMI developed and fabricated the laser ultrasonic generation and receiver systems. ORNL developed Bayesian and wavelet based real-time signal processing, spread-spectrum wireless communication, and explored feature extraction and pattern recognition methods. The resulting instrument has successfully measured production tubes at one of Timken's piercing mills. This report concentrates on ORNL's contribution through the CRADA mechanism. The three components of ORNL's contribution were met with mixed success. The real-time signal-processing task accomplished its goal of improvement in detecting time of flight information {{with a minimum of}} false data. The signal processing algorithm development resulted in a combination of processing steps that can be set to generate no spoofs from noise, while simultaneously missing fewer than 10 % of good trials. The algorithm leads to a 95 % probability that the estimate of time of flight is good to within 4 time bins or fewer for laser excitations above 30 mJ for the first two echoes of the signal. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for the algorithm indicate that the algorithm is very robust against errors for excitations above at 35 mJ and above, tolerable at 30 mJ and unacceptable below 30 mJ...|$|R
40|$|Swirling {{flows through}} annular {{passages}} occur in many engineering applications. One area {{of particular interest}} concerns the swirling flow of fuel through injection nozzles for liquid fuel combustion systems. Within this device, very high levels of swirl are induced in the fuel to obtain a uniform dispersion of fine fuel droplets at the inlet to the combustion chamber. In view {{of the importance of}} this and other similar flows, the present work investigated the fluid mechanics of highly swirling flows within annular passages. ^ The experimental investigation documented the establishment and evolution of the internal flow field within the annular region. These measurements were done using laser Doppler velocimetry. Associated numerical results for fluid dynamics models of the flow were obtained using the TEACH code. Primary concerns were initiation of swirl via discrete jets, their mixing to produce a circumferentially uniform field, and the effects of level of swirl upon the overall flow pattern. Additional areas of interest concern flow path geometric effects on the evolution of this flow including effects of annulus <b>concentricity.</b> ^ Experimental <b>measurements</b> indicate very high levels of swirl (near tangential) generated within these geometries even though flow was admitted over a range of initial swirl angles down to 20 degrees from axial. The high levels of swirl induce axial flow distribution heavily weighted toward the outer radius with regions of axial flow reversal seen near the inner. This flow reversal is characteristic of vortex breakdown in this confined flow. Additionally, the uniformity of the velocity field was seen to be very sensitive to annulus concentricity. ^ Calculated flow fields, although limited by axisymmetry, did qualitatively show the same trends seen in measured data with high flow levels calculated near the outer radius and axial flow reversal occurring near the inner. Overall levels of calculated swirl however, were lower than measured. ...|$|R
