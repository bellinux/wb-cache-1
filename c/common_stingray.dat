5|$|The blue {{stingray}} (Dasyatis chrysonota) {{of southern}} Africa {{has long been}} regarded as {{a variant of the}} <b>common</b> <b>stingray.</b> However, the <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> lacks the blue markings of the other species and differs in morphological and meristic characters, which led the latter to be definitively recognized as a separate species by Paul Cowley and Leonard Compagno in 1993. The distinction between this species and the similar Tortonese's stingray (D. tortonesei) of the Mediterranean is poorly understood and may not be valid, requiring further investigation.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{recorded}} <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> specimen {{was found}} in 2016 in the Izmir province of Turkey {{in the course of}} a study on trolling. Its fins had a width of , although its length could not be determined as the tail had been removed earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} prey of the <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> are bottom-dwelling crustaceans, {{though it}} also takes molluscs, polychaete worms, and small bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous: the embryos are nourished by yolk and later histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females bear 4–9 young twice per year in shallow water, after a gestation period of four months. The <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> can inflict a painful, though rarely life-threatening, wound with its venomous tail spine. During classical antiquity, its sting was ascribed many mythical properties. This species is not sought after by commercial fisheries, but is taken in large numbers as bycatch and utilized for food, fishmeal, and liver oil. Its population is apparently dwindling across its range, though there is not yet sufficient data for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it beyond Data Deficient.|$|E
50|$|The Discovery Gallery {{contains}} various smaller exhibits {{that seek}} to introduce unique aspects of marine habitats. In the first exhibit {{you can see a}} shipwreck and a gas or oil drill, and a band of barbed wire. In the open pool you can feed <b>common</b> <b>stingrays.</b> Around the pool different exhibits contain seahorses, stonefish, frogfish and ribbon eels.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Leticia de Almeida Leao Vaz {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a phylogenetic analysis, based on genomic DNA, of the Brazilian large-eyed stingray {{and three other}} <b>common</b> <b>stingrays</b> found off Brazil: the southern stingray (D. americana), the longnose stingray (D. guttata), and the roughtail stingray (D. centroura). They found that D. marianae is sister to a group containing D. americana and D. centroura.|$|R
50|$|The groovebelly {{stingray}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} <b>common</b> <b>stingrays</b> caught unintentionally by artisanal and commercial shrimp bottom trawlers, mainly off Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states. This species may also be negatively affected by habitat degradation from coastal development, and water pollution. However, there is insufficient information for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess its conservation status beyond Data Deficient.|$|R
5|$|In 2001, Lisa Rosenberger {{published}} a phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species, based on morphology. The <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> {{was reported to}} be the most basal member of the genus, other than the bluespotted stingray (D. kuhlii) and pelagic stingray (D. violacea). However, D. violacea has generally been recognized as belonging to its own genus Pteroplatytrygon, and recently D. kuhlii has also been placed in a different genus, Neotrygon.|$|E
5|$|The first formal {{scientific}} {{description of}} the <b>common</b> <b>stingray,</b> as Raja pastinaca, was authored by the father of taxonomy Carl Linnaeus in the 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturae. It has since been placed in the genus Dasyatis. There are at least 25 earlier references to this ray in literature, under various non-binomial names such as Raja corpore glabro, aculeo longo anterius serrato in cauda apterygia, Pastinaca marina prima, and Pastinaca marina lævis. Many of these early accounts, including Linnaeus', also incorporated information from other species. Consequently, the designation of a lectotype is warranted {{in the interests of}} taxonomic stability, but this has yet to be enacted.|$|E
5|$|The species syntypes were {{collected}} from San Diego Bay, California. The specific epithet dipterura {{is derived from the}} Latin di ("two"), ptero ("wing"), and ura ("tail"), referring to the fin folds on both sides of its tail. Rat-tailed stingray is a former common name for this species. Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis, based on morphology, determined the diamond stingray and the bluntnose stingray (D.say) of the western Atlantic Ocean to be sister species, that likely diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama (c. 3 Ma). In addition, the two were found to be the second-most basal taxa in their genus, after the <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> (D.pastinaca).|$|E
50|$|Although {{generally}} innocuous towards humans, fishery {{workers have}} been injured by the venomous tail spine of the Yantai stingray. Envenomation by this species causes intense pain and edema, can lead to weakness, nausea, arrhythmia, paresthesia, and convulsions, and may even be fatal. Yantai stingrays are taken by coastal benthic commercial fisheries as bycatch. In Japan, where it is often mistaken for the red stingray (D. akajei), its small size typically results in captured individuals being discarded. Such {{is not the case}} in China, where the Yantai stingray is one of the three most <b>common</b> <b>stingrays</b> brought to market.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the less}} <b>common</b> <b>{{stingray}}s</b> within its range, the sharpsnout stingray is found in nearshore, brackish waters along the northeastern coast of South America, from Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago to northern Brazil; many occur in the estuarine area affected by the freshwater discharge of the Amazon River. It favors muddy habitats 5 - 25 m deep, with low visibility. However, Uyeno et al. (1983) gave a depth of 810 m for this species. The sharpsnout stingray conducts annual movements that are affected by salinity, entering coastal bays such as Marajó Bay {{during the rainy season}} and shifting to offshore waters during the rainy season.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the archaeological interest of the subaquatic park, the area {{is also an important}} registry of oceanic species and marine flora. From a medium depth of 15 m to approximately 35 m, the bottom of the bay includes rock and sand. The conditions provide useful characteristics for underwater photography, including geological features and maritime species. Since it is not considered a dangerous local area, diving both in the day and evening are possible.Here there are several marine species that are frequently visible: such as Whiteseabream or Sargo (Diplodus sargus), Common bream (Pagellus acarne), Dusky Groupers (Epinephelus marginatus), Mediterranean moray (Muraena helena), Salema porgy (Sarpa salpa), Almaco jack (Seriola rivoliana) and <b>Common</b> <b>stingrays</b> (Dasyatis pastinaca).|$|R
5|$|Though not aggressive, the <b>common</b> <b>{{stingray}}</b> can inflict an excruciating wound {{with its}} serrated, venomous tail spine. The ancient Greeks and Romans greatly feared its venom, with authors such as Aelian (175–235 AD) stating that stingray wounds were incurable. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD), in his Natural History, asserted that its spine {{was capable of}} killing trees, piercing armor like an arrow, and corroding iron. Greek poet Oppian (172–210 AD) claimed that the touch of stingray venom could even dissolve stone. In Greek mythology, Hercules {{was said to have}} lost a finger to the bite of a stingray, and Circe was said to have armed her son Telegonus with a spear tipped with a stingray spine, with which he accidentally slew his father Odysseus.|$|E
5|$|While timid and {{innocuous}} towards humans, the bluespotted ribbontail ray {{is capable}} of inflicting an excruciating wound with its venomous tail spines. Its attractive appearance and relatively small size has resulted in its being the most <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> found in the home aquarium trade. However, it seldom fares well in captivity and very few hobbyists are able to maintain one for long. Many specimens refuse to feed in the aquarium, and even seemingly healthy individuals often inexplicably die or stop feeding. A higher degree of success has been achieved by public aquariums and a breeding project is maintained by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (for example, a total of 15 pups were born at Lisbon Oceanarium from 2011 to 2013). The bluespotted ribbontail ray is utilized as food in East Africa, Southeast Asia, and Australia; it is captured intentionally or incidentally using gillnets, longlines, spears, and fence traps.|$|E
500|$|The <b>common</b> <b>{{stingray}}</b> (Dasyatis pastinaca) is {{a species}} of stingray in the family Dasyatidae, found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean and Black Seas. It typically inhabits sandy or muddy habitats in coastal waters shallower than , often burying itself in sediment. Usually measuring [...] across, the <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc slightly wider than long, and a whip-like tail with upper and lower fin folds. It can be identified by its plain coloration and mostly smooth skin, except for a row of tubercles along the midline of the back in the largest individuals.|$|E
50|$|The Yantai {{stingray}}, Dasyatis laevigata (often misspelled laevigatus), is {{a little-known}} species of stingray {{in the family}} Dasyatidae, inhabiting shallow waters in the northwestern Pacific Ocean off the coasts of China and Japan. Measuring no more than 20 - 30 cm across, this species is characterized by its diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc wider than long, completely smooth skin, dorsal coloration of dark irregular spots on a yellowish gray-brown background, and ventral coloration of more spots on a white background with yellowish margins. One of the three most <b>common</b> <b>stingrays</b> sold for food in China, the slow-reproducing Yantai stingray faces possible overfishing and habitat degradation, and its numbers appear to be declining. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Near Threatened.|$|R
40|$|A study {{observing the}} {{foraging}} behaviours and prey discrimination of a <b>common</b> demersal <b>stingray,</b> the bluespotted maskray Dasyatis kuhlii was performed under controlled laboratory conditions. A selection of prey species and masses were offered at depths of 10 and 50 mm in sand. Foraging efficiency and prey selection at both burial depths were compared. Dasyatis kuhlii selected the ghost shrimps, Trypaea australiensis and T. australiensis > 2. 5 g, range +/- 0. 2 g though foraging errors represented by prey being excavated and not consumed suggested a limited discriminatory ability {{at the point}} of detection. Burial depth did not influence prey species, mass selection or discriminatory ability...|$|R
2500|$|The lobed stingaree (Urolophus lobatus) [...] is a <b>common</b> {{species of}} <b>stingray</b> {{in the family}} Urolophidae, endemic to {{southern}} Western Australia in shallow, inshore sand and seagrass habitats. This species is plain sandy in color above and has a broad, rounded pectoral fin disc. It is characterized by an enlarged, semicircular skin lobe of unknown function on the inner rim of each nostril. Its tail is slender, with lateral skin folds and a lance-like caudal fin but no dorsal fin. The maximum recorded width is [...]|$|R
500|$|Well-documented since {{classical}} antiquity, the <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> {{was known}} as trygon (τρυγών) to the ancient Greeks and as pastinaca to the ancient Romans. An old common name for this species, used in Great Britain {{since at least the}} 18th century, is [...] "fire-flare" [...] or [...] "fiery-flare", which may refer to the reddish color of its meat.|$|E
500|$|Like other stingrays, the <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> is aplacental viviparous: {{the embryos}} are {{initially}} sustained by yolk, which is later supplemented by histotroph ("uterine milk", enriched with proteins, fat, and mucus) {{delivered by the}} mother through numerous extensions of the uterine epithelium called trophonemata. Females bear two litters of 4–9 pups per year in shallow inshore waters, following a gestation period of four months. Various authors have generally reported birthing in summer, between May and September or over a narrower timeframe such as July to August. Mature rays are known to aggregate off the Balearic Islands from mid-June to July, possibly for reproductive purposes. Newborns measure about [...] across and [...] long. Males reach sexual maturity at [...] across, and females at [...] across. The oldest known individual from the wild was ten years of age, but the species has lived up to 21 years in captivity. Known parasites of the <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> include the flukes Heterocotyle pastinacae and Entobdella diadema, and the tapeworm Scalithrium minimum.|$|E
500|$|British {{zoologist}} Francis Day, in his 1884 The Fishes of Great Britain and Ireland, {{noted that}} the <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> was not eaten because of its [...] "rank and disagreeable" [...] flesh, and that Welsh fishermen used its liver oil {{as a treatment for}} burns and other injuries. In the present day, the pectoral fins or [...] "wings" [...] of this species are sold smoked or dried and salted, and it is also utilized as a source of fishmeal and liver oil. The liver is regarded as a delicacy in French cuisine, and used to prepare dishes such as beignets de foie de raie and foie de raie en croute.|$|E
50|$|The western shovelnose stingaree (Trygonoptera mucosa) is a <b>common</b> {{species of}} <b>stingray</b> {{in the family}} Urolophidae, inhabiting shallow sandy flats and {{seagrass}} beds off southwestern Australia from Perth to Gulf St Vincent. Growing to 37 cm long, this small ray has a rounded pectoral fin disc and a blunt, broadly triangular snout. Its nostrils have enlarged lobes along the outer rims and a skirt-shaped curtain of skin between them with a strongly fringed posterior margin. Its tail ends in a lance-like caudal fin and lacks dorsal fins and lateral skin folds. This species is colored grayish to brownish above, sometimes with lighter and darker spots, and pale below, sometimes with darker marginal bands and blotches.|$|R
2500|$|The masked stingaree (Trygonoptera personata) is a <b>common</b> {{species of}} <b>stingray</b> {{in the family}} Urolophidae, endemic to southwestern Australia. It prefers {{moderately}} deep areas of sand or seagrass some distance from shore, though {{it can be found}} in very shallow water or to a depth of [...] The masked stingaree can be identified by the two large, dark blotches on the upper surface of its rounded pectoral fin disc, one of which encompasses its eyes like a mask. The outer rims of its nostrils are expanded into prominent lobes, while between the nostrils is a skirt-like curtain of skin with a deeply fringed trailing margin. Its tail bears a small dorsal fin just before the stinging spine, and end in a leaf-like caudal fin. This species grows up to [...] across.|$|R
500|$|The short-tail {{stingray}} or smooth stingray (Dasyatis brevicaudata) is a <b>common</b> {{species of}} <b>stingray</b> {{in the family}} Dasyatidae. It occurs off southern Africa, typically offshore {{at a depth of}} , and off southern Australia and New Zealand, from the intertidal zone to a depth of [...] It is mostly bottom-dwelling in nature and can be found across a range of habitats from estuaries to reefs, but also frequently swims into open water. The largest stingray in the world, this heavy-bodied species grows upwards of [...] across and [...] in weight. Its plain-colored, diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc is characterized by a lack of dermal denticles even in adults, and white pores beside the head on either side. Its tail is usually shorter than the disc and thick at the base. It is armed with large tubercles and a midline row of large thorns in front of the stinging spine which has the dorsal and ventral fin folds behind.|$|R
500|$|The <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to reach a width of [...] and a length of , though a width of [...] is more typical. The flattened pectoral fin disc is diamond-shaped and slightly wider than it is long, with narrowly rounded outer corners. The leading margins of the disc are almost straight and converge on a pointed, slightly protruding snout; the trailing margins of the disc are convex. The eyes are smaller than the spiracles (paired respiratory openings), which are placed closely behind. There are 28–38 upper tooth rows and 28–43 lower tooth rows; the teeth are small and blunt, and arranged into flattened surfaces. There are five papillae (nipple-like structures) across the floor of the mouth.|$|E
500|$|The <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> {{is found}} {{throughout}} the Mediterranean and Black Seas. It also occurs, though in significantly lower numbers, in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from southern Norway and the western Baltic Sea to Madeira and the Canary Islands. This bottom-dwelling species can be found from the shore {{to a depth of}} , though it is not usually found deeper than [...] It favors sandy or muddy bottoms in calm water, and is also sometimes encountered near rocky reefs or in estuaries, as it is tolerant of low salinity. Off the Azores, common stingrays are most abundant in summer and least abundant in winter, suggestive of a seasonal shift in range and/or depth as has been documented in other ray species.|$|E
500|$|Encountered singly or in [...] "social" [...] groups, the <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> {{appears to}} {{segregate}} by sex {{to some degree}} and may be more active at night, tending to bury itself in sediment during daytime. It feeds {{on a wide variety}} of bottom-dwelling organisms, including crustaceans, cephalopods, bivalves, polychaete worms, and small bony fishes. It is reportedly does great damage to cultured shellfish beds. One study in the Gulf of İskenderun off Turkey found that crustaceans comprised some 99% of its diet, with fish prey becoming increasingly important with age. Another study off the coast of Tarsus, Turkey, found the most important dietary component to be the penaeid shrimp Metapenaeus stebbingi, followed by the pistol shrimp Alpheus glaber and the swimming crab Charybdis longicollis; cephalopods were relatively important for males, while fishes were important for females. Common stingrays have been observed closely following each other in the presence of food, possibly to take advantage of other individuals' foraging success.|$|E
50|$|The short-tail {{stingray}} or smooth stingray (Dasyatis brevicaudata) is a <b>common</b> {{species of}} <b>stingray</b> {{in the family}} Dasyatidae. It occurs off southern Africa, typically offshore {{at a depth of}} 180 - 480 m, and off southern Australia and New Zealand, from the intertidal zone to a depth of 156 m. It is mostly bottom-dwelling in nature and can be found across a range of habitats from estuaries to reefs, but also frequently swims into open water. The largest stingray in the world, this heavy-bodied species grows upwards of 2.1 m across and 350 kg in weight. Its plain-colored, diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc is characterized by a lack of dermal denticles even in adults, and white pores beside the head on either side. Its tail is usually shorter than the disc and thick at the base. It is armed with large tubercles and a midline row of large thorns in front of the stinging spine which has the dorsal and ventral fin folds behind.|$|R
500|$|In New Zealand, {{sharks and}} rays appear to be {{important}} prey; species taken include eagle rays, long-tail and short-tail <b>stingrays,</b> <b>common</b> threshers, smooth hammerheads, blue sharks and shortfin mako sharks. With sharks, orcas may herd them {{to the surface and}} strike them with their tail flukes, while bottom-dwelling rays are cornered, pinned to the ground and taken to the surface. Killer whales can induce tonic immobility in {{sharks and rays}} by holding them upside down, rendering them helpless and incapable of injuring the whale. Some sharks suffocate within about 15 minutes while the whale holds them still, because these sharks need to move to breathe. In one incident filmed near the Farallon Islands in October 1997, a [...] female killed a [...] great white shark, apparently after swimming with it upside-down in her mouth and inducing tonic immobility in it. She and another pod member ate the shark's liver and allowed the rest of the carcass to sink. In February 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a white shark off South Australia. Interspecific competition between the two species is probable in regions where dietary preferences overlap. Killer whales have also been recorded hunting tiger sharks. In July 1992, two killer whales attacked, killed and fed on an [...] long whale shark, Rhincodon typus, in the waters off Bahia de los Angeles in Baja California.|$|R
50|$|In <b>common</b> {{with other}} <b>{{stingray}}s,</b> the longnose stingray is aplacental viviparous, {{in which the}} developing embryos are sustained by yolk and later histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females have a single functional uterus, on the left, and bear two litters of 1 - 2 pups per year, one around March and the other around November. The gestation period is 5 - 6 months long with vitellogenesis (yolk formation) occurring at the same time, such as that females can ovulate a new batch of ova and mate again immediately after giving birth. Longnose stingrays measure 12.3 - 15.3 cm across at birth. Parturition occurs in water with relatively low salinity, but the young soon move into saltier water (half to full-strength seawater). A known nursery area for this species occurs off the beaches of Caiçara do Norte in northeastern Brazil, where newborns and small juveniles have been reported from water no more than 3 m deep from February to October. Very small juveniles have also been observed in tidal pools in Ceará. Males mature at 50 - 60 cm across and females at 60 - 70 cm across. At the onset of sexual maturation, longnose stingrays move back into water with lower salinities of 20 ppt or less; females over 75 cm across are found only in salinities of under 5 ppt.|$|R
500|$|Common {{stingrays}} {{are caught}} incidentally by commercial fisheries across {{many parts of}} its range, using bottom trawls, gillnets, bottom longlines, beach seines, and trammel nets. Because of its inshore habitat preferences, this ray is more susceptible to small-scale coastal fisheries than to industrial operations, {{such as in the}} Balearic Islands, where it makes up 40% of the shark and ray trammel net catch. Surveys indicate that common stingrays have declined in the Mediterranean and the northeastern Atlantic, and may have been extirpated from the Bay of Biscay. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened in those two regions, while the species as a whole is listed under Data Deficient. The <b>common</b> <b>stingray</b> is protected within five marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Balearic Islands, and also benefits from a European Union ban on the use of trawls within [...] of the coast.|$|E
