40|$|On 7 March 2014, Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Court (ICC) convicted Germain Katanga for {{war crimes}} and crimes against humanity. Katanga's {{conviction}} {{is based on the}} concept of <b>common</b> purpose <b>liability</b> as regulated in Article 25 (3) (d) of the Rome Statute. This liability theory establishes criminal responsibility for wilfully or knowingly contributing to the crimes of a group of persons who act together pursuant to a common purpose. The ICC regards commonpurpose liability as a residual liability theory, which provides for a lower level of blameworthiness than principal forms of criminal responsibility, such as joint perpetration. This article appraises the residual and inferior status of <b>common</b> purpose <b>liability</b> by comparing the ICC's application of <b>common</b> purpose <b>liability</b> and joint perpetration. The comparison makes clear that <b>common</b> purpose <b>liability</b> in theory stipulates lower actus reus and mens rea standards than joint perpetration. However, in practice the ICC applies the requirements of both these liability theories in a context-dependent way in interplay with the particular facts of individual cases. It can therefore not be concluded in general terms that <b>common</b> purpose <b>liability</b> by definition constitutes a less serious type of criminal responsibility than joint perpetration. Instead, it is preferable to adopt a flexible approach, which recognizes that <b>common</b> purpose <b>liability</b> covers a variety of conduct entailing different levels of blameworthiness...|$|R

On the other hand, the surety may now, in any court in which the action on the guarantee is pending, avail himself of any set-off which may exist between the principal debtor and the creditor. Moreover, if one of several sureties for the same debt is sued by the creditor or his guarantee, he can, by means of a third-party complaint, claim contribution from his co-sureties towards the <b>common</b> <b>liability.</b> Independent proof of the surety's liability under his guarantee must always be given at the trial.

50|$|A surety is {{entitled}} to contribution from a co-surety in respect of their <b>common</b> <b>liability.</b> This particular right is {{not the result of}} any contract, but is derived from a equity, on the ground of equality of burden and benefit, and exists whether the sureties be bound jointly, or jointly and severally, and by the same, or different, instruments. There is, however, no right of contribution where each surety is severally bound for a given portion only of the guaranteed debt; nor {{in the case of a}} surety for a surety; nor where a person becomes a surety jointly with another and at the latter's request. Contribution may be enforced, either before payment, or as soon as the surety has paid more than his share of the common debt; and the amount recoverable is now always regulated by the number of solvent sureties, though formerly this rule only prevailed in equity. In the event of the bankruptcy of a surety, proof can be made against his estate by a co-surety for any excess over the latter's contributive share. The right of contribution is not the only right possessed by co-sureties against each other, but they are also entitled to the benefit of all securities which have been taken by any one of them as an indemnity against the liability incurred for the principal debtor.|$|E

40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} of excessive levels multivariate comorbidity {{for the major}} childhood internalizing and externalizing syndromes and / or disorders. The overall aim of this thesis is to propose a general factor to capture the common variance for the major internalising and externalising childhood syndromes and disorders. In this context, the thesis reports three empirical studies to evaluate the plausibility of a common factor, and potential risk factors that {{may be associated with}} it. Study 1, examined if childhood psychopathology could be characterised by a bifactor model, which would provide support for a common factor. The bifactor structure was tested on data from a clinical sample of 974 parents and their children referred to the Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne. Data was gained from the Syndrome and DSM-Oriented scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children-Parent Version. The model was also tested on the data from the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) Reference Group; an epidemiological sample used to validate the CBCL. The bifactor model showed excellent fit and substantive support for the hypothesised common factor. Study 2 extended Study 1 and investigated whether the major childhood syndromes/disorders conform to a circumplex structure, which would provide support for the presence of a common factor underlying these syndromes/disorders. The circumplex was tested using the same data and same measures as Study 1, and results demonstrated that child psychopathology conforms to a circumplex structure, with more than fifty percent of all variance accounted for by the common factor. This provided strong support for the presence of the hypothesised common factor. Study 3 aimed to investigate the nature of this hypothesised common factor, and investigate which constructs are associated with it. The association of three constructs – negative affective temperament, parental psychopathology and familial functioning – on the general factor specified by the bifactor model was investigated. The results demonstrated that negative affect and parental psychopathology, both individually and in interaction, appear to be key risk factors associated with the common factor. Overall, results suggest that, in contrast to current conceptualisations of childhood psychopathology as discrete and distinguishable entities, there is a <b>common</b> <b>liability</b> to all psychopathology in childhood. Such a <b>common</b> <b>liability</b> helps explain the high level comorbidity of childhood disorders and syndromes, because the liability suggests that all manifestations of psychological illness may, at least in part, have some common geneses. The results here suggest that negative affect and parental psychopathology are key risk factors in understanding this <b>common</b> <b>liability</b> factor...|$|E

40|$|Background: The use of {{cannabis}} {{and other}} illegal drugs is particularly prevalent in male young adults and {{is associated with}} severe health problems. This longitudinal study explored variables associated {{with the onset of}} cannabis use and the onset of illegal drug use other than cannabis separately in male young adults, including demographics, religion and religiosity, health, social context, substance use, and personality. Furthermore, we explored how far the gateway hypothesis and the <b>common</b> <b>liability</b> to addiction model are in line with the resulting prediction models. Methods:The data were gathered within the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors (C-SURF). Young men aged around 20 years provided demographic, social, health, substance use, and personality-related data at baseline. Onset of cannabis and other drug use were assessed at 15 -months follow-up. Samples of 2, 774 and 4, 254 individuals who indicated at baseline that they have not used cannabis and other drugs, respectively, in their life and who provided follow-up data were used for the prediction models. Hierarchical logistic stepwise regressions were conducted, in order to identify predictors of the late onset of cannabis and other drug use separately. Results: Not providing for oneself, having siblings, depressiveness, parental divorce, lower parental knowledge of peers and the whereabouts, peer pressure, very low nicotine dependence, and sensation seeking were positively associated with the onset of cannabis use. Practising religion was negatively associated with the onset of cannabis use. Onset of drug use other than cannabis showed a positive association with depressiveness, antisocial personality disorder, lower parental knowledge of peers and the whereabouts, psychiatric problems of peers, problematic cannabis use, and sensation seeking. Conclusions: Consideration of the predictor variables identified within this study may help to identify young male adults for whom preventive measures for cannabis or other drug use are most appropriate. The results provide evidence for both the gateway hypothesis and the <b>common</b> <b>liability</b> to addiction model and point to further variables like depressiveness or practising of religion that might influence the onset of drug use...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A <b>common</b> <b>liability</b> {{of cancer}} drugs is {{toxicity}} to noncancerous cells. Thus, molecules are needed that are potent toward cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. The cost of traditional cell-based HTS is {{dictated by the}} library size, which is typically {{in the hundreds of}} thousands of individual compounds. Mixture-based combinatorial libraries offer a cost-effective alternative to single-compound libraries while eliminating the need for molecular target validation. Presently, lung cancer and melanoma cells were screened in parallel with healthy cells using a mixture-based library. A novel class of compounds was discovered that selectively inhibited melanoma cell growth via apoptosis with submicromolar potency while sparing healthy cells. Additionally, the cost of screening and biological follow-up experiments was significantly lower than in typical HTS. Our findings suggest that mixture-based phenotypic HTS can significantly reduce cost and hit-to-lead time while yielding novel compounds with promising pharmacology. One of the most common liabilities of cancer drugs/drugcandidates is toxicity to noncancerous cells. Thus, molecules are needed that are potent toward cancer cells and spare healthy cells. Cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches can be used to discover such molecules. Unfortunately, the cost of HTS limits the amount and numbe...|$|E

This hypothesis-driven study was designed to determine if specific SNPs in genes related to stress response are associated with heroin and/or cocaine addiction in African Americans. The analysis included 27 genes (124 SNPs) and was performed independently for each addiction. The sample consisted of former heroin addicts in methadone maintenance treatment (n = 314), cocaine addicts (n = 281), and controls (n = 208). Fourteen SNPs showed nominally significant association with heroin addiction (p < 0. 05), including the African-specific, missense SNP rs 5376 (Asn 334 Ser) in the galanin receptor type 1 gene (GALR 1) and the functional FKBP 5 intronic SNP rs 1360780. Thirteen SNPs showed association with cocaine addiction, including the synonymous SNPs rs 237902, in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), and rs 5374 in GALR 1. No signal remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Four additional SNPs (GALR 1 rs 2717162, AVP rs 2282018, CRHBP rs 1875999, and NR 3 C 2 rs 1040288) were associated with both addictions and may indicate <b>common</b> <b>liability.</b> The study provides preliminary evidence for novel association of variants in several stress-related genes with heroin and/or cocaine addictions and may enhance the understanding of the interaction between stress and addictions...|$|E
40|$|New-style {{central banking}} in many {{advanced}} economies, involving {{the use of}} unconventional monetary policy instruments and forward guidance at the effective lower bound for interest rates, has {{raised questions about the}} appropriate role of fiscal policy – also in the euro area, where a fiscal counterpart to the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Eurosystem is missing. This paper considers three areas where euro area governments could act as the ‘joint sovereign’ behind the euro and support the ECB in its task of maintaining price stability, staying within the boundaries of the Maastricht Treaty. First, member countries could coordinate a growth-friendly aggregate economic policy mix that is supportive of the single monetary policy, {{with the help of a}} central fiscal capacity subject to common decision-making. Second, they could introduce a safe sovereign asset for the eurozone without assuming <b>common</b> <b>liability</b> in order to anchor financial integration and facilitate monetary policy implementation. Third, the significant benefits for the Eurosystem from a lower burden on monetary policy and a reduced exposure to sovereign risk could make it acceptable for euro area governments to indemnify it against potential large losses on its much expanded balance sheet.
