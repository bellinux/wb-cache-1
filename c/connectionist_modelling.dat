40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the idea of}} using Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) to create <b>connectionist</b> <b>models</b> is introduced. L-systems with some {{extensions}} provide us with a method for creating <b>connectionist</b> <b>models</b> with a close analogy to the growing process of nature. The main advantages to use L-systems in <b>connectionist</b> <b>modeling</b> is its capability for controling growth of <b>connectionist</b> <b>model.</b> Starting from a small initial state, the <b>connectionist</b> <b>model</b> is grown using a simple set of production rules. Learning is part of growth, where it can be implemented as a modification of connection parameter values or as a creation or deletion of connections themselves.

40|$|A long-standing {{debate in}} {{perception}} concerns {{the question of}} whether perceptual organization is guided by internal efficiency (the simplicity principle) or by external veridicality (the likelihood principle). This article focuses on the simplicity principle which is a modern information-theoretic version of Occam’s razor, but also compares it to the likelihood principle which reflects classical information theory. Both principles can be modelled by Bayes’ rule which combines quantifications of view-independent and view-dependent factors to predict stimulus interpretations. Whereas the likelihood principle relies on hardly quantifiable frequencies of occurrence of things in the world, the simplicity principle relies on better quantifiable structural complexities of individual things. The simplicity principle is further argued to be sufficiently veridical in everyday perception, and neurally realizable via cognitive architecture enabling transparallel processing.

40|$|How {{the brain}} co-ordinates {{the actions of}} distant regions in an {{efficient}} manner is an open problem. Many believe that cross-frequency coupling between the amplitude of high frequency local field potential oscillations in one region and the phase of lower frequency signals in another may form a possible mechanism. This work provides a preliminary study from both an experimental and theoretical viewpoint, concentrating on possible coupling between the hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex in rats during tasks involving working memory, spatial navigation and decision making processes. Attempts to search for such coupling events are made using newly developed MATLAB scripts.

40|$|In {{the first}} section of the article, we examine some recent criticisms of the connectionist enterprise: first, that <b>connectionist</b> <b>models</b> are {{fundamentally}} behaviorist in nature (and, therefore, non-cognitive), and second that <b>connectionist</b> <b>models</b> are fundamentally associationist in nature (and, therefore, cognitively weak). We argue that, for a limited class of <b>connectionist</b> <b>models</b> (feed-forward, pattern-associator models), the first criticism is unavoidable. With respect to the second criticism, we propose that <b>connectionist</b> <b>models</b> are fundamentally associationist but that this is appropriate for building models of human cognition.

40|$|For {{the study}} of {{psychological}} processes in cognitive science modelling two general approaches rule nowadays research: Artificial Intelligence (top-down) functional symbolic models, and Connectionist (bottom-up) neural networks modelling.

The lack of biological constraints, network stability or serial behaviour, for example, are relevant issues to bear in mind. Our proposed model, conceptual networks, can be located halfway between the traditional semantic networks and artificial neural networks modelling, and is presented as an attempt of building a necessary bridge between this levels of description, focussing on the correspondence between the functional level and the level that can be modelled by artificial neural networks. The elements and functioning of conceptual networks are based in biological and psychological constraints necessary to build realistic models of actual cognitive processes in brain functioning...|$|E
40|$|In Chinese orthography, phonetic {{compounds}} comprise about 80 % of {{the most}} frequent characters. They contain separate phonological and semantic elements, referred to as phonetic and semantic radicals respectively.

40|$|Cognitive {{scientists}} were not quick {{to embrace the}} functional neuroimaging technologies that emerged during the late 20 th century. In this new century, cognitive scientists continue to question, not unreasonably, the relevance of functional neuroimaging investigations that fail to address questions of interest to cognitive science. However, some ultra-cognitive scientists assert that these experiments can never be of relevance {{to the study of}} cognition. Their reasoning reflects an adherence to a functionalist philosophy that arbitrarily and purposefully distinguishes mental information-processing systems from brain or brain-like operations. This article addresses whether data from properly conducted functional neuroimaging studies can inform and subsequently constrain the assumptions of theoretical cognitive models. The article commences with a focus upon the functionalist philosophy espoused by the ultra-cognitive scientists, contrasting it with the materialist philosophy that motivates both cognitive neuroimaging investigations and <b>connectionist</b> <b>modelling</b> of cognitive systems. Connectionism and cognitive neuroimaging share many features, including an emphasis on unified cognitive and neural models of systems that combine localist and distributed representations.

40|$|Although much of {{cognitive}} science assumes that literal categories {{are central to}} cognition, there is scant evidence for a psychologically meaningful distinction between the literal and nonliteral. We advance {{the idea that there}} is, in fact, no principled difference between literal and nonliteral comparisons; each is a different type of contextual modulation of semantic knowledge. Generally, the context specificity of human thought is viewed by some as ‘mysterious ’ under current models of cognition (e. g. Fodor, 2000). Using <b>connectionist</b> <b>modelling,</b> we demonstrate a simple computational principle by which this contextual modulation might be achieved, beginning with a simple five-unit network, then showing how the principle scales to more complex models of semantic memory and metaphor comprehension, establishing that the similarity structure of semantic knowledge can be fluidly manipulated by context within a structurally fixed processing structure. The theory of metaphor suggested by this computational view prompts a particular view of the relation between language and thought, namely that language affords the strategic control of context on semantic knowledge, allowing information to be brought to bear in a given situation that might otherwise not be available to influence processing. The implications of such a view for creativity and the nature of categories are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with quantifying the factors that affect order of acquisition in phonological development in English. As Menn and Stoel-Gammon (1995) observe, {{the question of the}} order of acquisition of the phonemes of English is problematic: acquisition varies between children learning the same language; related allophones are acquired at different times; acquiring a phoneme may not mean that the relevant phonemic contrasts have been acquired; position of the target phoneme in the syllable, together with the other contents of the syllable, affects pronunciation. Nevertheless, the literature does contain observed orders of acquisition of English, together with claims concerning the factors determining that order. Below, we first employ multiple regression analysis {{to determine the extent to}} which a reported order of acquisition can be accounted for by phonological and distributional factors. We then compare this conventional statistical modelling with a <b>connectionist</b> <b>modelling</b> approach. In the light of the caveats listed above, the current explorations will determine whether a particular reported order of acquisition is susceptible to a parsimonious statistical description [...] can a large part of the variance be accounted for by only a few variables?

40|$|Our {{interdisciplinary}} {{research focuses on}} the application of <b>connectionist</b> <b>modelling</b> techniques {{to the study of}} language disorders. In recent years, artificial neural network models of aphasia have enabled cognitive neuropsychologists to explore contemporary theories of language processing. Such work may, in the future, lead to the development of innovative strategies for the rehabilitation of brain-damaged patients. The aim of our work has been to analyse the modelling techniques employed in existing connectionist accounts of language disorders, and, on the basis of our findings, to propose novel and computationally well-grounded architectures which may be used to explore cognitive neuropsychological theories. The majority of connectionist language disorder models reported in the literature may be categorised as network-level models, consisting of a single homogeneous structure built from identical processing elements. We believe that in order to simulate more fully the complexity of human language processing, {{it may be necessary to}} move away from this approach, in favour of nervous system-level models, in which a number of network-level models are interconnected to form a modular connectionist architecture. The suitability of these architectures for language disorder simulation has been assessed through the construction of LISA: a Language Impairment Simulation Architecture. LISA comprises a number of linked connectionist networks which have been collectively trained to simulate object naming and word repetition. By lesioning one or more components of our modular system, it is possible to simulate the impaired language production of an aphasic patient. We present our attempts to simulate an acquired disorder of repetition, deep dysphasia, and a progressive disorder, semantic dementia, using LISA. The results of our experiments are encouraging, and lead us to conclude that the cognitive neuropsychology community may indeed benefit from the use of modular connectionist architectures in the simulation of both progressive and acquired language disorders...|$|E
40|$|Visual {{search is}} a {{commonly}} used experimental procedure to explore human processing of visual multiple object scene (Wolfe, 1998 b). This thesis introduces a new computational model of visual search, termed Selective Attention for Identification model (SAIM). SAIM aims to solve translation invariant object identification in a <b>connectionist</b> <b>modelling</b> framework. The thesis demonstrates that SAIM can successfully simulate the following experimental evidence: symmetric searches (L amongst Ts and/or upside down Ts (Duncan & Humphreys, 1989; Egeth & Dagenbach, 1991)), asymmetric searches of oriented lines (Treisman & Gormican, 1988), line size (Treisman & Gormican, 1988), item complexity (Treisman & Souther, 1985; Rauschenberger & Yantis, 2 (06)) and familiarity (Wang, Cavanagh, & Green, 1994; Shen & Reingold, 2 (01)), {{the influence of}} distractor (non-targets) orientation (Foster & Ward, 1991; Foster & Westland, 1995), effects of priming (Hodsoll & Humphreys, 2001; Mueller, Reimann, & Krummenacher, 2003; Wolfe, Butcher, Lee, & Hyle, 2003; Anderson, Heinke, & Humphreys, 2 (06)) and 'contextual cueing' (Chun & Jiang, 1998). Crucially, SAIM's success emerges from the competition of objects for object identification. This competition is chiefly influenced by three factors: the similarity between search targets and non-targets (distractors), the visual features of the distractors, e. g., line orientation, {{and the influence of}} the object identification stage on the selection process (top-down modulation). On the other hand, a detailed reView in this thesis highlights that none of the existing computational models and theories can satisfactorily account for these experimental results. Instead, each theoretical account contains only a subset of the factors suggested by SAIM and, therefore, can explain only a subset of the experimental data. In SAIM these factors are pulled together into a unifying approach of parallel competitive interaction towards visual search. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{a critical}} issue in psycholinguistics, of whether the fundamental unit of representation in the mental lexicon is the morpheme. Are complex words, such as darkness, processed as whole forms or are they decomposed into their component morphemes dark and -ness? Research on this topic has provided preliminary evidence for decomposition by showing that response times to polymorphemic words such as darkness are influenced by summed frequency of the other words in the language containing the root morpheme (e. g. darken, darkly, darkish, etc). This thesis uses multivariate regression techniques to explore in greater depth than previously, {{both in terms of}} numbers of items and numbers of variables, the role of morphology in lexical access. It explores not only whether words are influenced by the summed frequency of the morpheme but also whether whole word frequency is important. It also asks whether for singular nouns the word-form frequency (the frequency of the form itself) or the lemma frequency (the summed frequency of all inflectional variants) is the better predictor of response times. Additionally, the role of meaning relationships between words sharing a morpheme {{and the role of the}} productivity of the suffix (the likelihood that a new form will be coined with a suffix) are investigated. Results showed that for singular nouns in standard lexical decision, the frequency of the form itself was a better predictor of response times than the lemma frequency. The semantic relationships between items and the complex forms in which they are root morphemes were also shown to be predictive of response times. However, when sampled at an earlier time point in processing, using lexical decision with a response deadline, lemma frequency was the better predictor and semantic effects were not significant. Response times to derived words were influenced both by the frequency of the root morpheme and the frequency of the form itself. The productivity of the suffix was also important. Productive items showed significantly stronger effects of morphemic frequency and of the semantic relatedness between the derived form and its stem. Distributed <b>connectionist</b> <b>modelling</b> captured important aspects of the behavioural data indicating that some aspects of morphology may be an emergent property of regularities in the mapping between form and meaning in morphologically complex forms.
