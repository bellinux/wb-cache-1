5|$|Blackleg is a {{fungal disease}} of <b>canola</b> {{that results in}} major yield loss in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) that is left on farm fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until the stubble is buried or broken down completely. The observation that C.olla grows and fruits on <b>canola</b> stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade <b>canola</b> stubble, and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne diseases like blackleg and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize <b>canola,</b> wheat, and barley residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of <b>canola</b> as compared to the cereal residue.|$|E
5|$|Crops include barley, winter wheat, spring wheat, <b>canola</b> and {{vegetables}} such as potato.|$|E
5|$|Mustard oil, {{shown to}} be {{comparable}} to <b>Canola</b> oil as a biofuel.|$|E
5|$|Rapeseed oil, {{including}} <b>Canola</b> oil, one of {{the most}} widely used cooking oils.|$|E
5|$|Colza oil, from Brassica rapa, var. oleifera (turnip) {{is closely}} related to {{rapeseed}} (or <b>canola)</b> oil. It is a major source of biodiesel in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Crops include barley, winter wheat, spring wheat, <b>canola,</b> peas, cabbage, carrots, eggplant, cucumbers, lettuce, spinach, green peppers, pumpkins, {{potatoes}} and other greenhouse crops.|$|E
5|$|Original recipes {{featuring}} animal fat-infused mayonnaise, including Baconnaise, {{were covered}} on the Serious Eats website. The recipe includes crumbled bacon strips, liquid rendered bacon fat, <b>canola</b> oil, egg yolks, and Dijon mustard {{with water and}} lemon juice.|$|E
5|$|Waseca is {{a village}} of 154 in 2011. Maidstone, a town of 1,156 in 2011 {{is home to the}} rural {{municipality}} office for Eldon No. 471 and the Maidstone Campground. In 1975, a <b>canola</b> (rapeseed) plant statue was built alongside the Yellowhead in the centre of the town of Maidstone.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, lard {{is used to}} fry the chicken, but corn oil, peanut oil, <b>canola</b> oil, or {{vegetable}} oil are also frequently used (although clarified butter {{may be used as}} well like in colonial times). The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too strong to be used for traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use. There are three main techniques for frying chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting.|$|E
5|$|Canada {{is one of}} the few {{developed}} nations that are net exporters of energy. Atlantic Canada possesses vast offshore deposits of natural gas, and Alberta also hosts large oil and gas resources. The vastness of the Athabasca oil sands and other assets results in Canada having a 13% share of global oil reserves, comprising the world's third-largest share after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies are one of the most important global producers of wheat, <b>canola,</b> and other grains. Canada's Ministry of Natural Resources provides statistics regarding its major exports; the country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal and lead. Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustainable because of nearby mines or sources of timber. Canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves eat almost {{exclusively}} seeds, {{which make up}} more than 99% of their diet. Rarely, they will eat snails or insects. Mourning doves generally eat enough to fill their crops and then fly away to digest while resting. They often swallow grit such as fine gravel or sand to assist with digestion. The species usually forages on the ground, walking but not hopping. At bird feeders, mourning doves are attracted to one of the largest ranges of seed types of any North American bird, with a preference for <b>canola,</b> corn, millet, safflower, and sunflower seeds. Mourning doves do not dig or scratch for seeds, though they will push aside ground litter; instead they eat what is readily visible. They will sometimes perch on plants and eat from there.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Dawson Creek {{is based on}} four major industries: agriculture, retail, tourism, and oil and gas. Agriculture has {{historically}} been the most important industry to Dawson Creek, as the city is the regional transshipment point for agricultural commodities. The city is surrounded by the Agricultural Land Reserve, where the soil can support livestock and produces consistently good yields of quality grain and grass crops, such as <b>canola,</b> hay, oats, alfalfa, wheat, and sweet clover. The service and retail sector caters to the city's inhabitants, smaller nearby towns, and rural communities. However, there is significant retail leakage to Grande Prairie, the closest major Alberta city, {{where there is no}} provincial tax on retail purchases, while British Columbia charges 7%. In 2006, the BC government rejected a proposal to lower the sales tax in the province's border communities to 4%. The problem of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years by the introduction of large-format retail stores into the small city. Residents still cross the border for high-priced items but now also purchase medium- and low-priced items from foreign-owned large-format chain stores.|$|E
25|$|The {{state is}} the leading {{producer}} of many oilseeds, including 92% of the U.S. <b>canola</b> crop, 94% of flax seed, 53% of sunflower seeds, 18% of safflower seeds, and 62% of mustard seed. <b>Canola</b> is suited to the cold winters and it matures fast. Processing of <b>canola</b> for oil production produces <b>canola</b> meal as a by-product. The by-product is a high-protein animal feed.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the mustard}} family (Brassicaceae), such as cabbage, cauliflower, <b>canola,</b> and crambe, do not {{establish}} arbuscular mycorrihizal fungi on their roots.|$|E
25|$|Common crops {{produced}} using irrigation include rice, cotton, <b>canola,</b> sugar, various {{fruits and}} other tree crops and pasture, hay and grain {{for use in}} beef and dairy production.|$|E
25|$|Agribusiness giant Bunge Limited, {{through their}} Bunge Oils division, are now {{producing}} and marketing an NT product line of non-hydrogenated oils, margarines and shortenings, made from corn, <b>canola,</b> and soy oils.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of cooking oils from plant sources such as olive oil, palm oil, soybean oil, <b>canola</b> oil (rapeseed oil), corn oil, peanut oil and other {{vegetable}} oils, as well as animal-based oils like butter and lard.|$|E
25|$|Apple {{orchards}} {{were once}} one of the major industries in the region and thrived until the mid-1960s. Today, viticulture, wheat, <b>canola,</b> plantation timber, sheep and cattle are some of the main agricultural activities still carried out around Mount Barker.|$|E
25|$|Mayo Clinic has {{highlighted}} certain oils {{that are}} high in saturated fats, including coconut, palm oil and palm kernel oil. Those having lower amounts of saturated fats {{and higher levels of}} unsaturated (preferably monounsaturated) fats like olive oil, peanut oil, <b>canola</b> oil, soy and cottonseed oils are generally healthier. The US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute urged saturated fats be replaced with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, listing olive and <b>canola</b> oils as sources of healthier monounsaturated oils while soybean and sunflower oils as good sources of polyunsaturated fats. One study showed that consumption of non-hydrogenated unsaturated oils like soybean and sunflower are preferable to the consumption of palm oil for lowering the risk of heart disease.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{when the}} first genetically {{modified}} crops-such as glyphosate-resistant corn, <b>canola,</b> soybean and cotton—were introduced, no glyphosate-resistant weeds were known to exist. By 2014, glyphosate-resistant weeds dominated herbicide-resistance research. At that time, 23 glyphosate-resistant species were found in 18 countries.|$|E
25|$|Food-grade {{rapeseed}} oil (also known as <b>canola</b> oil, rapeseed 00 oil, low erucic acid {{rapeseed oil}}, LEAR oil, and rapeseed canola-equivalent oil) is regulated {{to a maximum}} of 2% erucic acid by weight in the USA and 5% in the EU, with special regulations for infant food.|$|E
25|$|Bunge is an oilseed {{processing}} plant and Canada’s largest <b>canola</b> processor. It has crushing facilities in Altona and Harrowby, Manitoba; Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta; and Nipawin, Saskatchewan {{in addition to}} the {{processing plant}} in Hamilton. The Hamilton plant serves food manufacturers, the biodiesel industry and farmers in Ontario & Quebec. The first Tim Hortons franchise opened in Hamilton in 1964.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, a {{state-owned}} short-line railroad {{in eastern}} Washington ran {{a test of}} a 25% biodiesel / 75% petrodiesel blend {{during the summer of}} 2008, purchasing fuel from a biodiesel producer sited along the railroad tracks. The train will be powered by biodiesel made in part from <b>canola</b> grown in agricultural regions through which the short line runs.|$|E
25|$|Thin slices or {{strips of}} {{vegetables}} or seafood are dipped in the batter, then briefly deep-fried in hot oil. Vegetable oil or <b>canola</b> oil are most common; however, tempura was traditionally cooked using sesame oil. Many specialty shops still use sesame oil or tea seed oil, {{and it is}} thought certain compounds in these oils help to produce light, crispier batter.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, oils can be {{heated and}} used to cook other foods. Oils {{suitable}} for this objective must have a high flash point. Such oils include the major cooking oils – soybean, rapeseed, <b>canola,</b> sunflower, safflower, peanut, cottonseed, etc. Tropical oils, such as coconut, palm, and rice bran oils, are particularly valued in Asian cultures for high-temperature cooking, because of their unusually high flash points.|$|E
25|$|On 19 May 2009 it was {{announced}} that Viterra (formerly Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, becoming Viterra after acquisition of Agricore United), the largest grain handler in Canada, would acquire ABB Grain of Adelaide, South Australia in September 2009. The Head Office would be relocated to Regina, with the worldwide malting headquarters remaining in Adelaide. The two companies together are responsible for 37 percent of the world's exports of wheat, <b>canola</b> and barley.|$|E
25|$|Fort St. John is {{east of the}} Rocky Mountains, {{and thus}} has a climate much more similar to the prairies than the British Columbia {{interior}} west of the mountains. The frost-free period is much longer east of the mountains than west, and thus the Peace River area including Fort St. John can grow crops that cannot be grown {{in most of the}} province such as wheat and <b>canola.</b>|$|E
25|$|Commercial sale {{of genetically}} {{modified}} foods began in 1994, when Calgene first marketed its unsuccessful Flavr Savr delayed-ripening tomato. Most food modifications have primarily focused on cash crops in high demand by farmers such as soybean, corn, <b>canola,</b> and cotton. Genetically modified crops have been engineered for resistance to pathogens and herbicides and for better nutrient profiles. GM livestock have been developed, although as of November 2013 none were on the market.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that consumption of foods containing high amounts of saturated fatty acids (including meat fats, milk fat, butter, lard, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil) is potentially less healthy than consuming fats with a lower proportion of saturated fatty acids. Sources of lower saturated fat but higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids include olive oil, peanut oil, <b>canola</b> oil, avocados, corn, sunflower, soy, and cottonseed oils.|$|E
25|$|Early {{farming in}} Willow Bunch’s {{district}} saw high activity in grain production. In the early 1900s, oats {{were the most}} commonly grown (average of 21 yields), and wheat followed (eight yields). Wheat and oats remained popular during the 1920s, and barley emerged as another highly popular grain (producing more bushels than wheat during this period). The popularity and profitability of wheat fluctuated during the economic hardships of the 1930s, and began to stabilize during the 1940s. Although {{the early part of}} the decade (1942−1944) saw wheat yields reach tens of thousands of bushels harvested, the rate dropped by 12% in 1945 before marginally improving in 1946. Bushel yields increased and decreased throughout the 1940s before settling at 21,780 bushels (a 10-year high) in 1950. This decade marked a healthier growing period which (barring occasional bad years) produced 12,000-20,000 bushels every year. Towards the end of the 20th century, new grain types entered the market; durum and <b>canola</b> entered the market in the 1970s, while the 1980s saw the introduction of tame hay and a temporary disappearance of <b>canola.</b> Even through these crop changes, wheat varieties and oats produced consistently high yields.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture, the {{traditional}} {{industry in the}} region, continues to {{play a significant role}} in Steinbach's economy as well. The agricultural industry in the area is notable for many of the large commercial pig, and poultry farming operations. Aside from intensive pig and chicken barns there are numerous small, family, dairy farms that dot the area. Crops grown on the fertile farmland surrounding Steinbach primarily include <b>canola,</b> corn, alfalfa, as well as barley, soybeans, oats, and wheat.|$|E
25|$|Palm oil {{contains}} more saturated fats than <b>canola</b> oil, corn oil, linseed oil, soybean oil, safflower oil, and sunflower oil. Therefore, palm oil can withstand deep frying at higher temperatures and is resistant to oxidation compared to high-polyunsaturated vegetable oils. Since about 1900, palm oil has been increasingly incorporated into food {{by the global}} commercial food industry because it remains stable in deep frying, or in baking at very high temperatures, and for its high levels of natural antioxidants.|$|E
25|$|Irrigation {{differs from}} dryland farming (farming relying on rainfall) in Australia in its level of {{intensity}} and production. Common crops produced using irrigation include rice, cotton, <b>canola,</b> sugar, various fruits and other tree crops and pasture, hay and grain {{for use in}} beef and dairy production. Surface irrigation {{is the most common}} irrigation method in Australia, with drip and center pivot also utilised. All rights to use and control water are vested in the state, which issues conditional entitlements for water use.|$|E
25|$|Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an {{omega-3 fatty}} acid, {{is found in}} leafy green {{vegetables}} and nuts, and in vegetable oils such as <b>canola</b> and flaxseed oil. Iodine supplementation may be necessary for vegans in countries where salt is not typically iodized, where it is iodized at low levels, or where, as in Britain and Ireland, dairy products are relied upon for iodine delivery because of low levels in the soil. Iodine {{can be obtained from}} most vegan multivitamins or regular consumption of seaweeds, such as kelp.|$|E
25|$|The {{fire had}} a catastrophic {{impact upon the}} rural {{industry}} of Lower Mid North, Light River and west Barossa regions. A large quantity of livestock perished in the fire, including 53,600 poultry, 17,000 sheep, 500 pigs, 87 cattle, 19 horses and three Alpaca. Many of the livestock were buried in mass graves across the region. Approximately two-thirds of the area burned in the Pinery fire was estimated to have been paddocks and fields of produce; 120,000 tonnes of agricultural crops—including wheat, barley, <b>canola,</b> lentils and chickpeas—with a value of up to A$40million were destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture is {{the main}} {{occupation}} {{of the people in}} rural parts of the region. Cotton, soyabean and jawar (sorghum) are the essential crops grown in the district. Other important crops of the region are wheat, sunflower, <b>canola,</b> peanut, Bajra (pearl millet), Harbara (chick peas), Toor (pigeon peas), Urad and Moong (green gram). Most crops are dependent on the monsoon. Only 15% of Maharashtra's gross cropped area is irrigated, compared with the national average of 32.9% in 1989–90. Vidarbha's Amravati division's (including Akola District) share of gross cropped area under irrigation of 9%.|$|E
